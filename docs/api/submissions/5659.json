Some handle it better than others and some cope with it the best they can with the tools they have available to them. You acting this way is is more you being the child than the other passenger.

Just wait, they will soon grow up and become preteens/teenagers.  I pray others treat your children better in public than you just did this family. \n-  despite you being a horrible human being, Merry Christmas.", "YTA", "YTA. As you said, the flight was between two places whose distance could have been driven - so it must not have been a very long flight.

People on planes are annoying. Everyone is to someone else. That's why we learn to ignore people's quirks. It's called growing as an adult.\nThat poor girl wasn't doing anything to you.

You harassed a literal child about her legitimate medically diagnosed phobia.", "Wow you obviously know you\u2019re the AH because you used a throwaway account. How the hell do you think you\u2019re not wrong?", "YTA. You expected the Dad to take her on plane prior merely for YOUR convenience in that moment but you weren\u2019t willing to fix that short temper before that moment? A short temper is simply immaturity, the ability to manage your anger is something that comes as you grow up, so I strongly recommend you live up to the expectations you put on complete strangers, especially scared teenage children.", "YTA. \n\nAs you said, the distance was close enough to drive. Maybe if you can\u2019t stand to coexist with others traveling during the holidays, you should have driven by yourself and skipped the flight.", "YTA I wish some completely irrational and annoying phobia on you that you discover by accident when you are trapped in a small space that you cannot escape. For hours.", "YTA\nHow exactly did you think you telling the man and his daughter how she \"should\" be to please a total stranger was going to work? Did you expect that you saying that was going to magically change her? There's this thing called noise cancellation headphones.

Someone had a GENUINE fear and you could have shown a small amount of compassion during the holiday season but instead ridiculed the girl.", "Also, YTA", "So OP making fun of a literal child for a medically diagnosed condition doesnt make her a AH?", "Agreed. I can imagine how they both treat and raise their kids\u2026\u2026fucking sad. This is what\u2019s wrong with the world today.", "You do understand that by saying the flight was barely an hour long, and yet you couldn't tolerate the teenager, makes you sound even extra extra the asshole.\n\nYTA XXTA", "Sounds like a you problem OP. You didn\u2019t come prepared. Don\u2019t take it out on others.", "If this is how you behave, maybe you should not go out in public. Her fidgeting and stressing is NOTHING compared to your abusive behaviour.", "You made an already hard situation even worse. You know you're the AH here. Is this how you'd treat your own child if they were frightened? Would you appreciate a stranger snapping at them in a similar situation?", "Yeah... Even without the phobia, people are allowed to talk and move.  It's been a second since I've flown everywhere, but are we all playing the quiet game now?  This is ridiculous, what an unpleasant person you are to harass a kid and her father.  Your post is incredibly ableist.  How disappointing.  Examine your anger issues and look into getting some help.  YTA.", "Yta. You should have brought headphones. This is you problem not her problem. You need to learn to have more compassion and be more understanding.", "You don't care about her feelings? Well, they don't care about yours. Stfu AH", "Wow it's almost like those things are symptoms of an anxiety attack because she was being faced with a huge phobia. YTA 100% and your lack of empathy is nearing psychopathic levels. \n\nI'm actually floored that you, a so-called adult, thought your behavior was even slightly appropriate. You seem like the type to scream at a new parent because their baby is crying on a plane.", "her crime was fidgeting? what a fucking ah you are", "Oh no, the horror! They were fidgeting and speaking *repeatedly*! How dare they!\n\nSo what did you expect? Everyone around you to be perfectly silent and still the entire time to appease your delicate sensitivities? I\u2019d hate to think how you would\u2019ve imploded if there was a cranky baby on the plane, yikes.", "you\u2026 don\u2019t care that someone on the plane has feelings but they\u2019re all supposed to care about yours and you lack of planning? it sounds like he\u2019s being a good dad to his daughter who is flying even though it\u2019s a struggle for her. YTA. I hope their flight home is better", "Imagine having to change seats during 1 hour flight to get away from a major AH who was on some sort of power trip, and you were on a power trip, you saw someone struggling, and you made it worse for them, so much worse they switched seats to get away from you, and the fact other passengers saw what an AH you are and swapped seats should make you realise you're an absolute AH.", "YTA\n\nLighten up", "You had a temper tantrum about a flight that lasted less than an hour?!\n\nYTA and a hypocrite for expect this child to have perfect self control over a phobia when you, an adult, can control your temper.", "Invest in headphones? Tf??", "you\u2019re mad at her for not being able to control herself for less than a hour when you ALSO couldn\u2019t control yourself for less than a hour. her behavior shows that she was having an anxiety attack or something similar, learn some compassion and stop thinking the world should be comfortable for you 24/7.", "How long was the flight?", "Dude, I have severe misophonia where each of those things individually would make my skin hurt in rage and even i would be able to recognize that the poor kid was worse for wear than I was and keep my trap shut. I feel bad for your kids. Jeez", "So you couldn't hold your temper for a single hour, in other words. \n\nYou were cruel and ableist. You made this experience worse for this young person. She did nothing to harm you; she just fidgeted and repeated a phrase. She was scared. For all you know, this was her first flight. You probably made it harder, not easier, to overcome that fear.", "Oh I agree, I should've put that there. Damn.", "What if this flight is something her therapist suggested?", "It's like the people who say they're just \"blunt\" and \"telling it like it is\". No hon, you're just an asshole when you think you can get away with it. Because guaranteed you don't talk to your Nana like that.", "I\u2019m wondering now if her pointing out the daughter was \u201cdefinitely a teenager\u201d means she was in the younger side of that and this a*hole is just trying to justify her clearly horrid behavior by saying that. \n\nYTA so much, OP", "She probably would be the one snapping at her kids.", "Oh good point. You're right, no need to say that unless the kid was very much on the younger side which makes it even worse.", "You're probably right. No wonder her family was so quick to call her the AH. I feel sorry for the husband, her kids, and anyone else who has to deal with someone so explosive."]}
