You wouldn't be able to get to it without a lot of scratches. His backyard looks nice. Manicured lawn, nice patio, hot tub etc. Most likely just didn't want to look at it.", "Or you could not be a narc.", "No, no you thank him and the park on the park\u2019s page with a picture or video of the area and tag him in it. Then play dumb when others start helping themselves and he gets pissed", "This would solve the problem toot sweet!", "I understand, and agree that removing plants from a property he doesn't own is wrong. I guess what I'm saying is that if invasive species are the concern the park is doomed no matter where they're planted in his yard.", "If the yard shares a boundary with the park that imaginary line isn't going to keep invasive species out", "What happened in that Elvis movie where they all camped out on a beach and said they were homesteaders or something like that? And then a casino moved in and ruined the neighborhood.", "It took all of 30 seconds online. The internet is weird that way.", "Why wouldn't you research it if what you thought is public park is suddenly used by your neighbor?", "Ok, how about this: Is it ok if I cut down a tree from my local park for firewood? Is it ok for the mayor to use $100 of city funds for a new pair of shoes?\n\nOf course my example was hyperbolic. That was the point, to illustrate my disagreement with your reasoning.", "It's an analogy. That's how they work.", "Lol. I stand technically corrected.", "I don't see it going well knocking on someone's door and asking them to remove a garden when they clearly have zero regard for their neighbors in the first place. And I'm not really sure what you mean by helping them finish the garden. It's not like he planted some tomatoes and he'll put everything back how it was when they're done. He's made a permanent garden in a public space. Which just seems oddly entitled to me.", "No it\u2019s Adverse Possession. Conversion does not apply to Real Property.", "Parks are pretty clearly marked for their boundaries besides the OP said the garden maker has the garden outside of their fence", "What? By your logic, if I see my neighbor being robbed, I should just sit back because it's not on my property? Or ... more analogous, if I know the mayor is stealing city funds to buy himself a beach house, I should stay quiet?", "You are so wrong. Public property belongs to everyone", "This is saying it's okay to steal if it affects everyone equally.", "By your logic nobody could report it.", "It is his business because the park is for everyone, so it his property it\u2019s also the selfish fucks property but not for stealing public land. I would personally report these type of arrogant selfish fucks every time I saw them doing this type of shit. Why is this so hard for you to understand that the park is for certain things taking it over is not one of them.", "I\u2019m gonna blow your mind: a public park belongs to\u2026 the public!", "That it's not on OP's private property is irrelevant.  You might as well argue that reporting a suspicious abandoned package / bag at an airport would make someone an asshole, based on your logic.", "Not really since it\u2019s a public park. The public (to which op belongs) has a legit interest in its abuse.", "Is it possible that he asked and got permission to use the space for a garden?", "If you have to go looking for it how is it an eyesore", "Idk man if you haven't talked to the man and don't know what his intentions are you're just speculating. Maybe ask him what it's about first, don't come off like your angry just curious and if it turns out he's doing for the reasons you say then I'd report him.", "And what would be gained from that?  \n\nIf you want to do drugs in your own home, I won\u2019t narc if it doesn\u2019t affect me.  You want to try to take over public land, I\u2019ll tell early and often.  \n\nThings stay broken when people refuse to speak up.", "Upvote for using the term toot sweet", "r/BoneAppleTea", "True. However cities have policies regarding what type of plants are acceptable for planting in your yard, where you can plant, and how they should be maintained. There are even restrictions depending on based on where you live (urban/rural) and regarding different aspects of tending/owning a garden (fencing, digging, root depth, water requirements, length of grass, compost/fertilizer, etc). They fine violators and require them to remove the plants, however even that isn\u2019t perfect. People have been fined for native plants in gardens meant to supplement/support pollinator populations. Even then, if the plants are able to pollinate and spread before the city did anything/knew about it they would still have a continuous issue.", "Elvis is the King, what else did you think would happen?", "yeah. you don't do that. you ask him about the garden. mention that out appears to be on public land and see how he responds. you don't ask him to do anything. you don't threaten, you just ask.  and smile and nod when you leave.  but hey. if you think that turning him in for something you only suspect, that impacts you not even a little, you're probably pretty bored and you should definitely do it to stir up a little excitement! /s", "It\u2019s a fruit and vegetable garden?\n\nIt might be for the neighborhood? Like a neighborhood garden. The only way to find out is to ask. If not then you can report it. But if it is for the neighborhood then you would be a major jerk. \n\nIt is alway better to double check.", "Don't think so. I checked the local ordinance and it's illegal to plant anything in a public park.", "BTW I know it's really tout suite. I was being cutesy. But thanks for the upvote! \ud83d\ude01", "It's not that it bothers me a lot. But I've heard many other neighbors mention it at the park. I'm there almost every day. So it's more a matter of speaking up for the community. The person in question is a bit of a recluse from what I can tell.", "I wouldn't talk to him. It will only make him mad and defensive and at the very least he'll ignore you. Plus, you don't have the authority to tell him he can't have a garden in a public park. That would be the job of the parks dept. So tell them about it instead."]}
