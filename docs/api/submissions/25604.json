In this time neither of us have gone clubbing alit, due to both of us enjoying the atmosphere at bars a lot more. \n\nToday, while I was at work, She and some friends went to a music festival. They got dressed up and after I got sent a lot of pictures, by all three of them, of her cleavage and very visible boobs. I didn\u2019t want to say anything at the moment, as I didn\u2019t want to sell like an AH to her friends.\n\nLater on they got really drunk, and decided that two of them would go clubbing. I didn\u2019t get much updates other than pictures every once in a while, and started to get worried.\n\nAfter clubs started closing they both showed up at the bar I worked at, and talked and had some water. After they left, my coworker mentioned the very cleavage focused dress and asked what I thought.\nAfter getting home I also heard that they had been to the club in town most famous for lightly dressed girls and gropy guys, and told me that a lot of guys touched her. I questioned this a bit as this wasn\u2019t her normal scene. \n\nI then mentioned that I thought she was dressed a little inappropriate for the activities they were going to. The outfit was ok for a festival, but for me way to much to go clubbing in. She disagreed and thinks I\u2019m a bit of an AH for suggesting so.\nSo am I the ah?\n\nEdit: wrong punctuation\nEdit 2: typo\nEdit: Just some things to clarify.\n1: I don\u2019t call my girlfriend my girly, this was a typo, English is not my first language. \n2: I did talk to her about her day, this happened ay ah out 6 in the morning, and we went home at 3. So this was absolutely not the first thing I talked to her about.\n3. I did talk to her about the guys groping her, and tried to console her about it, again this was not the first thing I said when we got home. \n4. I am not trying to control what she wears, and love watching her in sexy clothes. I just wanted to raise my concern about feeling this was a little over the top.\n5.

Problem solved. \n\nWhy did your coworker think you should have any opinion on your girlfriend's outfits? Why do you?\n\nEdit: wow I'm getting threats in my dms now lmao. Since none of you apparently understand nuance, let me elaborate on this further: \n\nYes everyone has opinions about things. No not every opinion needs to be shared. Yes people in relationships can have opinions about their partners. No, the opinions can't be \"this is inappropriate to go clubbing in\". You can only have an opinion about propriety of your partner's wardrobe if you're going somewhere with a dress code and their current outfit does not meet those requirements; otherwise you can have a frank discussion about how your dressing sense can make the other person feel. Yes I am in a long term relationship. No my bf would never dream of telling me what was appropriate and what wasn't. Neither would my father. Yes we have had discussions about why I enjoy dressing up or dressing provocatively. No I didn't automatically feel \"oppressed\" because we talked about it. \n\nI also live in India, so if I was to avoid all places where men got particularly grabby with women I would never be able to leave my house. Furthermore, to everyone who says \"he's allowed to have an opinion\" sure. He may not have expressed it in the best way, but he's ALLOWED to hold it. And his gf and I are ALLOWED to hold the opinion that he's an asshole for his opinion. See how that works?? \n\nNow please stop with the horrible dms ffs.", "YTA\n\nYes, you can always disagree with what your partner wears, does, says. It's when you attempt to control or police those things is when you are the asshole, which is what you're trying to do now. You're telling her what she chose to wear is inappropriate. It also doesn't sound like what she was wearing was even inappropriate for a club anyway...cleavage is pretty normal. Like what specifically about it was inappropriate other than cleavage? Because cleavage sounds pretty clubbing to me - and I've never clubbed...\n\n**It's giving - she was showing cleavage so she was asking for it vibes when you talk about her going somewhere where there are gropy men.

I didn\u2019t want to say anything at the moment, as I didn\u2019t want to sell like an AH to her friends.\n\nLater on they got really drunk, and decided that two of them would go clubbing. I didn\u2019t get much updates other than pictures every once in a while, and started to get worried.\n\nAfter clubs started closing they both showed up at the bar I worked at, and talked and had some water. After they left, my coworker mentioned the very cleavage focused dress and asked what I thought.\nAfter getting home I also heard that they had been to the club in town most famous for lightly dressed girls and gropy guys, and told me that a lot of guys touched her. I questioned this a bit as this wasn\u2019t her normal scene. \n\nI then mentioned that I thought she was dressed a little inappropriate for the activities they were going to. The outfit was ok for a festival, but for me way to much to go clubbing in. She disagreed and thinks I\u2019m a bit of an AH for suggesting so.\nSo am I the ah?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you feel uncomfortable with your partner dressing that way and going to a scene that invites those types of people to give her that type of attention and touch her that way, that is a valid boundary to bring up. Controlling what she wears all the time is toxic, yes.\n\nHowever, I don't get what everyone else is saying in these comments. If you're not demanding her or yelling at her to not wear this or that or go to that place and this place, but instead bringing up your concerns and how it makes you uncomfortable, that's totally valid. That's literally just communication. A lot of people in these comments sound super toxic. Should we let our partner wear what they want to wear? Yes. However, should we also make our partner uncomfortable by our actions and disregard of their feelings towards something we do? No. If you don't like her going to these types of places and wearing those types of clothing to get that type of attention from certain types of people, then bring that up. She shouldn't be disregarding your feelings on it if y'all are in a serious relationship. Once again, for those that are seemingly jumping on others back for semantics - Going to those types of places AND dressing that type of way. If they wanna dress that type of way on a normal day in public, then whatever. If it makes you uncomfortable for either scenario then bringing it up as a concern and boundary is valid. That is a valid boundary. Forcing her to not show any skin whatsoever is toxic, but I see no one (not even OP) suggesting that.\n\nHowever, she is also not wrong to go to those types of places and let people interact with her in that way. That is her prerogative. It is also your prerogative to say that your partner doing that is a boundary and you don't want to be ina relationship with someone who does that. You both need to discuss what are hard boundaries and if neither are willing to compromise or come to a solution about these boundaries then it's time to reevaluate the relationship and possibly let go of it. \n\nNAH and yes how you dress should not be an invitation to grope someone or worse without consent but we all know that there are those types of people that take it as such, and certain clothing encourages them to SA. It sucks but that's a harsh reality that isn't going to change any time soon. Before anyone comes out saying \"mEn dOn't CaRe wHaT yOu WeAr AnD wIlL sTiLl GrOpE yOu,\" I'm literally not saying anything to the contrary. There are some disgusting and shameless dudes out there (and women as well), but going to those types of places and/while dressing a certain type of way can encourage them to do what they do, which may or may not make your partner uncomfortable.\n\nEdit:\nI can't believe some people are still attacking me in my other replies. Clothes are not an invitation but others, who are disgusting people, take it as such. Why put yourself even more in their crosshairs with something that is even more revealing (I'm talking like transparent dress or whatever) than a regular dress (short skirt, long skirt, whatever you desire is fine!!)?

It doesn\u2019t mean he is trying to control her (which he shouldn\u2019t) but communicating how he feels is his right in a honest healthy relationship. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to dress in a way that would make my husband uncomfortable. This is not me giving him control, but having respect for our relationship and his feelings. In a relationship you don\u2019t have to agree but you do have to have an understanding of what your partner is comfortable with. They may just not be compatible. Also the part about her being touched while out, let\u2019s not jump to crucifying him just yet. We don\u2019t know that he didn\u2019t show concern for her dealing with that.

Going to a notoriously gropey bar in a skimpy outfit without someone to look out for you is objectively not smart. \n\nThe fact that OPs gf was **sexually assaulted several times in the space of a few hours** clearly demonstrates this. This is not shaming, nor is it projection of insecurities, nor is it victim blaming. Nobody is trying to absolve the creeps of their blame; their disgusting behaviour does not suddenly absolve anyone of the responsibility they have to themselves to be safe and avoid dangerous situations. \n\nAgain, OP is mad that his gf was **sexually assaulted**, not just over some abstract insecurity about the way she dresses.

I believe relationships are all about making sure the other person is happy and comfortable in the relationship. So yeah, in this case you are right, the relationship is not going to work out. Because of HER, and NOT him.\n\n2. I agree, this is unhealthy.\n\nBut may I propose a third scenario that you hadn't considered?\n\n3. The girl, after hearing a second opinion from her boyfriend, realises that actually yes that outfit *is* a bit too revealing. Because she loves her boyfriend very much and wouldn't want him to feel uncomfortable at all, she decides to tone down her outfit a bit.

I don't want that 2. Its disrespectful to my bf tbh. These comments are wild and yet another example of the sexist double standards.

There is tons of social science research on perspectives of victim blaming, including society's tendency to find reasons to blame three victim for controllable items to remove themselves from the violent nature of SA. Research suggests the majority of men tend to view revealing clothing as an invitation for sexual advances. Women also seem to hold this belief, but they are generally less confident about it. None of these studies take personality into account, so there's another variable. \n\nThe entire argument that clothing makes sexual assault more likely is seemingly unfounded, considering over 78% of sexual assault cases are committed by someone who has a personal connection to the victim, such as a partner, friend or family member. Women who live in rural areas, are under age 34, and live in lower income housing are the most statistically likely to experience sexual assault. I would love to see more research into why that seems to be the case but came up short looking for reputable sources. \n\nThere is give and take in relationships, and that can vary relationship to relationship as well as person to person. I am personally someone who would never compromise on what im wearing due to my partners insecurities, and i don't expect my partner to cater to mine based on what they wear.
