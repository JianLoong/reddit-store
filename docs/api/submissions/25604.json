Unless it's meant to assist you in overcoming whatever compels you to form opinions about others' choices, including those of your significant other. \n\nWhen you're in a healthy and mature relationship with someone, it's expected that you will accept that person as they are and grow together, rather than attempting to change the person you care about just because you deem their choice of clothing as inappropriate.", "You\u2019re not trying to \u201clook good for other people\u201d, it\u2019s for yourself, and if your whole relationship is based of everything you\u2019re doing is to avoid \u201cupsetting your man\u201d, that\u2019s not a relationship, that\u2019s a dictatorship, that\u2019s oppression, it\u2019s disgustingly unhealthy", "If he can\u2019t accept the way she chooses to dress, he should leave, not try to manipulate her", "Notice how that\u2019s not even close to comparable, because there are no good arguments against what I\u2019ve said?", "When you think you\u2019re being witty, but you\u2019re actually outing yourself as an idiotic incel.", "Wears the line for one? Too much cleavage is subjective anyway. Too much cleavage may not have been too much, but that's beside the point. This is where it's a slippery slope. \n\nIt starts with the cleavage, the dress has no cleavage but a slight v, is it okay for him to demand a totally different neckline? What about the length of dress, whether she has arms out? Before you know it he is changing her style totally. Clothes are intrinsically linked to a woman's identity far more than men realise. \n\nIts also a slippery slope because it starts with the clothes and moves onto controlling other areas. Honestly, a man wanting to control what a woman wears is a red flag. His argument makes no sense anyway, the dress was ok at a festival, but not for a club..there's drink involved at both events, likelyhood of getting groped at both events as we know women get groped anywhere. The issue is that the club has a reputation for being a bit gropey. The issue isn't the dress, Its the men that think they have a right to get handsy!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Have you never lived in a town with a place with a reputation? People talk. We had a bar who would let under age teens in, wanna know how I know? My friend told me, and I went her after that, and then I told my friend. We also had a forrest where kids would go and smoke pot, and have field parties. It was called the hole. It\u2019s not uncommon to have a place known to locals as something\u2026\n\nI think I may have missed sarcasm, if so I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been a long day with a toddler and I\u2019m so tired lol.", "Are you O.P? Or a mind reader? How could you possibly know then.", "You haven't answered my question. What's detrimental about expressing your opinion?", "So why does showing your body make u feel good , ( honestly you have good points can\u2019t lie )", "Dont take it wrong, but are you braindead? XD you saying the same shit over and over again like a mantra. You really think if a woman wants to go for a family dinner naked and a man says anything that's trying to manipulate her? XD\nIm almost sure u are trolling or a really big case of whiteknighting.\nSo i guess its pointless to ask someone for an opinion, so they wont manipulate you.\nXD\nHopefully you are not a sexist and you have the same opinion on mans clothes and body. His body his choice.", "Haha what? You claiming you have a good argument without having one doesn't make it a good argument?\n\nYou're doing a classic \"I love free speech, BUT ONLY WHEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT I WANT\"\n\n\"My body my choice when it comes to these 15 things, but not these 10 things\".\n\nClearly, there's no way to have an ACTUAL argument with someone like you, since you'll just put your hands over your ears and go \"LALALLA\" whenever someone else starts making too much sense, soooo, bye.", "So true , I never realized how much our identity is linked to what we wear .. \n\nHonestly that\u2019s true like why is it okay for the festival but not the club, didn\u2019t even realize that", "If sexual harassment is based off how you act,dress and where you are then explain. Being 11 years old,wearing a hoody and jeans on the way to school... literally fully covered child walking to school and being followed and suggestions made about me taking those clothes off for him...it's the perps fault not the victim.\nJust like ops misso isn't to blame but the ppl who chose to act without control or consent.not her clothes or her location.", "Because I don\u2019t make fake excuses for manipulative men? Notice he didn\u2019t want to say anything in front of her friends? Notice it was only after the coworker validated his \u201cconcerns\u201d that he had the guts to say anything? Notice how he waited until she was home and away from anyone before he brought it up?", "Because we have to go off what\u2019s been spoken about in the post, otherwise, you\u2019re making up information to suit your narrative.", "Because the intention isn\u2019t to simply \u201cexpress\u201d, it\u2019s to use your opinion to manipulate your partner into behaving how you expect them to.

That\u2019s manipulation, that\u2019s control.", "There are plenty of reasons, generally it\u2019s because you think you look attractive in those clothes, you feel good about yourself, you like the way you look", "If you don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing, leave them, it\u2019s as simple as that, you don\u2019t have the right to tell someone how to act or what to wear, end of story", "At what point did I every say no to \u201cmy body my choice\u201d? Go ahead and find that for me", "Totally. Now if the dress was that revealing, surely it would have been inappropriate for the festival not the club.\n\nThe real issue is the groping for which we can't blame the dress for because we know a woman could be in full on snow gear and still get groped. Rather than blaming the dress, he should be asking if she is ok. If she was groped by lots of men, she may have just gone into freeze mode etc.  The club that has a rep for being a bit gropey is the issue, not the dress.", "And so are you, I don\u2019t see him saying he doesn\u2019t care or doesn\u2019t have concerns either.", "If my partner was a drunk I'd definitely express to them how I feel they should drink less. Doesn't matter if it's their body. If it becomes a big problem I'll request that they get help or I leave. Is that manipulation? It's their body isn't it?", "And you know what? If my partner didn't like my outfit I'd want them to tell me. And tell me why. Of course there's a point at which it gets ridiculous but that varies from person to person.", "Okay but personally , out of respect for my man I would not go out of my way to dress up (sexually) for an occasion where another man could approach me? Like I just don\u2019t get why girls would wear stuff like that without their man? Do they crave more attention? I\u2019m sorry I really don\u2019t understand, like yeah it would feel nice to look good but I would just feel gross seeing men staring at my body or even just the thought of another man trying to touch me I don\u2019t like it , I just would run home to my man Lol", "XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\nYeah, you know world is not black and white, its all gray? But ok i will use your \"logic\".\nIf someone wants to rape animals or kids its their choice. If you dont like it, leave them. You dont have the right to tell them its wrong.", "Well you implied it, or once again he shouldn't care if she has a gangbang?", "But why would she even go to THAT club in the first place knowing the rep it has?? Like of course you\u2019re going to a club there\u2019s gonna be weird ass men there , but honestly why should we as women have to avoid specific places just cuz men can\u2019t behave?", "He didn\u2019t once state concern for her safety, only her clothing, so we use that information to base that the clothing was his concern, not her safety, because that\u2019s what has been stated. \n\nYou don\u2019t add made up information to suit your narrative, the narrative is written around the information", "You are trying to compare something objectively harmful and and life ruining to\u2026\u2026 clothes? Lol ok", "Yes, if you don\u2019t like it, you leave, you don\u2019t get to try to control them or what they do.", "Key words \u201cI\u2019d want\u201d, she didn\u2019t want, see how that\u2019s important?", "See here\u2019s the very important point, *you* are making these choices, your man isn\u2019t directly telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be doing that, it\u2019s your choice based on your feeling, that\u2019s where it\u2019s a different situation", "Okay so I don't normally dress up but when I go on a special night out I get a real kick out of experimenting with a look, finding something different to wear and looking good. There's nothing about that that is \"disrespecting my man\". \n\nI don't want to be hit on by men or want attention, I want to enjoy feeling good about myself and the change from my usual jeans and band t-shirts into a vintage dress or some fun costume, having a laugh with my friends and getting ready together, dancing a bit and if he's not there with me, sending my partner pics of how cute I am. \n\nAnd he trusts me to remain faithful and isn't insecure or possessive, so he isn't bothered what I wear. He also knows if someone tries to touch me unwanted I have excellent self defense skills. I do check in with a text here or there so he knows I'm safe, not too drunk or anything, and when to expect me home. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with dressing how you like but there's everything wrong with monitoring your partner's clothing because \"someone else might look at them\".

Everyone in that club,including the ops friend is enabling the male behaviour and blaming the women for what they are wearing when it's the men that are the issue. There have been three women including two minors raped in the sea at a local beach near me that would have been packed with families. The location isn't the issue,what women wear isn't the issue,it's the men (no not all men before that comment gets thrown back)"]}
