If you feel uncomfortable with your partner dressing that way and going to a scene that invites those types of people to give her that type of attention and touch her that way, that is a valid boundary to bring up. Controlling what she wears all the time is toxic, yes.\n\nHowever, I don't get what everyone else is saying in these comments. If you're not demanding her or yelling at her to not wear this or that or go to that place and this place, but instead bringing up your concerns and how it makes you uncomfortable, that's totally valid. That's literally just communication. A lot of people in these comments sound super toxic. Should we let our partner wear what they want to wear? Yes. However, should we also make our partner uncomfortable by our actions and disregard of their feelings towards something we do? No. If you don't like her going to these types of places and wearing those types of clothing to get that type of attention from certain types of people, then bring that up. Once again, for those that are seemingly jumping on others back for semantics - Going to those types of places AND dressing that type of way. If they wanna dress that type of way on a normal day in public, then whatever. If it makes you uncomfortable for either scenario then bringing it up as a concern and boundary is valid. That is a valid boundary. Forcing her to not show any skin whatsoever is toxic, but I see no one (not even OP) suggesting that.\n\nHowever, she is also not wrong to go to those types of places and let people interact with her in that way. That is her prerogative. It is also your prerogative to say that your partner doing that is a boundary and you don't want to be ina relationship with someone who does that. You both need to discuss what are hard boundaries and if neither are willing to compromise or come to a solution about these boundaries then it's time to reevaluate the relationship and possibly let go of it. \n\nNAH and yes how you dress should not be an invitation to grope someone or worse without consent but we all know that there are those types of people that take it as such. It sucks but that's a harsh reality that isn't going to change any time soon. Before anyone comes out saying \"mEn dOn't CaRe wHaT yOu WeAr AnD wIlL sTiLl GrOpE yOu,\" I'm literally not saying anything to the contrary.

You didn't even tell us what exactly is bothering you, which is part of the reason people say it's controlling, it comes across as a power move.\n\nIf it's about the grabbing, just ask her, it's about trust.

NTA, you expressed your opinion, but you didn't exactly ban the dress or want to be in a position of control. every healthy relationship is also based on compromises that do not put each other in an uncomfortable position. the comment \"your body, your decision\" is not always true, because your partner's opinion must also mean something to you, thats why you have a partner, right?

It doesn\u2019t mean he is trying to control her (which he shouldn\u2019t) but communicating how he feels is his right in a honest healthy relationship. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want to dress in a way that would make my husband uncomfortable. This is not me giving him control, but having respect for our relationship and his feelings. In a relationship you don\u2019t have to agree but you do have to have an understanding of what your partner is comfortable with. They may just not be compatible. Also the part about her being touched while out, let\u2019s not jump to crucifying him just yet. We don\u2019t know that he didn\u2019t show concern for her dealing with that.

Yes, we all know the way you dress shouldn't be an invitation but it is for a lot of people in this world, and someone being uncomfortable with their partner inviting that type of attention from those types of people (by going to those types of places AND dressing that type of way, for those who live for semantics) is a very valid boundary.

I'm literally not saying anything to the contrary. There are some disgusting and shameless dudes out there, but going to those types of places and dressing a certain type of way is literally inviting them to do what they do, which may or may not make your partner uncomfortable.

I'm probably the chillest person to have around and never raise my voice ever, let alone get physical. that doesn't mean I'm going to be a docile carpet you can stomp on. I respectfully convey my preference and boundaries. if you don't agree then we're not compatible and that's the end of that.", "you don't get to decide what's a boundary and what's not. the individual in question does. just like woman can have boundaries like don't go dancing with other woman because it makes me uncomfortable. and that's completely valid too.", "Feel free to look up the definition of DV...", "In this situation is better to break up with that person than try to control theirs outfit, yes. \n\nBut for me this kind of attitude in men is toxic.

But these kind of women would be more compatible with OP.", "It literally is victim blaming to say she knew what was going to happen after she was sexually assaulted.", "Of course there needs to be communication, I don\u2019t believe that people should just drop a relationship because of that without even talking about it.

Don't date women who dress like that if it bothers you in the first place.

Thats how relationships work.\n\n>And no one has to accept an attempt at controlling their outfits as acceptable within the bounds of a relationship. In fact, with most women I know, the very attempt would be a dealbreaker.\n\nAs above. Doesn't make you an asshole for having standards that generally won't impact someone's wellbeing (like my gf expecting me to not look homeless outside of the house).\n\nMy point is overall, expressing that you don't like how your partner dresses absolutely does not make you an asshole. Pretty normal behavior.", "Basic human decency is such a terminally online reddit take lmao amirite", "The only opinion my girlfriend ever has on how I dress is when she tells me I'm beautiful and vice versa.

Yes sure, the groping men are the main perpetrators - still there's at least some responsibility with the woman putting herself into this. I mean, I'm not going into the next ghetto with a million dollar in my pockets either... but ofc it is alway easier to just push responsibilites unto others...", "And how does that manifest itself for men?

That's what the post is about, and it's a thing that happens regularly. That does not mean that the other commenter does not know or believe that men get sexually assaulted at clubs, too.\n\n>Do I need to spell it out any further? \n\nNo, but you're free to calm down.\n\n>And I certainly wouldn\u2019t let myself be groped!\n\nJesus Christ, that's not how that works. \"I wouldn't let myself be sexually assaulted\" okay good for you queen, I guess all these other gals just \"let\" men treat them like shit and step over their boundaries, invading their personal space and traumatising them!!

Absolutely fucking not.", "Noooo, you're saying that \n\"WOMEN are blamed for the behaviour of men when they dress provocatively\", \nand then proceed to explain \n\"if you dress provocatively REGARDLESS of sex you will get unwanted attention\".\nBut then just in your previous comment you were explaining how your husband gets touched when going shirtless. \n\nSo effectively you're saying that the comment your were replying to should say: \"Women get blamed for the attitude and behaviours of both men and women.\" \nThat about right?\n\nAnd yes, definitely agree with your point, if a car is left unlocked and gets robbed, it's not the owner's fault, the owner wasn't asking for to be robbed. And yes, the owner could be more careful. But as you said, it is a risk. If the owner of a car is in the process of robbing a bank and needs a way for a quick getaway, but the car was actually stole because he/she left it unlocked - would it be the same message?\nSo forgive me, but I cannot say OP's girlfriend should be more careful. Could, if she wanted to, but also could build in preventative measures, like walking a protective 7ft hungry brown bear on a leash. No one would likely want to grope her with that in her hand, however much skin she's showing. \nShe could learn martial arts and break the gropy man's finger. \nShe could keep a pepper spray in her bag.\nBut no one has the right to say for definite she should be more careful, other than perhaps her mom.", "it's just semantics at this point.", "So the appropriate response would have been to ask how multiple cases of SA made her feel?

No, I highly doubt she wanted it and the boyfriend should have asked her if she was ok instead going on about something as simple as what she was wearing.

If someone lets you think they value that then acts differently, that is, like anything of that nature, a real problem you're going to have.\n\nKinda seems obvious to me.\n\nNow I'd think you could have a conversation about it first, because people do lots of things for lots of reasons that aren't always a reflection of their behaviour most of the time. But still.", "A boundary would be, \"I don't want to be told what to wear.\" Not, \"I don't like what you're wearing/doing.\" Controlling someone else's actions/choices is not a boundary. A boundary is a line you draw for yourself, not for others. It only applies to other people when they do something *to* you that violates that boundary.\n\nFor example: \"I don't want to share passwords\" could be a boundary. If your partner sneaks a peek at your passwords because they think they should know your passwords, that is them violating your boundary. But their preference, \"I want to know your passwords,\" isn't a boundary, because that violates your autonomy.", "If he got with this girl and from the get-go she wore revealing outfits then I think OP would be a fuckin idiot for trying to change her style.\n\nBut new clubbing behaviors that make him uncomfortable and new clothing patterns that make him uncomfortable suddenly popping up over a year into a relationship should be talked about if it makes him feel uncomfortable, everybody in this thread is just invalidating his feelings.\n\nIt's more complicated when it's someone you already love and new things like this come up, and I think expressing your issues with it to see if theres any will to  compromise is actually much healthier than just instantly breaking up.", "Okay whatever. If you want to go put yourself in dangerous situations then have fun", "Oh we completely agree then lol, maybe there are some people in this thread saying she's a bad person for it but OP just said he feels it's inappropriate, I don't think he's an AH for that but everybody else seems to.", "No, the world just isnt as black and white.

Have for years. Haven't ever had any less male attention as a result of it - whether I'm single or not. I'm good looking irrespective of whether I'm showing skin, and people seem to want to get to know me just as much, if not even more, when I'm not showing it. So, I'm really interested in precisely why it matters to you what someone wears out and about, because my experience is that it doesn't change the way third parties interact with me at all. \n\nThe only thing that matters is that I'm not interested if I'm in a relationship, and what I'm wearing has absolutely no bearing on that.\n\nNow if your question is simply that you don't want to be with someone who dresses in a particular way, that's fine.
