It was child free except for my 18 month old son.\nAfter the ceremony/ formal photos, I noticed the photographer taking a lot of photos of my son. It was sweet and I didn\u2019t think much of it but it prompted me to have a polite word with the photographer to ask that he not use any of the close ups of my son for promotional purposes.\nThe photographer was really defensive and said that the bride had signed his T&Cs which allows him to use any photos he likes on his social media pages, website, flyers etc so if I have an issue to take it up with her.\nI didn\u2019t think I was asking anything unreasonable so I clarified that I didn\u2019t mind the large group photos but that we\u2019re just not comfortable with him using the close ups or the ones of him on his own, and that I appreciate the couple signed the paperwork but this is a minor who cannot consent and as his parent, I do not.\nThe photographer still wouldn\u2019t agree so I then asked him to not photograph my child for the remainder of the day and he shrugged and said \u201csorry, no can do.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t set out to be difficult but he rubbed me up the wrong way so for the rest of the event I made sure to always place myself between the photographer and my son to prevent him getting more pics. It was a bit awkward at times having to shift my position mid conversation but I didn\u2019t make a scene or do anything inappropriate for the photos, in fact nobody even knew what I was doing and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to trouble the bride and groom over it during their big day\u2026\nIt was only after the fact when my SIL got the photos back that she asked me what was going on. Instead of focusing on other guests, the photographer had in fact continued trying to photograph my son and the result is a huge number of photos with my back turned.\n\nSIL is annoyed I\u2019ve inadvertently blocked other guests and she\u2019s disappointed she doesn\u2019t have any photos of her dancing with her nephew.\nI do get why she\u2019s upset but I explained what had occurred and why I had done it and she said that I was being unreasonable, uncooperative and that in this day and age it\u2019s inevitable my son will have a social media presence so it wasn\u2019t worth ruining her photos over. \n\nWorth noting that much to the annoyance of our families, we have a strict no social media rule when it comes to our son, for various reasons that I won\u2019t go into for word count\u2019s sake, but the bitterness over this probably exacerbated this issue\u2026\n\nI think I might be TA as the family have said I should\u2019ve brought this up in advance so they could\u2019ve ironed out the details with the photographer beforehand and they aren\u2019t wrong, if I had thought of it beforehand then I absolutely would have, but it truly never even crossed my mind before the day. We\u2019ve not been to a wedding in years and this is the first formal event we\u2019ve ever taken our son to, so it wasn\u2019t until we were in the moment that I thought of it.

Should the photographer want to use a photo of your son, and if he did so without your permission, you could have put a stop to it fairly easily in the courts.    \nThe photographer was the AH for continuing to focus on your son in photos.", "I'm BAFFLED!  WTF was wrong with the photographer?!  All he had to do was say, \"okay\".\n\nHe did not do HIS JOB.  This is not on you!  He was unprofessional and cocky!!!\n\nUnreal!", "NTA and you know the photographer already has pictures of your son on his socials. I'd be finding a lawyer to send him a nice letter informing that he really doesn't have permission to use pictures of your son.", "NTA - It\u2019s really weird that the photographer kept following you and tried to photograph your son. It wasn\u2019t you that prevented him from getting phots of the rest of the family, it was his fault for laser-focusing on an infant. And it also wasn\u2019t your fault that there weren\u2019t any photos of SIL dancing with her nephew, as you said at first you were fine with group shots, you didn\u2019t say no photographs at all until he pushed the issue and wouldn\u2019t listen to reason.\n\nHonestly, you did amazing by protecting your son that day, and did so very gracefully. Do you know if the photographer was independent or worked for a company? He acted very unprofessionally, so I think it\u2019d be reasonable to get in touch with his employer/leave your honest review for his conduct.", "Put this creep on blast so he can move on to his next career.", "NTA. I am a wedding photographer. I generally have a philosophy of not posting photos of anyone not immediately in the wedding party or minors to social media, and I generally ask the couple beforehand for this very reason. You can\u2019t get a release from every guest and you have no idea what is happening in their personal lives. That fact that you actually expressed your concern to the photographer and he pursued is outrageous and super unprofessional. Like why the heck would you continue this charade and not just agree to not use it for promos? That\u2019s stupid.", "NTA. But the photographer is and honestly that is who the bride should yell at.", "NTA. Your sister isn't authorized to give consent for the photographer to use photos of your child on public platforms.", "NTA\n\nThis photographer sucks.  The professional way to resolve this would have been to respect your wishes and focus on the other guests, speak to the bride/groom about the situation, or both.  Continuing to try and take photos of an uncooperative guest who stated they didn't want to be photographed further was just stupid, and that's what ruined your SIL's photos.  \n\nIf my wedding photographer did this, I would be livid.  With the photographer.  If I request photos that are proving difficult to get, come talk to me so I can help resolve it.  If one guest isn't cooperating, get good shots of other guests instead.  It's perfectly common for photographers to approach the bride and groom throughout the evening to get specific shots, but this person chose to enter into a battle of wills with you instead of communicating the issue to the bride.  Super weird and unprofessional.\n\nSure, there are things you could have done if you had thought of them, but you didn't and it wasn't your job.  It was this guy's job, and he didn't do it.", "NTA. You didn't ask him to not take photos of your child, just to not use them as promotional content. The right way to handle this (for him) would have been to say, \"I completely understand! Are you comfortable with me still taking photos of him by himself or with other guests or would you prefer me to focus elsewhere?\". He made this into an issue by hyper-focusing on your son and was completely unprofessional in the way he talked to you/acted afterwords. \n\nSIL should be upset with the photographer, not you.

The photographer is the one that your family should be mad at, not you", "NTA. What \"details\" does the photographer have to know in advance? You made a very clear and easy to fulfill request... And it's ridiculous to act like one person (bride or not) can sign away permission for him to use everyone's photos. Forget the issue of minors giving consent, none of the adults except the bride were given the opportunity to consent (or not) either!", "NTA. \n\nIf photographer posts any pics of your son he has to take them down.", "NTA.\n\nThe photographer did a shitty job by trying to get photos of a pretty child for his own purposes instead of doing the actual wedding photography he was hired to do.\n\nYou told him to stay away from your kid. He had the rest of the wedding to photograph.", "NTA. I don't think your requests were unreasonable, and it does sound like the photog got butthurt in a \"nobody tells me what to do!\" kind of way, so he tried to get more photos of your kid out of spite. Which means he deliberately did a bad job and upset his actual client. Completely unprofessional.", "NTA. I think its great youre protecting your son from being posted online. Its probably true that he will eventually have his own social media, but hes too young to understand the weight of social media right now and the consequences of his pictures being up like that. Plus, you never know what weirdos are gonna do with your kids pictures.", "NTA: this *photographer* is the A-H and unprofessional at that. They need to amend their T&C\u2019s because OP is correct, the person who hires the photographer can\u2019t consent to others being used in promotional material. \n\nAnd- to waste the reception trying to take more photos of OPs baby even though they\u2019d been asked to? Sounds like they were concentrating on being petty rather than their actual job (to shoot the wedding). \n\nAnd the family being upset OP didn\u2019t bring it up before? It wasn\u2019t an issue until the wedding day itself. Was OP supposed to stomp up to the bride and make it an issue? No- OP did the right thing by going straight to the photographer.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA. You protected your kid from a creep. Good job, mom.", "NTA\n\nThe photographer was the problem here and should have agreed to a reasonable request. I don't know your situation, but it doesn't matter, there are legitimate child protection issued with some kids that make this important and he has no idea if those apply or not. They should have respected your wishes and made a note to keep those photos private/not use them in marketing then continued as normal; if the photos aren't good because of the photographer playing silly buggers I'd be taking that up with them if I was the bride/groom.\n\n(FWIW I personally put photos of my kids on social media quite often, and don't see why you wouldn't if there weren't specific reasons, but that's your choice as a parent)\n\nActually the more I think about this the more I think I'd contact the company to complain anyway (if it is a company not a sole trader)", "Oh HELL NO!!!\n\nNTA!\n\nIf this person has a site I would leave some scathing reviews about him.  Specifically,  his REFUSAL to accept personal privacy and his apparent need to use unauthorized photos for his own personal gain.", "Nta \nThat unprofessional freaks camera should have been thrown in the nearest pond. He was told no, end of conversion.\n\nPersonally I think you should take it further legally and blast him on social media too", "Nta. The photographer  was unprofessional.  If he was snapping poor pictures of you and your son, the SIL needs to address this with him. You could also leave a review of his professionalism.", "NTA, the photographer was extremely disrespectful and HE ruined the photos, not you. You had a reasonable request that he should have respected and it would not have been an issue. If he uses photos of your son, you need to not only report them and have them removed, but then write negative reviews to warn others of his behavior. I wouldn\u2019t do that unless he does, as he could retaliate and post photos.", "NTA. The photographer was deliberately ignoring your reasonable request - that makes him an AH. And so is the family for not understanding a simple concept - your child, your choice.", "NTA", "NTA, also, I would contact a lawyer to see if you have any legal recourse to prevent the photographer from using your sons images on his web site or anywhere else. Your SIL may have consented to HER photos being used, but I doubt very much that she can consent for your underage child who she does not have any legal guardianship over.", "NTA. Maybe you could have mentioned it before hand, but the photographer should have consented after you asked him. It seems like he made it his personal mission to follow you around just to spite you. Your SIL shouldn\u2019t be upset with you, she should be upset with the photographer. I normally don\u2019t like leaving bad reviews on Google/social media, especially for small business owners, but this was completely unprofessional.", "NTA", "You definitely should have explained this to your sister so she could talk to the photographer beforehand, especially since you have said it\u2019s an ongoing issue . Other than that it\u2019s fine not to want your child on social media. I can also understand why your sister is upset at having some photos not come out great. But the real villain is the photographer, he sounds like a complete AH. He should of just taken the photos as usual and not posted ones with close ups of your son. Had he not made you concerned with his comments you wouldn\u2019t have needed to \u201cruin\u201d photos. Continuing to try and photograph a child when you have been asked not to by a parent is deranged.", "INFO how many guests were at the wedding?  Just wanting to clarify if the photographer was actually stalking your and your son or if it was a small wedding where statistically it was just likely that you'd be in a higher number of pics?   Not sure of the laws where you are but here in the midwest US the photographer can't publish the photos without a specific model release for each person in the photo.    \n\n\nI can see that your SIL is disappointed having her photos ruined though it wasn't your fault.", "NTA\n\nI do have to say that unless the bride put up a sign saying photos are permitted and useable ala a film shoot, the photographer cannot use photos of a minor without your consent. \n\nThat said, I do find the no social media of my kids folks to be annoying at events. My brother did this for awhile and it drove the whole family nuts.", "NTA. That photographer is unprofessional to ignore the permission of the child's guardian.", "I would be blasting this photographer on social media for targetting your son after you asked him not to.\n\nPredatory behaviour.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Firstly, you have the right to protect your child's privacy. NOT just the right, the responsibility. He cannot protect his own. That said, the photographer is unprofessional and creepy af. He should have respected your wishes. And the fact that he went out of his way to try and take more photos of your son after that just seems like he was trying to antagonize you. If I were your SIL, I'd be upset with the photographer and demand a partial refund since he wasted so much of his time photographing your back being petty instead of providing actual decent photos of other guests/wedding festivities during that time. He knew what he was doing. The photographer ruined the photos, not you.", "ESH.  Your no photos policy seems pretty extreme. Not that you can't do it, but what a giant pain in the ass in situations like this one.  You SIL is an AH for pretending all her wedding photos were ruined.  Photographer is the biggest AH here for insisting on continuing to photograph your son.  He was a AH for disregarding your request, and an AH for being so obsessed with having his way about getting photos of your son that he seems to have missed getting some photos that were important to the bride.", "Idk I'm kinda feeling ESH.  The photographer was def an ah, but u cldve said something to like ur MIL to have them help run interference.  That way u wldn't be bothering the bride and groom. \n\nI have to ask did they make an exception for ur son with regards to the child free issue?  And if they did was it bc u asked them to?  Bc if that's the case I can kinda see where they wld be put out, since in their eyes u already had special treatment.  This wld add an extra layer of annoyance for them.  \n\nAnd while I don't think ur SIL shld be mad (except at the photographer) I can kinda see why she wld be annoyed.  This for her was, hopefully, a one time event that she wanted, and prob paid a lot for, nice pics of.

That\u2019s not being unreasonable in this day and age, and I can\u2019t even fathom the gall of people who would try to interfere in a parent\u2019s prerogative in that regard.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt isn't your fault that your SIL hired a shitty photographer.  I would be watching social media and reporting any photos of my child to whatever service to be taken down.", "NTA. That photographer ruined her pictures. Instead of getting what he was hired to do he instead chose to be stubborn about posting your son on SM? I\u2019d post a review.", "NTA, the AH here is the photographer that failed in his job, tell SIL to demand her money back for his failure to photograph the wedding like he was hired to do.", "NTA, the photographer is the one who purposefully took bad pictures in order to get back at you, or whatever he was trying to do.", "NTA. You should check this photographer\u2019s website and socials, because he may have used your son\u2019s pictures already. If he does, contact him and insist that he take them down. Next step is a lawyer\u2019s letter. This is really not at all cool. And while you\u2019re on his socials, be sure to leave reviews explaining exactly how he behaved.", "NTA. I may be way off base here but the photographer \u2018s behavior here seems very odd . Why he didn\u2019t he ask you first ? It seems majorly suspect that he said no . I would assume most of professional photographers would usually respect people \u2018s  wishes on not be photographed and especially parents who do not wish their children to be photographed. \nYour sister in law should be concerned , not mad about getting her not perfect wedding pictures .If your instincts is telling you that something is off about this photographer , then you may be right . \nI would ask this photographer first to see if he could at least he could do is blurred your son\u2019s face if he going to post his picture on his business page . He has to be really stupid to ignore your request to have your son\u2019s face blurred  , it is bad for business and makes him look very suspicious  if he says no . If he says no,  I would consult with a lawyer and also minimize your contact with your sister in law, she clearly prioritize her stupid precious wedding photos and not the safety of your son . Sorry if that sounds harsh but if  I had my sister in law do that me , I would not trust her at all .", "NTA. If I were the sister, I\u2019d petty and write a bad review on the photographer, stating he took lots of low quality photos of the guests, with their backs turned. That all the pictures looked the same. Not be mad at you for not giving consent for pictures of your child.", "NTA. Why was the photographer so focused on your young son? Why did he try to get the kid in so many photos? \n\nAs for your family, minors should not be on social media. There are far too many people willing to steal even the most innocuous photos to exploit a child.  You, as the parent, are acting in the best interest of YOUR child.\n\nNTA.", "NTA OP.  At the very least, the photographer should have offered to pixelate your child\u2019s face in any posts promoting the business.  I would recommend consulting with an attorney to see if you might have any legal options.", "I would ask SIL point-blank if she instructed the photographer to focus on your son. NTA.", "YTA. Why are you the exception to all of the rules?  You have a \u201cstrict no social media rule when it comes to (your) son\u201d?   That\u2019s all well and good, completely your choice. But the fact that you had the only child at the wedding, you didn\u2019t bring up your \u2018no social media\u2019 rule prior to the wedding and had a negative effect on the wedding photos say that you\u2019re a difficult person to be around.", "This happens more than you would think. The photographer at my sister's wedding apparently really liked taking pictures of one pregnant guest at the reception( nearly 25% were of her/ included her).", "IAAL and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.", "I was thinking the same thing", "It depends on the country. In Germany there is a minimum group size above which it is considered a group shot in public in places like a performance or wedding or party etc. I think it's more than 5 people in the shot, not certain. Below that the individuals permission is necessary for publishing.", "That's something to go to court for in regards to payment!", "I'll drink this koolaid with you - I can't imagine a normal professional event photographer playing paparazzi like this after being asked to not photograph someone. Especially if the person in question was a child.", "Damn, I bet you are exactly right.\n\nI was going to say what photographer creeps on a BABY, but I think you nailed this.", "From my admittedly limited reaserch on German law, it appears to post pictures of a minor, you need parental/guardian consent. I'm in the us. For a company to publicly use a childs image, they need parental consent as well.", "Didn't go to court, but she sure as hell warned other couples off using him.", "\"I am not a lawyer\"", " Which means he deliberately did a bad job and upset his actual client. Completely unprofessional.", "A business is all about the reviews!  A business can be destroyed that way.", "Seriously, that is strange he was so pushy. I can understand the he can't guarantee that the little boy won't be in any pictures (which op wasn't asking for), but Ops request seemed logical enough to me, so to not even try to honor it is sketchy....", "Even so - taking photos of the child would be understandable until parent asked photog to stop - it's really creepy that they persisted.", "Or for their \u201cprivate use\u201d or for trafficking.", "Sure, there are things you could have done if you had thought of them, but you didn't and it wasn't your job. It was this guy's job, and he didn't do it."]}
