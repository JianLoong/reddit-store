I\u2019m very sensitive to sounds due to certain issues of my own. I would likely struggle hearing the sounds, but I would choose to leave myself if they were distressing me. My issue is not your issue.", "NAH I have misophonia and if I'm in public and a stranger triggers it I remove myself from the situation as best as I can because it's not theor fault. I was also diagnosed with PTSD many years ago and I have worked my butt off to deal with my triggers but if something does start to set them off, you know what I do? I remove myself from the situation and deal with them because the world does not revolve around me or my mental health.\n\nI'm so sorry you had this happen to you.", "NTA, you're not responsible for her issues. I have misophonia. Your noises would get to me, but that's why I always have earphones as it's not your problem but mine", "Nta. I have autism and auditory triggers are absolutely a thing. Sitting next to you would be a nightmare. That said; it\u2019s my problem, because like how I can\u2019t control what sets me off, you can\u2019t control a tic. It\u2019s my job to go \u201cright, this is upsetting. Time to leave.\u201d\n\nAnnoying? Yeah. But that\u2019s life, sometimes shit happens that inconveniences us.", "NTA; I somewhat empathise with her, trauma can be triggered in the strangest of ways  but the answer was for her to move quietly or put in headphones or the myriad of other coping mechanisms' that exist  not to then cause you trauma \\[because Ableism and other forms of oppression are traumatic, especially over a period of time\\].", "NTA- she is working in a public place. A coffee shop. She should brought have headphones.  \n\nI hope you enjoyed your time with your friend!", "[removed]", "But these days people often use the word triggered to describe something they don't like which isn't a medical condition.  Someone with this issue should have earphones or earplugs anyways.", "Anything can trigger ptsd. Don\u2019t insinuate she\u2019s lying.", "His tics are NEUROLOGICAL not mental, he literally cannot control or manage them. Do you tell other people with brain damage or disabilities to just *manage* them?", "THIS woman was rude. Not every woman.", "DifficultSpecifi is a bot, comment copying bots don't have PTSD.", "I have horrible misophonia and would never dare berate a stranger just for existing in a public space. You either put up with it, put earbuds in, or leave.", "He has a disability. Do you routinely tell people with disabilities to leave a public place because they\u2019re making people uncomfortable? Or do you just understand that they have as much right to be out living their life as you do?", "You would be surprised about that. Somebody once tried to physically push me down me a set of stairs because I was \"making too much noise\" just walking the central stairs of our apartment building.\n\nLiterally, the person tought that just my steps, at 10h am and outside their apartment, were too much loud to him to sleep and tried to push me in a fit of rage.\n\nPeople are crazyyyy...", "Because you\u2019re not an asshole :-)", "Wow. That's some bullshit. I assume canes for visual impairment or maybe for mobility reasons? Either way, people typically don't just have those for kicks.", "I wonder if OP is currently working on coping skills for tics. I had an anxiety based tic and OCD and have them under control with hard work. I would not be able to stomach the types of noises OP makes. That's a lot to subject other paying customers to. However, I'd remove myself respectfully. That goes both ways. I don't see how one is more or less important than the other. ESH.", "He said his tics are neurological, not mental. They are the result of something not right in the brain structurally. No amount of hard work will likely ever make them go away. That\u2019s like telling a stroke victim or accident victim to just heal themselves with hard work. It doesn\u2019t work like that.", "But this is neurological, not anxiety. It's possible that maybe it can be improved, but that would probably take medications rather than therapy since it's a physical issue rather than emotional. And honestly given the side effects and copays, medication might not be an option. I'd have to leave a place to escape those sounds too, that doesn't mean OP is at fault.", "She actually asked OP to leave the building, not just sit somewhere else.", "YTA How come it just happens to be that all your \"ticks\" are se*sual sounds and you do it when seated next to strange women ? Are you a predator that is faking a disease in order to get away with being a per*ert ?", "NTA - Keren was being ableist as fuck", "NTA.", "NTA, there are such things as headphones to block out noises you don\u2019t want to hear in a public place.", "NTA A coffee shop is not her office. You have every right to be there, you know, drinking coffee... in a coffee shop... with friends... \n\nYou were kind enough to offer an explanation (you were not obliged to divulge anything to her). If it triggered her, that's a HER problem, not a you problem, she's the one who needs to get help in dealing with her PTSD or seek pout places that don't run the risk of triggering her. The world doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA your tics would trigger me a LOT, i have sensory processing disorder and misophonia, its on ME to remove MYSELF from that situation\n\nSame goes for this woman, you have the right to exist in public aswell", "Other peoples triggers are not yours to manage. If they are triggered by things they may encounter in public they should seek therapy for coping mechanisms.", "nta", "NAH \n\nsounds like both you are her a suffering in different ways. \n\nthe only solution was for one of you to leave. \n\nI don't think either of you did anything wrong.", ":( NTA but thats a shame. I would have tried to be accomodating and understanding. But I'm british lol", "No NTA", "NTA.  To be honest, for me, it would be hell to be near you. I also know that it's my problem, and even if I internally would grouch, I would never blame you. I would remove myself or find another place further away.", "NTA", ">Would she ask a blind person to leave with their guide dog because she's allergic?\n\nYou know that is actually valid? Not for minor allergies, but certainly for life-threatening ones. Because allergic people have a right to live and work, too. \n\nMutually incompatible disabilities are the one valid reason why you do sometimes have to refuse someone an otherwise reasonable accommodation, and the decision for whose needs take precedence is often decided on who was there first.", "It's a busy cafe with nowhere you could move to to sit and she's camped there to work!? NTA", "Ikr? No matter how much it affected her. She's discriminating against something OP has no control over", "I agree. The sort of sounds your tics make would trigger me too. But that\u2019s my issue to deal with. I have earplugs on hand for this reason, and if it was still bothering me, I\u2019d move. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to not be able to enjoy yourself in public because of something you have no control over.", "that reminds me of the blind youtuber who got told not to look at a woman at a gym he was doing his routine before the woman entered", "It's not bizarre. Mild allergy, sure suck it up. Major allergy, sorry you guys both have valid disabilities and unfortunately have mutually incompatible needs - one of you cannot be here.", "I happen to know one person who actually did this with a guide dog for a blind person and it's my own mother. I have never wished more for the earth to open up and swallow me whole.", "I did intend it for like a very minor allergy in which the choice is out of comfort. But that is a conundrum you pose.", "This.\nCan\u2019t say I agree with the NAH assessment.\nThe lady asking OP to leave was being an asshole and could have left herself.\nShe was the only with the issue.", "If it was misophonia yes but most people with PTSD that could be triggered by these tics wouldn\u2019t expect them in that environment.  You can\u2019t walk around with everything you need to cope with a major trigger all the time or isolate all the time.  It sounds like she was able to work just fine until someone started making sucking and licking noises next to her which I can absolutely see triggering SA-induced PTSD. \n\nNAH. OP can\u2019t help the noises and I don\u2019t think the woman could help needing to avoid. It makes sense she\u2019d ask to get to stay if she was there first and working but she didn\u2019t throw a fit or call names\u2026to me it sounds like she was pretty polite if she was actually experiencing ptsd issues from the noises.  \n\nI hope OP continues to go out, know that sometimes youll butt up against conflicting disabilities, but keep on keeping on.", "Yes. She was choosing to work in a CAFE. I'd have been ok if she was in a Library, cos you don't expect those sounds there. But in a cafe you have to expect a certain level of disabled peeps visiting with carers, nasty old men and screaming babies. It's a CAFE. lol.", "She chose to sit and work in public, she can\u2019t really demand the public to not be there. And disabled people are just as much part of our society and therefore the public as anyone else. \nShe could\u2019ve brought headphones, btw. That\u2019s what I do when I\u2019m in public and don\u2019t feel like being exposed to too much noise.", "IT IS A PUBLIC PLACE GOD FORBID PEOPLE BE DISABLED IN PUBLIC", "It's very different being allergic to just not liking a noise. Allergies can be bad (swollen eyes, sneezing fits, migraines), set off asthma, and even cause death. Noise is just an annoyance. But still, I'd vacate for the person with the dog.", "If you are that sensitive to sounds, you need to have earplugs when you go out in public.  The world doesn't revolve around this person, and this sounds like extremely entitled behavior.", "My intent was a mild allergy, an inconvenience. Not like a severe nut allergy.", "There is a neurological condition called Misophonia where some sounds cause intense rage and/or disgust.  But yes, to some extent is up to the person with Misophonia to have preventative measures rather than everyone else catering to them."]}
