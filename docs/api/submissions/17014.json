Not anyone's fault, but it's totally understandable how those sounds could be triggering to someone who has PTSD. She cannot control her triggers and you cannot control your tics. They are equally no one's fault and equally a medical issue. One of you had to vacate the area in order to avoid continued conflict, and she did. Only thing is she could've been less rude about it.", "NTA.  It's her responsibility to remove herself from triggering situations, not the other way around.  Her demanding that you leave reeks of entitlement.", "NTA. Both of my teenage daughters have been diagnosed with and are on medicine for Tourette\u2019s. I wouldn\u2019t have been as kind as you. The correct thing to do was for her to remove herself if she was truly being triggered. But I can guarantee you that she did not believe you when you said you couldn\u2019t control your tics.

But you don\u2019t know how far she is in her journey. It takes YEARS to develop those coping skills.", "It certainly does. No dismissing the time and effort that takes. But that still doesn't allow them to demand others to comport themselves in a certain way so long as others are being baseline respectful.", "Sure, that is fair and true. But regardless  I still wouldn\u2019t even say the chick was a AH. She didn\u2019t snap off, she asked them to move. And offered alternatives to sitting in the shop. Was it her \u201cplace\u201d? No. What she the politest person about it? Probably not, but with trauma I can overlook it. But it was a ask. OP answered. Which is why I lean to NAH. If she demanded and snapped off, that would be a different story.", "To be clear, I wasn't really saying she was being an AH per se, just somewhat unreasonable. I don't think it's her place to ask. If you recognize you are having an issue you move yourself to avoid it in a public space. This would be different, say, in a ticketed event where you can't just move to different seats. Then you can politely ask before then speaking to the event staff to allow you to move."]}
