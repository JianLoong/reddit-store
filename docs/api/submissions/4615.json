This also happpened for my daughters 6th birthday in which i let them go to their moms home because i didnt want her to be alone for her birthday. well this year my fiance suggested spending the day with the kids and i thought it would be a good idea. They like her and its a good chance to bond with her even more so why not?\n\nFrom what ive heard the kids enjoyed it however my ex is really angry. She called me an asshole because she thinks the kids should have spent the day with her and not my fiance. She blew up t me and said a lot of rude things about me and my fiance.

There are going to be so many more times where for one reason or another your time with the kids may be interrupted.

This also happpened for my daughters 6th birthday in which i let them go to their moms home because i didnt want her to be alone for her birthday. well this year my fiance suggested spending the day with the kids and i thought it would be a good idea. They like her and its a good chance to bond with her even more so why not?\n\nFrom what ive heard the kids enjoyed it however my ex is really angry. She called me an asshole because she thinks the kids should have spent the day with her and not my fiance. She blew up t me and said a lot of rude things about me and my fiance. I think she is being unreasonable because it was the kids time with ME so i get to decide what to do not her\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I at least think she should have been brought into the conversation. \n\nAnd yes, I recognize I mentioned nothing about what the kid wanted. Nothing in the original story mentioned it either.

It's very easy not to know what's going on when the ex isn't communicating with you and refuses to communicate or communicate properly when you try.
