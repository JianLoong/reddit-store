This also happpened for my daughters 6th birthday in which i let them go to their moms home because i didnt want her to be alone for her birthday. well this year my fiance suggested spending the day with the kids and i thought it would be a good idea. They like her and its a good chance to bond with her even more so why not?\n\nFrom what ive heard the kids enjoyed it however my ex is really angry. She called me an asshole because she thinks the kids should have spent the day with her and not my fiance. She blew up t me and said a lot of rude things about me and my fiance.

There are going to be so many more times where for one reason or another your time with the kids may be interrupted.

This also happpened for my daughters 6th birthday in which i let them go to their moms home because i didnt want her to be alone for her birthday. well this year my fiance suggested spending the day with the kids and i thought it would be a good idea. They like her and its a good chance to bond with her even more so why not?\n\nFrom what ive heard the kids enjoyed it however my ex is really angry. She called me an asshole because she thinks the kids should have spent the day with her and not my fiance. She blew up t me and said a lot of rude things about me and my fiance. I think she is being unreasonable because it was the kids time with ME so i get to decide what to do not her\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most jobs don\u2019t allow you to say no to travel, even if you\u2019ve been there 20 years. For most people the client dictates when your travel. You have a great plan if you\u2019re going to retire or demote to a job that isn\u2019t important, once you\u2019ve saved enough to raise children. It\u2019s just not how life works most of the time. \nI only hope you\u2019ll be the parent you think you\u2019ll be, that doesn\u2019t miss anything ever. Good luck with that!"]}
