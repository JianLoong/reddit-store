I gained custody of my brother (16m) and had to quit my job to accommodate his schedule. I had to move to a bigger apartment in a much pricier area so my brother could finish out high school at his same school. I have scholarships as a source of income and my mom had life insurance, so I\u2019m mostly fine financially as long as I budget carefully, but I can\u2019t afford any extras. \n\nBefore my family moved to the city we live in now, we lived in a very rural area where my mom owned our house. After we moved out, she rented it out for extra money. The same family has lived in the home for over five years now and they have paid $800 per month in rent. They have been amazing and always fix any issues by themselves. My mom never had any complaints about them.  \n\nNow that I have inherited the place, all of my family members who still live in the area have suggested that I raise the rent to $1000. Market value for a property of that size/condition in the area would be at least $1600. I feel extremely bad because I\u2019ve always been on the other side of things, but my mom could afford to charge way less than market and I just can\u2019t. \n\nI gave the tenant three months notice, and he is basically refusing to pay, and only sending me the $800 every month. My grandma took over communication at this point and insisted he not only pay the $1000 going forward, but that he pay the $200 he was short for every month he was supposed to send the new amount and didn\u2019t.

You didn't evict the long-term tenants, you just increased the rent but still kept it well under market value. In your place, I think I would have raised the rent in smaller increments, but you own the home and it is your right. \n\nKeep in mind, though, that peace of mind and tenants that take care of issues by themselves are worth a LOT more than getting market rate for a property.", "Do they have a current lease at the same rate? You can't raise there rent until they are signing a renewal and that would be effective after the last month of current lease.", "NTA.\n\nIt's tricky to get good tenants. It's unfortunate when they become bad tenants.\n\nThey probably think a 20% rise in rent is unreasonable. \nIt's actually not a 20% rise. it's less than a 4% rise per year over their tenancy with compound interest and it's well below market value.\n\nYou're offering them a very generous deal assuming your family are correct about the local rental values.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable charging $1600, when your new tenants have paid $1600 per month for 3 or 6 months without trashing the place or being a nightmare in other ways, you can thank them for being good tenants and lower their rent to $1200 to make you feel better if you like.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable being a landlord / rentier sell the place to one, some or all of your local family and they can deal with the thing.", "INFO: Are you legally allowed to raise the rent at this point under the lease and/or whatever local laws apply?", "NTA as long as they didn\u2019t have a current, preexisting lease that was still in effect. We had a similar situation happen back when we were renting. We had the same rent for 8 years, but with rising property tax they had to raise our rent. They also gave us 3 months to decide whether to move or pay the extra cost.", "NTA but I suspect that you will find that you have less money,  not more,  when you begin paying for the things the stellar tenant has been doing and have a harder time than you expect finding a tenant that is reliable and takes good care of the property", "We have a couple of rental properties, and I can\u2019t bring myself to raise the rent to the crazy market value here. We have good tenants. They\u2019ve been there several years, no trouble, always pay on time. But I have raised the rent some. We\u2019re still below market value.\n\nThat said, your mom\u2019s tenants going that long without a rent increase, especially in the last few years, have had it way too good and they should know that and be grateful. An increase of $200 a month is totally reasonable.\n\nI think if I were you, I\u2019d hire a local property manager to handle everything with the tenants so you never have to deal with them. You\u2019re 19 and in mourning. You have big, difficult stuff to handle. You do need the hassle of them. The rental agent should have a lease she could present to them and ask them to sign. If they refuse, she\u2019ll know the laws in that state about evicting tenants, and if you go that route, she will handle it.\n\nWhen the existing tenants are out, she will suggest how much you should get in rent in that market, advertise for renters, run credit checks on them and suggest who she thinks would make the best tenants.\n\nOur property manager gets 10% of the total rent and is well worth it.", ">They have been amazing and always fix any issues by themselves. \n\nNTA, but be prepared for that arrangement to come to an end - either by getting a new tenant or the current tenant agreeing to the new lease. Routine maintenance can become very expensive very quickly. Got a deal on rent ourselves, and took care of a carpenter ant infestation and a grounding (outlet, not whole house!) issue in our new place, as well as patching a hole in the shed roof. All considered, pros would have charged about $1-1.5k for those alone.", "NTA - Deepest condolences, OP. \nFirst off, $800 rent is basically unheard of in 2023 \u2014 and even $1000 is wayyy under market value most places. Don\u2019t feel guilty whatsoever about doing whatever you need to do in order to get through this incredibly difficult time\u2014and beyond. Rooting for you and your brother <3", "NAH but if they fix everything themselves you should realize that right there is worth the $200 a month, because fixing things is extremely expensive", "You\u2019re young and in a tough spot so I don\u2019t wanna call you an AH despite being very anti-landlord. Get a lawyer involved I can basically guarantee that since your mom didn\u2019t have a lease you\u2019re going to have a hard time with this situation.", "Is this legal? I thought rent could only be i creas according to inflation, however I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from and what are the laws there. I\u2019m sorry about your loss, and the situation you were left at. In my opinion YTA, because 200 is a lot for a rent increase (maybe even ilegal).", "NTA. You\u2019re running a business.  Not a charity. The benefitted for a long time. They should be grateful.  Or you can just sell the house and be done with it.", "NTA. Inflation is squeezing us all. It's not like you're Blackrock. You own one property. My property tax/home insurance has skyrocketed by $150 extra a month. They're always welcome to find another place but you're basically saving them $600 a month. They should be thankful you're not outright charging them $1600 most landlords would charge them.", "Is there a lease? If so, you can't just arbitrarily raise the rent unless it is included in the lease. If there is no lease, you need to get one ASAP. If the tenants won't sign a lease, you will have to move forward in the eviction process or accept what they are paying. You really need a valid, legal lease. This sounds like it will turn into a headache. Evicting people will probably result in them trashing the house and you will have to sue them for damages if they don't have a security deposit and/or the deposit doesn't cover damages. I own several rental properties and this is a nightmare scenario.", "NTA .  You become a landlord for the profit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think bringing it up to 1000$ a month so you can support your brother as he gets through school is a AH move.\nSadly sometimes people are saddled with big responsibilities and have to make decisions that are best for them even if it makes others angry. \n\nSorry for your loss. This is a lot for someone so young to take on.", "NTA it\u2019s your place and you make the rules", "NTA. \n\nBUT, the tenants will also be NTA when all of the things they normally fix themselves become a you problem. And this is a farm house. I am certain they can find more than $200/month in repairs you need to be taking care of. I certainly would be making sure you\u2019re fixing every little issue you are supposed to be dealing with as landlord.", "The rules on that vary from place to place. The tenants could be month to month, meaning 3 months notice is plenty. \n\nI know where I live most rentals are rent controlled and you're not legally allowed to increase the rent more than x% annually (changes year to year) unless you get permission from the Landlord Tenant Board. 800 to 1000 is like 10x the usual allowable increase. But I know people who lived in other places where there are no regulations, and have seen rents increase to nearly double (which is a dick move).  \n\nIt's DEFINITELY something OP should look into. Perhaps the tenant is refusing cause there is some regulation that OP isn't aware of that this increase violates.", "This is important. Tenants have rights despite landlords often acting like they don't. You're not above the law.", "My mom was a lawyer so I have no idea why, but there was never an actual lease agreement in place. The tenant did request one after I gave them notice so I drafted one with the new price and sent it for them to sign, which they aren\u2019t doing. I live in Florida and to my knowledge, it is legal for me to raise the rent this much.", "Nah, Florida is basically month to month without a prior lease agreement. The tenants requested a lease, and got one. They don't get to not sign the lease and thats a hack. They are still subject to the raise in rent, because it can be changed month to month. Lease would be advisable cause it sets the rent at an agreed amount for a specific time period.\n\nAlso 3 months notice was more than OP needed to give. 15 days is all that's needed for month to month tenants to be evicted.", "Even with the increase it would still be $600 under market value. I doubt raising the rent by $200 is illegal in a rural area. Normally I wouldn't side with the landlord, but this is an exception for me. \n\nAn AH would evict them and rent it for market value. \n\nNTA.", "> there was never an actual lease agreement in place. \n\nThat could be a problem. You need to talk to a lawyer.", "Alot of states default to month to month in absence of a lease. If you gave notice and they suddenly wanted a lease, they are trying to cover their tracks. If they don't sign the lease it's not a hack to screw over the landlord, your original notice still stands unless they sign it.\n \nIf they had no lease, you were completely in your rights to raise rent when drawing up the new lease.\n\nReddit and the internet hate landlords right now though. So just ignore them.", "I hadn\u2019t seen a state mentioned thanks", "Not an asshole, but you may have walked in guns blazing a little too hot. First of all speak to a lawyer to see if what you did is even legal. \n\nIf not legal, see if he can meet with you and do your best to gain a little sympathy. Say you\u2019re sorry but you\u2019re new to all this and explain you need to support your brother with that money. Explain you had no idea what the laws were since you\u2019re only 19 and you haven\u2019t been able to think straight. Say you appreciate that they\u2019ve been good tenants and you want to start a fresh slate with them. Say that unfortunately, 800 isn\u2019t an option considering how you have literally no other way to support your brother, so the option is either raise his rent or for you and your brother to live there, but you would highly prefer for it to not reach that point. This may not be true obviously, but one way to kick out tenants legally is if the owner is moving back in so he wouldn\u2019t really have any grounds to fight with that. Show him what the market rate is, and say that if you are forced to move back, then that means he\u2019s going to be paying a shit ton more regardless so you would highly prefer to work together to come up with a fair price.", "Your increase was super high why not just increase it by 50 usd a month for a year", "NTA\n\n \n\nYou can't afford to charge him $800. You decided to just break-even or approach it. You're not gouging him.", "YTA. get a real job. landlord.", "NTA, he is paying half the value of the rental property.  Time to evict him and get someone that will pay the full $1,600.  Even if he does say he will pay the amount do not trust him."]}
