You\u2019re 19 and in mourning. You have big, difficult stuff to handle. You do need the hassle of them. The rental agent should have a lease she could present to them and ask them to sign. If they refuse, she\u2019ll know the laws in that state about evicting tenants, and if you go that route, she will handle it.\n\nWhen the existing tenants are out, she will suggest how much you should get in rent in that market, advertise for renters, run credit checks on them and suggest who she thinks would make the best tenants.\n\nOur property manager gets 10% of the total rent and is well worth it.", ">They have been amazing and always fix any issues by themselves. \n\nNTA, but be prepared for that arrangement to come to an end - either by getting a new tenant or the current tenant agreeing to the new lease.
