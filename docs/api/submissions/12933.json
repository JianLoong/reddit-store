He can make his own breakfast.", "NTA but FYI, when I was on maternity leave and breastfeeding AND my husband was working horrific shifts... he still got up with me with both babies.  He would get the baby (actually he insisted the bassinet be on his side of the bed too) and change her and get her ready and hand her to me to feed and then lay back down.  We both were in it together because we were both the parents.  And we didn't snipe and get into \"well I did this\" because we both knew we were in the trenches together.  You guys need a little more of that because right now, instead of brewing coffee, all that's brewing is resentment and it's going to set off louder than the tea kettle ever could.  This is more than just breakfast here, but setting the foundations of your future together and I hope you guys recalibrate, reset expectations and open up communications or you're in for a hell of a rollercoaster ride.", "I don\u2019t understand why his breakfast is your responsibility. He did it by himself before, right? You\u2019re home to take care of the baby AND recover from pregnancy and childbirth. As someone else pointed out, maybe he should be making you breakfast. \n\nThere are some things either or both of you could make in advance for breakfast like a casserole, quiche, overnight oats, etc. or just make extra for dinner and have leftovers. Or eat cereal. Breakfast doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal. \n\nThis is a tricky time for families. Newborns disrupt routines and you\u2019re both adjusting to new roles. He may need a reminder that maternity leave isn\u2019t a time warp to 1955 where the woman does everything for the household.

You shouldn\u2019t put up with his butthurt demands", "While I agree she is NTA. Alternating isn't always possible for multiple reasons. I didn't produce enough milk to pump and breastfeed, so we stored the extra milk in case of an emergency. Getting upset about breakfast not being made for him kinda sucks but people have bad days and get upset about dumb stuff all the time.", "If anything, he gets up first and makes himself breakfast, why is he not also making breakfast for OP??  And since he wakes up when the baby cries anyways, there is no reason he can't get up with the baby sometimes for overnight feedings since OP pumps.  \n\nJust because OP is on maternity leave does not mean the husband has zero obligations to help with the baby.", "Half passed father, husband and adult. Does this AH have no hands or something that he's incapable of making his own breakfast?"]}
