{"id": 2179, "submission_id": "ytpegg", "title": "WIBTA for not forgiving my dad for putting my cat up for adoption while I was in the hospital?", "selftext": "I (29f) had a medical emergency a few years ago that put me in the hospital for about a month. During that time, my dad (70m) went into my apartment to get me clothes and things. When I got home, he told me that he had put my cat up for adoption with the humane society. \n\nHe said that he couldnt take care of her, and I was obviously not able to while I was hospitalized, so he had no other option. In my mind, he did have options - he could have visited every week and left her with food and clean litter, or he could have pet sat her at his house until I got out (he lives with his girlfriend in a very large house 45 minutes away - they have one small dog and I'm not sure how it fares with other animals, but I don't see how it would be impossible to keep the cat apart, in the basement or something). \n\nI feel that was a heartless thing for him to do. I have no idea whether she was adopted or euthanized, and the thought of her suffering is still painful. I dont want to forgive him for doing it... Yet I wonder if I'm overreacting. It was an incredibly hard and emotional time for him to see me in the hospital and he was scared and worried for me. Plus he paid a few thousands of dollars for my out of pocket expenses plus my rent for that month so I have to be grateful for that. And if he had never gone into my apartment at all my cat would have probably starved. So I don't know if it's right for me to have expected him to do more. One part of me says: it's just a cat, I'm sure it can adapt to any scenario and be just fine. But another part of me loved her very much and feels so much guilt and pain for not doing better for her.\n\nI've rarely spoken to him since then and when I do I often explode with anger. Am I right to still be mad at my elderly father or am I an asshole?\n\nEDIT - INFO:\nMy dad came to see me twice when I was in the hospital and he never mentioned my cat but he did tell me that he was \"taking care of everything\" in my apartment. \n\nI was let out of the hospital about a month later and my dad met me there to give me my keys back. He got me a taxi to my home, then he and a friend of his left to his cottage up north. When I got home and noticed my cat was gone I called him and was perhaps a little hysterical as I was also distressed that he had left while I was still weak and on a lot of medication. It wasnt a pleasent conversation - but he texted me later telling me that he had taken her to the Humane Society. However I didn't think to ask him if they had given him any paperwork that could help me identify her, and when I called they had trouble tracking her down - another complication is that my dad could never remember my cats name or how old she was, and he might have given them the wrong information. I also searched online and couldn't find her picture in any of the listings. I followed up with my dad and he told me he didn't have any information for me as he was on vacation, and at that point I was in pretty bad shape mentally and didn't have a lot of physical and emotional strength to know what to do. I know now that I should have asked my dad what date and time he took her there so they could have narrowed down the records.", "created_utc": 1668306364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytpegg/wibta_for_not_forgiving_my_dad_for_putting_my_cat/", "score": 1059, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They were staying at her house temporarily while we figured out our apartment.it still makes me a mad and that was 11 yrs ago.", "You have every right to be upset with your father. Realistically, he could have exercised other options before putting your cat up for adoption. I'm sure during that time he was stressed and concerned about your health, so a quick fix was easier for him than a true solution. If your health allowed you the ability to be alert and sentient, he could have worked with you instead of taking it upon himself to decide on your behalf. Ultimately, that was your cat, and life is not replaceable like a car or a plate would be. I urge you to not guilty for how what happened came to be because it seems like it was completely out of your hands, there was nothing you could have done. \n\nIt's important that you're grateful for the things he did help you with. Have you ever spoken with him about this beyond the time that it happened? You don't have to forgive anyone for anything. However, it takes a lot of work to hold a grudge with someone, especially if you want a relationship with them. If you haven't spoken about it since it happened, I urge you to talk with him with humility and address what you're grateful for, but explain how this still sticks with you. If you've already spoken to him and he refused an apology, I don't think you'd be an asshole for not forgiving him.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know if I could ever fully forgive a family member if they did that to my cat. \n\nCan you check with the Humane Society? Maybe your cat is still up for adoption.", "If pets are disposable things then this is something easy to get over. If they\u2019re a life long (theirs) commitment who becomes family, you\u2019re NTA for not forgiving him. \n\nDid he even take the amount of time it took to pack up the cat to consider any other options or did he just say, f this, and dump her? This was an incredibly cruel thing to do and completely unnecessary. The fact that he didn\u2019t just let her die in your apartment is not reason to forgive what he did. \n\nIf anyone feels like downvoting, that\u2019s fine. I can die on this hill.\n\nEdit: I am thrilled to see we\u2019ve amassed such an army for this battle. With such a dedicated band of soldiers I think we can take the hill and win the war. Again once again, Dad SUCKS.", "NTA. I would never be able to forgive someone for leaving my cat at a shelter.", "NTA. What a callous, horrific thing for him to do. Even if he couldn't have cared for the cat himself, there must have been other people who could have fostered the poor thing. I'm so sorry that you came home from a terrible health battle only to find that your companion had been tossed aside. I'm sure she would have been a comfort to you while you were healing.", "Nta. Its understandable.  They are family.", "Nta. Cats practically take care of themselves. They just need food, water, and a clean litter box once a week.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't understand why you didn't go to the shelter and see if 1) the cat was adopted or 2) if they had info on who adopted it.

I find that hard to believe especially when you take into consideration cats are a lot more independent than dogs are. \n\nI have a so many questions:\n\nWhat kind of cat did you have?\nWhat kind of dog does your dad have?\nWhat would your father do if you had children that needed care? \n\n\nNTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t forgive anybody that would put an innocent animal in danger.", "NTA. Oh wow. This is the most heartbreaking post I've ever read on here. You are not overreacting. I could never forgive someone for giving my cat away.  Never.  That's horrid. He could have done so many other things instead.  I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "I'm horrified reading this.  That person would be dead to me without a second thought.  NTA.", "NTA - loss of a pet can be a huge emotional blow and particularly in the situation.  It would probably have been very healing for you to come home to your cat, so it was a very shortsighted action on your dads part.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem like your father was doing this from a malicious standpoint, he may have been overwhelmed and thought this was a way to make sure the cat was cared for.   Perhaps viewing it as a bad mistake would make it possible to find forgiveness.\n\nIt might be possible to find out if your cat was adopted, and if not reunited at least know it had a good home.", "ESH. Id say NTA but you said \"its just a cat\" IT IS A LIVING THING WITH FEELINGS. Cats are complex creatures too and all that poor little cat knows is one day you didnt come home and then some guy took him somewhere else never to see you again.\n\nYour dad definately had other options! Find a friend to take care of her, find a cat hotel, Something!\n\nInstead day 1 he said \"by the way i sent your cat away idk what happened to him im a lazy asshole\"\n\nI would NEVER forgive him for that", "NAH. Sounds as if your father did a tremendous amount physically and financially for you while you were laid up. Sounds like you are aware he also suffered emotionally over your illness. I think you owe him a debt of gratitude. He stepped up for you in a major way, a way many parents would not or could not; and while his choices might not have been your choices, he made a responsible choice for your pet cat. He did his best. \n\nOf course you have every right to be unhappy about the fate of your pet cat, but it does sound as if caring for your pet was beyond your father's threshold of responsibility. Apparently there were no other friends or relatives of yours available. What your father did is ultimately pretty responsible. He could have abandoned your cat, he could have just turned it out. He took it to a humane shelter. \n\nOf course you will grieve losing your cat. I would also suspect that your medical emergency may have some lingering effects, both physical and emotional. I suggest you get some therapy for your anger and grief. I don't think taking it out on your father is appropriate. Now it's up to you to do your best to recover.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Even if he couldn't take care of her, he should have said so, and you could have asked around if a friend could do it or something.

We figured out how to make sure my cats and this stinkbeast would be safe around each other. And we let it sleep in our beds because he missed my MIL.

I cuddled the smelly thing, I scratched his ears, and I found time to walk him even though I was spending hours every day at the hospital. \n\nDo you know why we did those things?

I am sorry, but I can't take care of you but here is a nice residence I will not remember as soon as I dropped you off. You want me to visit you?

The offender (OP's dad in this case) is probably able to sleep at night feeling he did what he could handle at the time. What's done is done, and we can't ever take back what we did in the past. By choosing not to forgive someone, you are letting that pain resurface every day. It consumes a part of your mind and has a hold over you. I can't very well judge what actually happened, because I wasn't there and we only have one side of the story. But the question was \"WIBTA if I don't forgive my dad?\" and I think she very much would be the asshole - to herself - if she doesn't forgive her dad.

They also microchip their animals and would have a log of where the animal went and could let her know the cat is safe and with another family without disclosing other information. I know from experience because I volunteer and also transport animals to new homes and/or foster homes.", "Pets give unconditional love. Humans can give unconditional love but more often than not struggle to. Doesn't matter if the person is a parent, it doesn't automatically make them a good parent.

If he was already dropping thousands to keep OP healthy, it seems really weird to not even just hire someone to take care of the cat at that point. \n\nI hope for OPs sake cat is living somewhere safe and healthy, but there's no definite answer here. The best thing OP can do is get answers from dad.", "for all we know, she was doped up on morphine for most of the time. We have no idea of what her hospital stay was like or what her mental facilities were at the time. That doesn't make her an irresponsible pet owner.\n\nShe's not an asshole for hoping her father would take care of her cat for a fucking month.", "Is this how people rationalise saving animals over human lives? No wonder there's so much hunger and poverty but  let's have an uproar over a cat. Poor dad did all this and this is what he gets. Lol.", "70 isn't too old to be able to clean out a litter box once a week or so, and fill some bowls with food and water.  Your dad gave away one of your family members without a word.  He didn't even tell you. He was so heartless, he let you go home alone, still weak and sick from the hospital, and only then find out your cat was gone. I don't blame you for still being angry. I know I would be. Definitely NTA.", "NTA for not forgiving him for getting rid of your cat.\n\nYou're also NTA for resenting the fact that he only visited you in the hospital twice when you were in for an entire month. Nor for him just dropping you off and leaving for vacation when you needed him most.\n\nYour dad sounds like a piece of work and you should go NC with him for your own mental health.", "NTA. He should have talked to yoy. You might have had another friend or family member who wouldn\u2019t have minded fostering her. You may have been able to find a foster independently to help. Etc. he shouldn\u2019t have done that without talking to you first", "INFO: Was there anyone else you would have trusted to take care of the cat? Or was your dad expected to take care of it? Are there boarding kennels in your area that take cats for a decent price?\n\nEither way, he's TA for putting your cat up for adoption without even discussing it with you. I'm just wondering if there were other options that you would have communicated if your dad hadn't jumped the gun, or if he was just expected to take care of the cat?\n\nETA: NTA, your dad didn't even warn you. He just dumped you at home and let you find out for yourself and made no effort to help when you were distressed. Your dad fucking sucks.", "Omg NTA x1000.  My heart is breaking for you. I would never forgive my dad if he did this to me. My pets are like my children. I couldn\u2019t imagine losing them and not knowing what happened to them.", "I'm so sorry that this happened. I was in the hospital for 6 weeks a couple years ago. Luckily, my husband was able to take care of our cats, but I'll never forget how excited they were to see me when I came home.\n\nI'm not surprised that you are still angry with your father about this. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like it would help to talk to him about this. I hope you can find a way to move past this.\n\nNTA", "NTA but your dad is. It was a kind gesture to throw some money at you to help smooth things over, but holy hell is he lacking in all empathy ?!?! My family would never do this. I\u2019d never do this. No one with an ounce of common sense and a shred of empathy would drop off someone\u2019s cat, not tell them, drop them at their house medicated and blow them off when they ask for more info. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this. You dad is not a good person.", "NTA. Get yourself physically to the shelter and actually look. You might get lucky and the cat still be there, even if he's not on the website. Honestly I'd file a police report for theft of the animal and splash their picture all over town and social media asking for the cat back and explaining the theft and illegal surrender to the shelter. It was NOT a voluntary surrender and you can get the cat back.  What your father did was NOT ok and I'd be furious with him for it, esp if there was a high chance of recovery for you. That cat just needed someone to take ten min out of their day and refill water/food dishes and clean the litter.\n\nCall up all local shelters, vet offices and animal hospitals and leave a description of your cat and it's chip number and explain the situation. Visit them and hang a poster of your cat up with the words stolen. You might get lucky and get your cat back, or at least find out what happened to it. You get a bigger and better response for offering a reward for it's return.

I was washing his face and beard daily with baking soda water, which helped a bit, but the smell is still there. Also, he's a total lunatic about getting cleaned, so it's a whole violent ordeal every time.
