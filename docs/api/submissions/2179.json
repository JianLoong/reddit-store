During that time, my dad (70m) went into my apartment to get me clothes and things. When I got home, he told me that he had put my cat up for adoption with the humane society. \n\nHe said that he couldnt take care of her, and I was obviously not able to while I was hospitalized, so he had no other option. In my mind, he did have options - he could have visited every week and left her with food and clean litter, or he could have pet sat her at his house until I got out (he lives with his girlfriend in a very large house 45 minutes away - they have one small dog and I'm not sure how it fares with other animals, but I don't see how it would be impossible to keep the cat apart, in the basement or something). \n\nI feel that was a heartless thing for him to do. I have no idea whether she was adopted or euthanized, and the thought of her suffering is still painful. I dont want to forgive him for doing it... Yet I wonder if I'm overreacting. It was an incredibly hard and emotional time for him to see me in the hospital and he was scared and worried for me. Plus he paid a few thousands of dollars for my out of pocket expenses plus my rent for that month so I have to be grateful for that. And if he had never gone into my apartment at all my cat would have probably starved. So I don't know if it's right for me to have expected him to do more. One part of me says: it's just a cat, I'm sure it can adapt to any scenario and be just fine. But another part of me loved her very much and feels so much guilt and pain for not doing better for her.\n\nI've rarely spoken to him since then and when I do I often explode with anger. Am I right to still be mad at my elderly father or am I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1668306364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytpegg/wibta_for_not_forgiving_my_dad_for_putting_my_cat/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Didn't tell me about it or talk it over just went and did it. They were staying at her house temporarily while we figured out our apartment.it still makes me a mad and that was 11 yrs ago.", "You have every right to be upset with your father. Realistically, he could have exercised other options before putting your cat up for adoption. I'm sure during that time he was stressed and concerned about your health, so a quick fix was easier for him than a true solution. If your health allowed you the ability to be alert and sentient, he could have worked with you instead of taking it upon himself to decide on your behalf. Ultimately, that was your cat, and life is not replaceable like a car or a plate would be. I urge you to not guilty for how what happened came to be because it seems like it was completely out of your hands, there was nothing you could have done. \n\nIt's important that you're grateful for the things he did help you with. Have you ever spoken with him about this beyond the time that it happened? You don't have to forgive anyone for anything. However, it takes a lot of work to hold a grudge with someone, especially if you want a relationship with them. If you haven't spoken about it since it happened, I urge you to talk with him with humility and address what you're grateful for, but explain how this still sticks with you. If you've already spoken to him and he refused an apology, I don't think you'd be an asshole for not forgiving him.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know if I could ever fully forgive a family member if they did that to my cat. \n\nCan you check with the Humane Society? Maybe your cat is still up for adoption.", "If pets are disposable things then this is something easy to get over. If they\u2019re a life long (theirs) commitment who becomes family, you\u2019re NTA for not forgiving him. \n\nDid he even take the amount of time it took to pack up the cat to consider any other options or did he just say, f this, and dump her? This was an incredibly cruel thing to do and completely unnecessary. The fact that he didn\u2019t just let her die in your apartment is not reason to forgive what he did. \n\nIf anyone feels like downvoting, that\u2019s fine. I can die on this hill.", "NTA. I would never be able to forgive someone for leaving my cat at a shelter.", "NTA. What a callous, horrific thing for him to do. Even if he couldn't have cared for the cat himself, there must have been other people who could have fostered the poor thing. I'm so sorry that you came home from a terrible health battle only to find that your companion had been tossed aside. I'm sure she would have been a comfort to you while you were healing.", "Nta. Its understandable.  They are family.", "Nta. Cats practically take care of themselves. They just need food, water, and a clean litter box once a week.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't understand why you didn't go to the shelter and see if 1) the cat was adopted or 2) if they had info on who adopted it. I would have called or visited every shelter. \n\nI agree that it's awful he didn't find other options, but I think you need to realize he doesn't see pets the same way you do.", "NTA", "Nta!!!", "He can take care of a dog but not a cat? I find that hard to believe especially when you take into consideration cats are a lot more independent than dogs are. \n\nI have a so many questions:\n\nWhat kind of cat did you have?\nWhat kind of dog does your dad have?\nWhat would your father do if you had children that needed care? \n\n\nNTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t forgive anybody that would put an innocent animal in danger.", "NTA. Oh wow. This is the most heartbreaking post I've ever read on here. You are not overreacting. I could never forgive someone for giving my cat away.  Never.  That's horrid. He could have done so many other things instead.  I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "I'm horrified reading this.  That person would be dead to me without a second thought.  NTA.", "NTA - loss of a pet can be a huge emotional blow and particularly in the situation.  It would probably have been very healing for you to come home to your cat, so it was a very shortsighted action on your dads part.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem like your father was doing this from a malicious standpoint, he may have been overwhelmed and thought this was a way to make sure the cat was cared for.   Perhaps viewing it as a bad mistake would make it possible to find forgiveness.\n\nIt might be possible to find out if your cat was adopted, and if not reunited at least know it had a good home.", "ESH. Id say NTA but you said \"its just a cat\" IT IS A LIVING THING WITH FEELINGS. Cats are complex creatures too and all that poor little cat knows is one day you didnt come home and then some guy took him somewhere else never to see you again.\n\nYour dad definately had other options! Find a friend to take care of her, find a cat hotel, Something!\n\nInstead day 1 he said \"by the way i sent your cat away idk what happened to him im a lazy asshole\"\n\nI would NEVER forgive him for that", "NAH. Sounds as if your father did a tremendous amount physically and financially for you while you were laid up. Sounds like you are aware he also suffered emotionally over your illness. I think you owe him a debt of gratitude. He stepped up for you in a major way, a way many parents would not or could not; and while his choices might not have been your choices, he made a responsible choice for your pet cat. He did his best. \n\nOf course you have every right to be unhappy about the fate of your pet cat, but it does sound as if caring for your pet was beyond your father's threshold of responsibility. Apparently there were no other friends or relatives of yours available. What your father did is ultimately pretty responsible. He could have abandoned your cat, he could have just turned it out. He took it to a humane shelter. \n\nOf course you will grieve losing your cat. I would also suspect that your medical emergency may have some lingering effects, both physical and emotional. I suggest you get some therapy for your anger and grief. I don't think taking it out on your father is appropriate. Now it's up to you to do your best to recover.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Maybe he had a reason for not doing so. Maybe it never occurred to him. I can't imagine the pain of coming home and finding her gone forever. Did you check the shelter to see if you could get her back? Maybe she was still there unless it's a high kill shelter. I don't think you have alot of choice in this. He's your dad and he stepped up in every other way. The past cannot be undone. Get some grief and anger counselling to help you work through this and find your way back to your dad.", "If someone kidnapped my pet without consulting me and did something unspeakable like this to them- something that could literally have killed then- I would cut that person off forever. NTA", "NTA is your cat still at the shelter up for adoption? I\u2019m not sure if you could report them as stolen ? Sadly pets are considered property in most places. In my area adult cats are not going quickly but small dogs are. It\u2019s competitive to get one but the shelter is full of large dogs and adult cats.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019d do the same thing. But how long were you in the hospital?? Have you contacted the humane society to get her back??", "Where I live it's illegal to not check on a pet at minimum every 24 hours. Leaving the cat alone for a week is not safe. What if she knocked over her water bowl, or jumped off somewhere high, landed wrong and broke a leg, or ran out of food.  Cat's organs start to fail after just a day of not eating. \n\nAnyway, giving away the cat without a word is such a dick move. Even if he couldn't take care of her, he should have said so, and you could have asked around if a friend could do it or something. But I also wonder if you asked after your cat during the month you were in the hospital, or did he lie that the cat's fine when you asked? \n\nDid he tell you where specifically he gave the cat. I don't believe anywhere would put down a well behaved pet cat, and older cats generally have a bit longer until they get adopted. Call the place he took the cat, see if you can get her back.", "NTA.  Now that being said, emergencies are unexpected events. If you don't have a contingency plan for pets and such that is on you. I am single with no children and in good health (f48) but I have proxies in place. My bestie is in charge of my celebration of life party, for example. Could your dad have done better? Yes, but I'm not judging him in that moment because YOU were his priority. Some of our multiple life lessons come from a single event. Please forgive your dad. Have a friend inquire into your cat's last known status but also can lie to you if they need to.", "Did you call the shelter? If she\u2019s still available you should be able to get her back.", "> sons dad\n\nStory checks out.", "NTA. \n\nYou won\u2019t die alone here.", "You know, this is really bothering me - especially because it reminds me so much of my own past few months, but from the other side.\n\nMy MIL got suddenly, terribly sick a couple of months ago. I had to pick her up off the floor and rush her to emergency twice, with a total of more than a month in hospital. (She's nearly back to herself now - thanks for the concern \ud83d\ude0a).\n\nShe has a stinky little mutt that I hate. It's annoyingly clingy and barks at every damn thing. I love dogs, but *not* that one. It's literally the worst dog I've met. You know what I did after making sure she was stable at the hospital? I picked up her dog and brought it to my house. We figured out how to make sure my cats and this stinkbeast would be safe around each other. And we let it sleep in our beds because he missed my MIL. I also stirred homemade broth into his food because he was so upset he wasn't eating otherwise. I cuddled the smelly thing, I scratched his ears, and I found time to walk him even though I was spending hours every day at the hospital. \n\nDo you know why we did those things? Because we aren't shitty people, and we understand how not to make a bad situation worse for someone who is already suffering in the hospital. What your dad did makes me so damn mad. So. Damn. Mad.", "I was wondering this myself. But then I realized she was in the hospital for a month. So chances are that's pretty sick. Even if it was a psychiatric issue, she probably isn't coming out in great shape. And there are usually medications that take awhile to adjust to with that severe of a physical or mental illness. \n\nSo she might not have been physically able to really follow up on it immeadiately after she was discharged. \nAnd her father isn't going to help her or support that. \n\nAnd if her father brought it in as a stray, I don't know how searchable the records would be after a couple months when she might have been able to pursue it on her own. \n\nShe would probably need to know the actual day he brought her cat in. So she could have tried but not been successful. \n\nObviously the cat wasn't chipped. Because then they should have called Op. \n\nIf the cat was chipped she should have been able to follow up on that pretty much at any time.", "He is the father of her son and nothing more to her?
