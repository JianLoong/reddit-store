During that time, my dad (70m) went into my apartment to get me clothes and things. When I got home, he told me that he had put my cat up for adoption with the humane society. \n\nHe said that he couldnt take care of her, and I was obviously not able to while I was hospitalized, so he had no other option. In my mind, he did have options - he could have visited every week and left her with food and clean litter, or he could have pet sat her at his house until I got out (he lives with his girlfriend in a very large house 45 minutes away - they have one small dog and I'm not sure how it fares with other animals, but I don't see how it would be impossible to keep the cat apart, in the basement or something). \n\nI feel that was a heartless thing for him to do. I have no idea whether she was adopted or euthanized, and the thought of her suffering is still painful. I dont want to forgive him for doing it... Yet I wonder if I'm overreacting. It was an incredibly hard and emotional time for him to see me in the hospital and he was scared and worried for me. Plus he paid a few thousands of dollars for my out of pocket expenses plus my rent for that month so I have to be grateful for that. And if he had never gone into my apartment at all my cat would have probably starved. So I don't know if it's right for me to have expected him to do more. One part of me says: it's just a cat, I'm sure it can adapt to any scenario and be just fine. But another part of me loved her very much and feels so much guilt and pain for not doing better for her.\n\nI've rarely spoken to him since then and when I do I often explode with anger. Am I right to still be mad at my elderly father or am I an asshole?\n\nEDIT - INFO:\nMy dad came to see me twice when I was in the hospital and he never mentioned my cat but he did tell me that he was \"taking care of everything\" in my apartment. \n\nI was let out of the hospital about a month later and my dad met me there to give me my keys back. He got me a taxi to my home, then he and a friend of his left to his cottage up north. When I got home and noticed my cat was gone I called him and was perhaps a little hysterical as I was also distressed that he had left while I was still weak and on a lot of medication. It wasnt a pleasent conversation - but he texted me later telling me that he had taken her to the Humane Society. However I didn't think to ask him if they had given him any paperwork that could help me identify her, and when I called they had trouble tracking her down - another complication is that my dad could never remember my cats name or how old she was, and he might have given them the wrong information. I also searched online and couldn't find her picture in any of the listings. I followed up with my dad and he told me he didn't have any information for me as he was on vacation, and at that point I was in pretty bad shape mentally and didn't have a lot of physical and emotional strength to know what to do. I know now that I should have asked my dad what date and time he took her there so they could have narrowed down the records.", "created_utc": 1668306364, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytpegg/wibta_for_not_forgiving_my_dad_for_putting_my_cat/", "score": 815, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Didn't tell me about it or talk it over just went and did it. They were staying at her house temporarily while we figured out our apartment.it still makes me a mad and that was 11 yrs ago.", "You have every right to be upset with your father. Realistically, he could have exercised other options before putting your cat up for adoption. I'm sure during that time he was stressed and concerned about your health, so a quick fix was easier for him than a true solution. If your health allowed you the ability to be alert and sentient, he could have worked with you instead of taking it upon himself to decide on your behalf. Ultimately, that was your cat, and life is not replaceable like a car or a plate would be. I urge you to not guilty for how what happened came to be because it seems like it was completely out of your hands, there was nothing you could have done. \n\nIt's important that you're grateful for the things he did help you with. Have you ever spoken with him about this beyond the time that it happened? You don't have to forgive anyone for anything. However, it takes a lot of work to hold a grudge with someone, especially if you want a relationship with them. If you haven't spoken about it since it happened, I urge you to talk with him with humility and address what you're grateful for, but explain how this still sticks with you. If you've already spoken to him and he refused an apology, I don't think you'd be an asshole for not forgiving him.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know if I could ever fully forgive a family member if they did that to my cat. \n\nCan you check with the Humane Society? Maybe your cat is still up for adoption.", "If pets are disposable things then this is something easy to get over. If they\u2019re a life long (theirs) commitment who becomes family, you\u2019re NTA for not forgiving him. \n\nDid he even take the amount of time it took to pack up the cat to consider any other options or did he just say, f this, and dump her? This was an incredibly cruel thing to do and completely unnecessary. The fact that he didn\u2019t just let her die in your apartment is not reason to forgive what he did. \n\nIf anyone feels like downvoting, that\u2019s fine. I can die on this hill.", "NTA. I would never be able to forgive someone for leaving my cat at a shelter.", "NTA. What a callous, horrific thing for him to do. Even if he couldn't have cared for the cat himself, there must have been other people who could have fostered the poor thing. I'm so sorry that you came home from a terrible health battle only to find that your companion had been tossed aside. I'm sure she would have been a comfort to you while you were healing.", "Nta. Its understandable.  They are family.", "Nta. Cats practically take care of themselves. They just need food, water, and a clean litter box once a week.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't understand why you didn't go to the shelter and see if 1) the cat was adopted or 2) if they had info on who adopted it. I would have called or visited every shelter. \n\nI agree that it's awful he didn't find other options, but I think you need to realize he doesn't see pets the same way you do.", "NTA", "Nta!!!", "He can take care of a dog but not a cat? I find that hard to believe especially when you take into consideration cats are a lot more independent than dogs are. \n\nI have a so many questions:\n\nWhat kind of cat did you have?\nWhat kind of dog does your dad have?\nWhat would your father do if you had children that needed care? \n\n\nNTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t forgive anybody that would put an innocent animal in danger.", "NTA. Oh wow. This is the most heartbreaking post I've ever read on here. You are not overreacting. I could never forgive someone for giving my cat away.  Never.  That's horrid. He could have done so many other things instead.  I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "I'm horrified reading this.  That person would be dead to me without a second thought.  NTA.", "NTA - loss of a pet can be a huge emotional blow and particularly in the situation.  It would probably have been very healing for you to come home to your cat, so it was a very shortsighted action on your dads part.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem like your father was doing this from a malicious standpoint, he may have been overwhelmed and thought this was a way to make sure the cat was cared for.   Perhaps viewing it as a bad mistake would make it possible to find forgiveness.\n\nIt might be possible to find out if your cat was adopted, and if not reunited at least know it had a good home.", "ESH. Id say NTA but you said \"its just a cat\" IT IS A LIVING THING WITH FEELINGS. Cats are complex creatures too and all that poor little cat knows is one day you didnt come home and then some guy took him somewhere else never to see you again.\n\nYour dad definately had other options! Find a friend to take care of her, find a cat hotel, Something!\n\nInstead day 1 he said \"by the way i sent your cat away idk what happened to him im a lazy asshole\"\n\nI would NEVER forgive him for that", "NAH. Sounds as if your father did a tremendous amount physically and financially for you while you were laid up. Sounds like you are aware he also suffered emotionally over your illness. I think you owe him a debt of gratitude. He stepped up for you in a major way, a way many parents would not or could not; and while his choices might not have been your choices, he made a responsible choice for your pet cat. He did his best. \n\nOf course you have every right to be unhappy about the fate of your pet cat, but it does sound as if caring for your pet was beyond your father's threshold of responsibility. Apparently there were no other friends or relatives of yours available. What your father did is ultimately pretty responsible. He could have abandoned your cat, he could have just turned it out. He took it to a humane shelter. \n\nOf course you will grieve losing your cat. I would also suspect that your medical emergency may have some lingering effects, both physical and emotional. I suggest you get some therapy for your anger and grief. I don't think taking it out on your father is appropriate. Now it's up to you to do your best to recover.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Cat's organs start to fail after just a day of not eating. \n\nAnyway, giving away the cat without a word is such a dick move. Even if he couldn't take care of her, he should have said so, and you could have asked around if a friend could do it or something.

We figured out how to make sure my cats and this stinkbeast would be safe around each other. And we let it sleep in our beds because he missed my MIL. I also stirred homemade broth into his food because he was so upset he wasn't eating otherwise. I cuddled the smelly thing, I scratched his ears, and I found time to walk him even though I was spending hours every day at the hospital. \n\nDo you know why we did those things?

He had plenty of options and he didn't use any of them.\nHere are some options I can think of in 10 seconds He had (at least in my country):\nCalling a shelter and explaining the situation (it is possible in my country to give a pet to a shelter when you temporarily don't have any options to care for them)\nGetting her into a pet hotel and explain the situation\nAsking you if you have any trusted friends/neighbours\nAsking around if anyone is willing to temporarily take  her in like friends, neighbours, your mailman... You could even ask on Craigslist but that would be the most \"dangerous\" thing that you don't get her back because the new people fell in love with her...  would have been still better than giving her away without even knowing if she got adopted or worse.\n\nYour dad did something terrible because he doesn't care for cats. He knew that it would upset you and he didn't want to deal with it, that's why he didn't tell you while you were in the hospital and that's why he didn't stay when you got home. You can probably tell that I am extremely angry just by reading it, but right now I would do the same with him if he isn't able to take care of himself. \"Oh dad you want to live with me because you are alone? I am sorry, but I can't take care of you but here is a nice residence I will not remember as soon as I dropped you off. You want me to visit you? Sorry, I can never remember your name and your info, so it will be too hard for them to lead me to the right person.\"", "Did you not bring up the care for your cat? Could you not? Sounds like you just expected your elderly father to take care of everything in your life with no discussion about it at all. If you cared so much for the cat then why didn\u2019t you make sure your dad was either able to take care of it, or if not, find another arrangement. Just sounds like you expected something to happen without prior discussion and now you\u2019re mad about it because it didn\u2019t go your way. Your dad still 100% should have discussed something like that before taking such extreme measures. Your both AHs imo.", "NTA\nThat is truly painful. Im so sorry.", "NTA\n\nWhy do I have the feeling that the \"humane society\" is 'I put them outside and left them there and am assuming that they would have been collected by now'.", "NTA but are you certain he\u2019s telling the truth? What if he did forget to take care of the cat, and he\u2019s made up this shelter story to cover up for a sadder end?", "NTA. In this day and age there is no excuse not to find other options. He could have asked neighbors, looked for a temporary foster, paid a petsitter or boarded the cat. Plus he didn't even bother to tell you. \n\nBut it also sounds like you didn't ask about the cat for a month.", "NTA. He stole your property and breached your trust. You probably could have reported him to the police and sued if you wanted to. If something like this ever happens again, I would go straight to the humane society to get your pet back.", "Cat kennels/hotels exist. So do pet sitters. This is awful, and so thoughtless and inconsiderate. Animals are not disposable inconveniences. Doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like or approve of pets, it\u2019s no secret the pets are family to their owners. Would he have done the same with her kid??", "NTA - I know he had a lot going on, but very worst case scenario he could have hired someone to go by every couple of days.\n\nIf it helps  the Humane Society is a no-kill shelter and they screen adopters, so she's probably lived a cushy life.", "NTA. i can not imagine coming home only to realize my bestfriend is gone. i have a cat and he is my everything. i wouldn\u2019t forgive anyone that put my cat up for adoption and possibly put their safety at risk. pets are family. there are so many other options that could have been considered to make sure your cat was fine while you were momentarily gone. im so sorry this happened to you. this is very heartbreaking", "NTA. Your dad did a horrible thing and idk if I\u2019d be able to forgive him in the same situation. Tell him the only hope of reconciliation is to get you your specific cat back. If he can manage you\u2019ve taught him a lesson if not then idk what you should do. So sorry this is terrible\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA. I almost died having my son and my husband hopped on a plane to the next state over to be with him while I was recovering. My parents did everything they could to support us, including helping with my animals. It wasn't perfect or convenient but they did it because it was right and temporary. You have every right to feel the way that you do.", "NTA, op I'm going to ask and this may be a little hard...are you sure he wasn't lying? Is it possible he came to your place a week or so later and found the cat deceased? \n\nI only ask cause surrendering her under the note of very sick owner or owner unable to care she should have been able to be adopted and their photo somewhere online, a description. Also him being so laze about the whole thing unless he's normally callous about animals and details. Like if you asked which one couldn't he have used a landmark? Like the one near the Walmart, the one downtown ECT. Even if he wasn't home. This reads as him being either so utterly heartless about the whole thing or he found the cat dead and couldn't look you in the eyes.", "This would be my hill to die on!! NTA", "The fact that you still talk to your dad after that astounds me. I don\u2019t even care that he paid your hospital bill. I\u2019d fuck him up NTA", "I would never have spoken to any of them again or introduced them to my son!", "Hill o' corpses, this one.\nNTA.", "OP knows what she has to do when her father will need help, like deciding between staying home or going to a retirement house, and which retirement house...", "My thoughts as well is anything a person is willing to do to a pet, they are willing to also possibly do to a child. Meaning dad may decide to just hand over to social services any kid during a medical emergency. At that point he can wail \"It's not the same\" all he wants, but he failed to take basic decency here. He lost trust to look after the helpless creature in OP's care, human or not.   \n\n\nPS it is the same reason to not trust a significant other that can't treat a pet decently when visiting. How people treat pets and those they see below themselves tells you a lot, and you should always listen to that.", "I lost my dog in a divorce twenty years ago and I\u2019m still not over it.   If I die on this hill, you\u2019ll find the name, \u201cSophie\u201d, carved on my heart.", "Seriously he could have just let OP know he couldn\u2019t care for the cat while she was sick so she could have called some friends to find someone who would be available to check on the cat while she was gone. Hell it literally only takes stopping in once a week to feed them and clear the litter. Admittedly, a month is a bit long to leave the cat without human stimulation, but it\u2019s do-able in an emergency like this. Most friends with cats already are willing to take on an extra cat for a month in their own home since they already have the litter box and hair issues from their own cats. Instead OPs dad said he was handling everything with her apartment, making her falsely think he was taking care of her cat so she couldn\u2019t make other arrangements. I\u2019d be pissed. \n\nNTA Op", "I assumed this as well, or that he took it home and his dog may have hurt the cat?? But she has never given her dad an opportunity to explain. It sounds like at 29 years old (not a child by any means) he cares for her deeply and has not only done so emotionally and physically but he went out of his way financially during this time. It sounds like he was trying to protect her from more stress and grief during this time.", "I\u2019m with you\u2014OP had no emergency care plans in place for her pet. Her father made sure she still had a place to live and no medical debt. I have emergency care plans for my children AND my dogs. Seems like she never even asked about the cat when her dad visited, either. Where was her concern while she was hospitalized?", "?? He told her after she got home from the hospital, a month later, that he had given the cat away. She was never given the chance to find an alternate solution, have a friend take care of the cat, etc. This was an incredible cruel, heartless thing for the dad to do. I would never forgive someone for doing this to me, and OP is NTA.", "Her dad was overwhelmed with concern for her and only visited her at the hospital twice in a month-long stay? \ud83d\udc80 NTA, but the dad certainly is.", "It's holding on to the anger and resentment, that's why they say forgiveness is for you. The offender (OP's dad in this case) is probably able to sleep at night feeling he did what he could handle at the time. What's done is done, and we can't ever take back what we did in the past. By choosing not to forgive someone, you are letting that pain resurface every day. It consumes a part of your mind and has a hold over you. I can't very well judge what actually happened, because I wasn't there and we only have one side of the story. But the question was \"WIBTA if I don't forgive my dad?\" and I think she very much would be the asshole - to herself - if she doesn't forgive her dad. When you forgive someone you are not saying you think it's ok. You are releasing the anger and moving forward. Sometimes moving forward means you no longer want the person you have forgiven in your life.", "I'm sure they didn't want to make a 4 year old feel responsible for a cat being put down. \"Hey there kiddo, ya know how you've got this chronic bronchitis caused by the cat you love so much? Well we're going to put him down because we're scared for your life and you're more important than the cat. We're emotionally distressed and don't have the emotional energy to think through exhaustive solutions. We just need to get the cat out of the house.\" That conversation wouldn't go over so well with a 4 yr old who just loves the cat and can't understand the correlation. I hope you will be able to move past this one day and realize they may not have handled it perfectly, but parents make mistakes too. You can't hold onto that anger forever.", "I have a sperm donor who has never been involved in my life until he popped up because he needed money. This man is her FATHER who she acknowledged was distraught over her illness and hospital stay. She is 29 years old and an adult yet he stepped in, possibly during his retirement when he wasn\u2019t steadily bringing in an income, paid her rent and THOUSANDS of dollars in bills for her without so much as a thank you. Instead she admits to being absolutely ugly to him and basically turning her back on him and not including him in her life. So she\u2019s kind of like my sperm bank and only included people in her life when she needs something, especially money. Too bad she wasn\u2019t responsible enough at any point during that month to ask her dad about her \u201cbeloved\u201d pet or call another family member/friend to help.
