About 6 months ago, his lease was up and we decided that he would move in with me. Previous to this, we had spent nights at each other's places and there were no issues with bathroom habits. \r  \n\r  \nMy BF gets up about 30 minutes before me and goes to the ensuite bathroom to do his thing. No biggy... except that he has the most malodorous bowl movements I've ever had the displeasure of smelling. The sounds of him intermittently shitting out doom nuggets are equally as bad. Mind you, I worked as an EMT for years, so I'm not a squeamish or fussy person at all. I love a good poop joke/story! The smell of his shit lingers for a good 15-20 minutes afterward; the stank cloud might is nearly visible, and you can taste it on top of everything. It makes showering or getting ready in the morning a horrible experience, and I have yet to find any spray to mask or get rid of the smell. \r  \n\r  \nHere is the issue- he refuses to shut the bathroom door, or walk an additional 10 feet to go to the family bath in hallway to do the dirty deed. If he did either of those things, the smell/sound would not wake me up and I would not be starting each morning feeling sick and angry at the method of my wake up. He says that he is not really awake when  goes into the bathroom and thus cannot be expected to remember to shut the door. I think he is full of metaphorical and real bullshit as remembers to grab his phone and bottle of water off the bedside table as he goes in, and then spends a good 20 minutes sitting there scrolling through the morning news. He could shut the door at any point during this process!   \r  \n\r  \nAfter weeks of us going back and forth, I hit my breaking point this last Wednesday. I went to the store and bought a new doorknob for the bathroom that has a key lock and replaced it. It is my house, after all. He goes to bed before me, so after I got ready for bed I shut and locked the bathroom door. Come that next morning, he got out of bed, could not get into the bathroom, yelled at me about it being locked, and then went into the family bath to poop. Problem solved. I didn't have to deal with his shit, was able to enjoy my shower for the first time in months, and he still could follow his bathroom routine. It was a win for both of us. \r  \n\r  \nLater that night, we got into a massive fight about me locking the door. He called me controlling and unfair, among other things. He said that I had no right to lock him out of the bathroom as he also pays rent. I told him that it was still my house, he has the capacity to remember to shut the bathroom door and turn on the vent in mornings, and he was being an asshole for not doing so after I had requested it for so many months. AITA?\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: My BF has the smelliest/loudest shits and wakes me up each morning because he won't shut the bathroom door.

Asks him why he is so invested in making your life miserable?!?  Using the hall bathroom is the simplest and KINDEST thing he could do for someone he supposedly loves.  Is forcing you to wake and suffer the smell of his morning deposit some weird, toxic, masculine power play?", "NTA. \n\nHe proved over and over again that he just doesn\u2019t give a shit (pun intended) about how his actions affect you. \nThat said take a look at other things. Is it just this one thing and can you see yourselves in ten years having worked it out and being happy?", "NTA.  He sounds really inconsiderate.  Did he ever have a reason to refuse going to the other bathroom?  I wouldn\u2019t accept the sleepy excuse on that, though.", "NTA. I close the door to shit even when I lived alone. I like the way my home smells. He can always shit in the yard if he needs a feeling of freedom during his business", "NTA there is such an easy solution to this disagreement that you already pointed out to him and he refuses to compromise. That's your real problem - that he is being totally inconsiderate for no damn reason at all.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I have a pact that the en-suite is pee only.  Poop and showers take place in the guest bathroom.   For odor and letting the other person sleep in when we don't wake up at the same time reasons.", "NTA he\u2019s completely disregarding your feelings here. I hate people who wake up first then proceed to wake everyone else up. All round shitty behaviour.", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I were married 15 years before we shared a bathroom. When we met his habits and standards of neatness were so different from mine, that separate bathrooms were a critical relationship criteria. As we moved around we traded who got the ensuite vs the hall bath. Doing this kept each of us from being annoyed/angry over a simple issue. My concern is your fellow\u2019s thoughtlessness and discourtesy towards you. He dismissed your complaints and expected you to give in. It\u2019s great that you stood your ground on the problem.", "NTA. He could certainly remember to shut the door if he wanted to; his excuse for not be able to \"remember\" to do so is nonsensical!\n\nYour actions were drastic, but he'd shown he wasn't going to listen to you. And he did have another bathroom handy, so I don't see what the problem is. HE is in fact being the one controlling by disregarding your simple request and continuing to use the bathroom you don't want him to use.\n\nIf he doesn't want to be with someone he thinks is \"controlling,\" he's free to leave.", "NTA. He should be closing the door, turning on the fan, and liberally using Poo Pouri", "NTA.  His dating mask is slipping, and I'm afraid this might be just the beginning.  He is behaving unreasonably because he is unreasonable. He is acting inconsiderately because he is inconsiderate.  \n\nPeople can act reasonable and considerate some of the time, or most of the time, and it is still an act.", "I've been married for 26 years and my husband never stinks up the ensuite in the mornings.  He uses another washroom.  He is usually gone to work before I wake up.  That's what considerate spouses do.  No talk was had.

You would have won even if he was just waking you up every morning, but, uh, you super-won this one.", "Nta. You\u2019re not forcing him to go the gas station .

That is really rude of him", "NTA\n\nDude needs to be more considerate. If his BMs are that toxic, he should be closing the door and running the exhaust fan", "NTA. First of all, thank you for posting this. It gave me a great laugh. My husband has the same stank issues. LOL. He however, happily goes to his Bro Throne away from me to do it. I think you are entirely justified for locking him out.", "NTA\n\nReading this, I could not believe your BFs age.  Your requests are quite literally very easy to do.  Turn on a vent.  Shut the door.  An eight-year-old would be able to do things without being told more than a couple of times.\n\nKeep the bathroom door locked! Do not share the key until he can get his brain to work properly!", "INFO:  1.  Is he a shitty bf other than that?  2.  Is he related to my dad?", "He cannot be expected to remember to shut the door\u2026.right.", "NTA.   I was a little unsure until you said he leaves the door open AND doesn't turn on the fan.  WHO DOES THAT?  Why is it so important to him that you smell his poo?  No.  And tell him to see a GI specialist.  Yes, poop stinks, but super stinky poop usually indicates an issue.  \n\n\nETA:  Fire would help.  Striking a match will usually 'burn up' most of the smell.  For normal humans, anyway :P", "NTA.\n\nHe won\u2019t do the most basic level of politeness while using the restroom- close the door- so I fully support what you are doing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine not shutting the door and using the vent in general, especially when my partner has complained.\n\nHe\u2019s being gross and inconsiderate. My parents have been married for 45 years, my dad used the downstairs bathroom without saying a word to anyone, and uses a nice spray after, and no one has ever commented once on his situation because he is doing all the right things, even though we know that bathroom is unsafe for 20 minutes after he leaves it. He is a true gentleman.", "Using the family bathroom might be \"a lot\" to ask, but for you to ask him to close the door is COMPlETELY reasonable. The fact that he doesn't want to shows how inconsiderate he is.\n\nNote - best way to get rid of the poop smell is scented candles (not a spray). Poop smell is methane gas, and they're flammable.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that he does this while he knows it bothers you so much and when there's another bathroom available for that matter is basically just open hostility. Blocking him out of the bathroom is the least you should do. I'm surprised you haven't dumped him, to be frank. It wouldn't be an overreaction at all to just tell him that the relationship is over.
