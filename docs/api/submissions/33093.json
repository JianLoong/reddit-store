Months ago, I bought some apple cinnamon flavored ice cream to try. When I got home with it I attempted to offer it to my bf, who is a vegan btw, not knowing that the ingredients listed milk. He asked \u201cis it vegan??\u201d And I said \u201cI think so\u201d, but after we both read over the ingredients list he was like \u201cno it\u2019s not.\u201d I apologized bc I didn\u2019t want him to think I was carelessly offering him something made with animal products. \n\nA couple weeks later, I came back to the freezer to finish eating my ice cream and it was no where to be found. I asked my bf about it, and turns out he ate it and claims it was \u201cfreezer burnt anyway.\u201d But he also didn\u2019t ask me. At this point in time I did not press him about getting me more I just laughed and moved on. However, every now and then he would go and buy some ice cream for himself and I would jus say a little something like \u201cyou know you owe me ice cream so where is mine?\u201d And he has dx adhd so I wasn\u2019t being obnoxious about him getting me ice cream, it was just something I had brought up once or twice after seeing him buy his own ice cream. \n\nThe other day we went to the store together to get stuff and he mentioned \u201cI know I owe you ice cream\u2026just get something vegan.\u201d At first I was happy that he even thought to get it for me at that moment. But then I remembered that the ice cream of mine that he ate was not vegan and when I mentioned that to him, he just shook his head and said he will not spend his money on non vegan ice cream. I already knew he wouldn\u2019t buy something non vegan, but it just aggrevated me that he was now trying to restrict me on what ice cream I get as a replacement for the one that HE ate. I suggested that if it was that serious then he could just send me money. He didn\u2019t respond, he was just silent (and later described it as disbelief). Apparently it was some huge shock to him that I wanted him to send me money instead bc according to him, he offered that at one point and I refused, but I genuinely have no recollection of such a conversation. Even if it were a conversation that happened before, am I not allowed to change my mind and say this works for me rn? I ended up just getting some oatly ice cream but I was still very upset bc why can\u2019t I get the flavor I originally bought for myself? \n\nOn the walk back home from the store, we unfortunately started arguing bc he felt the need to defend to me why he will not spend money on non vegan food. I tried to express to him that I would not force him to do something that goes against his morals, but I have a hard time understanding how consumption of animal products is not against his morals as a vegan. He claimed that his consumption of the product does not commission the sale/purchase of animal products.
