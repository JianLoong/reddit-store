He is a really interesting dude and a lot of my colleagues dislike him for that and often say mean stuff about him. One day I was at work and heard other colleagues gossiping about my mate, saying that my team leader told them that they can't fire him due to the fact that he is mentally handicapped (which is not true). So I decided to tell this little information to my friend based on the feeling that if someone said something like that about me, I would simply like to know about it. He ofc became really upset which is completely understandable and he went to my tl's supervisor to get help.\n\nThe next day my tl and the supervisor wanted to talk to me. They basically said that I'm a really mean person for hurting my friend unnecessary, and he didn't deserve to be distracted by gossips like this. And yeah, other stuff about how much my tl is disappointed in me, that I broke my tl's trust, and now my tl has to recover his image. And they ranted about that gossiping is not nice and why do I spread such mean rumors about my tl...\n\nI don't think I did anything bad. I talk to this college/friend daily, he is the nicest person I know and he is the only one I can trust at my workplace. He recieved a lot of blacklash and hate since he is different than other people and he is constantly getting bullied.\nMy tl in the other hand is not a nice person. He does gossip about other people, laugh at other people and basically talks down to everyone he doesn't like. I don't have any proof of him saying this particular thing since he didn't tell it to me directly but I could definitely believe this. My tl tried to manipulate me by saying that how possibly could he say such a thing when he is the one who stops everyone from talking shit about other people with mental health issues. I've never heard him do that, but I can't say it's not true.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667585670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym646c/aita_for_telling_my_coworkerfriend_about_a_rumor/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I would immediately write down everything that happened from hearing the rumors to the meeting with the TL.  And then I would go to TL's boss.  This guy is a total disaster as a supervisor, takes no responsibility for his actions, and I think he is the type to set you up to get fired.  Protect yourself.  AND, your friend should not be subjected to the aholes you work with treating him that way.", "Assuming you told the truth and only told the person the gossip was about and told him out of kindness like you said NTA\n\nBoth of you get out of there asap, this place is a disaster zone and will damage both of you", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you talk to the team leader about the gossip first or bring in HR"]}
