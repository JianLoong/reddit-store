Her future in-laws aren\u2019t from the same country as us so my friend had never met them in person. Well after they got engaged they came to visit and my friend decided to have an engagement dinner so the two families could meet while the parents were in town.\n\nMy friend invited me and her other friend considering we are childhood friends and have gotten super close lately. The dinner was going to be at my friends house. Well the morning of the dinner my friends AC went out and it\u2019s summer here so she picked a restaurant. She told me she wanted to make a good impression for the parents so she picked a super fancy restaurant. My heart immediately sank because I knew I simply couldn\u2019t afford this place especially with such short notice. Embarrassed(my friend has always been well off.) by my financial situation I told her that something came up and I wasn\u2019t able to make it tonight. She went quiet on the phone and then began to beg me to come. She said it would mean a lot and help her feel less nervous. Feeling bad I agreed to come. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. I got dressed up and drove the hour into the city to the restaurant. When I got there I sat next to my friend  and was directly across from the future MIL. When the waitress gave everyone their menus I didn\u2019t pick mine up and just made small talk with people at the table until it came time to order. Everyone ordered their food with whatever fancy drink. When it came to me I just shook my head and said \u201cjust water please, thank\u201d and smiled. Everyone immediately looked uncomfortable and the waitress asked if I was sure which did make me feel a little embarrassed and said yes before looking at my friend for her to order. I sat at the table and continued in small talk. \n\nI thought the night went well. Nobody mentioned I wasn\u2019t eating or seemed to care besides that brief moment. I thought all was good until the next day my friend texted me saying that what I did was embarrassing, tacky, and made her look bad in front of her In-laws. So now I feel bad. I didn\u2019t think it would be embarrassing for her. I figured if anyone would be embarrassed it would be me. So I don\u2019t know.

She should have discreetly said, \u201cthis one is on me\u201d and made sure her friend who drove an hour ate and drank at her event. You\u2019re a good friend for not ordering and sticking someone else with the bill but still attending. Personally I would have been embarrassed with myself if I let my friend go hungry and thirsty at an event I had pressured them to attend.\n\nEdit: Pressured > invited", "Tough one. I think I'm going with NTA but you should've communicated better. You should've said you couldn't afford it and won't be eating but will join them. Given she initially invited you to dinner, I think she should've offered to pay for your meal.", "You should have just told your friend you can\u2019t afford it. People acting like the friend is a bad person saying they forced OP to go to somewhere they couldn\u2019t afford, but the friend literally had no idea and just thought their friend was bailing on them last second. I think not eating just comes across as super weird. You need to be the one to communicate issues it\u2019s not on your friend.\n\nEdit for clarity: I don\u2019t really think anyone is an AH I think OP just needs to communicate the real reason behind it", "NAH... this seems to be just bad communication. Does she really know how much you can afford? \n\nYou could have just said, i am sorry but that is way to expensive for me. I do that all the time when my \"rich\" friends ask me to go out. Sometimes they invite me if they really want to go or we choose somethign else.\n\nGoing to a restaurant where everyone is eating but you jsut drink water... yeah that is super weird and a bit rude.\n\nYour friends reaction afterwards was also rude. She could have asked why you didn't eat anything instead of attacking.\n\nBut all of that comes down to: Get a spine, and tell people if you cannot afford something ;)", "NAH you should have informed her beforehand that you couldn't afford to eat there and that's why you wouldn't be able to go. Instead you lied and didn't communicate. If she had known she could have either offered to pay for you or accepted your decline if the invitation.", "Info:  were you expected to contribute to the bill or was your friend paying?", "NTA\n\nNobody has brought it up, I wouldn't worry overmuch. Your friend lacks social-awareness. Might be worth straight up telling her in the future what you told us here:\n\n>My heart immediately sank because I knew I simply couldn\u2019t afford this place especially with such short notice.\n\nIt likely never occurred to her until you ordered water that this was the case. People born to wealth often have no concept of budgeting or having to choose between food or rent. Honesty might have either got you an out on attending or (if your friend has any sense of propriety) a meal comp'd by your friend, as she was asking you to put yourself out by traveling into town as a favor.", "Did you tell her you couldn't afford it? Like beforehand?", "I don't understand how you use the word friend. Sounds like an acquaintance.", "NTA but this could've been avoided by honest communication with your friend. Even if she was oblivious. But why didn't she ask why you didn't order anything? She knows you don't have the money at the moment,  don't she?", "NTA.\n\nYou told your friend the restaurant was out of your budget. You agreed to drive all the way to the restaurant just to support your friend. Your friend is the AH for not appreciating your presence and giving you a gentle way out (e.g. telling you it's okay not to come and that she'll do something with you later).", "I would be interested in how many there wee at this dinner , and did everybody get separate checks, ?   It is tough on friendship when the money is unequal.  Even if the friend wanted to pay for hers, sometimes that doesnt always turn out right, and ends up here instead", "NTA. You have stated to your friend several times that you don\u2019t have the money and they are picking outings that require money. You have tried to decline and they guilt you. What else can you do in this situation? In college, my roommates and I had one roommate with NO money. Every cent he made went towards tuition and fees. We didn\u2019t want to leave him out though, so we took him to Olive Garden. It was great. One of us would order a soup (that nice gnocchi one), the others would order salad and extra breadsticks. He ate like a king for free and we still got to enjoy our time with him. Real friends make it work.", "NTA if I change where my dinner was being hosted going from a meal that was provided to a restaurant that you had to pay for I would be offering to pay the bill as I grew up low income and now not all can afford and now I am fortunate enough to have a fantastic partner who makes great money and I have a great job as well. Sorry your friend doesn\u2019t understand.", "What a shi**y friend you got. She probably knows everything about your financial situation and still begged you to come. She should had ordered something for you like a cheap salad or side dish instead of sitting there and acting dumb. Then she blames you for embarrassing her ?? You are a good friend who went beyond your way to support your friend even though you couldn\u2019t afford food. \n\nIf I were you I would rethink this friendship especially because your friend is \u201cwell off\u201d and didn\u2019t order some cheap thing for you. She INVITED you to a fancy restaurant then she can also pay for you. Prepare yourself for her bachelorette party and the cost of being a bridesmaid to \u2018this\u2019 friend, she will expect you to pay for things you can\u2019t afford.", "NTA, I\u2019ve done the same before and to be honest it\u2019s just better to tell the truth. It\u2019s embarrassing but if they are a good friend, they will understand (or possibly cover you). \n\nI found out at the end of the meal it was all paid for by the host, and they thought it was so strange I didn\u2019t eat\u2026 it was super awkward and just not ideal.", "NTA, your friend is oblivious and shouldn't have expected you to go to some expensive restaurant to impress her family. You can't spend money you don't have.", "NTA. Usually, the people having the engagement party pay for their guests, so it's strange that she didn't (even if it was relocated.) And she's the one who begged you to come when you said you couldn't go. Not sure why you just didn't tell her you were low on funds right now, but that still doesn't make you the a\\*\\*hole. She could have assumed you weren't feeling well or maybe you were fasting (I do this twice a week, cuz it's part of my regime.) Anyway, your friend is TA for calling you out and saying you embarrassed her. I don't even understand why she'd think that, cuz it doesn't make sense. She's your friend and she should have at least known you had good reason even if you didn't say what it was.", "NTA - If you were my friend, and i begged you to come, and you didnt order anything. You bet i would've discreetly texted you that i'd cover whatever you had. \n\nYou should've said you didnt have the budget to your friend tho, so she could've known ahead of time. These things happen, move on and tell your friend it was unfortunate you didn't mention it ahead of time.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite someone to dinner, esp pressuring them, youre the host and should be ready to pay for it. Thats how my friends and I do it.\n\nHowever, you could have spoken up a bit about your concern. Close friends can share that kind of info.", "Why is OP expected to pay when attending for her friend. NTA. Your friend should have offered to pay beforehand since it\u2019s her dinner with her people.", " Wow. Your friend sucks. NTA.", "NTA. Friends dont let friends go hungry.", "NTA. A friend of mine recently got engaged and wanted all of her bridesmaids to get together for lunch so we could all meet eachother. She chose a restaurant for all of us to meet at and I knew I wouldn't like anything on the menu so I ate beforehand. She chose a spicy Mexican restaurant. I cant even handle pepper on anything let alone actual spicy stuff. I told everyone in the group chat I would eat beforehand. All I ordered was a pepsi to drink. And we all had a great time! My friend was completely understanding of my situation too", "NTA. \n\nBut I'm confused why you weren't honest with your supposed friend. She would have understood if you didn't want to go, or would have offered to pay. If she wouldn't, then she's not a friend!", "NTA\n\nWhile it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business what your financial situation is, I think it would have been a wise move to be up front and simply say, \u201cI can\u2019t go there tonight. I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t have it in my budget at the moment. I hope you have a great night!\u201d", "You should have been honest, but NTA.\n\nIsn't it proper socially that when you invite someone out that you would cover the cost of their meal? You didn't have the money to spend and you gave a fair reason to not be there but she still begged you to come. I would communicate clearer with your friend in the future to avoid situations like these.", "ESH but very soft YTA\n\nAdmitting financial struggles is always embarrassing. And from what I gather from your comments, your friend is aware of the fact that you are experiencing them. If she were a good friend she would have acknowledged it and offered to pay for your meal, ESPECIALLY given the fact that it was her celebration. \n\nSoft YTA though for not communicating better and putting your foot down. Maybe next time try saying 'I'm going through a tough time financially right now and while I would love to be there and support you I just don't have the means, I hope you understand.' \n\nNot everyone is well off or made of money and that's okay. If you have a job and are a hard worker, there's nothing to be ashamed of OP. People who do have money and don't understand or care about other people's struggles are major AH.", "ESH \n\nBut more so on the friends side for being oblivious\n\nWhere you went wrong as you recognised is just not being honest with her, you should have told her you would love to go but you really can\u2019t afford it.", "NTA\n\n Inviting people to restaurants and making them pay was even tackier than that. I'm sure that's what made her look bad in fron of her in laws.", "YTA yes you should have told your friend the truth and yes you made it awkward for everyone by not ordering anything", "Anyone saying ESH or YTA has likely never experienced poverty, and should kindly (or unkindly) f off.\n\nOP, NTA. I've been in your situation before, it's rough and demoralizing. Don't be afraid to tell people ehy you can't participate, but certainly don't ever feel bad for not. Poverty is a vicious cycle.", "NTA , your friend picked a pricey fancy restaurant to \"impress\" her MIL , begs U for coming and then U basically have to waste your money for stupid fancy shit. ( tbh I'm very anti capitalistic and having worked in restaurants a lot, those things are often just a rip off). Yes you should have been more transparent maybe and actually I would be questioning my friendship if I can't even be open with my problems. But you drove 2 hours for her and U did accompany her in the end.  Might be a cultural thing but in my country (Austria) it's not such a big fuss if one in the group simply doesn't want to drink .", "NTA. She invited you, basically emotionally blackmailed you into coming, she should be footing the bill. \n\nIt made her look bad, because that\u2019s how she acted.", "YTA. You\u2019re 23 communicate like it. If you can\u2019t afford something tell the person inviting you upfront next time. Are financial problems embarrassing? They shouldn\u2019t be but I could see why you\u2019d be embarrassed. Just explain your situation next time. \n\nYou\u2019re a good friend for wanting to support her but if you can\u2019t afford going out and know it, then don\u2019t. How awkward a dinner it was with everyone eating and chatting then you just drinking a water. I don\u2019t understand the other votes and comments, your friend didn\u2019t force you to go out. \n\nEveryone yelling \u201cshe should\u2019ve payed she invited you!\u201d It was an engagement dinner, what wedding couple pays for their own engagement dinner? And how was the friend supposed to know she needed to pay for OP if she didn\u2019t communicate this with her?\n\nPeople with money are awful at knowing when they are around poor people. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t already shared that information with your friend beforehand for outings.", "Soft YTA\n\nSorry.. But a simple \"I can't afford it\" May have given your friend a chance to either offer to pay for you or allowed her to understand why you were skipping the event at the very least.", "YTA \n\nYou should have been honest with your friend and simply said, \"I'm really sorry I just can't afford to go to X tonight, I hope you have an amazing time\" \n\n\nGoing to a restaurant with a group of people and not ordering anything is very odd", "NTA, maybe should have told your friend you couldnt afford it so not well handled but not the asshole", "NTA. It would be best to tell your friend outright that you are too broke to go out to dinner, but you did what you could think of at the time, and probably would have felt too embarrassed to say anything like that. Going forward, if she wants you for a friend she should step up and consider that your circumstances are different than hers. After you have told her one time that you do not have much money and this isn't going to change in the near future, she should not put you on the spot to have to tell her this again.", "It\u2019s a bit weird to not get anything at a restaurant and makes for an awkward situation for everyone involved. Where I live, it is also considered rude towards the restaurant, as you\u2019re getting serviced and taking up a spot. I understand your predicament though. \n\nYou probably should have been honest with your friend about not being able to afford that restaurant. If I were your friend, I would have offered to pay for you, as I was the one who sprung it on you with such short notice.", "I would say slight YTA. I see both sides, but I think it\u2019s more your fault bc I think it was on you to tell her that you couldn\u2019t afford it \u2014 she may have some general idea of your financial situation (ie knows you\u2019re not well off or knows you can\u2019t afford to be a bridesmaid), but maybe wouldn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t afford a dinner \u2014 maybe the cheapest thing on the menu would\u2019ve been affordable, idk. She\u2019s also planning a wedding so maybe it wasn\u2019t at the forefront of her mind.", "NTA you don't have to eat if you don't want to. Sounds like she is just stressing out about her MIL and directing it at you", "YTA. All you had to do was say to your friend \u201cI can\u2019t afford to eat out, I\u2019ll schedule time to meet the family away from the restaurant\u201d", "Soft YTA.  She\u2019s oblivious but you should have been honest.  You had the courage to turn down being a bridesmaid so just stick with this \u201eI am on a budget\u201c theme and eventually it may sink in.  You may want to apologize to her for how you handled it and for embarrassing her.  It\u2019s a way to heal things but also set boundaries so she stops asking you to do expensive things.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, however it may be a huge etiquette thing. It is out the ordinary for people to come to restaurants with groups of people and not eat, even if it\u2019s something small. Everyone was probably thinking the same thing and I\u2019m sure there was some talk after about what was going on. Ultimately the lack of communication and honesty has caused a riff. I think if you were honest about why you couldn\u2019t go, the situation would have turned out differently. All friendships are different, but when my friends say they can\u2019t do something because they don\u2019t have money, I\u2019m paying regardless and don\u2019t worry about paying me back because that\u2019s what true friends do!", "ESH because you can't go to a restaurant and not eat. The restaurant has costs too.\n\nYour friend should have paid for you, though.", "YTA for not just being honest with your friend. \n\n I\u2019m assuming she knows your financial situation so she\u2019s TA as well for expecting you to be able to pivot to her new plan and then getting mad about you not eating. As if anyone  really cared.\n\nYou two might want to work on your communication. You both messed up.", "YTA\n\nYou could have ordered a small salad.\n\nWouldn't have hurt you.", "ESH. You should've told your friend you can't afford to go out to that restaurant. I've said that to my best friend before when it was for her birthday, it was expensive and it was me, hubby and our daughters.

I chalk this up to poor communication. You should have been more honest with your friend about why you declined the invitation.

I was barely scraping by and events like these felt difficult. If something was entirely out of budget, I\u2019d simply say I had a conflict or tell the truth.

Even if you don't end up ordering, you will still look more engaged. But yeah, it is a little tacky to take a seat at a restaurant and not order anything.

Should they be forced to order 2 entrees because there are 2 of them?\n\nRidiculous", "No of course, I was a server for 3 years and got pissed when people came and no one ordered anything but like1 drink for the whole group. I'm talking about times when its a big group and one person chooses not to get anything. As long as the waiter is tipped well, and the restaurant gets business, i don't see a problem with someone in a group who decides to refrain.", "Leech? Lol what? The people with them are ordering. You aren\u2019t depriving anyone of any seats because even if they weren\u2019t there it\u2019s not like you sit random people together in others tables?", "one person out a group not eating is not going to break a servers bank", "Splitting it two ways, sure.

I am very mindful when choosing restaurants bc not everyone can afford to go to a high end place at the drop of a hat. Again, its hard for someone to admit. You may not think so, but thats YOU\n\nRegardless, the friend is wrong for texting OP about how embarrassed she was, and how bad she looked. If anyone should be embarrassed, it should be OP, which she admits and now her friend is making her feel worse? Kicking her when she's already down?

And often communicating in advance can avoid the situation altogether, which is what OP should\u2019ve done in this case.", "Time and place. If you're at a pizza shop or a burger joint, sure, it's fine to pass on the food and just grab a soda and hang out or whatever. But when you're at an upscale, sit-down restaurant, it is inappropriate to not order anything. No one goes there just to hang out lol \n\nI have been in OPs situation before --either OP should order a side or salad and just have that, or they should explain to their friend why they cannot attend.", "You can determine which social conventions you want to buck when it\u2019s your own family, friends, and party. It\u2019s common courtesy to participate.", "Exactly.  The burden was on the host to fix the situation...not the guests.", "yes, like why didn't OPs \"friend\" ask if they were ok? my first thought would be, are they sick? or maybe this isn't their type of cuisine? I just feel sad that there was no concern for OP other than \"you embarrassed me\" !!!!", "My best friend has two kids and we\u2019re DINKs. I would never tell her flat out that I pick up her tab to keep their wallets a little extra padded, but I do every time. We\u2019re not making much more money than they are but we don\u2019t have two little ones and home ownership to worry about. I want her to be able to see and go out with me as much as possible, so I try to remove any possible roadblocks. Picking a fancy restaurant + then getting upset at OP for not ordering was tacky and rude. Pressuring OP to attend a dinner she said she couldn\u2019t make was tacky and rude. At least offer to foot the bill if you\u2019re going to be inconsiderate about friends\u2019 financial situations.", "yeah same. it seems weird to assume that someone else will pay for me because they suggested the dinner plans \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s absurd. The restaurant is still making money off the table. I\u2019ve joined friends at restaurants last minute and not gotten anything to eat because I wasn\u2019t hungry or had already eaten just because I wanted to see them.", "That's hardly the point, is it? You don't have to be on the brink of bankruptcy to expect decent social behaviour.", "Yet the new plans disappeared when she begged? Something clearly was up.", "I'm not gonna auto assume my friends are lying if they tell me a reason for why they can't make an event", "Not even a cocktail or a glass of wine? Yeah, they're making money off the table, but not off you. If we're thinking of the restaurant's perspective (which is the least of the matter here) then you are being a leech because you are one extra person the server is accounting for but not adding anything to the bill/tip. But that's kind of besides the point.\n\nYou're welcome to do whatever, of course. And I'm glad they were fun times. But I stand by my opinion that it is weird to go to a fancy upscale restaurant just to order a water and stare at people while they eat lol", "Same here. I'm rather aghast at the rudeness of inviting someone to an engagement dinner and then expecting them to pay their own way, especially given that the invite originally called for a presumably free dinner at the friend's home. While my experience is by no means all-inclusive, my overall impression is that pretty much all cultures have a sense of hospitality, especially when it comes to feeding guests. But, maybe not. Either way, I still fault the friend for her gross lack of sensitivity. NTA", "Oh, 100%. No one gets everything all the time. \n\nI voted ESH, because OP should have been honest, but Jane changed the plans and should have paid.", "I would also just assume they forgot about it and double booked I would hope my friends would tell me if they can\u2019t afford anything and not just jump to oh lying to me about it", "if I change the venue of an event from an at home meal to a pricey restaurant and my friend suddenly 'had something come up' I'm not gonna be obtuse enough to not realize there's an issue, either with the cost or the restaurant in particular. it's not 'assuming they're lying' it's realizing they are trying to spare  feelings by outright saying they can't attend because it cost much.", "NTA. Yes you should\u2019ve been honest about the financial situation but your friend is such an AH for making you feel shitty when you went to a fuck ton of trouble to be there for her. She sounds deplorable and I\u2019d drop her like a hot potato.  Absolutely no one eats or drinks nothing at a restaurant and her dumb ass should\u2019ve picked up on the fact that you couldn\u2019t afford it. Just imagine what she\u2019ll expect you to do for her wedding. Nope!", "Thank goodness. Someone speaking sense.", "She is absolutely a bad friend for insulting, and berating someone who is already embarrassed because they can\u2019t afford it. Jesus.", "What a nonsense. Had it really been an invitation, she wouldn't have had to pay at all herself. Her friend wanted her to come along for support and then pushed her into an expensive restaurant visit that she was supposed to pay for herself. Real invitations look differently.", "What\u2019s ESH?", "What utter bullshit.", "This deserves 1000 downvotes. You\u2019re the AH", "She should know by now that she's better off than you and realized you couldn't afford it last minute", "Frankly, I think she should paid up front and never should hav expected that you would be paying. NTA, but she sure it. Some friend!", "Nta you embarrassed yourself for your friend and she didn\u2019t have the decency to check with you,what a shit friend if I was you I would find new friends", "Regardless of financial situation, if you said \u201cno\u201d and she was pressuring you to come like that the polite thing would be to offer to pay", "You don't need to tell anyone anything about your own eating habits, and they even less have any authority to dictate how you spend your money", "I mean that was the right thing to do - not letting her guess what's happening, but it doesn't make you the AH that you didn't.", ">and made everything awkward for everyone\n\nUm... WTH are you talking about?  \"Made everything awkward\"?  Because they chose not to eat?\n\nIf someone's dining choices make you feel \"awkward\", that's YOUR problem, not theirs.", "Much like people often talk about younger kids learning things like finances and the such to set themselves up better for the future, I\u2019m a firm believer that young adults should take an interpersonal communication class. One of my favorite courses I took at college and has helped me in both my personal and professional life. Learning how to listen and talk to people is essential to a successful life.", "Maybe anecdotal for me, but honestly, it just feels kind of weird.\n\nIt shouldn't really matter, but having dinner with someone and eating dinner while someone watches you feels very different.\n\nI've met a friend for lunch before who then didn't eat anything at lunch and it's weird, and I didn't really like it lol", "Oh, OP. I'm so saddened by this comment. I'm fat, too. I feel you. But God, it's heartbreaking to see us be like \"oh, we're fat, so people should just assume we're starving ourselves.\" I've had this exact thought where I go between, \"if i eat, people will be like, hey look at that fat lard shoveling food into her mouth,\" and \"if i pick at stuff, people will think it's because I don't want to look like a fat lard.\"", "For all they know, you could have had an appointment to have your bowels X-rayed the next morning and hadn't been allowed to eat all day. Tell your stuck-up friend to go with that story if any of them ask. (Betcha nobody will.)\n\nAlso tell her, next time she _invites_ someone to a meal, it's on her. If anyone has reason to be snippy here it's you, not her.", "Well we know who the real ah's are....and it ain't OP.   OP please don't be embarrassed, your friend pressured you to come and at any time she could've pulled you aside and asked what was up.  That she went straight to anger and insults should tell you what kind of \"friend\" she is.\n\nYou should probably get better friends.", "OP should communicate, not expect her friend to know what she's thinking.", "Or she could grow a spine and be real.", "She embarrassed herself either way.", "If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how do they expect you guys to survive teaching for a year unpaid? How does one even make do?", "\u201cHey it\u2019s my birthday! Let me buy you something\u201d yeah no.", "At fancy (read ultra expensive) restaurants in the US, the tip is usually automatically added to the bill....especially at tables where there's 10 or more and in OP's case....just less one person's meal (that they couldn't afford).  The server gets that tip regardless.  She didn't inconvenience anyone.", "It\u2019s Reddit everyone expects people to be mind readers. I didn\u2019t communicate, no worries it\u2019s still their fault lol.", "it may be a matter of linguistical nuance.\n\nbut:  Do you want to come have dinner with me\n\nand:  Can I take you to dinner\n\nmeans you pay/they pay respectively.  \n\nNaturally, history of paying own way or being treated can influence perception of who pays as well as the fact that the invite may be much more nebulous than my examples.", "Or people could mind their own business.  Not eating overpriced food is not a slap in the face to anyone.", "She didn't embarrass herself by not eating.  Her friend was embarrassed.", "Yeah this is what pre-service teaching is in the US. You spend a semester or year in the classroom, full time, doing the job of at least a TA up to a teacher, and not only are you not paid, most places you're paying tuition. \n\nAbsolutely crazy.", "You get a \u00a312K student loan for the whole year and then have to try and work outside of teaching hours. It\u2019s a very stressful year where you can\u2019t afford to do anything", "Right? And she also had to drive two hours round trip. That\u2019s gas money as well. *If* I\u2019m going to call anyone the AH, it\u2019s going to be the friend for springing a sudden expense bump on everyone involved without consideration. Should OP have tried to explain that she couldn\u2019t really afford an extravagant dinner? Yeah, probably \u2014 but despite people saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with admitting you can\u2019t afford it\u201d, sometimes it *is* embarrassing and it\u2019s not so simple. And instead of saying \u201cI can\u2019t really afford to go there\u201d she tried to not go, felt pressured to go anyways, so then tried to appease her friend by going and not partaking (hoping to find a happy middle ground). Had OP been honest, would her friend have then paid? Maybe, maybe not. If the friend didn\u2019t offer to pay and just said: \u201coh, ok. Sorry you can\u2019t make it\u201d \u2014 what does that tell OP? She wants me there for her support, but not at her expense? Whether or not that\u2019s true, sometimes people overthink things. \n\nIf the friend *did* offer, now we\u2019re also talking about pride. I know in my mind I\u2019d be thinking \u201ccool, I\u2019m such a broke loser I have to accept my friend\u2019s charity on a night that\u2019s important to her just to support her.\u201d Literally a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\n\n*TO BE CLEAR*, I\u2019m not saying OP is a broke loser \u2014 I totally empathize with her situation and, I agree, there *should be* no shame in admitting you can\u2019t afford something like that \u2014 I\u2019m saying that were I in her situation, that\u2019s how *my* mind would act. I overthink stuff and stress about that kind of thing a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation, and while I won\u2019t cast judgement one way or another on the friend, to OP, I\u2019m saying NTA.", "This is such a stupid sidetrack and not at all related. It was a one time thing and there were other people who ordered plenty. Try to not be so stupid that you can\u2019t identify situations. I know it\u2019s probably hard for you.", "Growing up, even if it was a birthday/wedding/event, the expectation is you pay for your own meal. I have lived in a few states and this has always been the expectation unless explicitly stated that someone else is paying. In most instances, one of the guests covered the meal of the person being celebrated.", "I realized this escaped your attention but a lot of people.....A  LOT....are ashamed of having low/no finances...mostly because a lot of the times they were/are made to feel ashamed about not having the clothes, the cars or the better homes in the best neighborhoods, etc....ergo, a lot of the shit we who have enough, take for granted (just talking middle class here).  Soooo to protect themselves they usually keep their financial situations to themselves.  That info pretty much is given to those who are TRUSTED!  Get the point?\n\nThis isn't about being an adult.  Its about trust & empathy.  OP's statement clearly indicates this friend is not only oblivious to other's financial situations but she can't be bothered to conjure up any empathy for them either. OP told her she couldn't afford to be her bridesmaid so OP not being able to afford eating at that place never clicked? Come on!  Why would OP disclose her financial situation to this kind of person????\n\nThe least she could've done to show empathy was to not pressure OP into attending an event she couldn't afford....or offer to pay for her but girlfriend had no intentions of paying someone else's way or she would've offered immediately....or been much kinder to her the following day.", "Tf? We are double income no kids and a $100 dinner out is still absolutely a splurge for us. Not everybody has hundreds in their account to throw around and there\u2019s nothing you can do to make them magically appear.", "And you're an immoral person it seems that you can't understand that a $100 could be like 4-5 weeks of groceries for a poor person...\n\nPoint is $100 is a lot if you're poor and you sound even ridiculous even pointing at OP when OP already mentioned they're poor and couldn't afford it.", "It\u2019s likely still water, from the tap, which is typically free.", "She didn't even order a cocktail or coffee or a nice beverage. I would've been worried SICK if a friend of mine did that. The fact that her first thought was \"you embarrassed me\" is atrocious.", "Its been nice reading everyone treating their friends. Makes the world a bit better, and you know its a relief for them when you help. Hopefully OP's friend is able to learn, and that the friendship is strong enough for OP to tell her whats up.", "I mean if the person is super rich clearly a restaurant can be expensive. But the statement that being a bridesmaid and going to a restaurant are different prices ranges is generally true. If they\u2019re going to super fancy restaurants you think they\u2019re just going to slum it for things like a bachelorette party and bridesmaid dresses. I mean the bachchelorette party will likely include a dinner anyways so it\u2019s almost necessarilly more expensive than just the restaurant.  \n  \nSaying you cant afford being a bridesmaid does not imply you can\u2019t afford to go out to dinner. In this case they afford either but I can see why someone wouldn\u2019t assume that.", "\n\n>You don't have to be on the brink of bankruptcy to expect decent social behaviour\n\nit's one person  out of a group. stop being a drama queen.", "right! i feel bad for OP... I know what it feels like to realize when your friend is not really your friend...", "You may find it weird and that\u2019s fair, but who cares about what the server may think? They\u2019re still making money off the people who tip and the restaurant is making so much more.", "You are sitting here disputing the price difference between ordering at a restaurant verses being part of a wedding party. BOTH she could not afford. Yeah, she should have said it but was likely embarassed."]}
