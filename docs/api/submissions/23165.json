While I can afford my necessities I don\u2019t often have lots of fun money. With that said let\u2019s get to the situation.\n\nMy friend, let\u2019s call her Jane, just recently got engaged. Her future in-laws aren\u2019t from the same country as us so my friend had never met them in person. Well after they got engaged they came to visit and my friend decided to have an engagement dinner so the two families could meet while the parents were in town.\n\nMy friend invited me and her other friend considering we are childhood friends and have gotten super close lately. The dinner was going to be at my friends house. Well the morning of the dinner my friends AC went out and it\u2019s summer here so she picked a restaurant. She told me she wanted to make a good impression for the parents so she picked a super fancy restaurant. My heart immediately sank because I knew I simply couldn\u2019t afford this place especially with such short notice. Embarrassed(my friend has always been well off.) by my financial situation I told her that something came up and I wasn\u2019t able to make it tonight. She went quiet on the phone and then began to beg me to come. She said it would mean a lot and help her feel less nervous. Feeling bad I agreed to come. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole. I got dressed up and drove the hour into the city to the restaurant. When I got there I sat next to my friend  and was directly across from the future MIL. When the waitress gave everyone their menus I didn\u2019t pick mine up and just made small talk with people at the table until it came time to order. Everyone ordered their food with whatever fancy drink. When it came to me I just shook my head and said \u201cjust water please, thank\u201d and smiled. Everyone immediately looked uncomfortable and the waitress asked if I was sure which did make me feel a little embarrassed and said yes before looking at my friend for her to order. I sat at the table and continued in small talk. \n\nI thought the night went well. Nobody mentioned I wasn\u2019t eating or seemed to care besides that brief moment. I thought all was good until the next day my friend texted me saying that what I did was embarrassing, tacky, and made her look bad in front of her In-laws. So now I feel bad. I didn\u2019t think it would be embarrassing for her. I figured if anyone would be embarrassed it would be me. So I don\u2019t know. I wanted to support my friend but I should have been honest about why I originally couldn\u2019t come and not have gone.", "created_utc": 1690366670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a1q4s/aita_for_not_ordering_anything_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should have discreetly said, \u201cthis one is on me\u201d and made sure her friend who drove an hour ate and drank at her event. You\u2019re a good friend for not ordering and sticking someone else with the bill but still attending. Personally I would have been embarrassed with myself if I let my friend go hungry and thirsty at an event I had pressured them to attend.\n\nEdit: Pressured > invited", "Tough one. I think I'm going with NTA but you should've communicated better. You should've said you couldn't afford it and won't be eating but will join them. Given she initially invited you to dinner, I think she should've offered to pay for your meal.", "You should have just told your friend you can\u2019t afford it. People acting like the friend is a bad person saying they forced OP to go to somewhere they couldn\u2019t afford, but the friend literally had no idea and just thought their friend was bailing on them last second. I think not eating just comes across as super weird. You need to be the one to communicate issues it\u2019s not on your friend.\n\nEdit for clarity: I don\u2019t really think anyone is an AH I think OP just needs to communicate the real reason behind it", "NAH... this seems to be just bad communication. Does she really know how much you can afford? \n\nYou could have just said, i am sorry but that is way to expensive for me. I do that all the time when my \"rich\" friends ask me to go out. Sometimes they invite me if they really want to go or we choose somethign else.\n\nGoing to a restaurant where everyone is eating but you jsut drink water... yeah that is super weird and a bit rude.\n\nYour friends reaction afterwards was also rude. She could have asked why you didn't eat anything instead of attacking.\n\nBut all of that comes down to: Get a spine, and tell people if you cannot afford something ;)", "NAH you should have informed her beforehand that you couldn't afford to eat there and that's why you wouldn't be able to go. Instead you lied and didn't communicate. If she had known she could have either offered to pay for you or accepted your decline if the invitation.", "Info:  were you expected to contribute to the bill or was your friend paying?", "NTA\n\nNobody has brought it up, I wouldn't worry overmuch. Your friend lacks social-awareness. Might be worth straight up telling her in the future what you told us here:\n\n>My heart immediately sank because I knew I simply couldn\u2019t afford this place especially with such short notice.\n\nIt likely never occurred to her until you ordered water that this was the case. People born to wealth often have no concept of budgeting or having to choose between food or rent. Honesty might have either got you an out on attending or (if your friend has any sense of propriety) a meal comp'd by your friend, as she was asking you to put yourself out by traveling into town as a favor.", "Did you tell her you couldn't afford it? Like beforehand?", "I don't understand how you use the word friend. Sounds like an acquaintance.", "NTA but this could've been avoided by honest communication with your friend. Even if she was oblivious. But why didn't she ask why you didn't order anything? She knows you don't have the money at the moment,  don't she?", "NTA.\n\nYou told your friend the restaurant was out of your budget. You agreed to drive all the way to the restaurant just to support your friend. Your friend is the AH for not appreciating your presence and giving you a gentle way out (e.g. telling you it's okay not to come and that she'll do something with you later).", "I would be interested in how many there wee at this dinner , and did everybody get separate checks, ?   It is tough on friendship when the money is unequal.  Even if the friend wanted to pay for hers, sometimes that doesnt always turn out right, and ends up here instead", "NTA. You have stated to your friend several times that you don\u2019t have the money and they are picking outings that require money. You have tried to decline and they guilt you. What else can you do in this situation? In college, my roommates and I had one roommate with NO money. Every cent he made went towards tuition and fees. We didn\u2019t want to leave him out though, so we took him to Olive Garden. It was great. One of us would order a soup (that nice gnocchi one), the others would order salad and extra breadsticks. He ate like a king for free and we still got to enjoy our time with him. Real friends make it work.", "NTA if I change where my dinner was being hosted going from a meal that was provided to a restaurant that you had to pay for I would be offering to pay the bill as I grew up low income and now not all can afford and now I am fortunate enough to have a fantastic partner who makes great money and I have a great job as well. Sorry your friend doesn\u2019t understand.", "What a shi**y friend you got. She probably knows everything about your financial situation and still begged you to come. She should had ordered something for you like a cheap salad or side dish instead of sitting there and acting dumb. Then she blames you for embarrassing her ?? You are a good friend who went beyond your way to support your friend even though you couldn\u2019t afford food. \n\nIf I were you I would rethink this friendship especially because your friend is \u201cwell off\u201d and didn\u2019t order some cheap thing for you. She INVITED you to a fancy restaurant then she can also pay for you. Prepare yourself for her bachelorette party and the cost of being a bridesmaid to \u2018this\u2019 friend, she will expect you to pay for things you can\u2019t afford.", "NTA, I\u2019ve done the same before and to be honest it\u2019s just better to tell the truth. It\u2019s embarrassing but if they are a good friend, they will understand (or possibly cover you). \n\nI found out at the end of the meal it was all paid for by the host, and they thought it was so strange I didn\u2019t eat\u2026 it was super awkward and just not ideal.", "NTA, your friend is oblivious and shouldn't have expected you to go to some expensive restaurant to impress her family. You can't spend money you don't have.", "NTA. Usually, the people having the engagement party pay for their guests, so it's strange that she didn't (even if it was relocated.) And she's the one who begged you to come when you said you couldn't go. Not sure why you just didn't tell her you were low on funds right now, but that still doesn't make you the a\\*\\*hole. She could have assumed you weren't feeling well or maybe you were fasting (I do this twice a week, cuz it's part of my regime.) Anyway, your friend is TA for calling you out and saying you embarrassed her. I don't even understand why she'd think that, cuz it doesn't make sense. She's your friend and she should have at least known you had good reason even if you didn't say what it was.", "NTA - If you were my friend, and i begged you to come, and you didnt order anything. You bet i would've discreetly texted you that i'd cover whatever you had. \n\nYou should've said you didnt have the budget to your friend tho, so she could've known ahead of time. These things happen, move on and tell your friend it was unfortunate you didn't mention it ahead of time.", "NTA\n\nIf you invite someone to dinner, esp pressuring them, youre the host and should be ready to pay for it. Thats how my friends and I do it.\n\nHowever, you could have spoken up a bit about your concern. Close friends can share that kind of info.", "Why is OP expected to pay when attending for her friend. NTA. Your friend should have offered to pay beforehand since it\u2019s her dinner with her people.", " Wow. Your friend sucks. NTA.", "NTA. Friends dont let friends go hungry.", "NTA. A friend of mine recently got engaged and wanted all of her bridesmaids to get together for lunch so we could all meet eachother. She chose a restaurant for all of us to meet at and I knew I wouldn't like anything on the menu so I ate beforehand. She chose a spicy Mexican restaurant. I cant even handle pepper on anything let alone actual spicy stuff. I told everyone in the group chat I would eat beforehand. All I ordered was a pepsi to drink. And we all had a great time! My friend was completely understanding of my situation too", "NTA. \n\nBut I'm confused why you weren't honest with your supposed friend. She would have understood if you didn't want to go, or would have offered to pay. If she wouldn't, then she's not a friend!", "NTA\n\nWhile it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business what your financial situation is, I think it would have been a wise move to be up front and simply say, \u201cI can\u2019t go there tonight. I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t have it in my budget at the moment. I hope you have a great night!\u201d", "You should have been honest, but NTA.\n\nIsn't it proper socially that when you invite someone out that you would cover the cost of their meal? You didn't have the money to spend and you gave a fair reason to not be there but she still begged you to come. I would communicate clearer with your friend in the future to avoid situations like these.", "ESH but very soft YTA\n\nAdmitting financial struggles is always embarrassing. And from what I gather from your comments, your friend is aware of the fact that you are experiencing them. If she were a good friend she would have acknowledged it and offered to pay for your meal, ESPECIALLY given the fact that it was her celebration. \n\nSoft YTA though for not communicating better and putting your foot down. Maybe next time try saying 'I'm going through a tough time financially right now and while I would love to be there and support you I just don't have the means, I hope you understand.' \n\nNot everyone is well off or made of money and that's okay. If you have a job and are a hard worker, there's nothing to be ashamed of OP. People who do have money and don't understand or care about other people's struggles are major AH.", "ESH \n\nBut more so on the friends side for being oblivious\n\nWhere you went wrong as you recognised is just not being honest with her, you should have told her you would love to go but you really can\u2019t afford it.", "NTA\n\n Inviting people to restaurants and making them pay was even tackier than that. I'm sure that's what made her look bad in fron of her in laws.", "YTA yes you should have told your friend the truth and yes you made it awkward for everyone by not ordering anything", "Anyone saying ESH or YTA has likely never experienced poverty, and should kindly (or unkindly) f off.\n\nOP, NTA. I've been in your situation before, it's rough and demoralizing. Don't be afraid to tell people ehy you can't participate, but certainly don't ever feel bad for not. Poverty is a vicious cycle.", "NTA , your friend picked a pricey fancy restaurant to \"impress\" her MIL , begs U for coming and then U basically have to waste your money for stupid fancy shit. ( tbh I'm very anti capitalistic and having worked in restaurants a lot, those things are often just a rip off). Yes you should have been more transparent maybe and actually I would be questioning my friendship if I can't even be open with my problems. But you drove 2 hours for her and U did accompany her in the end.  Might be a cultural thing but in my country (Austria) it's not such a big fuss if one in the group simply doesn't want to drink .", "NTA. She invited you, basically emotionally blackmailed you into coming, she should be footing the bill. \n\nIt made her look bad, because that\u2019s how she acted.", "YTA. You\u2019re 23 communicate like it. If you can\u2019t afford something tell the person inviting you upfront next time. Are financial problems embarrassing? They shouldn\u2019t be but I could see why you\u2019d be embarrassed. Just explain your situation next time. \n\nYou\u2019re a good friend for wanting to support her but if you can\u2019t afford going out and know it, then don\u2019t. How awkward a dinner it was with everyone eating and chatting then you just drinking a water. I don\u2019t understand the other votes and comments, your friend didn\u2019t force you to go out. \n\nEveryone yelling \u201cshe should\u2019ve payed she invited you!\u201d It was an engagement dinner, what wedding couple pays for their own engagement dinner? And how was the friend supposed to know she needed to pay for OP if she didn\u2019t communicate this with her?\n\nPeople with money are awful at knowing when they are around poor people. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t already shared that information with your friend beforehand for outings.", "Soft YTA\n\nSorry.. But a simple \"I can't afford it\" May have given your friend a chance to either offer to pay for you or allowed her to understand why you were skipping the event at the very least.", "YTA \n\nYou should have been honest with your friend and simply said, \"I'm really sorry I just can't afford to go to X tonight, I hope you have an amazing time\" \n\n\nGoing to a restaurant with a group of people and not ordering anything is very odd", "NTA, maybe should have told your friend you couldnt afford it so not well handled but not the asshole", "NTA. It would be best to tell your friend outright that you are too broke to go out to dinner, but you did what you could think of at the time, and probably would have felt too embarrassed to say anything like that. Going forward, if she wants you for a friend she should step up and consider that your circumstances are different than hers. After you have told her one time that you do not have much money and this isn't going to change in the near future, she should not put you on the spot to have to tell her this again.", "It\u2019s a bit weird to not get anything at a restaurant and makes for an awkward situation for everyone involved. Where I live, it is also considered rude towards the restaurant, as you\u2019re getting serviced and taking up a spot. I understand your predicament though. \n\nYou probably should have been honest with your friend about not being able to afford that restaurant. If I were your friend, I would have offered to pay for you, as I was the one who sprung it on you with such short notice.", "I would say slight YTA. I see both sides, but I think it\u2019s more your fault bc I think it was on you to tell her that you couldn\u2019t afford it \u2014 she may have some general idea of your financial situation (ie knows you\u2019re not well off or knows you can\u2019t afford to be a bridesmaid), but maybe wouldn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t afford a dinner \u2014 maybe the cheapest thing on the menu would\u2019ve been affordable, idk. She\u2019s also planning a wedding so maybe it wasn\u2019t at the forefront of her mind.", "NTA you don't have to eat if you don't want to. Sounds like she is just stressing out about her MIL and directing it at you", "YTA. All you had to do was say to your friend \u201cI can\u2019t afford to eat out, I\u2019ll schedule time to meet the family away from the restaurant\u201d", "Soft YTA.  She\u2019s oblivious but you should have been honest.  You had the courage to turn down being a bridesmaid so just stick with this \u201eI am on a budget\u201c theme and eventually it may sink in.  You may want to apologize to her for how you handled it and for embarrassing her.  It\u2019s a way to heal things but also set boundaries so she stops asking you to do expensive things.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, however it may be a huge etiquette thing. It is out the ordinary for people to come to restaurants with groups of people and not eat, even if it\u2019s something small. Everyone was probably thinking the same thing and I\u2019m sure there was some talk after about what was going on. Ultimately the lack of communication and honesty has caused a riff. I think if you were honest about why you couldn\u2019t go, the situation would have turned out differently. All friendships are different, but when my friends say they can\u2019t do something because they don\u2019t have money, I\u2019m paying regardless and don\u2019t worry about paying me back because that\u2019s what true friends do!", "ESH because you can't go to a restaurant and not eat. The restaurant has costs too.\n\nYour friend should have paid for you, though.", "YTA for not just being honest with your friend. \n\n I\u2019m assuming she knows your financial situation so she\u2019s TA as well for expecting you to be able to pivot to her new plan and then getting mad about you not eating. As if anyone  really cared.\n\nYou two might want to work on your communication. You both messed up.", "YTA\n\nYou could have ordered a small salad.\n\nWouldn't have hurt you.", "ESH. You should've told your friend you can't afford to go out to that restaurant. I've said that to my best friend before when it was for her birthday, it was expensive and it was me, hubby and our daughters.

I chalk this up to poor communication. You should have been more honest with your friend about why you declined the invitation.

I was barely scraping by and events like these felt difficult. If something was entirely out of budget, I\u2019d simply say I had a conflict or tell the truth.

It was a dinner where op went only to support friend.", ">It's not odd for someone to pay for their own meal \n\n It is when you invite that someone and especially when it's to help you, like in this case. \n\n>She \"begged\" her to come\n\nI don't know why you use air quotes, she did beg op to go. \n\n> should have said she couldn't afford it, the host might have happily paid for her meal\n\nThe host asked op to go to dinner there to help her during dinner. It's common sense that she should've paid, since op was there only to make her a favour. Duh", "You directly contradict yourself in your comment. First you say there were at least ppl, then you say it's not like they didn't force a bigger table like an 8 not 6. As someone who has worked in restaurants for 20 yrs, they were assholes to the establishment.", "That's an awful and selfish attitude to have  and you'd feel differently if you ran a business.\n\nPersonally, I think it's common courtesy to actually spend money in a restaurant. You're not just paying for the food.", "Fasting here is super popular", "Calling OP tacky is what makes her an AH.", "When I insist someone goes to a place with me, I pick up the tab automatically. If they don\u2019t want me to, they can treat me later, it\u2019ll all work out in the end. If we agree to go together, then I assume we\u2019ll split or at least that one of us will Venmo the other. \n\nIn this case, if we made plans together and then someone said they couldn\u2019t make it after I changed the plans to something more expensive, and I insisted they come, I\u2019d be ready to pick up their bill and I\u2019d let them know it\u2019s on me (which also gives them the chance to say, \u201cno no, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d or \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that\u201d).", "The friend is an asshole. After OP tried to politely get out of going (since she agreed to a dinner party, not a restaurant), then ordered nothing, the friend should have discreetly pulled her aside and asked. The friend knows she's not got a lot of disposable income and picked an expensive restaurant, she had more than enough cues to take 5 minutes to notice OP had a problem and take 5 minutes to make up an excuse to leave the table with her and ask her about it.\n\nSince she didn't she could at least think back and acknowledge OP was doing the best she could and not attack her for it.", "I've pissed some people off by offering to pay when we went out knowing they were not doing great financially, and basically they were pissed I thought they were broke", "OP didn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want to go she said something else came up which would also be an AH thing to do because it looks like they made different plans knowing they already had plans. Friend would be an AH if OP said I can\u2019t afford it and friend still forced them to go, but that\u2019s not what happened", "So for her, spending money on a fancy dinner means she has to forgo other luxuries. For you, it means not being able to pay rent or other important bills. It's two different lifestyles. She's hurt that you wouldn't budget luxuries in order to have dinner, but that isn't your reality. You wouldn't miss paying your power bill in order to have dinner. \n\nYou're not an AH, but if you value this friendship, be open and honest about your financial situation. Without begrudging her for hers. Sometimes you will have to decline invitations because it's out of your price range, and she can either cover you, choose something else, or go without you.", "Then tell her when you can't afford something, instead of bailing last second with a shitty excuse or not saying anything and being awkward as fuck during the dinner. She can't look into your bank account, it's on you to just tell her that you just can't afford it so you can't come. You're an adult, act like one.", "Or to super poor people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFive dollars isn't a lot of money. Unless you only have five dollars. Then it's everything.", "What a ridiculous response.  Dinner for just you is 100$ max?, bridesmaid for this extravagant travel wedding sounds like at least 500-1000?", "Well then .. she did actually say U r too broke to be her bridesmaid. Because the only logical thing would have been to say \" I totally understand that but if U have a hard time atm will cover the costs for coming to our wedding for U because I value our friendship and U being there for me more than some stupid dollars.\" \n\nAgain this might be a cultural difference as I often don't understand Americans but it doesn't seem to be such a good friendship from her side from your point of view. I sincerely hope U have real friends too.", "I agree the friend was clueless in all this, but OP could just have been honest as well. This was all just obvious miscommunication. Also my judgement is NAH. Clear communication saves lives.", "There were at least 8 people. That means an 8 top or 10 top, depending on what the restaurant has. Most restaurants have more 2, 4 or 6 seat tables than larger ones.\n\n7 people at an 8 top with one person not buying anything takes up a bigger table that could have had 7 or 8 paying customers rather than a 6 top if OP stayed home. 8 people at an 8 top with 7 paying customers or 7 paying customers in total is the same thing to the restaurant, it's 7 meals at a suitable table size. Not 6 meals at a table that could fit a bigger group plus 6 meals at a 6 top.", "Agree to disagree. I don't expect anyone to pay for my meal and i shouldn't.\n\nEven if the other person \"insisted\".\n\nI guess that is just a cultural thing. In the end this whole thing could have been avoided if OP just said \"Sorry that is too expensive for me.\". Doesn't make anyone an asshole anyway. Who knows. Maybe her friend would have payed if she knew just how tight mone for OP actually is. Which she apparantly does not.", "Yeah it is a touchy subject. But should not be between friends this good.", "Uh no, if someone told me something came up and they couldn\u2019t make it to our plans my initial thought isn\u2019t \u201coh they made plans over our plans\u201d no my first thought is \u201comg are you okay? Lmk if you need anything and hope everything\u2019s alright\u201d she tried to be discreet and not attend and OPs friend backed her into a corner. \n\nAs her friend, if she even cared about her, she would know OP couldn\u2019t afford that specific restaurant, my close friends and I would never put each other in this position or assume others can afford such an expensive meal without even asking first INCLUDING a wedding event. She herself even said she only chose it to impress her in laws which goes to show she would never normally choose it because of how expensive/fancy it is. So no op is in no way the AH, yeah she should\u2019ve communicated a little better the reason why, but she is not the AH \n\nHer friend is forgoing off on her and calling her tacky when OP only went to support the damn girl", "You\u2019ve obviously never been poor enough to understand this so maybe just accept what OP is telling you about their personal situation, on which they are the expert, not you. \n\nAlso, dinner at a fancy restaurant depending on cuisine and location could easily be more than $100.", "This is a weird take. OP can attend the wedding without being a bridesmaid and we have no evidence her friend can afford to cover all the various bridesmaid costs for her. Weddings are expensive and I think graciously accepting that OP can\u2019t be a bridesmaid is enough there", "I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re getting downvoted, I agree with you. I am the best off of all my friends and when I got married I covered the bill for a lot of stuff because I just wanted to celebrate with the people who were important to me and I didn\u2019t want money (which I am lucky to have enough of) to be the reason they couldn\u2019t be there.", "Exactly. I didn\u2019t have anything fancy for my wedding (except the wedding, which was pretty affordable and down to earth) because I knew I was asking A LOT for my bridesmaids to just come out to it (not a destination wedding, I just moved across the country after grad school).", "You shouldn't be getting downvoted, I've been in the same situation as OP and my friend made it so that I could be in the bridal party. The people come first in a wedding, so the outings (dress shopping, parties, etc) should be designed around the people you want with you. Very weird attitude to ditch friends in these situations imo.", "Well, if a friend who\u2019s supposed to be close doesn\u2019t know her friend\u2019s financial situation then she\u2019s not much of a friend.\n\nHad a friend like that, she knew my situation at the time yet insisted that I come to some gathering and bring presents?! I didn\u2019t argue just didn\u2019t go and didn\u2019t talk to her ever again.", "I mean in one case for me it was like a 5th or 6th date, and I knew the place I suggested was more expensive than he usually was willing to eat at (it's my favorite bar, but they are very much a $20-30/person without drinking type of restaurant, and he tends to stick to $10 or less/person type of places). Yeah the fact they are really close friends does change it a bit, but I've also never had a close friend who was drastically different ability to go out to eat, because like in high school we were all broke, in college we basically just all ate in the dining hall, and since college most of my CLOSE friends are doing similarly to me", "I'm currently poor and grew up poor so I'm not sure what you're talking about.  And let's say they ordered a side and drink just to order something,  that's not 100 even with tip.", "I was just educating myself about what the chores of a bridesmaid are and seemingly they should cover a lot of costs ? Man I'm sorry but in my opinion it's just so dam fucked up system to drain money out of everyone at a marriage."]}
