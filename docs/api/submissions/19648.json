I ended up running into him recently as well, this is a long time after I\u2019d seen him last, and he stopped me after recognizing me on the street. Nice guy, we had a nice talk. He doesn\u2019t seem to be all there mentally and I\u2019m glad I could have helped him, regardless of what others have to say about it.", "NAH. You were sweet and did nothing wrong. Was Jenna upset? My feelings may be slightly hurt if I saw someone give away a present my parents gave, but at the same time should realize fairly quickly you were just being nice and it was nothing personal", "NTA. You were gifted the blanket which means you're the owner of the item and you can choose what to do with it and you did the right thing", "NTA", "NTA . Though it was gifted to you it became righty yours to decide what to do with it . You went beyond for the person in need  by selecting the least used . Not only that you treat this individual as a person and didn't look over them like most would. You did good OP", "NTA, I would be so happy if a gift I had given someone was used by that person to help someone else who needed it more."]}
