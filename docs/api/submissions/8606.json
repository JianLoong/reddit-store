I had declined and said I did not feel comfortable with that period of time, especially given my eldest is starting school this year and all 5 of the weeks would be in school term. But the primary reason is I haven\u2019t gone longer then 10 days without them and that was huge. So 35 days would be a life time, for me and them. I explained that given their ages, I felt like 2 weeks was a fair period of time at the moment. \n\nI have recently asked to have the girls on a 9 day block to go on a cruise for my birthday. I had previously asked if this was ok and got the green light, pending dates working out. My ex has then tried to negotiate the approval of my holiday for hers. She has offered to shorten the trip to 4 weeks. I have stayed strong by what I think is best for the girls at this age and said I don\u2019t feel anything longer then 2 weeks is Reasonable at this age. \n\nAgain, this has lead to the ultimatum of I succumb to letting them go for the 4 weeks or I\u2019m not allowed to take them on a holiday for 9 days. I have explained that this is the kids missing out etc but it doesn\u2019t get anywhere. \n\nMy question is, am I being reasonable? I feel as though I am being reasonable with not allowing that length of time but she is now accusing me of preventing the kids from experiences and blaming me for them missing out on the cruise too. I have reiterated that I\u2019m fine with them going anywhere in the world for 2 weeks but 4 is just too long. \n\n I feel like I\u2019m going crazy sometimes and need some clarity from outside perspectives. \n\nThanks!", "created_utc": 1674988861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o4we5/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_kids_holiday/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are completely being reasonable - 4 week holiday for a 5 and 3 y/o? Better to save the money for a long holiday like that when they are older, or when it is not school time. 2 weeks is plenty.", "NTA\n\n4 weeks of holiday at those ages don't build that much memories just yet. Better do it when they are older anyway.\n\nAnd\n\n> all 5 of the weeks would be in school term\n\nHow is this even considered?", "NTA, you need to get a proper custody agreement. I don\u2019t think anyone neutral would rule in favour of taking a child out of school for four weeks just for a random holiday, even without the complication of not seeing their parent.", "NTA. You\u2019re being responsible by prioritizing your kids. It is pretty reckless to use 5 weeks during a school term for a holiday. You\u2019re being fair by suggesting two weeks as it gives the kids a reasonable period to be away from school with a parent. 5 weeks is ridiculous honestly. You\u2019re being a good parent here", "NTA - I wouldn't want to take such young children away from their routines for 5 weeks. They won't enjoy being dragged around as tourists for days on end, and won't even remember most of it. The fact that all 5 weeks are also school weeks, makes it an even bigger no.\n\nNot wanting to miss your child for 5 weeks may be a tiny bit selfish, but given what they would be doing for those 5 weeks, it doesn't make you TA.", "Absolutely NTA. You are being quite reasonable, 4-5 weeks during school year is a lot. Try to make a compromise with your ex wife though, so your girls don\u2019t miss out. Maybe agree to 3 weeks (which is still plenty), in return for having them for the cruise.", "ESH  \n\n\nAs a mom who had to co parent with dad, its hard working out times for each side. That said, what you're asking for is not unreasonable. However, what she is asking for is not completely unreasonable either. Your kids are only 5 and 3. While school is important yes, this are very YOUNG children. Who won't miss much school wise. If they'll even remember the trip as they get much older. I barely remember being 5 now..lol I think you should let mom have the girls for this trip, it is also about spending time with them. You'll get the cruise you wanted. And make an agreement with mom, no more trips during school time after the first year in. It's a compromise to both of you digging in your heels and only the girls are hurt.", "Tell her you are happy for her to have the kids that long in the school holidays but not take them out of school. \n\nFor the duration of the holiday - you are putting your desires and needs above they kids. YOU can\u2019t be without them for 4 weeks\u2026. YOU. They really might enjoy spending full weeks with their mom.", "Can you compromise? Allow the vacation outside of school?", "(I don't know anything about the mother) Just based on the post YTA. I get that 5 weeks is a long time and you don't like it, but you basically said \"your not allowed to take them on vacation but i want to take them on vacation\" \n\nDo you fear for the kids' safety? Is the mother going to try and run with the kids? \n\nThere's gotta be a better reason than you don't want to be apart from the kids that long", "How exactly is not going on this trip in the children's best interest? Other than missing a bit of school which, at 5 years old, isn't exactly going to be hard to catch up to? You both apparently want to have flexibility in the schedule.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Again, this has lead to the ultimatum of I succumb to letting them go for the 4 weeks or I\u2019m not allowed to take them on a holiday for 9 days.\" ...

Both are reasonable stances.

She wants to take them out of school and away from their other parent for a month! There should be something in you custody order about how these conflicts get resolved; if not, you probably will need to go back to court to have a system determined.", "NTA. You are a good dad.", "NTA. 5 weeks away from one parent isn't appropriate, but 5 weeks out of school is also really inappropriate. Kindergarten is such an important year. I'm hoping that the 9-day cruise you are planning on taking the kids on isn't during school, as well. If you both are planning these elaborate vacations during school time, you're doing your school aged child a disservice.", "ESH  \n\n\n>But the primary reason is I haven\u2019t gone longer then 10 days without them\n\nYou are the parent, which means you put opportunities for your kids above your feelings of missing them. You lied about the reason because you know your reason is not centering their needs. 5 weeks out of school is a lot, I do understand that as a concern depending on the consideration being put into adjusting and meeting educational needs. Your ex is being an AH by bargaining with trips.", "No wonder she is a ex.. What a horrible woman.. Despicable. NTA.", "NTA\n\nDoes she really want to drag 2 very young children around for 5 weeks? Holidays unsettle kids.\n\nI think it's irresponsible to take them for 5 weeks in term, that's half a term. I don't understand why 2 or even 3 weeks wouldn't do. If she wants to go by fairness then she can have 9 days too.", "INFO: is this a holiday holiday or a visit to see family that is overseas?", "\"School\" is not a good reason for a 5-yr old to miss something like this.", "\"Maybe agree to 3 weeks (which is still plenty), in return for having them for the cruise.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis would be \"OFFER\", not \"AGREE\" ... the ex would need to agree, too.", "Yea, let\u2019s just make the 5 year old have to repeat kindergarten for no other reason then she went on holiday for a month.", "Did you not read the post? The OP said it would be huge for the both of them. I didn\u2019t read anything about it being about his feelings alone. And 5 weeks for a 5 & 3 year old to be away from either parent is too long. \n\nThe OP is being completely reasonable agreeing to a reasonable timeframe of 2 weeks. If the OP is from Australia, our only school holiday break that is longer than 2 weeks is over Christmas.", "Hey, \n\nI\u2019m in Australia, so the only time we are able to have a holiday of longer then 2 weeks is over our Christmas period, where we get 6 weeks school holiday. She has stated that these dates are specific.", "Did you read the post? At all? He never said they couldn\u2019t go. He said they couldn\u2019t go for 5 weeks out of the country because the oldest has school. He said 2 weeks was a good compromise and it is. And op has already said in other comments that that his ex was the one who told him the kids had a hard time being away from him so long. So idk what you\u2019re trying to get at but op is not wrong. He wants to take the kids on vacation for 9 days for his bday. She wants to take the kids for a month out of the country while school is going. The two don\u2019t compare.", "You do know that missing a month of school can negatively impact the kid and she runs the chance of having to repeat kindergarten not because she can\u2019t catch up but because she misses too many days.", "Hey, I can see how it read that way. To be clear, I did not withhold that information. I informed the ex that my main concern was the time frame away and how that would affect me and the girls. When we had the 10 days apart, she was actually the one who commented on how it negatively affected them. Hence my worries at 30 odd days apart. I\u2019m not just taking my own feelings into account here but also those of the kids. Again, I can see how it read that way though and probably could have expressed that back story.", "Sure, semantics. If we are going to go there though, he would also need to agree to that, since it is a suggestion from me to him. \n\nSo first he needs to agree, then to offer, then she would need to agree as well, hence \u201cagree\u201d.", "Don't be so melodramatic. She won't be held back in Kindergarten because of one month. Are you worried she'll miss Algebra?", "Is legal for her to miss that much school in your area once she has formerly enrolled?", "Well it's not like you just disappear and don't tell the school. You coordinate with the school. Like, if OP mentioned that the school intends to hold the kid back if they miss that much time, that would be a different story.", "I get what you are saying and glad you didn't lie, but you are still talking about how it would affect you.\n\nI can see why the other reasons might be fair, but you missing your kids shouldn't be a deciding factor. I just hope that as you continue to parent, you let them have opportunities and don't hold them back from life because of your feelings.", "\"agreeing\" to an offer that is not even on the table? That's twisting the facts.", "No? the kid needs an education. And kindergarten is the first stepping stone into it. I\u2019m not being melodramatic. My own kid got held back because he missed too many days during covid. op says they live in Australia, who knows the laws about school for the children there but I\u2019m sure taking a school age child out of school for almost a month and half is detrimental to their academic career. I\u2019m also a teacher. So yea, the kid could get held back. In a lot of places you can\u2019t even miss more than 10 days. Seems to me the dad is trying to coparent effectively and the mom is the one who wants it all her way.", "I actually don\u2019t know the legality of it from an education standpoint. Maybe that is something I should look into to assist in decision making. Thanks", "Yes, it is.", "Nah it\u2019s exactly like that. You don\u2019t show up then you\u2019re absent unless you\u2019re sick, had an appt, etc. you can\u2019t just go on a holiday during the school year and expect the school to be okay with it. The ex wife could potentially get fined, brought to court for truancy, have her kid held back all because she wanted a 5 week vacation instead of 2. Schools don\u2019t care why you don\u2019t show up, they just know that you don\u2019t. And at the end of the day it could be on OP too because he\u2019s their parent as well.", "Thanks for the insight. I did mention how this had previously negatively affected them though. It\u2019s not all self centred. I have never prevented them from doing anything. This is the first time due to the length of the request.", "Depends on the school.\n\nFor some private schools it's \"if you do this don't bother coming back.  We are not going to invest the time in educating your kids if you can't be bothered to make the same commitment.\"\n\nI'm not sure about the public system.\n\nHowever, OP, my sibling took their child out of school to go around Australia for a semester and, despite home schooling, it took them a couple of years to catch-up.\n\nPlease don't allow this even if it means they miss the cruise.  In fact, you should have a blanket rule of \"no school is to to be missed for holidays.\"\n\nAlso you don't want to negotiate with terrorists.  If Mum is allowed to do this then she will return to these tactics in the future.\n\nNTA.", "Definitely look into it. In the UK at least, parents can be fined for taking children out of school in term time by local government. I have read a post in the LegalAdviceUK sub where a father was held equally liable for the school fine when his ex took his kid on holiday during term time. \n\nIt's important to check your local laws and factor these in."]}
