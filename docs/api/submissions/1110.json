I had moved out for a few months and recently moved back in because of relationship issues. Ever since I moved back in my sister has made it known that this is her room and hers alone, even though we share it now. Recently, over the past few months, she has been leaving a mess in the room. In one incident, while she was on her period, she left her period soaked underwear with the pad on the floor. My boyfriend was coming over, so I asked her to pick it up. She ignored me and continued sitting on her bed. I then asked her again multiple times, telling her that no one wants to see that. She tells me that shes waiting for it to dry. I tell her to put it in the garage to dry and that I just dont want it on the floor. she replies \"if you want it picked up so bad why dont you pick it up yourself?\" I tell her that it isnt mine and that I'm not going to pick it up. my sister says \"exactly it isnt yours, so stop worrying about it\" I then tell her that it's our room and I dont want it there, she argues that it isnt our room its hers and she can do whatever she wants.\n\n In another incident she ate McDonalds in the room, she had left sauce packets on the floor. I told her to clean her mess, she told me she would do it later. Two days later she accidentally steps on a buffalo packet, it gets all ovr the carpet. I told her to clean it and she began stalling. I ended up cleaning it from the carpet 4 days later, it's now stained in the carpet. \n\nThe most recent incident with the plate, she was eating in our room, I make sure to tell her to throw away her mess when shes done. I remind her 3 times and she yells at me \"ok I heard you the the first time you dont need to keep telling me\". I end up falling asleep before her and wake up to her gone at work, the plate on the floor. I text her and tell her that she didnt pick it up and that she shouldve thrown the trash when I told her to. I end up throwing the plate away because I dont want roaches in our room. When she comes home she tells me \"i cant believe you texted at work because of a plate\" I tell her \"I told you multiple times and you still didnt do it\" she then tells me \"if you want it picked up, then you should pick it up\" when she says that, I begin to go off on her. I tell her that shes lazy and dirty, that shes the reason that roaches show up in our room, I say that I'm not her maid and she adult enough to pick it up. I tell her that when she moves out her house is going to be infested with pest. I tell her that I woyldnt have a problem with her if she just picked up her mess and that it's disgusting.

What might work is, instead of picking up after her, putting all the stuff she leaves on the floor directly on her bed. The underwear on the floor? Straight in the trash, underwear with pad and all. Do think some things through, depending on who she is, might retaliate by trashing your stuff since it\u2019s in the same room. But also\u2026 it sounds like you\u2019re sharing a room in your parents house? Have you mentioned to them what\u2019s going on? Do they not care about sauce in the carpet for days?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
