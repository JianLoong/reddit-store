The attendees included \\~100 students, the 6th grade teachers, and a handful of parent and staff volunteers. \n\nTwo of the sixth-graders were a pair of twin sisters, whom I'll call Maddie and Katie. The girls are both average height for their age (5'0), but their build differs by quite a bit. Maddie is \\~ average sized (90-95 lbs), while Katie is a little heavy (115-120 lbs). The girls' mother was also in attendance.\n\nEveryone was having a great time, but when food was served, tension started to rise. The twins' mother kept commenting about Katie's eating habits. First she said, \"No, don't eat the whole cupcake. Cut it in half.\" Katie did as her mother requested, and when she started to eat the remaining half of the cupcake, her mom immediately told her to wipe off the icing first. Maddie was permitted to eat a whole cupcake with all the icing, without their mother saying anything.\n\nThen a while later, when the twins went with a group of friends to get pizza, the twins' mother said to Katie in a rather loud whisper, \"You're getting ANOTHER slice of pizza?\" After that, when the kids were getting potato salad, the twins' mother walked over & tried to take the serving spoon away from Katie. \n\nNear the end of the party, ice cream was being served. The twins' mother rather forcefully said to Katie, \"No, you can't have any. It's fattening and unhealthy, and you've already eaten more than enough today.\" Then she turned to Maddie and said, \"You can have ice cream, you're skinny enough.\" This conversation was loud enough that at least a dozen other kids were able to hear it. \n\nKatie protested that it wasn't fair that everyone could have ice cream except for her. The twins' mother responded, \"You can have ice cream when you lose at least ten pounds.\" \n\nEnough was enough. I immediately confronted the twins' mother and VERY loudly said that she was \"bullying and humiliating her child,\" that \"if Katie developed an eating disorder it would be her fault,\" and that, \"mean, rude, judgmental people like you are the reason so many people end up needing therapy.\"\n\nLater that evening, my husband told me that I should not have gotten involved, because the situation was none of my business. Or at the very least, I should not have confronted their mother publicly and \"undermined her parental authority\" in front of her own kids and so many other children. I disagreed. Since she was so publicly criticizing and humiliating Katie, I believe it was fitting that I stood up for Katie in an equally public manner.   \n\n\nAITA for getting involved in a situation that was none of my business? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1691140634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hv1mx/aita_for_publicly_confronting_a_mother_who/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I may get downvoted for this because \u2018it\u2019s not your business\u2019 and all. But I am a firm believer in standing up for people, especially those who are unable to stand up for themselves. The woman was BULLYING her child and humiliating her in front of others. This kind of behaviour from one\u2019s own parents is a leading cause of teens developing EDs. I can\u2019t imagine what poor Katie has to go through at home if this is the mother\u2019s behaviour in public. I\u2019m glad you stood up for her.\n\n> undermined her parental authority \n\nIf parental authority is feeling free to publicly hurt and humiliate your child then it\u2019s a good thing you undermined it.", "NTA. Likely both children already have eating disorders with a mother like that", "NTA. As a chaperone you are there to look out for the children. That's what you did.", "NTA. Public humiliation could also have led other children to bully the girls, so addressing it loud and in public has been two times right", "NTA, Katie will remember you sticking up for her forever. Also what you said about eating disorder will help her realize it's not her fault if she develops a complicated relationship towards food.", "NTA. The mother you confronted is an abuser and shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to remain at the function", "Psychologist and body image researcher here! \n\nFrom the bottom of my heart\u2026 thank you for what you did for that girl. Her mom is clearly *not* concerned about her daughters health - if she were, then *neither* child would be allowed to have ice cream. The fact that the \u201cskinny\u201d kid gets to eat what she wants tells me that the mom is fatphobic, plain and simple. It\u2019s important to call out fatphobia when we see it because it has long-term, *dangerous* consequences. Did you know that anorexia has the highest mortality rate of *any* mental health disorder? (About 1 in 5). \n\nIn terms of whether you should\u2019ve confronted her privately, I disagree with others. I think public is the way to go and here\u2019s why: that mom isn\u2019t going to change. It doesn\u2019t matter what OP or anyone else does. Doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a private conversation or a public one - the mom *will not* change because she\u2019s been programmed by *decades* of societal expectation to believe that what she\u2019s doing is right. (And trust me, if it were that simple to get someone to change, my job would be a *lot* easier lol). So discussing this privately wouldn\u2019t have mattered. But by discussing it publicly, you\u2019ve at least shown that little girl that there *are* adults who stand up for what\u2019s good and right. There *are* people out there who don\u2019t value appearance above all else. She\u2019s going to remember you and it\u2019ll make a difference. So again - *thank you* for standing up for that little girl. \n\nAnd to those saying OP should\u2019ve minded their business if there wasn\u2019t abuse\u2026 I\u2019m 99% certain there is psychological abuse happening because if this is the type of behaviour the mom feels comfortable doing in public, can you imagine how much worse it is at home? Can you imagine the names this poor little girl is called behind closed doors? Can you imagine the *shame* that girl must feel every day, knowing that her own mother views her as \u201cless than\u201d, simply because of her weight? I\u2019ll admit, there\u2019s a 1% chance of no psychological abuse - maybe the mom *doesn\u2019t* belittle her daughter due to her weight. But as an expert in human behaviour, I highly doubt it. People are usually pretty predictable when it comes to how their shitty attitudes will manifest as shitty behaviour. Brains are cool like that. \n\nAnyway OP, you did the right thing. People used to think you shouldn\u2019t call out physical abuse either because it\u2019s \u201cnot your business\u201d. But times are changing. Responsible adults no longer sit by when vulnerable children are being bullied by their parents. Good for you", "NTA. Your husband is right to a point , but the Mom is well on her way to giving Katie a long term eating disorder and other MH issues based on your post, so I see why you felt the need to stand up for her.", "NTA. Both those poor girls are going to end up with a messed up relationship with food. \nWhile usually I would say pull the person aside and have a private conversation, I feel like her public bullying needed a public rebuke. Mom pulling that crap in front of classmates is basically giving them permission to bully Katie as well. Even if the mom doesn\u2019t get it, at least the kids who witnessed it saw that kind of behavior isn\u2019t ok.", "your husband is an AH \n\nso if we see a child getting bullied we should all just let it go cause it's not of our business???\n\nand you are absolutely right, my mother was like that with my sister when we were growing up and guess what? my sister has several eating disorders now as an adult that make her health suffer a new blow every month, it's heart breaking\n\nI don't have eating disorders but I have to go to therapy and get medicated for other image disorders just from seeing how my mom put so much importance on looks so yeah, the other twin will probably suffer the consequences as well", "Clearly NTA, and there\u2019s is no such thing as parental authority, that\u2019s just some bullshit that abusive parents push to validate their shit parenting method that just propagates trauma and resentment. There are parental duties and responsibilities and if that mom actually gave damn about her child as a whole instead surface level, she would instill a pattern of healthy habits at home and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue to begin with. She blatant, she was loud, she wanted to be seen, and she wanted her child to change from shame she was cultivating. If you watch bad parenting and don\u2019t say anything as a parent yourself, you shouldn\u2019t be a parent IMO.", "NTA I couldn\u2019t read past the cupcake. I am 5ft I was 90lbs most my life and underweight. I know weigh 115 and am healthy not fat at all actually I finally am a healthy weight. This mom sounds horrible.", "NTA As a victim of child abuse, it meant the world to me if someone stood up for me.", "NTA. Fuck that lady, projecting her insecurities onto her kids.", "NTA\n\nShe was bullying and shaming. Calling it out publicly was necessary. She\u2019s also showing favoritism. Gross behavior all around.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who are looking away when they witness abuse because it's \"none of their business\" are complicit in the abuse, period.\n\nThere was no danger to your life, so it was the right thing to do to step in. As a chaperone, isn't it literally your job to make sure that the kids are safe? That girl wasn't safe at all. \n\nIf her mum thinks it's okay to publicly shame her daughter, she can taste some of her own medicine.\n\nWe need to help each other if we want to grow as a society. You showed the girl that she was seen and noticed. At least she knows now that not all adults will ignore her. If you are being treated poorly by your parents in public and nobody steps in, it normalises the abuse. That's how people end up quietly taking shit for years, because they were taught that help is not coming.\n\nBystanders SUCK.", "NTA. My mom treated me like that from 10-13, when I finished puberty. All I heard was how fat I was. Looking back, I was an average weight and size. I was the same size as all my classmates. I wish someone had stood up for me.", "NTA but 115 for 5' is not at all 'a little heavy'.", "This is tough. Katie\u2019s mother was terrible. But you\u2019re not the parenting police, and have nothing to say about how she parents her children. If you thought this rose to the level of abuse where any decent citizen would intervene, you could have called child protective services. But you acted under your own authority, instead. \n\nFor this reason, although your heart was in the right place, you were an AH. \n\nObviously, Katie\u2019s mom is an abusive parent. \n\nSo ESH", "YTA because you, \n\n1. Involved yourself in a situation between another mother and her child, after making a judgement on the mother\u2019s actions, without knowing any details about WHY the mother was so concerned about her daughter\u2019s eating habits. \n\n2. Embarrassed the child and drew everyone\u2019s attention to the fact that her mother was monitoring what she ate. \n\n3. IF (and I\u2019m not implying she is) the mother is physically or mentally abusive to the daughter, you humiliating her in public will have resulted in repercussions for the child. You have to be very careful when tackling the behaviour of any parent as your interference could have severe consequences for the child. \n\nAs a final thought, I see that you previously asked if you were wrong to throw out leftovers, to prevent your son from eating them, as you feel he has poor eating habits & is overweight. So I\u2019m sensing some hypocrisy from you, since you feel you can involve yourself in what another parent feels is appropriate for their child, but were aggrieved at being called out for doing a similar thing yourself.", "Omg this was so hard to read. My mother was less cruel but she did say things like this to me in \u201cgentle\u201d or \u201cconcerned\u201d tones and caused me irreparable pain. Thank you for standing up for this little girl. How did the mom react?", "The behavior went off the rails most notably with \"I immediately confronted the twins' mother and VERY loudly...\"\n\nThe solution to shaming isn't more shaming. It isn't appropriate to disrupt a party that way, nor to upset children who are supposed to be enjoying accolades for their academic progress.\n\nIf you'd had a word quietly so the parent could respond in confidence it'd still be overstepping. A generalized soft admonition to support body image self esteem may still have gone awkward. YTA for not being discreet.", "ESH. All of you for  not privately talking.", "I'm leaning towards slight ESH, you were there only as a chaperone and there may have possibly been more tact ways you could have brought it up.\n\nAs a parent I certainly understand the desire for your children to be healthy but as you said that approach will likely cause harm.  \n\nAs someone not from the US I have a great deal of sympathy for how hard it must be over there (I'm guessing you guys are American?).  There are food standards and permitted ingredients that are illegal elsewhere such as Europe, much higher amounts of sugar, and salt, larger portions and expensive healthy options.\n\nContrasted over here it's far easier to come by fresh healthy produce for a fraction of the cost.  Many products have strict limits on the amount of sugar, salt and other ingredients (especially fizzy drinks).  Giving non sugar free fizzy drinks to young children is practically unheard of, even diet and sugar free versions can raise an eyebrow.  There is also much more awareness and public education towards healthy eating and families having an active lifestyle.", "YTA\n\nWhat business is it of yours how they manage their kids weight ?", "Mind your own business. The kid shouldn't be heavy at that age and extreme measures need to be taken.", "ESH", "ESH the mother was wrong in her methods but she wasn't fat shaming her daughter. She was trying to stop her eating junk food. I see in your only other post you like to get your nose in other people's business", "ESH. But what's worse is that everyone's assuming that the slimmer twin is healthier despite also eating pizza, icecream and cake. I get that this is a party, not an entire lifestyle, but if those kids aren't eating fruit and veg, and nuts and seeds, and healthy fats and oils and a minimum of refined, processed food, they're going to be equally unhealthy regardless of their size.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obesity rates are far higher amongst the poorest households, and they\u2019re the ones who can least afford to buy and cook healthier food. Plus, a lot of younger parents don\u2019t actually know HOW to cook. A former colleague of mine, who wasn\u2019t even born when I got married, asked me once how you make soup. HER mother didn\u2019t really cook and she\u2019d been raised on readymade foods and takeaways. She is now extremely obese, although to her credit, her own kids are healthy and active and of a normal weight.
