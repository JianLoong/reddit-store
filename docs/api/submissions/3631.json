We recently moved in together and we'd split chores equally. Cooking is outside of chores but I try to cook wenever I find time and since he praises the food I make.\n\n\n\nI'm in college and right now I'm preparing for my upcoming exams I can barely find time to shower let alone cook. He's been complaining about me not dedicating time towards cooking and has been giving a hard time about it. First it started out with him begging me to stop studying to cook dinner, now he's almost demanding it saying I prioritize studying over his feelings.\n\n\nYesterday, he kept pestering me all day while he was working telling me he wanted me to make dinner. One of those elavted dinners I make in my free time. I refused but he kept texting and presisting. I've had enough of it. What I did was grab a basic cookbook from the store, place it in a plate then cover the plate with a lid and left it at the table then went back to studying.\n\n\n\nHe got back, found it instead of an actual dinner and went off on me saying I was ridiculing him and that I could've used the time an effort to cook an actual dinner instrad of acting so childishly and spitefully. We had an argument then he went to stay with his brother. We kept arguing over the phone for a while then he texted me about how hurt he felt by what I did to him and how I basically made fun of his cooking abilities - he doesn't know how to cook.", "created_utc": 1669848453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z960e2/aita_for_serving_my_boyfriend_a_cookbook_for/", "score": 2360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would also be nice if he could occasionally prepare food for you when you have so much going on, too.\n\nI don't personally see the cookbook thing as ridicule, even, though I guess I get why he'd take it that way. If it was me, that would be a not-so-gentle reminder that, perhaps he too could figure out a way to throw a few ingredients together.\n\nI've known a lot of people who can't seem to bring water to a boil--and I am a basic, basic cook myself, don't let me fool you--but many of those same people can learn at least a few simple dishes if they really want something cooked for dinner.\n\nEDIT: It is also extremely weird to me that he has decided to try to guilt trip you by saying that not cooking him dinner because you are busy studying is somehow ignoring his \"feelings.\" That doesn't really make any sense, and to me it serves only as some way to make you feel like you are neglectful of the relationship itself because you are not cooking for him when you need to study during a busy time. It's not as though you are out there cooking a 4-course meal for one and ignoring him.", "[removed]", "NTA, and I cracked up.\n\nIf cooking is \u201coutside chores,\u201d he\u2019s expecting you to take on a significant piece of household labor over and above what he does.

He needs to take the hint. You are busy. If he wants someone to prioritize his happiness, then he needs to do it himself.", "NTA.

He's figured out how to eat before dating you, he can figure it out now.

Surely he knows how to procure food for himself.", "NTA but you are fantastically funny and good at sticking up for yourself! If you're dividing chores \"evenly\" but cooking isn't included, that needs to change. Cooking is obviously something your bf values and wants you to do, so he needs to pick up an equivalent amount of chores in other areas to make sure you have the time to take care of it.\n\nAlso - I really don't like his attitude.

Best of luck with finals and when you\u2019re done and have the emotional bandwidth to deal with absolute assholery and nonsense, dump him. \n\nHe should be cooking for you and supporting you during finals crunch time.

He\u2019s throwing a tantrum and expecting you to put him above anything else you have to do like your studies. He\u2019s the one being inconsiderate of your feelings and he keeps pestering you to get you to drop your boundaries for him. Then he ran away to his brothers. He\u2019s nearly 30. If he can\u2019t cook that\u2019s his responsibility to change, not to expect someone to pick up that basic life skill for him. It starts this way and it\u2019ll only spread farther. How long before the chores are no longer split evenly? When you get a job and are working more?", "NTA. Tell your bf to get off his lazy butt and learn how to cook. If he refuses, tell him he\u2019ll be responsible for providing delicious take out meals in lieu of homecoming. \n\nHe\u2019s a misogynist, are you sure you want to keep him?", "NTA.

Respect is everything.", "Legend, NTA.\n\nMight want to look for a new boyfriend who supports you though", "OP you are NTA, but you know who is? (Other than your boyfriend?)

Good Luck OP and drop this loser, he's full of shit.", "NTA. Now he has an opportunity to cook. Don't know why he isn't offering to help cook.

How did he feed himself before you lived together? Oh yeah divorce him bc it\u2019s aita.", "NTA. That was fantastic, well played. Also, everyone should know how to cook at least simple things. He needs to get over himself if he's that hungry.", "NTA. Hopefully you\u2019re financially ok without him there and he stays at his brothers for the remainder of life. Or until he grows up enough to read and follow directions. That is literally the start of cooking until you plan to try things out.", "NTA he can learn. His genitals don't prevent him from cooking do they?", "NTA. You don't have to live there.", "NTA. He\u2019s showing you how little he cares about your college and things that are important to you.

Please don\u2019t stay with this child\u2026.Actually my toddler tries to cook so maybe not \u201cchild.\u201d  Don\u2019t stay with this freeloading sack of laziness.

You have a few weeks of academic grind, presumably to help you succeed in your chosen field.\n\nEither he doesn't care about your success, or he's actively  sabotaging your success either because he sees it as a threat to his masculinity, or to keep you tied to him.\n\nNone of these outcomes are ok, but it's good you found this out now.", "My daughter is currently studying for finals. If her boyfriend treated her like a cook and was mad she didn't spend her time serving him, I would tell her to dump his lazy ass.  If he can't cook he can call and place an order. NTA", "NTA.

That isn\u2019t fair whatsoever. What about your feelings? I\u2019d let him starve tbh. Good luck with your exams", "Of course you're ridiculing him. He's behaving in a ridiculous fashion. As an aside, he could also take the time he has spent hassling and distracting you to read the cookbook you helpfully provided and prepare his own food. NTA.\n\nI'm concerned about how he is treating and speaking to you and his feeling of entitlement to your time and labor even at the cost of things that are important to you.

You're more busy than usual right now, he should be capable of picking up some slack around the house and cook his own dinner. It sounds like he is gaslighting you, too.

He's acting like a little brat.", "NTA.\n\nYour school is important and there will be many tines that this happens.\n\nJust a helpful tip from a random internet stranger that recently completed a masters degree. I would make extra for just myself and my husband. Big casseroles, pasta dishes etc, then I would freeze in take out containers to be reheated during those times. This will help you eat good nutritious meals to fuel your studying. Your BF may benefit, but honestly this tip is to help you not him.", "Not the asshole, but I hope it\u2019s a short lease.

This man does not respect or appreciate you, and him not caring about your studying and just throwing hissy fits to get what he wants makes it clear this is not a partnership that should be saved.

Cooking is outside of chores but I try to cook whrnever I find time and since he praises the food I make.\n\n\n\nI'm in college and right now I'm preparing for my upcoming exams I can barely find time to shower let alone cook. He's been complaining about me not dedicating time towards cooking and has been giving a hard time about it. First it started with him begging me to stop studying to cook dinner, now he's almost demanding it saying I prioritize studying over his feelings.\n\n\nYesterday, he kept pestering me all day while he was working telling me he wanted me to make dinner. One of those elavted dinners I make in my free time. I refused but he kept texting and presisting. I've had enough of it. What I did was grab a basic cookbook from the store, place it in a plate then cover the plate with a lid and left it at the table then went back to studying.\n\n\n\nHe got back, found it instead of an actual dinner and went off on me saying I was ridiculing him and that I could've used the time an effort to cook an actual dinner instrad of acting so childishly and spitefully. We had an argument then he went to stay with his brother. We kept arguing over the phone for a while then he texted me about how hurt he felt by what I did to him and how I basically made fun of his cooking abilities - he doesn't know how to cook.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Trust me. \n\nHe definitely might be someone with more of an acts of service love language and feeling neglected, but he needs to handle that better.
