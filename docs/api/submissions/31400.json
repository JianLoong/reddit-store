You are not responsible for the behavior of someone who harmed you. You are not responsible for the guilt someone feels from harming you, when that guilt registers because they are now sober and are realizing all the things they need to do to make amends. \n\nYou need to take care of yourself first. It\u2019s really unfortunate that you are having to deal with a mother\u2019s guilt. Your grandmother is 100% in the wrong but she\u2019s dealing with grief of losing her daughter and now having to fight to try and keep her son alive. She is putting all of that guilt on a hope that if you talk to him he will magically become a healthy person again. This is a false narrative that she has developed to try and cope and it\u2019s not fair to you. Please do the things that bring you joy and give you a good memories of your mom. Let them figure out what to do about themselves and you go and live the exact life you want to live surrounded by people who love and value you!!!!\n\nYou\u2019ve done so well coping and healing from this type of pain.", "NTA. The only thing that can keep your uncle sober is your uncle choosing to stay sober.", "NTA - even if you lived in the same house and had no college stuff going on, his sobriety has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. Grandma is still in the denial stage. You are not responsible for his actions.", "NTA. It's not your fault your grandma is manipulative. It's also not your fault uncle is an alcoholic and it's absolutely none of your responsibility.", "nta - your grandma should not be putting this responsibility on you, especially considering the distance and your own commitments. Your uncle's sobriety is his own responsibility, and you're doing your best to support him while managing your own life.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for anyone's actions or decisions than your own.\n\nIt's horrible your uncle is fighting the disease of alcoholism, but it's not your job to fight it for him.  You are facing your own stresses, difficulties and challenges right now.  Piling on the added onus of having to constantly worry about his sobriety isn't fair to you right now.\n\nAnd it was very unfair of your Grandmother to try and place that on you.", "NTA. Nobody can keep anyone sober. It's on them. You can give moral support, but you can't curb an addiction.", "hell no, a person\u2019s sobriety solely depends on them and their actions. and honestly it sound like granny is no good either. you\u2019re at an extremely important time in your life making responsible decisions and it sounds like you are doing exactly what you can within your boundaries. im sorry but he is a 32 year old man , if he\u2019s lonely he can find a way to make friends. please don\u2019t let this burden you", "NTA - my uncle (who passed away just prior to Christmas last year) was an alcoholic, & even with a lot of support, he was never able to stop drinking. In his mind, he didn't have a problem, & thought that he was only drinking moderately. You can give all the support in the world, but unless the person sees that they have an issue & are willing to commit to fixing the issue, then nothing will change.", "NTA. Grandma is too out of touch to even begin to understand the pace of your life right now. Giving a warm suggestion to try to call your uncle as much as you can? Sure. But putting his entire sobriety on your shoulders is manipulative and unfair.", "NTA\n\nHis sobriety is on him.  The same as you didn't make him start drinking, you can't stop him either.  Yes, family is important and he should know that he can reach out to family for help if he needs it, but it should never be down to one person who is designated by a different family member.  \n\nThe comment about your mother was an undeserved low blow.", "Big, Fat, Hard NTA. \n\nI have a struggling uncle and my Grandparents would NEVER suggest I have any part in resolving that. My relationships with my family are up to me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your Gram is obviously struggling with what\u2019s going on but good for you going out and earning a good life for yourself despite the struggles.", "nta - you're not responsible for someone else's sobriety, especially from 200 miles away. prioritize your own well-being and don't let guilt manipulate you.", "NTA - My best friend died last year from his alcohol addiction, 3 days after my mom died.  He spent 30 years trying to get me to start drinking and I spent 30 years trying to get him to stop. \n\nHis wife begged me to do something to stop him from drinking but you can't control somebody else's actions. If he does not want to sober up and does not get help there is nothing you can do.\n\nI tried everything I could to get him to stop drinking. He knew he was killing himself. He just didn't care, he was clinically depressed and he drank more and more to deal with it, which just made him more and more depressed. \n\nHis sobriety is on him.  My ex-girlfriend lost her best friend a year and a half ago due to her alcohol addiction. She tried to help her too. Unfortunately this is a hole that your uncle and our loved ones dug for themselves and they have to climb out themselves.\n\nMy penultimate girlfriend and my ex both went through alcohol recovery programs and quit drinking.  My penultimate girlfriend had been sober for 13 years when I met her and we're still mentoring other people in the program.  My last girlfriend got over it, then quit smoking, well over 10 years ago and never looked back.\n\nThe irony is we went to the same college and she's very distinctive looking. I saw an absolutely gorgeous blonde when I was in college right in front of the biology building (she's a biologist). Then I saw her light up a cigarette and started cursing because I would never date someone who smoked.  She was much more flexible in her personality back then (according to her) and we probably would have had a better chance of making something work.", "NTA. My dad was an alcoholic and I put so much blame on myself - but literally nothing I did helped him until he got his own help\n\nGetting a call from a niece won't magically cure him. \n\nIn fact- it may eventually help him realize that he is isolating himself from everybody who he cares about. Much love to both of you. \n\nSide note - Regardless of the alcoholism, I always hated the whole \"you need to call so-and-so more\" speech from family members when \"so-and-so\" never called me either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And loving him doesn't make you responsible for him. It is completely unfair for anyone to put that on you, nor does it help your uncle in any way - he is the only one who can help himself. Your grandmother is projecting her feelings onto you and that is not okay. You aren't responsible for your uncle's drinking and neither is she. \n\nIf you've never been, you should check out al-anon. You could benefit from it and your grandmother needs it desperately. Next time she tries to put that shit on you, be direct and tell her it's not up for discussion. You aren't responsible for him and neither is she. Tell her the next time she feels worried and is looking for answers or solution, she needs to go to al-anon or therapy, because you are breaking the cycle and are no longer a dumping ground for your family's trauma. Again, it serves no one and you *all* deserve better.\n\nYou are incredibly strong and resilient. It's incredible how much you've gone after what you want in life and how you haven't let your family trauma hold you back. Just be careful not go too far in the other direction; it's okay to take breaks and not be in control and on top of everything at all times. It doesn't serve you to put too much pressure on yourself You are clearly a badass, so don't ever forget it. Remember to be kind to yourself... and get *REALLY* good at boundaries.
