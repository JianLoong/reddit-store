This is not your problem to solve.  It's your mom's.  Don't let her put one toe into your home.  Live your own life  with your partner and kids.  NTA to say \"No more!\"", "NTA\n\nIf every single one of your children try to live with you amicably and you managed to piss off every single one of them when all you had to do was be pleasant, quiet, and play with the little ones, you done goofed and brought whatever happens onto yourself. Your brother wants her gone for the same reason you don't want her back. I don't blame him for trying to kick her out, but you're not responsible for her anymore. Put her in a home, if he doesn't like it then he can continue to keep her but there's no reason to put up with someone who doesn't want to live peacefully with you.", "NTA. You're not obligated to care for someone who never cared for you and treats you like shit. Your brother got the full mom: you and your younger sibs got nothing but abuse. I'd be telling my brother to eff himself if he thinks I'm doing another round with my mother. You're being far nicer than I by offering to assist him in placing her where she can do the least harm.", "NTA. Your brother got your mom while he was growing up and the least he can do to repay that is to take care of her. He doesn't get to offload her whenever it is problematic for him\n\n\nGiven how she treated you and the other siblings, none of you owe anything to your mom... There's an adage... \"As you sow, so you reap\" and your mom is reaping the effects of her decisions", "Stay firm and say no. Check on your younger siblings too so that they don't guilted into letting her into their lives.", "Definitely NTA. Let me say that again DEFINITELY NTA. Do not implode your own life or your family\u2019s lives for this woman. Safeguard your family at all costs. You will have done more than enough by putting her in an apartment. Be firm. Good luck.", "NTA. You raised yourself and your four younger siblings when your mother abandoned y'all; you have performed more than should ever be laid upon a young person. You owe her nothing, ever again. Your filial piety well is run dry, and plowed over. Cut contact with anyone who suggests otherwise.", "NTA. Your mom is your brother\u2019s problem. You don\u2019t owe your brother or your mom anything. Unless you want to be miserable, stay away from her.", "Omg, so much NTA.\n\nDo not let her into your home. You reap what you sow. She's been spewing poison for years so there is no leafy green pasture for her to retire in.", "Tell your brother that he came in and saved the day and saved his mother from the big bad you and your toxic household... why would he want to subject his mother to your abuse?\n\nNow that he's realized that the toxicity wasn't you but her he's stuck with the bed he's made. \n\nNTA\n\nMedicaid will cover a facility if shes that bad off.", "NTA. Brother and mother wouldn't even have my current phone number, at this point.", "NTA. Please do not take her back again! You did it once, generously, and you saw how that went. It would be very unwise to do it again.", "NTA\n\nand by now I'd withdraw your offer to pitch in! Your money wasn't good enough for your brother, let him deal with your mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:\n\nDon't let her into your house again, if she forces or lies her way in, treat her as the trespasser she is!", "NTA\n\nHow old is your mother? If you're the eldest daughter and have young children at home, she sure doesn't sound \"elderly\" to me.\n\nYou have *no* obligation to take her back into your home, and your brother is an asshole for suggesting it's your duty. If he feels it's his duty, he can keep her; if not, he can toss her out. \n\nYou were *more* than generous to offer to pay for part of an apartment for her.", "NTA \nYour mother seems like she\u2019s unable to understand the idea of boundaries and her behaviours towards you and your siblings.\n sounds like she\u2019s still trying to mother you when she wasn\u2019t around for you for so long.", "NTA. If a parent decides they don\u2019t want to be a part of their children\u2019s lives, the children have ZERO obligation when said parent crops back up \u2014 especially if it is only for financial reasons. Your only mistake was letting her in your home in the first place, I hope your future is bright and less toxic without her present", "NTA.\n\nIt is one thing to look after a family member/mother when they have always been around, supported you, looked after you. It is a totally different story for someone who dumped you to look after the eldest sibling, to then suddenly appear back in your lives expecting to be the \"boss\" of your household and speaking to/about you in the manner she has.\n\nYou have families of your own to support, something she chose not to do, and you're damn well within your rights to put your foot down to say enough is enough. It also says a lot if the kids can't stand her.", "NTA. You are not even close to being the AH. Everything you just described about your mom was abusive and manipulative. Not only do you have an absolute right now to bring her into your home, but you're also protecting your current family from having to live with a manipulative abuser. Good for you. Don't give in.", "NTA\n\nFrankly it's astonishing that you ever took her back into your life in any capacity, let alone taking her in. And she rewarded you with toxicity and vitriol? You would be foolish to introduce that to your kids. Stand your ground on this.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA your mother abandoned you and your siblings and then made your life he'll when she returned. You owe her nothing, and you owe your brother nothing. Don't let her destroy your peace a 3rd time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
