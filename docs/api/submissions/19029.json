Put her in a home, if he doesn't like it then he can continue to keep her but there's no reason to put up with someone who doesn't want to live peacefully with you.", "NTA. You're not obligated to care for someone who never cared for you and treats you like shit. Your brother got the full mom: you and your younger sibs got nothing but abuse. I'd be telling my brother to eff himself if he thinks I'm doing another round with my mother. You're being far nicer than I by offering to assist him in placing her where she can do the least harm.", "NTA. Your brother got your mom while he was growing up and the least he can do to repay that is to take care of her. He doesn't get to offload her whenever it is problematic for him\n\n\nGiven how she treated you and the other siblings, none of you owe anything to your mom... There's an adage... \"As you sow, so you reap\" and your mom is reaping the effects of her decisions", "Stay firm and say no. Check on your younger siblings too so that they don't guilted into letting her into their lives.", "Definitely NTA. Let me say that again DEFINITELY NTA. Do not implode your own life or your family\u2019s lives for this woman. Safeguard your family at all costs. You will have done more than enough by putting her in an apartment. Be firm. Good luck.", "NTA. You raised yourself and your four younger siblings when your mother abandoned y'all; you have performed more than should ever be laid upon a young person.

She's been spewing poison for years so there is no leafy green pasture for her to retire in.", "Tell your brother that he came in and saved the day and saved his mother from the big bad you and your toxic household... why would he want to subject his mother to your abuse?\n\nNow that he's realized that the toxicity wasn't you but her he's stuck with the bed he's made. \n\nNTA\n\nMedicaid will cover a facility if shes that bad off.", "NTA.

Your only mistake was letting her in your home in the first place, I hope your future is bright and less toxic without her present", "NTA.\n\nIt is one thing to look after a family member/mother when they have always been around, supported you, looked after you. It is a totally different story for someone who dumped you to look after the eldest sibling, to then suddenly appear back in your lives expecting to be the \"boss\" of your household and speaking to/about you in the manner she has.\n\nYou have families of your own to support, something she chose not to do, and you're damn well within your rights to put your foot down to say enough is enough. It also says a lot if the kids can't stand her.", "NTA. You are not even close to being the AH. Everything you just described about your mom was abusive and manipulative. Not only do you have an absolute right now to bring her into your home, but you're also protecting your current family from having to live with a manipulative abuser. Good for you. Don't give in.", "NTA\n\nFrankly it's astonishing that you ever took her back into your life in any capacity, let alone taking her in. And she rewarded you with toxicity and vitriol?
