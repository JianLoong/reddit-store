Put her in a home, if he doesn't like it then he can continue to keep her but there's no reason to put up with someone who doesn't want to live peacefully with you.", "NTA. You're not obligated to care for someone who never cared for you and treats you like shit. Your brother got the full mom: you and your younger sibs got nothing but abuse. I'd be telling my brother to eff himself if he thinks I'm doing another round with my mother. You're being far nicer than I by offering to assist him in placing her where she can do the least harm.", "NTA. Your brother got your mom while he was growing up and the least he can do to repay that is to take care of her. He doesn't get to offload her whenever it is problematic for him\n\n\nGiven how she treated you and the other siblings, none of you owe anything to your mom... There's an adage... \"As you sow, so you reap\" and your mom is reaping the effects of her decisions", "Stay firm and say no. Check on your younger siblings too so that they don't guilted into letting her into their lives.", "Definitely NTA. Let me say that again DEFINITELY NTA. Do not implode your own life or your family\u2019s lives for this woman. Safeguard your family at all costs. You will have done more than enough by putting her in an apartment. Be firm. Good luck.", "NTA. You raised yourself and your four younger siblings when your mother abandoned y'all; you have performed more than should ever be laid upon a young person.

She's been spewing poison for years so there is no leafy green pasture for her to retire in.", "Tell your brother that he came in and saved the day and saved his mother from the big bad you and your toxic household... why would he want to subject his mother to your abuse?\n\nNow that he's realized that the toxicity wasn't you but her he's stuck with the bed he's made. \n\nNTA\n\nMedicaid will cover a facility if shes that bad off.", "NTA.

Your only mistake was letting her in your home in the first place, I hope your future is bright and less toxic without her present", "NTA.\n\nIt is one thing to look after a family member/mother when they have always been around, supported you, looked after you. It is a totally different story for someone who dumped you to look after the eldest sibling, to then suddenly appear back in your lives expecting to be the \"boss\" of your household and speaking to/about you in the manner she has.\n\nYou have families of your own to support, something she chose not to do, and you're damn well within your rights to put your foot down to say enough is enough. It also says a lot if the kids can't stand her.", "NTA. You are not even close to being the AH. Everything you just described about your mom was abusive and manipulative. Not only do you have an absolute right now to bring her into your home, but you're also protecting your current family from having to live with a manipulative abuser. Good for you. Don't give in.", "NTA\n\nFrankly it's astonishing that you ever took her back into your life in any capacity, let alone taking her in. And she rewarded you with toxicity and vitriol?

Is there one near you?", "Assisted living homes. Do not let her back in. If your brother has a problem he can keep her.", "But your mother has a home! With your brother... she's not on her own, and not with a caregiver.  She has your brother! Problem solved, surely.\n\nYou have no responsibility towards her.

Your bother doesn't want her to live alone? Then she can stay with him. If he won't let her live with him, then he doesn't get to volunteer you to take over from him.\n\nAs for your mother... she made her bed, and now she gets to lie in it.  Alone.

You were kind that you didn't; report her to the police.\n\nBrother, the golden child, doesnt want either.\n\nYou mother sounds like a narcissist.  Most people find it very difficult to deal with them.\n\nElderly mother is NOT moving in with you.  She abandoned you when you were 15.  When she returned, she treated the rest of you horribly.  \n\nNTA", "Why are you having anything to do with her at all?  She abandoned you and your siblings.

The only solution is to find her a cheap place to live and pitch in any extra money that's needed to maintain her living space.\n\nIf she needs some kind of assisted living, she might be able to get it financed through Medicaid. It would probably help to consult an elder law attorney so you can find out what the rules are for Medicaid and whether or not your mother would qualify for it. \n\nThere has to be some kind of aid she could quality for, if she has no source of income. If nothing else, she might be able to quality for food stamps and assistance with her energy bills. You need to look into any programs for indigent seniors that might be available in your local area.

You\u2019ve done way more than you share. You were abandoned and had to give up everything to pick up the slack.

Not by a long shot. \n\nIt was very kind of you to take her in when you did. \n\nYou do not owe her any further kindness, and as you said, it would just expose everyone to more toxicity. \n\nYour brother got the benefit of your mother not ditching him, so it's up to him what to do with her.

He didn\u2019t have to raise 4 kids at 15! Do NOT let your awful mother back in. She can go to a homeless shelter or get a job or figure it out on her own. She dumped you and then stole from you.
