Unfortunately I share a child with this person so he is not completely out of my life. Just a few days ago when we were exchanging custody of our kids he started yelling at me (in front of our child) about The Time I Embarrassed Him In Front of Everyone and how he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s the reason he can\u2019t get a date anymore. \n\nSo here\u2019s what happened. We were hosting a board game party, which we used to do frequently, and there were 18 people there. Someone had made an off-color joke about queefing and everyone laughed and my then-boyfriend decided to share with everyone that I do it \u201call the time\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cgross.\u201d This is not a thing that has ever happened to me in any other relationship before or since. I just ignored it at first\u2014 like okay, boyfriend just said something dumb\u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t let it go and kept laughing and making loud fart sounds saying that\u2019s what my vagina sounds like. Our friends were obviously uncomfortable but were kind of nervous-laughing.\n\nWhen he wouldn\u2019t drop the joke I interrupted him and said in front of everyone that this isn\u2019t a thing that had happened to me with anyone else and that the reason it was so noisy is because he has a two-and-a-half-inch weenie and tended to pull it all the way out during sex. Which he was really bad at. \n\nNeedless to say, he did not find the joke amusing when it was about his body and he started telling everyone that I was just joking. I told everyone (who I know was totally uncomfortable by this point) that I was completely serious and that he really did have a tiny penis and really was terrible at sex. \n\nOur relationship didn\u2019t last very long after that for a million reasons but this whole thing certainly didn\u2019t help. It was four years ago now and I\u2019m now happily married and doing very well and he hasn\u2019t been able to find a date since then, which he attributes to word getting out and everyone knowing about his penis.\n\nSo anyway\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m NTA but he believes I am, and I\u2019m open to hearing if this was completely out of line in context.

So both of you have very little knowledge about something that normal and why it happens", "ESH. Y'all need help.", "ESH.", "ESH you both sound like terrible partners.", "You're both AH's.  Talking about intimate, personal physical issues in a friend setting is never going to turn out well.  Very immature.  And it's impossible for \"everyone\" to know about his penis size, since there are 10 billion people in the world, most without Internet, so that's just a lie.", "ESH\n\nThe two of you sound so immature. Apparently he didn't mind your queefing when you were together, nor did you mind his small weenie, so you're just making yourselves look ridiculous.", "ESH because two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.

You two sound pretty toxic for each other.", "ESH since you both acted immature, inapropriate, petty, and childish. He shouldn't have tried to publicly humiliate you if he didn't want the same in return. But also you could've handled things with a lot more grace. \n\nAlthough, I'm sure it felt pretty great to say it out loud and have your \"Gotcha!\" moment lol. But like you said, their are children involved. It's time to grow up.", "ESH, he shouldn\u2019t have joked about you queefing, you shouldn\u2019t have told everybody what his penis size was. Both of you were immature", "ESH, but I don\u2019t really blame you for letting your ex have it like that after he wouldn\u2019t stop being an asshole. And it\u2019s stupid of him to blame you for his inability to get a date. He can go on the apps and meet strangers who have no tie to your friend group. Sounds like his personality might be the real issue.", "ESH. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. What on earth made you think you are not an asshole in this case? \n\nIt sounds like you were both MEAN to each other as a couple so it\u2019s not surprising it didn\u2019t work out.", "ESH you could\u2019ve made fun of anything other than his dick size because us guys are already self conscious about our size and when you make fun of it especially if it\u2019s in front of people you\u2019re demasculating him but he should\u2019ve dropped the queefing joke when you asked", "ESH.

Don't justify saying something mean and inappropriate. You can't. He was mean. You were mean back. Neither you nor this one comment is responsible for his dating life afterward.

You both sound incredibly mature.", "YTA - He did something unacceptable, instead of calling him out on it like an adult you went nuclear on his ass (well his dick). Clearly both of you had communication problem together before this and it's sad but you went over the top making an uncomfortable situation for your guests even worse, I'm sure they walked away thinking less of both of you. It's not your fault he can't get a date unless he is trying to date from that pool of your common friends which he shouldn't be doing anyways.", "YTA.  While your BF was extremely out of line mocking your bodily noises publicly, at least that is something that was fleeting and everyone has had it happen, so it's not like they don't have that problem too, sometimes. But, a small penis doesn't ever go away. Being painted with that brush is particularly excruciating for men. It changes the way people see you, believe it or not. No one looked down at you for queefing, but I guarantee they judged him for having a little one.", "YTA, your ex was also an A. The only reason this isn\u2019t Everyone is an A is because you got a child involved and friends involved who really have no business involved in your bickering. Your ex was an ass by making this joke about you in front of a bunch of friends and not letting up, also bringing this random argument into your child\u2019s exchange, but your the Ass by bringing your sex life, or dissatisfaction thereof, to the party and also not letting it go. In the end, regardless of how you may have ended things, you both need to grow up and be adults to raise that child.", "For the situation, YTA.  And here is why.  \n\nQueefing is not about your body specifically but more about how something is being done.  Positions or approaches cause this more than anything.  He's an idiot for talking about it, but it's not anymore private than passing gas or burping as far as I'm concerned. It's not something you generally joke about, but not a big deal over all.\n\nYou escalating to telling about his small manhood; this has sociological implications for him.  I'm not saying he didn't deserve some retort or that he was right. He wasn't.  But doing what you did in front of 18 people means you've affected a massive amount of negative social potential on him.  \"I heard so and so has a small dick\" from 18 other whispered  voices doesn't take long to cause harm.  The reality is that it does and will happen, and in today's climate, that is likely hard for him to overcome. \n\nComing after you after all the time, yeah asshole move too, but frustration has a way of seeing an opportunity and using it to get out.", "Yall both genuinely suck yta", "YTA", "NTA font start ot if you can't take it", "NTA, \n\nHOWEVER, you had an opportunity to be the bigger person and talk to him in private or something about not making jokes about your body, but instead you stooped to his level \n\nAn eye for an eye makes the world go blind", "INFO: was it true?", "NTA. I love how he attributes not getting a date to \u201ceveryone knowing about his penis.\u201d Like literally the whole world knows from you just telling a friend group. And like everyone would care?

There's nothing wrong with a small penis but It's not your fault it's small. He told in himself when he told everyone his penis creates air bubbles in your vagina.", "Kind of feels like a justified ah situation to me. You were both AH to your friends though.

No pun intended.", "NTA. he was body shaming you for literal air being up your cooch bc he would pull out all the way. \n\nalso i see people saying its your fault for continuing the argument and making guests uncomfortable. He only stopped when you explained it.

I mean it wasn't going to work out with him anyway since he acts like that, but there are some things you never say about a person you love even if you're mad.
