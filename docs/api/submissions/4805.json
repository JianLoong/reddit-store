Every year the family gets a large turkey and other meat / dairy products.\n\nAbout a week ago my SIL asked me if I had brought a turkey yet, I explained no, instead I had some Quorn substitutes. She acted sort of uncomfortable and a few days ago her and my MIL confronted me and said that it was fine for me not to eat meat but if I was going to host I needed to at least let her buy and prepare the turkey to bring, I said no.\n\nMy husband spoke to me and said that it was very important to him and his family to have a \"real\" turkey, I said it is my house and I can decide what I do and do not want in it. My husband and me argued and he said that it is his house to and he is allowed to let his family stay and enjoy Christmas dinner.\n\nI told him that no one is coming in to the house with anything unless we both agreed, he called me selfish and I refused to let us host.\n\nAs of now SIL is going to host and while my husband is going I am choosing not to do so, he is saying I am being selfish and forcing my beliefs onto his family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671132179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmtkv4/aita_for_refusing_to_host_a_meat_christmas/", "score": 3071, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get it.  This is very important to you.\n\nHowever, you should have declined hosting Christmas on the grounds of your vegan beliefs.\n\nInstead, you decided you were going to just use subsitutes for meat and cheese without telling anyone.\n\nTHAT...is not something you can do when you are part of a blended family.\n\nIt's immature and selfish...and now you will be spending Christmas alone because of it and have possibly alienated your husband's entire side of the family\n\nAre your beliefs on veganism really worth all of this?\n\nWould have not been simpler to just explain to the family \"hey I don't want meat in our home, so we are pulling ourselves out of the running for hosting, but we will happily pick up some slack on sides and decorations and cleaning since we won't be hosting.  Is that ok?\"\n\nAlso...if you want people to be respectful of your beliefs, you have to be respectful of theirs.  And I get that it is hard to do that when you make your veganism a part of your identity, but situations like this are going to continue to happen as long as you put your beliefs and your identity before that of other people", "YTA for several reasons:\n\n1. \"I said it is my house and I can decide what I do and do not want in it\" -- unless your name is the only one on the deed and your husband is your tenant,  it's both of y'alls house\n2. When you marry someone, you marry into their family. You don't get to tell them what traditions are going to be continued or not\n3. What kind of host doesn't want their family to actually enjoy themselves?", "YTA. You are the type of vegan that makes other vegans look bad.", "God your worse than the woman who doesn't drink and banned everyone from having a glass of wine with dinner. \n\nActually worse cos there's only a week left till Xmas and you had zero intention of telling them there was going to be no meat. \n\n\nXmas is for EVERYONE and yes whilst it's your house it's your husband's too and he should have a say in allowing the meat option in his house, it's not like your being forced to handle it and it cook it. Someone offered to do that for you. \n\nInstead of being a grown up you've decided to exclude yourself from the celebrations like a child who has been told she can't have her own way. \n\nYTA", "YTA. If the tables were turned and your in-laws were hosting and not only had no vegan dishes for you or your husband, but banned you from bringing your own I would be calling them the AH's.", ">\tMy in-laws have a tradition of taking it in turn to host Christmas, and this year, our first year married, it will be our year.

And you even refused to compromise.", "YTA. Your husband is correct: it\u2019s his home, too.  Clearly his identity as a vegan (seriously, that\u2019s an identity now?) isn\u2019t as all-consuming as you thought. \n\nAnd while I respect that you don\u2019t want to prepare or consume meat products, that doesn\u2019t hold for the rest of your guests. Them preparing and bringing the dish themselves is the ideal compromise. \n\nIs this really the hill you\u2019re gonna die on?", "Yes YTA.\n\nThem insisting *you* prepare it would be one thing, but they offered to purchase and prepare it and bring it with them. I don\u2019t see the problem?\n\nYour husband is right, you\u2019re being selfish\u2026not to mention extremely petty.\n\nSeems like a pretty ridiculous hill to die on and estrange yourself from your in-laws over.", "i'm sorry but the term \"meat christmas\" is sending me. \n\nYTA and you should work on building other aspects of your identity and personality. this ain't it.", "You want them to accept your beliefs but ignore theirs. She wasn't even asking you to make it, she was going to do wit and it doesn't hurt you they eat the turkey.\n\nGood job in disregarding your husband's very valid emotions. Yta", "YTA - and look, nothing against your vegan diet; but if you were perfectly fine to join for dinners hosted in your husband's families houses that had meat and dairy at the table, it's no different that you're expected as a host to provide the same traditional food they are used to eating and serving. If your MIL is willing to do this for you, I don't see how it's any different than sitting at a non vegan dinner at anyone else house; your home isn't some kind of temple to your dietary beliefs unless they were fatal allergies. Also do you really want to torpedo in-law relations by ruining a traditional dinner on the FIRST year you are married?? The fact that it came as a surprise that you'd be serving a vegan dinner means you didn't communicate that with everyone, and that is also pretty sucky. I'd be pissed if I expected turkey and was served Quorn.", "YTA you're ruining Christmas dinner for everyone who isn't vegan and you know it. You're making other vegans look bad too, and confirming a huge bias many folks have against vegans.", "YTA - if you were okay with being around meat at previous holidays, then you should have let your MIL make the turkey and bring it. Also your husband wanted his family to be welcome in your guys home. If it was a food allergy, then that\u2019s one think. This is a preference.", "YTA. You had to anticipate this happening. You're not the AH for your beliefs, but you should have never offered to host.", "YTA. Although it kinda doesn't matter whether you're an asshole or not. What matters here is that you've damaged your marriage - sounds as though your husband has voted with his feet & sided with his family.\n\nNow the family have seen the gap between you on this subject, they can exploit  it forevermore, every Christmas and husband will be between a rock and a hard place every year.\n So, asshole or not, know that his family will hone in on this aspect every year now, and you've dug your own grave.\n\nYour guests did the right hing by offering to pay for, prepare at their home, and supply a turkey to meet their needs - your kitchen would not have been touched. They behaved gracefully, and you were unwise to decline that offer IMO.", "Yta I was with you until you pulled the 'it's MY house', um, it's also you're husband's house so why is your opinion worth more than his?", "YTA and this is exactly why so many jokes about vegans exist. How do you know someone is a vegan? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you.", "Yeah, vegan here. YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t see the problem with relatives bringing something meaty with them, as long as they don\u2019t expect me to cook it.\n\nI\u2019ve suffered through *YEARS* of people excitedly serving vegetables \u201cthat you can eat!!\u201d with meat residue or grease on them from cooking them in the same pan. I was miserable and hungry at every event. But I still can\u2019t see how, exactly, someone brining a turkey you don\u2019t have to touch is causing so much issues.", "YTA.\n\nYou presumably have known for some time that you\u2019d be hosting this year, and you waited until the last minute to tell them you were making a vegan meal? That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nThe moment the idea of you hosting came up, you should have stated your boundaries. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late for anyone to change plans. If your SIL didn\u2019t ask, I\u2019m sure you would have sprung it on them when they walked in.", "Definitely YTA. It\u2019s his house too. They\u2019re not even asking you to cook it. Just exist with it in your presence. You\u2019re not more important than your husband sorry.", "YTA. You and your husband have had plenty of opportunities to say to his family \"hey, if we celebrate at my house we can't have the traditional meal because we don't allow meat in our house, how do we want to handle this?\" Maybe their answer would be \"it's fine to change the meal,\" and maybe it was \"we'll have turkey somewhere else, then come to your house for vegan dessert and coffee\" (or some other solution). But YTA for just assuming they'd be fine skipping a bunch of their traditional family holiday foods without any discussion.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nI guess you're technically correct that you can serve what you want at your own home. But this thread is not about what *can* you do it's about what *should* you do.\n\nIt's one thing for you to refuse to prepare meat. But to even refuse to allow someone else to bring meat? What are you trying to accomplish here? You apparently have no issue being around people who consume animal products; otherwise you would not have attended prior Christmas celebrations where people consumed them. And then to tell your husband that he cannot host unless everything is done your way? That's not the recipe (no pun intended) for a healthy relationship. You owe your husband and his family an apology for your lack of hospitality.", "YTA- for exactly the reason you state. If you were unwilling to host something traditional or allow others to do the parts you are uncomfortable with- you should have made that known from the outset. Now it's awkward AF  and if you're going to draw a hard line you are going to cause a problem for your husband with his family, for you with your husband and big time between you and his family. If you're good with that- you do you. but you should have been explicitly clear when you agreed/offered to host that you were going to do this so they could have passed the chore on to someone else who would have had time to prepare. \n\nI highly suggest you consider what compromise you can make or this will be one to remember and not in a good way.", "YTA  you should have just said no to hosting in the first place if you were going to force your diet on everyone", "YTA\nI can understand you not wanting to prepare non vegan meals,  you might not even know how to prepare those things. But banning animal products on such a traditional occasion is too far.\n\nWay to start your first year of marriage!", "YTA. OP\u2019s husband wants to provide his family with their traditional meals, but OP is super-controlling. I\u2019m a vegetarian (not vegan), but I\u2019m still slow roasting or smoking a huge prime rib roast for everyone else.\n\nAs others have said in this forum, the holidays are for everyone, OP, and you\u2019ve just taken the roast beast and other trimmings away from all the Whos on Whoville. That\u2019s okay, though, as it seems they\u2019ll have a lovely time without you.", "YTA.  Decline to host then.  Geez, you have started this marriage off on the wrong foot.  Like it or not, his family is part of your life.", "Yta\n\n\nYour husband who is also a vegan wants to make sure they have a turkey.  In addition how would you feel if they refused to have any vegan food at their holiday?\n\n\n\nThey wanted to force the issue by not providing a dish or a couple that you could eat? \n\n\nIn addition refused you to bring one if they were uncomfortable cooking one.\n\n\nYou would be up in arms. You are going to ruin your relationship with not only your husband but his family because you cannot see the double standard. \n\n\nWhy host if you don't want to make sure everyone has something they can enjoy and a couple of traditions.  Especially when they are not asking you to cook it.", "YTA, I guess you weren't lying when you said it is a big part of your \"identity\". You sound insufferable and the type of stereotypical vegan that makes people talk ish about vegans. You know you can be vegan and still have a personality?", "YTA, don't force your veganism onto other people. I understand if you don't want to prepare the turkey, heck, I'm not even vegan and I don't see me doing it in the near future, but why couldn't you just let them bring a turkey? If it's contamination in the oven you're worried about, you could just ask them to bring the turkey already cooked.", "Info : what did you eat at their houses the past few years? Either they made something specific for you or you brought your own food ? In that case this is exactly what they're asking you to do for them. So unless they force fed you meat and had nothing else for you to eat YTA", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing if you both agreed no meat in the house but he said he wanted them and they could bring meat. No one is forcing you to make or eat it", "You\u2019re one of those vegans, definitely the AH.", "You are the AH. You can't force your veganism on other people especially holidays. If you won't prepare the turkey, you allow someone else to. They don't force you to eat meat. You shouldn't force them to eat vegan food.", "YTA \n\nHopefully you realize that the world doesn't revolve around you and you alone. Your husband and your husbands family deserve to be represented during a family holiday. You don't get to make the executive decision in this and dismissing the person you're married too out of selfishness and pure stubbornness isn't beneficial or positive.", "A self righteous Vegan?!?!\n\nI'm shocked!\n\nWell, not that shocked.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. YOU can decide what you do or do not want in tour house, but he cant?? And then you skip the dinner at your SIL's house because you cant get your way?", "YTA.\n\nIf you are OK with going to a family dinner where turkey is served, then it is not reasonable for you to refuse to have a prepared turkey served in your home.\n\nIn either case, you don't have to prepare it. Your house won't be filled with the smell of roasting turkey for hours as if you made it yourself.  You are eating near it, near other people eating it. You can smell it while you are eating no matter who's house you are gathered in.\n\nWhat exactly is the objection, other than \"it's my house and I don't have to.\"", "I knew EXACTLY how this was going to go when you said that veganism is a part of your identity. Your diet should never be an identity. Like...ever.\n\nNo one is making you eat turkey. They want the option. You know, because it's a family function and not everyone in the family is on the same diet. You're hosting, that means they're guests. Part of being a host is catering to the guests. They weren't even asking you to buy or touch the turkey, so you don't have to have anything to do with it; they were offering to do it. They just wanted to bring one ffs. Check yourself. You're one of those Vegans. It's not a good look.\n\nYTA", "YTA. you are hosting a dinner for people that you know are not vegan. why on earth would you try to force them to eat vegan meat. very tone deaf. you need to grow up.", "YTA. Why would you host Christmas dinner knowing your husbands family have traditions? If you are not comfortable having meat or dairy in your house then don\u2019t host a holiday meal.", "Yep.

I am hosting some vegans for Christmas, shall I tell them too bad, they get prime rib like the rest of the guests? No, I have a vegan ham, turkey, cheese spread being delivered tomorrow so those families feel just as included as the carnivores. Have them bring the meat if you refuse to cook it. Surely there must be a mature compromise instead of childish fit throwing.", "Yes, OP, YTA. You tried to force your partner\u2019s family to celebrate under your terms and opted out of the tradition entirely because they found the conditions disagreeable and declined to abide. And now you\u2019re opting out of participating in the celebrations at all because you can\u2019t hold them hostage.", "YTA - don\u2019t force your lifestyle on others and let them bring what they want for their traditions or don\u2019t host at all.  Your husband is going to find someone else with your attitude and he will be better for it.", "YTA.\n\nMainly because it\u2019s pretty clear you had no intention of telling them. It\u2019s fine if you didn\u2019t want to serve turkey but that should have been established the second they asked you to host. Not a week before Christmas and only because your SIL brought it up.\n\nGiven the situation, letting them bring one would have been the best compromise.", "YTA Part of hosting is catering to your guests to a reasonable degree. If you\u2019re not willing to cook and serve those things then you shouldn\u2019t be hosting. It\u2019s best if they do it somewhere else if you\u2019re going to act that way. My SIL doesn\u2019t like turkey and neither does her husband but she makes it for us when she wants to host thanksgiving. You\u2019ve got to learn to be more accommodating and flexible if you ever want to host your family in the future", "Yeah, YTA. \n\nYou can make vegan stuff, but you also should have stuff others will eat.\n\nWhen you go to their dinners, do you eat everything they serve? No? So why should they? \n\nIt's not hard to have both options available.", "YTA and you\u2019re ruining any chance of a good relationship with your in-laws.", "YTA.

It seems like you've completely cut off any semblance of a choice for him in his own house but adamantly refusing. Also why was this not a conversation when you were picked to host? Did you even bother to think about the rest of your family? How did it get so close to Christmas before this conversation was even had? That's extremely rude and uncaring. How you have any family at all is beyond me.", "YTA. I bet you expect a vegan option from the carnivores.", "YTA \u2026 Are you okay?
