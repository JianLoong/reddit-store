She was divorced from her ex-husband Randy and they have my stepson together Finn (15). Finn has two siblings. One from his dad, a half sister, who is 8 and is in a wheelchair. I also have a 6 year old son with Kate who is autistic.\n\nFinn's half sister has a lot of complex issues related to her disability and I am aware because of communication between Kate and Randy as well as hearing Finn talk about life there. Because of their daughter's issues, Randy and his wife do not allow Finn to do typical kid things if it would upset their daughter. He will often be told he should focus less on his friends and more on his sister, etc.\n\nKate and I are not totally innocent either. We have struggled to juggle our son's challenges while making sure Finn can still be a kid and enjoy himself and not suffer because of his sibling. Our home needs to be quiet for our son and he doesn't do good with crowds so going out as a family is not possible, even with noise cancelling headphones. Our son is very limited and will always need someone to take care of him. Kate and I started saving for that day, so that he can go into a good home when we are no longer able to take care of him. But we also try to help him learn as much as he can, so he can gain all the independence possible.\n\nFinn has struggled a lot lately and it does feel like most people in both families feel like he should be grateful for his health and for his lack of additional struggles which both siblings have. I felt horrible realizing the last few years Finn has really not experienced much of a life. I told Kate I was going to take him to an amusement park for a day and let him be a kid. I knew Kate wouldn't do it but I knew I could and should. So last week I brought him out for the day and we had such a great time. I let him go on everything he wanted, bought him all the junk food he wanted and made sure he knew he deserved to have fun and good things too. I know glass children are often forgotten or expected to be adults about everything. Finn had so much fun. He was happier than I have seen him in years.\n\nBut the reaction from others was negative. From Randy and his wife, from Kate's parents and from mine, as well as from Randy's parents. The general consensus is Finn should not have been brought to do something his siblings could not enjoy. From his dad's side it's that his half sister was heartbroken that he got to experience something she never can but wants to experience. From mine and my wife's parents it's that I left my son behind and showed a lack of regard for him. Kate spoke to her parents and told them I had done a wonderful thing for Finn and wasn't wrong to do it. I also blocked my parents because I didn't want to hear their crap.\n\nKate has been dealing with a lot of fallout from Randy and his wife too, though.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy because I seem to have become the devil to these people for what I did.

I did not consider there would be fallout. His young half sister is upset because she wanted to go and can't and is upset that my stepson got to go and had such a good time. My son isn't really aware but I didn't ever consider bringing him. I guess I could have found something for us to do as a family of four that Finn could enjoy instead of going off alone with him. These are reasons I guess I could be considered an asshole.

I\u2019m sure that you made memories that he will never forget. \n\nAs far as the family drama - do they expect that Finn never does anything that his siblings can\u2019t? If your son is  nonverbal and needs constant care it is unlikely that he will marry, have children, hold a \u201cnormal\u201d job, etc \u2026 Do they expect Finn to remain single, childless, jobless, etc \u2026 just because his brother does? And I\u2019m sure that there are many things that Finn\u2019s stepsister won\u2019t be able to do due to being in a wheelchair, but that shouldn\u2019t diminish Finn\u2019s choice to do them. It sounds like he has been making selfless sacrifices on behalf of his siblings, which is commendable, but surely they would and should understand that every individual has circumstances unique to themselves that dictate what they do with their lives - mentally, physically, financially, etc \u2026 - and that even though it might not feel fair, it\u2019s life.", "NTA you did a great thing for him, and you should continue doing so in the future.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt\u2019s torture to not allow a child to do things because their disabled siblings can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s just lazy and hurtful parenting. \n\nYou are literally depriving a child of being a child when you do this.\nAll it does is create resentment in the child, which results in them leaving at 18 and NOT looking back. \n\nWhat you did was a good thing and it should be done more often for his sake.\nIf everyone expects him to walk on ehh shells, then they need to make sure they reward him thusly for it.", "Finn is going to remember that day with you at the amusement part for the rest of his life. Good for you for doing it with him. \n\nIt sucks for his siblings that they couldn\u2019t do something like that, but telling a fifteen year old he should be grateful for his health, now sit down, be quiet, and let us spend time, money, and attention on your needier siblings- sucks for the healthy kid. He needed attention, too.

It took me 30 seconds to find them on Google.\n\n>Randy and his wife do not allow Finn to do typical kid things if it would upset their daughter\n\nWhat's going to happen when she grows up and her parents can't stop other people from doing things she can't? They're setting her up for a life of resentment and bitterness. It sounds as though she already sees herself as a victim. They're doing her (and Finn) a huge disservice.\n\nYou sound like a great dad/stepdad. Please keep giving Finn the positive attention he needs.", "NTA. There are so many posts here written by people whose childhood was like Finn's and who turn 18 and leave home. I'm glad you recognized that these children have very different ages and needs and equal treatment doesn't always mean equitable treatment. I have no idea why everyone is ganging up on you for treating Finn well.", "Definitely NTA, if anything you should be congratulated by your family for being the only one to actually consider the child who gets the less attention all the time.  I feel they're projecting their own guilt onto you for not stepping up, and not doing more stuff for your stepson. And also not being self aware enough of how much your stepson misses out on.\n\nKeep up the good work, and please carry on with the one on one with your stepson, since nobody else can be bothered with him.", "NTA, anyone who says he should miss out on being a kid for his siblings sure is though!\n\nYou did a great thing, and the fact that you're actually aware of him being forced to not have a normal childhood and doing what you can to help with that is fantastic.  Just because his siblings can't do something doesn't mean he should be unable to experience it, that will only breed resentment by him towards them and anyone that tries to box him in.  He's his own person and should get to have all those experiences, and know he's allowed to grow up and have a normal life.\n\nAlso good on you for not thinking he's the plan to take care of your other kids, I have a feeling his bio dad doesn't feel the same.  Be sure to dispel that myth.  And let him know that when it's time to go to college and he's able to move to a dorm, or just out of the houses, his life will expand so much more.\n\nYou'll be the dad he knows and trusts with his best interests if you keep up this path, so good job.", "i would have loved to have a step father like you. i\u2019m sure finn feels forgotten sometimes in the family with all of the focus being on his siblings. it\u2019s incredible that you were able to make him feel like a kid even just for one day. he has the rest of his life to be an adult. childhood only lasts for so long. quality time with a step parent is rare and i\u2019m sure he will cherish this for a while!", "Definitely NTA. \nYou can have different dates with your kids. Finn shouldn't be punished for being able to do things his siblings can't. You did an an amazing job. He needs special attention too; it just looks different than the attention the other kids get. You're a great dad. And the fact that you questioned your actions with Finn then were able to see it from other's perspectives speaks volumes. Great growth mindset, something you can use as a teachable moment with Finn.", "NTA. Great, conscientious parenting right here", "NTA at all, that\u2019s being a parent to all your kids, I am confused though why you would have to think of the half sister from his dad, except for Finn, you and your wife are not responsible for his dad\u2019s family", "You're definitely not the AH. It was wonderful for you to take Finn out & I hope there are more trips with him planned. The rest of the adults are the giant AHs. Just because his siblings couldn't have gone shouldn't preclude Finn from going", "NTA. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and block all the haters.", "NTA. \n\nI will point one thing out first.\nPeople saying you left your son behind and didn't show regard to him. \nDon't listen to them. \nYou did exactly show a lot of thought for him by not bringing him. You didn't force him into a space with huge crowds.\nHe could have a day with mom that suits his needs while you focused on the other child and gave him what he needs. Sole attention. \nThat is good parenting. So please, both you and your wife, pat yourself on the shoulders. You did the right thing. \nYou saw both their needs. \n\nEven within a sibling flock without any special needs. There will be times where not all siblings go. \nMy mom would take me clothes shopping and have iced coffee as a teen. While my brother preferred going to other places. Just the two of them. \nAnd neither of us felt unseen or felt it was unfair. We were just different and liked different things. \n\nKids have different needs and different interests. \nThis is a day he will always remember. And he will remember you saw him and what he needed. \nThere is no unfairness in it at all.", "You brought joy to another human being. That means you are NTA. God bless you all.", "NTA \n\nQuite the opposite, you are a complete hero!  The glass children get overlooked too often and something like this is completely perfect. \n\nShame on the others who are fussing, don't listen to them, and if they start in on Finn, stomp that out quickly.  They really think Finn should give up things he can do because someone else can't.  By that logic, no one in the world would ever do anything.  We all have different abilities and gifts.  No one should stop one person from doing something they can because someone else can't.  \n\nKeep doing what you're doing.  Maybe make it a monthly thing, or bi-monthly, fun day with Finn, you can switch out with your wife.  It may help Finn not need counseling in the future from being a glass child.", "What the hell is wrong with you people?! Thank you OP for being the only one of all These ah (even his parents) who actually Sees and Cares about Finn. This poor Boy get's punished his whole Life because of his siblings. And every single one is in to Hit into him. OP please stay Strong and please Help this poor Boy. He also deserves happyness. It's Not fair that He is always the ah because He is healthy.  \n\nPlease also watch Out for His mental health", "NTA. Thank you for 1 time standing up for your stepson and giving him a good outing. He is being punished for being normal by both his father and his mother. He should be able to do things that his sister can't do. He should be able to have friends over even though his other sister is autistic.  \n\nAt 18 or younger, he is going to take off and NEVER see either family again.", "NTA\n\nIt really sucks to not be able to do all the things that most folks can. I feel for your daughter in a wheelchair. That's neither a fair hand, nor an easy hand to play. \n\nI feel for your younger son as well. They have a long, challenging road ahead. \n\nBut, I feel for Finn just as much as everyone else. He's been denied a normal childhood. His ability to make and keep friends has been curtailed. His opportunities to speak up for his own wants, needs, and desires sound few and far between. He probably gets less time, attention, and understanding from most of the adults in his life. \n\nDoes Finn need to be patient and supportive of his siblings? Of course. It's a healthy expectation to care for your family. But, it's critical that the family take care of *all* it's members, whatever life circumstances they may have. \n\nLetting Finn be a normal kid is nothing more than letting him be a normal kid. Anyone who says otherwise is putting WAY too much responsibility on a 15yo kid. \n\nSounds like you might have to make some people mad in order to do what's best for Finn. So be it.", "NTA, even ignoring the siblings\u2019 needs Finn is a teenager and should be able to do things the children can\u2019t do", "NTA!!! You are an amazing stepfather for recognizing that Finn needed a chance to be a kid. He has suffered enough due to his siblings' restrictions due to their disabilities. Sorry, but one of the realities of life is that you can't necessarily do everything that someone else can do.  Randy and his wife are not helping their daughter and yours and your wife's parents are not helping your son by restricting Finn's activities. They're only hurting Finn. He is his own person and should be given the opportunities to be a kid and have fun.

It will be good bonding for all of you. There are a lot of activities you can do that don't cost a lot of money from half a day to a full day.\n\nI think it would also be good to plan an evening activity with stepson (perhaps fortnightly or once a month alternating with a day out) where after the 6yo has gone to bed you, him and his mom spend the evening together in the house, film night, board games etc (some libraries offer board game rentals). (You could do an extended version or an alternate night that includes the 6yo until his bedtime if suitable). this would give you time to bond and focus on him.\n\nI think you should also consider looking it to oppourtunities for siblings of kids with disabilities like summer camps etc it would be good for him to make friends with people in similar situations.\n\nAs you have realised that stepson isn't getting enough attention I'm sure you've also realised that your youngest is taking up a lot of everyone's time and attention. Perhaps it's needed to look into ways of getting extra help and time for everyone to have self care so that everyone stays healthy and the relationships do too. Whilst it's important to save for when he is older it's also important to have the help in place in.\n\nPerhaps stepson should attend some therapy. There is a lot of very heavy stuff in his life. He could use an adult to advocate just for him.\n\nI'm not an expert, but I believe there are courses people can take to teach them to be good caretakers of children with autism. Perhaps this is something the grandparents could do to be able to help out. It's always good to have  backups in place for when it's needed. Emergencies important events, etc. In a few years, Stepson is gonna graduate. You both need to be there for him. Who is gonna take him to visit colleges and drop him off?

Almost all of it was because George had a complication and needed to be taken ti the hospital.\n\nI left home for college and never came back. They would only ask me to return on special occasions like Christmas or my birthday but I never came back. So we have an almost nonexistent relationship. They know almost nothing about my life.\n\nGeorge passed away 3 days ago. My parents have been calling me, asking me to come to his funeral and be there for my brother and family. They also asked me to visit when they learned he was critically ill. Then and now, I said I won't make it and I told them to go on without me. My mother told me she was disappointed in me and said I was making a huge mistake and being disrespectful to my brother's memory.\n\nMy girlfriend(27F) also said I may be acting too emotionally and that I may feel better after the funeral and having closure.

So what you did was fair for him.\n\nSiblings stayed home with their other parents, where they were safe and comfortable. They didn't miss out on anything because it isn't something that they would want to do. And you took your eldest to do something for them. That is being fair, and in all honesty, if it is something that can be accomplished once or twice a month(with you or another parent) I bet you will see such a difference in you stepson you'd be  amazed. And it doesn't always have to be big trips. It could be an afternoon at the movies or a coffee and a walk around a park you will be amazed at how much stronger the bond between you all and him are, and how much less frustrated he will be in terms of dealing with the \"we can't do this due to xyz accommodation for sibling\" because he knows that you all are making an effort to bond with him and take his needs and interests into account. \n\nAnd anyone who says shit against you spending 1 on 1 time with him can go take a walk on the highway.

Everyone in your family, with the exception of your wife, and expecting Finn to be miserable so that he can accommodate the misery of his siblings. There's no other way to put it. Now I don't understand why his sister couldn't go to an amusement park or some other event like that, but that's not relevant to the situation. Even though you are his stepdad, you are still in many ways acting as his dad and his biological dad is an asshole if he thinks his son should suffer with no life and no friends and no fun experiences just because he has two disabled siblings. The way they've been treating him he is probably begun to resent his two siblings and at some point would either to lash out with behavioral issues or move away when he turned 18 so we could try to have a normal life. You might not be able to do this all the time, and you should try to include the daughter as well if possible, but don't punish the oldest child for the disabilities of the youngers", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for that kid. He NEEDS to be just that, a kid, and not be punished for his siblings struggles. You helped that kid a lot more than you can imagine.

I have tears in my eyes and I bet Finn remembers that day for the rest of his life as a shining beacon of happiness.\n\nFinn should not be punished for being a kid because his siblings have limitations.

You are my hero.\n\nYour stepson is not just the older brother of a disabled sister or an autistic brother. He is a person in his own right and deserves to be treated as such. He did not cause the disability or autism so should not be deprived of an ordinary life just because his brother and sister will not have one.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for all the animosity sent in your direction is guilt. You have done more for your stepson than his blood relations have. Carry on giving him the attention he needs and deserves.", "NTA and please don't let everyone's negative responses keep you from doing it again! Like seriously good job man. You should make it a tradition even if it's only once a year. Find little things he can do with just you or his mom occasionally. No reason that any of the kids can't have a special day to do an activity just for them based on their needs and abilities.", "NTA. Finn was miserable because he was expected to be an adult about everything, or was simply forgotten under the issues his siblings have. Giving him that day to just be a kid? That was amazing. Something he really, truly needed, and honestly, it should be a continuous thing, where once a week you guys do something just with Finn, or something. Doesn't have to be expensive, it can be as simple as a movie night or something. But he needs that time to just be a kid and have one on one time with at least one parent/step-parent. \n\nI feel for the other kids, especially the girl who is fully aware of what she's missing out on. But Finn is well on his way to resenting his siblings, as well as all the adults in his life. He needs to know it's okay to act his age and have fun, and that his adult family members care about him just as much as his siblings. He wasn't getting that until you took him out.\n\nHere's how this will work if you don't help Finn be a kid and have a parental to connect with one on one - Finn will turn 18, move out and cut contact. You'll lose him completely. That one day you gave him has done a great deal of good, here, making it less likely Finn will just disappear as soon as he becomes an adult.\n\nI'm also concerned about what the adults are expecting out of Finn going forward. You and your wife are preparing for the future, so that your autistic child will be well taken care of in a home that fits his needs. But what are the other side expecting from Finn in regards to his sister? You don't say how independant she is or can be, just that she's in a wheelchair and has issues related to that. Are that side of the family expecting Finn to support her as an adult, especially when her parents no longer can? \n\nToo much adult responsibility has been dropped on the shoulders of a child. Finn can't cope with that, and shouldn't have to. Continue making time for him, allow him to be a kid and connect properly with you and his mum. He'll love you both for it all the more, as he does understand the difficulties here. \n\nStand up to these idiots on both sides who think children should be forced to act like adults. Finn is not a parent, he's a child. He has no choice but to make some sacrifices due to his siblings issues, but he shouldn't have to sacrifice his entire childhood for them. He's allowed to do things he enjoys that his siblings are unable to do. It's not his fault they can't join him, and it's up to the parents to find things those kids can do and enjoy, and not force Finn to do them if he doesn't want to. \n\nYou're doing great. You spotted an issue and started fixing it in a way that works for your family and your situation. Your wife appears to be on your side, and please make time for her to spend with Finn, too, while you take care of the autistic child, she'll appreciate the break and the chance to connect properly with Finn. Everyone else is so in the wrong. They're not thinking about Finn at all and they need to back the hell off and stop forcing Finn to take on responsibilities and make sacrifices that harm him and aren't his to take/make. He's not an adult who chose this life, he's just a kid. Continue letting him be a kid.", "You did a great thing for Finn. He will remember that for the rest of his life. That you took him somewhere special and for just him. You put him first for the first time in a long time. Yes his siblings won\u2019t experience the same things as him. But he shouldn\u2019t be punished because he isn\u2019t sick. I\u2019d cut everyone out of your business is long time. And Randy and his wife can suck it!", "NTA. Geez. This is why we can\u2019t have nice things. \ud83d\ude02 No you did nothing wrong. You were bonding with the kid. You\u2019ll do something else for the other kids I\u2019m sure. Not everything needs to be same same.", "Tell them if they continue to treat him as they are doing now they will lose him the moment he can be on his own. And when both sets of parents are not here they shouldn't expect him to even visit his half siblings even  occasionally. They are building hatred for the other kids inside him . If he turns out to love them it's because he is that good", "NTA - even if all of the mentioned kids had the same abilities, it would still be fine to have 1:1 time with them. Finn did something he wanted, now the others can pick something they want to and kate/randy can take them. You can't punish Finn for his siblings not being able to do things.", "NTA.  in fact YOU were the BEST parent of all described.  I cannot believe finn does not hold resentment to his half siblings.   Why should he be held back, he is not disabled and should not be treated as such.\nWill there be an account to take care of him for the rest of his life?  Life is not always fair,  it is heartbreaking when you have a child that can not participate as others do and is saddened when they realize it, but they are doing their daughter no favors by shielding her from all disappoinments.", "So, no one can have fun because of their disabilities.", "NTA\n\nYou are Finn's advocate and someone he needs desperately. Do it again, and again, and again.....", "NTA and thank you for doing that. You have no idea what you just did for Finn. You gave him hope and love and experience and he will carry it with him always. Keep it up, Finn needs you to \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nAll of these people are absolutely awful. Yes your younger child and the other younger child has medical needs that restrict their ability to do things. Yes that is totally unfair. But to demand Finn not experience these things and not have friends and not be a kid and so on just because of that? That\u2019s a real easy way to make sure he absolutely detests his siblings, father, and grandparents.\n\nI\u2019d ask them flat out if they truly want Finn to grow up resenting his siblings and family and cut them off. Because if that\u2019s the path they continue to take, I can 100% guarantee you that will happen. It\u2019s time they get a wake up call that all of them are playing favorites and shoving this poor kid to the side solely because he\u2019s healthy and they\u2019re going to come to regret that later.", "These sick people want to punish Finn for being the normal child?  The time for being grateful will come later, but he needs a father figure to put him first once on a while.  His own Dad isn\u2019t stepping up.  Keep doing this once a month with your wife\u2019s support (maybe keep the fun, pizza parties or taking the kid to a movie under your hat since the rest of his family wants him to feel guilty for something not under his control). \n\nYou set a good example of what a loving stepfather should be - someone a kid can trust.  Kate is lucky to have you.", "So NTA unless you don\u2019t explicitly take time to explain to the 8yo that sometimes different people get to do different fun things. Finn had a great time, and ideally she would feel happy for him (big ask for anyone let alone a kid though)\n\nAsk her to imagine getting to do the most fun thing in the world. Get her to describe what it was. Now get her to imagine how she\u2019d want her friends and family to feel if they didn\u2019t get to do it too. Sometimes we don\u2019t get to do the fun things and we feel jealous, and that\u2019s normal. But it\u2019s a valuable life skill to learn how to tell our brains that hey - we like our family member/friend/whoever it is so the fact that they got to do something fun doesn\u2019t mean our life sucks.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s in a wheelchair and can\u2019t go isn\u2019t actually relevant to dealing with those feelings - my able bodied kids experience them too because every single person gets different opportunities through life. In this case there is probably some ableism going on; grandparents etc are thinking of how pitiful and terrible it is that she\u2019s in a chair and so that makes being left out feel somehow worse. But a lot of disabled people like their lives the way they are. Our feelings about people who can\u2019t walk are often tied to how we think we\u2019d feel if we couldn\u2019t walk. But that part is likely normal to the kid, especially if she was born with her disability. Also amusement parks aren\u2019t usually out of the question for people in a wheelchair. In your shoes I\u2019d refuse to engage in the topic anymore. \u201cSorry you feel that way but Finn and I had a great time and it was a parenting choice I\u2019m not prepared to discuss any further.\u201d I might suggest a new tradition of taking Finn places, and you could do same with other two. One on one time with Dad is super valuable. And no, you don\u2019t have to go to the same places with each kid or only go altogether.", "NTA if you don\u2019t mind reading I\u2019m going to share my own story with this.\n\nI come from a mother who had an older sister that lived in a medical facility and died when my mom was around 11. My mom also had a older brother with Juvenile diabetes this was back in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s. There was a lot of sacrifices my mom and her two other brothers had to make growing up. When my mom had kids of her own the trams she went through affected us.\n\nI was the younger sibling with medical issues. I was too young to know at the time since I was under the age of 2. Due to this my stay at home mom had to juggle my healthier older sister and me. There were times where I would have to go somewhere during the day for therapy while my sister was babysat. It was rough on them. When I got better my mom tried to over compensate for her lack of attention to my sister.  Since she didn\u2019t get time with her sister she forced all interactions to be about sister now.  Oh you don\u2019t want to do ballet well tough luck your sister wants it.  Things like that my mom tried to have me do the life she never had. I was the opposite of my sister and ignored once I started school. \n\nYou are doing great all three children are people.

Everyone is so focused on the children whose disabilities they can't see that they are disregarding the mental health of the child who has no physical disabilities.\n\n You probably did more for his mental health in that one day than the other adults have done since the others were born.

I guess, if it was mentioned accidentally there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, but I lived with lots of cousins when I was little and can\u2019t remember all that many times that we knew exactly what coveted activity the other kids went to with their parents that we were missing out on. It would just be that parent and kid \u201cwent out\u201d, often that they were \u201crunning errands\u201d. Especially with significantly younger cousins, what would be the point in bringing it up around them? I can think of very few times that the teen cousins told the younger ones exactly what they did when they went out and even fewer when my older siblings (with chunky age gaps) told me what they were doing, with or without parents, when I wasn\u2019t invited or able to do the same.", "NTA.

During the week, primary caretaking fell to my SAHM mom; on weekends, my dad, uncle, and aunt took over. We had a lot of babysitters. As a military family we were used to our dad being absent, but not our mom.\n\nI have zero recollection of chronology, but at some point my mom decided she needed more kid-facing time. She told us she  was sorry she was so busy, and that one Saturday a month, she would take just one of us out for lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon doing whatever we wanted. (I always chose a turkey sandwich and the library.) Until our next move a year and change later, she continued to spend one Saturday afternoon a month with just one of us. It was dependable and definite, marked in advance on the calendar. \n\nThose days were some of the best in my childhood. We didn't do anything amazing or extravagant, and she was more chaperone than participant for most activities, but decades later my brothers and I still remember those days, when we basked in our mom's undivided attention. Basked until we felt it in our bones: we were loved, we were seen, we were treasured. We were safe.\n\nI think she saw that as the time she spent with decreased, we needed reassurance we could still depend on her. Scheduling a regular time alone with each of us gave us that concretely. I think it also was a way for her to make sure her good intentions became more than just intentions.\n\nAnd I've dragged you down this memory lane because i think it has parallels to your situation. Of course Finn's siblings get a lot of undivided attention because they have some special needs, understood. But Finn deserves and needs some of that as well. He's 15, so you and Kate and Randy have only a little time left to make sure Finn knows, to his bones, that he's treasured and safe. \n\nAlso -- all of us have limitations, physical and neurological: I'll never be able to reach the top shelf, see without corrective lenses, or tolerate certain sounds and textures. Part of growing up is accepting that and understanding that life isn't fair. Part of parenting is teaching that. Teaching instead that other people shouldn't be allowed to do what your child can't do -- that's ultimately a disservice to your child.", "NTA.

You did a wonderful thing in taking him to do something just for him where he got to just be a kid.  \n\n My siblings were allowed extra activities because they had different needs, but if I wanted to do something they had to be allowed to come if they wanted.  When it was a case of they couldn't come along, my mom and grandmother would take something away from me.  Ie , I had a friend wanted to take me to an ice show, they only had 1 extra ticket, so later my siblings were taken out and I was informed that since I got to go to the ice show, I didn't get to do this other thing.

That is NOT their fault. But it isn't his either. And denying him experiences his siblings are not able to share even when it's possible will, quite frankly, only lead to him resenting his siblings.\n\nYou're being a good dad.

Even if she has a problem with large crowds going on a weekday at a smaller park when the season is winding down or off season could still be an option. It sounds like these parents are way too nervous about her doing anything.", "I have a placard on the shelf behind my toilet it says ,\"My aim is to help keep this bathroom clean. Your aim will help\"", "You meant stand up and DON'T aim, right?", "Throw some Cheerios in the bowl and let the target practice begin.", "That\u2019s funny!  I\u2019m living with my grandson and his mom.  He\u2019s a hoot with his 59/50 potty skills, but he pees sitting down!  He even wipes because we do.  I know it won\u2019t last.", "My gran had this in her bathroom when I was growing up. I've been looking for something similar since I have 2 boys whose aim is terrible.", "He needs at least once a month", "Yes.   \nThere are not only rollercoasters in the amusement parks.   \nYou won't drag me to rollercoaster for the love or money, I'm so afraid of them.   \nBut there are always some slow rides and other attractions to enjoy.   \nMy family still makes fun of me, because I freaked out in the Haunted House in Disneyland, when I saw the riding device, spending a long time in a line beforehand. I decided then that they (my SO and daughter) go ride alone and I'll go back.   \nOf course it was not possible to just \"go back\" and after wandering around there in the darkness, I finally found some staff member who let me out by their \"staff only\" exit ;).   \nAnd then my daughter and SO coming and telling me it was a gentle, slow ride, suitable for toddlers :/"]}
