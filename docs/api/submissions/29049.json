She was divorced from her ex-husband Randy and they have my stepson together Finn (15). Finn has two siblings. One from his dad, a half sister, who is 8 and is in a wheelchair. I also have a 6 year old son with Kate who is autistic.\n\nFinn's half sister has a lot of complex issues related to her disability and I am aware because of communication between Kate and Randy as well as hearing Finn talk about life there. Because of their daughter's issues, Randy and his wife do not allow Finn to do typical kid things if it would upset their daughter. He will often be told he should focus less on his friends and more on his sister, etc.\n\nKate and I are not totally innocent either. We have struggled to juggle our son's challenges while making sure Finn can still be a kid and enjoy himself and not suffer because of his sibling. Our home needs to be quiet for our son and he doesn't do good with crowds so going out as a family is not possible, even with noise cancelling headphones. Our son is very limited and will always need someone to take care of him. Kate and I started saving for that day, so that he can go into a good home when we are no longer able to take care of him. But we also try to help him learn as much as he can, so he can gain all the independence possible.\n\nFinn has struggled a lot lately and it does feel like most people in both families feel like he should be grateful for his health and for his lack of additional struggles which both siblings have. I felt horrible realizing the last few years Finn has really not experienced much of a life. I told Kate I was going to take him to an amusement park for a day and let him be a kid. I knew Kate wouldn't do it but I knew I could and should. So last week I brought him out for the day and we had such a great time. I let him go on everything he wanted, bought him all the junk food he wanted and made sure he knew he deserved to have fun and good things too. I know glass children are often forgotten or expected to be adults about everything. Finn had so much fun. He was happier than I have seen him in years.\n\nBut the reaction from others was negative. From Randy and his wife, from Kate's parents and from mine, as well as from Randy's parents. The general consensus is Finn should not have been brought to do something his siblings could not enjoy. From his dad's side it's that his half sister was heartbroken that he got to experience something she never can but wants to experience. From mine and my wife's parents it's that I left my son behind and showed a lack of regard for him. Kate spoke to her parents and told them I had done a wonderful thing for Finn and wasn't wrong to do it. I also blocked my parents because I didn't want to hear their crap.\n\nKate has been dealing with a lot of fallout from Randy and his wife too, though.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy because I seem to have become the devil to these people for what I did.

I did not consider there would be fallout. His young half sister is upset because she wanted to go and can't and is upset that my stepson got to go and had such a good time. My son isn't really aware but I didn't ever consider bringing him. I guess I could have found something for us to do as a family of four that Finn could enjoy instead of going off alone with him. These are reasons I guess I could be considered an asshole.

From his dad's side it's that his half sister was heartbroken that he got to experience something she never can but wants to experience.\n\nHe's supposed to be miserable for his whole childhood in some kind of bid to equalize the misery between siblings? That's both insane and cruel.", "NTA. Thank you so much for taking Finn out for the day! What a gift. I\u2019m sure that you made memories that he will never forget. \n\nAs far as the family drama - do they expect that Finn never does anything that his siblings can\u2019t? If your son is  nonverbal and needs constant care it is unlikely that he will marry, have children, hold a \u201cnormal\u201d job, etc \u2026 Do they expect Finn to remain single, childless, jobless, etc \u2026 just because his brother does? And I\u2019m sure that there are many things that Finn\u2019s stepsister won\u2019t be able to do due to being in a wheelchair, but that shouldn\u2019t diminish Finn\u2019s choice to do them. It sounds like he has been making selfless sacrifices on behalf of his siblings, which is commendable, but surely they would and should understand that every individual has circumstances unique to themselves that dictate what they do with their lives - mentally, physically, financially, etc \u2026 - and that even though it might not feel fair, it\u2019s life.", "NTA you did a great thing for him, and you should continue doing so in the future.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt\u2019s torture to not allow a child to do things because their disabled siblings can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s just lazy and hurtful parenting. \n\nYou are literally depriving a child of being a child when you do this.\nAll it does is create resentment in the child, which results in them leaving at 18 and NOT looking back. \n\nWhat you did was a good thing and it should be down more often for his sake.\nIf everyone expects him to walk on glass, then they need to make sure they reward him thusly for it.", "Finn is going to remember that day with you at the amusement part for the rest of his life. Good for you for doing it with him. \n\nIt sucks for his siblings that they couldn\u2019t do something like that, but telling a fifteen year old he should be grateful for his health, now sit down, be quiet, and let us spend time, money, and attention on your needier siblings- sucks for the healthy kid. He needed attention, too. NTA\n\nAnd when Finn gets old enough to GTFO, he might still talk - to *you*.", ">The general consensus is Finn should not have been brought to do something his siblings could not enjoy\n\nThat's such BS.\n\n>his half sister was heartbroken that he got to experience something she never can but wants to experience\n\nThere are wheelchair accessible amusement parks. It took me 30 seconds to find them on Google.\n\n>Randy and his wife do not allow Finn to do typical kid things if it would upset their daughter\n\nWhat's going to happen when she grows up and her parents can't stop other people from doing things she can't? They're setting her up for a life of resentment and bitterness. It sounds as though she already sees herself as a victim. They're doing her (and Finn) a huge disservice.\n\nYou sound like a great dad/stepdad. Please keep giving Finn the positive attention he needs.", "NTA. There are so many posts here written by people whose childhood was like Finn's and who turn 18 and leave home. I'm glad you recognized that these children have very different ages and needs and equal treatment doesn't always mean equitable treatment. I have no idea why everyone is ganging up on you for treating Finn well.", "Definitely NTA, if anything you should be congratulated by your family for being the only one to actually consider the child who gets the less attention all the time.  I feel they're projecting their own guilt onto you for not stepping up, and doing more stuff for your stepson. And also not being self aware enough of how much your stepson misses out on.\n\nKeep up the good work, and please carry on with the one on one with your stepson, since nobody else can be bothered with him.", "NTA, anyone who says he should miss out on being a kid for his siblings sure is though!\n\nYou did a great thing, and the fact that you're actually aware of him being forced to not have a normal childhood and doing what you can to help with that is fantastic.  Just because his siblings can't do something doesn't mean he should be unable to experience it, that will only breed resentment by him towards them and anyone that tries to box him in.  He's his own person and should get to have all those experiences, and know he's allowed to grow up and have a normal life.\n\nAlso good on you for not thinking he's the plan to take care of your other kids, I have a feeling his bio dad doesn't feel the same.  Be sure to dispel that myth.  And let him know that when it's time to go to college and he's able to move to a dorm, or just out of the houses, his life will expand so much more.\n\nYou'll be the dad he knows and trusts with his best interests if you keep up this path, so good job.", "i would have loved to have a step father like you. i\u2019m sure finn feels forgotten sometimes in the family with all of the focus being on his siblings. it\u2019s incredible that you were able to make him feel like a kid even just for one day. he has the rest of his life to be an adult. childhood only lasts for so long. quality time with a step parent is rare and i\u2019m sure he will cherish this for a while!", "Definitely NTA. \nYou can have different dates with your kids. Finn shouldn't be punished for being able to do things his siblings can't. You did an an amazing job. He needs special attention too; it just looks different than the attention the other kids get. You're a great dad. And the fact that you questioned your actions with Finn then were able to see it from other's perspectives speaks volumes. Great growth mindset, something you can use as a teachable moment with Finn.", "NTA. Great, conscientious parenting right here", "NTA at all, that\u2019s being a parent to all your kids, I am confused though why you would have to think of the half sister from his dad, except for Finn, you and your wife are not responsible for his dad\u2019s family", "You're definitely not the AH. It was wonderful for you to take Finn out & I hope there are more trips with him planned. The rest of the adults are the giant AHs. Just because his siblings couldn't have gone shouldn't preclude Finn from going", "NTA. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and block all the haters.", "NTA. \n\nI will point one thing out first.\nPeople saying you left your son behind and didn't show regard to him. \nDon't listen to them. \nYou did exactly show a lot of thought for him by not bringing him. You didn't force him into a space with huge crowds.\nHe could have a day with mom that suits his needs while you focused on the other child and gave him what he needs. Sole attention. \nThat is good parenting. So please, both you and your wife, pat yourself on the shoulders. You did the right thing. \nYou saw both their needs. \n\nEven within a sibling flock without any special needs. There will be times where not all siblings go. \nMy mom would take me clothes shopping and have iced coffee as a teen. While my brother preferred going to other places. Just the two of them. \nAnd neither of us felt unseen or felt it was unfair. We were just different and liked different things. \n\nKids have different needs and different interests. \nThis is a day he will always remember. And he will remember you saw him and what he needed. \nThere is no unfairness in it at all.", "You brought joy to another human being. That means you are NTA. God bless you all.", "NTA \n\nQuite the opposite, you are a complete hero!  The glass children get overlooked too often and something like this is completely perfect. \n\nShame on the others who are fussing, don't listen to them, and if they start in on Finn, stomp that out quickly.  They really think Finn should give up things he can do because someone else can't.  By that logic, no one in the world would ever do anything.  We all have different abilities and gifts.  No one should stop one person from doing something they can because someone else can't.  \n\nKeep doing what you're doing.  Maybe make it a monthly thing, or bi-monthly, fun day with Finn, you can switch out with your wife.  It may help Finn not need counseling in the future from being a glass child.", "What the hell is wrong with you people?! Thank you OP for being the only one of all These ah (even his parents) who actually Sees and Cares about Finn. This poor Boy get's punished his whole Life because of his siblings. And every single one is in to Hit into him. OP please stay Strong and please Help this poor Boy. He also deserves happyness. It's Not fair that He is always the ah because He is healthy.  \n\nPlease also watch Out for His mental health", "NTA. Thank you for 1 time standing up for your stepson and giving him a good outing. He is being punished for being normal by both his father and his mother. He should be able to do things that his sister can't do. He should be able to have friends over even though his other sister is autistic.  \n\nAt 18 or younger, he is going to take off and NEVER see either family again.", "NTA\n\nIt really sucks to not be able to do all the things that most folks can. I feel for your daughter in a wheelchair. That's neither a fair hand, nor an easy hand to play. \n\nI feel for your younger son as well. They have a long, challenging road ahead. \n\nBut, I feel for Finn just as much as everyone else. He's been denied a normal childhood. His ability to make and keep friends has been curtailed. His opportunities to speak up for his own wants, needs, and desires sound few and far between. He probably gets less time, attention, and understanding from most of the adults in his life. \n\nDoes Finn need to be patient and supportive of his siblings? Of course. It's a healthy expectation to care for your family. But, it's critical that the family take care of *all* it's members, whatever life circumstances they may have. \n\nLetting Finn be a normal kid is nothing more than letting him be a normal kid. Anyone who says otherwise is putting WAY too much responsibility on a 15yo kid. \n\nSounds like you might have to make some people mad in order to do what's best for Finn. So be it.", "NTA, even ignoring the siblings\u2019 needs Finn is a teenager and should be able to do things the children can\u2019t do", "NTA!!! You are an amazing stepfather for recognizing that Finn needed a chance to be a kid. He has suffered enough due to his siblings' restrictions due to their disabilities. Sorry, but one of the realities of life is that you can't necessarily do everything that someone else can do.  Randy and his wife are not helping their daughter and yours and your wife's parents are not helping your son by restricting Finn's activities. They're only hurting Finn. He is his own person and should be given the opportunities to be a kid and have fun. I hope Kate is speaking up for you and saying that this trip was about Finn and it was what he needed.", "NTA, what does your autistic son say, that is really all that matters.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
