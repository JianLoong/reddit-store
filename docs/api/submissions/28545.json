This isn\u2019t absolving him of his words but is most likely a reflection of who he is internally and taking it out on you. His attempt to reach out could be fake or real but that is beside the point since the deed is done. Regarding you though, in the end forgiveness is the absolute best route due to the fact that this sort of weight emotionally follows you around and whether or not you see the impact, it exists and is bringing you down. Took me a long time to realize forgiveness is not necessarily about the other person who did you wrong and absolving them of their misdeeds but most importantly so you can heal and regain the piece of you they tried to steal by hurting you. I understand the anger/frustration one can hold over time that builds into resentment regarding a brother says thing that cut deep and in turn you may want to reciprocate with words to hurt him so he knew how you felt that day. For context I lost my younger brother after he overdosed last April and the last time we spoke was a couple years prior\u2026 our last interaction left me with lot of anger, frustration, jaded and a thought I never wanted to see him again after the umpteenth time he lashed out. My long winded point being is that, all those feelings you are harboring will take a toll on you over the course of time whether you realize it or not but anger for example is a very heavy weight you are carrying around and there is no guarantee there will an opportunity for you to heal by means of forgiveness allowing you to move on and potentially mend a relationship with your brother who has potentially changed but you won\u2019t know until vetted as it stand today. People make mistakes and say things they regret especially when they are younger going through the motions of life. What he said is certainly unbecoming but he has no bearing on the women you are with and how they think nor feel unless you let it\u2026 don\u2019t confuse what he said with who you are. Taking the  route to open one\u2019s heart to facilitate forgiveness will make you a better person and certainly not weak. Forgiveness takes strength that far surpasses the immature insults slung at you and is an opportunity for your own growth that maybe your brother/family will see but either way it is a means to an end for the damage you received so you can heal. Forgiving doesn\u2019t necessitate forgetting but alleviating the weight you\u2019re carrying around and mending the wound. Time is still permitting you with opportunities before that ship sails it appears. You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette - good luck bud.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know this upset my mum and younger brother but I just know I never want to see him again there no way that you can tell your mum that you don\u2019t want to have a relationship with a sibling or close family member and her to be ok with it unless she is also cutting contact with the same person. Your mum will come around eventually but for the moment give her a little time and space as you have just told her that the little bit of hope she had of having her children having a good relationship with each other.", "Nta. Even if you were in speaking terms with your bro yiu could visit other places. I'm highly allergic to cats and have never demanded anyone NOT to have one. I visit elsewhere, or take precautions to minimize my reaction.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you see your brother or not. You wanted a cat and you got one. I\u2019m severely allergic to cats and my brother and sister-in-law got one. I do go to their home a few times a year and just have to take precautions to be there (they keep their cat away, I have clothes to change into for my drive home, we keep the doors and windows open). Your brother\u2019s allergies are not your problem if you ever do allow him in your home.", "NTA   Moms, like me, want their children to get along, and that hope never dies.  That said, why would your brother Ever have to be at your home?  There are many other places to meet should you want to do that.  Mom needs to step back and allow adult you and your adult brother handle your own business.", "Even if you wanted to see your brother, there's a whole lot of other places to meet him, other than your place... what is it with people thinking animals are disposable? Take an antihistamine ffs.", "NTA and your mom is bananas.\n\nEven if you and your brother were super-tight, you are still allowed to have a cat! And most cat allergies are mild\u2014sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes. You could still meet him outside your house.", "NTA. Your parents allowed your older brother to be cruel to you your whole childhood. They don't get to demand you repair that broken relationship now. He missed his chance, and you're not interested in knowing him right now. Maybe that will change in the future and if it does, there's a whole world of other places besides your house to visit with him. Enjoy your cat.", "A family member you *actually like* but doesn't live with you having a cat allergy isn't even a reason to get rid of a cat. NTA.", "NTA Your house, your rules. Even if you were to reunite, nobody gets to dictate the pets you have. You could get a dozen cats if you wanted to, it's YOUR house. Your mom is being ridiculous.", "NTA as you're just never supposed to have a life of your own bc he has a allergy? You can have your own cat even if you weren't in this situation. I will say the reason for the no contact seems a bit smaller.  Don't brothers and sisters always do that kind of stuff to each other? Understand being mad and maybe talking through it so he can see how it hurts you when he does that stuff but no contact? Not sure about that IMO. But for this situation,  NTA.", "NTA", "  should try to be considerate of her feelings \n\nNTA OP.  To me, telling me that I SHOULD do something is fighting words.  Your mom is TA, big time.", "> My mom got really upset at me, saying I should be try to be considerate of her feelings.\n\nthat is known as 'emotional blackmail'.", "I need a follow up please", "Hahaha nope. If I may recommend though, think about adopting two cats. They will keep each other company and it\u2019s double the cuteness and antics. \n\nNTA.", "NTA but you need to adopt more cats. Become the crazy cat dad", "NTA. Kitty needs a home!", "NTA\n\nGuests don't get to dictate what pets you have. We know who the favorite is.", "Nta.   My mom constantly trying to make me care about my brother. It will never happen, esp after he told my sister, who had had 3 miscarriags, to have an abortion because her baby was due to close to his bday.  What is funny to me in my situation is mom has disowned one of her brothers but apparently my sister and I are not able to disown ours.\n\nIt is perfectly alright to be no contact with people.", "Exactly this!! OP is NTA for living his life and creating a home with his girlfriend in the way they see fit.\n\nBut let's pretend...let's say that OP and his brother do reconcile. I can say from my own experience with an on again off again estranged sister (mostly her choice to run away from accountability and on one occasion my choice to protect my sanity and heart) that the beginnings of the reconciliation are very tentative and rarely happen at either party's safe place. OP inviting his brother over to his place and vice versa is highly unlikely, at least in the beginning. There are neutral locations, like a restaurant, a park or mom's place, that they can go to.\n\nAnd even if OP and his brother were good, why should the brother dictate how OP lives in his own home?? Purely speculation here, but what if OP wanted a cat his whole life and couldn't because his brother was allergic? OP is allowed to have a cat, full stop.", "True, my BIL is allergic to cats.. we always had cats, and he pops a benedryl if needed when he visits. Mum is wildly out of her rights to demand anyone getting rid of a pet because someone allergic might visit one day.", "Or let his brother in to ambush him.", "[removed]", "Every time she complains about it, add another cat.", "You can forgive someone and still not want them in your life if they're still acting the same old way. Which is where it sounds like OP is. He's not angry. He just isn't willing to be around his brother. I'm guessing Brother hasn't changed much, so why would OP want him around?", "Or better do a \u201cNigel\u201d ( or whatever brother\u2019s name is) and \u201cHuman Nigel\u201d for the brother.", "Why should OP make any effort? His bro sounds shit. OP own his family nothing regarding his brother. Dear mom should have raised a decent human being and not cry about it now.

His brother apologised. OP says he doesn't hate him anymore. He just doesn't care about him. Also just because someone says sorry you are not obligated to to forgive at all.

OP's bro looks like someone who just doesn't worth it...", "I'm also most allergic to Persians! I've never heard anyone else say that though.

Every day is an adventure with what they get up to. Much nicer than toxic relatives", "We don't know anything about his brother or his mother other than what the OP told us. I didn't say anything about forgetting.

And mine too.", "I think it makes complete sense to cut someone out of your life if all they dobis try to cut you down, especially in your lowest moment. Why would you spend your time and energy to maintain a relationship with someone who holds so little love and empathy for you that they'd insult you after you got cheated on?\n\nAnd an apology isn't at all proof that he's willing to change and actually treat OP better.", "We cannot do anything but rely on what OP said and decide who is the AH if there's any. Based on what he said his brother sucks and his mother thinks her feelings are more important than OP's.\n\nAgain OP is not obligated to accept his apology his brother not only made fun of him once but did it for years. Dear Mom either did nothing about it or definitely didn't try hard enough.\n\nIt's not your place to decide whether the demage done by OP's brother is so deep that OP cannot leave it behind. Only OP feels it. And if he feels that his brother doesn't deserve to be part of his life anymore, he is NTA for it because it's more than understandable.", "You're assuming a lot about this person without any additional context, tbf. There's a lot we don't know, so it seems foolish to fill in the gaps ourselves. What you're talking about is also too far in the other direction - what energy is required to just be civil if their paths cross? He doesn't need to be all in on the relationship or NC, that again, is foolish.", "Of course it is -  the OP solicited opinions and I gave mine, just like you have yours. Tbh, I think it's a bit worrying that someone's threshold for cutting someone they are related to out of their life completely is so low. Christ knows how they'd deal with something seriously bad.", ">You're assuming a lot about this person without any additional context, tbf.\n\nWhat am I assuming? All I said about the brother was what OP himself said in the post: that the brother made fun of OP for years and even worse, continued to insult OP when he was cheated on. \n\n>what energy is required to just be civil if their paths cross? He doesn't need to be all in on the relationship or NC, that again, is foolish.\n\nOP says in a comment that his parents never really host any family events, so it's not like OP is deliberately avoiding the brother at the cost of other relationships in his life. Since OP isn't holding a grudge, I'm inclined to believe he would be civil, if distant, if he ever encountered his brother again.", "OP asked whether he should have been more gentle or whether he should gave more value to his mom's feelings. He did not ask whether cutting out his brother from his life was an AH move.\n\nI am not old. Only 25, yet my life is so busy that I am happy when I have time for people I actually care for. Cutting out unnecessary and toxic people is really good to your mental health by the way.", "If he didn't hold a grudge, then why has he blocked him and gone NC? Of course he's holding a grudge and it's clearly upsetting his mother.

It's all related.\n\nI'm late 30s and as I said, have been in a similar situation to the OP.", ">If he didn't hold a grudge, then why has he blocked him and gone NC?\n\nBc that's what you do when you don't want to submit yourself to the presence of someone who tries to hurt you? I mean, would you keep in contact with someone who repeatedly make fun of you and hurt you when you're feeling bad or would you go \"yeah, this isn't a relationship worth keeping\" and stop talking to them? You don't have to hold a grudge against someone to just not want to hear from them."]}
