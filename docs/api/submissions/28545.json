This isn\u2019t absolving him of his words but is most likely a reflection of who he is internally and taking it out on you. His attempt to reach out could be fake or real but that is beside the point since the deed is done. Regarding you though, in the end forgiveness is the absolute best route due to the fact that this sort of weight emotionally follows you around and whether or not you see the impact, it exists and is bringing you down. Took me a long time to realize forgiveness is not necessarily about the other person who did you wrong and absolving them of their misdeeds but most importantly so you can heal and regain the piece of you they tried to steal by hurting you. I understand the anger/frustration one can hold over time that builds into resentment regarding a brother says thing that cut deep and in turn you may want to reciprocate with words to hurt him so he knew how you felt that day. For context I lost my younger brother after he overdosed last April and the last time we spoke was a couple years prior\u2026 our last interaction left me with lot of anger, frustration, jaded and a thought I never wanted to see him again after the umpteenth time he lashed out. My long winded point being is that, all those feelings you are harboring will take a toll on you over the course of time whether you realize it or not but anger for example is a very heavy weight you are carrying around and there is no guarantee there will an opportunity for you to heal by means of forgiveness allowing you to move on and potentially mend a relationship with your brother who has potentially changed but you won\u2019t know until vetted as it stand today. People make mistakes and say things they regret especially when they are younger going through the motions of life. What he said is certainly unbecoming but he has no bearing on the women you are with and how they think nor feel unless you let it\u2026 don\u2019t confuse what he said with who you are. Taking the  route to open one\u2019s heart to facilitate forgiveness will make you a better person and certainly not weak. Forgiveness takes strength that far surpasses the immature insults slung at you and is an opportunity for your own growth that maybe your brother/family will see but either way it is a means to an end for the damage you received so you can heal. Forgiving doesn\u2019t necessitate forgetting but alleviating the weight you\u2019re carrying around and mending the wound. Time is still permitting you with opportunities before that ship sails it appears. You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette - good luck bud.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
