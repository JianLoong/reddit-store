It's very popular and thus very competitive. Especially since COVID lockdowns ended there have been a lot of layoffs at big companies like Microsoft and Spotify which effects the whole field. After all when you suddenly have 1,000+ people with a big name on their resume, and the skills to back it up it looking for jobs after being laid off everyone who doesn't have all that are going to struggle. Plus you have new grads with shiny new degrees joining the workforce every semester which looks way nicer than being self taught or a coding boot camp to many employers. \n\n\n\nBasically if he wants to get into tech he should be starting to learn sooner rather than later.

I have a friend who was in college and the person she was dating was working at a restaurant. She moved on and got her mba, while he was still working at the restaurant. She started her first career job and at Fortune 500 company, he was still at the restaurant. They got married, had kids, she moved on to another large brand company and he was still at the restaurant. They have been married over 15 years and only recently in 2020 did he lose his job because the restaurant had to close. He then used the next three years to not work and say he was needed to be home to help the kids through homeschooling during covid and only recently was handed a job at a catering company. He is 55 years old and will never change. What's hard about this is that she never fully accepted it and it's caused a lot of tension and fights in their marriage especially when she's working with people more successful and younger than him. Her bosses are younger than him! What you need to decide is if you're okay with the way things are now because he is 33 years old and this is it, you absolutely have to accept him for who he is and have to accept that this truly is it. Are you going to be happy with that? That is a question you need to ask yourself.", "NTA. It isn't a career. So isn't bartending.", "NTA - you delivered your concern kindly. I suspect he is lying to himself to get through the day.", "Dump that loser lmao", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, if he wants to work gig work like that for the rest of his life, there's no inherent shame in that. And you probably shouldn't have talked down about it on a mostly irrelevant point of it being something \"people do because they don\u2019t have other options\"; although he clearly does feel some shame if he's upset about it not being called a \"career\". \n\nHowever, instead of focusing on what you call what he does, you need to have a conversation about where your lives are going and what your financial expectations are for your future together. What is the end goal of a 5 year plan and what milestones and deadlines need to be met to get there in that time span and if he's willing to work towards them at the correct pace. \n\nSecondly, he's 33 and living in a fantasy land where he can just \"get into tech\" without a single qualification? Do you really buy that? Or do you think maybe he has no intention of ever doing that; it's just something he can say when pressed about his future goals that can somewhat be passed off as plausible. If he hasn't made any effort to work towards his own future, much less the future you imagine the two of you building, in the 4 years you've been together he needs to get a start on it now (there's literally no reason not to if his schedule is so flexible)... Or you need to stop letting him string you along.", "It all depends on how you communicated the information.  On the one hand it is reasonable for you to have these concerns.  On the other hand, he is well within his rights to make his own decisions about his own life.  Only after you are married or have kids are you really obligated to compromise and even then you can't truly force anyone too.\n\nSo, if you were 100% respectful in delivering your concerns, then NTA.  But if it turned into a big blow out fight then it's highly likely both of you acted like ass holes.  It takes two to tango.", "NTA. People are mentioning upwards mobility but it's more than that. It's the opportunity for growing skill sets, increasing income, and moving toward autonomy that define a career. Uber driving will do none of that for him. The job is thoroughly unskilled and inherently discourages development (since you literally cannot do anything else while driving). The pay is consistently low, will never reliably increase, and comes with terrible taxes and gas/maintenance costs. And you will never achieve autonomy working as a contractor for a heartless megacorp with so much unilateral leverage.\n\nIt's totally fine that he discovered Uber pays more and changed jobs (although I truly am dubious after costs and taxes, and think maybe the bartending gig could have evolved into a better paying establishment). But viewing this as a career and not a stepping stone is setting some painfully precarious standards of living. He should be using Uber to get to the next thing, not developing Stockholm Syndrome for it.\n\nPut another way: a self-employed career is when you manage contracts with different clients. If you only have one client, and *especially* when that client makes their money off exploiting employment law in exactly the way they are employing you, you are not in control of your \"career\". You are a bloodbag feeding a cancerous tumor, and no one should be romanticizing that in the way Nate is.\n\nI would have a serious talk with him, and if he can't see how problematic this is I would leave him.

If he admits that he\u2019s already achieved his goals and is comfortable where he is, he knows it\u2019ll probably be the end of this relationship.", "not saying this is industry standard but when i waitressed we had sick leave, 401k, disability, etc. - none of which are offered to uber drivers. the issue seems to be downside protection, which he\u2019s more likely to get as a bartender than an uber driver.", "I think with bartender, there is more of a chance to climb up to be bar manager, beverage director, etc. You get to make loads of connections at the bar that will eventually land you other jobs (I know Uber drivers land a job through their riders they meet daily but that's usually not the case and you've have to be very lucky, it's more chance than skill set). There's also an employer with ability to give you raises, or keep you in check with your quality of work.", "Yes. Bartender is a skilled job where you can make quite a bit of money, not to mention manager or even own a bar, and if you\u2019re good with cocktails, mixologists are close to being equivalent to chefs in some places. \n\nNot only is Uber not a career by any stretch but it also has diminishing returns the more you do it (because you\u2019re spending more on gas and wear on your car).", "bartenders can make really good money\u2026.", "I'm gonna take the stance that neither is a career.", "I need to tell all of the travel nurses I work with that they don\u2019t have a legit career based on OP\u2019s criteria.", "If he is happy what\u2019s the big deal\u2026", "Try this. Sit down and figure out how much you guys will need to make and save to get that house and retire someday. Break it down into how much you need per day and week to really accomplish the goal in a reasonable amount of time. Then figure out if he does or can make that much. If he can and does, great, you don't have any problems outside of thinking lowly about gig work. If he can't, then he needs to upgrade. Also, with your grad school job, how much do you make per day? Can he make at least that much? I bet he can.", "I'm not mad that he went from being a bartender to driving for Uber. He was good at being a bartender, had set work hours and an employer keeping him accountable, and no wear and tear on the car plus the ability to move up in the beverage industry if he wants to.  \nI'm upset that he is now driving Uber full time (the pay is about the same as bartending , but its before factoring in tax/gas/wear&tear. once you factor those in, Uber pay is below min wage), pretending that it pays the same as bartending and is a solid career and that he can 'get into tech' whenever he chooses to.", "He's a cab driver. He's not an unemployed bartender, he *was* a bartender but is no longer looking for work in that field because he has a different job. I used to be a line cook, but now I have a different job. Am I an unemployed line cook?", "As someone currently getting a second degree in CompSci, I concur,", "He\u2019d also be eligible for unemployment if he got fired whereas with Uber he\u2019d be SOL.", "I mean...what does he WANT to do? Maybe encourage him to look at career planning, and get some of those career workbooks to figure out what would bring him joy? Not sure how affordable these are in your area but a career coaching company that does assessments with you, and looks at your credentials and aspirations and helps guide you in some selected areas.", "Most bar managers make less money than bartenders. \n\nIt sounds like you have an issue with telling people what your boyfriend does for a living because you have a college degree and he doesn't. That's not how you support your partner.", "Yeah, and nursing is the career I want to go into :)", "My wife is a therapist with a master's but I guess she's not legit because she's a contractor with no benefits...", "Depends on what you want out of life.  If you want to struggle until you die, always one accident or medical issue from homelessness, then ok. But if you want to have kids, own a home, and retire one day, it's unlikely with a gig economy job.", "He\u2019s NOT a cab driver.", "He\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck. They agreed to both develop their careers to contribute to their livelihood. He\u2019s not doing it.\n\nHow is *that* supposed to be supporting your partner? I would be embarrassed too.", "Also not delivering on the long term goals you shared isn't really being a good partner, either.\n\nIt would be different if they had never had any sort of conversations about advancing their careers. But communication like that at the beginning of a relationship defines not only long term expectations but also the sort of person you think you are dating.\n\nI don't see this as educational or income disparity. I see this as the boyfriend putting on some sort of front or facade in the honeymooning, but turning out to be a totally different person long term. And OP is totally entitled to decide she doesn't want to date the person Nate has revealed himself to be.", "I mean, he is essentially a cab driver. The difference between what he does and driving cab is down to compensation. That's it. He gets a request to pick someone up, picks them up, drops them off, gets paid for it. There are differences in how he's compensated, but that doesn't change the essential duties of his work, which is to drive a cab. You could argue that people who drive for a \"car service\" aren't \"taxi drivers\" too, but essentially it's all just cab driving.", "Cab drivers don\u2019t use their own cars and have more protection, benefits, possible unions. Same duties but it would be a step up and a more stable job.", ">Same duties but it would be a step up and a more stable job\n\nSure and a line cook at a fancy steak joint is a step up and more stable than a line cook on a taco truck but that doesn't mean that a line cook isn't a line cook. \n\nWho owns the car is a matter of compensation; he has to pay for repairs, so that comes out of what they pay him, and thus he earns less on the net than a cab driver, but that's still just a matter of payment. Benefits are compensation. Union vs. non union doesn't make it a different job, plenty of grocery store workers are not unionized but that doesn't mean they have a different job than those who are part of the union.\n\nedit: What other jobs can you think of that get a different name just because they have better compensation for the same work?", "Not sure what you\u2019re trying to prove here? I\u2019ve mentioned the ways one is better and they line up with her reasons for wanting him to have a better job which I\u2019d the whole point here.", "> Not sure what you\u2019re trying to prove here? \n\nI'm not sure how you're not sure? The person I originally responded to called him an unemployed bartender, and I'm trying to prove that his job is to drive a cab. How did you read my comments and not understand that?", "He\u2019s not a cab driver. He\u2019s a human delivery driver.", ">He\u2019s a human delivery driver.\n\nAs opposed to cab drivers who totally don't deliver humans to places by driving them? He's a poorly compensated cab driver, but his work is driving a cab. It may not have taxicab livery, but that's still what his job is."]}
