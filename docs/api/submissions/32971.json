It's very popular and thus very competitive. Especially since COVID lockdowns ended there have been a lot of layoffs at big companies like Microsoft and Spotify which effects the whole field. After all when you suddenly have 1,000+ people with a big name on their resume, and the skills to back it up it looking for jobs after being laid off everyone who doesn't have all that are going to struggle. Plus you have new grads with shiny new degrees joining the workforce every semester which looks way nicer than being self taught or a coding boot camp to many employers. \n\n\n\nBasically if he wants to get into tech he should be starting to learn sooner rather than later.

I have a friend who was in college and the person she was dating was working at a restaurant. She moved on and got her mba, while he was still working at the restaurant. She started her first career job and at Fortune 500 company, he was still at the restaurant. They got married, had kids, she moved on to another large brand company and he was still at the restaurant. They have been married over 15 years and only recently in 2020 did he lose his job because the restaurant had to close. He then used the next three years to not work and say he was needed to be home to help the kids through homeschooling during covid and only recently was handed a job at a catering company. He is 55 years old and will never change. What's hard about this is that she never fully accepted it and it's caused a lot of tension and fights in their marriage especially when she's working with people more successful and younger than him. Her bosses are younger than him! What you need to decide is if you're okay with the way things are now because he is 33 years old and this is it, you absolutely have to accept him for who he is and have to accept that this truly is it. Are you going to be happy with that? That is a question you need to ask yourself.", "NTA. It isn't a career. So isn't bartending.", "NTA - you delivered your concern kindly. I suspect he is lying to himself to get through the day.", "Dump that loser lmao", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, if he wants to work gig work like that for the rest of his life, there's no inherent shame in that. And you probably shouldn't have talked down about it on a mostly irrelevant point of it being something \"people do because they don\u2019t have other options\"; although he clearly does feel some shame if he's upset about it not being called a \"career\". \n\nHowever, instead of focusing on what you call what he does, you need to have a conversation about where your lives are going and what your financial expectations are for your future together. What is the end goal of a 5 year plan and what milestones and deadlines need to be met to get there in that time span and if he's willing to work towards them at the correct pace. \n\nSecondly, he's 33 and living in a fantasy land where he can just \"get into tech\" without a single qualification? Do you really buy that? Or do you think maybe he has no intention of ever doing that; it's just something he can say when pressed about his future goals that can somewhat be passed off as plausible. If he hasn't made any effort to work towards his own future, much less the future you imagine the two of you building, in the 4 years you've been together he needs to get a start on it now (there's literally no reason not to if his schedule is so flexible)... Or you need to stop letting him string you along.", "It all depends on how you communicated the information.  On the one hand it is reasonable for you to have these concerns.  On the other hand, he is well within his rights to make his own decisions about his own life.  Only after you are married or have kids are you really obligated to compromise and even then you can't truly force anyone too.\n\nSo, if you were 100% respectful in delivering your concerns, then NTA.  But if it turned into a big blow out fight then it's highly likely both of you acted like ass holes.  It takes two to tango.", "NTA. People are mentioning upwards mobility but it's more than that. It's the opportunity for growing skill sets, increasing income, and moving toward autonomy that define a career. Uber driving will do none of that for him. The job is thoroughly unskilled and inherently discourages development (since you literally cannot do anything else while driving). The pay is consistently low, will never reliably increase, and comes with terrible taxes and gas/maintenance costs. And you will never achieve autonomy working as a contractor for a heartless megacorp with so much unilateral leverage.\n\nIt's totally fine that he discovered Uber pays more and changed jobs (although I truly am dubious after costs and taxes, and think maybe the bartending gig could have evolved into a better paying establishment). But viewing this as a career and not a stepping stone is setting some painfully precarious standards of living. He should be using Uber to get to the next thing, not developing Stockholm Syndrome for it.\n\nPut another way: a self-employed career is when you manage contracts with different clients. If you only have one client, and *especially* when that client makes their money off exploiting employment law in exactly the way they are employing you, you are not in control of your \"career\". You are a bloodbag feeding a cancerous tumor, and no one should be romanticizing that in the way Nate is.\n\nI would have a serious talk with him, and if he can't see how problematic this is I would leave him.
