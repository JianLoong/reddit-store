You've acknowledged where she is in life and taken her feelings into account and then found a solution. This is not abandonment, it's fucking awesome, wholesome even...", "I'm not sure I understand your parents' point about you \"abandoning\" your daughter. What would they have you do? Not take the job in Korea and let a child dictate your husband's career trajectory? Or drag your daughter with you, kicking and screaming? \n\nIt's really tough for a child to move to a new school for their senior year. She'd be going off to university the year after next, anyway. It's not like you're putting her up in her own apartment; she'll be staying with her grandparents. \n\nIf it's what your daughter wants, and her grandparents are happy to take her in, I don't see the problem. NTA.", "NTA. At 16 she is old enough to have a say in her own life. She will be well taken care of (I assume) with your in-laws. This is not abandonment because you are providing for her. It sounds like a great solution, and honestly you sound like great parents for listening to her.", "I lived in Japan for a few years and worked in schools. Yes it's not exactly Korea, but the two countries have a lot of cultural and linguistic overlaps. NTA.\n\nYour daughter is right. She will not learn the language. Korean is one of the hardest languages for an English speaker to learn. At her age, it will probably take years before she can acquire the proficiency to have a meaningful interaction with somebody, and by that point, she probably would have left the country anyway to go to college elsewhere. Also, unless you are in a large city like Seoul, I'd be pretty surprised if you were able to find a school that provides both instruction in English and teaches Korean as a foreign language. Odds are she would have to just spend most of her time trying to learn Korean and not taking any other classes. She'd probably be incredibly lonely, bored and isolated from her classmates. Not to mention the culture shock; it can sometimes take years for people to truly adjust when moving to a place with a very different culture. And trust me, Korea is pretty different.\n\nThis is not to say that Korea is a terrible place to live. I would've loved to have the privilege to experience a foreign country as a teenager. But the timing is pretty terrible if she plans to go to college soon. She will not have enough time to become proficient in the language or fully adjust to the culture. I do think you have her best interests in mind here.\n\nETA - I wanna add that of course if the dad is being transferred somewhere like Seoul, then finding an international high school would not be an issue. But OP didn't specify, so I wanted to bring it up just in case. Regardless, it's important to understand that even in more globalized cities in East Asia like Seoul, it can still be difficult to navigate life as a foreigner there because there is so much \"novelty\" associated with your foreignness. It's exciting at first, and then becomes incredibly isolating. I'm not saying this is a reason to never move to East Asia, because there ARE ways to overcome it, but it's something that would be quite psychologically difficult for a 16YO to grapple with who doesn't speak the language and doesn't even want to be there to begin with.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter WANT to stay, and there will be people taking care of her. Then there's literally no problem. Your parents are just weird for seeing it as 'abandoning'. Why force her when there's already a solution for it?", "NTA You have responsible adults who are willing- and able- to watch over your daughter while your gone. She's going into what- her junior year? So it's a harder time in her education to move, both socially and academically.\n\nThat said- I'm make sure you have an agreement now about planned visits. Do you expect her to visit you? When? For how long?\n\nBecause if you expect her to come for her summer and winter vacations, which are reasonable- that's something that you need make clear up front. You agree it's reasonable that she finish high school with her friends but family time is still important and that time will be over her school breaks- and likely in Korea. Which means she won't be doing whatever her friends are doing at home. It's not a negotiation- it's information.\n\nI get your parents are going- you can't leave your kid behind. But she isn't 6 and it's different with people nearing the end of their high school academic career. Changing to a new school system at that point is really disruptive.", "When I was 17 and just three months from graduating high school in Arizona,  my mom (after divorcing my dad) decided to move back to California.  My older sister and brother had already graduated and were both over 18, so I was the only one that the move would effect.  I did not want to move and have to possibly graduate late or leave my boyfriend (now husband). My boyfriend and I sat down with my mother and proposed the idea that I stay in Arizona. We discussed options and she agreed.  I ended up staying with friends of the family until graduation and then moved into a house with my boyfriend,  his best friend and my brother (who also stayed in Arizona). It worked out wonderfully for all of us. I would have been miserable in California and that would have made my mom miserable. \n\nIf your daughter is okay with the arrangement,  that's all that matters. Your parents don't  get a say in this situation. She might miss you, but she was planning to move out at 18 anyway so she's just going to miss you a little earlier than planned.  But that's what email and phone calls are for. One suggestion,  though,  based on my situation. Draw up documents to make her grandparent's her legal guardian until she turns 18 so that if there's a medical emergency they can make decisions for her - my mom had  the family friends I was staying with be my legal guardian until graduation and then signed it over to my brother cause I was still a few months from being 18.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are the parents here, not your parents, not anyone else. If your daughter wants to stay and graduate with her friends and has family that would be delighted to have her living with them while she finishes up school, then what's the harm in that? She's 16, she's not a baby, she is plenty capable of knowing what she wants and making difficult decisions. What's the worst case scenario here? Genuinely asking, because as far as I can tell, worst case is she changes her mind, in which case you can fly her out and have her join you. \n\nLook at it this way, plenty of people send their much younger kids away to boarding school and no one calls that abandonment.", "Huh? How would you be an asshole for giving your daughter the choice? Many people even live on their own at 16, I don't see a problem. Also, I assume you would support her still and besides, planes will keep on flying between the two countries after the move as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Makes since for her to stay. My aunt and uncle had a military move to Germany. Oldest didn't want to go. They made sure she knew if she wanted too later, they'd get her a ticket. Worked out great never had to buy that ticket. In-laws have no say in the matter.", "NTA, a good parent will consider all the options.  Your not abandoning her.  Abandoning her, to me would be simply leaving her to fend for herself.  Your looking at other options such as her paternal grandparents.  There would be much to work out, but that can be done.  Thank you for considering your daughter's feelings in all of this.", "NTA. Moving across the globe to a country where you don't know anyone and don't speak the language is INCREDIBLY difficult for an adult, let alone a teenager who has at least 2 more years of school left. Forcing this move would almost certainly fuck up her education and chances of getting into a good university of that's her cirrent goal.", "NTA: 16-18 are when some of the most important memories are made in the young-adult stage. If she moves, she will miss prom, she will miss graduating with friends she\u2019s had since childhood, she will miss out on all of those memories she can make with her boyfriend in the months immediately following graduation before young adults go blaze their own trail for a few years before settling down. Uprooting her now would be doing her a legitimate disservice and may lead to long-term resentment/ damage to your relationship.", "NAH you are making a hard decision that would benefit your daughter. But definitely fly her to visit you and you visit her often", "NTA. Abandoning your daughter would be dumping her off on your in-laws, regardless of her feelings. This sounds like a solution that everyone but your parents can live with, which makes it a *them* problem. What a weird take on this situation for them to have.", "NTA. This is none of your parents business. Also idk what country you\u2019re in, but if it\u2019s the us and you\u2019re moving to Korea when she has one year of school left isn\u2019t good for her at all. She ain\u2019t going to learn a brand new language in one year. And like she said she\u2019s leaving when she\u2019s 18 anyways", "NTA. You aren't abandoning her. You're trying to do what's best for her.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll visit each other while apart. And with an open mind she may learn to love your new home \u2026 or not. Either way, she will still have the support structure that has developed over time.", "NTA. You have already found a responsible and logical solution to your problem.", "NTA\nShe will still be with family and taken care of.", "If she's OK with it, the in laws are ok with it and you are ok with it, then there's no problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA, everyone seems to be happy with this arrangement, your parents are the AH becuase they don't care what anyone else wants. You were going to take her with you, she didn't like that and even said she'd leave once she's 18. Instead of having her move and have miserable 14 months until she can move back you're allowing her to stay with her boyfriend. Boyfriend parents are also on board with this. You're not abandoning her you all made a decision together and that's what she prefers. You'll still be able to visit her.", "NTA. It's actually a good solution, and since she'll be 18 soon, I see the point of having her finish high school where she is.\n\nThat being said, I hope she finds the time to come stay with you guys for a bit. Living abroad is always a good opportunity to expand your cultural horizons and learn new perspectives on life.", "NTA.  Seems like a win, win.  I would, however, insist that she agree to an extended summer vacation with you in Korea so she can reconnect with the family.  I know she'll have to do without her BF for a while but you've worked with her on this situation and there is no reason she can't bend a little too.", "NTA\n\nMadam you are doing a big lot of things very good.

Dont let them controlling your life!", "WNBTA\n\nIt\u2019s a tough decision but it\u2019s sounds thoughtfully planned out. Everyone retains the right to change their minds.

It really sounds like you\u2019ve put a lot of thoughts into it and are trying to balance what is best for your daughter and the rest of your family. You\u2019re her parent. You love her more than anyone in the world ever will. I know it\u2019ll be hard to have her so far away, but you\u2019re willing to do that because you think it\u2019s best for her. You\u2019re leaving her in a safe, caring home.", "INFO: Where do your parents live? Are they close with your daughter?\n\nHonestly, I can't see a down side to her staying.", "NTA. It\u2019s a hard decision but one that has to be made. You\u2019ve recognized the difficulty she would be facing, accepting that going with you would not be the most beneficial thing for her, and have done your best to accommodate her whilst finding a solution that while not ideal, it is safe and works well. \nAs a parent it\u2019s really hard to accept that sometimes our older kids can\u2019t/won\u2019t come with us but you seem to have thought through it logically, although it is painful and upsetting.", "NTA\n\nYou are trying to make the best decision for your daughter and your family. You aren't abandoning your daughter by letting her live with your in-laws (happens every single day).", "NTA: you\u2019re honestly doing the best thing for your 16 year old. There\u2019s a reason that courts allow children at a certain age to pick who they want to live with after a divorce. Your parents are being ridiculous about this lol.", "NTA.  Living abroad could be a wonderful experience for your daughter.  At the same time, there are also good reasons for letting her stay and you have the means to do so.  I don\u2019t think either option would make you TA, especially if you go into either option with eyes open to the possibility that she will change her mind and want to move in one direction or the other later.", "NTA. It is very difficult to have to transfer schools in your final years of high school.  You are making a decision that is the best for your family. Her grandparents are able to have a close relationship with their granddaughter that most do not have. \nMy only suggestion is to have your daughter initially come to Korea with your initial move. She would be out of school and would have made her first flight with the family. She can stay a month and fly back home and still have some summer to get ready for the next school year. Please make sure if possible to have a room for her in your new home. \nGood luck with your move and the next chapter in your life.", "NTA she will be better off finishing high school in her current school. It\u2019s going to be very disruptive for her to have to get adjusted to a new school in Korea for her senior year. Who cares what your parents think. You are the parents. Their opinion doesn\u2019t matter. I went to college at 17, so 16 is really not that far off. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re abandoning her to live alone. She will be with her grandparents.", "NTA\n\nI don't think there is one right answer here. There are pros and cons to both the daughter staying in the States with extended family and with the daughter living in Korea with her family. \n\nI lived in Korea as a child (military parent) and it was a great experience. I also had to move to a new state and new high school for my senior year and that was rough. Making friends, breaking into established friend groups that had been around since kindergarten was not easy at all. \n\nI think if the daughter stays behind in the States, there needs to be discussion about when and how often she will be able to travel to Korea for holidays and such. There needs to be consensus on how the in-laws will \"parent\" their grandchild--what is allowed, what isn't, appropriate consequences.  Will there be a curfew? What happens if she is 10 minutes late? Two hours late? The appropriate paperwork needs to be done so the grandparents can take her to the ER if needed, etc. How often will she need to touch base with her parents? My niece went to college on a different continent than where her parents live, and she was required to text once a day to show she was okay. It could be a single emoji, but she needed to send that text. (I think that stopped after her sophomore year.) You will never think of everything, but ironing out the details for everything you can think of beforehand will be worth it.", "Nta. I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your daughter is almost an adult and I think it\u2019s good you\u2019re allowing her to make choices for herself and her life. I think this is great for your relationship. Just make sure you let her know that there is always a place for her to stay with you in Korea, if she misses you, and that her decision can be reversible.", "NAH. If you're happy to leave her and if your daughter is desperate to stay, then what's the problem? Your parents can moan all they want, but it's not like you've stuck her in an orphanage, she'll be living with family. Frankly it makes much more sense to leave her because then her education won't be disrupted.", "NTA. Part of you probably feels bad because you think that she will miss your support (and you will miss her, of course!), but it seems like she really wants to stay, and since your in-laws are willing to have her, that seems like the best solution for everyone included. Don't let your parents guilt trip you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are jelly.  Living with the \"other\" grandparents is a slight to them, even if daughter living with them wasn't even an option.  Your parents are jealous of the outcome.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to THINK she knows what she wants, and will more than likely be fine living with your in-laws (and maybe flying to Korea on holidays to visit you?). Odds are she will regret this later, but right now it seems as if you have a workable solution.", "NTA it\u2019s a solution that works both for your daughter and the rest of your immediate family. Idk why your parents would have a problem with that.", "NTA do what's best for your daughters mental health and well-being.", "NTA. You are not abandoning her. She is living with her grandparents. Completely acceptable. Make sure they have everything in place as her guardians for medical emergency or school authorization, etc.", "NTA!!\nI went to 4 different high schools. It was fucking horrible. To yank her out of her life when she\u2019s so close to graduating would be cruel especially if you had the option of letting her stay with grandparents.", "Nta she's 16.  If this was a custody case the judge would let her decide.  Can she stay here during the school year and then come visit the while summer?", "NTA\n\nYou are putting your daughters feelings first and ensuring she has a safe and supportive place to live with family.  \n\nToo often people will drag their kids along when they move and end up driving a wedge between them because of the pain it causes.  You aren't doing this and are probably further strengthening what seems to be an already good relationship you have with her.", "NTA-sounds like this is what she wants to do and sounds like inlaw are ok with it.", "NTA! Amazing to finally see a parent on here that is putting their kids feelings FIRST during a move and being willing to compromise and do what\u2019s best for her instead of what\u2019s best for you and making her deal with it. Your daughter is so lucky to have such understanding and thoughtful parents.", "NTA. Distance does not mean anything with cell phones, FaceTime, and internet access, so you will still be a very active part of your daughter\u2019s life.

It started to make impacts on high school because we moved to a new state each time.  We finally moved to the state I am in how during junior year of high school.  By the end of that year, my dad was not sure he had a job still and was planning to move.  To another state.  Each move to a new state created a delimma for me--I had to play catch up on required courses for graduation and in some cases had to wait to the next year to get the class but we moved.  This time I was ready to beg and plead if I had to to stay because my aunt and grandparents lived in the area where we did and the school district.  I wanted to stay to make sure that I finished senior year at this school and not have to try playing catch up in a new state.  Lucky for my dad, he kept his job.  I am pretty sure my parents would have allowed it taking into consideration that I would have been maybe an extra year playing catch up on requirements if we moves again.  This way your daughter can continue her education and not have to make up classes that she may have missed for graduation requirements in Korea.  She also can continue her activities, be with her friends, etc.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s about time to talk to your daughter about what she wants and the realities that come with this.\n\nWhile In laws are willing to help host her.

I had friends, and I didn't want to up and leave like I did when I left Hawaii. So my dad asked my aunt if I could stay with her and I did. I lived with her until I moved out and got my own place with my bf at 19. My dad visited every year of course so it's not like I felt abandoned or anything. It was my choice.

Staying back with friends or relatives is a practical solution that works for everyone.", "NTA. I wish more parents were this understanding, trusting and accommodating of their kids, my own included. You\u2019re allowing her to have a say in her own life at an age where she\u2019s starting to be her own person.

I would, however, make sure that your daughter agrees to visit you for things like spring break and over the holidays. But this is the sort of thing that is going to go a long way towards making her feel like she is understood and is an independent person whose feelings are validated.\n\nIs this job posting temporary? If so, the other option would be for your husband to go solo and come back to visit as often as he can, but if there's no end date in store, then that might be harder to work out.", "Forcing your daughter to leave right before her senior year and taking her away from all of her family and friends to a foreign country would make you the asshole.

I think it would be very good for you to assure your daughter that even if she stays you do want her to visit you and her to come visit as well.

I had panic attacks the whole year, was suicidal for a while, and was generally awful to my whole family. I was so miserable.\n\nIf you can give her the option to not go through what I went through, please do.

And have a viable option for her to stay", "NTA. You're not abandoning her, she wants this. Aren't they happy she'll be staying closer? I had a friend in primary school whose family happened to move to a rural town around the same time my family did. His family came, he stayed with other relatives because the town didn't have many opportunities for his extracurriculars. It worked out for him last I heard.\n\nI hated moving at first, I had lost all my friends and it took me a year to stop telling constant stories about 'when I still lived in x...'. Thing is, it was only a three hour drive away from my old home. I could still visit people if I wanted to when we returned to see family. I could make new friends because I spoke the same language and expected to stay for the next several years (plus my previous friendships were mostly limited to school hours anyway). Your daughter doesn't have any of that. Visiting from another country is much harder. Making friends is harder with a language barrier. Even if she becomes fluent overnight, a year or so isn't much time to bond with people and she'll wait it out in misery before running back to the life she's known for so much longer. She has a committed boyfriend she can't casually abandon or replace. She'll obviously miss you when you're gone, but it will hurt less than missing everyone else while feeling so isolated and having no support system other than parents who forced her into this new unwanted lifestyle. \n\nI think giving her this offer shows you're paying attention to her feelings and treating her like an individual person and not your property to be packed up and shipped away when you feel like it. She will appreciate you for it and not grow resentful. It's different for the younger kids, they're more dependent on you and probably don't have as many strong ties to your current home. They have plenty of time to adjust and make new friends, your daughter doesn't without leaving lots of things behind.", "NTA.

I had a hard time acclimating and I already knew the language quite well. Making friends is hard, giving up old friends is even harder and I wasn't even that social as a kid; your daughter seems very deeply connected to her friends, it will be infinitely harder on her.\n\nShe has a place to stay with family who cares for her.

If this is the case, then this is a gentle YTA situation because this could be easily framed as an opportunity for your daughter to experience a new culture, make new friends, have a new adventure, etc. while keeping your family together.

You should be aware that if she doesn\u2019t go, she will be more isolated from your family\u2019s shared history/story-making and it is inevitable that she will be left out of a lot of exciting experiences and memories\u2026the kinds of experiences that will be sure to create a unique closeness between the family members who do go.", "NTA you aren\u2019t leaving her for your convenience but for her own mental well being.

I came out by myself in February 2022 and lived alone, at first. It was so hard for me but my kids were thriving at home with their dad so I sucked it up and plowed through.

We all met in Los Angeles for Xmas and my husband dropped everything and flew to NY in January when I had to have emergency surgery. It's been hard to live apart from my older teen. We text a lot and occasionally talk on the phone. I send a lot of funny pix and posts I see on social media just so we can stay connected.

Good on you for coming up with a great compromise to a difficult situation.\n\nIf your daughter plans on going to college, if she moves with you and graduates from a foreign HS and has expat parents, she likely won\u2019t qualify for any sort of financial aid. That\u2019s what happened to my partner when his family moved to Asia for his HS years and he came back for college. Unless you are able to pay for her college in full, having her stay in the US will make applying for and being accepted by colleges a much different experience. Maybe that will help your parents get off your back, unless they can foot the bill entirely for her college education.", "NTA as long as you make sure you keep strong ties between your selves and your younger kids and their sister/your daughter.\n\nRemember you'll be thousands of miles away so you'll have to foster that relationship very intently or else you run a real risk of her...\"just kinda stopped keeping in touch over the years....\"", "NTA. It is kind of you to consider your daughter as an individual and to respect her wishes.

Have her stay a week or two and then go back home to her life with her grandparents. That way, she'll be a part of both of your family's lives, and still feel connected to your experience. That flight home will be her transition into a new phase of her life, knowing that you're all okay.\n\nYour parents might be worried that won't get to see her anymore. That is valid.

You are doing the right thing and respecting her wishes. Don't listen to your parents.\n\nJust let her know she's always welcome to come if she wants to.", "NTA- worry less about your parent's shitty opinions, you can't really abandon someone who doesn't wish to accompany you in the first place, there's no need for upheaval on either end and you've found a wonderful solution that makes everyone happy for now. Your daughter is a young woman and developmentally this sounds really healthy as long as she has a safe and secure place to live.", "NTA. You're not leaving her alone to fend for herself, you're leaving her with family. You're doing the right thing for her.", "NTA!!! She is at such a pivotal age, and to rip her from everything, especially this far into her education, would be a total disservice. \n\nJust make sure that if you go thru with moving without her, that you include her as much as you can.

Make sure she knows she is still very much a part of your family.", "NTA, this is beautiful, you guys actually are listening to the needs of your daughter and treating her with understanding and compassion. You two seem like excellent parents and i think it's the right thing to do as long as she's taken care of :)", "NTA. You don't have just the two choices you describe to take your daughter to Korea or leave her while you go. You also have a third choice of not taking the job because it is bad for your children. None of these are great choices for everyone, but don't pretend there are only two options. NTA because there are no good options. Moving to another country without knowing the language at age 16 would be horrible for many children. You could give her the choice of moving or staying with her grandparents so that she feels she has some say in what is happening to her family. Your relationship with her will be affected as you will miss 2 years with her. Still NTA.", "YWNBTA and I would say you WBTA if you did take her. Your other kids may not even remember the change but she will and it will affect her greatly.

I wouldn't be saying this if I thought she was going to move into boyfriend's house at such a young age.\n\nLetting her finish high school with her class is a gift.  Is she considering college?  \n\nOne concern is being dependent on her boyfriend at such a young age.  Just because they've been together so long, doesn't mean he's the right match for her going into her 20's.  I hope she's considering getting out of your small town for more education.", "NTA. It doesn't meet the definition of abandonment. What about kids that go to boarding schools? At the end of the day,  you know in your heart what's best for your daughter. \n\nI'm sure your parents mean well, but to assume you're abandoning your daughter was rather  dramatic. I went to high school with a few kids who lived with relatives for their last year or 2, and they turned out fine. What's the big deal?", "NTA.  Things come up in life and sometimes what is ideal (everybody under one roof) is not what is actually best.  To your credit, you are not treating your children as a single entity and are looking at what your oldest needs individually. \n\nThis sounds like it\u2019s for the best.  She doesn\u2019t want to go and her reasoning is not invalid - even if you put her in an American school, her social life will still be difficult.  This way, she gets to finish our high school and continue her education and social relationships, all while being looked after by family - the opposite of abandoned.  Plus, your relationship with her is guaranteed to suffer if you took her to Korea - so this way, you can have visits and maintain that bond, even if at a distance (technology is a boon for this). And it probably will help the relationship that she knows you trust her and respect her enough to listen to her. And if you keep up with her life directly and with your ILs, you\u2019ll be able to know what\u2019s happening in her life.  \n\nI do think some rules are good here - daily communication, house rules  etc.  But it sounds like she is a pretty good kid, so this can work very well.", "NTA  - Sounds like a win win. Just make sure that you lay down the groundwork. To her she needs to respect and listen to her grandparents. To the grandparents, no hiding and misbehaving. You, as the parents can decide if the grandparent handled any situation in an appropriate manner. \n\nIt's a shame that your daughter will miss out on such a wonderful opportunity, something she may regret in the future.", "Kids don't live with there parent all the time for various reasons. Take boarding school, for instance. I know this isn't the same issue, but if it's what your daughter wants then go for it. You aren't abandoning her, you're *respecting* her. Besides, it's not like she can't change her mind of visit and we now live in a world of video chat so you can \"face to face\" as often as you want.\n\nNTA", "I think you've made a very difficult but very child centred decision OP, nta at all. It's not like you've thrown her out on the streets. Make it a condition that she has to visit  and get the arrangements with the ILs in writing.

To accuse you of abandonment in this scenario is just obscene and offensive.

I think it would be very difficult and traumatic for a 16 year old girl to be taken to a new country with a very different language and culture if 1) there are workable alternatives, and 2) if she does not want to go.  If her grandparents (your in-laws) are happy to have her and she is happy to stay with them to finish out high school, this would be an immense kindness.  \n\nRegular Zoom calls and (if affordable) visits will keep you connected.  Your parents should mind their own business.", "NTA.\n\nMoving to a new country with a new language to learn at almost 17 is a HUGE ask. I know I wouldn't have been able to handle that kind of enormous change when I was 16. I think having to learn the new language is the biggest/scariest part of it for me. I would feel isolated and alone surrounded by people I couldn't even have a conversation with.\n\nThose grandparents sound like old fuddy-duddy stick-in-the-muds who just aren't happy because \"That's not how we did it in OUR day!\" at least thats the impression I get.\n\nEspecially having to do your last year or two of highschool in another country, with probably different schedules and academic methods than she has learned... man, yeah, that's a big change for someone at that age. If she was like, 8, then yeah you'd take her with you no question, but 16.... That's a tough one.", "NTA. \n\nIt's better for everyone this way. You're not \"abandoning\" your daughter, you're respecting that she's old enough and mature enough to make her own decision on this, even if it doesn't align with what you want. Besides, it's not like you're leaving her with the house and saying \"Good luck!\" You're leaving her with her grandparents, whom both you and her trust.

My folks let my brother stay when we moved half a continent away and he was able to finish his grade school years with the friends he had known his whole life and he was incredibly thankful for that. He did end up moving years later to be near us when the time was right (our mother got sick). It just didn't have to be his senior year.", "NTA- please do not make your daughter move. It will only cause her misery and her to hate you. She\u2019ll be off at college in a year anyway, better to start the transition to adulthood with her loving grandparents in a town she knows and loves. She\u2019ll probably even be excited to visit you in Korea over holidays instead of hating you.", "As a person who had to move across the country (and not even OUT of country!) between 9th and 10th grades, NTA. These moves are MUCH harder on well-adjusted teenagers than older folks really ever got. I don't think I ever quite recovered from the move emotionally. Logically it took me about 5 years to move on and then only because I found my feet again a bit into college, and I missed out on a LOT due to that lack of connections and emotional maturity in that time that I regret to this day. I absolutely believe what she told you would happen if you made/make her move with you to Korea.   \n\n\nI believe you are making the right decision.

She'll be with her grandparents and this is what she has expressed that she wants. I'd just make sure to keep the communication lines open to her so she knows she can come over later, or at least can always contact you, in order to limit the risk of abandonment feelings later in case things go south with the boyfriend and she wants her parents.", "I understand that this works for everyone, but is your husbands job offer really worth uprooting your family and being separated from your child? If that\u2019s something you guys and your daughter are happy with then I don\u2019t think you need much advice from here. \n\nMy brother let my nephew move to Qatar, then covid hit and we didn\u2019t see him for years, we barely do now and I\u2019m still very bitter about it as he was like my second child. Be prepared and remember that life has many unexpected twists and turns. The last few years alone should have opened all of our eyes to how quickly things can change..", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t want to go and she will be staying with family, not by herself. \n\nSame thing happened when my mom and stepdad wanted to move to another state. She game me and brother a choice. I went with them and my brother stayed with our dad. Don\u2019t need to say people were calling her a bad mother, that she was abandoning her son.

The rest is just the rest.", "I was in this position, or close to it, when I was 13. My parents wanted to move to Australia. I had just settled into school and figured out friends. They forced me to move, and it remains one of the most singularly traumatising experiences of my life, even past the murder of a close friend at 17.\n\nYou're making the right decision to let her pick. Korea is a very different culture and language, and her schooling would be interrupted quite badly.

Your parents are wrong.", "NTA!\n\nIt sounds like a great solution for your whole family.\n\nI live in Korea, and the language IS very difficult to master. I\u2019ve been studying for over a decade and still have lots of awkward, embarrassing misunderstandings. \n\nThere would be other issues to deal with, too, at that age. The average Korean sixteen year old is studying at LEAST twelve hours a day in order to pass the Suneung, which is the Korean version of the SAT. It is notoriously difficult and complicated even for Koreans. I doubt your daughter would have to take it, but that means nobody has time to hang out, and it would be nearly impossible to make friends with Korean students.\n\nAlso, the Korean school year starts in March, not September, which means your daughter would graduate six months after everyone else she knows. That also messes with starting university. \n\nYou could avoid all this by sending your daughter to international school, but it\u2019s about $30,000/year, so you might have to budget carefully.", "NTA she can visit you guys on holidays and in the summer.", "You\u2019re not abandoning her.

Not everyone is good at languages. She will have next to nothing in common with Korean kids.

Probably OP's parents are deeply unhappy about the move to Korea, and are stirring up trouble where they can.", "I had more than one friend senior year who was left behind with friends or relatives because their parents had to move home. I live near DC and we had a lot of kids whose parents were Bush appointees that had to go back to home states once Obama took office but didn\u2019t want to uproot their kids from really good schools their senior year.", "I think this would be a different story if their child was not 14 months away from being 18. They\u2019re treating their 16-year-old daughter like an adult, and are accommodating her wants and needs of staying there while not missing out on a HUGE opportunity for husband. I think this is parenting at its finest \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "No, there are not international schools conducting high school classes in English in every city in East Asia. It depends where you are located. Yes, I'm sure if they move to globalized city like Seoul they could find an international school, which is why I said \"unless you are in a large city.\" OP didn't specify where in Korea they're moving or if they had secured an international high school in this scenario, which is why I brought that point up.", "International school is crazy expensive in Korea, though! The little kids can go to Korean-language daycare or kindergarten, which are both very reasonably priced.", ">You are 100% wrong that will take years to have a meaningful conversation.\n\nI meant in Korean.", "I mean as other people have said it would be absolutely crazy to put her in a Korean speaking high school. Have you not looked into international schools that teach in English? Even for the younger ones it\u2019s probably something to consider. Do you and your husband speak Korean? Or are you both going to be learning from scratch as well?", "It's as if you've done no research. South Korea has international schools so why would she need to skip a year? Is your husband skipping a year learning the language before working there? YTA.", "I am very sympathetic to her position, and I myself would have been devastated to miss my senior year with my friends. High school wasn't amazing, but I did have great friends and I would want to finish the experience with them.\n\nThat said, that boyfriend will (likely) not last. Those friends will probably go to different colleges/universities, maybe move to new cities, etc. Life moves on. The opportunity to live in a new country and totally immerse yourself in a new experience is rare, especially before responsibilities like paying rent/mortgage/retirement/healthcare etc. Perhaps when she is 25 or 30 and in the grind she may think \"damn, would have been cool to do that.\" Or not! Who knows.\n\nI think OP is right to let her kid decide this for herself and if it were earlier into high school I would say to just drag her along. But I get why some people may feel she could regret this one day.", "The experience of living in a different culture is invaluable. It's a bit difficult to understand for those who have never done it, and also difficult to explain. Forcing her to do it would be wrong but it is pretty likely that she will regret her decision in the future.", "How is it awful, she is missing out on a amazing experience by already saying she would have a horrible time and refuse to do anything to make it better and then leave as soon as possible. It's ok the parents will let her stay, it's just sad refusing to try anything new.", "Great point about her parents feeling bad for in-laws taking in their daughter. Surely they can visit.", "Agreed. It may be driven by jealousy and fear that they may not have access to the child while she is with her other grandparents. They may also be trying to intimidate OP into staying behind. Either way, it's controlling behavior.  OP needs to consider what the relationship is between the Grands. Would her parents prefer to have zero access because the daughter is in Korea or access through the other grandparents? \n\nOP needs to focus on what is best for the family, especially their daughter. Other people's agendas need not be considered.", "I think they're actually trying to get OP and husband not to move. Or they're jealous that they weren't asked to watch daughter and she's going to her other grandparents instead.", "To be fair, moving a teen this late into their high school years could really affect their college prospects.  I'd also be leaving my kid behind.", "[deleted]", "Normally, the parent's company will pay for the school.", "My family emigrated when I was 16 to a country with a different language, different customs, school totally different, etc. And it was so damn hard. Leaving my social group behind. Learning the language. \n\nMy period even stopped for like 6 months from the stress.", "This makes a lot of sense. Good point.", "She's 16. At 16 I was the one going to another continent half a world away for the best part of a year, with a language I barely knew and no friends or family. She's staying home in the town she's known her entire life with her friend circle, boyfriend, and grandparents. She'll be fine. \n\nWe really need to stop infantilising women. Not saying that's what you're doing necessarily, but there's definitely a shitty double standard out there.", "> she's only 16.\n\nAlmost 17. Which means only one year of high school left, and no one would bat at eye at her moving away at that point. This is just a softer transition.", "I suppose we've just had different experiences. I lived in a Japanese city that did NOT have international schools. I witnessed students from foreign countries come to the schools becoming incredibly isolated and unable to participate in many activities. I'd rather not go into too much detail, but the school was completely unprepared to deal with foreign students in my opinion, and as a result their education and social experiences suffered greatly. Of course, if OP is transferring to Seoul then this will likely not be an issue. But again....they didn't specify. Which is why I brought it up just in case.", "There are American schools that expat kids attend.  Guess what,  we have prom, sports, and graduation with caps and gowns.  The academics are more advanced than most public schools, which looks better on college applications. \n\nAlso, with all the technology available there is no reason she can't keep in contact with her friends.   If her relationship with her boyfriend is true, it can withstand a year apart.  What about all the new friends she can make, all the new experiences she can have?", "I have no issue with small towns, if that's what you chose. I'm pointing out if it's ALL you know, and you have this kind of opportunity, it's ridiculous to miss out on it, given she will have her parents and plenty of support to ensure her education is kept on track. I mean there are American or International or English schools in Korea. (My friend did this for a few years in early high school and did not learn much Korean.) She probably has BETTER college options for having the experience.", "It\u2019s likely she\u2019d attend an international school in Korea, so it probably won\u2019t be that different. That said, my parents moved us to a new city when I was about that age and that was hard enough. If she wants to stay, and her grandparents want to have her, she should stay.", "This is so valid. Also, as someone with familiarity living in South Korea and culturally similar countries, it can be a big culture shock to a teenager used to North American or Western European culture (as it sounds like that\u2019s where OP might be from). \n\nIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s worse or anything, it is just very different, and Korean can be very difficult for someone who only speaks English or other European languages. It will be much easier for the younger kids who will just soak it all up.\n\nIn this case, since the daughter knows what she wants and is old enough for OP to know this isn\u2019t just some arbitrary tantrum, she\u2019s doing the mature thing to make sure her daughter can stay happy. So NTA at all.\n\nSouth Korea is an amazing place to visit though, and I\u2019m sure the daughter will enjoy spending time with her family there during the holidays. She can even bring her boyfriend if she wants and they\u2019d have a great time.", "Yep, I turned 18 literally the day before I moved into my dorm room for freshman year, and one of my roommates this year didn\u2019t turn 18 until a couple weeks in. Both of my parents went off to college at 17 and didn\u2019t turn 18 until the end of October. Granted, that was the 80s and the cutoff dates for when you could be enrolled in school as a kid were very different, but still.", "Since it's her father's company moving them I would imagine they would be living somewhere like Seoul or Busan, but your points still stand.\n\n>\tstudents from foreign countries come to the schools becoming incredibly isolated and unable to participate in many activities...the school was completely unprepared to deal with foreign students in my opinion, and as a result their education and social experiences suffered greatly.\n\nAlso, not to say that it's a sure thing, but bullying is a huge systemic issue in the Korean educational system. Many kinds of differences can make you a target. The novelty of having an American classmate could insulate her some, but even then there's plenty of unintentional factors that would isolate her like you've talked about.", "Korea is such a hard language to learn. She\u2019ll barely be able to have a proper conversation with those hypothetical new friends. She doesn\u2019t want new friends or new experiences at this point in her life. She has a right to that decision.", "I loved in Seoul, and quite a few people speak English.  She would not have to learn the language right away.", "As far as family, the only person not going with them is their daughter, who is going to be 18 soon anyways, an age when many people stop living with their parents. As far as leaving their life behind, their life will now be in Korea, they're not leaving it behind, they're moving it.", "Yeah the culture shock can be so massive! I moved to South America from an english speaking country, and the differences were so massive. I can't even imagine moving to South Korea!", "Exactly, I wish I could upvote this more than once! There\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been friends with for over 10 years now and we\u2019re still really close, and I\u2019m even grabbing lunch with her later today. Not all teen friendships last forever, but there are plenty that do. I missed out on prom and a lot of my senior year because of Covid and all the restrictions even when we did go back, I\u2019d feel even worse for this kid if she missed all that because she had to move overseas while all her friends still get to experience all that. There are people from high school and my teenage years that I\u2019m not friends with anymore, but I can still look back and look at all the fond memories I have of them. I\u2019m glad you can appreciate the value of these friends and memories even though they may not last :)", ">I probably would for e my kids to go with me even though the experience would be difficult as I view international experiences to be incredibly formative and important....\n\nInternational experiences are not something that should be forced at this age. A vacation is one thing but an entire life relocation is just selfish. Teenagers on the verge of adulthood have enough problems in this world to worry about without their parents expecting them to start all over in a place far away from their support circles.", "That\u2019s true but they\u2019re mostly in the Northwest and the South. Depending on their location she may not have access to international school unless it\u2019s a boarding school. Even if she did, I don\u2019t see the point in moving to Korea and most likely moving back to the U.S. anyway.", "Yeah, but what\u2019s the point of taking time to learn the language when she\u2019s most likely going to go back to the U.S. anyway?", "mothers, fathers, friends, extended family is still family.", "Not very experienced in critical thinking skills it seems if you just expect your kids to do whatever the hell you want and they just have to deal with it without any consideration from you. \n\nThere is no benefit to the 16 year old (and shes on the edge of 17) moving to Korea at this point in her life. At this stage of her life she should be learning about the basics of adulting. Taxes, building credit, building a resume etc. All of which are difficult for kids who speak their native language to learn. Adding in forcing her to attempt to learn one of the most difficult languages for English speakers, and you're just forcing a massive stress on her that she doesn't need. And for what? If she has a place to live then there really is no issue.", "Most people don\u2019t live in the same town as their parents or extended family, I certainly don\u2019t. My best friend lives in a different part of the country as well. I understand that may not be for everyone, but to be fundamentally against that for everyone is a bit much.", "No one said happier. But people regret all sorts of things in life. And the opportunity to be immersed in another culture like this is certainly an opportunity someone may regret one day. Even if it is the most sensible choice", "> At this stage of her life she should be learning about the basics of adulting. Taxes, building credit, building a resume etc.\n\nwhere in the US are 16 year olds learning that lol", "I never said that. I never said what she should or shouldn't do only answered a question. You too lack critical reading skills."]}
