You've acknowledged where she is in life and taken her feelings into account and then found a solution. This is not abandonment, it's fucking awesome, wholesome even...", "I'm not sure I understand your parents' point about you \"abandoning\" your daughter. What would they have you do? Not take the job in Korea and let a child dictate your husband's career trajectory? Or drag your daughter with you, kicking and screaming? \n\nIt's really tough for a child to move to a new school for their senior year. She'd be going off to university the year after next, anyway. It's not like you're putting her up in her own apartment; she'll be staying with her grandparents. \n\nIf it's what your daughter wants, and her grandparents are happy to take her in, I don't see the problem. NTA.", "NTA. At 16 she is old enough to have a say in her own life. She will be well taken care of (I assume) with your in-laws. This is not abandonment because you are providing for her. It sounds like a great solution, and honestly you sound like great parents for listening to her.", "I lived in Japan for a few years and worked in schools. Yes it's not exactly Korea, but the two countries have a lot of cultural and linguistic overlaps. NTA.\n\nYour daughter is right. She will not learn the language. Korean is one of the hardest languages for an English speaker to learn. At her age, it will probably take years before she can acquire the proficiency to have a meaningful interaction with somebody, and by that point, she probably would have left the country anyway to go to college elsewhere. Also, unless you are in a large city like Seoul, I'd be pretty surprised if you were able to find a school that provides both instruction in English and teaches Korean as a foreign language. Odds are she would have to just spend most of her time trying to learn Korean and not taking any other classes. She'd probably be incredibly lonely, bored and isolated from her classmates. Not to mention the culture shock; it can sometimes take years for people to truly adjust when moving to a place with a very different culture. And trust me, Korea is pretty different.\n\nThis is not to say that Korea is a terrible place to live. I would've loved to have the privilege to experience a foreign country as a teenager. But the timing is pretty terrible if she plans to go to college soon. She will not have enough time to become proficient in the language or fully adjust to the culture. I do think you have her best interests in mind here.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter WANT to stay, and there will be people taking care of her. Then there's literally no problem. Your parents are just weird for seeing it as 'abandoning'. Why force her when there's already a solution for it?", "NTA You have responsible adults who are willing- and able- to watch over your daughter while your gone. She's going into what- her junior year? So it's a harder time in her education to move, both socially and academically.\n\nThat said- I'm make sure you have an agreement now about planned visits. Do you expect her to visit you? When? For how long?\n\nBecause if you expect her to come for her summer and winter vacations, which are reasonable- that's something that you need make clear up front. You agree it's reasonable that she finish high school with her friends but family time is still important and that time will be over her school breaks- and likely in Korea. Which means she won't be doing whatever her friends are doing at home. It's not a negotiation- it's information.\n\nI get your parents are going- you can't leave your kid behind. But she isn't 6 and it's different with people nearing the end of their high school academic career. Changing to a new school system at that point is really disruptive.", "When I was 17 and just three months from graduating high school in Arizona,  my mom (after divorcing my dad) decided to move back to California.  My older sister and brother had already graduated and were both over 18, so I was the only one that the move would effect.  I did not want to move and have to possibly graduate late or leave my boyfriend (now husband). My boyfriend and I sat down with my mother and proposed the idea that I stay in Arizona. We discussed options and she agreed.  I ended up staying with friends of the family until graduation and then moved into a house with my boyfriend,  his best friend and my brother (who also stayed in Arizona). It worked out wonderfully for all of us. I would have been miserable in California and that would have made my mom miserable. \n\nIf your daughter is okay with the arrangement,  that's all that matters. Your parents don't  get a say in this situation. She might miss you, but she was planning to move out at 18 anyway so she's just going to miss you a little earlier than planned.  But that's what email and phone calls are for. One suggestion,  though,  based on my situation. Draw up documents to make her grandparent's her legal guardian until she turns 18 so that if there's a medical emergency they can make decisions for her - my mom had  the family friends I was staying with be my legal guardian until graduation and then signed it over to my brother cause I was still a few months from being 18.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are the parents here, not your parents, not anyone else. If your daughter wants to stay and graduate with her friends and has family that would be delighted to have her living with them while she finishes up school, then what's the harm in that? She's 16, she's not a baby, she is plenty capable of knowing what she wants and making difficult decisions. What's the worst case scenario here? Genuinely asking, because as far as I can tell, worst case is she changes her mind, in which case you can fly her out and have her join you. \n\nLook at it this way, plenty of people send their much younger kids away to boarding school and no one calls that abandonment.", "Huh? How would you be an asshole for giving your daughter the choice? Many people even live on their own at 16, I don't see a problem. Also, I assume you would support her still and besides, planes will keep on flying between the two countries after the move as well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Makes since for her to stay. My aunt and uncle had a military move to Germany. Oldest didn't want to go. They made sure she knew if she wanted too later, they'd get her a ticket. Worked out great never had to buy that ticket. In-laws have no say in the matter.", "NTA, a good parent will consider all the options.  Your not abandoning her.  Abandoning her, to me would be simply leaving her to fend for herself.  Your looking at other options such as her paternal grandparents.  There would be much to work out, but that can be done.  Thank you for considering your daughter's feelings in all of this.", "NTA. Moving across the globe to a country where you don't know anyone and don't speak the language is INCREDIBLY difficult for an adult, let alone a teenager who has at least 2 more years of school left. Forcing this move would almost certainly fuck up her education and chances of getting into a good university of that's her cirrent goal.", "NTA: 16-18 are when some of the most important memories are made in the young-adult stage. If she moves, she will miss prom, she will miss graduating with friends she\u2019s had since childhood, she will miss out on all of those memories she can make with her boyfriend in the months immediately following graduation before young adults go blaze their own trail for a few years before settling down. Uprooting her now would be doing her a legitimate disservice and may lead to long-term resentment/ damage to your relationship.", "NAH you are making a hard decision that would benefit your daughter. But definitely fly her to visit you and you visit her often", "NTA. Abandoning your daughter would be dumping her off on your in-laws, regardless of her feelings. This sounds like a solution that everyone but your parents can live with, which makes it a *them* problem. What a weird take on this situation for them to have.", "NTA. This is none of your parents business. Also idk what country you\u2019re in, but if it\u2019s the us and you\u2019re moving to Korea when she has one year of school left isn\u2019t good for her at all. She ain\u2019t going to learn a brand new language in one year. And like she said she\u2019s leaving when she\u2019s 18 anyways", "NTA. You aren't abandoning her. You're trying to do what's best for her.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll visit each other while apart. And with an open mind she may learn to love your new home \u2026 or not. Either way, she will still have the support structure that has developed over time.", "NTA. You have already found a responsible and logical solution to your problem.", "NTA\nShe will still be with family and taken care of.", "If she's OK with it, the in laws are ok with it and you are ok with it, then there's no problem.\n\nNTA", "NTA, everyone seems to be happy with this arrangement, your parents are the AH becuase they don't care what anyone else wants. You were going to take her with you, she didn't like that and even said she'd leave once she's 18. Instead of having her move and have miserable 14 months until she can move back you're allowing her to stay with her boyfriend. Boyfriend parents are also on board with this. You're not abandoning her you all made a decision together and that's what she prefers. You'll still be able to visit her.", "NTA. It's actually a good solution, and since she'll be 18 soon, I see the point of having her finish high school where she is.\n\nThat being said, I hope she finds the time to come stay with you guys for a bit. Living abroad is always a good opportunity to expand your cultural horizons and learn new perspectives on life.", "NTA.  Seems like a win, win.  I would, however, insist that she agree to an extended summer vacation with you in Korea so she can reconnect with the family.  I know she'll have to do without her BF for a while but you've worked with her on this situation and there is no reason she can't bend a little too.", "NTA\n\nMadam you are doing a big lot of things very good. You are searching for a solution for your daugther, thank you very much.\n\nYour parents are wrong. Dont let them controlling your life!", "WNBTA\n\nIt\u2019s a tough decision but it\u2019s sounds thoughtfully planned out. Everyone retains the right to change their minds. If it doesn\u2019t work it sounds like you will all do your best to resolve the problems.", "NTA. It really sounds like you\u2019ve put a lot of thoughts into it and are trying to balance what is best for your daughter and the rest of your family. You\u2019re her parent. You love her more than anyone in the world ever will. I know it\u2019ll be hard to have her so far away, but you\u2019re willing to do that because you think it\u2019s best for her. You\u2019re leaving her in a safe, caring home.", "INFO: Where do your parents live? Are they close with your daughter?\n\nHonestly, I can't see a down side to her staying.", "NTA. It\u2019s a hard decision but one that has to be made. You\u2019ve recognized the difficulty she would be facing, accepting that going with you would not be the most beneficial thing for her, and have done your best to accommodate her whilst finding a solution that while not ideal, it is safe and works well. \nAs a parent it\u2019s really hard to accept that sometimes our older kids can\u2019t/won\u2019t come with us but you seem to have thought through it logically, although it is painful and upsetting.", "NTA\n\nYou are trying to make the best decision for your daughter and your family. You aren't abandoning your daughter by letting her live with your in-laws (happens every single day).", "NTA: you\u2019re honestly doing the best thing for your 16 year old. There\u2019s a reason that courts allow children at a certain age to pick who they want to live with after a divorce. Your parents are being ridiculous about this lol.", "NTA.  Living abroad could be a wonderful experience for your daughter.  At the same time, there are also good reasons for letting her stay and you have the means to do so.  I don\u2019t think either option would make you TA, especially if you go into either option with eyes open to the possibility that she will change her mind and want to move in one direction or the other later.", "NTA. It is very difficult to have to transfer schools in your final years of high school.  You are making a decision that is the best for your family. Her grandparents are able to have a close relationship with their granddaughter that most do not have. \nMy only suggestion is to have your daughter initially come to Korea with your initial move. She would be out of school and would have made her first flight with the family. She can stay a month and fly back home and still have some summer to get ready for the next school year. Please make sure if possible to have a room for her in your new home. \nGood luck with your move and the next chapter in your life.", "NTA she will be better off finishing high school in her current school. It\u2019s going to be very disruptive for her to have to get adjusted to a new school in Korea for her senior year. Who cares what your parents think. You are the parents. Their opinion doesn\u2019t matter. I went to college at 17, so 16 is really not that far off. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re abandoning her to live alone. She will be with her grandparents.", "NTA\n\nI don't think there is one right answer here. There are pros and cons to both the daughter staying in the States with extended family and with the daughter living in Korea with her family. \n\nI lived in Korea as a child (military parent) and it was a great experience. I also had to move to a new state and new high school for my senior year and that was rough. Making friends, breaking into established friend groups that had been around since kindergarten was not easy at all. \n\nI think if the daughter stays behind in the States, there needs to be discussion about when and how often she will be able to travel to Korea for holidays and such. There needs to be consensus on how the in-laws will \"parent\" their grandchild--what is allowed, what isn't, appropriate consequences.  Will there be a curfew? What happens if she is 10 minutes late? Two hours late? The appropriate paperwork needs to be done so the grandparents can take her to the ER if needed, etc. How often will she need to touch base with her parents? My niece went to college on a different continent than where her parents live, and she was required to text once a day to show she was okay. It could be a single emoji, but she needed to send that text. (I think that stopped after her sophomore year.) You will never think of everything, but ironing out the details for everything you can think of beforehand will be worth it.", "Nta. I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your daughter is almost an adult and I think it\u2019s good you\u2019re allowing her to make choices for herself and her life. I think this is great for your relationship. Just make sure you let her know that there is always a place for her to stay with you in Korea, if she misses you, and that her decision can be reversible.", "NAH. If you're happy to leave her and if your daughter is desperate to stay, then what's the problem? Your parents can moan all they want, but it's not like you've stuck her in an orphanage, she'll be living with family. Frankly it makes much more sense to leave her because then her education won't be disrupted.", "NTA. Part of you probably feels bad because you think that she will miss your support (and you will miss her, of course!), but it seems like she really wants to stay, and since your in-laws are willing to have her, that seems like the best solution for everyone included. Don't let your parents guilt trip you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are jelly.  Living with the \"other\" grandparents is a slight to them, even if daughter living with them wasn't even an option.  Your parents are jealous of the outcome.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to THINK she knows what she wants, and will more than likely be fine living with your in-laws (and maybe flying to Korea on holidays to visit you?). Odds are she will regret this later, but right now it seems as if you have a workable solution.", "NTA it\u2019s a solution that works both for your daughter and the rest of your immediate family. Idk why your parents would have a problem with that.", "NTA do what's best for your daughters mental health and well-being.", "NTA. You are not abandoning her. She is living with her grandparents. Completely acceptable. Make sure they have everything in place as her guardians for medical emergency or school authorization, etc.", "NTA!!\nI went to 4 different high schools. It was fucking horrible. To yank her out of her life when she\u2019s so close to graduating would be cruel especially if you had the option of letting her stay with grandparents.", "Nta she's 16.  If this was a custody case the judge would let her decide.  Can she stay here during the school year and then come visit the while summer?", "NTA\n\nYou are putting your daughters feelings first and ensuring she has a safe and supportive place to live with family.  \n\nToo often people will drag their kids along when they move and end up driving a wedge between them because of the pain it causes.  You aren't doing this and are probably further strengthening what seems to be an already good relationship you have with her.", "NTA-sounds like this is what she wants to do and sounds like inlaw are ok with it.", "NTA! Amazing to finally see a parent on here that is putting their kids feelings FIRST during a move and being willing to compromise and do what\u2019s best for her instead of what\u2019s best for you and making her deal with it. Your daughter is so lucky to have such understanding and thoughtful parents.", "NTA. Distance does not mean anything with cell phones, FaceTime, and internet access, so you will still be a very active part of your daughter\u2019s life.

Just make sure your in-laws provide a somewhat parental role. I have two concerns from all the crazy stuff I read in Reddit:  unplanned pregnancy (please make sure you have THE TALK, even if not the first time, before you leave) and if your daughter is college-bound, guidance through the process.

Not exactly your situation, but having support system in place is key.", "NTA.  With modern technology, you will be able to talk to her regularly and follow her.

She's 16, and it's totally fair to let her pick a reasonable plan for where to live. Tell your family to think of it like boarding school. I'd suggest setting up a weekly family call and figuring out having her spend some school breaks with you guys in Korea.

My parents made me move from my hometown when I was 15. It was miserable, and I was so angry with them. I had an awful time adjusting, and it hurt our relationship for a long time. We went from a big city to a small town, and I did not know how to relate to these passive-aggressive Midwest nice kids, and more than one had some anti-Semitic things to say.

Ironically enough we would go months long stretches without seeing each other because of his deployments. \n\nI see zero problems with allowing your teen to stay with grandparents to finish out their senior year in a school/community they have known their whole lives.

Moving to a nation where she'll have to learn a completely new language while simultaneously finishing her schooling, try to befriend people who have already established their social heirarchy, and leave her boyfriend would be super disruptive to her in a way that it won't be for the younger kids or for you and her husband.  This includes the practical: is she thinking of going to your local college?  She can kiss that in-state tuition goodbye, and while there are excellent Korean colleges she's not going to be a great candidate for them with only a year and a half of the language under her belt.", "NTA.

You aren't abandoning your daughter if this is what she wants. This sounds like the best scenario for all involved here.

But I bet down the road into adulthood she\u2019ll look back on that and regret the opportunity mess to see another place in the world and have that experience. but if you can\u2019t get her to see that now, then talking with her and the others that she will be staying with and working out a good plan is not a bad idea.

It started to make impacts on high school because we moved to a new state each time.  We finally moved to the state I am in how during junior year of high school.  By the end of that year, my dad was not sure he had a job still and was planning to move.  To another state.  Each move to a new state created a delimma for me--I had to play catch up on required courses for graduation and in some cases had to wait to the next year to get the class but we moved.  This time I was ready to beg and plead if I had to to stay because my aunt and grandparents lived in the area where we did and the school district.  I wanted to stay to make sure that I finished senior year at this school and not have to try playing catch up in a new state.  Lucky for my dad, he kept his job.  I am pretty sure my parents would have allowed it taking into consideration that I would have been maybe an extra year playing catch up on requirements if we moves again.  This way your daughter can continue her education and not have to make up classes that she may have missed for graduation requirements in Korea.  She also can continue her activities, be with her friends, etc.", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s about time to talk to your daughter about what she wants and the realities that come with this.\n\nWhile In laws are willing to help host her.

I had friends, and I didn't want to up and leave like I did when I left Hawaii. So my dad asked my aunt if I could stay with her and I did. I lived with her until I moved out and got my own place with my bf at 19. My dad visited every year of course so it's not like I felt abandoned or anything. It was my choice.

I had to deal with it alone. The emotional support of transitioning to adulthood was not there.\n\nI think it's selfish to have a family and uproot them like that especially with a child that is an older teenager, your daughter really didn't have a choice because she is right, she would not have had time to acclimate to finish school properly.", "NTA\nIf your daughter wants to stay with her paternal grandparents and finish high school with her friends that is not abandonment.

I would, however, make sure that your daughter agrees to visit you for things like spring break and over the holidays. But this is the sort of thing that is going to go a long way towards making her feel like she is understood and is an independent person whose feelings are validated.\n\nIs this job posting temporary?

Often in cases like this he can have it added to his contract that they will fly your daughter to visit you at least once a year, at least until she\u2019s 18. I don\u2019t know if money is tight but international flights are always expensive. I think it would be very good for you to assure your daughter that even if she stays you do want her to visit you and her to come visit as well. Just because she would rather stay doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for her to say bye to you and I think it would be great to reassure her that even though you made this decision together you still want her to remain close to you.

I had panic attacks the whole year, was suicidal for a while, and was generally awful to my whole family. I was so miserable.\n\nIf you can give her the option to not go through what I went through, please do.

And have a viable option for her to stay", "NTA. You're not abandoning her, she wants this. Aren't they happy she'll be staying closer? I had a friend in primary school whose family happened to move to a rural town around the same time my family did. His family came, he stayed with other relatives because the town didn't have many opportunities for his extracurriculars. It worked out for him last I heard.\n\nI hated moving at first, I had lost all my friends and it took me a year to stop telling constant stories about 'when I still lived in x...'. Thing is, it was only a three hour drive away from my old home. I could still visit people if I wanted to when we returned to see family. I could make new friends because I spoke the same language and expected to stay for the next several years (plus my previous friendships were mostly limited to school hours anyway). Your daughter doesn't have any of that. Visiting from another country is much harder. Making friends is harder with a language barrier. Even if she becomes fluent overnight, a year or so isn't much time to bond with people and she'll wait it out in misery before running back to the life she's known for so much longer. She has a committed boyfriend she can't casually abandon or replace. She'll obviously miss you when you're gone, but it will hurt less than missing everyone else while feeling so isolated and having no support system other than parents who forced her into this new unwanted lifestyle. \n\nI think giving her this offer shows you're paying attention to her feelings and treating her like an individual person and not your property to be packed up and shipped away when you feel like it. She will appreciate you for it and not grow resentful. It's different for the younger kids, they're more dependent on you and probably don't have as many strong ties to your current home. They have plenty of time to adjust and make new friends, your daughter doesn't without leaving lots of things behind.", "NTA.

I had a hard time acclimating and I already knew the language quite well. Making friends is hard, giving up old friends is even harder and I wasn't even that social as a kid; your daughter seems very deeply connected to her friends, it will be infinitely harder on her.\n\nShe has a place to stay with family who cares for her. You guys will certainly be visiting back and she can vacation in Korea to see you guys sometimes.\n\n#But!\n\nDo keep in mind that the distance will be VERY HARD for you guys.

If this is the case, then this is a gentle YTA situation because this could be easily framed as an opportunity for your daughter to experience a new culture, make new friends, have a new adventure, etc. while keeping your family together.  She can continue to easily connect with her boyfriend by phone/vid/email/chat/etc. and maybe even have him come visit.

You should be aware that if she doesn\u2019t go, she will be more isolated from your family\u2019s shared history/story-making and it is inevitable that she will be left out of a lot of exciting experiences and memories\u2026the kinds of experiences that will be sure to create a unique closeness between the family members who do go.", "NTA you aren\u2019t leaving her for your convenience but for her own mental well being.

They're making a problem out of nothing, kind of like you are right now.", "that's not a compromise...\n\na compromise is we each give something up and we each get something w can live with/want.\n\ni think you mean yield or cave. Because leaving her behind is a compromise. The let her stay (although they want her) to ensure financial stability (which they may need). In turn she gets to stay (which educationally speaking might benefit her the most and socially) and gives up seeing her parents daily (which may or may not be a con, but they should offer that if she changes her mind they will have a game plan for how to get her to them).\n\nOPs husband might have the option to go or leave the company based on the wording. his company asked him to go over seas but OP comments getting a job in his field could take a while.\n\nhis staying means daughter gets her desire of staying but may sacrifice something else.", "It's not like we don't have free video chat, and she'll be living with relatives, so it's not like she'll be responsible for paying rent, cooking everything for herself, doing everything it takes to keep a household.", "OP noted that daughter will be 18 in 14 months so that means 17 in two months, before they even leave. Plenty of kids leave for college at that age.", "She's almost seventeen. It's right in the post that she'll be 18 in 14 months. And she isn't without any support. She's staying with family and the rest of her support system. At her own request/threat", "She's 16 IF she goes to college she will lose most of those friends and her bf. Pretty much all of the reasons she stayed.", "Going to an English speaking school. Korean a very hard language to learn and she\u2019ll most likely leave to go to uni a year after the move. I learned Korean in HS and I couldn\u2019t have meaningful conversation for the life of me. I had a teacher who was born and raised in Korea and knew English very well. It didn\u2019t help that I only had 2 years of experience because the school cut Korean 3 and 4. There is no use in upending her life in a place where she\u2019ll probably never learn the language properly or stay more than 2 years. Unless she\u2019s living in Seoul, she\u2019ll most likely won\u2019t even get English instruction anyway.", "Yeha that's why I said nobody is an asshole here. I get the OP's parents worry as well.. everyone's trying to do right towards the teen.", "That's why I said hopefully they'd get her into an international school where the curriculum is in english.", "I get your point I just don't really feel the same way that you do about it", "Leaving your family and life behind for work is something I am just against on a fundamental level", "Fixed mindset.\n\nDeciding you cannot and will not live anywhere else that would be an incredible opportunity WITHOUT having tried it in the least is pretty much exemplifying that exactly.", "It's not if it's by choice. But if it's all you've ever known, it's not really a choice, is it?\n\nOf course she is saying that, she's trying to get her way. And she might manage for a bit, but realistically, good chances she adapts, makes friends (lots of Koreans speak English) and has a fantastic experience. If she totally fails at this, then sure, send her back for year 2 I guess.", "Not the same but either way, it's more that everything you are so sure of at 16 is an illusion of sorts. If it is what she wants after actually being exposed to more, fantastic.", "Not at all. If she tries it and then really can't hack it, no problem, she tried.", "Not the same but close enough anyhow all of this explains why so few americans have passports.", "Bc you think this is the FIRST time someone has done this!!?!?! lmao\n\nOh it must be impossible.", "I was 17 when I went away to college. It was all good.", "You're acting like teen experiences and friendships aren't valuable just because they usually end, and that's a very inaccurate and unkind attitude. \n\n20 years later, I'm still a little unhappy my parents wouldn't let me go to a sleepover the last night before my friend left for college. Their reasoning was that I'd been out with friends too much lately, and I needed to stay home and have a family dinner. \n\nBut since then, I've had countless family dinners, while that night was my last chance to be with that specific group of girls and do that specific style of dramatic teen girl slumber party. Even at the time, I knew the friendships wouldn't last, but I still valued those girls and wanted to celebrate our friendship while it still existed. I wish I'd gotten to go and had a proper chance to close out the friendship at a natural point. \n\nThe daughter's senior year isn't valuable because it will create permanent bonds. It's important because it's a fleeting moment that can't be recreated. Her family will always be there, and with the dad's job, it sounds like there will be plenty of opportunities to live in Korea, but this is her one chance to have a senior year with her childhood friends.", "She'll be able to go to college with people who SPEAK ENGLISH. She'd probably be miserable for her last year of high school in a brand new country, and either way go back to the US for college. Having missed out on all the fun senior year things she's been looking forward to.\n\n\nYou sound like you just think teenagers can't make decisions. Yes, they aren't perfect, but in this case, I can't see any benefit to her to moving.", "Tbh, I thought the same. I probably would for e my kids to go with me even though the experience would be difficult as I view international experiences to be incredibly formative and important....that said I think the mom is listening to her kid and what she wants and that's good parenting too. She is NTA and has worked out logistics to make everyone happy and that's to be lauded.", "I mean it\u2019s likely she\u2019d go to an international school, not a Korean one", "Aren\u2019t international schools still based on the same curriculum as their host country? Small towns in the US don\u2019t typically have rigorous education.", "Or maybe she's happy where she is. Could be as simple as that.\n\nNot wanting to give up being very happy with where and who you are to move halfway across the world to a country where you don't know the language or anybody in no way makes her small minded.", "Fine, you\u2019ve convinced me. Now practice what you preach, drop everything and move halfway across the world to a country that you\u2019ve never been to.\n\nOh, you can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s inconvenient for you or doesn\u2019t work for your lifestyle/obligations \n? Ridiculous excuse, you\u2019re just small minded and have a fixed mindset.", "You really trying to argue that every single person who was born in a small town and is content to stay there is small minded?", "Lol", "She can still go to college in USA. Are you 16 because this sounds very much like a 16 year olds response. I have 4 teens so not an expert but very experienced.", "I never said she was an asshole I don't think mom is. I was answering the username52 question. Some many people in reddit have terrible reading comprehension skills. It's amazing.", "Actually I've already done that, thanks. At 17 and 31.\n\nAnd - a teenager with ZERO obligations moving with her actual parents is zero comparable anyhow.", "No, a specific 16 year old who has the opportunity (to go with her family in ideal circumstances) bc obviously, that's not most and that is the current situation.", "No, I'm 37.\n\n\nYou still haven't explained why you think she'd be happier spending her senior year of high school in Korea rather than in the US, other than \"FOMO\"? What would she get out of that year in Korea?", "I was agreeing with you but also wanted to get my vote in. Sorry for the confusion!", "Well, do it again! You don\u2019t want to develop a fixed mindset after all!", "Lol good luck in life, sounds like you need it."]}
