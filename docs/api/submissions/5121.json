In your rating criteria, were you rating them where the highest rating was \"the best a person could ever be at this quality\" or \"the best a person could be after 5 months?\"  If it's the former, you're definitely an AH.  Also, what's the learning curve for this job like?  Since the job apparently requires a college degree, I'd expect it's a job that requires a fair amount of background knowledge, but still has some on-the-job learning that needs to take place.  If you failed to consider this in your rating, you're likely an AH. Also, what was the rating scale like?  Was it 3-2-1 where 1 is the worst (if so, the rating system needs to be revised to allow for nuance) or was it out of 10 (in which case, you were probably an AH).  Finally, were you trying to help this employee develop into an effective member of your team, or were you uninterested in helping them grow?  If it's the latter, you're an AH.  \n\n\nWhile employee reviews are often used for pay raises/promotions/etc, they're much more about effective feedback when someone is new to a job.

You are the worse kind of manager.\n\nAs a leader myself, you should be supportive and figure out what is the issue with the employee. Sometimes, it is them. However, a boss (not going to call you a leader since you are far from one) who doesn\u2019t explain why an employee is failing is ensuring that they will fail. \n\nThe employee wanted to meet with you to improve and essentially you told them they are SOL with a boss like you.

It's barely professional feedback, you should really look into your own management skills.\n\nAlso, YTA, he's doing his job with good quality but there's room for improvement, how does this warrant the worst review possible?", "That\u2019s not feedback.  YTA.  As a manager you should be giving some amount of training and setting your expectations up front.

For example, I give my dudes job X, and they know how to do it.  It takes them two hours.  If I and another coworker did job X it would take us 45 minutes.  Why?  We have 10 year\u2019s experience to their 5 weeks.  \n\nAre you even allowing for that?  Yeah ultimately the job may not be a good fit, but if you can\u2019t be bothered to provide training in the form of tips, tricks, deadlines, etc it\u2019s your fault.\n\nFor my work, I know why someone is slower.

First off, your subordinates shouldn\u2019t be the ones having to initiate feedback meetings.

Second, telling someone they\u2019re \u201ctoo slow\u201d *and* putting it on them to figure out why is *terrible* management. *Help them* figure out why.

That's not 2-3 months. You can even get your time frame consistent. And now they been there for 5 months. Is it exactly 5 months or more like 3.5-5 months? Or 4-5 months?\nYTA.
