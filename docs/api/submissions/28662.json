For most of that time I\u2019ve done most of the cooking and cleaning. He is basically only responsible for making his breakfast and doing his laundry and I did everything else. But 4 months ago I cut my hand really deep when cooking and it hasn\u2019t healed right. I have trouble gripping things and my doc thinks I need surgery. \n\nIn that time I couldn\u2019t put my hand underwater or flex it so I had my bf do the cooking and cleaning. Instead he just Uber eatted every meal. We split expenses so my food budget went from $300 a month to $800 a month because I paid for half the Uber eatting. When I complained he said he brought home food so what else did I want? Before my hand injury I made dinner every night and he came home to a stirfy rice and soup. He knows how to cook I\u2019ve seen him do it. Not well but he can make a few dishes. But he never did. \n\nWith cleaning he let our apartment get disgusting. I asked him to wash our sheets (which I normally do) and he argued with me until the sheets were a month old before he threw them in the wash. It was so infuriating getting him to do anything and we have a cat and he let the poop build up in the litter box until our cat refused to use it. I was so frustrated and called him lazy and a man child to his face when we were arguing over chores again and he got mad and said I was ungrateful and nitpicking him. I\u2019m sick of this and if my hand needs surgery I\u2019ll have to live like this until it\u2019s done and I heal.", "created_utc": 1696979648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174z64o/aita_for_calling_my_bf_lazy_and_a_man_child/", "score": 264, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you want it? He doesn't cook though he can. He forces you to expend large amounts of money instead of cooking. He won't clean. He expects you to do all these things, however. Is this the relationship you want? My feeling is you can do a lot better, and being alone would be a hell of a lot better. NTA", "NTA, do you want to continye a relationship with this man? You cut your hand now, imagine you break a leg or have another issue. You don't seem to have a partner on whom you can rely to support you and alleviate some of the burden you are carrying in the relationship.", "NTA.\n\nPlease reconsider this relationship.  I know I know you love him, you've been together 5 years.  Thing is, this is who he is..... And through the rest of your life you are going to have problems, health issues, financial issues and such.  He just isn't going to be a person you can count on.\n\nIn the mean time, go to the store and buy some cheap premade stuff like canned soup and such.  Make your own dinner.  Tell him you can't afford eating out all the time.  You had wished he could step up and cook and take care of you the way you have in the last 3 years but you realize he just isn't going to so unless he's paying you don't need him to pick you up take out.\n\nThen start saving your money and looking around for where you might want to live post BF.  Maybe wait til after the surgery so you can save up extra money.  I'd say so he could help you with that but face it he's not going to be very useful with the surgery either.  I mean he can give you a ride to and from the hospital.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously reallllllly think about what the future looks like.  What happens when you have kids?  When one of your parents is sick and needs help?  When you are pregnant (maybe even with things that confine you to bed or reduce your ability to do things).  For the weeks after you have a baby if you have a C-section there is lifting restrictions.  What about if you get cancer which hits many people throughout there life?  Is this who you want as a partner?", "NTA - It's bad enough that you were basically doing all of the housework prior to your injury, but now you also know that you cannot rely on him in times of emergency.", "Nta, \u201cthrough sickness and health\u201d is this really where you see your future? One injury away from living in a shit hole.", "NTA for being frustrated with him. My wife and I split the housework.

As soon as you're able, take your cat and move out. Leave him in his pigsty.", "nta dump him", "NTA - but let this be a lesson. When you do an unfair amount of household responsibilities and allow this way of life to continue for a long time without speaking up, your partner will get used to you doing the lion's share of household responsibilities. They are not likely to pick up the slack even when you are injured. I can't imagine you wanting to stay in this one sided relationship. I am also assuming you both have jobs and close to equal responsibilities outside of the home.", "NTA but he's grown used to not having to lift a finger in this household and can't adjust to having to do some work because you have been doing it for him. I feel like he isn't putting in any effort because he thinks once your hand heals, he can go back to doing nothing. Ask him if he'd keep being like this if your hand injury was permanent.", "NTA. Kick him out and hire someone to clean once a week.

You need to sit down and have a serious talk with him. I\u2019ve always thought that just because you\u2019re a female, being expected to do just about all of the household chores is ridiculous.

He has raised the big red flag.  His behaviour will not change and will probably worsen over time.  Could you put up with it for another 2, 5, 10 years?  I suspect it is seriously time to reconsider being in a relationship with him.", "NTA. This is not the man for you. It\u2019s better to get away now than end up trapped and feeling like there\u2019s no way out. He\u2019s shown you who he is and what life with him will be like. You\u2019ll be a maid, not a partner.", "NTA.\n\nYou are seeing that he is benefitting from your presence, but he contributes little to nothing. He is lazy and immature, just like you said.", "I\u2019m sorry OP.Sometimes people fall in love with who they think a person is -and after they marry find out their new mate was living behind a facade .In your case there was no facade other than him making you think he loves you.This is not loving behavior .YWBTA if you stay with him.\nIs there any Family  who would help out;let you live with them after you have surgery ? \nHe might get even worse if you have a bad outcome from surgery.", "I\u2019d be out.

He saw your kindness and took it for granted. \n\nHe was always this. It took your time of need to show it. \n\nYou did all this labor because you assumed that it was appreciated and if you needed his help he would give it happily. \n\nNow you know it isn\u2019t appreciated, because he can\u2019t be bothered to acknowledge all you did by trying to replicate any of it. And you also know: he doesn\u2019t have your back.

And he doesn't love you if he's okay with you carrying that burden.", "NTA- you called it correctly. I wouldn\u2019t want to live with a person who would not do the necessary jobs. Don\u2019t pay for half the UBER. Hire a cleaner.", "NTA:  But what did you expect? For 3 years you treated him like a child. So why are you shocked you behave like one.", "ESH - You have become his mommy for the 3 years, you allowed that to happen by going ahead and doing pretty much everything.  Yes, he is a lazy bum literally sucking the life out of you.  You should have set boundaries early on to the relationship but didn't.  So don't cry now, you largely made him what he is today, but act.  To fix it, you need to put your foot down and continue keeping the boundary even if your hands heals better. First, determine an equitable chore workload between you two and stick to it, and second set a budget of what the two of you are able to contribute to the reasonable bills of the household and no Uber Eats or Door Dash that's busts the budget for the lazy one who doesn't want to cook,  And finally, you need to put your foot down if these things don't change fast and he fails to pull his own weight you will dump him at local Ladies Garden Club where he can maybe find the mommy of his dreams.  But you aren't it and never will be again.", "Do you work or stay at home?

Grow a spine and stand up for yourself. It's called weaponized incompetence. He knew if he pretended to suck at it, you would handle it. Stop paying for uber eats.

NTA. dump his ass.", "NTA, I\u2019m physically and mentally disabled, nearly faint when I stand or walk and cook, clean, do all laundry and keep the house nice. my boyfriend helps if I need it when I\u2019m home but I stay on top of it because i love and care for him and our home", "NTA - do not marry him. Kick him out back to mommy.", "Oy, NTA of course, but how could it possibly take 3 years of living together for it to become so clear what a loser this guy is?", "NTA\n\nThis is how he\u2019ll treat you in sickness and it doesn\u2019t sound like he really treated you any better in health.  Perhaps he should move out.", "You are in fact not required to live like this for any longer. Kick his @$$ to the curb. Don\u2019t you have any friends or family that can help you out?", "why are you together? sex so good? NTA", "NTA. Imagine having kids with this man. When You're postpartum and can barely walk from the pain of stitches pulling in your vagina and you've just lost a shit ton of blood so everything takes so much more effort, you haven't slept more then 2 hours a night for days and you're tied down feeding your baby for even up to 9 hours a day - you still have to be the one cooking And cleaning or else your house will be unhygienic and unfit for a newborn and your diet will be unfit for healing and producing milk. On top of that he probably wouldn'tpull his weight with the child eother. This man is extremely narcissistic and selfish. This is not the future you want. The longer you delay breaking up, the longer it will take to find someone who is your equal in the relationship and who gives equal energy, care, love and consideration.", "NTA. But he won't change his behavior, not for himself and not for you. You are injured and even then he doesn't do more. His laziness will be a constant problem between you two, and it will be more and more frustrating.", "YTA for the way you speak to your partner. Its obvious all the female commenters are going to take your side because of course they stick together and this is reddit. However you could discuss this like an adult instead of name calling your partner. This is only a glimpse at how you talk to him so its not surprising he doesn't want to spend more energy while around you. Both of you should reconsider the relationship. Him for the way you speak to him and you for a partner that is more fitting to your lifestyle.", "NTA. Throw his entire lazy butt out.  He will not get any less useless around the house.", "Moments like this show you who you are dating. \nThink of it this way.\nYou ONLY cut your hand and while incontinent, it's not deadly, or super life altering. \nWhat if you were in an accident? \nWhat if you fell ill? \nIs this person capable of doing everything they'd need to do to take care of you when you age? \n\nDump. Them. \n\nIf your life isn't made EASIER by your partner you're better off single. \nHalf that mess. Half that money. Was because of him. He wanted to order out, he should cover the difference. \nHe doesn't want to do the laundry. Hire someone. Out of his $. But if he's not adding value, he's taking it away.", "NTA - this is terrible behaviour by him. It is reasonable to expect him, not only to produce food, but to be able to stick to a reasonable budget so that you can save money for bigger things. If he can't, and can't care for you, and can't do basic cleaning - is this what you want for the rest of your life. \n\nI hope your hand heals in time but this might prove to be a useful early warning about whether he's the right person to be in a relationship with.", "Why are you still wasting your time with this toddler NTA. Run girl.", "NTA. Been in a very similar situation and here's what I learned. If you are with a lazy person and someone who takes your housework for granted, you need to set better boundaries and specifically ask for what you want. That means requesting for him to cook and clean up after, itemize what you want him to help with and what will happen if he doesn't (ie get a cleaner to do it and take the money from the common fund or not contribute to some expenses until that is reimbursed). See if he learns from it or you need to be chores police and tell him how it makes you feel. Then think about what else he brings to the relationship to compensate for this (if anything).\n\nIf he doesn't hear you, then yes - it will be the same when you are recovering from surgery. Good luck with your recovery.", "This doesn't get better, only worse. Rethink your relationship", "Guard your birth control OP, and consider doubling up methods.  The *last* thing you want to do is have a child with this person.  You think it's bad now with the cat litter, just wait until he decides shitty diapers can just stay on because they aren't leaking yet.\n\nHe's showing you who he is.  Will you believe him?", "My husband is somehow similar, besides throwing out the trash that would stay there a whole day sometimes, he doesn\u2019t do anything else but I do. \n\nI stopped telling him, or asking him, because I\u2019ve been judged as \u201ctoo bossy\u201d for him.", "5 years living together for 3.\nYTH\nBreak up", "Forget any other temporary injury.

I didn't even have to ask him.", "Ungrateful for what lol? That was my first thought", "Yup. That's why so many men are upset about \"independent women.\" It's because they can no longer subjugate women and use them to their advantage.

Mine came in 3 x per week cleaned, wiped things down emptied the dishwasher. Paid for by my insurance.

I'm they have simple rules they have to follow, but i don't remember the details. If you can't use you hand you will need help with these taskes. Also a home heath aide is better than your boyfriend. They are 100% there for you, lonely? They will talk to you. I'd get rid of the guy as soon as you can. I was in bed for months from a car accident and couldn't care for myself. My partner stepped up.
