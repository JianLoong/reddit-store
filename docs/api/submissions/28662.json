For most of that time I\u2019ve done most of the cooking and cleaning. He is basically only responsible for making his breakfast and doing his laundry and I did everything else. But 4 months ago I cut my hand really deep when cooking and it hasn\u2019t healed right. I have trouble gripping things and my doc thinks I need surgery. \n\nIn that time I couldn\u2019t put my hand underwater or flex it so I had my bf do the cooking and cleaning. Instead he just Uber eatted every meal. We split expenses so my food budget went from $300 a month to $800 a month because I paid for half the Uber eatting. When I complained he said he brought home food so what else did I want? Before my hand injury I made dinner every night and he came home to a stirfy rice and soup. He knows how to cook I\u2019ve seen him do it. Not well but he can make a few dishes. But he never did. \n\nWith cleaning he let our apartment get disgusting. I asked him to wash our sheets (which I normally do) and he argued with me until the sheets were a month old before he threw them in the wash. It was so infuriating getting him to do anything and we have a cat and he let the poop build up in the litter box until our cat refused to use it. I was so frustrated and called him lazy and a man child to his face when we were arguing over chores again and he got mad and said I was ungrateful and nitpicking him. I\u2019m sick of this and if my hand needs surgery I\u2019ll have to live like this until it\u2019s done and I heal.", "created_utc": 1696979648, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174z64o/aita_for_calling_my_bf_lazy_and_a_man_child/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you want it? He doesn't cook though he can. He forces you to expend large amounts of money instead of cooking. He won't clean. He expects you to do all these things, however. Is this the relationship you want? My feeling is you can do a lot better, and being alone would be a hell of a lot better. NTA", "NTA, do you want to continye a relationship with this man? You cut your hand now, imagine you break a leg or have another issue. You don't seem to have a partner on whom you can rely to support you and alleviate some of the burden you are carrying in the relationship.", "NTA.\n\nPlease reconsider this relationship.  I know I know you love him, you've been together 5 years.  Thing is, this is who he is..... And through the rest of your life you are going to have problems, health issues, financial issues and such.  He just isn't going to be a person you can count on.\n\nIn the mean time, go to the store and buy some cheap premade stuff like canned soup and such.  Make your own dinner.  Tell him you can't afford eating out all the time.  You had wished he could step up and cook and take care of you the way you have in the last 3 years but you realize he just isn't going to so unless he's paying you don't need him to pick you up take out.\n\nThen start saving your money and looking around for where you might want to live post BF.  Maybe wait til after the surgery so you can save up extra money.  I'd say so he could help you with that but face it he's not going to be very useful with the surgery either.  I mean he can give you a ride to and from the hospital.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously reallllllly think about what the future looks like.  What happens when you have kids?  When one of your parents is sick and needs help?  When you are pregnant (maybe even with things that confine you to bed or reduce your ability to do things).  For the weeks after you have a baby if you have a C-section there is lifting restrictions.  What about if you get cancer which hits many people throughout there life?  Is this who you want as a partner?", "NTA - It's bad enough that you were basically doing all of the housework prior to your injury, but now you also know that you cannot rely on him in times of emergency.", "Nta, \u201cthrough sickness and health\u201d is this really where you see your future? One injury away from living in a shit hole.", "NTA for being frustrated with him. My wife and I split the housework. Allowing things to get disgusting simply because he doesn\u2019t want to take a few min to clean up is not cool", "NTA. \n\nStart planning your exit. As soon as you're able, take your cat and move out. Leave him in his pigsty.", "nta dump him", "NTA - but let this be a lesson. When you do an unfair amount of household responsibilities and allow this way of life to continue for a long time without speaking up, your partner will get used to you doing the lion's share of household responsibilities. They are not likely to pick up the slack even when you are injured. I can't imagine you wanting to stay in this one sided relationship. I am also assuming you both have jobs and close to equal responsibilities outside of the home.", "NTA but he's grown used to not having to lift a finger in this household and can't adjust to having to do some work because you have been doing it for him. I feel like he isn't putting in any effort because he thinks once your hand heals, he can go back to doing nothing. Ask him if he'd keep being like this if your hand injury was permanent.", "NTA. Kick him out and hire someone to clean once a week. Ask friends and family to help you make meals that you can freeze and re-heat.", "NTA\n\nA \"bangmaid\" is usually never the correct term, it's more like \"bangmommy\" in actuality for an uncomfortably large section of these men. \n\nPut him up for adoption.", "NTA also your cat can get sick from holding their pee also sometimes if they stop using the liter box they will continue to go else where even if you do clean it", "Calling you \u201cungrateful\u201d for doing less than the absolute minimum of keeping a clean environment to live in\u2026. This toddler is a joke and a deadbeat. Dump him", "NTA. If you choose to stay with him, going forward the household chores should be split up evenly. You need to sit down and have a serious talk with him. I\u2019ve always thought that just because you\u2019re a female, being expected to do just about all of the household chores is ridiculous. I\u2019d talk to him and make clear expectations and let him know if he doesn\u2019t give 100%, as you do, then you\u2019re out.", "I hope this loser has some redeeming  qualities, because he sounds like a colossal burden. Did he move right from mommy\u2019s house to an apartment with you?  He\u2019s a spoiled lazy kid. Break the news to him that you\u2019re not interested in having a perpetual pouty child to look after. It\u2019s time for the big-boy pants, or he can go back to being single. NTA and good luck.", "Nta and no you don't have to deal with this anymore. LEAVE!", "NTA. Are you sure you want to spend the rest of your life taking care of this guy?", "NTA.  He has raised the big red flag.  His behaviour will not change and will probably worsen over time.  Could you put up with it for another 2, 5, 10 years?  I suspect it is seriously time to reconsider being in a relationship with him.", "NTA. This is not the man for you. It\u2019s better to get away now than end up trapped and feeling like there\u2019s no way out. He\u2019s shown you who he is and what life with him will be like. You\u2019ll be a maid, not a partner.", "NTA.\n\nYou are seeing that he is benefitting from your presence, but he contributes little to nothing. He is lazy and immature, just like you said.", "I\u2019m sorry OP.Sometimes people fall in love with who they think a person is -and after they marry find out their new mate was living behind a facade .In your case there was no facade other than him making you think he loves you.This is not loving behavior .YWBTA if you stay with him.\nIs there any Family  who would help out;let you live with them after you have surgery ? \nHe might get even worse if you have a bad outcome from surgery.", "I\u2019d be out. The comments being like \u201cyou\u2019re also to blame because you allowed this\u201d are\u2026weird. \n\nLike yeah there\u2019s a lesson here and it\u2019s that as an adult, you teach people how to treat you by the boundaries you put in place. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you made him into this. He saw your kindness and took it for granted. \n\nHe was always this. It took your time of need to show it. \n\nYou did all this labor because you assumed that it was appreciated and if you needed his help he would give it happily. \n\nNow you know it isn\u2019t appreciated, because he can\u2019t be bothered to acknowledge all you did by trying to replicate any of it. And you also know: he doesn\u2019t have your back. Not only Will he not take accountability and proactively do these things- he actively fights you on changing bedding and not letting a cat live in it\u2019s own filth \n\nThat is not an act of love. \n\nNTA but yikes.", "NTA. \n\nI'm so sorry, but he's not your partner if you do all the chores. And he doesn't love you if he's okay with you carrying that burden.", "NTA- you called it correctly. I wouldn\u2019t want to live with a person who would not do the necessary jobs. Don\u2019t pay for half the UBER. Hire a cleaner.", "NTA:  But what did you expect? For 3 years you treated him like a child. So why are you shocked you behave like one.", "ESH - You have become his mommy for the 3 years, you allowed that to happen by going ahead and doing pretty much everything.  Yes, he is a lazy bum literally sucking the life out of you.  You should have set boundaries early on to the relationship but didn't.  So don't cry now, you largely made him what he is today, but act.  To fix it, you need to put your foot down and continue keeping the boundary even if your hands heals better. First, determine an equitable chore workload between you two and stick to it, and second set a budget of what the two of you are able to contribute to the reasonable bills of the household and no Uber Eats or Door Dash that's busts the budget for the lazy one who doesn't want to cook,  And finally, you need to put your foot down if these things don't change fast and he fails to pull his own weight you will dump him at local Ladies Garden Club where he can maybe find the mommy of his dreams.  But you aren't it and never will be again.", "Do you work or stay at home? Does he?", "If he didn\u2019t deserve it, YATA. \n\nIf you really believe he deserved it, NTA but leave him. \n\nIf you want to change him, YATA.", "In the heat of the moment you called him names which are apparently accurate. Its not the best way to argue. So are you TA? No one is perfect so no you\u2019re not. If you apologized for the way you said it could it open the door to say it again but more productively? And just how are you ungrateful?", "[removed]", "No. NTA. He's worthless. Women living with men without legal protections will always come out on the losing side. Studies have been done on how useless men can be when their wives and gfs are ill or injured.", "NTA. Think long & hard about whether or not you want to spend your life with someone like this. If you need help because you're injured & he can't get it together, what are you going to do? And it'll get worse with kids. This isn't someone you can rely on. This is a typical \"man wants gf/wife to be another mommy\".", "NTA.\n\n>We split expenses so my food budget went from $300 a month to $800 a month because I paid for half the Uber eatting. \n\nWhy the fuck did you pay this though? I would have refused.", "Girl, YTA to yourself. Why are you still with this man? He has been using you for 3 years! Why have you been putting up doing all the cooking and cleaning for so long! Grow a spine and stand up for yourself. It's called weaponized incompetence. He knew if he pretended to suck at it, you would handle it. Stop paying for uber eats. You will pay for what groceries used to cost. If he won't do the work, he can pay for his laziness. Stop enabling him.", "NTA - and an idiot if your decide to have children with this man", "\"I\u2019m sick of this and if my hand needs surgery I\u2019ll have to live like this until it\u2019s done and I heal.\"\n\nAnd if you stay with him youllve have to live like this the rest of you life. NTA.\n\nDump is ass and let him live in filth on his own.", "Nta update us when you dump him.", "If I had to take a shot for every person who's going to suggest breaking up with him I'm likely to get very drunk. She can definitely do better than this leech!", "Is this someone you've thought about having kids with?", "Excellent term. Will steal.", "Excellent term. Will steal.", "Excellent term. Will steal.", "It would be so much easier to just break up with him. She'll end up doing more work trying to get him to do HIS share than she would have otherwise.
