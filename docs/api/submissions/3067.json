The reason she doesn\u2019t uber to her job is the cost / distance it would require. just doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nThe issue is that she has been using my car. The reason she doesn\u2019t have a vehicle is because 2 years ago she got in a DUI accident and totaled her car. The payoff she got for it was squandered away because it took a year for her to start looking for work again. She\u2019s had troubles with substance abuse and is doing good now but for a couple years it put a ton of strain on our relationship and our finances. The DUI was the result of getting fired at work for drinking on the job and getting in an accident on her way home. \n\nSo now we have no real down payment except for our savings which is about 25K. I told her we could use 5K but I was pretty firm on that since our savings have taken a decent hit through the years from her unstable job status & legal fees for the DUI.  \n\nThe real contentious part is that she usually had a sportier car. Had a mustang when we met, then a Mini Cooper, then a Nissan 370Z. The 370Z is what she totaled. I always had the family car.

She got in a f'd up DUI and you resent that for reasons that are extremely valid, but you need to figure out how to resolve the finances of that situation, however it gets split up, so that both of you can feel that it's over and done with and won't use it against each other in future arguments. Otherwise it'll never stop.

The finances are messy but this situation is really about acknowledging the full impact that the DUI had on both of you. Couples counseling. Yall need to sort stuff out.\n\nESH because it just seems like the new-car-buying-competition is a bad idea for both of you in terms of how you're approaching it and each other, so I'm gently docking you for that, but I'm criticizing your approach not your conclusion.

You can easily spend close to a grand a month that could have gone towards retiring comfortably vs working into your old age, retire early instead, pay for a kid\u2019s college, a parents nursing home if god forbid needed, your own home instead of renting, etc. Even if you both get cars for $300 a month each add that up over the lifetime of the loan then add interest if you invested it for 20-30 years.

In your original post it was worded in a way that sounded a bit competitive in terms of \"if she gets this, I want that\". I still think you should use a third person to help talk out the finances and how you want to distribute them moving forward, but whatever you decide, whether it's 50/50 or 30/70 etc., it might be better to set those boundaries as a **dollar amount** rather than \"I want the car that has the black trim package\". A dollar value boundary makes everything else a balancing act (\"do you really need the black trim?\") so you're more aware of the actual features that matter to you. \n\nTalk about how much you're going to set aside for both cars, in specific finite values, and how that will be split up between the family/sport one. Once you agree on those limits (that'll be the hard part) then it's no longer a competition after that because for BOTH cars, yours or hers, you've got your set budget. Then for her car (and later for yours) you can team up to each help the other one during their search; the two of you versus all the car dealerships in the world, getting the most bang for your pre-established buck. Don't make it \"if you don't get this I can have that\". Set a slightly stricter limit on both vehicles (even if you're not distributing the $ equally on both) to save a bit o money, say 10-15%, to help get back on track, and then face the slightly more challenging car budget by acting like you're gonna get through it together. \n\nThat might be a better strategy so it's not about her trying to convince YOU about cupholders anymore.", "In 2007, my husband and I CHOSE to get a 1989 Toyota Corolla.
