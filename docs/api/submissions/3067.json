She\u2019s had troubles with substance abuse and is doing good now but for a couple years it put a ton of strain on our relationship and our finances. The DUI was the result of getting fired at work for drinking on the job and getting in an accident on her way home. \n\nSo now we have no real down payment except for our savings which is about 25K. I told her we could use 5K but I was pretty firm on that since our savings have taken a decent hit through the years from her unstable job status & legal fees for the DUI.  \n\nThe real contentious part is that she usually had a sportier car.

The finances are messy but this situation is really about acknowledging the full impact that the DUI had on both of you. Couples counseling. Yall need to sort stuff out.\n\nESH because it just seems like the new-car-buying-competition is a bad idea for both of you in terms of how you're approaching it and each other, so I'm gently docking you for that, but I'm criticizing your approach not your conclusion.

In your original post it was worded in a way that sounded a bit competitive in terms of \"if she gets this, I want that\". I still think you should use a third person to help talk out the finances and how you want to distribute them moving forward, but whatever you decide, whether it's 50/50 or 30/70 etc., it might be better to set those boundaries as a **dollar amount** rather than \"I want the car that has the black trim package\". A dollar value boundary makes everything else a balancing act (\"do you really need the black trim?\") so you're more aware of the actual features that matter to you. \n\nTalk about how much you're going to set aside for both cars, in specific finite values, and how that will be split up between the family/sport one. Once you agree on those limits (that'll be the hard part) then it's no longer a competition after that because for BOTH cars, yours or hers, you've got your set budget. Then for her car (and later for yours) you can team up to each help the other one during their search; the two of you versus all the car dealerships in the world, getting the most bang for your pre-established buck. Don't make it \"if you don't get this I can have that\". Set a slightly stricter limit on both vehicles (even if you're not distributing the $ equally on both) to save a bit o money, say 10-15%, to help get back on track, and then face the slightly more challenging car budget by acting like you're gonna get through it together. \n\nThat might be a better strategy so it's not about her trying to convince YOU about cupholders anymore.", "In 2007, my husband and I CHOSE to get a 1989 Toyota Corolla.

I am here to support her and be the breadwinner of the family.", "I agree 100%... reading alot of these comments has detached me a bit from the personal connection into a more rationale approach to it. She can have my car... only about $1500 to pay off. If she sticks to treatment and improvement then she'd have like $9K of trade in value and can have better options. Ive found a car I want that is very humble but still a bit fun... and I need a car in the coming months as my company returns to office. \n\nIt relieves a ton of tension... she's already been driving my car everyday for 3 months. Just stick it out 6 more and revisit. But also means I don't have to uber everywhere spending like $300 a month to do that. \n\nIt cuts alot of the tension... puts the ball in her court to build trust and work on recovery, gives her what she needs to just get to work, eases financial burdens and just lands on a better place.

Only has like $1500 to payoff. \n2) I found a cool used sports car for like $350 a month.... only $100 more than Im paying now if I take the $5K Id give her for downpayment and use it for that. \n3) If she's on the up and up then she can use the current care for a trade in six months from now and get like $8k for it. \n\nrelieves the immediate tension... doesn't lump debt and liability on her as much.

It\u2019s paid off, and no car payment feels way better than something new and sporty.

That way if I have an uncontrollable urge I\u2019m covered and don\u2019t have to worry about it kicking in. It\u2019s worked for me and a few of my friends.

Your wife got drunk at work and was stupid enough to get behind the wheel of a car. She could have killed someone, does she not get that?

She hasn't learned a thing, has she?", "NTA. She made poor choices and now has to live with the consequences.

She needs to adjust her expectations. Once things are better, she can upgrade,", "NTA. Consider: a scooter.", "NTA.  You get to get \"exactly what you want\" when you can pay cash.  She needs a few years of steady work and no car crashing before she sets her sights high.", "I think it's time you take control and put your foot down.", "NTA. A new car is over your budget and it's ridiculous to pull so much from savings just for a car when she's not contributing as much as you. Can't a compromise be made for a cheaper 2nd hand and doing the blackout or chrome erase at an auto shop?", "NTA.  IMO, she needs to learn some responsibility and practicality.   Through no fault of my own, my car was destroyed by the trees in my yard that fell on it during a tornado.  It was the only brand new car I ever had & I just paid it off 5 mo prior, it was in perfect shape with low miles & fully insured.  With the economy, inflation & supply chain issues, I decided that not spending 35,000 on a new car taking up the entire payout + getting into car payment again wasn\u2019t a good idea at this time so for now, I bought a used \u201809 Toyota Camry in pretty good shape from an individual owner hoping in a few years, things may improve.  I didn\u2019t have a sports car or anything but a \u201814 Altima SL with all the bells/whistles. I do miss my Altima, especially the stereo/aux system & the heated leather seats right now but  I just needed reliable transportation with good gas mileage & this car has fit that.  You have to be practical sometimes, especially when your actions are the reasons you no longer have your dream car.  \nYour last statement about she needs more self awareness in entirety & lowering her standards a bit is very true.  Plus the fact that the insurance rates per month with a DUI could be more than a car payment itself.", "NTA. I actually think a 2010 200K car (not a Celica, bleh, haha) is exactly the ticket right now. She doesn\u2019t have a car because she buggered her last one under the influence.

I must say it's even better than anything I was thinking. Putting the ball on her court is a sign of trust and it also makes the responsibilities more tangible.
