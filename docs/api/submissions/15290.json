{"id": 15290, "submission_id": "12tf772", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my MIL in front of everyone, after she kept trying to basically give my husbands dog away?", "selftext": "My husband got a dog 2 years ago. I'm not going to lie to y'all and say I want the dog because I don't and never did but I would NEVER tell my husband to get rid of his companion. I have my cats, he has his dog and this is just the way of life. I'm not a dog person and he isn't a cat person but all of our pets are well loved and taken care of. \n\nSince we got the dog 2 years ago my MIL has been weird about it. I'm actually not understanding what is going through her head because on one hand she absolutely loves the dog and likes taking her for weekend visits like she would a grandchild but on the other hand, she keeps trying to basically make deals with people she knows to give the dog away. Like she will call my husband and be like \"This woman I work with just had her dog pass away from old age and she absolutely adores Lulu. She has a big yard and it would be great for Lulu there.\" (We live on a farm- space is not an issue). Or \"Hey hunny, so I was just talking to Rachel at the Laundromat and she's looking for a dog for her daughter that just graduated and she just loves miss Lulu and they get along really well.\" Little comments like that at least once a week and it's honestly becoming frustrating. My husband has voiced to me several times that he doesn't understand why his mom keeps trying to get us to give the dog away and I truly don't get it either. How can you love a dog so much that you practically beg to take her on weekends and then try getting us to give her away all in one breath? We have told her several times we are not giving away our dog. We are not rehoming our dog. She needs to stop giving people hope that we will. All she says is \"Okay hunny, I was just trying to be helpful.\" Whatever that means.\n\nSo we were invited to her BBQ yesterday and she had a bunch of her work friends over and some family. The woman \"Rachel\" I mentioned above was there and she was absolutely cooing over our dog, which was fine. But then MIL said \"See what I mean hunny? They love each other so much and they would be a great fit.\" I didn't raise my voice or anything but I said \"Why do you keep doing that? We aren't getting rid of our dog. Stop trying to push for it constantly.\" She kind of just went quiet the rest of the time we were there honestly. My husband is on my side here, obviously, but my BIL texted us and said we should apologize because MIL was just trying to be helpful and doesn't really understand social cues (brain injury years ago apparently that I honestly didn't know about). AITA?\n\nETA: as a few have mentioned dementia (possibly), I do want to state that I have raised that point. I work in dementia care and for the past year she has been exhibiting early onset. She's only 63. But yes, I have raised the issue and my husband has brought it up with his mom and she ultimately has chalked it up to old age and says she is fine and won't be tested.", "created_utc": 1682024869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tf772/aita_for_embarrassing_my_mil_in_front_of_everyone/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn't be letting anyone have any alone time with my dog after constantly trying to give it to other people.\n\nThat being said, it might be time for MIL to be seen by a doctor. If she had a brain injury years ago something could be affecting her. Or maybe she's showing early signs of dementia or alzheimers. People with that can get confused and obsessed with certain ideas (i.e their partner is having an affair, one child said this, one person did something else, etc).", "NAH predicated on the brain injury. You did nothing wrong by speaking up, and you didn't know about her brain injury. It is weird that your husband never mentioned it if it's affecting her behavior.", "That's freaking weird \ud83d\ude02. I think you where as polite as you could be against someone who wants to give away your dog, so absolutely NTA", "**NTA** \\- You didn't know about the brain injury.  As you were writing the story, I was thinking it was some kind of dementia.  But having gone through that with two parents, I sort of know what to key on.  So, assuming that she did not have a brain injury, then her actions were out of line.  You didn't yell or call her names.  You just stated that you were irritated with her pushing your boundary.  You handled it well.  In the future, now that you know, I am sure that you will handle it differently.", "NTA, but just curious, do you have kids? Is MIL operating under some kind of delusion that parenting Lulu is causing you to put off giving her grandbabies?", "NTA.  That is fucking weird.  The only explanation I can come up with besides dementia is that she wants a grandchild and thinks taking away the dog will get her one sooner.", "NTA. \n\nYou kept telling her over and over again you aren't trying to rehome his dog but she keeps pestering, a lot. Seems like you need to take a more assertive stance for her to grasp the concept of you wanting you keep your pet.", "NTA.\n\n>my BIL texted us and said we should apologize because MIL was just trying to be helpful\n\nThis wasn't helpful in any way and she's been told that repeatedly.", "NTA, obviously.  Who constantly tries to rehome someone else\u2019s dog?  \ud83d\ude06 \n\nBut it sounds like the BIL is just trying to smooth things over.  Sometimes we all have to take one for the team to keep the peace in families.  Maybe say \u201cI\u2019m sorry if what I said made you uncomfortable, I know you love us and want to help.\u201d  Or something that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re to blame, but you want to put this all behind you.", "NTA. She's not listening.  You were totally fine in what you said.  Ask her how she's helping when you've stated repeatedly you DON'T want to give the dog away.", "NTA-My adorable brother in law completely misses social cues but even he understands when told no to something over and over. Your BIL is acting like an enabler and is completely wrong here. She knows what no means she\u2019s just hoping to turn it into a yes with enough nagging. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let her take the dog anywhere because it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d get Lulu back.", "You should only.have to say once that you don't want to get rid of your dog (If at all). What did they expect?? For you to go along in front of Rachel and give her false hopes that she's gonna get your dog? No you do exactly what you did.

Best wishes :)", "NTA and you guys know it's no longer safe to let her take that dog anywhere, right?", "Yeah honestly having worked in elder care homes, my first thought is cognitive degeneration. If that's the case I have to say NAH\n\nShe may not even realize she's doing this, or why it could be problematic. However there really isn't anything wrong with you having asked her about it. \n\nIt is probably time to sit down with the family, and discuss screening, and potentially plans for ongoing accommodations, and establishing a standard of how you respond when she shows signs of confusion.", "NTA you didn't know about the brain injury so for all you knew your MIL just was being malicious.", "NTA. \n\nI know there is mention of a brain injury/dementia... and I know this is a huuuuuge stretch.... and I wouldn't ask this if I hadn't actually had a friend's mother think this... but, I had a friend who's mother 100% believed that her daughter was channeling all of her mothering instincts into her dog and if the mother could just figure out how to make her daugher get rid of the dog, her daughter would wake-up, realize she wanted kids and start popping out grandkids. It was very weird.\n\nEven w/ the brain injury/dementia angle, she must be making some sort of weird association w/ the dog and have a reason for wanting to give it away. Could be a million different things, but there is some nugget in there that makes her think this is the right thing to do.", "Stop letting her take the dog for weekend visits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been telling him she needs to be checked despite her being as young as she is (63). Like for example, she keeps commenting on my wedding ring and says she's so glad I finally got it back.

Eventually it got worse, and she went into a care home.\n\nNext part spoilered for pet death.\n\n>!I would caution you that this woman's obsession went to the point she started trying to get the animals she found euthanized because she was convinced they were her pet that she needed to find a home for or have put down. She had her own dog put to sleep, and tried with other pets she got hold of, and it was this behaviour that finally made her family put her in a care home. !<"]}
