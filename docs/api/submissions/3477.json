I have a sister Lilly f19 who is a cis woman. We're both currently in college.\n\nGrowing up, I constantly compared myself to Lilly, especially since she was cis and I wasn't. She was always a straight-A student while I struggled to get Ds and Bs and maybe the occasional A. She was also pretty athletic, so she always had that perfect hourglass body. She also always had boys bowing down at her feet, especially since she was basically friends with the whole school.\n\nWhile I, on the other hand, never had boys swooning over me and didn't have as many friends as she did.\n\nNow onto the problem.\n\nLilly and I both go to the same community college. Even though with her she could have her pick at any college, she chose community college, which I find quite stupid. Now I like this guy named Jayden. He's really handsome and is a part of our school's basketball team. Jayden is the brother of a girl in our class, which is how we met. And I instantly fell in love with him.\n\nBut my dreams were crushed when I asked him out and he turned me down saying he was currently seeing one of Lilly friend's that she set him up with. When I heard this I was pretty mad at Lilly especially since she knew that I liked him.\n\nSo two days ago we were all having dinner together (me, Lilly, and our parents). We were all eating dinner when Lilly said she had something to tell us. She then told us that she had gotten a job at a company.\n\nMy parents were pretty excited for her telling her how proud they were of her. Now at this point, I was getting kind of annoyed, so I said that it must've been her pretty privilege that got her the job. Then everyone went silent and then my mom asked how I could say something like that to my sister and I just replied that it was true and the only reason she got her job was probably that she was pretty.\n\nThen Lilly got up and left and hasn't been speaking to me since so AITA?", "created_utc": 1669691140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7hjik/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_has_pretty/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How about try to grow up and see things from a different vantage, one that is more positive. Then you might find yourself a more lovable person and have better life experience", "YTA and a bitter one at that.\n\nAnd your having a crush on someone doesn't give you exclusive rights to them. You can't call dibs on another human being.", "Yep, YTA.\n\nYou definitely told your sister, in front of your parents, that you don't think she could succeed on merit. Your straight-A sister.

I think everyone can understand that feeling of wishing to be more like someone else- prettier, stronger, taller, thinner. \n\nBut you\u2019ve let your envy of Lilly grow inside you like a cancer. You\u2019ve said she was a straight a student - that has nothing to do with her looks, but likely helped her get the job. And Lilly can\u2019t help being beautiful - most of us don\u2019t get a say in our genes. \n\nBut - the qualities that make a human truly attractive are more than just looks: kindness, hard work, empathy, humor. Ask yourself carefully - are you being the best, most attractive version of yourself? Or have you let your envy of Lilly turn you into someone unpleasant and covetous?\n\nEdit: Aw! Thanks for the awards, lovely people!", "YTA \n\nYou even say yourself that she is a straight A student and you get Ds and Bs.

You are jealous of your sister. You need to do some serious work on yourself.", "Ah, yes. Being pretty obviously is why she did well in school. /s\n\nGrow up, YTA. Stop being jealous and focus on yourself. Living with resentment over who was prettier or smarter in high school is not the way.", "YTA. Lilly really didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If the guy didn\u2019t like the other girl he would not be dating her. You just sound bitter and spiteful. It\u2019s really sad that it\u2019s keeping you from being happy for your sister. I hope you can find a way to stop blaming her for the things in your life that are making you unhappy.", "YTA. So, you downplayed her hard work out of jealousy? Yep, definitely an AH move.

I understand that you\u2019re lashing out because you feel hurt and insecure but please, don\u2019t be that woman that tears other women down over boys. You undermined her entire worth because your feelings are hurt about a boy you liked. It\u2019s not a good look. You should definitely apologize and communicate your feelings with her in a healthy way. Hopefully you two can move on from this and do better in the future. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "YTA: So much of this speaks of your own bitterness and anger, not at all to do wih Lilly- whose only crime seems to be \"existence\", when all is said and done. Lilly has no responsibility to you- she can go to college where she wants, it's not your call. She can help her friends date if they've expressed interest in one another, it's not your call. She can get a job if she wants, and it has nothing to do with any sort of privilege- life is hard enough without your bitterness making it worse for your sister.", "YTA. There\u2019s research that attractive people make more money and have more opportunities for career advancement. But assuming that everything good that happens to your sister is because of looks and throwing it in her face is a cheap shot. Be better.

I don't know your life or what you've been struggling through or what your family dynamic is but mostly this sounds like jealousy. I am sure the struggle is harder for you, but as someone who was a sad asshole with no friends for a while, a lot of it had to do with my attitude and what I was or was not doing, nothing to do with anyone else.", "You sound bitter and envious of your sister. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nTelling anyone they only got the job because they\u2019re pretty is rude and degrading at the very least.\n\nBeing a trans woman is very hard, I sympathize with your struggles as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. It must be feel very unfair that Lily was \u201cborn with\u201d everything you\u2019ve wanted. But she didn\u2019t have a say in the matter just like you didn\u2019t. \n\nWhat you\u2019ve written and how you\u2019ve responded indicates a lot of envy and resentment that you unfairly turn on your sister as she is the easiest target. I urge you to speak to a counselor or therapist about how to express and address these feelings so they don\u2019t eat you alive and so you don\u2019t burn bridges in your other relationships.\n\nIn short, you were rude and cruel to say your sister only got a job because she\u2019s pretty. Being a trans woman is incredibly hard but the attitude you\u2019re displaying to your sister is going to color any friendships or relationships you have with other women, and your behavior is likely pushing away people. Emotions and feelings are always valid but our reactions are not. In this case, your response was most definitely not. How would you feel if you got a job you were proud of and your sister said you only got it because you\u2019re a diversity hire?", "Yes. YTA, I can\u2019t pretend to understand any of the struggles that you have faced. But being Trans does not give you the right to be rude and or mean because of your jealousy.", "YTA. That was a cruel thing to say. You basically just told her you don\u2019t think she can succeed on her own merits, even though you have to know that\u2019s not true. She\u2019s obviously smart (she got straight As) and charismatic (has a lot of friends). And she\u2019s an athlete (or at least athletic, whether or not she\u2019s on a team). She works hard. You, on the other hand, spend all your time comparing yourself to her and you sound very jealous (I saw a comment where you said you aren\u2019t but I don\u2019t believe that for a second and I doubt anyone else does either). Try being supportive instead of calling her stupid for going to community college (with the cost of 4-year colleges, that\u2019s actually a good move) and saying she only got a job because she\u2019s pretty.", "Yta, stop being jealous, life is unfair, deal with it", "YTA what a hater.", "YTA - It is your own problem to deal with your jealousy, not hers.", "YTA and you sound incredibly entitled.", "Yta. I hate people you get stuck on \"pretty privilege\" It gets you a free drink and sometimes people are nicer to you. It doesn't map out A's on a report card.\n\nAlso going to community college is smart af because it's cheaper. Plenty of people go to community colleges to get general education out of th way.", "YTA. That's a cruel and misogynistic thing to say to your sister. Doesn't even sound like she ever actually has done anything bad or mean to you, you're just extremely jealous of her. While what you've gone through in life as the result of not being cis has been very difficult, it does not give you the right to treat someone so poorly. I feel it's likely you're probably already in therapy, if not please consider it, you should raise these issues you have with your sister with your therapist. Being close sisters can be a beautiful, positive thing and I'm sure you want that for you both. I hope you apologise to your sister and express that the reason you lashed out was over hurt feelings about this boy and has nothing to do with her job.

What's that?\n\nI was literally told \"Sorry, we're not going to hire you as we can't have any issues between the male staff members and your husband and honestly, you're too pretty for a packhouse anyway.\" when interviewing to pack apples. I was eventually hired at a bar to \"bring sexy back\" (exact words from my boss) and then spent every night for 6 months being sexually harassed by men and called a bitch if I told them I was taken. \n\nI don't know about that pretty privilege bullshit... I lost out on a job opportunity because of it so it didn't feel like a privilege.. \n\nBeing attractive isn't all its cracked up to be. My life has mostly been full of unwanted harassment, being called jailbait as a child, comments about me \"asking for it\" for literally wearing JEANS and having friends completely ditch me over jealousy issues and having my intelligence and actual existence as a human being completely ignored because apparently im just something to look at. \n\nWhen I was a kid I would've done anything to blend in. Apologize to your sister. There's no need to treat family unkindly because of the way you feel. I'm serious about the therapy, you don't want to lose every female in your life because you can't stop being jealous of them for being female.", "YTA you are allowing yourself to live in your sisters supposed shadow.  You claim going to a community college is stupid.  Well it isn't and it's insulting to everyone on reddit who is going to community college as I am.  You go to Community College because it is DUMB to get your generals finished at a University and be in debt.\n\nHow did your sister even know you \"fell in love\" with Jayden?  Did you ever tell her?  You two are probably running with different crowds so it was probably not done to spite you.  You don't \"fall in love\" just by watching someone.  You fall in love by getting to know someone and seeingg who they are as a person.  You loved him on a super ficial shallow asthetic level.  \n\nShe only got the job because she is pretty?  Maybe she interviewed well.  You didn't state what the job is what her qualifications are.  Girl you are wallowing in self pitty.  I lived in my brothers shadow all through grade school.  I was the shy picked on kid that wore a brace under my clothes for scholiosis.  I had no friends.  My brother ran with the cool kids and went to all the parties.   I stopped living in his shadow when I became comfortable with myself got my own crowd and my own accomplishments.  You should try stepping out from your sister just for a moment and see how it feels.  You might kind of like it.", "Ohhh that was a petty petty petty response. YTA because instead of dealing with your own feelings, you\u2019re lashing out at her in retaliation. I get why you feel some type of way about your sister setting J up with someone else, but at the end of the day, J obviously was interested in that other person. Your sister probably deserves an apology in this situation.", "YTA.

You sound like a terrible, entitled person.", "YTA, but with empathy. \n\nI get that you are trans. I also have a feeling that, even possibly subconsciously, your dysphoria has caused a massive amount of jealousy towards your sister. A lot of what you seem to be jealous about has to do with her being cis, and I think you compare because you don't feel \"womanly\" compared to her. However, just because you are not cis does not make you any less of a woman or any less worthy of love. \n\nYour attitude, though, is probably why people don't gravitate to you. Your grades could be better, but that's on you, not her. One guy didn't like you, so find someone who embraces all of who you are. You need to learn to love yourself, and the light that radiates will attract people to you like a moth to a flame.", "YTA and a jealous miserable person", "YTA \n\nTry to work on your jealously. Your sister earned her accomplishments", "You just got finished saying that your sister maintains good grades and is friendly.\nI think a strong work ethic and good people skills could be very useful in landing a job.

Your sister had good grades, good relationships with her peers, and good financial decision making skills. You have described yourself as a D student that has always been jealous of your sister (and unfairly compared to her). You then reduced her accomplishments to the worth of her body which is a dangerous and disgusting thing to do. \n\nFirstly, saying that your STRAIGHT A STUDENT and SISTER only got a job because of her good looks is your internalized misogyny speaking. You crave attention (and you crave the male gaze) which makes you want to drag down other women to give yourself a better shot. New flash, it won\u2019t work. Second new flash, if she got a job because of her looks you should be concerned for her well being not spiteful and jealous. Third new flash, if your sister gets a job that she not fully qualified for guess what? You congratulate her anyways!! Because women are often ignored in comparison to their male peers when being considered for jobs !! So be glad she succeeded! You scoffing are her success shows how extremely bitter and angry you are at your sister. Let me save you some time and therapy by telling you that this is completely misdirected. You have not said one things about your sister hurting you in any way. Only her setting her friend up with a guy your WERE NOT with. And if you were upset by that you should\u2019ve talked to her about it! \n\nSecondly, you have commented about being ignored and not having friends due to be trans. As a queer person myself I know how hard this can be and how hard high school can be. But you\u2019re in college now! There are plenty of people that would be happy to be friends with Trans people. Go out and try to locate the lgbt community in your area. I\u2019m my experience living in small and large cities there is always a community for you. If you\u2019re having trouble making any friends at all you need to take some time and look inward. Most likely you are consistently blaming all your issues on everything EXCEPT yourself and that\u2019s the reason people don\u2019t want to be around you. Take some responsibility for being an AH. Practice apologizing. Make friends with your sister and let her introduce you to people and help you in school. It doesn\u2019t have to be you against the world. \n\nThirdly, I\u2019m just going to assume you\u2019re white because you seem like it and say this. Most of the white LGBT people I\u2019ve met have been the most miserable \u201cwoe is me\u201d people ever. They are a nightmare to be around and try to relate to people by comparing oppression. Don\u2019t be that person. As a black queer person that\u2019s been through everything you\u2019ve been through x10 I\u2019m gonna tell ya that that\u2019s your issue. Get over yourself and apologize to your sister! Oh also I have a sister who has ALWAYS outshined me and is my younger sister to boot.

I have a sister Lilly f19 who is a cis woman. We're both currently in college.\n\nGrowing up, I constantly compared myself to Lilly, especially since she was cis and I wasn't. She was always a straight-A student while I struggled to get Ds and Bs and maybe the occasional A. She was also pretty athletic, so she always had that perfect hourglass body. She also always had boys bowing down at her feet, especially since she was basically friends with the whole school.\n\nWhile I, on the other hand, never had boys swooning over me and didn't have as many friends as she did.\n\nNow onto the problem.\n\nLilly and I both go to the same community college. Even though with her she could have her pick at any college, she chose community college, which I find quite stupid. Now I like this guy named Jayden. He's really handsome and is a part of our school's basketball team. Jayden is the brother of a girl in our class, which is how we met. And I instantly fell in love with him.\n\nBut my dreams were crushed when I asked him out and he turned me down saying he was currently seeing one of Lilly friend's that she set him up with. When I heard this I was pretty mad at Lilly especially since she knew that I liked him.\n\nSo two days ago we were all having dinner together (me, Lilly, and our parents). We were all eating dinner when Lilly said she had something to tell us. She then told us that she had gotten a job at a company.\n\nMy parents were pretty excited for her telling her how proud they were of her. Now at this point, I was getting kind of annoyed, so I said that it must've been her pretty privilege that got her the job. Then everyone went silent and then my mom asked how I could say something like that to my sister and I just replied that it was true and the only reason she got her job was probably that she was pretty.\n\nThen Lilly got up and left and hasn't been speaking to me since so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Which is pretty much what you told your sister. She can be pretty AND have gotten her job because of her qualifications. Those aren't mutually exclusive. \n\nAnd it seems like at least some of this is coming from your feelings towards her setting Jayden up with someone else when she knew you liked him. That's a legitimate thing to feel hurt about. But saying,  \"hey, I felt really hurt when you did that. Can we talk about it?\" would have been a better way to express that than to attack her for something unrelated.

I feel for you OP - Its not a good feeling comparing yourself to your sister through adolescence and felt she had it better, and I also feel compassion that the conventional cis beauty standards in our society were behind it. They can be harsh. Maybe you were just too young to understand so far, and thats okay, but now you\u2019re older and you need to be more mature. Making that pretty privilege comment was you lashing out, you didn\u2019t even know in reality if she aced her interview, and was perhaps deserving of the job. You let pent up anger boil up over something you should have been proud of your sister for. Even if you felt your sister betrayed you by setting up Jayden knowing you liked him, the right thing to do was express this feeling of hurt to Lily and tell her you expected her loyalty over the friend she set up. At least from this post apart from the Jayden thing I didn\u2019t catch Lily being hostile towards you to give anymore reason to lash out. If there is more to the story, I can rethink but right now, as much as I feel for you, this is bad and you should make amends. Perhaps have a heart to heart with Lily, say sorry, and be upfront about your issues if you trust her to understand. If you don\u2019t, therapy is a great option and should help.

That would just be blatantly untrue. That being said, maybe it's because you come across as insecure and bitter (atleast based on your post) that people don't want to be around you.", "I come from a very republican area of norcal, and every trans woman I know has more friends than they can handle. I think you need to work on bettering yourself instead of tearing down your sister with buzz words. That was very hurtful and she likely had no idea why you said that, just that you intentionally hurt her feelings.", "More likely they didn't want to deal with your personality.", "No. It's because you're carrying a chip on your shoulder and hating people for being who they are.\n\nYou are reducing \"beautiful\" people to just their bodies - their minds, their kindness, their friendliness mean nothing to you. All you see are bodies to judge, and THAT will not make people want to be friends with you.\n\nPlease listen to everyone here. We see the jealousy, the envy, the bitterness.

I ask because where I live is pretty decent, but start driving a little ways and it gets bad. A lot of blatant discrimination against, well, every marginalized population. And I see how that takes a toll on people so I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s where you\u2019re coming from. If so, you might consider moving to an area where you can be free to be yourself without overwhelming discrimination. I really wish I could give you a hug. I feel like you need it. Don\u2019t misunderstand, you were 100% wrong with what you said to your sister. But I see you coming from a place of so much pain and my heart hurts for you.", "I'm friends with multiple trans people (both transfeminine and transmasculine). Some of my trans mates are very social and have a wide circle of friends. Others only have a few closer friends.\n\nA lot of things can be harder if you're queer, especially trans.

I really think you should seek out therapy because the way you're thinking & behaving isn't good. Being pretty & someone's son having a crush on her doesn't mean that's why she got the job also.

Your sister had every right to walk away from you. I understand jealousy but this has gone too far. You cannot blame every single achievement that she has on the fact that she\u2019s pretty and you deep down feel like you\u2019re not, I mean she\u2019s even more athletic and more studious.
