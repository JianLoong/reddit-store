Please excuse any errors. \n\n\nI (23F) live in a bungalow with my mom (58F), older sister (35F), brother-in-law (38M), and my niece and nephew (3F and 9M). My mom lives upstairs, while the rest of us live downstairs. I pay rent to my mom for my bedroom and the bathroom and kitchen space I share with my sister's family. Occasionally, my partner (23F) will also come over and spend a night with me in my room. Because it's a loud and packed house, those of us downstairs use noise makers to sleep. This helps me avoid getting woken up by my niece and nephew in the morning, and it likewise helps my sister sleep through if I'm ever up later in the night. I'm a graduate student, so my work hours are a bit more flexible than others in the house. \n\n\nNow here's what has recently become contentious: when my partner stays over, and we don't have to be up early the next day, we will often stay up late whispering. We're both night owls and are often up later than anyone in the house. My mom, whose room is right above mine, is a very light sleeper. She will often message telling us to be quiet; mind you, we are very intentional already about keeping our voices down. My sister, who I share a wall with, doesn't hear us. We are not being loud. My issue is that out of everyone in the house, my mom is the only one who opts not to use a noise maker, fan, or any other method to control how much noise gets to her in her room. \n\n\nYesterday this all came to a head. My partner stayed over earlier this week, and yesterday my mom sat me down and told me that if I wanted to live under her roof, she didn't want to hear my partner and I talking at night anymore. I pointed out that a) I pay to live here, and should have control over my space; b) my partner stays over maybe once or twice a month, maximum, and c) mom hasn't taken any steps to control noise to help improve her sleep, while the rest of us have. She said that she can't use a noisemaker and won't be able to sleep with one. Her point was that since my partner and I are the ones on a different schedule, we should be the ones making concessions. I asked her what she wanted us to do, and she said we could write to each other instead of speaking out loud. I refused and told her that we were already taking steps to be considerate by keeping our volume down, but that she can't police how and when I talk to my partner in the space I'm renting. She gave me the cold shoulder and we haven't talked since the argument.

Definitely feels like she doesn\u2019t feel she can say what the real problem is so she is substituting the whispering in place of her other objections. Only other thought would be that you share a vent or air return with her so the sound is traveling more directly to her room and not through the floor.", "Sounds more like she may have a problem with your significant other staying the night to me. I\u2019m not understanding how she\u2019s the only one hearing you, literally through the floor, whispering\u2026 NTA though as you pay for your space ! But you may wanna consider finding a new space for your own well-being.", "If you are only whispering, then NTA. Your mother must have super hearing! Are you sure there is nothing else going on, ie. she objects to his staying with you overnight? That she is \"moral policing\" you? It would probably be good to move out of that house altogether.", "At the end of the day, this is not a typical landlord-tenant situation.  You are living in your mom's house, even if you are paying some form of rent. That's going to be complicated until you can move out on your own. \n\nI would be looking for other living accommodations at his point.  If you can't afford it, then you are stuck with your Mom's rules.  Maybe you can go out at night and talk at a coffee bar or on your back porch.\n\nAll that said, I don't think your the AH. I don't think your Mom is, either. NAH.", "NTA - Could your mum put a rug down or something to insulate noise a bit more?

Good luck with this. Be happy and have a super day. :)", "NTA, that is a crazy rule to place on someone. Add to it the fact that you pay to live there, and it's just plain insane.\n\nI know that moving out may not be an option for you, so I'm hesitant to just say do that. But I would suggest you look into it. Your mother seems to be intent on continuing to treat you like a child whom she has control over.", "She wants you to WRITE to each other?!

OP agrees that they whisper. She can hear the whispering. Anyway, if y\u2019all want to talk just go outside or sit in the car or something", "NAH. Your mom has a right to sleep, and it is her house. At the same time, you do sound like you are trying your best to be as quiet as possible. But this is for you to resolve, not your mother.  \nAs I see it, you possibly have 5 options.   \n1. Get on a different schedule sleep schedule, so you don't have to whisper.   \n2. Have your partner stop sleeping over.  \n3. Text each other instead of speaking.  \n4. Move out.  \n5. Change your room to one that is not under or next to your mother, even if the room is smaller or you have to pay more rent.  \nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nYour mom can easily invest in a pair of earplugs, they are usually rated for 30-33 decibels (at least the ones that I usually find in a drugstore). Coincidentally, whispering clocks in at about 30dB!", "ESH. Move.", "Your mom is being unreasonable, especially if she hasn\u2019t even tried a white noise machine to see if it would help. However, unless you can afford to get your own place, I would try to find a reasonable alternative.\nCould you put your white noise making on while your partner is visiting? Or is there any way you could swap rooms with your sister so you are not directly below your mom, especially as you are on a different schedule from the rest of the household?", "NTA....you can't hear whispering through the floor. Mom is being ridiculous", "I would try having the radio or other sources of noise on when your partner is not staying with you.  If your mum doesn\u2019t complain about hearing anything, you will know that it is your partner that she objects to.  If this is the case, I would start looking for alternative accommodation x", "NAH your mum is not wrong for wanting to feel comfortable in her own house and to get good sleep. You may be whispering but she can clearly still hear you and it\u2019s disturbing her sleep. Yes you pay some form of rent but even rented accommodation comes with rules you need to stick to. One suggestion would be if your gf only stays once a month then could you stay at a hotel this one night? Personally I would just move out. I would however have a proper conversation with your mum to see if she has a bigger issue with your relationship than the noise, if she does then that\u2019s an entirely different matter and she would be AH.", "I feel like if she can hear you through the floor, you\u2019re not actually whispering. \n\nEither you, or your mom, is lying about the amount of noise being made.", "NTA, but it doesn't matter. Yes, your mom is being an unreasonable landlord, but it's her house, so not sure what your recourse could be. I live in a building where I can hear my upstairs neighbor cough, and I can not stand white noise or earplugs, so I kind of get it. But I deal bc those sounds are part of living in my multiunit building. Time for you to move. I wouldn't want to pay rent to be forced to pass notes after midnight.", "NTA, its your room, but not your house. This is not like a apartment situation where the tenant above is an asshole, this is yo mama. Maybe consider buying some foam for the ceiling that helps with noise reduction. If she still is complaining,  move out.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not your house and she doesn\u2019t have to let you live there.  If you don\u2019t like the living conditions, perhaps it\u2019s time to move out.", "I don\u2019t think either are AH here; I\u2019m one of those people who have to have it very quiet to sleep.  You may need to find your own place.", "NTA. Can you afford to move? If you're paying rent that is your space to do with as you want. Being courteous to your neighbors has a line. Some people don't know how to live in shared spaces.", "NTA. Stop whispering. Talk in a moderate tone. Tell your mother to use earplugs twice a month like an adult.", "NTA. Maybe start working towards moving out", "Move. NTA.", "NTA. Quit whispering and have loud sex instead. She'll beg you to stay up all night whispering", "Hey OP def NTA! \n\nJust something to consider though, this happened to my grandma, she was hearing whispers through her wall from the neighbours all night and complained about it for months. Turns out, it was the onset of dementia. Maybe get your mom checked out just to be safe!", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMove out.", "Are you suggesting that the mother is a bigot?", "This! \n\nI'm wondering how it's even possible to hear the noise from above you and not the room next to you.  Walls can be thin, but floors aren't.  Throw in carpeting and you shouldn't be able to hear a thing.  That doesn't make sense.  \n\nIt's like she knows your partner is there and is exaggerating being annoyed by the sounds you make.  \n\nSet her up to get proof.  Leave a radio or TV on or something with voices on very low so she cannot hear it from above.  Just something to make it seem like you're there when you're not.  Also volume should be set at a little lower than how you whisper to each other, no louder.   Leave that on all day.  At night, quietly leave and go stay somewhere else and wait for the texts.  If you don't get any texts, she might actually be telling the truth.  If you do get texts, you already know you're not there whispering, so tell her you went out with your partner because you wanted to chat and you're not even there.  Tell her to go check.  \n\nIf it is a legit issue, throw down a thick rug.  You can hang thicker fabric on the walls to dampen the sound.  Like extra curtains, etc.  If you can put stuff on the ceiling, do that too.  Like decorative a tapestry or something like that. That will help keep the sound in your room from escaping.  \n\nI got rid of my carpets and polished up the hardwood floors years ago when I lived in a row home (I think most call them townhomes).  My neighbor told me since I did that she could hear everything I did in the house.  The sound bounces around and amplifies without fabric or something else to dampen it.", "Thank you for your response! She genuinely is hearing whispering through the floor somehow, it's wild to me. But that's also a good point, my mom is overall neutral at best towards my lesbian-ness so that could definitely be playing a role.", "How is Op being shitty?", "I think that is exactly what they are suggesting.\n\nIf she is a bigot, I would not put past OP's mother if she was putting her ear to the floor to listen to them.\n\nNTA.", "In my mom's place, there are vents in the ceiling and floors for heat/air conditioning, that when open, can really make it sound like someone is right next to you when they're a floor above/below! I wonder if there's anything like that in OP's house?", "Try whispering a conversation to yourself a few nights when your partner isn't over to see if your mom tells you to quiet down.", "I\u2019m not commenting on the possible issue of your mom being bigoted but wanted to throw in that it could be the whispering itself. Whispering is often more disturbing to people than low talking is- it has to do with how far the sibilant sounds like s, x, ch, etc carry.", "There it is. Your mom's bigoted against people in same-sex couples. Sad, but not really surprising. NTA.", "I used to live in a college dorm where the radiator in my room extended to the room next door. Early on one night I heard rhythmic sounds of a voice going \"uh uh uh\" coming from the radiator clear as day.\n\nThe next day I left an anonymous note under the door of my neighbor advising to move their bed away from the radiator because sound travels very well through it. Didn't hear a peep from next door after that.", "Clever!", "Oh yes this. I hadn\u2019t thought of that but it\u2019s so true.", "I did giggle rather loudly at her suggestion at writing to each other instead of whispering. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but she is your landlord.  It most definitely is her house.  I suggest that you make different living arrangements.", "NTA", "Thank you! I think you're actually right on the money that it might even be both of these things. I have a vent on my ceiling so I think we do share one. At the same time, my mom is Roman Catholic and barely tolerates my queerness so honestly it would be weird if that weren't playing a part. At the very least I think she would find more patience if I were having a guy over. (Then again, maybe not, because she frowns on all sexual relationships before marriage lol)", "This also made me laugh!", "Haha I love this and a rug is a good idea! Maybe I can broker a ceasefire and ask about that lol", "Thank you, I'm inclined to agree...", "This made me chuckle because my mom also complains about the outside doors lol. It's six of one, half a dozen of the other.", "Lol you giggled too loudly to live in my room I bet", "Hey, thank you for your suggestions! We do have the white noise on whenever this is an issue- I put it on every night. My sister has a much bigger space that connects to the room her kids share, so switching definitely isn't possible. The only other room is upstairs next to my mom; I used to sleep in there and it's way worse. Very embarrassing, but I used to have something in there that I could pee in so I wouldn't wake her up going to the bathroom.", "Thank you! I commented this elsewhere, but I would say sometimes we're whisper-whispering, sometimes we're talking in very low voices. Never at full volume, we're always talking just loud enough to hear each other (and we're right beside each other in bed).", "I was wondering the same thing. In the UK a bungalow is on one level. There is no upstairs, there is no downstairs, there are no stairs.", "This might be a regional thing, sorry if my description wasn't clear! My house has a main floor that's on ground level (that's where my mom is) and a basement that's below ground level. Here we call any house with only one ground level (or above) floor a bungalow, even if it has a basement.", "Thank you, this is a great point. The double relationship definitely makes it complicated. I'm paying less here by a little (I would say maybe $100-$200 a month?) than I will have to if I find a different place, and I'm also close to my sister and we have a great relationship, so there are some benefits to staying. But it's getting to the point where the costs might outweigh that.", "Thank you! I often play music at night and she's never said anything about it, but I haven't tried it with something that actually sounds like talking.", "Thank you! I like the idea of a hotel but financially it would be a bit of a drag lol. I stay over at my partner's more often than she stays with me, and part of what's nice about is being at my house is that I don't need to pack up and be prepared to go someplace else. But I definitely see where you're coming from.", "I like this a lot, thank you! I'll experiment to get a better idea for what she hears. If I had to guess I'd say it's probably a bit of both: she probably does hear us sometimes, and she probably is looking for things to pick on too.", "It might be a fun experiment:\n\n\"Hey, honey. How are you?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm lying in your arms. What do you think?\"\n\n\"You have such nice penmanship.\"\n\n\"I would kiss you, but it might be too noisy.\"\n\nAnd then your mom gets mad because the pen on paper is SUPER loud.", "I do have a vent in my ceiling, so it's definitely possible that noise travels easier in my house. What's frustrating is that the rest of us just... deal with it?", "If it's the vent and you're not using it, just get a magnetic cover for the vent.  Maybe glue fabric on the back to see if that blocks the sound, might make it pretty, too. They're like a few bucks on Amazon.  It'll block the vent, but it'll block the sound, too.  Pops right on and off really easy.  If it works everyone wins and no one has to get butthurt after being called out.", "People can talk, play music, have a TV on and I\u2019ll sleep just fine. The moment whispering starts, I\u2019m wide awake and can\u2019t go back to sleep. \n\nIt took a long time to convince people to just talk normally and they didn\u2019t have to whisper to be considerate. I appreciated their efforts but it\u2019s like nails on a chalkboard to me.", "This is a good point! I think we're probably doing a bit of both, sometimes we try whispering whispering, sometimes we try talking in low voices. It doesn't seem to make a difference, I almost always get a text telling us to quiet down.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 My partner would get a kick out of this. We'd have to be careful not to make them too funny lest we accidentally laugh!", "Maybe start singing instead of whispering. \"I love you; you love me; we're a happy family...\"\n\nBut seriously, I saw a comment you made about urinating in something to not use the lavatory and wake her up. You gotta get out of there, no?"]}
