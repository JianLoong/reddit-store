But I do wanna say specific to your comment, child support is obviously based on the income of the parent who pays, not the parent receiving support. It's not a universal amount, nor is it guaranteed to cover the actual costs of raising the children. Often it's just barely enough to cover the cost increase between a 1 bedroom place and one with enough bedrooms for the kids. My father paid all the child support that was legally required, but it barely even covered 2 weeks of groceries with 4 mouths to feed. It certainly didn't cover the cost of clothes when we grew, or daycare after school, or gas to drive us to/from that daycare.\n\nSeptember was especially a time of financial stress. When my father could afford it he would take us for school supplies because my mom was barely making ends meet on a normal month. I think that would have been a great gesture, we're talking like 100$ going directly to nice things for the kids instead of straight into a college fund.

On top of that the kids already have a routine and stability as it is now, but let\u2019s ruin that for them and get 50/50 to avoid paying child support amirite?", "I\u2019ve worked in family court and mental health care. I can assure you most men don\u2019t. They never really parented the way mothers do with all the arrangements to be made and emotional labor it takes to run a household and rear children. After divorce they are typically fine seeing the kids every other weekend, because actually parenting and raising children is hard AF. Only exceptions are the full on really involved hands on fathers and the psychos who want to take the children just to spite their ex. There are very little men who, if the wife left on a four week trip and did not take the children with her, would know how to do everything their wives do in the household without her there to instruct them on every basic thing. The wife would probably come back to an absolute pig sty and neglected children. I\u2019ve heard a lot of divorced mothers say it\u2019s hard being a single mom but it\u2019s one less child to have to deal with \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Why do you think he agreed to let go of previous House and Car, Two consenting adults made a deal with its own advantages and disadvantages but one got better fortune to avoid repurcussinons after a few years.", "Why are y\u2019all pretending like all jobs are equal?", "So? Maybe their mum would like a job that involves travelling but can't because she has kids. There are lots of jobs that don't involve any travel so what you mean is you prefer travelling over your children. \n\nJust another crappy father expecting a parade for doing the bare minimum by his kids.", "So you can organise an arrangement with you ex", "My slip. I just kinda randomly picked your comment to comment upon the obvious. \ud83d\ude05", "Uh, I think a lot of people would think you want to spend as much time with your kids as possible, hence 50/50. There are (A lot) of situations where that isn't feasible due to schools or whatever but people are just going to assume that equal custody is desired.", "What's his plan to care for the kids if something happens to mom? Whatever that is, he should be doing that now rather than putting the bulk of the work to raise the kids on mom.", "Exactly! Doesn\u2019t SHE have the right to have a better job, too, and dedicate herself more to a career?", "Or just maybe because money doesn't grow on trees... \n\nNot everyone likes traveling for work. I did and it fucking sucked. But it does pay well. \n\nMaybe mom can make more so op doesn't have to travel and can be more involved with their life.", "So if the mom would like a job that prefers traveling, then takes the job so op has kids more are you going to say the same thing about her?", "Baloney. My wife travels a lot for work and, as such, if we split I would like wind up having my daughter more than her. That doesn't mean she doesn't love our daughter more than I do. Nor does it mean she loves her job/travel more than our daughter. It means the job she has is the best one for her AND us, and she'd be making a lot less (and be less happy about her job) if she had to switch.\n\nI work remotely and have turned away interviews for jobs that require going into the office... because then I wouldn't be able to be here for my daughter (because they would have me out of the house from 7-7 or so)... because my wife doesn't work from home (as much) and travels a lot. That doesn't mean I love my daughter more because I'm working a job that makes me the more frequent care-giver.", "Which is what they have done?", "Ah yes, causes exes who have just had their custody and child support modified are oh so willing to make voluntary accommodations for the dude who insisted and got a change in order saying he can do 50/50", "You do realize if he amasses wealth now and something happens he has the means to change up his life style right?", "Um... can't she go back and ask for 50/50 if she wants that, too? I just assumed she has the children more because she wanted/agreed she should have the children more.", "That's quite an assumption to make. By your logic, if OP just went for 50/50 custody he wouldn't need the extra money for child support anymore, so he wouldn't need the job with travel anymore. That argument kinda goes round in circles doesnt it?", "And back to the priorities mentioned in my first reply.\n\nMoney is money, you can always make more. Clearly he hasn't been 'amassing wealth', given the \"living with his grandma to make ends meet\".\n\nTime with your kids is something you don't get back. Why give that up for a job that clearly isn't even paying to provide them a substantially better life? I'm sure they'd rather have a dad that is interested, engaged and actively involved in their day to day life and upbringing.", "To have reduced child support his income should fall proportionally... Let's say he's paying 1000 while making 3000. If he makes 2000 he would have to pay like 666.66. He would have 2000 left over in the first case and 1333.33 in the second case. \n\nAlso, it comes with a reduction in the quality of life of the kids."]}
