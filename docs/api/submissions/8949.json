Your dad expects you to shower a dog who is going to bite you?  That\u2019s absolutely unreasonable.  Further, he regularly expects your mom to shower a dog who bites her?  \n\nDad is being neglectful of his dog.  First off, he needs to train the dog so it doesn\u2019t bite other people.  He also needs to take the dog to a groomer regularly to get a hygienic clip (basically have its rear shaved in a strip so that it doesn\u2019t make a mess of itself), so no one has to shower the dog regularly.  Next he needs to get the dog to the vet and figure out what\u2019s causing the frequent diarrhea and if possible, fix it - it could be as simple as a diet change or some anxiety medication.  If it is because of some underlying disorder and can\u2019t be fixed, he needs to arrange an easily cleanable space that will be the dog\u2019s main living area, or else take the dog outside often to get ahead of the problem, or both - but something so that a diarrhea-covered dog is not wandering the house, that\u2019s just unacceptable and gross.\n\nNext he needs to learn how to speak to his family with some modicum of courtesy and respect if he expects to have a family.

They're not bad people and not 100% neglectful, they just want to spare the dog the stress of training, eating other food etc. I had trained her while I was living with them, when she was like 3 or 4yo, but I've been away for 6 years and it all went to waste.
