I'll be calling her Brenda (32F). \n\nI've known and considered Brenda a friend for upward of a decade. Brenda recently got her degree in 3D art with the goal of working for a video game company.\n\nI own a staffing agency and have connections at Bungie, EA, Riot Games, and Twitch.\n\nWhen Brenda told me about her graduation, I offered to connect her to some recruiters within those companies to help her get her foot in the door. In this instance, I had no ulterior motive as the hiring wouldnt be through my agency, I was just connecting her to the recruiters within those companies.\n\nBrenda had sent me her resume and upon looking it over I let her know that her resume wouldn't make it past most Applicant Tracking System due to the format, and some missing info which would mark her as a low match % for the role. It wouldn't reject her, but her chances of getting in front as a high match candidate are low. She argued that the resume was built by someone who works in the field. I informed her that her resume is formated for a hiring manager in the field to look at and be impressed by, but if it doesn't make it to the hiring manager in the first place because of the ATS or a recruiter not seeing it, it is detrimental to her goal. Ultimately, she decided to stay with it. \n\nI set up an introductory video call on Wednesday with a recruiting manager(RM) at Bungie, and Brenda for last week. After the brief introductions, RM started to go over the interview and hiring process with Brenda in a very professional manner. After allowing him to talk for a minute, Brenda interrupted him and said \"I don't need you to mansplain anything. I need a job.\" the RM was visually taken aback. He had not said anything that would be even close go mansplaining. He said \"I'll have to get back to you. Thank you for taking the time to talk today.\" and dropped. The whole call lasted 7 minutes out of the 30 minutes scheduled. Before I could say anything, Brenda dropped from the call too. I was highly annoyed. RM called me a minute later and told me he's not going to move forward with Brenda for any role.\n\nI  decided to write off on helping Brenda all together after her stunt.\n\nThis is where I might be an asshole- She messaged me on FB yesterday asking about updates with Bungie. I told her she lost her chance with RM, and I'm done helping her if she's going to ignore professionals, and be an asshole to people trying to help her. While I wasn't mean about saying it, I also didn't approach it in a professional manner. She's told a few mutual friends who are saying I should give her another chance but I'm refusing to.\n\nSo am I being an Ahole by refusing to help someone?", "created_utc": 1669147097, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z238z8/aita_for_refusing_to_help_a_friend_anymore/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She could hurt your reputation. They may think if this is the person you personally recommend, then your judgment is skewed and they should avoid working with you and your agency.

You are essentially putting your professional ass on the line for her and she\u2019s acting like a child. You are in the industry and knows what it takes, she\u2019s the one ignoring your advice. Wash your hands of this situation for sure", "NTA\n\nYikes Brenda needs to understand that if she wants a job she needs to play the game. If she's going to get snippy with every male that explains something to her she's going to fail.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by not helping her. This behavior will reflect poorly on you professionally.", "You're her friend, not her parent.  You did what you felt comfortable doing to help her get a job.  You weren't even required to do that much.\n\nActions have consequences.  Sounds like she needs to learn this.\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA, she's burning professional bridges.   She's her own worst enemy.", "NTA, as a professional you have to protect your reputation with the people in the industry. If you put forward a candidate as a favor to a friend and they have a huge unprofessional outburst, it looks bad on you. They\u2019ve burned you once, you aren\u2019t an asshole by refusing to stick your hand back in the fire.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't obligated to give her the first chance. You have no obligation to help her get the second one.\n\nI would hesitate to help her myself, seeing that she's got a huge chip on her shoulder, is entitled and doesn't want to take advice from anyone. You have to realize, since you have connections at Bungie, her shitty attitude is going to sabotage those connections. The RM she insulted is probably wondering, \"What kind of asshole did \\[*OP*\\] connect me with?\"\n\nThen your own credibility at Bungie is questioned. And RMs are going to look at your recommendations in a prejudiced mindset. After this, you should only use your connections to help people who show a willingness to adjust and learn and who demonstrate a professional attitude. Brenda has shown none of this, nor is their any indication that she's learned from her mistakes.", "NTA. She could've hurt your reputation with that stunt. You did what you could. She clearly has some growing up to do.", "NTA people who keep self sabotaging are not your problem", "Lol.  No.  Do not give her another chance.  You went out on a limb to help a friend out and she was incredibly unprofessional.  Ghost her.  Lose her number.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Your friend was unprofessional and not only insulted the recruiter, she didn't care enough about your friendship in the process of doing so. She also didn't seem apologetic for her behavior. \n\nIf you help her again, what is to say she won't repeat the same thing again. She will burn your professional bridges. Let her go. Let you other friends know what she did and that they can help her if they want.", "NTA\n\nIsn't it detrimental to you as well? \n\nThese people trust you to connect them with adequate applicants, that they don't pick who you recommend because they find someone better is one thing but they might lose \"faith\" in you if you introduce to people like your \"friend\"", "NTA, you tried to give her guidance and open doors. She tossed the guidance and was promptly rude to a recruiter.  Shocker: not all men are trying to mansplain. He was trying to normal explain how their company works.  Don't risk your professional reputation again. She got her shot, she blew it, not you.", "NTA You literally tried your best and she ruined her chance on her own", "NTA. This is your profession and you can\u2019t be helping idiots at the risk of your professional reputation.

You did help, you offered professional advice, but Brenda knew best so she can sink or swim on her own.", "You are NTA and do not feel bad. YWBTA to yourself if you help her and it will look bad on you. This is your professional reputation at stake if you help her again. \n\nLet Brenda make an arse of herself.

You put your reputation and name on the line getting her in front of a RM and she embarrassed herself and you.", "NTA- you stuck your neck out for her and she burnt you. Why would you continue to help her?? Focus on making amends with the guy she attacked.", "Nta. \n\nBy putting your friend forward you're also putting your reputation on the line as well. Seriously the nerve of your friend to be rude, when it had the potential to impact you as well is enough of a reason to say no more favours.\n\nShe doesn't have to take your advice but she should make sure she is professional to your contacts.", "NTA. \"Mansplain\" is one of those words you don't use in a professional interview for a technical role. Your friend needs ... well, let's just be charitable here and say she needs a clue.", "NTA. You were trying to help a friend who didn\u2019t want to listen to constructive advice and was incredibly rude and unprofessional to one of your industry colleagues who was doing you a favor in taking the meeting. Helping a friend ends when they act unprofessionally and potentially damage your credibility.

The first problem was when trying to help her with her resume she blew you off.

I'm a guy, I'm as of now I think second most senior in my role in the office (unless someone else quit and I don't know yet), but if someone comes and tries to explain how something works, I listen.

If something breaks, or a junior asks and doesn't get it after my explanation, I can always go \"right, what if I approach it from that angle\" and so often problem solved immediately.", "How is that NAH?", "Exactly, if you stick your neck out for her again, you are directly associating her name with yours.
