Feel like I\u2019m going insane.", "selftext": "EDIT- She got rid of the dog because she decided to travel the world and didn\u2019t feel like she was able to care for the dog. She brings up often how she \u201cstruggles with her decision to travel and she misses her so much\u201d. \n\nEDIT 2- When I don\u2019t respond with pictures, she will gaslight me with \u201cmy daughter has been is in and out of the hospital for years and all she wants is pics of Cherie.\u201d Then gets annoyed with me saying it\u2019s her daughter that wants the pics when I know it\u2019s her. This woman is hot and cold. \n\nEDIT 3- I know\u2026I totally messed up by agreeing to a meet up that I never wanted to happen. I haven\u2019t blocked her yet because she seems like a powerful lady and could find me or send police after me if she wanted. She has my home address. My fear of her (and my own accountability for my decisions here) have been holding me back from handling this appropriately, but everyone\u2019s advice is really helpful to my situation.\n\nSo I (20f) adopted a precious 1yo French bulldog from someone (40-60?F) privately, not through an organization. She was a client at the board and train I worked at, and when I heard the dog needed a home I didn\u2019t hesitate. I agreed to let the old owner \u201csee her on occasion and send updates to keep her posted\u201d as the owner requested. I don\u2019t care for this woman to remain in my life or my dogs. In my mind this meant that I would send her updates once a month for the first few months and possibly let her see her once. I knew right off the bat it wouldn\u2019t be realistic for her to remain in contact but I figured I could get by with initial updates and maybe just one visit only because she\u2019s pushy and I didn\u2019t feel like I had an option. \nWell, she has been texting my every few days for two months now asking about the dog, if she needs anything, asking for pictures way too frequently, and asking me what products I\u2019m using on her skin and getting bothered if I don\u2019t use what she used to use. She usually asks for photos so often that I haven\u2019t even taken any new ones since the last time she asked. I let it slip that I was sick once and she texted me everyday after asking I was feeling better and making sure someone could take care of my dogs? Like she would take care of them if I had no one. If she had good intentions I did not appreciate it. Such a crossing of my personal space and boundaries. When I don\u2019t send her pictures she gets genuinely bothered with me. And then on good days she\u2019ll send me stupid frenchie memes that I\u2019m expected to love and respond to. Once I realized how bad it was I decided to only respond when necessary, and she hardly lets me get away with that. (Don\u2019t know if this helps but she is a crazy rich Asian type, full of plastic with more money than she knows what to do with) I don\u2019t think she has friends and I\u2019ve thought that she might just want ME to stay in her life as well as my new dog even though she\u2019s giving such mixed signals?? The time has come and she wants to meet up, but I don\u2019t think I can take it at this point, she\u2019s driving me insane and has made my life miserable in so many ways. Meeting up would make my life worse and only lead this crazy woman on. I have no idea how to tell her I want to without making myself enemy #1.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to meet up when I agreed to upon adoption?

There are many groups that charge money to give out 'papers' saying the animal is a service dog.

Guide dogs for the blind have their own set of records, dogs trained for hearing purposes have another set of records from that training organization.     \nThe only way people can prove their animal is a service dog is whatever prescription or note that their doctor gives them saying they need help with X, Y or Z condition.\n\nSince you do not have any of those conditions, your dog isn't really a service dog anymore as it does not perform any tasks/jobs.", "I think they mean you don\u2019t qualify to have the service animal papers because you don\u2019t qualify for the service animal.

She's already setting this up to be a case of you just boarding her dog so when she's tired of traveling she will just take the dog back. So you need to get her microchipped in your name.

She may not have been happy about it but she knew I took excellent care of my dog. I did keep in touch with her more often than once a year. We friended each other on Facebook and she saw tons of pics of us together. When we still lived close to each other I would let her dog sit when I went on vacation. I say this because you need to set boundaries. I would say you\u2019ll give bi-monthly updates until the end of the year and then yearly or as you see fit.", "Also, at least in the US, there is no such thing as registration for service animals through the ADA, and the kind you can buy online are basically meaningless with regards to legal protection.
