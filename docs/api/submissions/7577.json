Feel like I\u2019m going insane.", "selftext": "EDIT- She got rid of the dog because she decided to travel the world and didn\u2019t feel like she was able to care for the dog. She brings up often how she \u201cstruggles with her decision to travel and she misses her so much\u201d. \n\nEDIT 2- When I don\u2019t respond with pictures, she will gaslight me with \u201cmy daughter has been is in and out of the hospital for years and all she wants is pics of Cherie.\u201d Then gets annoyed with me saying it\u2019s her daughter that wants the pics when I know it\u2019s her. This woman is hot and cold. \n\nSo I (20f) adopted a precious 1yo french bulldog from someone (40-60?F) privately, not through an organization. She was a client at the board and train I worked at, and when I heard the dog needed a home I didn\u2019t hesitate. I agreed to let the old owner \u201csee her on occasion and send updates to keep her posted\u201d as the owner requested. I don\u2019t care for this woman to remain in my life or my dogs. In my mind this meant that I would send her updates once a month for the first few months and possibly let her see her once. I knew right off the bat it wouldn\u2019t be realistic for her to remain in contact but I figured I could get by with initial updates and maybe just one visit only because she\u2019s pushy and I didn\u2019t feel like I had an option. \nWell, she has been texting my every few days for two months now asking about the dog, if she needs anything, asking for pictures way too frequently, and asking me what products I\u2019m using on her skin and getting bothered if I don\u2019t use what she used to use. She usually asks for photos so often that I haven\u2019t even taken any new ones since the last time she asked. I let it slip that I was sick once and she texted me everyday after asking I was feeling better and making sure someone could take care of my dogs? Like she would take care of them if I had no one. If she had good intentions I did not appreciate it. Such a crossing of my personal space and boundaries. When I don\u2019t send her pictures she gets genuinely bothered with me. And then on good days she\u2019ll send me stupid frenchie memes that I\u2019m expected to love and respond to. Once I realized how bad it was I decided to only respond when necessary, and she hardly lets me get away with that. (Don\u2019t know if this helps but she is a crazy rich Asian type, full of plastic with more money than she knows what to do with) I don\u2019t think she has friends and I\u2019ve thought that she might just want ME to stay in her life as well as my new dog even though she\u2019s giving such mixed signals?? The time has come and she wants to meet up, but I don\u2019t think I can take it at this point, she\u2019s driving me insane and has made my life miserable in so many ways. Meeting up would make my life worse and only lead this crazy woman on. I have no idea how to tell her I want to without making myself enemy #1.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to meet up when I agreed to upon adoption? No papers were signed but her service animal papers are in my name.", "created_utc": 1673974892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eh91f/aita_dogs_old_owner_wont_stop_texting_me_feel/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Literally no reason to delay telling her.", "NTA- This is beyond an attachment disorder. I would either block her from everything, or simply return the dog and cut your loses.", "What do you have to lose by setting a hard boundary with her? Let her know her choices are, for example, A) one photo and brief update a month for the next 6 months then as you see fit if that works, or B) no contact whatsoever. \n\nThat\u2019s it, not negotiable.

But, you need to communicate with her that you're uncomfortable with her contacting you so much. Set some boundaries for yourself. If she doesn't stay within them, you'll have to cut her off (maybe by blocking her number). If she continues to harass you, you can ask for a restraining order. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.", "NTA!!

She gave up the dog.", "NTA - you\u2019re not dog sitting, that\u2019s your dog now. She had plenty of time to consider what she was doing.", "NTA  Start an Instagram account for the dog, take pictures and post on said Instagram, Link her the Instagram, She can look at it anytime she wants.

Block her number and move on. Get the cops involved if she won't stop harassing you.", "This is crossing boundaries on so many levels. If she only has your contact info, block her.

NTA and I hope things get better.", "NTA - she is invading your life and if she wanted to keep the dog she shouldn\u2019t have given it away. I do think you need to talk/meet with her once and say it\u2019s too much and she needs to back off, but in a nice way.", "INFO: what was the reason for her needing to get rid of the dog?", "NTA. Staying in touch is one thing. This is way over the line.", "NTA\n\nJust tell her that the pup might find it too confusing and that it might set her back from settling in. Maybe worth revisiting in 6 mos.\n\n\nAnd then tell her that you\u2019re really happy to have the pup as part of your family now and that you\u2019ll send pics periodically but that you need to reduce contact. \n\nStop responding.", "Nta. We\u2019ve been been on both sides of adoptions and this is odd behavior.

Imo this woman is one of two things.\nA) extremely guilty for abandoning the dog to go traveling and is trying to stay close to the dog so she doesnt feel bad.\n\nOr B) she basically wants to see a dog as hers, but cant be bothered to look after it.\n\nBig warning, I would stand your ground, because I could see her popping up a year or two down the line when the dog is older and easier to take care of and asking for it back.\n\nIf she ever says \" i used this product\" just say \"well ive been using this one because i think its better\" .

There's no reason as a 20 year old that you need to stay in constant contact with a middle-aged woman just because you informally adopted a dog from her.

The previous owner decided to travel the world without the service dog that she presumably needs, and could bring with her through most of the world?\n\n3.

I had a hard time understanding your comment. She doesn\u2019t need papers as a service dog?", "It is a weird story. Just looking for advice since it is a messy situation. This woman sent my NSAR certificate with my name on it but it just says \u201cpsychiatric service\u201d and I didn\u2019t get any other papers with info, just a signed certificate with the old owners approval. I thought that was the entire process because that\u2019s all the owner gave me, maybe she lied to me about the validity of me of her being in my name under NSAR.", "Imagine how many schmucks would fall for this.", "Firstly, there is no actual service dog registry.  There are many groups that charge money to give out 'papers' saying the animal is a service dog. But there is no official registry (in the USA), which is a big problem when people need to prove their dog is an actual service dog.  Guide dogs for the blind have their own set of records, dogs trained for hearing purposes have another set of records from that training organization.     \nThe only way people can prove their animal is a service dog is whatever prescription or note that their doctor gives them saying they need help with X, Y or Z condition.\n\nSince you do not have any of those conditions, your dog isn't really a service dog anymore as it does not perform any tasks/jobs.", "I think they mean you don\u2019t qualify to have the service animal papers because you don\u2019t qualify for the service animal. Like if you bought a car that had handicap tags from the prior owner you couldn\u2019t then keep the handicap tags because you don\u2019t qualify for them.

Please just do a slow fade and don\u2019t give her back to this person. The good thing about obsessives like this is that they often move onto a new obsession relatively quickly, in my experience.", "> NSAR \n\nNSAR is a scam. There's no such thing as \"service animal paperwork\" in the USA, and their certificates have no legal validity.\n\nNow it makes more sense.", "These dogs are usually trained along side the owner to alert them to some change in their condition and they wont/dont do that with any other people. Like PTSD or panic attacks, how they start can vary from person to person so the training wont transfer to a new person.", "Wow insane, okay great to know thank you.", "Can verify, I have lived with OCD most of my life, the obsession is likely to move on to another thing.", "Wow no shit. That changes things."]}
