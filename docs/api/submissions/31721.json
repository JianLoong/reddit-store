My sister and I have the same mother, her father had a son in a later marriage, and I showed up in my mother\u2019s third marriage. \nSo, when their dad and his wife both passed within days of each other, my sister was there immediately. I was there shortly after her as it was nearby and I wanted to be there for her. We were searching the house for a Will or Trust (none was found) and I found current financial statements for retirement accounts they each held separately. Together there was around $700k. Her other brother wasn\u2019t able to get there for a few days. I found out later that my sister withheld the information about the retirement accounts from him. They sold the house and split that 50/50 but he didn\u2019t know about the $700k, and she took all of it. I love my sister, but I find this to be despicable and I want to tell him. At the very least, his mother\u2019s money should have been 100% his. Also, given how she handled it, I suspect that there was a Will and she hid it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that when a friend of hers asked about how the estate would be handled, I mentioned the retirement funds and was promptly ask to not mention them again. Which I obviously found odd. \nAlso, if I\u2019m wrong, then he would already know about the money and that it was left to her, so no harm done.

Do you know for *certain* she\u2019s keeping money meant for him away from him?", "I'm having a hard time figuring out how she could have claimed the entire retirement account if she wasn't 100% the beneficiary.\n\nWere there two retirement accounts--one for the wife and one for the husband? Which one predeceased the other? Were the spouses the beneficiaries of the retirement accounts? Were the spouses the primary beneficiaries and the daughter the secondary beneficiary? Was the son a beneficiary at all?\n\nI don't think you have enough information to just assume your sister did anything wrong. If the brother wasn't a beneficiary on the retirement accounts the only way he'd be entitled to any of the money was if the surviving spouse was the beneficiary and then those assets became part of the estate. Which has to go through a probate court.\n\nOne reason you might have been asked to not mention the retirement accounts is because the sister/daughter was the sole beneficiary and didn't want her brother to feel bad about it.\n\nI would not tell the brother unless you have more proof than this he's entitled to something. I suppose you could dig up the probate court records. That ought to show what happend with the estate. But probably wouldn't show who was the beneficiary of the retirement account. However, if the son was a beneficiary on the retirement account, they wouldn't have given that money to your sister. And if the surviving spouse was a beneficiary of the spouse that predeceased, then it would have had to be probated.\n\nSo it comes down to YWBTA without figuring out first that your sister actually did anything wrong.", "NTA.

Your sister's father may have designated your sister as the sole beneficiary. If that's the case, they money rightfully belongs to your sister.

Pls tell him he deserves that money just as much as she does.", "YTA\n\nRetirement benefits have beneficiaries that are listed in the program.\n\nThey are typically not subject to probate; think of them more than likely like a life insurance policy than cash under a mattress.\n\nIf your sister got the money; the ONLY way she did it was if she was listed as the beneficiary.   The money would go to her and no one else.\n\nIf the parents had wanted any of the other kids to get it, they would have listed them as beneficiaries as well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If two individuals are entitled to equal distributions and one claims to be the only beneficiary, that's a big legal issue.\n\nSource: 401k administrator for 6+ years.", "This has to be the case because otherwise they would not distribute it to her.   There is a primary and a secondary designee.  And it would depend on who died first.   If step mom died first then dad gets her account and the will would apply.  It would not go to the secondary because he already inherited for example.  \n\nI found the story fishy because it seemed unlikely that anyone could easily access the 401ks.", "Not if she is the beneficiary to the retirement account. If so, then he has no right to the money in which case she may be trying to be kind so he doesn't worry about why his parents never listed him as beneficiary."]}
