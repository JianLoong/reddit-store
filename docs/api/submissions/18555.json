Don\u2019t listen to your friends.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t involve yourself at all.  You do not know what her father would do.  He would probably seek a lawyer to take you to court for child support and make life difficult by tracking your family down to hold you accountable.  You have no idea what will happen.  Don\u2019t start a lie.  She needs to stand up for herself and stop involving others.  \n\nIf her parents don\u2019t support her then she needs to find a way herself to support her and her child.  Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. She was irresponsible, got pregnant from a virtual stranger and decided to keep the baby. None of those actions are your fault.\n\nIf she doesn't have the financial ressources to have a baby, her solution shouldn't be to LIE to her own family so she could get their support and risk losing everything when her lie is uncovered.\n\nDon't get involved in that. They say it's a one-time thing : it clearly will not be. How does she plan to explain that the father is not there for the birth of the child ?!", "NTA. Her stepfather wants to nail someone for child support. I don\u2019t think you want to find yourself in any situation where you\u2019ll have to disprove paternity.", "I think you're right about \"this does not sound like the sort of lie you tell once\". This is the tip of the iceberg. Your friend may start bringing you to family dinners until she is \"ready to reveal\" she hasn't been in contact with the father, and before you know it, you may get sucked into a lie that consumes your life, and your emotional well-being.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - don't do it.  I can almost guarantee that her step-dad will corner you at some point to find out \"your intentions\" towards his daughter and grandchild, how you plan to support them, why you won't marry her, etc. etc. etc.\n\n**If she's old enough to decide that she wants to keep the baby, then she's old enough to be an adult and tell her family the truth** \\- namely that the baby is from a tinder date and the guy has blocked her completely.  In fact, if she just comes clean, it may be possible to have an attorney get involved to hold the real bio-dad accountable.\n\nBut don't do this.  It won't end up going well for anyone involved.", "NTA. \n\nIt will definitely not be something that you lie about it once and nothing happens after that.", "NTA, that\u2019s a completely ridiculous ask. Don\u2019t do this, if this is a legitimate situation the cat\u2019s going to be out of the bag at some point. Hopefully she can find the biodad and get child support. This sounds like a bad sitcom plot", "NTA, and this is a terrible idea. It won't just be for one day and she is being very emotionally manipulative.", "Oof, NTA. Especially considering that her family expects \"the father\" to help with expenses - aka you, who is not the father.\n\nYour friend has other options besides keeping the baby.", "NTA, run away! there is no way that this lie could put you anywhere but in a world of shit. The mom and stepdad want the father to step up and provide support, which is fair. They do not want to pay everything and the father skips away free. What were you going to say when they brought up support? When exactly was she planning on telling them the truth? Advise your friend to put her head down and tell the truth, then run far away from the whole mess.", "NTA\n\nThis is the kind of lie that will haunt you forever!   \nDo not go to that baby reveal *at any cost*. This is the basis of most psychodramas. You do not want to be the lead character in one of those!", "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, OP. BTW, we\u2019re going to set up a meeting with you, and our lawyer, to discuss the child support agreement and order between you and our daughter. Are you available next Friday?\u201d If that doesn\u2019t sound like a conversation you want to have, then stay far away from the situation. NTA", "NTA. Her family said they wanted the father involved in the babies life- not that they wanted the father to show up to the baby shower then never come around again. This will definitely turn into a more than one time thing. If you agree to pretend now, you\u2019re setting yourself up for lots of trouble later. At worse the family could try to seek child support from you. You could refuse with a paternity test, but why put yourself in that awkward position? They could also blow up your social media. Even if you believe your friend, you just don\u2019t know what her family will do. \n\nI sympathize with your friend, she\u2019s in a hard position, but this is far too much to ask of someone. She should reach out to a lawyer to get information on how to seek child support from the real father.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't father the child. You're not responsible for role-playing the father at any point.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds dicey & dubious and no one can blame you for not wanting to take that risk.\n\nThe situation isn't sustainable, your friend can't keep lying to the parents forever, though the parents are super shitty for what they're doing to her.\n\nShe will need to think of another solution that doesn't involve you taking a huge risk.", "NTA.  Let\u2019s fast forward.  Is she going to cry and beg you to sign the birth certificate?  And if you show up at the shower event as \u201cfather\u201d, you know her stepfather is going to sue for child support.  And yes, DNA testing will prove you\u2019re not the father, but still now you have lawyer and court expenses.  Oh, there\u2019s no guarantee a judge won\u2019t say you took on paternal responsibility so yeah, child support.  \n\nIf this was a woman you cared about and wanted to be the father, I could support that 100%.  But playing a game that can wreck your life, nah, don\u2019t play.  You can\u2019t win.", "NTA\n\nHer situation sucks, fersher-fersher, but regrettably, it's still HER situation. You can try to help, but pretending to be the father is going to drag you into the middle of her situation, and you don't want to be there.\n\nYou can support people, but you are not obligated to set your life on fire to keep someone else's embers warm. She will figure it out one way or another, but she dug her hole by lying in the first place.", "NTA. Don't volunteer yourself to be the lightning rod for her choice. There is no way this doesn't result in problems for you. Her family will expect stuff from you right up the point you tell them you just posed for her convenience. And then they might still pressure you to do stuff for her or give you shit for decieving them. Going along with this can easily ruin your life.", "NTA. This isn't your partner, your child, or your problem.", "NTA - THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM, DO NOT GET INVOLVED\n\nYour friend needs to come clean and her parents need to help her sue the actual father of the baby for child support OR be a single parent, as she has made that decision for herself.  I can understand why her parents WANT the baby's father to support the baby... but at the end of the day, her game is not in sync with their reasoning, and she doesn't get that.", "NTA that's a huge thing to ask you to lie about and just a terrible idea in general. I doubt it'd be a one time thing. Also has she considered how much of a hard time people (I.e. her parents) will give you at the baby shower if they think you're some deadbeat dad? I'd like to think that her parents won't really leave her high and dry and Will help her out regardless. It's her problem to sort out at the end of the day, you can be a supportive friend without getting dragged into any potential drama and messiness.", "NTA. This is her mess that she got herself into and now she's trying to drag you into it without caring how it might affect you. This will definitely not be a one time lie, just throwing that out there. So what, you show up and the stepfather pulls you aside to chat with you and you have to get grilled and come up with a bunch of lies on top of the original lie? No thanks! She said repeatedly she wouldn't ask you anymore, and that it was up to you, but here she is crying and begging and hounding you to do something you aren't comfortable with, which makes her kind of a bad friend. \n\nQuestion though. If she knows the dad but can't get a hold of him, can she not still go after him for child support??", "Don't do this. This is a ridiculous thing to ask of someone. And it's not going to be a one time lie either. If she's old enough to have sex and get pregnant, she should be adult enough to deal with the consequences of her actions. NTA.", "It we not be a one time thing. It doesn't matter what she says on that aspect, she's deluding herself and by extension you.\n\nYou are right that her parents could very well, if you \"disappear\", contact your friends and family to get them to make you stay involved. That isn't an unlikely scenario and would cause a lot of problems for you.\n\nNTA\n\nI understand she's desperate but this is not a reasonable thing to ask.", "\"... she guarantees it will be a one-time thing\"\n\nYou know it won't be though right?\n\nHer family would know you as the father. When you disappear and the girl is all set to become a single mother, are they just going to forget all about you?\n\nI understand that the poor girl is desperate and grasping at straws, but to drag you into what is a whopper of lie that **will** get found out is a truly terrible idea.\n\nThe other girls need to back the fuck off with the pressure too. \n\nDo not do this.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This sounds like the plot to \"A Walk In The Clouds\" except OP isn't Keanu Reeves and I don't think it will end as satisfying. Nope. Don't do it. Your friend was irresponsible and now she has to live with it. Sounds harsh, but that's the reality of the situation.", "NTA. No need to get involved in your friend\u2019s unfortunate situation. How long would you plan on keeping up the lie?", "NTA for helping out your friend, however be careful, depending on where you are in the world, taking on a \"fatherly\" role can be grounds for a court to assign you child support responsibilities.", "NTA. NO NO NO do not do this. Do not let yourself be manipulated in this way. She told a massive lie to her parents and she's trying to get you to cover for her lies. Her parents should cancel the genital reveal party and put that money to supporting her if they want to give her money.", "NTA, and please don't even consider doing this. Aside from all the family problems (on both sides) thus could cause, you could easily end up finding yourself financially responsible for a child who is not yours.", "Absolutely no good could come from that!", "NTA. Nothing good will come from this. This is the worst idea imaginable.", "NTA. Worst case scenario, this is step one down the slippery slope that puts your name on the birth certificate and gets you forced into child support. Sucks that your friend is in a tough position, but this ask is too much.", "NTA. Not the daddy. Don't make a mistake. Down the road if not sooner that can come back and bite.", "> One of the stipulations that her stepfather had if he was to support her and the child financially was that the father had to be involved to some extent with expenses etc. \n\nNTA at all, but why is she trying to get her stepfather to offer financial support rather than getting court ordered child support from the biological father...?", "NTA, you will end up paying child support.", "NTA\n\nIt's an awful situation for her to be in, and I sympathise with her.\n\nHowever, it would be extremely stupid of you to go along with this lie. I see literally no way that it will be a \"one and done\" sort of deal. You will be dealing with her family long term. \n\nThere's also a zero percent chance it doesn't get back to your family and hometown.\n\nI genuinely do not understand how they think they can ensure you're not involved in any photos of this gender reveal party. The father's presence has been demanded. There's no way someone doesn't snap a pic of you at it.\n\nEdit: I forgot another thing. If you lied, it would make it much less likely that they attempt to find biodad. Your friend is desperate but is not thinking clearly. Best thing for her to do is come clean and beg for help with an attorney to track AH biodad down.", "NTA\n\n\nDon't do it. I can only imagine what her dad and family will do to you.... Cause it probably seems like you're trying to run out on her and the kid.... And they will absolutely come after you. This isn't a one time thing. You will be that baby's Father and responsible for the baby.", "A private investigator should be able to work wonders with that information.", "NTA. Play stupid games you win stupid prizes. This lie isn\u2019t going to last 18 years it\u2019s best to tell them the truth now.", "NTA. She may try to pin some sort of financial responsibility on you. It would be easy to show why it isn't you that is responsible, but courts could be involved and it's a big mess. She just should be honest and say the father blocked her on everything and she can't contact him.", "NTA. Don't even get this started because it will only lead to more problems down the road. You didn't have any part in creating this bad situation. It's sort of outrageous that anyone expects you to pretend you caused an unplanned pregnancy, since it is such a serious thing and could ruin your reputation if people actually believe the lie. \n\nBesides that, if you pretend you caused the pregnancy, her family will be expecting you to help her financially. What happens when you don't send the money they expect and she is still broke and needs their help? How far will this go? Are they going to start court proceedings for child support against you? There's just no reason for you to get involved in this tangled-up mess.", "NTA. but she is . her body . her choice. and now she trying to find someone to foot the bill. smdh. put a distance between this person. this is like a racist or sexist or whateverist, imho. not a trait i would want to be involved with.", "NTA.

She did it, hence why she shall face the consequences of her action. You don't know what it will spiral into if you pretended to be the \"father\" and got yourself in a bad situation. You ain't the asshole, if she is stressed I think she should've been more careful with her actions.", "Is this going to be a half hour comedy or a one-off thriller series? Either way I would probably watch.\n\nIf this is your life, you need new friends.

You do not want to get linked to a child that is not yours.", "NTA.  It is reasonable for you to worry about lying to strangers about something this big. Not to mention all the practical issues that others have pointed out.  You do not have to make apologies for your decision. Those people getting on your case for not helping out?  They have not been put in your position they probably have not considered all the ramifications.", "NTA\n\nRUN!\n\nYou are entirely correct, this is not a one time lie. She could put you on the birth certificate, she could take you to court for child support. You could be parenting and paying for this child for the next 20 years.\n\nAnyone trying to guilt you into playing along needs to be informed of the possible long term implications and if they still don't see reason, run from them too.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that the family is giving her these rules and hoops to jump through, but what she needs to do is say \u201cI\u2019m not in contact with the guy because he blocked me, and I do not have control over that.\u201d", "Do you really think you aren\u2019t going to be asked your full name at some point which would lead to her family looking for your family or even if you have where you work say on socials they could get in touch with the company and before you know where you are your whole life is being ruined. The road to hell is paved with good intentions was not said for no reason, stay out of this mess! NTA", "NAH. I get she's in a real bind here, but she's asking a lot of you and all your concerns are valid. She's in a real tight spot, sounds like her parents are real old-fashioned (read that as a polite euphemism) which doesn't help, I do have sympathy for her and do think her plan of seeing if someone will pretend to be the father makes sense in that context.\n\nBut it's a LOT to ask. Not to mention it sounds like she faces a *lot* of pressure from her family and is susceptible to that pressure. So...what happens if you say you're the father and then they pressure her to take you to court for child support? If you claimed paternity at the reveal party even a DNA test might not get you off the hook (it's gray to be clear).\n\nA word of advice on the off chance you do decide to go through with it, and again I think you're more than within your rights to say no, absolutely positively **DO NOT**, under any circumstances, even if you have a gun to your head, sign the birth certificate as the father.", "INFO\n\nIs there a way that you could be the baby\u2019s father without being the biological father?
