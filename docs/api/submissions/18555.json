Don\u2019t listen to your friends.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t involve yourself at all.  You do not know what her father would do.  He would probably seek a lawyer to take you to court for child support and make life difficult by tracking your family down to hold you accountable.  You have no idea what will happen.  Don\u2019t start a lie.  She needs to stand up for herself and stop involving others.  \n\nIf her parents don\u2019t support her then she needs to find a way herself to support her and her child.  Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. She was irresponsible, got pregnant from a virtual stranger and decided to keep the baby. None of those actions are your fault.\n\nIf she doesn't have the financial ressources to have a baby, her solution shouldn't be to LIE to her own family so she could get their support and risk losing everything when her lie is uncovered.\n\nDon't get involved in that. They say it's a one-time thing : it clearly will not be. How does she plan to explain that the father is not there for the birth of the child ?!", "NTA. Her stepfather wants to nail someone for child support. I don\u2019t think you want to find yourself in any situation where you\u2019ll have to disprove paternity.", "I think you're right about \"this does not sound like the sort of lie you tell once\". This is the tip of the iceberg. Your friend may start bringing you to family dinners until she is \"ready to reveal\" she hasn't been in contact with the father, and before you know it, you may get sucked into a lie that consumes your life, and your emotional well-being.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - don't do it.  I can almost guarantee that her step-dad will corner you at some point to find out \"your intentions\" towards his daughter and grandchild, how you plan to support them, why you won't marry her, etc. etc. etc.\n\n**If she's old enough to decide that she wants to keep the baby, then she's old enough to be an adult and tell her family the truth** \\- namely that the baby is from a tinder date and the guy has blocked her completely.  In fact, if she just comes clean, it may be possible to have an attorney get involved to hold the real bio-dad accountable.\n\nBut don't do this.  It won't end up going well for anyone involved.", "NTA. \n\nIt will definitely not be something that you lie about it once and nothing happens after that.", "NTA, that\u2019s a completely ridiculous ask. Don\u2019t do this, if this is a legitimate situation the cat\u2019s going to be out of the bag at some point. Hopefully she can find the biodad and get child support. This sounds like a bad sitcom plot", "NTA, and this is a terrible idea. It won't just be for one day and she is being very emotionally manipulative.", "Oof, NTA. Especially considering that her family expects \"the father\" to help with expenses - aka you, who is not the father.\n\nYour friend has other options besides keeping the baby.", "NTA, run away! there is no way that this lie could put you anywhere but in a world of shit. The mom and stepdad want the father to step up and provide support, which is fair. They do not want to pay everything and the father skips away free. What were you going to say when they brought up support? When exactly was she planning on telling them the truth? Advise your friend to put her head down and tell the truth, then run far away from the whole mess.", "NTA\n\nThis is the kind of lie that will haunt you forever!   \nDo not go to that baby reveal *at any cost*. This is the basis of most psychodramas. You do not want to be the lead character in one of those!", "\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, OP. BTW, we\u2019re going to set up a meeting with you, and our lawyer, to discuss the child support agreement and order between you and our daughter. Are you available next Friday?\u201d If that doesn\u2019t sound like a conversation you want to have, then stay far away from the situation. NTA", "NTA. Her family said they wanted the father involved in the babies life- not that they wanted the father to show up to the baby shower then never come around again. This will definitely turn into a more than one time thing. If you agree to pretend now, you\u2019re setting yourself up for lots of trouble later. At worse the family could try to seek child support from you. You could refuse with a paternity test, but why put yourself in that awkward position? They could also blow up your social media. Even if you believe your friend, you just don\u2019t know what her family will do. \n\nI sympathize with your friend, she\u2019s in a hard position, but this is far too much to ask of someone. She should reach out to a lawyer to get information on how to seek child support from the real father.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't father the child. You're not responsible for role-playing the father at any point.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds dicey & dubious and no one can blame you for not wanting to take that risk.\n\nThe situation isn't sustainable, your friend can't keep lying to the parents forever, though the parents are super shitty for what they're doing to her.\n\nShe will need to think of another solution that doesn't involve you taking a huge risk.", "NTA.  Let\u2019s fast forward.  Is she going to cry and beg you to sign the birth certificate?  And if you show up at the shower event as \u201cfather\u201d, you know her stepfather is going to sue for child support.  And yes, DNA testing will prove you\u2019re not the father, but still now you have lawyer and court expenses.  Oh, there\u2019s no guarantee a judge won\u2019t say you took on paternal responsibility so yeah, child support.  \n\nIf this was a woman you cared about and wanted to be the father, I could support that 100%.  But playing a game that can wreck your life, nah, don\u2019t play.  You can\u2019t win.", "NTA\n\nHer situation sucks, fersher-fersher, but regrettably, it's still HER situation. You can try to help, but pretending to be the father is going to drag you into the middle of her situation, and you don't want to be there.\n\nYou can support people, but you are not obligated to set your life on fire to keep someone else's embers warm. She will figure it out one way or another, but she dug her hole by lying in the first place.", "NTA. Don't volunteer yourself to be the lightning rod for her choice. There is no way this doesn't result in problems for you. Her family will expect stuff from you right up the point you tell them you just posed for her convenience. And then they might still pressure you to do stuff for her or give you shit for decieving them. Going along with this can easily ruin your life.", "NTA. This isn't your partner, your child, or your problem.", "NTA - THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM, DO NOT GET INVOLVED\n\nYour friend needs to come clean and her parents need to help her sue the actual father of the baby for child support OR be a single parent, as she has made that decision for herself.  I can understand why her parents WANT the baby's father to support the baby... but at the end of the day, her game is not in sync with their reasoning, and she doesn't get that.", "NTA that's a huge thing to ask you to lie about and just a terrible idea in general. I doubt it'd be a one time thing. Also has she considered how much of a hard time people (I.e. her parents) will give you at the baby shower if they think you're some deadbeat dad? I'd like to think that her parents won't really leave her high and dry and Will help her out regardless. It's her problem to sort out at the end of the day, you can be a supportive friend without getting dragged into any potential drama and messiness.", "NTA. This is her mess that she got herself into and now she's trying to drag you into it without caring how it might affect you. This will definitely not be a one time lie, just throwing that out there. So what, you show up and the stepfather pulls you aside to chat with you and you have to get grilled and come up with a bunch of lies on top of the original lie? No thanks! She said repeatedly she wouldn't ask you anymore, and that it was up to you, but here she is crying and begging and hounding you to do something you aren't comfortable with, which makes her kind of a bad friend. \n\nQuestion though. If she knows the dad but can't get a hold of him, can she not still go after him for child support??", "Don't do this. This is a ridiculous thing to ask of someone. And it's not going to be a one time lie either. If she's old enough to have sex and get pregnant, she should be adult enough to deal with the consequences of her actions. NTA.", "It we not be a one time thing. It doesn't matter what she says on that aspect, she's deluding herself and by extension you.\n\nYou are right that her parents could very well, if you \"disappear\", contact your friends and family to get them to make you stay involved. That isn't an unlikely scenario and would cause a lot of problems for you.\n\nNTA\n\nI understand she's desperate but this is not a reasonable thing to ask.", "\"... she guarantees it will be a one-time thing\"\n\nYou know it won't be though right?\n\nHer family would know you as the father. When you disappear and the girl is all set to become a single mother, are they just going to forget all about you?\n\nI understand that the poor girl is desperate and grasping at straws, but to drag you into what is a whopper of lie that **will** get found out is a truly terrible idea.\n\nThe other girls need to back the fuck off with the pressure too. \n\nDo not do this.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This sounds like the plot to \"A Walk In The Clouds\" except OP isn't Keanu Reeves and I don't think it will end as satisfying. Nope. Don't do it. Your friend was irresponsible and now she has to live with it. Sounds harsh, but that's the reality of the situation.", "NTA. No need to get involved in your friend\u2019s unfortunate situation. How long would you plan on keeping up the lie?", "NTA for helping out your friend, however be careful, depending on where you are in the world, taking on a \"fatherly\" role can be grounds for a court to assign you child support responsibilities.", "NTA. NO NO NO do not do this. Do not let yourself be manipulated in this way. She told a massive lie to her parents and she's trying to get you to cover for her lies. Her parents should cancel the genital reveal party and put that money to supporting her if they want to give her money.", "NTA, and please don't even consider doing this. Aside from all the family problems (on both sides) thus could cause, you could easily end up finding yourself financially responsible for a child who is not yours.", "Absolutely no good could come from that!", "NTA. Nothing good will come from this. This is the worst idea imaginable.", "NTA. Worst case scenario, this is step one down the slippery slope that puts your name on the birth certificate and gets you forced into child support. Sucks that your friend is in a tough position, but this ask is too much.", "NTA. Not the daddy. Don't make a mistake. Down the road if not sooner that can come back and bite.", "> One of the stipulations that her stepfather had if he was to support her and the child financially was that the father had to be involved to some extent with expenses etc. \n\nNTA at all, but why is she trying to get her stepfather to offer financial support rather than getting court ordered child support from the biological father...?", "NTA, you will end up paying child support.", "NTA\n\nIt's an awful situation for her to be in, and I sympathise with her.\n\nHowever, it would be extremely stupid of you to go along with this lie. I see literally no way that it will be a \"one and done\" sort of deal. You will be dealing with her family long term. \n\nThere's also a zero percent chance it doesn't get back to your family and hometown.\n\nI genuinely do not understand how they think they can ensure you're not involved in any photos of this gender reveal party. The father's presence has been demanded. There's no way someone doesn't snap a pic of you at it.\n\nEdit: I forgot another thing. If you lied, it would make it much less likely that they attempt to find biodad. Your friend is desperate but is not thinking clearly. Best thing for her to do is come clean and beg for help with an attorney to track AH biodad down.", "NTA\n\n\nDon't do it. I can only imagine what her dad and family will do to you.... Cause it probably seems like you're trying to run out on her and the kid.... And they will absolutely come after you. This isn't a one time thing. You will be that baby's Father and responsible for the baby.", "A private investigator should be able to work wonders with that information.", "NTA. Play stupid games you win stupid prizes. This lie isn\u2019t going to last 18 years it\u2019s best to tell them the truth now.", "NTA. She may try to pin some sort of financial responsibility on you. It would be easy to show why it isn't you that is responsible, but courts could be involved and it's a big mess. She just should be honest and say the father blocked her on everything and she can't contact him.", "NTA. Don't even get this started because it will only lead to more problems down the road. You didn't have any part in creating this bad situation. It's sort of outrageous that anyone expects you to pretend you caused an unplanned pregnancy, since it is such a serious thing and could ruin your reputation if people actually believe the lie. \n\nBesides that, if you pretend you caused the pregnancy, her family will be expecting you to help her financially. What happens when you don't send the money they expect and she is still broke and needs their help? How far will this go? Are they going to start court proceedings for child support against you? There's just no reason for you to get involved in this tangled-up mess.", "NTA. but she is . her body . her choice. and now she trying to find someone to foot the bill. smdh. put a distance between this person. this is like a racist or sexist or whateverist, imho. not a trait i would want to be involved with.", "NTA.

She did it, hence why she shall face the consequences of her action. You don't know what it will spiral into if you pretended to be the \"father\" and got yourself in a bad situation. You ain't the asshole, if she is stressed I think she should've been more careful with her actions.", "Is this going to be a half hour comedy or a one-off thriller series? Either way I would probably watch.\n\nIf this is your life, you need new friends.

You do not want to get linked to a child that is not yours.", "NTA.  It is reasonable for you to worry about lying to strangers about something this big. Not to mention all the practical issues that others have pointed out.  You do not have to make apologies for your decision. Those people getting on your case for not helping out?  They have not been put in your position they probably have not considered all the ramifications.", "NTA\n\nRUN!\n\nYou are entirely correct, this is not a one time lie. She could put you on the birth certificate, she could take you to court for child support. You could be parenting and paying for this child for the next 20 years.\n\nAnyone trying to guilt you into playing along needs to be informed of the possible long term implications and if they still don't see reason, run from them too.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that the family is giving her these rules and hoops to jump through, but what she needs to do is say \u201cI\u2019m not in contact with the guy because he blocked me, and I do not have control over that.\u201d", "Do you really think you aren\u2019t going to be asked your full name at some point which would lead to her family looking for your family or even if you have where you work say on socials they could get in touch with the company and before you know where you are your whole life is being ruined. The road to hell is paved with good intentions was not said for no reason, stay out of this mess! NTA", "NAH. I get she's in a real bind here, but she's asking a lot of you and all your concerns are valid. She's in a real tight spot, sounds like her parents are real old-fashioned (read that as a polite euphemism) which doesn't help, I do have sympathy for her and do think her plan of seeing if someone will pretend to be the father makes sense in that context.\n\nBut it's a LOT to ask. Not to mention it sounds like she faces a *lot* of pressure from her family and is susceptible to that pressure. So...what happens if you say you're the father and then they pressure her to take you to court for child support? If you claimed paternity at the reveal party even a DNA test might not get you off the hook (it's gray to be clear).\n\nA word of advice on the off chance you do decide to go through with it, and again I think you're more than within your rights to say no, absolutely positively **DO NOT**, under any circumstances, even if you have a gun to your head, sign the birth certificate as the father.", "INFO\n\nIs there a way that you could be the baby\u2019s father without being the biological father?

Carry on with your life, it\u2019s not your problem.", ">After talking about it with a friend, I decided I really did not want to because a.) this does not sound like the sort of lie you tell once, and idk how long I\u2019d have to keep being involved \n\nThat's an unusually prescient thought from a 20 year old male.  Good for you.", "NTA\n\nCan't  your friend could reach out to a lawyer to inform the father of his child-to-be, and hold him legally responsible for it?", "NTA. They\u2019re all being nuts.", "Do it if you want to live a life of looking over your shoulder for this crazy stepfather. \n\nThe father being around should mean that the girls needs more help. It\u2019s not the mother or the baby\u2019s fault that he wants nothing to do with it. \n\nThe stepfather sounds like an irrational person.  I would not want to participate in trying to lie to an irrational person.", "None of this makes any sense. There\u2019s simply no way this is going to be a \u201cone time thing\u201d. Obviously  her parents are serious about this, or she wouldn\u2019t even be asking. \n\nHow is she going to explain this later when you\u2019re not there for the birth, if she needs their support now she\u2019s going to need it still months from now. If she introduces you, that\u2019s it, no one else can fill the role and she\u2019s clearly not going to come clean or she would have already done so. \n\nI haven\u2019t been 20 in a while, but I don\u2019t remember me and my friends being THIS stupid. I\u2019m not sure why every single person in your group is pressuring you into this, but it\u2019s just fucking weird.", "NTA and people need to remember that unless you\u2019re using at least one type of reliable birth control correctly, you are trying to get pregnant. I used two religiously and have managed to make it to 42 without a kid. This is your friends mess to deal with. Don\u2019t do it. If you do, I can guarantee her parents would hound you relentlessly and you don\u2019t want that getting back to your friends and family.", "I think it is sad that women are guilted into carrying a baby from a one night stand. Women should not be burdened with a child for simply wanting to have casual sex.", "Your friend needs to get a family attorney and go after the father for child support. If you DM me your state, I'm happy to help you find legal resources for your friend.\n\nAnd under no circumstance should you pretend to be the father. This is a bad bad bad BAD choice that could have legal rammifucations.\n\nDepending on what state you're in, this could actually make you legally liable for child support or, at the very least, cause you need a lawyer to prove you aren't.", "NTA and DO NOT change your mind. This will NOT be a one-time thing, and in all honesty you could end up legally liable for this child knowing the way things go.", "Nta nta nta if everyone is so concerned for her, they can pool their money and buy a \u201cescort\u201c who professionally accompanies people on dates. They\u2019re out there.", "Dude knocked her up then blocked her when he found out... Holy shit! Do people actually do this?!", "NTA. \n\nBut you know who the A is? Stepdad. I say you go to the shower as a friend and casualy mentuon how happy you are that her family supports her. Being a single parent is difficult, especially when one parent is unreachable. \n\nIt boggles my mind why they would withhold support ... because she has less support. That's just dumb. It's almost as dumb as it would he to pretend to be the father. If you skip out of that Step dad is coming for you. In the very least its a headache. But it could result in 18 yrs of support. The civil law system is flawed. Dont set youself up to be part of that failure.", "NTA, I don\u2019t see how this doesn\u2019t backfire on you. It\u2019s going to be a train wreck.", "NTA\nNot your kids not your problem", "This is literally one of the most insane things I've ever read on this sub. There is no way it would be a one time thing. When the kid is born, who are her parents going to say is their father to them? Your friend is about to be a parent, it's time for her to bite the bullet and grow up fast. She won't be able to lie her way through parenthood unless she wants to really mess up her kid's life. NTA.", "OH MY GOD NOOOOO!!! \n\nDon't be stupid, man! This family isn't gonna just be like \"wow ok we met this person once and will be perfectly content to never hear anything from or about him again including absolutely not financial support!\" \n\nNTA\n\nWhat an absolutely insane thing to ask someone to do!", "NTA\n\nHer step dad and mom would likely settle for her officially filing for child support with her tinder date.\n\nThis is not a Hallmark movie (or a lifetime movie). Her elaborate scheme would not pan out and would result in her family feeling horribly betrayed and manipulated when this inevitably came out.", "NTA I think it would be a really bad idea. What if her dad decides to punch you? There would absolutely be pictures all over the internet.", "NTA, dont do it.", "NTA. I\u2019d run my dude.", "Absolutely not", "What in the world? \n\nHow does anyone see this working? If you did this it would be an act you\u2019d have to keep up much longer than a one time thing.\n\nNTA", "This is a shitty situation, but you\u2019re NTA. BIGGEST asshole in this is the dude who blocked her when there was a consequence to his actions. Hopefully one day she\u2019ll be able to get the kid\u2019s DNA on 23andme or something, cause until then she\u2019s SOL.", "Ohhh no no no no. NTA for sure. The biggest red flag for me here is that her stepfather said that the father has to be involved with expenses. If you pretend to be the father, you\u2019re gonna end up paying, literally and figuratively. You\u2019re not obligated to do this just because she\u2019s stressed", "NTA and you know that there will be picture(s) of you posted with the gender reveal.  All it would take is for someone, even a vengeful ex in the future, to get ahold of that picture, post it everywhere including your employer info, and say that you're a deadbeat dad who abandoned your child.  That would ruin your reputation and maybe future job prospects.\n\nDon't get involved with this.  She can find some random guy at college who will stand in and never be seen again.  Maybe just for the price of a case of beer.  Or... she can actually tell her parents the truth.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. If she is not able to tell the truth to her parents now then how will she tell them the truth later after the fact. Forget your reputation with your family, your reputation where you live will be completely ruined if they start posting pics and comments on social media.", "Besides NTA, this is just stupid.  So the parents will only support her if she has a partner yet they\u2019re throwing a gender reveal? She\u2019s already pregnant \u201cout of wedlock\u201d, what\u2019s the difference if the guy who knocked her up ghosted her? A boyfriend could have done the same, that\u2019s not her fault.  As if the grandparents are going to not be involved once the baby is born.  And, why would they throw a gender reveal when they\u2019ve never even met the dad if that\u2019s so important to them? This is a made up drama or a scam.  Do not do this.", "This is definitely the sort of lie that spirals out of control immediately. Don't do it.\n\nEdit to add: I actually think it's quite likely that she has already told her family you are the father. Think about it - she's told them she's in contact with the father, but her stepfather hasn't asked for a name? There might be a reason that only you has been asked to do this. I'm worried you've already been named as the dad OP. Talk to your friend...", "She could be honest with her family and tell them that she'd prefer for the father to be involved, but when she tried to tell him, he blocked her... that's not her fault...\n\nAnd once the baby's born, she can sue him for child support.", "NTA and she needs to grow up and take responsibility for herself, she's about to become a mother", "Yeah there is absolutely no way this will be a one-off thing. How does she intent to explain your absense? why doesn't she do that now? What if the family start to ask you for money, or demand you do other stuff? Nah, she needs to be accountable for her actions.", "I'm not surprised she's stressed, that's quite the pickle she's put herself in. As her friend, I'm also not surprised that you feel for her and want to do something to help. Sounds like you care about her, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nHelping someone perpetuate a lie, especially one as big and as lasting as this, has nuclear bomb written all over it. You did the right thing for yourself and honestly her by turning her down. We all make choices and we all live with the consequences. Maybe he wouldn't have set this boundary if she'd been honest in the first place and it's his way of calling her bluff. It's hard to say. She's about to be a single mom. She needs to find a way to be her own knight in shining armor and learn not to rely on others or manipulation tactics to solve her problems. Choosing to be a parent is choosing to grow up and put someone else first.\n\nNTA. Don't let other people tell you any of this is your fault. You aren't the father. You aren't required to do anything. Are your housemates and friends all female? It doesn't sound like any of them are offering to do this so called one time non-solution. Stick to your guns.", "Please don\u2019t do this. Your gut instinct was to say no - your gut was right", "DO NOT DO IT. Her and your \u201cfriends\u201d are not thinking clearly how far this lie will really have to go. What about when she gives birth and the birth certificate? Is she going to force you to be there when she\u2019s in labor? Is she going to force you to sign the birth certificate to keep face in front of her family? What if she puts your name on the birth certificate? If you don\u2019t show up after the baby arrives? You will be interrogated at the baby shower, after delivery, and for the rest of your life because of this lie. For either being a \u201cdeadbeat dad\u201d or for being a liar. Don\u2019t let your friends gaslight you into this situation because there will be consequences. If they really feel bad then they can find someone else to play the role or step up and help her financially. She did the deed, now she has to deal with the consequences. She shouldn\u2019t take anyone down with her in the process. So many red flags in my opinion.", "NTA. You would have to be the world's biggest idiot to go along with the stupid ploy. This friend made the choice to have sex with a total stranger (tinder date), made the choice to not use condoms or birth control, made the choice to have this baby, and now she has to deal with the consequences. She needs to hire someone to track that asshole who knocked her up and so she can put a child support claim on his ass.", "NTA don\u2019t do it, but consider an actor", "NTA\n\nShe has to be honest with her family & tell them the father blocked her after finding out about the baby. You are right. This is not a one time favor.", "Have you ever seen that Facebook or YouTube video where the guys gets pulled over and lies and says his wife is having a baby? \n\nSo the cops follows him for proof and doesn\u2019t leave this guys side until his \u201cwife\u201d has passed and his \u201cson\u201d went to college\n\nThats the vibe I get from this. This is a BIG \u201cone time\u201d lie. Big lies don\u2019t go away. You keep adding small lies. It\u2019ll eat you up inside. \nEven if it is ONE TIME you are under no obligation to lie to a bunch of strangers who might want to keep forcing you to support \u201cyour\u201d child", "NTA feel like i\u2019ve read a fanfic like this before lmao real life is not fanfic. there is no way this would go well", "NTA. She can hire an actor if she needs someone to stand in. You could even offer to help pay for an actor.", "She needs to get a private investigator to go after the Tinder guy. Stay away from this! NTA", "NTA. This is a mess from beginning to end, and you pretending to be the father will only make it worse", "NTA", "You better worry. Sometimes, people have just been named on the birth certificate, and time was allowed to elapse, and they didn't even know and because of time they found themselves responsible despite DNA tests and never signing anything.  NTA, but this is not okay.", "THIS!!! Like what happens the day baby is born and her family demands the father be there? Or the kids first bday? Or any other important moment in that kids life for the rest of their life?", "Definitely! She can hire an actor from Craigslist if she wants to embark on some crazy deception. Hopefully she knows the name or phone number of whomever that she slept with (there are ways to find someone\u2019s name from their address and see who is associated with a phone number) because that way the government can order a paternity test and she can get child support. Worst case, she can look into living in a shelter if she doesn\u2019t have any other way to support herself.", "Seriously, wtf man.  That's how you get put on the birth certificate and end up paying child support.", "It\u2019s a (baby) trap - stay away! \n\nWtf - why are you even considering this OP? I\u2019m sorry your friend got pregnant off a deadbeat Tinder date, but she\u2019s the one that chose to lie to her parents about it - it\u2019s not your job to clean up her mess and not your responsibility to save her. You\u2019re not even in a relationship with her for crying out loud - wake up!!", "Is it fair to say she was irresponsible? Birth control could have failed... Maybe she doesn't have access to abortion. I agree with your other points though.", "Thanks for the suggestion! I will try that. Idk her personally but I know her instagram at least", "I have no idea how tinder works either so I could not say. Considering she seems to think it is impossible to track him down, I would guess not. I imagine there must be something like that in place, but I am far from an expert on child support laws.", "Thanks! I feel bad for her too, but this doesn't feel like a solution", "thanks!", "Thanks !", "She seems to think that because he blocked her there is no way of reaching him since she does not know his address. I imagine a lawyer could do more but im far from an expert", "thanks!", "That's what I fear, I cannot imagine it would only be a one-time thing", "From what I know, the idea came to her because a friend joked that she should get one of her male friends to pretend to be the father. I don't think that friend meant it seriously, but it clearly stuck in my pregnant friend's mind since that seems to be her 'solution'. Idk how much info she's given her family but I think (or hope ig) it's unlikely she's been saying it's me.", "Yeah, let all of the friends giving you grief pool their money and hire an actor for the day (possibly someone from the drama department). \n\nThis lie has the potential to stay with for a long time...like 18 years.", "That is the only logical reason why they want the father there so badly. And it's what I would do as a parent if I got hold of the father.", "I feel like you might be American, OP seems to be from the UK. He would not be responsible for paying child support as he\u2019s not the paternal father, he would have to be an active \u201cstep parent\u201d to possibly be ordered by the courts to pay for child support and it would take a lot for the mother to win against OP. \nOP wouldn\u2019t be on the birth certificate either. \nNot saying OP should agree to it, just saying he would definitely not be responsible for child support.", "No, he wouldn't. You would have to sign the birth certificate or establish paternity to be responsible for child support.", "Do you have text messages from you pregnant friend asking you to do this? If not it might be worth texting something along the lines of \u2018so what exactly are you asking me to do here?\u2019 to her.

A whole group is pressuring you to do this and with that many people willing to say you are the father\u2026 save screen shots of people asking you to lie so you have proof. I\u2019d say she has already told the parents it was you which is why she is getting so desperate to make it happen. Give her a clear \u201cI am never doing that.

I know that if I were her age and having to go to my family and explain that I got pregnant with a tinder hook up I would feel panicky enough to make up a lie. The problem with lies is that they spiral. Even in my thirties I think I would be embarrassed to admit to my parents that I was pregnant and don't have anything more than a name and phone number for the bio father. Then you add in the financial dependence. Is it wrong to lie to your parents? Yes. Do I have empathy for a very young lady terrified of not being able to finish her schooling, especially when she will have a child to care for alone? Also yes.", "My father wasn't even the country when I was born and he was put on my birth certificate.", "That's not entirely accurate. The person does not have to be present to be put on the birth certificate. You just have to have the fathers date of birth, full legal name and I *think* their social security number. \n\nMy father lived 5 states away from where my mom gave birth. He expressly did NOT want to be named on my birth certificate and attempted to dodge responsibility. My mom was able to put him on the cert anyway without his consent or presence. He attempted to contest it when he found out, a judge ruled he was shit out of luck since the DNA test proved paternity. \n\nThere is a small window of time after a birth certificate is signed that a named father can contest being named. This time frame varies state to state (countries outside the US may have varying laws)."]}
