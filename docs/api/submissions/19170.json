I personally think it would be great, you didn\u2019t think about yourself or your needs but of her. Something she wanted that you couldn\u2019t necessarily afford.

He's giving his wife something he paid nothing for.", "They thought of a light loophole that allowed them to get out of buying a present.", "Again...it COST him...the gift he would have received. Think of it as like an exchange. Let's say they gave him a gift he actually wanted worth 250. Right? He returns or sells this item for cash or credit. He then purchases the camera.

You selected a gift for her that she genuinely wants and sacrificed receiving something for yourself.\n\nYour friends are dumb for criticising this being passed on.

That's the point, no?!", "Of course. I'm just trying to change the perspective. The coworkers didn't buy it for his GF, they bought it to make him happy. And he was the most happy if he gave it away. Which was exactly the goal. \n\nJust my opinion.", "NTA for passing on a gift, but YTA for asking for a gift for someone else.  As someone who contributed, I would be mad that you asked for a gift for someone else when I was contributing for a gift for YOU.  I do not know your girlfriend.  I did not work with her.
