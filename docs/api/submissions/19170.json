Unwrap it, check it, then re-wrap it yourself and add a nice card.", "NTA - you are foregoing a gift to get someone else a gift. That's the same as using your money on a gift.", "NTA. This is essentially the same as getting a $250 gift card and buying her a camera. You just didn't have to order it on Amazon or drive to the store.", "If my hubs earned a $250 gift and thought to give me something I wanted\u2026.I would be thrilled.   \n\n\nBut please\u2026.rewrap it yourself\u2026you gotta do something.

I think it's pretty sweet actually that you thought of your girlfriend first.", "NTA\nYou immediately thought of your GF instead of just asking for something random. That's so thoughtful!", "NTA. It's your gift to do what the fuck you want with it. Plus, you spent a decade working at a place that clearly didn't value you, so you deserve to treat your girlfriend to something nice without having to spend your own cash. And as for your mates, they can go fuck themselves.", "NTA. You got what she wanted, they offered you a gift and you immediatly thought of her. That is a great deal.", "INFO - how would your girlfriend feel if she found out?

Consider them your personal shoppers.", "NTA. I see this as them giving you a $250 bonus and you getting her the camera she wants but cutting out the middle man.  \n\n\nAlso, a gift is a gift because it doesn't cost the recipient anything and, as you said, you paid for it with your blood, sweat, and tears.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should definitely give it to her but not sure if she will appreciate it as a birthday gift. Are you going to tell her where it\u2019s from? Perhaps she could get 2 gifts this year?

Why does that matter at all?\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty sweet of this person to do this. When they were asked what gift they wanted the first thing they thought of was their partner.
