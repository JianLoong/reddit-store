My daughter (7F) knows she\u2019s not allowed to go upstairs unless I am around or an adult is around so she stayed downstairs mingling with her aunts. The dinner havent even started at this point when I heard a loud crash from upstairs. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s son was crying because he fell off a stool in my office after climbing up and dumping almost a hundred of superworms in one of my Tarantula\u2019s enclosure. An FYI, live superworms can harm Ts especially when in molt. When I saw what happened tens of these worms already burrowed in my T\u2019s substrate. Not to mention the rest trying to burrow too. This means I have to remove my T from her enclosure and clean up the worms. \n\nI was stressed and shouted \u201cWhat the hell did you do?!\u201d to the kid. I still helped him up tho but all of my aunts and uncles ended up shouting back at me for being an asshole to the kid when I could\u2019ve been gentle. \n\nI love my pets and this really stressed me out so much I ended up crying and leaving everyone to fend for themselves downstairs.

I seriously hate how people think they can let their kids run amuck in other's houses and destroy their things. But that's kids for you. every time my daughter has friends over, they're always in the one place I don't want them to be. They can't play in her room or outside or the living room.

Kid was WAY out of line, invading your space, and did EXACTLY the thing your rule is intended to prevent.  His parents should be apologizing profusely to you for their kid running roughshod over your hospitality.  I\u2019m sorry this happened to you!", "The parents weren't supervising their kids after you made one specific rule. Not only did the kids not respect it, the parents didn't either. I mean yeah shouting at kids isn't cool but it can happen in stressful situations and this genuinely was. NTA", "NTA. A 7 year old can respect rules but a 10 year can\u2019t? Sorry, 10 years old is definitely old enough not to disregard rules, especially in someone else\u2019s home (unless the kid has some kind of neurodivergence)", "How\u2019s your T?", "NTA You didn't have to be gentle. The kid was a disobedient, nosy troublemaker who could have harmed your pets and broken your stuff. Ten is too old for that. Everyone being \"gentle\" to him in situations like these is probably *why* he feels free to do what he wants in someone else's house, going into places he knows he's not allowed, doing things he knows he shouldn't be doing.\n\n\"Come on Timmy, you know you shouldn't be doing that. All right, now that's settled, let's go get some ice cream.\" Timmy kicks over a pot plant on the way out while giving you the finger. \"Does that mean you only want one scoop? I was going to give you two.\"\n\nI swear I have to subtract about five years from the age of kids in stories like these to get them to make sense.", "NTA \n\nI would have thrown all that shouted at me out of the house that instant, so rude. Remember to send a bill if anything broke to his mother", "NTA, you clearly stated that no one was to enter your office, and your family most likely knows about your pets. Children shuld be taught to be careful and responsible arund animals, as well as to keep out of rooms if they are explicitly banned from entering. Yes, kids are curious and a ban makes a room all that more interesting, but why the heck should you be extra gentle after he got hurt doing something he was specifically told not to do and endangering your pets? It's the parent's job to watch the kids, they should apologize to you check how their son was doing and then ask if you need help cleaning up.", "NTA  \n\nThank goodness the dumb kid fell off the stool. If he hadn't you never would have known. and you could  have lost your spider.  \n\nI am not a fan of yelling at anyone.    It's not a productive way of communicating.   But there are circumstances that  you just can't help yourself.    This is one of those circumstances.    \n\nAt ten a child should have been able not only to not have stayed out of the room, but not to mess with shit while in there.      \n\nLet the parents be gentle - you had a right to be pissed.", "NTA don\u2019t let anybody make you feel like you are an asshole you were in the right I have children and I wouldn\u2019t never leave them in supervising somebody else\u2019s home. I have two boys one that loves any kind of animals or amphibians. Any creature lol and he would love to see a tarantula, but he would never go into somebody\u2019s place where they told him not to go without permission.", "NTA, and frankly I don't understand all these Y-T-A judgments.\n\nI would have done a lot more than yelling, and would have thrown everyone giving me the slightest bit of grief about it out of the house, most likely never to return.  The child, if he had even an ounce of common sense, would have been in fear of significant bodily injury and would likely avoid me for the rest of his natural life (and I'm fine with that).  The kid would have been scared enough that he had night terrors for weeks afterwards.\n\nHad the aunt slapped me (I realize it didn't happen, but OP was afraid it was a possibility), she would likely have gotten a lot more in return, but I gather this is an Asian family and admit I don't understand some things about the culture.  Also, I recognize that I am a large, white, male Boomer and am much less reserved or concerned about what others think than when I was younger.  I also suspect that this did not happen in the US, so standards regarding familial relationships may be different.\n\nEndanger my pet, though, and emotions are going to be running VERY high and reactions may well be instinctual rather than rational.  I would likely not have helped the child up NEARLY as gently as OP did.\n\nIntentionally opening a closed cage, in a room you were specifically told not to be in, where you know there is a living creature and dumping ANYTHING into the cage is not an \"accident\".  It is a malicious act of vandalism and cruelty and the fact that a 10 year old did all of this means that the kid needs to have some significant repercussions, not just \". . . a talking to.\"\n\nAfter I calmed down, I might give the kid - and mom - ONE CHANCE at offering a sincere, heartfelt apology that truly shows the kid knows that he messed up, and mom recognizes that he knows it, that she knows he deserved far more than just being yelled at, and that mom has doled out an appropriate punishment.  If that didn't happen, I'd have no further contact with them.\n\nOP - recognize you need to be a bit more proactive in protecting your pets.  Your daughter may not be an issue, but she is going to have friends and eventually they are going to come over to visit and you cannot count on them being as well behaved as she is.  I would suggest a lock on the door, and maybe a gate across the stairs when you have company if there's no reason for guests to go up there.  It not only creates a barrier, it also would likely make noise or draw attention if someone was trying to take it down or get around it.  One of those little alarms that chimes when a door opens might not be a bad idea, either.\n\nEDIT - There would be no apology from me to the child for yelling.  Raised voices occurred due to HIS actions alone, are appropriate to avert an emergency and were entirely justified.  There would be an explanation that others with less patience than I have could happily have thrashed him, and that he's damned lucky I have such a sparkly personality.  Mom would have either participated in or gotten the same sermon, and other relatives who felt inclined to weigh in would have been told that it was none of their concern, they should mind their own business and, by the way, they are free to host the next family gathering at their house since it wouldn't be happening at mine.", "NTA", "Inquiring minds say you will only be the asshole if you don't tell us what species of Ts you've got!", "NTA - crisis/urgent situation regarding your pets? Yeah, sometimes you yell. If possible, maybe you can sit him down, apologize for yelling, but explain why you did, why what he did was so distressing, and how it could have harmed your tarantula... or do nothing; totally valid option as well.", "NTA you had ONE rule and the kid's owners couldnt even make him obey it (and at 10 he should know wtf the word NO means)", "NTA.\n\nyour house has rules. the child didn't just got upstairs he started messing with the animals and actually harming them. at age 10 he knows better, or should for his parents yelling at you? ask them why he isn't better mannered/why they don't teach him to respect rules when a guest?", "NTA\n\nPets are living things with feelings. They\u2019re not objects. It\u2019s really unacceptable that someone\u2019s parents think YELLING at their kid is too much when literally they could have killed another living thing. \n\nObviously you now know you need a lock or two bc your shit family can\u2019t mind their manners.", "NTA either way, but did your cousin actually tell her son he wasn't allowed in your office?", "NTA superworms will literally chew on anything. Lucky you got to them just in time. A little later on then a lot of harm could have been done to the tarantula. Regardless, it's not your child. Where were the parents? It's not your job to keep an eye on other people's kids.", "NTA a 10 year old knows exactly what they are doing when they're breaking rules and I'm astounded at all the people in here insisting that you should have known that a 5th grader would be so unable to control their impulses. Kids that age absolutely can and when they make a bad choice instead you're perfectly justified in losing your cool.", "NTA. kid broke the only rule there was. he needed to be yelled at bc he could\u2019ve seriously hurt an animal. the parents are too soft and as a result they have a brat who could\u2019ve injured an animal", "NTA.

You made one rule, and the kid broke the rule and could have injured your tarantula. Probably just as well he fell and it made a noise, because otherwise, you may not have known until it was too late. The parents deserve just as much backlash as the kids. They weren't watching, and should have been.", "I would\u2019ve told everyone to get the hell out of my house nta", "NTA. You are absolutely right to have shouted. Maybe out of sheet horror but he deserved some reprimand. The family members who called you out obviously failed in their parenting of that troublemaker who did not only disregard clear instructions but also was dumb enough to put those hundred worms in while falling off a chair. Don\u2019t have that kid around next time. And next time those people show lock your rooms.", "NTA. 10 is old enough to understand rules, and he broke them, in a way that could have seriously harmed your beloved pets. Despite being severely arachnophobic, I am mad for you in this situation as I am extremely protective of any pet friends of mine or anyone else, and I hope your babies are okay after this! I would have been livid. Also, maybe put a lock on the door for the future so there is no chance anyone gets in there", "Solidly NTA.\n\nListen I fully get that yelling at the kid wasn\u2019t ideal, and I even get the parents being a little defensive right away (\u201cWhy are you yelling at my kid and saying hell while he\u2019s crying?!\u201d)\n\nBut they\u2019re responsible me for their kid and you didn\u2019t continue to just scream at the kid. \n\nIf you just went to town screaming to kept behaving negatively towards the young child who did a dumb young child thing you\u2019d be the asshole\u2026 but you didn\u2019t do that.

People should not have kids if they cannot watch them. Shouting is understandable given the circumstance.", "NTA.  He's 10.  He KNEW he was doing something he shouldn't.\n\nHowever, the other adults here were TA.  I would send out a group text that says \"due to the damage and wanton disrespect to me and my pets, I will no longer be hosting parties at my house.

He broke the rule. Not only did he entered the forbidden room but he tampered with your stuff. The other parents yelling at you negate his consequences of getting yelled at.

You set a rule in YOUR house, told your family and rather than parent their kids they let them run wild. While I don't advocate shouting at the kids - I would have taken it out on the parents - being upset and worried about your pets obviously made it a little hard to keep composure in the moment. I would apologize to the child afterwards and tell them exactly why it was that I got upset, but the parents would be receiving a nice reaming-out. I can't stand when people just expect their kids to be 'watched' just because there are other adults there.", "NTA. They kid broke the rules, made a mess, and endangered the lives of your pets. I don't care if they're \"just tarantulas\" to you, they're living things that have value to OP.

Your house your rules, also a 10 year old is perfectly capable to understand and comply rules.", "NTA\n\nI am guessing but as the 10 year old seemed to have almost immediately went to the one place he shouldn\u2019t have the parents did tell him he wasn\u2019t allowed there.  \n\nAgree 10 year old knew better and the minimal yelling you did hopefully (but doubtful) made an impression on him. \n\nAs you already noted get an external locking doorknob which has a real key for any room you don\u2019t want people in when you are not aware.  I\u2019d say your bedroom and  obviously the office.  The store should be able to key them to be the same if that\u2019s what you want.", "NTA. I would ban the cousin and her kid from coming to your place.", "NTA. Jeez, the parents of that kid are brain-dead and obviously didn't listen to you when you told them about the rule and to instill it on the kid.

I feel bad that you had to go through this \u2639\ufe0f", "NTA the little brat deserved a yelling, and I really can't stand over permissive parents who don't enforce rules to their precious little crap.", "NTA \nman that kid should have gotten a shouting at by his parents too . That\u2019s how my mom would have handled it . Anything an auntie says to me my mom would back up.", "NTA I know in a lot of these situations people always say well you should have locked the door... But no, you shouldn't have to. The children's parents should be watching their kids and teaching them to respect other people's homes, things, and pets. At the very least they shouldn't be leaving the kids work no one in the other room to watch them. \n\nMuch as I love my friends and trust them as parents, I don't allow kids at my house because we are child free and I have no intention of childproofing my home or risking damage for visitors.", "NTA and I would have kicked them out", "NTA. I have a rule in my house when it comes to kids- the parents discipline and keep them managed or I will. If they don't want me saying anything to their children, they can do it or leave. My house, my rules.", "NTA. \n\nThe kid fucked around and found out.  \nThe parents should be making him apologize to you and work off some restitution for the damage. \n\nWhen my children have done similar I very pointedly told them that I don\u2019t feel bad for them because they knew what they were doing was wrong.", "NTA. Ffs, he's 10 years old. That's old enough to understand rules and to control his impulses. He entered the room willingly, and he KNEW he wasn't supposed to. He did something incredibly reckless and risked the health and life of your pet. You had EVERY reason to shout at him. And based on the fact that everyone else blamed you for yelling instead of him for breaking a very clear rule, it sounds like he's being raised without a proper notion of rules and consequences for misbehaving.", "NTA. Yelling at the kid sounds like a pretty standard reaction to me. Chaos insued, your tarantula could have been injured, the kid could have been injured, and there was also now a mess. I'd have done the same. \n\nEven if the kid wasnt told to not go in there,  he shouldn't be running off and snooping in rooms in a home that wasn't his. That's just rude. Hope he realizes he made a mistake despite everyone else being upset at you rather than him.", "NTA, he is a kid but he screwed up. Overprotective relatives are the worst things that can happen to a brat. He needs to feel he messed up otherwise he will just do that again.\n\nI wouldn't allow him or anyone who defended him to your apt for some longer amount of time, but in the end, when you're sure he learned from his mistake and should not go snooping about somebody else's apartment, especially when told not to, and messing with their animals, only then give him another chance.\n\nHis parents and your aunts and uncles are adults though, if I were you I'd write them off until they apologize for shouting at you.", "NTA.

You have to remind people to always do something rather than wait and see.", "Diffused responsibility under social psychology", "It's really common in Arizona because almost every house there comes with a pool.", "So it was an Old World tarantula that indirectly contributed to the prevalence of giant spiders in fantasy literature by biting a South African toddler back in the 1890s,  who always denied he was an arachnophobe but anyone who's read The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, and the Silmarillion has cause to doubt this.", "I\u2019d burn my house down before I let a spider in there. I don\u2019t even like the ones I know are there but are hiding, there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m allowing one to live with me lol", "I hate having spiders near me but I actually love looking at pictures of them. I find them fascinating to watch from a safe distance. I'd probably lose my mind if I was in a room with a tarantula though. \n\nA few years back my family was staying on our boat at a marina with covered slips while they were doing pest control and we ended up with a ridiculous number of spiders on our boat. I'll usually sit and watch them before I get rid of them. But my rule is generally that if it's big enough that I immediately know it's a spider, its gotta die haha. \n\nOne time there was a huge wolf spider in my basement on the door I intended to leave through. I was afraid to go near it and my grandma told me to get a shoe and she took care of it. Afterward, she goes \"baby, I've lived with scorpions, this was nothing!\"", "Get the flame thrower!", "Bloody hell, be a bit less of a high and mighty reactionary.\n\nETA LOL I'm blocked. How pathetic.", "Ah ok...tarantulas and snakes, I guess I view as dangerous.  Thank you for correcting :)", "Learn to read", "My two 8 year old grandkids know better.  And wouldn\u2019t do that at their own home, certainly not at a relatives home!   NTA.", "Not sure which country you live in but you can get locks fitted for rooms you want people to stay out of.", "You know how kids are, heck, we were all kids at one time, so at least you get it. Why are you so much in the minority of parents that actually watch your kids? Thanks for the response, btw.", "and lots of drunk people LOL", "Real grownups dont act like children are gods", "Having the pets inside their enclosure, behind a closed door, and in a room on a separate level of the house from the entertaining area should be more than secure enough to have family over for dinner.", "The more adults in a room, the less direct supervision children will get. An offshoot of bystander effect.", "And I maintain - why install locks when watching or properly raising your child will do?", "I'm always sharing this advice with everyone I know.  You have to point at someone and order them to call 911 as most people don't want to be involved or think someone else is doing it.", "Yup!  My Grandma was fond of da rice paddle!  But seriously, one of my earliest memories is standing and pointing at something and saying \"pretty\".   I  hear my mom say, \"yes, but we look and don't touch.\"  My boys were taught the same.", "OP doesn't say her tarantula was molting, just that the worms could have been dangerous if it had been molting, which is why you wouldn't leave a ton of worms in the enclosure for the spider to hunt at leisure.  That's a reason to clean out the enclosure and sift through the substrate.  However, the rest of the time, the superworms are the spider's food.  Just not in such large quantities.", "Holding your kid responsible for disobeying and abusing an animal is \"communism\" now?  You are deranged.", "i think he\u2019s trying to equate me being a communist and agreeing with OP, to the evils of communism?? i think??"]}
