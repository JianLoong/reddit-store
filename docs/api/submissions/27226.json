We decided to split everything in order to keep our expenses low. I love to cook, and he knew this from the start. I cook chicken, steak, pork, pancakes, ham, raman, etc... As soon as I cooked food for the first time in the house, he asked me if I could leave the window open. I understood, and I obliged. After about 2-3weeks of being fully moved in, he insisted I open the sliding back door as well. He asked a little more directly, but still somewhat politely. He just doesn't like the smell of cooking. So I obviously respected that since we share the space.\n\n Fast forward about a month or two, I foget to leave the sliding door open, but still have the kitchen window open. He comes down the stairs and slams the door open and says \"Open the Fucking door when you cook!\". Then he stomps back upstairs. I was quit shocked that he was that angry, especially since it was mearly just an accident. \n\nHe the comes home one day with plastic bags and tape. He proceeds to tape every vent up in the house, just so he can try avoiding the smell of cooking. The house starts looking like a nut house. He gets more distant and short tempered when I cook food. U\n\n Eventually we both get into relationships and our SO's move in with us. My bf and I start cooking, and so does his bf. He gets more and more upset. He would stomp downstairs when we cook and slam the sliding door and/or window open fully, even if its like 90% open. Followed by a \"open the fucking door/window!\". My bf and I decided to even invest in a $60 snail fan to help blow the scent out quicker. \n\nFinally, one day I had a very long day at work, and I got home pretty late. I cooked a steak around 10pm, ate, and then went to bed. While I was at work the day after, he asked if I could start cooking only outside. Which I refused, because I've done nothing but try and try to be respectful as possible, but I still need to eat. It's a house we both pay an equal amount for. I am going to cook in my own house. He starts to argue and says he can't get any sleep at night without a clean shirt over his face and that all of his clothes are starting to smell like steak (his room isnt even close to the kitchen.)\n\nWell when I get home, i find that all of the burners are off the stove. The stove was disconnected from the gas and powered off. He hid them and refused to give them back, and told me I'm only cooking outside from now on. I told him not everyone can survive off of avocados, peanuts, berries, and beef jerky. He just became smug as if he won, even though I did everything I could to respect the fact he didn't  like the smell. AITA? \n\n\ntldr: My roommate doesn't like the smell of cooking. So he took the burners off the stove and disconnected the gas because I refused to cook outside.", "created_utc": 1695148970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16myupt/aita_for_cooking_steak_in_my_house/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does he have trouble with smells in public? I'm guessing he can't go to restaurants or take his breaks in a communal area at work if his disgust is that acute. He should probably be seeing a therapist to try and work on this issue because it's going to be affecting his quality of life.

I only ask because there was a year where my fiance was living upstairs of a main floor/basement duplex and the elderly Chinese man living below her cooked with a lot of oil/grease that tended to have a bit of a stale/burned smell that would waft up through the vents. It wasn't overly bad and we could have just sucked it up, but putting air filters in the vents solved the smell issue entirely.\n\nIf it's all kinds of foods across multiple ethnicities and styles, so long as it's not constantly burnt it shouldn't be a problem.
