It doesn't matter how old you are, you can be nice to people just so you feel good about how you interacted with the world. Maybe nice is the wrong word, let's go with civil. \n\nIf you need to get a point across the only way is civility. We can't realistically expect improvements to be made if we \"fight fire with fire,\" in any situation. That didn't seem to go very well for her, did it? They're still at square one but now they're upset with eachother.\n\nYou're right, this is real shit, so every effort should be made to remedy this situation as soon as possible. Yes, report the scam, but also help him u derstand that he shouldn't be giving access to his computer. Fighting just makes things take longer. She should have tried to patiently help him because he's old as fuck and doesn't understand what's going on.

Staying polite wouldn't have got her any further because it already hadn't worked.\n\nIts one thing to maintain politeness when someone you will never see again, like a waiter, is rude.\n\nIts another to expect someone to constantly maintain a facade of politeness with someone they live with who is constantly aggressive and misogynistic despite their incompetence. \n\nAge is not an excuse and the fact you are willing to give people a pass to mistreat others just because of their age doesn't make it the right thing to do. It just means you have convinced yourself it is. In a way its patronising to say an old person doesn't know better and must be given a pass.

I can, and have, calmly said to someone, \"I vehemently disagree with what you just said.\" Or my favorite, \"that's a weird thing to say,\" that one really makes the smile from the \"funny\" thing they said drop.\n\nI guess I just have some particularly difficult old people in my life, and my go-to with anyone of any age is \"agree to disagree.\" And as some other comments have mentioned, hes a cpa so he should know better, so it could be signs of dementia, which is another reason I personally wouldn't have yelled at him. I would have inserted myself by calling PayPal on my own by now. \n\nBut that's fine, I accept that the majority disagrees with me.

Yeah probably.", "Its not that you are wrong all together, but the expectation to maintain that polite facade through gritted teeth when you live with the person and they are sexist/homophobic/rasist/bigoted is too high to put on anyone. \n\nThe absence of conflict is not the same as the presence of happiness or peace.\n\nIt just means the person doing the politeness develops a stress ulcer and the rude person learns they can get away with it consequence free.", "NTA.
