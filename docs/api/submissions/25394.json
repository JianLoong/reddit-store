So we end up arguing that instead of the core issue. Or we used to until I caught on and generated enough \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d to not react. It\u2019s taken me decades.\n\nDon\u2019t be me.\n\nEdit to add a recent example: Angry about me calling out his cruel behavior one day, he silently (but noisily) swooped all of this bedtime things into the guest room. Including his toiletries. I the next morning he was apologetic and swooped all his things back into our room. Then the next evening, in his own head about who knows what (I likely didn\u2019t affirm his magnanimous gesture of moving back in with me) he repeated the previous swooping. Meh. I just observe the show. Big brouhaha for no emotional return.\n\nWell, he\u2019s taken to spending his days on the guest bed, reading, napping. And using the couple of decorative pillows behind his back, squished in half to prop himself up. I removed those from the bed so that they would remain nice for company. He can use his regular pillows for that purpose if he desires. \n\nWhen questioned about where the pillow disappeared, I explained that I prefer to keep the fancy pillows looking nice for company. He got pissy, of course and said that he would not use the (already) squished pillows on the sofa then. \n\nI told him he was using the every day sofa throw pillows (big, fluffy, comfy things) and that when company comes, I swap them out for the nicer pillows I store away. \n\nThe thing is, he knows this. He knows I have nice pillows and every day pillows. It\u2019s a little thing but it makes me feel better to have fresh, bright, I squished pillows rather than the daily dingy ones. Never been a big deal. \n\nExcept when he wants to start WWIII over something I never said I needed or wanted. \n\nSadly, I engaged. And I\u2019m still kicking myself. I should have either ignored that tantrum or said, \u201cOk.\u201d But I argued to try to stand up for myself, \u201cI never said that\u2026.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t be me. Disengage yourself. Find joy.", "NTA - I'm always amazed at posts where they are engaged and it's glaringly obvious they cannot communicate in an adult manner.\n\nDo not get married unless you can talk about the tough stuff and argue in a way that isn't damaging!", "*I always hated these kind of gestures because they feel like tests. I ended up caving in and returning her ring to her every time, usually with apologies and some reconciliation, but the gesture always felt like a low blow and I always felt a bit weak for responding to them.*\n\nDon't blame you. As a woman, I think this kind of behavior is acceptable ONCE. Sadly, commitment is dangerous emotionally, so I think to certain extent it's alright to test your SO somewhat - but not on a regular basis and not as means of manipulation.\n\n*Anyways, I still hate these gestures and forms of argument. She (...) doesn't believe me when I tell her when her attempts at of mind reading are completely and utterly wrong (generally about 50% of the time).*\n\nListen to me.\n\nThis is a huge red flag. Almost everything she is doing is skirting the line of acceptable, except this and the test gestures. If you say \"no, that's not how I see that\" she doesn't get to insist you're wrong.\n\nI personally had an experience with a guy that he was not self aware of emotions during conflict. I could see he felt something, he denied it. Eventually I lost patience and started asking him questions about his reaction and stuff, so he eventually would be able to see. He ended up agreeing with me; several hours or days after arguing he would realize I was right for what I saw in that specific moment and he acknowledged that. So while she has no right to insist she knows better than you what you think, I think it's obvious she is sensing your confused and nuanced emotions about her. Doesn't matter - she chose the worst possible way to respond. By trying to control you.\n\nYou care about her, but you're also quite done with her shitty behavior.\n\nAnd her behavior shows all marks of a woman who doesn't feel loved on some level.\n\nAnd while that sucks - this is not the way to address it. Everything she is doing is just not productive.\n\nYou're not the asshole. You have every right to feel sad and tired even if you're doing shit wrong in the relationship, because those are not the ways to solve it. Even  if the problems you're making or you're doing something wrong, she is not entitled to this reaction. No, she has a responsibility of responding exactly the correct way to not exacerbate the issue further.\n\nBut what strikes me most about your description is that this is a behavior of a woman who feels she is not getting what she wants out of this relationship while at the same time this is the man she wants. She is trying to make you tweak your behavior, and to certain extent, that is alright in a relationship. And emotional intelligence is a huge deal - we can't always tell you openly what we want you to do, because the whole point is that you care and think about us and reconstruct situation to understand us - so you arrive yourself to understanding what reaction we need. Understanding, being understood, what is the drive, what are nuances, what are conflicts in our minds, comprehension of all that - not accepting it, just seeing it - is one of the greatest emotional needs many women have.\n\nShe sounds like this is what she is missing.\n\nI think counselling is good, but you need to adjust on communication. If you're still willing to put in work, that is. Assuming you are, you need to ask questions until the whole deal is transparent to you. Explain to her that you want this to be a mature conversation - you understand you're annoying her and she finds you disrespectful and manipulative - but you're truly not malicious. You truly are not doing this on purpose. Please. Have patience for me for an hour like I am super stupid and explain things to me when I ask them. Please refrain from shouting or saying mean things - I am trying to understand both of us.\n\nAnd then keep asking. Make her speak respectfully or conversation is done. You want to arrive to the point where she handles her anger and says something along these lines: \"I just feel so unloved, so frustrated, all things you're doing make me feel almost abandoned emotionally, while to you, you're just trying to set your boundaries. On one hand I know you're not being malicious, but on the other hand when I see how you're responding, it just makes me feel so angry because it feels like deliberate neglect or ignorance.\"\n\n**And you go:** \"Ok. Got it. Because we already have been through that, I want to explain something to you. When you left the wedding ring and told me to bring it back when I am ready for marriage, this was humiliating. I understand you felt desperate, but, please, hear me out - this is a power move. And while I care about you and want us to be together, you cannot approach me this way. You cannot have this attitude with me that you can just maneuver me into a corner - I understand you did out of emotional needs. I promise this is not about neglecting your needs, I want to meet them. Whatever you wanted to accomplish by that, I want to do - but not this way. So to continue, these feel like tests. So on principle, they make me want to defy you. I care about you - no, look - I care about you, but a gesture like that literally blocks me from being able to show you how much I care because it's so mean.\n\nI want you to think about what is happening right now. That I am not begging you to come back to our bedroom. I want you to understand it's not that I don't want you back, I am fighting for boundaries. When you behave like that, you're doing something unacceptable to me. If you feel unloved, if you want more, if I am not responding to you correctly, you have every right to express it, but healthily. When you act like that, you make me feel you're being malicious and that cannot be how a relationship functions. Also, you made me feel completely invalidated. We had arguments, you spoke, and when I responded you immediately ignored what I had to say. Again, I understand you feel pushed to this behavior because you feel that I  messed up so much - but that's the thing. Tell me. Without the \"manipulative, disrespectful\" and guessing what I am thinking, tell me how specific behavior of mine made you feel. Don't call out my behavior, name your feelings. Don't attach a label to me, attach a label to specific things that even an idiot would understand. And once you explain that to me, give me an example what behavior would have met your needs, what behavior from me would've made you happy.\n\nBut don't let this be twisted - I will not be controlled. You're with a man, not a puppet. You picked me because of who I am and who I can be. I believe people get together to make someone the best version of themselves - not in terms of job or pleasing others, not even pleasing partners, but to be the best me and the best you. You doing these stunts absolutely blocks that. And shows lack of respect. And that cannot fly. You cannot tell me what I think. We can argue about me or you not being self aware or correctly labeling thoughts or emotions, but you have no right to tell me I am not thinking or feeling something, or that this is what I think and feel. Just like I have zero right to do these to you.\n\nLastly, I understand we're not together only a few months, but you have to treat me with the same respect you would show to a stranger. If you're not capable of that, I have no reason to stay in this relationship. I want to meet your innermost needs, I want to be your everything - but you cannot manipulate me like a sheep into that. It needs to happen through communication and this communication has to be respectful and considerate. If you can't argue with me like we're not arguing against each other, but for each other, this is pointless. At the end of the day being together means we are fighting to stay together. So we have the same goal. So it's not about winning a fight or leaving the room in a huff after having the final word. If you can't understand this, I can't do this. I am perfectly happy with working with you on changing this behavior if the reason you act like this is not desire to control, but fear of intimacy. But you have to show me respect and consideration every step of the way. If that is something you feel like would compromise you too much, that's insane.

It's absolutely just my suggestion, I can be wrong on one point or all. This is just how I read the situation emotionally. She is trying to control you. And you let her a little bit and she lost some respect for you, so now she is pushing to control you more. While it's selfish, it doesn't matter if it's right or wrong, because it's ineffective.

Call off the proposal, move in to separate housing, go to counseling as a couple and then consider proposing again if you think you can work as a team.

It was always when he would speak to me in a way that honestly made me feel like I was a kid again being spoken to unkindly by my parents and I had to put myself in time-out.

Evidence being that you think it\u2019s your fault as to why she\u2019s like this. \n\nI\u2019ve been there before, with the ex I spoke about. All the arguments I used to think were my fault and now looking back on them it was always him. I\u2019d question him about these things I observed (he was cheating on me) and he ended up getting angry at me and saying this was my fault that was my fault and I\u2019d end up believing it and I\u2019d apologise. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m projecting, but I see me in you.

She wants you to come running to her apologising every single time. She\u2019s a grown ass woman and she won\u2019t sleep in a bed just because you bought it. If she is projecting her trauma onto you, she needs a buttload of therapy to work on that to not take it out on other people. It\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure she\u2019s mentally well though. You\u2019re only responsible for your own mental health. \n\nWill she really change?

By what you described, that sounded incredibly hard. \n\nThe truth is, my mental health has been suffering significantly. I've had to get onto antidepressants lately after ideations started popping up for the first time in 15 years. \n\nI don't think I can wait for the amount of time she would need to overcome these issues. Part of the problem is that she is sensing my thoughts about breaking things off and is displaying her worst self during this uncomfortable time of uncertainty. \n\nI am delaying because we live together, have pets together, have loved each other for years. She has no savings, no support network, no full time job, and she is too proud to accept any financial help from me if we break things off.

She causes all these problems and expects you to get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness. That\u2019s control.

She would try to convince me that I am vastly misrepresenting her actions and intentions, at which point she would claim that I'm only trying to find excuses for breaking things off, which would be just true enough to make me doubt. \n\n... But point taken.", "I meant making gestures like sleeping on the floor of the guest room, to 'give you the space you obviously need' or whatever her reason was.
