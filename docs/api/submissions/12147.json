My roommate is complaining that my bf is staying over too often and I think she\u2019s being unreasonable.", "selftext": "Final edit* I stopped replying to comments because I\u2019m having to repeat the same thing over and over SO - one last time I will say that this has only been going on for the last month and a half (almost month and three weeks). I\u2019ve counted, and it\u2019s been ten times in the past month and half that he has stayed with me. He has only stayed with me three times since March started, only on the weekends. When he comes over, it is always in the evening when we are coming home from bars, after spending the entire day working on his house, and he leaves first thing in the morning to continue working on reno. It might be hard to believe, but we are almost never in shared spaces. Truly almost NEVER. The man really is just there to have a roof over his head while he sleeps. \n\nEdit** I said he sometimes works from my place on weekdays, but it has been maybe three Fridays, I am always home on those Fridays, because I work part time, and my roommate is not home because she also has a job. \n\nEdit 2** my boyfriend is pretty much only actually at the apartment at night so that we can sleep; the only real space he is taking up is in my bed.\n\nEdit 3** my roommate, and I have had multiple discussions about my boyfriend staying over a little more frequently at night, and every single time she has maintained that it does not bother her. \n\nEdit 4** he got this house so we can move in together. He will have floors in his house by the end of March, and will no longer need to stay with us as often. My lease is up in June, and I will move into the house with him.\n\nI (22f) have lived with my roommate (24f) for about two years. My bf (28m) and I have been together since before my roommate and I moved in together. Currently, he lives an hour away from me, a couple towns over. About a month and a half ago, he was able to purchase a house in my town and has been renovating it. As is, it is unlivable. There are no floors in the entire house, so staying there is not an option. It also doesn\u2019t make sense for him to drive the hour back home when I live two minutes from the new house. Today, my roommate texted me and said she wants to have a conversation about how often he\u2019s been staying over. Over the past month and a half, he has stayed over about two nights a week on average. Sometimes three nights, sometimes one. It is almost always during the weekend. He is repairing the house during the day, and we will go out at night or sometimes chill at my place after. Maybe 3-4 times TOTAL during this entire month and a half, he has worked from my apartment (he works from home) on a week day (it\u2019s usually a Friday) but he always works in my room so as to not take up our shared space, such as the kitchen table. I am also always home when he is there. I have my own room and bathroom, so he isn\u2019t taking any of her personal space whatsoever. I will also mention that our utility bills have NOT increased whatsoever during this time - I checked. Who is the a**hole here? Am I wrong to think she\u2019s be unreasonable? This hasn\u2019t ever been a problem during the last two summers for example, where he stayed most weekends after going to the beach and hanging with friends. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s suddenly an issue now. \n\nSide note: I go to see him at his place all the time (usually at least once a week) and have complained to my roommate on many occasions that I wish he\u2019d come to me one or two nights a week so I don\u2019t have to drive as much, so I\u2019ve been extremely happy that the new house means he comes to me more. She has always agreed that he should come to me more so I don\u2019t have to drive constantly, and now that he\u2019s doing just that, it\u2019s an issue?!", "created_utc": 1678650999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11po34q/aita_my_roommate_is_complaining_that_my_bf_is/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You walk around relaxed then suddenly he\u2019s there and you have to socialise. You walk into the kitchen and they are both there, you feel unwanted in your own home. It feels suffocating and invasive. YTA", "Yta, and how many times are you going to change how often he's over? You're the worst liar and terrible at keeping a story straight. Basically he's over way more than you're letting on", "YTA, and very selfish.", "YTA for not talking to her first and deciding \"what's reasonable for her\" by yourself. There is a difference in how you feel when someone else is over vs. having your place to yourself (or with the roommate you picked).  \n\nShe didn't choose to live with him, but she's now having to deal with it 20% of the time and maybe never knows when he's around? I'd be on edge too.", "Yes YTA and your defensive comments to people here aren\u2019t helping. When your roommate told you her feelings the right way to respond is to say sorry, you didn\u2019t mean to make her uncomfortable and have a conversation where you ask her what she would be ok with. It doesn\u2019t matter that in the past she\u2019s said she wasn\u2019t bothered. Instead of going with the mature response you\u2019ve decided to respond by being defensive. Luckily for your roommate it sounds like you\u2019ll be moving out soon, and I hope if she has future roommates that they\u2019ll be more mature and understanding than you", "YTA - here's the thing - being a third wheel in your own house *sucks.*\n\nShe's allowed not to like it, she's allowed to ask for a decrease. She moved in with one woman, not a romantic couple. She got the option to choose you, her flatmate - but only you got to choose who you date. See what I'm saying? It doesn't matter why - if it's too much for her - you need to come to a reasonable compromise.\n\nAlso having lived with couples before, the utilities are not the main thing, even when splitting costs comes up. Think about it this way. If it was me and a flatmate staying in on a Friday night, I can pull up a seat at the dinner table / plonk myself on the sofa, and relax. If I'm living with a couple, and they stay in on a Friday night, their 'night in' is couple time, it's date night. The chance of me going to my room is high, and the chance of me chilling in the kitchen or living room *which I pay 50% for* is slimmer. Is that fair? \n\nAsk yourself - does she appear in the communal spaces *less* when your BF is around? Or does she get the house to herself in the way she would have naturally if you were working your usual schedule and BF wasnt in town? These things matter more than utilities.", "YTA - you dont get to decide how often she is comfortable with your boyfriend staying over. \n\nGiven how you knew the frequency of his visits was going to be increasing, you should have talked to her about this, asked if she was cool with it, and he should be contributing financially in some way.", "YTA 12 nights a month more than (1/3) is enough in some rental agreements to consider him a tenant. \n\nBoo hoo you need to drive instead of making him drive. Life isn't all about you and what you want, what is convenient for you. \n\nSounds like it's time to move in with your bf since you're complaining about not being able to do more than 4 nights together.", "YTA You're roommate did not sign a lease to share her space with your boyfriend.", "YTA - 2 to 3 nights a week out of 7 on avg is nearly half a tenant...\n\nDoesn't matter if they're only in your room (prob not 100% I'm guessing) they are still in the unit and that means they don't get much privacy and adds to their stress level, which they should have a level of peace in their home.", "YTA, it's not cool that your roommate has to expect that he's going to be spending the night pretty much every weekend. The fact that's convenient for him to stay doesn't supercede her right to be comfortable. Even with a private bathroom and bedroom, it can still be an uneasy vibe knowing someone else is in the apartment. Having guests over is a privilege, not a right!", "Your edits tell me that you came here thinking that Reddit was going to validate you and reinforce that you are not TA, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be happening so you\u2019re fighting the wave of YTAs. \n\nYou are definitely the asshole. Your BF doesn\u2019t live there and doesn\u2019t pay rent but spends enough time in your house that your roommate is clearly annoyed and uncomfortable.", "YTA. Your roommate agreed to have one roommate, you, not you and your boyfriend. If she thinks your boyfriend is at the apartment too much, he is.", "YTA, she has one roommate not two.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if you understand or not. The fact is your roommate doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with your boyfriend staying over so much and you need to respect that. It\u2019s the downside of having a roommate. You can talk to her and try to compromise with the number of days, but as shocking as it might seem to you, a lot of people aren\u2019t comfortable with someone that doesn\u2019t live in their place always hanging around.", "YTA. You told your roommate this is what's happening. You didn't ask. I've never seen a rental agreement that allows more than 5 days per month without the new person needing a background check from the landlord", "YTA I think you should offer to pay 20% more in rent & utilities to cover your BF staying over & that it will just be until his house is ready.   Then they may feel that they get something positive to make up for the negative.", "YTA for being upset that your roommate wants to talk to you about this situation. Plus you say that he's only there one or two nights but then he also works from there during the week some days. That sounds like he's staying there more than you think he is regardless of whether or not the bills increase. You also have to think about this from your roommate's perspective. If she knows that he is currently renovating an unlivable home 2 mins from your apartment his increase in staying over and starting to work there might seem like you two are trying to subtly move him in so he doesn't have to drive an hour back to his old place. While that may not be your intention, if you haven't had a conversation with her I don't blame her for wanting to have one.", "YTA. \n\nI was in a sort of a similar situation. My husband and I rented out our spare room to a single girl when we had advertised it for a couple at a more expensive rate( we live in a seasonal tourist town so housing is competitive). The single girl seemed nice so we dropped the rent down and had her move in thinking one less person to live with would be nice. She got a bf. She never ever asked if it was ok to have him over. He was staying 2, 3 nights a week. I felt like I could not use any of the common areas because I did not feel comfortable having a strange man in my house that we had not gotten to know.  It was absolutely f$@*-#. \n\nYour roommate I have no doubt is feeling as uncomfortable as I was. Even if he is just in your room she knows he's there so cannot fully relax. She is obviously not comfortable with your bf so it is a problem therefore YTA.", "YTA. Your roommate agreed to living with *you*, not you and your boyfriend. Him being there a couple days a week, working from there and sleeping there is a lot and she is entitled to be uncomfortable with it.", "YTA, he\u2019s not paying to be there and your roommate is, this is much her house as it is yours and you have to understand that you cant have him around that much cause SHE IS ALSO LIVING THERE, your boyfriend is not and not on the lease so he has no say in being there, your roommate does", "Depending how often he's over you might also be violating your lease agreement, which could put you both at risk of being evicted.", "YTA, big time. Everyone is saying YTA and yet you try to justify it or rationalize it. YTA and seemingly an inconsiderate roomate as well, there\u2019s no way around that.", "YTA. If you\u2019re in the States, standard lease language limits the number of nights per month a guest can stay over before the landlord needs to be informed. It may be your roommate is worried about exceeding this number and possibly losing the lease.", "YTA. If there were constantly a stranger in my house against my will I\u2019d be very sad. I\u2019d feel trapped in my own room.", "Doesn't matter if the utilities increase, he should put some money into the pot", "YTA", "YTA. That\u2019s the problem with roommates. Although you pay rent so do they and you are not entitled to anything that makes the other uncomfortable. She may have been fine before but she\u2019s clearly not anymore so you need to cut that shit out until you move or make other arrangements. Sucks but that\u2019s life with a roommate.", "OP, get your story straight. Is it 3-4 times a month or average twice a week (average 8 times a month)? Because your story is just not lining up right now. \n\nAlso, what's up with the lack of communication with your roommate? You haven't even heard her out before deciding that she's being unreasonable here. She literally just wants to have a conversation about it. And about how she has said in the past that she agrees that your boyfriend should go over to see you more. For one, she can change her opinion/stance on consenting to have him over at any time. Just because you say something once doesn't mean it applies forever. Also, did she ever specify that she for sure was okay with him to be over at your apartment every time he visited? Because it doesn't really sound like it.", "YTA. \n\nOffer to pay more to make things even or get your own place together. She didn\u2019t sign a lease with him too", "So have a conversation with her about what\u2019s going on?", "You sound really entitled. I\u2019d hate to be your roommate. YTA.", "YTA. Your asking Reddit and you complained about the answers, why even ask? You just want to hear what you wanted to hear and that\u2019s probably why your roommate just \u201cagreed\u201d with you when  you complained on how much driving you had to do to just to see him\u2014just to shut you up. You\u2019re the only one who wanted to be with your boyfriend, obviously she\u2019s not comfortable having your bf constantly in the apartment, and she didn\u2019t sign up for a roommate +1.", "YTA. I think a big part of the problem is, you just can\u2019t admit when you\u2019re wrong.

That\u2019s the only important thing here.", "YTA, underpinned by the additional comments posted in the thread. You have asked Reddit for an opinion on the situation, and seem to be arguing with the answer and not considering things from your roommates perspective at all. You\u2019ve not asked her if she was comfortable with him staying over so much, you told her. Not the same thing. You\u2019ve vented about driving so far to visit him before he got his new place, she was understanding but by the sounds of it did not suggest he stay with you.", "YTA 100%. Your roommate signed up to have 1 roommate, not 2, even if he stays in your room.", "YTA. When you're having him over this often per week, cancel the current lease with your roommate, and do a lease agreement WITH him somewhere else. She chose you as a flatmate initially. It is making her uncomfortable as heck with how frequent it's become of. She needs privacy and your trust. Obviously broken already. Move out already.", "OP read all of your edits, and guess what YTA", "Why do you need to be around your bf that much? Like, if you're spending more than 50% of your time with him, move in with him. Seriously, it's your roommate's place too. Imagine not being able to feel comfortable in your own home because your roommate is one of those people who can't be without their SO for more than a day. Just get married and move in together if you're needing to be around each other that much.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nShe has a right to feel comfortable in her home; clearly she's not happy with this arrangement. \n\nThat said...this is a unique situation, where he's renovating a house. But is the end in sight? Sit down with her and work out what is and isn't acceptable as far as boyfriends staying over.", "gentle yta. Her feelings about it changed once she experienced it for a while. That's an important thing to listen to and figure out how to make it work for everyone.  People aren't machines.  Sometimes they try to be helpful before knowing how a situation will affect them.  You have to be flexible and communicate about her issues with it.\n\nIf you and your boyfriend are occupying the apartment more than you used to, that's a noticeable change, and even if utilities stay the same he should chip something in towards rent, commensurate to the time he spends there.  (Divide the monthly rent by 30 (days in the month) and again by 3 (number of people in the apartment) to get the daily rent and then multiply by the average number of days he's there.). \n\nI really enjoy being totally alone in my apartment from time to time, and I'd be bummed if I was used to having some alone time and it vanished.  I don't know why being 100% alone is different than just people being in their rooms, but it is and I don't completely relax until I am completely alone.", "YTA. She\u2019s asking for a conversation\u2014hear out what she has to say. You could reach a compromise, don\u2019t prematurely think she\u2019s being unreasonable. Maybe you guys can go out on dates when he\u2019s around then come back later at night so she gets more alone time or something.\n\nI once lived in a 4bd/2ba living situation and one of the other girls boyfriends was always over. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal most of the time, but the second bath was an ensuite (not attached to my room) and gf and bf showered one after another so I had to go through another roommate\u2019s room to pee when they weren\u2019t there\u2026 it was obnoxious. Is there only one bath? If so that\u2019s a huge thing. Another is their screaming matches. They tried to reserve them for when no one else was home but it didn\u2019t always work that way.\n\nAlso, knowing nothing about your bf, I would be creeped out by a guy who dated a 19 or 20 year old when he was 25 or 26.", "I had a roommate whose boyfriend was a great guy. But he was over a lot. When he wasn\u2019t there I could go braless or I could walk around in my bra and panties; I could run to the bathroom topless if I wanted. When he was there, I felt like I couldn\u2019t be comfortable in my own place. Even if he was in her room, there was always the chance he would walk out at an inopportune moment. \n\n  \nYou need to talk to your roommate to find out what is bothering her. If she thinks he should be paying rent, see if there is an amount you can agree is fair. If she doesn\u2019t want him working there, see if there is some other place, like a library or a friend\u2019s place he can work from. Were you spending more time with her before he was around so much? Talk it out and see if you can set aside some regular time to get together. She could be feeling sad or insecure that you will be moving in with him soon, leaving her in the dust. This could make her feel resentful of him. Is he parking somewhere that is putting her out?

My bf (28m) and I have been together since before my roommate and I moved in together. Currently, he lives an hour away from me, a couple towns over. About a month and a half ago, he was able to purchase a house in my town and has been renovating it. As is, it is unlivable. There are no floors in the entire house, so staying there is not an option. It also doesn\u2019t make sense for him to drive the hour back home when I live two minutes from the new house. Today, my roommate texted me and said she wants to have a conversation about how often he\u2019s been staying over. Over the past month and a half, he has stayed over about two nights a week on average. Sometimes three nights, sometimes one. It is almost always during the weekend. He is repairing the house during the day, and we will go out at night or sometimes chill at my place after. Maybe 3-4 times TOTAL during this entire month and a half, he has worked from my apartment (he works from home) on a week day (it\u2019s usually a Friday) but he always works in my room so as to not take up our shared space, such as the kitchen table. I am also always home when he is there. I have my own room and bathroom, so he isn\u2019t taking any of her personal space whatsoever. I will also mention that our utility bills have NOT increased whatsoever during this time - I checked. Who is the a**hole here? Am I wrong to think she\u2019s be unreasonable? This hasn\u2019t ever been a problem during the last two summers for example, where he stayed most weekends after going to the beach and hanging with friends. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s suddenly an issue now. \n\nSide note: I go to see him at his place all the time (usually at least once a week) and have complained to my roommate on many occasions that I wish he\u2019d come to me one or two nights a week so I don\u2019t have to drive as much, so I\u2019ve been extremely happy that the new house means he comes to me more. She has always agreed that he should come to me more so I don\u2019t have to drive constantly, and now that he\u2019s doing just that, it\u2019s an issue?!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Have the conversation.", "YTA - and probably violating the terms of your lease", "I see your edits and let me just throw in. \n*It doesn\u2019t matter if you think he\u2019s not there too much*, she does and she is your room mate.

If it is literally that he's just sleeping there I don't see a problem.\n\nI would ask her why it is a problem. Is it that she hears you being intimate or he snores and it impacts her sleep or makes her feel uncomfortable? Or is it that you two would usually spend time together at the weekend and that she feels she's losing you as a friend? \n\nIf it is this kind of problem then there could be other solutions, as flatmates you do have to reach a compromise and it isn't fair to make someone feel uncomfortable in their own home.", "You asked if you were an asshole. Pretty much everyone said yes. You refuted a lot of it and took nothing anyone said on board. I'm glad your roommate will no longer have to live with you soon enough.", "YTA. My sister would have her bf over almost EVERY SINGLE NIGHT/DAY. I couldn't walk around in my sports bras in the summer. I couldn't be out in the kitchen when they were. It sucked.

I'm sure she would like to spend weekends without your boyfriend there.", "When you signed a lease together, were you clear that your BF would be staying there 33% of the time?  (10 days/month per your post)   And did your roommate say \"that sounds great, let me pay 50% of rent and utilities so I can feel like the 3rd wheel in the apartment\"?\n\nBTW, the fact that your BF is renovating his place and can't live there is NOT your roommate's problem.  This is unfair to her. YTA.", "Maybe she jealous of your relationship and know she is going to lose you soon .", "Bingo. It's even just passing the bf in the hall.

And you\u2019re acting like she\u2019s unreasonable when you haven\u2019t even had a conversation. You\u2019ve already made her the villain in the story and acting like she\u2019s asking for too much. Maybe be an adult and talk to your roommate and stop acting like you and your boyfriends needs are the most important in the apartment.

You do not own the apartment, you share it with your roommate.\nTherefore any guests situation should be discussed and agreed upon. And you know what? She can change her mind. Maybe she wants to lounge around in her underwear and with your bf there she does not feel comfortable doing so. The moment she tells you she wants him over less and his presence makes her uncomfortable, that should be it.\n\nLet it sink in : YTA. Grow up and be a decent human.

Did he anticipate you offering your place because its closer BEFORE you spoke to your roommate? Did you agree to it when he was making plans to buy the house but never even hinted at it to your roommate?\n\nDid you take any of that into account before hand or did you just expect her to go with it because \"he cant live in his new house and he has to drive an hour away otherwise\" \n\nThat sounds like a HIM problem that YOU should have notified your roommate about.", "Why post on AITA if you\u2019re unwilling to even try to see the other perspective?", "Because it's not just yours, and it's almost guaranteed to be a violation of your lease to have him over that much", "Because she pays for it, too.", "Do one weekend at your place. One weekend at his. It\u2019s not that hard.", "Why is it all or nothing with this?  Your roommate seems to have tolerated it without complaint until you began bringing him over many times more often (going from the occasional weekend night to up to 3 days a week, including weekdays).  Be a better roommate and cut back to something reasonable.

From all the YTAs I think you should gather that loads and loads and loads of people can think of many reasons why 2 nights (occasional 3) are too many. Why do you think we all see why she has a right to have a problem with it, even though you keep on justifying the math? Really think about that. \n\nb) doctors have a rule of thumb which is basically - patients downplay things a huge amount. The 40 a day smoker only admits to 20 a day - so if a patient appears saying '20' the doctor presumes the truth is '30+'. Now, with all due respect,  you are looking for a diagnosis, and we are being doctors. You telling us your bf is over 2 nights but that he doesn't go to the communal areas and he stays in your room and she doesn't see him and she barely hears him and he only sleeps and it couldn't affect her anyway. I find this hard to swallow. Because we're all unreliable narrators when it suits us, and also because you probably don't feel his presence the same way she does. She might have info / interactions with him which you don't know about, because they happened in the 5 minutes it took him to get a glass of water. You count that as 'barely being there'. But if she was in the kitchen and, depending on what was said / how comfy she feels around him, she could HEAVILY count that on her list of why she doesn't like having him over. Which leads me to (take with a grain of salt) point c\n\nc) she could be uncomfortable with your bf being over, period. This would be annoying - you could move out - but she'd still be in the right. Because he didn't sign the lease. Simple. I'm gonna be blunt and say that she might not like your boyfriend. She might not like a man sleeping that often in her house. This is her right. Annoying that her opinion changed (when he started staying over - note. She went from a theoretical OK to the real situation and is saying no... this is not the point in your favour you think it is. ) but as others have said, he's over enough that a lot of landlords would probably like to know about it. Again - she didn't pick him. So she doesn't have to be ok with him being over.", "Is he taking showers there? Taking a shit and using toilet paper? You might not realize it but he\u2019s costing a bit to stay there. \n\nAnd there\u2019s no way in HELL I\u2019d be okay with him working remotely from home any day if I were the roommate. There\u2019s something going on here that you\u2019ve omitted. \n\nDid you even sit her down for a chat and ask her if she was okay with your boyfriend staying over more?

Thats all that matters here, shes not okay with it and its her space too and you have to respect that.", "I think you just want someone to agree with you. What clarity do you need? She says it's too much, deal with it.", "You're getting all the clarity you want but you don't agree so you're purposely being daft until you get an answer you want and or agree with. Yta. You're being childish and selfish be a big girl and have the adult conversation with your roommate. Also stick with one story because with how many times you changed things up it got confusing.", "That's already enough clarity for you to see that everybody here agrees that YTA.\nBut you keep trying to justify every answer with complicated math that doesn't add up, and always ending your answers with defensive laughing.", "Its common courtesy to ask someone youre living with if youre going to perpetually have a guest over - but thats not the situation we\u2019re in, as we\u2019re past that point.

She knows how frustrating and difficult and stressful that has been for me. It\u2019s only been a month that he has been staying over slightly more. He also needs to be here to repair his house.", "I mentioned that he sometimes works from my place on a Friday, but she is usually not even there when he is working. So it pretty much is limited to just weekends, usually Friday and Saturday night. We are usually out with friends when he isn\u2019t working on the house. It\u2019s literally just to sleep that he is at my place.

He needs to be there to work on his house, which he is doing frequently.\n2. They go out with friends and then only come back to \"sleep.\"\n3. He wont need to be there at the end of March because his house will have floors.\n\nSuper Sus!", "I think it\u2019s not that I want someone to agree with me, I more just don\u2019t understand why everyone is making it seem like I\u2019m not allowed to have my boyfriend over at my apartment. I pay bills exactly like she does, I never complain when she has friends over or guys over. She has been in long-term relationships in the past and they stayed over all the time.", "Definitely will! Especially after how rude people are swinging into this convo lol", "Then you should have no issue wanting to sit down with her and hear her perspective on things. Kind of weird you\u2019re already jumping down her throat without even talking to her if you are that secure in your friendship.", "The fact is, your roommate is telling you that she\u2019s unhappy and uncomfortable, and when people are pointing out that your boyfriend IS there excessively, your responses are pretty much an eye roll, whatever, it\u2019s not that bad.
