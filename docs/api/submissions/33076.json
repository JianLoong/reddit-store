Jay died when the kids were 5 and 7. Claire met her second husband Josh a year and a half later and they married when the kids were 8 and 10. Sadly, only days after their wedding Claire was diagnosed with terminal cancer and passed away five months later. Before her death she told me the kids wanted to live with me or my parents when she was gone and did not want to remain with Josh. She wanted me to take them because my parents had become incredibly messed up after we lost Jay and she was worried about the kids not being well taken care of. She told me she knew her Josh would raise them but the kids wanted their family and she wanted to make this as easy on them as possible. So I agreed and after Claire died the kids came to live with me and did not see Josh again.\n\nA few weeks ago Josh contacted me through social media.  He's on hospice and had apparently been thinking about Claire and the kids and he always regretted that the kids hadn't gotten close enough to him to want him raising them after Claire died. He said it would bring him some peace if he could see them again, even if it was only for a few minutes. He told me he felt like it was a tragedy how everything happened.\n\nI asked Leo and Cara if they would at all want or be willing to go see him. I made it clear there was no pressure but I wanted to give them the chance to decide. Neither of them wanted to go see Josh. I told them it was fine and I let him know that it would not be possible but I was sorry to hear how sick he was and I hoped he could find peace.\n\nHe replied to me a couple of days after my response and said he understood. Then a couple of days after that his brother and sister tell me how shitty it is that I wouldn't encourage the kids to go see him or make them go if I had to. They said their brother did his best while he was in their lives and they discarded him like trash. They said he will never get the chance to see them again, he'll be gone and I should be ashamed of my actions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702654352, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j2q7o/aita_for_refusing_to_force_my_niece_and_nephew_to/", "score": 980, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its not about kindness and empathy, it's about a near stranger asking them to his deathbead and them going: \"but we don't know you\"", "She said he wanted to stay in contact  but neither kid wanted thst", "She can't force them to go if they don't want to", "It wasn't that Claire didn't want him to raise them. The kids told her they wanted to be with family, with me or my parents, not with him. The kids did not love him or consider him family by the time their mom got sick, and not when she passed. So I do not feel bad for taking them. This was what the kids wanted and their feelings were always my priority. My brother would have wanted me to make sure I was always there to support the kids.", "he was hardly In there life's  he's a stranger they don't him owe anything", "Maybe you could do something for him like send him some pictures and an update on their lives?  And you could tell him that they said something nice.  It would be a kindness for a dying man.", "Info: Is there a reason you didn't keep up a relationship with Josh after their mom had died? Was there any conversation about him visiting on occasion, or was there just no interest on either side?", "From one of OP\u2019s comments, apparently Josh made it known that he would love to stay in contact but the kids didn\u2019t show an interest or specifically said they didn\u2019t want to so OP didn\u2019t encourage it. Basically, the same as now. They said no, so everyone dropped it.", "This, I know time can get away from you and kids grow up fast, but if he wanted to be part of their lives he could have made the effort to meet them.", "it's unfortunate, but not surprising. Josh couldn't have been around for more than years before your sil died. and given they spend half a year dealing with her declining health, it's not all shocking they didn't develop a relationship", "You are choosing a harsher connotation. He didn\u2019t invest in their lives and now they don\u2019t care. Cats in the Cradle and all that.", "Would it be possible to have them give him a call at least? I realize they don't have a current connection to him, and they've obviously been through a lot, but it's the kind of thing that you might regret not doing later on.", "I didn\u2019t say he was a monster. He had many opportunities to reach out and didn\u2019t until he was desperate. He is a stranger and they owe him nothing.", "They don't owe h anything they aren't selfish would u go vist a stranger", "I see where OP said the kids didn\u2019t want to live with him, but not where she said they wanted no contact.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m with this.", "What a great suggestion!  A kind gesture and a appropriate compromise for this situation.", "This would be nice without actually impacting the consent of the kids since OP is already the guardian. This story already has too many tragedies", "YES, THIS. The kids don't want to be faced  with death. Many cannot handle it.  This is very sad.", "Ah, I didn't see that. That does make it a little sad for him. Honestly he doesn't seem like an AH at all. If he wanted stay in the kids' lives but they didn't want that, it was right of him to accept this. He was also within his rights to ask if he could see them once more before he dies, and they were within their rights to decline, which he seems to have graciously accepted. I'd say his brother and sister are being tiny aholes but their brother is dying and they're probably upset.\n\nI'd go with NAH on this one.", "Oh that's a bit sad. IDK I probably would have invited him over a few times and had the kids hang out with him (with the rest of the family there). I know people disagree with this approach, but kids don't naturally want to build or keep up relationships with people, even people they like, it's just a lot of work and kids are very in the moment about things. That's usually why adults facilitate these things. But what's done is done now, NAH.", "They really don't want contact with him at all. Even a call. They never had a connection to him and I do not see them regretting this later. I have told them they can change their minds and I will help them if they do.

But you can only gently encourage which it seems you did....\n\nQuestion, did they tell you why they don't want to see him?", "NAH. People have a very idealized idea of what these reunions look like. They won't run in and hug him and tell him he's an awesome guy that they secretly always missed and admired. It will be awkward and awful. His siblings don't understand  that, which is normal. They want to do whatever they can for him. But this isn't the way. He isn't going to benefit from being hit with the reality that there never was a bond there and never will be, and the kids don't need more death in their lives. Forcing orphans to meet the emotional needs of a dying man they chose not to live with is beyond cruel.", "NTA. \n\nLeo and Cara are old enough to make their own decision about seeing Josh. \n\nIt would have been wrong to bully them into changing their minds.", "NTA!!  \nThose \"kids\" are now 16 and 18, certainly old enough to make their own decisions about something like this. It sounds like they never had time to get to know or bond with Josh. He is essentially a stranger to them. It's really nobody's fault, the timing just wasn't right.

There's something very painful about knowing you could have improved a dying person's last moments but chose not to, even if the reasons you chose not to were entirely valid.   \n\n\nThat's life though. No take-backs.", "Please offer your condolences to his family and then block Josh's brother, sister, and any of his relatives that may contact you.

I guess they are not familiar with trauma.", "YTA", "NTA. \n\nNot even close.   \n\n\nI can't imagine how traumatic that time must have been for your niece and nephew. And given how things developed, they likely never much of a relationship with Josh because they never had a chance to. Now he's simply now a reminder from a time in their lives when they were dealing with a lot of trauma. I don't blame them for not wanting to go. \n\nEven though they can't go, you might consider going to see him yourself and just talk about them, what they've done, and show him pictures of the kids, etc. It's above and beyond anything you're required to do but it would be a nice half way gesture.", "Could you do a short FaceTime visit? We did this for a family member and they were very happy with the solution.", "Maybe there is a reason the kids nor your sister wanted them to be with Josh.

He can contact and ask them himself.", "If your sister-in-law met her second husband a year and a half after your brother died, married him when her kids were 8 and 10, was diagnosed with a terminal disease days after her wedding, and died five months later, then your niece and nephew didn't know their step-father for very long before their mother died. \n\nIt's not like you could have forced your nephew to go see his step-dad, since he's 18.  If their step-dad wanted to see them and have a relationship with them, then where was he for the last 8 years?", "You did the right thing in the right way.  They are old enough to make their own decisions. The flying monkeys are not concerned with your niblings' feelings.  You have to be.  \n\n Sending photos is a good suggestion.", "NTA and I can sympathize with what Josh is going through but these kids haven\u2019t seen or kept in touch with him during the last 8 years.

Those kids didn\u2019t really have a chance to bond with their stepdad. Their world was rocked by TWO parent deaths, and the best thing was to be with family they knew very well. Transitioning into a blended family is already hard enough without losing one bio parent after the other. If the kids had been raised with their stepfather for five YEARS instead of months, it might\u2019ve been different. He was almost a stranger. You did exactly as you were supposed to do, OP. You told them but didn\u2019t pressure them, you were polite and kind about their denial, and you didn\u2019t shame their choice. It\u2019s a sad situation but you did what was right.", "NTA. The kids have no relationship with this man. They could have, yes, but that's not how things worked out. It doesn't sound like Josh tried to maintain a relationship, either, for whatever reason. You told the kids what was going on and gave them a choice with no pressure either way. Forcing them to go against their will would destroy their relationship with you, and I'm glad you never considered that an option. The kids made their choice and you respected it, that's the best way to handle this.\n\nJosh respected it, too. He was understandably upset, but he respected it, accepted it, and didn't push. I imagine he's told his family how disappointed and upset he is, but from what's here he doesn't sound like the type that would have asked them to change your and the kids minds. He was likely just looking for support from his family. His siblings had no right to contact you. The whole thing had already been dealt with properly and respectfully. Forcing the kids would be bad for Josh, as well, he'd know and he'd feel terrible for putting them in that position. His last days should be as happy and peaceful as possible, not full of guilt at hurting these kids. The siblings getting their way would be bad for everyone.\n\nIf they contact you again, tell them you're not prepared to cause harm to your niece and nephew *or Josh* just because they think what they want is more important than what the kids want or what Josh needs. \n\nSend Josh a pic of the kids, something recent, showing how well they're doing, so he has something to remember them and his ex from. Let him know that this is more about him being a stranger to them now than anything. Don't bring up his siblings actions, but say you hope he's got the support and care he needs and that you're thinking of him. Then refuse contact with anyone calling on Josh's behalf.", "NTA. You, your niece, and your nephew are not responsible for other people's peace. Respect their decision and the widower's family needs to respect their decision as well.

This IS tragedy all around.", "It's been like ten years of no contact. They've suffered two very significant deaths in their short lives and they are guilting you and shaming the children because a) they don't feel any connection to him and b) quite frankly don't need to be put through another emotional rollercoaster of seeing someone else dying. Just say you are not going to take their comments to heart because they are obviously going through a lot right now but the children have been through enough, don't need to go through more and are old enough to make their own decisions. Then block them.", "NTA. What would maybe be nice is telling Josh and his family that you understand why he might want to reach out to the kids but the relationship was not significant enough for them AND that it is nothing to regret! The situation WAS a tragedy but nobody did anything wrong here. It is nobody's fault that their relationship didn't develop in the time that they had, and also not unusual. There is nothing for you OR the kids OR Josh to feel badly about. His family is grieving and so is he and they are just trying to make sure nothing is left unsaid.", "Why is everyone in this story dying??? JK Rowling, is that you?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids need to be your priority. And THEY made their choice.", "NTA they only knew him for a few months some years ago. They are old enough to have autonomy over their own decisions. I feel bad that he overestimated his importance to them, but waiting until his deathbed is too late. Death isn't a blanket excuse to subject others to mending one's regrets. It's manipulative and selfish. \n\nHis family is emotional due to his passing. They don't know you or the children from a random dude off the street. They can feel the way they do, but they are delusional.", "NTA. It was good of Josh to accept the 2 children when he married their mother. But they\u2019ve been traumatized enough by their parents\u2019 deaths. So if they don\u2019t want to see Josh in hospice, it\u2019s understandable.\n\nWould they perhaps do a FaceTime visit with Josh?", "NTA - OP remind his siblings that that your niblings have already watched two parents pass away. You cannot force them to go to another death bed. But maybe speak to them and ask if he can have some type of closure with them before he passes away - a phone call, letter or allow you to go in their stead to say goodbye. \n\nIt is possible he feels guilty for not being there for them - he had just married your SIL then lost everything when she was gone.", "Claire recognised they didn\u2019t like Josh, that\u2019s why she asked OP to be their legal guardian before she passed away. The kids have had no relationship with him since, and it\u2019s not their responsibility to heal Josh\u2019s deathbed regret.", "Quite. NTA.", "Thats what is driving me up the wall. The youngest was at least 6, maybe 7 when they met Jay and then a year and a couple months later their mom dies. What kind of bond did he think they had?", "He wanted to, but the kids didn't.", "He wanted to father them, but neither the mother or the kids did. \n\n\nAnd he accepted that with grace. He left when everyone told him to leave, and only returned because of a dying regret. Then, he let that go too. \n\nThis dude's a saint.", "Things wouldn\u2019t have turned out differently since Josh respected the kid\u2019s desires to not interact with him.

Jay was my brother.", "The mother kept the kids away from him. She instructed the family to basically fuck off away from him because the kids didn't love him. \n\nHe accepted that and left. He did what he was supposed to- not force a thing.", "How about using some of that *empathy* for the kids who have already watched their parents die", "I mean, I don't think it is now, or ever was, on the kids, and it's too late to do anything now.  But man, this dude's wife dies a few months after their wedding and then everyone else just went \"aight\" and walked out on him.  That sucks.", "It sounds like these young kids have seen enough death.", "This what I wanted to say.", "Why do you say they'll regret it?", "He wasn't actually my BIL. He was my late SILs husband. Claire was married to my brother. She wasn't actually my sister.", "He respected the kid\u2019s wishes.", "NTA", "These kids lost both of their parents, now you want to guilt trip them into going to see a dying man in hospice that they barely knew and haven't seen in eight years just to make his last wishes come true? That's not how kindness works. He asked, they said no, he accepted their choice.", "The kids didn't want that and I focused on them so never facilitated it. He was aware and respected that they didn't want to keep him in their lives.", "You're completely correct. Also, you going back on saying \"no pressure\" would be a huge blow to their trust in you. NTA", "Grief is weird. Josh's siblings are grieving for his coming death and they have tunnel vision focusing on what would make it easier for Josh. So they are completely discounting the feelings of two children that they don't know because, to them, Josh's deathbed desires matter more. Perhaps give them a bit of grace in your mind, but don't let them bully you or the children. \n\nI've not read the rest of the comments, so forgive me if the following suggestion has come up or is just not feasible... If you are comfortable and the kids are comfortable with it, could you perhaps have a video call with him yourself? Show him pictures of the kids and let him know how well they are doing? Tell him about things you see in them that are like your SIL (his departed wife)? \n\nI assume that he wasn't a bad stepfather, he just was in their lives for a tragically short time due to their mother's passing? I think that such a call would be difficult for you, too, but perhaps would give him some peace in his passing. \n\nYou are of course not obligated to do such a thing. You have no tangible relation to Josh. It is just a thought since you seem to be questioning things here.\n\nBest of luck to you and the kids (young adults, I suppose). I think it speaks very highly of you that you gave them the choice without any pressure.", "Decent people put themselves out a little to help others in need. You give no indication this man treated the kids poorly, fought you for custody or did anything to make life harder for you guys.\n\nHe was a big part of their mother's life and he wants to know her children have happy full lives. They can't bring themselves to give him an hour?? That's super selfish and it's sad you and so many on here don't see this.\n\nI and millions of others volunteer at hospitals, care homes etc. You don't have to have love for someone to be willing to give a little bit of time to ease their last days.\n\nYta and so are the kids.", "Ok, that's bullshit. Of course you shouldn't be forcing them to do this and at their ages it should be their choice. But a brief visit to someone who loved their mother and used to be part of their lives isn't cruel and needn't be traumatizing. Most people would do it out of kindness for an old neighbour or distant relative. Some people do it put of charity for complete strangers. Unless he had been unkind to them, their refusal to spend an hour making a dying man feel a bit better doesn't speak well of them.", "So being respectful to their desires of  not wanting him involved isn\u2019t fair??", "I agree with you to an extent. The kids in no way \"discarded him like trash\", they were 8 and 10 years old, and only knew this man for like 2-ish years, immediately following their bio father death. I'm extrea sympathetic towards Josh, but his siblings have no right to reach out about it or make any accusations.", "Yep. They\u2019re being assholes, but it\u2019s a situation where they get an awful lot of leeway for bad behavior.", "Woah, don't attack the dude because he wanted to see the children he could've raised. \n\nThe only reason they weren't with him is because the mother specifically asked for such. \n\nOP kept the children away from him. I don't know if he reached out before, but it sounds like he took this with INCREDIBLE grace no matter how much it hurt him. \n\n\nThis dude is a saint. He wanted to see the only children in his life, and when they didn't want to see him? He accepted.", "Then that's your answer.  Good luck to you all", "Your right! Hopefully op tellls them to hate their mother!", "fair enough", "I think this will fall on deaf ears. People like nice clean \"you're right, they're wrong\" answers.   \n\n\nThis isn't one of those situations.", "There will be a moment when someone will say something like \"wow really? You couldn't just like, stop by for a quick coffee or something? Like that was his final wish, I'm surprised you didn't do it... crazy\"\n\nAnd they'll say \"well I had my reasons\"\n\nAnd then they'll be haunted by the realization they denied someone's last wish. For a long time. They will think about it often, even though in the moment, logically, they were able to justify to themselves and you why they didn't need to go. Even if it was the absolute right decision at the time to not visit, because they had been through trauma already.\n\nThat is my experience at least. If someone asks me something like that again, I will go visit them before they die, because once someone's dead, you can't make yourself feel better about the decision. You just get to imagine their last moments being sadder than they had to be. They sit there alone, knowing two people that were important to them, even fleetingly so, wanted nothing to do with them in their last moments.  \n\n\nI think your kids made the right call for themselves. It's not my place to say. I can tell you as someone who was in a similar position that I will never forgive myself for not doing this last kindness to another human.   \n\n\nSomething to consider.", "Gotcha - then condolences and block.", "His siblings are being AH but this may be a situation where they are transferring their grief to come through in their anger. Less about the kids and more about him.", "Yes, but that did not stopped him for keeping some kind of contact, if that didn't happen it's a bit naive think that it will happen now, it sad for all parts anyway.", "You are right, it is a big ask and I stated I agree with OPs support of their choice.  Often kindness is most important in life's worst moments so I would disagree...it's a perfect time to at least talk about it.", "It's not a guilt trip, just an opportunity to have a conversation. My Aunt is one of the dearest people in my world and for my whole life when I would turn to her for guidance she would say that if a decision is before me and I have the opportunity to do the kind thing or the unkind thing, then choose the kind one. Have I always done the kind thing? No, and especially when younger. As I grow older, the advice always comes back to me and I do choose kindness when I can.  Again, as I stated- I totally appreciate that OP supported their choice, I don't want them to do anything, I was simply asking.", "If the kids didn't want to have a relationship with him, then what makes him think that they would want to see him now that he's dying?", "Maybe you could go visit Josh, OP? I know it's a really hard ask, and you are in no way obligated, but he seems like a nice guy who had a really big share of pain. I think if you went to tell a few stories of the children, what things they are passionate about, so he can ease his mind, tell him they are safe, they grew up, and they are strong. I imagine Josh could be scared of the children being neglected and knowing they had love and nurture could ease his pain a lot, like a recurring thought of \"why didn't I tried harder?\"\n\n\nI know the kids don't want to go, but ask if they are willing to buy him something for you to bring, write a simple letter, or chose a few photos,... Or something cute, like fluffy slippers. I know you aren't close to him. But you probably have a lot of wonderful memories with the kids, and those memories would be the biggest gift, and a relief. Its a huge ask. And maybe you can't do it, and that's ok.", "Interesting to me that the dying man himself is quite understanding, but his siblings have control issues. It\u2019s possible this would be plenty enough for him. I\u2019m not sure I agree with OP that visiting a dying man for a few minutes is a cruelty- seems like a classic character building situation that everyone will eventually be exposed to, and they don\u2019t have to sit there and watch him die, just wave and smile and say something meaningless in a sociable tone. But it\u2019s OP\u2019s call as the parent", "This. There are other ways to say good bye.", "He wanted it but the kids did not. They hadn't known him for very long and really didn't have any connection to him so I didn't see it as beneficial and their therapists agreed.", "They're not assholes. I'm not a volunteer. I take care of dying people as my job. Part of that is taking care of the family as someone is dying. Actually, as it gets closer to the time of death, there is often less and less for me to do for the actual patient and more to do for the family. The patient is on too much morphine and ativan to do anything but sleep. And it's a very, very nice sleep.  Sounds like this man is about to go into that sleep. And before he dies, he'll almost certainly hallucinate that those kids came to visit him and gave him a hug good bye. \n\nI have taken care of a lot of people as they are dying. I do this because it is as easy on my heart and mind as it is difficult for the people around me at my job. No one is an asshole for avoiding a death bed. I do my job so other people *can* avoid it.", "I meant that it's not fair to expect them to visit him all these years later when he hasn't maintained a relationship with them. But then OP mentioned later that he did want that but that he didn't press it when the children didn't want to see him, so I think he behaved respectfully. Of course OP and the children didn't do anything wrong either. I don't think there are any assholes here, except for the brother and sister. But their behavior doesn't sound too egregious and their brother is dying, so I guess they get something of a pass.", "Not to mention the earliest they could have met him was a year and a half after their father passed away, Josh is lucky kids under ten dealing with that extreme trauma were just standoffish and not outright cruel. I don\u2019t see how he could possibly think they would have ever been comfortable living with him after their mom died. \n\nThe timeline adds up to just under two years with them. Two extremely traumatic years bouncing from one parental loss to another. They probably barely know him, and associate him with a very dark time in their lives. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s an AH for requesting it, but JFC these kids have gone through enough loss that they don\u2019t need to see some guy they barely know and probably resent at his last minutes. And his siblings need to accept that even if he tried their best, he was in these kids life for a fleeting moment and their worst one at that.", "Did you respond to me by accident? Because I didn't attack anyone in my comment.\n\nBut where are you getting OP keeping the kids away?", "Why do you think that moment will come? If they barely knew this man and had no relationship with him, what are the chances of this coming up in the future? Genuinely asking.", "Apparently he indicated he did want to stay in touch when his wife/their mom died, but the kids said no, so Josh and OP didn\u2019t push it then either", "We will have to agree to disagree about that. Death is not a pass to magically make things right. Is it a kindness to the kids to make them talk to someone dying that has no relationship with them, bringing up memories of their parents death and reliving that trama? There are two sides to a relationship and death does not give a pass to intrude on others and vice versa.", "It\u2019s in one of their comments", "My brother is their father, not Josh. Josh was their mother's new husband.", "I think it was hope on his part that they might have some interest in seeing him once. Maybe he thought with time they might have liked to reconnect with him since he loved their mom and them and was the person who took care of her before her death. I can't speak for him though.", "My Dad has a finance with 2 kids.  They were a part of our family.  She died of an aneurysm before they were married.  He never saw the kids again and it crushed him.  To this day, he thinks of them.  So I get where the guy is coming from.", "Yeah I can see that. I think it would have been nice to try and keep up a nominal relationship, send holiday cards or invite him for birthdays or something, but I understand you had bigger things to worry about. Seems like he's understanding though, and I'm sure you can sympathize with his siblings being distraught over losing their brother too. NAH", "The man is lucid enough to ask for them and send a kind response in the face of rejection. I'm not sure why you think he is at a state where he is hallucinating and would terrorize these kids.\n\nNot everyone has to be paid to be willing to help others in small ways. Am I going to wipe a person's butt and give them showers for free? No. But i will keep someone company for a couple hours a week when they are dying and need a bit of comfort. So will pretty much everyone I know. This sub has a lot of people who lack basic decency.", "He didn't think they'd be okay with it. He let it go and he didn't push, ever.", "I actually did, my bad. Another commenter said he'd abandoned them/was at fault for their lack of communication. \n\nAnd at the mother's request, he did exactly that. He's said as much in other comments, though the children were also indifferent to him at the time, so maybe kept them away is strong language.", "It may never come, but it did for me.", "You're right, agree to disagree. I reiterate, I am not advocating that OP ***make*** them do anything, only present the opportunity to do something for someone else with no expectation of anything in return.", "It seems the man did his best for those 2 years and was tossed to the side just because of some ideal of family? *God forbid* he be a single father with lots of support from extended family, what a terrible crime worthy of kicking to the curb. Your siblings are right that what happened in the past was terrible, and you enabled it. Your promise to her was nice and consoling as she died, but never should have been followed through on.\n\nThey were absolutely capable of forming new bonds if done the right way. They were children, small children and kids don't always get what they want. Plenty of people in these situations make it work, even at much older ages, but you did not even attempt it. You are making a poor excuse for being horrible to him. You had a duty to ensure he was in their lives as a father. He obviously loves them, but he was obliterated, insulted, humiliated and pushed to the side while grieving heavily. All because you wouldn't support him as a father and pushed him out. Of course he left, that is on you, you owe him big.\n\nYTA tell your kids they are going and they can suck it up for a day. They are kids and he will be dead soon, again they can suck it up. You wounded him terribly and ensured his family was taken from him at his most vulnerable point in life. YOU OWE HIM.", "I have a friend Dave whose husband had two kids prior to him coming out of the closet.\n\nThe kids mom always had primary custody but Dave absolutely adored his stepkids. Unfortunately things were always tense with their mother because she was religious and was upset that her husband left her to go be a f****t.\n\nSadly Dave's husband died of a heart attack in his sleep in his mid 40s. Dave suddenly found that he had zero access to two kids he had come to consider his children. He was despondent as part of the reason he himself had trouble with being gay was he was always scared he'd never had a family, so he felt so lucky to marry into one, but now it was taken from him.\n\nLuckily his deceased husband's parents have made sure that they get to see their grandchildren on a regular basis, and are sure to invite Dave to their home whenever possible to see them.", "Yeah I think on some level it makes sense to teach these kids a little sociability. They shouldn\u2019t need to have to be so cold, but they probably think it\u2019s normal", "OP trying to keep Josh in their lives even in small ways would be more harmful than beneficial. They knew him only as their late mum\u2019s second husband and not as their stepdad and with Claire gone trying to make a connection happen wouldn\u2019t end well.", "NTA. Don\u2019t owe him shit.", "It also sounds like Claire knew too which is why she asked the OP if she or her parents could care for the kids instead of leaving them with Josh as well.\n\nWhen Claire died it was not about Josh but what her kids needed.\n\nJosh hasn't had anything to do with them for the last 7 odd years.  I get where he's coming from but there was no real relationship with them other than he married their mother and she died a few months later.", "Soft ESH. These kids have gone through a lot. He lost the family he thought he was going to have before it got a chance to start and he was committed to all of them. The kids also need to learn that the most important thing you can do is be there for someone especially when it\u2019s hard or uncomfortable. I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t need boundaries - this is not a boundary violation. I understand they\u2019ve gone through so much. I also think if they can be offered support for their trauma and fears this could serve them better in life in the long run. Hard to call. Not on his sim log s did that and they are the AHs for that.", "NTA.  \n\nYou gave the kids the option to visit someone who was essentially their mom's boyfriend from 10 years back.  They said no.  A visit might give him peace but may just leave another wound on the kids.  They made the call and you listened.", "Ask the kids if they'd be okay with you visiting Josh, possibly showing pictures and talking about how well they are doing now. Or would they be willing to call or face time with him.", "NTA for not needlessly traumatizing your children. I cannot be clearer, you absolutely saved these humans and you are the last word on what is and is not cool to put them through on this matter. For a start, you actually know them.", "They discarded him? He was barely their stepfather. And they were children who'd lost both biological parents- did he want them to scream that they wanted to stay with him? It doesn't sound like he fought for them much, if at all.\n\nNTA- those kids need peace in their lives more than they need to visit their mother's second husband.", "NTA", "NTA but I think you should encourage them to go see him for 20 minutes. The man is facing death, which is very difficult. The kids probably don\u2019t understand, and are just thinking of their own comfort. They should treat  it as an act of compassion/a good deed. If they are afraid of what to say, they could bring some photos to share.", "NTA. It's Leo and Cara decision whether they want to visit Josh before he dies. There's no need to force them when they already made up their decision.", "NAH, but I think you also wouldn't have been TA if you had made the kids go or applied some pressure. He's not asking for a kidney, he's asking for a hospital visit.", "NTA. Josh represents an alternative life they could have had, and that in itself is pretty daunting to conceptualize for the kids. Most of all, he represents their mom moving on from dad and dying shortly thereafter. Essentially he could be a saint, but his association to all of those situations makes him very hard to accept. A lot of pain and doubt has probably been stirred up for the kids. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think the kids would want to do zoom or a phone call either, but they could be game for that. They might learn something about mom, but it\u2019s a big risk that instead of the kids getting closure or sentimental knowledge, they end up with a can of worms. \n\n\nWatching a theoretical third parent die would be tough for kids so young. His peace shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of theirs.", "It's the kids choice. It sounds like he was a stranger to them", "Agreed. NTA.", "Yeah, I\u2019d LOVE to see how OP would \u201cforce\u201d the 18-year-old.", "Seems like Death is just strolling through town.", "I have to be honest. im still rather sad for Josh that the kids couldn't just say \"well we don't really care about him but if it makes his last days/weeks happier for him. We'll do it.\"  \nI don't blame anyone in this story but...you know. just a last bit of kindness for someone their mom once loved.", "Not the person you are replying to, but once Josh passes then anything the kids may have wanted to ask him about their mother is gone with him.   \n\nSo you may want to present it to the kids that way.  Hearing any stories about their mother should be invaluable to them", "They experienced both parents dying at a young age, and unfortunately he's probably a reminder of the time when their mother passed. It may be really hard for them to see him also dying", "Right? I feel really bad for Josh. Hes dying and just wants to see the kids one last time. Sure, they dont have to go see him, but it sure would have meant a real lot to him if they did.", "I wouldn't say the siblings have control issues.. They are hurt, they are grieving, and there was a chance to bring some peace to their dying brother before he died. The kids said no, which is understandable, but they are allowed to be hurt by that decision. I'm not saying they should be going about attacking peoole, but I can see why.", "Everyone with all their *good* intentions keep missing that keeping connection was not beneficial according to their therapists.", "NTA. I can imagine that they would associate Josh with their mother's death, even though he did not cause her cancer. Just the timing of their marriage with everything else including bringing back up the loss of their dad. They would have had a hard time processing it at their age. Even now, as the hit milestones such as graduations and major birthday reignite those feelings. \n\nYour duty is too those kids, not Josh. Block his family if they continue to harass you, and don't let them contact your nibblings.", "You volunteer to do part of my job and devalue the rest of it as showering and butt wiping. Awesome. I take personal care of people in their homes for sometimes a couple years before they pass. We are not the same. You do not know what you are talking about.", "This was their step father of five months, not their father, and they had known him for less than two years.  Under the circumstances and with family there that had been involved with them all of their lives, common sense said the kids would go with OP when they lost their mom.  Those poor kids.  I\u2019m really sorry for Josh going through the trauma of losing his new wife and the family he hoped to make but those poor kids lost both parents before they were ten.  If visiting him is something they aren\u2019t interested in, I really wouldn\u2019t push it.  The only thing I can see it doing is bringing that trauma and loss back for them again.", "They probably have a lot of sadness tied up with their memories of ex-stepdad. Their dad died, and their mom died. All of their memories of this guy were during that grief. It might have been extremely emotional, rather than cold, for them to consider seeing him.\n\nOP doesn't say if ex-stepdad tried to keep in touch, just that they never saw him again.", "This might actually be a very rare once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the kids to hear stories about their mother before he dies, too."]}
