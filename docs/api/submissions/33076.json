Jay died when the kids were 5 and 7. Claire met her second husband Josh a year and a half later and they married when the kids were 8 and 10. Sadly, only days after their wedding Claire was diagnosed with terminal cancer and passed away five months later. Before her death she told me the kids wanted to live with me or my parents when she was gone and did not want to remain with Josh. She wanted me to take them because my parents had become incredibly messed up after we lost Jay and she was worried about the kids not being well taken care of. She told me she knew her Josh would raise them but the kids wanted their family and she wanted to make this as easy on them as possible. So I agreed and after Claire died the kids came to live with me and did not see Josh again.\n\nA few weeks ago Josh contacted me through social media.  He's on hospice and had apparently been thinking about Claire and the kids and he always regretted that the kids hadn't gotten close enough to him to want him raising them after Claire died. He said it would bring him some peace if he could see them again, even if it was only for a few minutes. He told me he felt like it was a tragedy how everything happened.\n\nI asked Leo and Cara if they would at all want or be willing to go see him. I made it clear there was no pressure but I wanted to give them the chance to decide. Neither of them wanted to go see Josh. I told them it was fine and I let him know that it would not be possible but I was sorry to hear how sick he was and I hoped he could find peace.\n\nHe replied to me a couple of days after my response and said he understood. Then a couple of days after that his brother and sister tell me how shitty it is that I wouldn't encourage the kids to go see him or make them go if I had to. They said their brother did his best while he was in their lives and they discarded him like trash. They said he will never get the chance to see them again, he'll be gone and I should be ashamed of my actions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702654352, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18j2q7o/aita_for_refusing_to_force_my_niece_and_nephew_to/", "score": 281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But sometimes the crop can be a little less bitter if some people have a little damn compassion. \n\nYTA, OP and your children are selfish. At least they could send a card or something.", "This man is a stranger to them basically and they have already watched both of their parents die. Probably not the best situation for a life lesson on kindness. It would be something if he kept in contact with the kids while they were growing up, but to show up after a decade and ask this is a bit of an ask.", "Yes, I dropped it once they said no. But I did make it clear they can change their mind and all they have to do is say so.", "Sure, drag up the trauma of losing both parents again and ask these poor kids to go visit a dying stranger they have no connection with in hospice. That isn\u2019t kindness, that\u2019s triggering their trauma to make a stranger feel better. NO!", "Seriously what is it with these \"teaching empathy moment\" takes? Theyre16 and 18 years olds, old enough to know and decide for themselves. \nThis man was in their lives for 3 years, which isnt long. They didn't have much of a relationship, he and they did not try to pursue one after their mom died. They moved on.\nWould it be nice if they did go see him? Yeah! Does them saying no warrants a lesson on kindness and empathy? NO. Its not about kindness and empathy, it's about a near stranger asking them to his deathbead and them going: \"but we don't know you\"", "She said he wanted to stay in contact  but neither kid wanted thst", "She can't force them to go if they don't want to", "It wasn't that Claire didn't want him to raise them. The kids told her they wanted to be with family, with me or my parents, not with him. The kids did not love him or consider him family by the time their mom got sick, and not when she passed. So I do not feel bad for taking them. This was what the kids wanted and their feelings were always my priority. My brother would have wanted me to make sure I was always there to support the kids.", "he was hardly In there life's  he's a stranger they don't him owe anything", "Maybe you could do something for him like send him some pictures and an update on their lives?  And you could tell him that they said something nice.  It would be a kindness for a dying man.", "Info: Is there a reason you didn't keep up a relationship with Josh after their mom had died? Was there any conversation about him visiting on occasion, or was there just no interest on either side?", "From one of OP\u2019s comments, apparently Josh made it known that he would love to stay in contact but the kids didn\u2019t show an interest or specifically said they didn\u2019t want to so OP didn\u2019t encourage it. Basically, the same as now. They said no, so everyone dropped it.", "This, I know time can get away from you and kids grow up fast, but if he wanted to be part of their lives he could have made the effort to meet them.", "it's unfortunate, but not surprising. Josh couldn't have been around for more than years before your sil died. and given they spend half a year dealing with her declining health, it's not all shocking they didn't develop a relationship", "You are choosing a harsher connotation. He didn\u2019t invest in their lives and now they don\u2019t care. Cats in the Cradle and all that.", "Would it be possible to have them give him a call at least? I realize they don't have a current connection to him, and they've obviously been through a lot, but it's the kind of thing that you might regret not doing later on.", "I didn\u2019t say he was a monster. He had many opportunities to reach out and didn\u2019t until he was desperate. He is a stranger and they owe him nothing.", "They don't owe h anything they aren't selfish would u go vist a stranger", "I see where OP said the kids didn\u2019t want to live with him, but not where she said they wanted no contact.", "They were *very* young children, not 15 year olds. You treated them like they were older and couldn't make those bonds. But they could have and now it's too late. Having their father in their lives and promoting that bond to the best of your ability was your duty. Even if hard, even if it took years, you needed to at least have planned and made an effort to ensure he was included regularly. You needed to have not taken them UNLESS he couldn't. It doesn't matter what she wanted or what the kids wanted at so young an age. He was pushed to the side like he was worthless and incapable. Of course he left, that is on you and her.", "I\u2019m with this.", "What a great suggestion!  A kind gesture and a appropriate compromise for this situation.", "This would be nice without actually impacting the consent of the kids since OP is already the guardian. This story already has too many tragedies", "YES, THIS. The kids don't want to be faced  with death. Many cannot handle it.  This is very sad.", "Ah, I didn't see that. That does make it a little sad for him. Honestly he doesn't seem like an AH at all. If he wanted stay in the kids' lives but they didn't want that, it was right of him to accept this. He was also within his rights to ask if he could see them once more before he dies, and they were within their rights to decline, which he seems to have graciously accepted. I'd say his brother and sister are being tiny aholes but their brother is dying and they're probably upset.\n\nI'd go with NAH on this one.", "Oh that's a bit sad. IDK I probably would have invited him over a few times and had the kids hang out with him (with the rest of the family there). I know people disagree with this approach, but kids don't naturally want to build or keep up relationships with people, even people they like, it's just a lot of work and kids are very in the moment about things. That's usually why adults facilitate these things. But what's done is done now, NAH.", "They really don't want contact with him at all. Even a call. They never had a connection to him and I do not see them regretting this later. I have told them they can change their minds and I will help them if they do. But I don't see this changing.", "He was not their father. He was their mother's second husband that was in their lives all of two years. The kids were old enough to decide they had no interest in building a familial relationship with this guy."]}
