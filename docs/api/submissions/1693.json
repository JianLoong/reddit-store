It's not like your communication with your father is gradually picking up and you're growing closer. If you're both letting the relationship dwindle (and no judgement there - you're only matching his low effort, which is totally fair), then there's no need to tell him about your wedding if you don't want to.", "Nope, NTA. If he never reaches out, never even put aside time to meet your man, he's probably not more important than some/many other people in your and you fianc\u00e9's lives that also didn't get an invite. I guess you're not inviting every friend, coworker and extended family member you know. And if you know there's emotional manipulation on the horizon, just pass.\n\nYou reap what you sow. And when you're a father, it's not hard to sow the seeds of an invite to your daughter's wedding. And he couldn't even manage that", "NTA. Would you accept this behaviour from a friend? Then don't accept it from family.", ">I know my father is a very emotional man and knowing he won\u2019t be included in the traditional father of the bride stuff will definitely hurt him\n\nBut if he cared (about you, your SO, your life in general), he'd make an effort. I see no efforts here, he would be like a stranger at your wedding.\n\nNTA", "it's your wedding, do what feels right for you. NTA", "NTA. Do what suits you. It sounds like he will try to make you feel guilty regardless of when he finds out so the only downside to your plan is that if he finds out from someone else you won't get to deal with his reaction on your own terms and timeline.", "NTA, it's your choice, but- since you talked about what might or might not hurt him, I'm guessing you WANT to keep what little relationship you have with him, right?\n\nNot sending an invite will most likely end it.\n\nI'd just send a courtesy invite and be done with it. If he has issues with not being involved in the father-daughter dance, then that's his issue. But not sending an invite or going out of your way to not even mention being married means you're going out of your way to exclude him. Which, again, is okay. But remember it'll end whatever little contact or relationship you two have.", "NTA. It is never the onus of the child to maintain a relationship with a parent, no matter how old you are. That is always the parent\u2019s responsibility. He dropped the ball and you\u2019re under no obligation to offer him a heads up etc.", "NTA. Your father has at best been sporadic in your life and as you say, you aren't remotely close. It's your wedding and should be as you want it. Don't feel bad and don't feel like you have to put up with water works and guilt vibes. You will probably have to face those after the fact when he eventually finds out but you can at least enjoy the build up and the day without all the complications.", "NTA.\n\nInspite of multiple efforts from your side, he didnot even stayed in contact. In any relation, both people must make equal effort to maintain the relationship. At this point, he is just some random person and you are not required to invite him.", "NTA I have a good relationship with my dad but I honestly don't want to be walked down the aisle. And I didn't even tell my family when I got engaged. I don't have a bad relationship with anyone but my mom. \n\nTo me the person that's always been there for me is myself and good friends. My family isn't really a talk and listen type of family. IMO the people that were there for you in life should be the ones involved in the wedding. \n\nIf you're scared he will feel left out but still want him there you could always do a second father daughter dance after the dance with your grandpa but you don't really owe that to him. I get the awkward feeling tho bc I didn't want to invite my mom....\n\nYou just gotta do what feels right for you at the end of the day and everyone else can just get over it....in my opinion", "NTA -  It's your wedding you invite who you want, and do what you want to do. Only thing I would say is \"I know my father is a very emotional man and knowing he won\u2019t be included in the traditional father of the bride stuff will definitely hurt him.\" If that's the case, imagine how he will feel not even knowing you're getting married, let alone not being invited. Again, 100% your call, and if you don't want him there NTA for not inviting him. Just accept he will probably be very upset not being invited. If you aren't worried about that, then obviously crack on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't give him the space to make the day about him though. Just be glad he's there and move on with your plans. Don't address him being emotional just let him go through what he goes through like it's normal. You don't have to invite anyone you don't want to have at your wedding but dad might want to have a plus one so think of that before inviting him. Seems like you don't want dad's side of the family getting the idea they might get invited, too. Again, you don't have to have anyone there you don't want to see that day. My nephew decided not to invite our side of the family to his wedding and that was perfectly okay. We aren't close, there are no bad feelings there, and nobody was bothered by it. Hopefully, it will be that smooth for you, too.", "He regrets not being there for you, but not enough to actually be there for you. NTA.", "NTA. It sounds like you have a healthy understanding of the situation and are taking steps to reduce needless drama.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d probably do the same in your situation.\n\nAs another commenter mentioned, this will probably close whatever sporadic relationship you have with him. If you\u2019re okay with that outcome, go for it. If you want to periodically hear how he\u2019s doing, I\u2019m not sure this will make that easy going forward.", "NTA. This might be a kinda mean analogy, but it's kind of like your dad is that best friend you had in elementary school who eventually started ditching you more and more to hang out with the \"cool kids\" to the point that by graduation day you hadn't spoken to eachother in a couple of years. Nobody would say you had to invite them to your wedding just because your mom has really cute photos of the two of you as kids and you still send each other birthday texts. y'know?\n\ndo what makes you happy.", "Nta but maybe send him a letter letting him know what is up and why", "I appreciate you pointing that out! However im  gonna sound like an AH for saying this but I really don\u2019t care about his feeling technically. I just mentioned it would hurt him because every time he has been \u201churt\u201d (me not mentioning him in an NHS speech, giving my mom a stole of gratitude at my graduation but not him, posting about my moms support when I found my first big girl job) he would cry and make a speech to me about how he needed to be there more for me and how he\u2019s sorry (nothing changes tho). I just don\u2019t wanna deal with that at my wedding. If he never talks to me again well it would honestly probably only be a handful of conversations gone from my lifetime.", "When I was about 30, my dad became interested in me again for some reason. I asked him why he was reaching out to me now, when he couldn\u2019t be bothered to keep in touch with me (and my little sister) much after he and my mom divorced. That\u2019s when he flat-out blamed me for how we fell out of touch at that time. Said **I** hadn\u2019t called **him** enough. I had been 9 when they divorced (and *he* about 30; an irony not lost on me during our discussion). NTA", "Yeah, in that case there's  definitely no need to worry about anything. Hope you have an awesome wedding day \\^\\^", ">he would cry and make a speech to me\n\nYeah...if this man gets drunk near a microphone, he'll be making that speech to your entire wedding.  Especially if he's \"processing the hurt\" of not walking you down the aisle and doing the father-daughter dance.\n\nHe shouldn't get to make *your* achievements about *him* not being there.  If he's done it before, he'll definitely do it there.  \n\nNTA for your own protection.\n\nCongrats on the wedding, and many years of happiness to you and your fianc\u00e9!", "NTA. Since your father never made the time to meet your fianc\u00e9, I would not bother to invite him. Someone who thought that he deserves recognition for your achievements when he was barely in your life would feel slighted if you did not invite him to walk you down the aisle or to be your partner for the father-daughter dance. He would also expect recognition in any toast that mentions your mother (who did all the work of raising you).\n\nHe didn\u2019t make any effort to be a father to you and the waterworks are nothing more than trying to manipulate you into giving him his way. You should not have been the only one reaching out to have a relationship with him. He wasn\u2019t a good husband to your mother or a good father to you. No reason to invite him into the next chapter of your life.\n\nWishing you the wedding of your dreams and a long, happy marriage. Congratulations!", "OP, your dad sounds a lot like mine, as does the deterioration of your relationship. I\u2019ve been married for three years now, and I still haven\u2019t told my dad. We only exchange holiday and birthday texts, and I haven\u2019t seen him since 2016. I can relate, and I\u2019m sorry your dad sucks. You need to do what feels right to you.", "Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc9b"]}
