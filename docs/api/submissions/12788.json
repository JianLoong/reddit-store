A 12 year old, involved in illegal activities, making a ton of money, yet his family can't afford food.  What was he doing with all this money he was making?  Why wasn't he helping his family?  How did he, an unaccompanied minor, make it to US by himself, find a place to live, and manage to get a great education and high paying job?  Meanwhile, his family is happy he's gone because they don't have to feed him?  Yeah, something stinks and I'm calling BS on this entire story.  Either you've made it up or you were fed a pack full of lies. But, if you believed this fantasy and promised your husband to give money to his family, you need to live up to that promise.

He intended that inheritance to go to them, and it's not your place to decide that they should be punished.

They didn't report him missing because they couldn't afford to feed him, but they also probably couldn't afford a search.. you had to pay for information, I'm sure families have to pay for help.

But something about this seems fishy.  If your husband truly thought his family was frantically searching for him, and he did nothing to assure them that he was alive and safe, that is a genuinely terrible and cruel thing to do.

And let's face it with the shit health care system in the states they will need a substantial amount 10's of 1000's of $$$$. Don't give anything and block them on everything", "NTA, even if it's not a scam.", "NTA", "NTA. Who knows if they're even telling the truth...", "DO NOT SEND MONEY", "NTA. Dont give the money", "NTA. Smells like a scam to me. Bad enough they didn\u2019t come looking for him, but to be glad that he was no longer there is cruel. Keep the money and start a scholarship or donate it to a good cause.", "Did you husband leave a written will?  If he did... you are legally obligated to give him the money. \n\nIf he didn't... then you're probably alright... you might want to talk to a lawyer anyway. NTA though", "YTA. Your husband expressed his wishes. Of course people in a small third world country are worried about food.", "Don\u2019t give them a penny. That is awful behavior", "I wonder if they were disparaging their house out of embarrassment.  Like, \"I'm so sorry the house isn't up to standard; we need to fix a few things.\"  I insult my own cooking before anyone else can.", "No, but the OP will always know that she ignored his wishes.", "This!", "NTA and honestly I wouldn't try doing this, I'm myself from a third world country and with a little money everything can be corrupted even the hospital bill and communication, you already proved that with the police, what makes you think that the hospital can be different? They probably hire someone to make a fake bill or to pretend to be from the hospital", "Make sure you tranfer to hospital account not just someone account. I know some country has different banking system, like if you don't have local bank it will be difficult to do transactions between country so they bypass through someone name. But just insist to have hospital direct account."]}
