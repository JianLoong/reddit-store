A 12 year old, involved in illegal activities, making a ton of money, yet his family can't afford food.  What was he doing with all this money he was making?  Why wasn't he helping his family?  How did he, an unaccompanied minor, make it to US by himself, find a place to live, and manage to get a great education and high paying job?  Meanwhile, his family is happy he's gone because they don't have to feed him?  Yeah, something stinks and I'm calling BS on this entire story.  Either you've made it up or you were fed a pack full of lies. But, if you believed this fantasy and promised your husband to give money to his family, you need to live up to that promise.

He intended that inheritance to go to them, and it's not your place to decide that they should be punished.

But something about this seems fishy.

Dont give the money", "NTA. Smells like a scam to me. Bad enough they didn\u2019t come looking for him, but to be glad that he was no longer there is cruel. Keep the money and start a scholarship or donate it to a good cause.", "Did you husband leave a written will?  If he did... you are legally obligated to give him the money. \n\nIf he didn't... then you're probably alright... you might want to talk to a lawyer anyway. NTA though", "YTA. Your husband expressed his wishes. Of course people in a small third world country are worried about food.", "Don\u2019t give them a penny. That is awful behavior", "I wonder if they were disparaging their house out of embarrassment.  Like, \"I'm so sorry the house isn't up to standard; we need to fix a few things.\"  I insult my own cooking before anyone else can.", "No, but the OP will always know that she ignored his wishes.", "This!", "NTA and honestly I wouldn't try doing this, I'm myself from a third world country and with a little money everything can be corrupted even the hospital bill and communication, you already proved that with the police, what makes you think that the hospital can be different? They probably hire someone to make a fake bill or to pretend to be from the hospital", "Make sure you tranfer to hospital account not just someone account. I know some country has different banking system, like if you don't have local bank it will be difficult to do transactions between country so they bypass through someone name. But just insist to have hospital direct account.", "YTA  you promised your husband  and have gone\n back on it due to information you have found which you are most likely looking at through grief and a western eye.", "Just send them the money and be done.", "It's easy for us living in the first world to judge someone for saying they were glad a child left because they ate too much. Of course, that sounds horrible.  I just wonder if we suddenly had that level of poverty, would we see things the same way? I've never had to deal with a lack of food.  I can imagine one could feel a sense of relief to no longer have to provide food when there's little money for food.\n\nYour husband wanted that inheritance to go to them.  I think you should honor his request.", "NTA", "She\u2019s technically a stranger, but it was his dying wish. Honor it for him \n\nNTA", "NTA.  If you don't need the money yourself, you might want to donate the amount to a reputable charity or elementary/middle/high school that is run in your husband's home country, either in one big donation or an annual donation on his birthday.  the donation might be more in the spirit of what your husband wished for.", "NTA, you can keep the money and be sure your husband would have been okay with your decision. You can also donate the money to a charity that would have helped your husband when he needed it like helping children overcome hardships or helping immigrants or to help parents who are looking for their missing children like the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.", "Info.  You spent over a month with them.  Did you think they were good people?\n\n I have no judgement because I don't think there is a wrong choice.  That being said, they also have treated a total stranger to them with respect for almost 2 months just because you are the wife of their son.  I think you should consider how you felt about them these 2 months into your consideration.", "Gentle YTA. You\u2019re going against his wishes. How much money are we talking about? Why not just give them some money and have a clear conscience? If you had to ask, it\u2019s bothering you and probably always will if you don\u2019t give them anything. Why didn\u2019t he help them while he was alive?", "You wouldn\u2019t fulfil a dying mans wish? Cause they were too poor and trying to survive to look for him? These people are worried about eating, this is not about nice its about survival.", "NTA 100%", "NTA\n\nEven if you went against what you knew was right (which would be to NOT give them a dime), I can predict what will happen. \n\nThey will spend it all within a year and then you will never be rid of them. They will continually harass you for more and more because they would now see you as an easy touch.", "I think you should honour your husband's wishes and do what he wished, and give them the money. You are inserting your judgement but the facts are, he asked you to do this.", "NTA. Would you consider donating it to a charity or cause in his name?", "faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, because your husband asked you to do this but did not make arrangements himself for this in his will. He had time to formalize it and make sure money was set aside, he didn\u2019t do so. \n\nYou know what he wanted. You know that what he believed wasn\u2019t true. You don\u2019t know if that would change how he felt. He ultimately left control of his estate in your hands to do with as you wish. \n\nIt\u2019s your call, and only you will know if your decision feels right or wrong. \n\nIt does sound like searching for him would have been extremely difficult for his impoverished family, and not to mention dangerous if criminal activity would become involved. His parents had other children to look after and he chose to leave. He was young and forced into some difficult choices, but it doesn\u2019t sound like his family was abusive. He clearly felt guilty and sad and wanted to make a gesture after he was gone.", "NTA but it sounds like the husband knew what his family\u2019s poverty situation was and wanted to leave an inheritance. It not right to dishonour your husband\u2019s wishes in his will. I\u2019m sorry this is a painful situation and poverty is very cruel.", "Esh. He specifically stated he wanted that money to go to them. You ate looking at their reaction from first world eyes. If they were destitute and he was into illegal activities it could end up with them in big trouble. They likely could not afford food so while yes its sad it is also understandable when you look at the fact in many countries kids move out in early to mid teens. Stop looking at this in first world eyes. Also no mater what he said that is where he wanted the money to go Ad one of his last wishes. You are. Not honoring his last wish. That's like spitting in his eye.", "NTA", "it's also pretty common that you have to pay the police to file a police report, and pay more for them to actual investigate.", "Yeah, we can\u2019t really look at this through a first world, privileged lens. It\u2019s way beyond most people\u2019s experience, at least on this sub.", "His fears might also be related to why they didn\u2019t want to draw police attention by filing a report.", "I mean the promise was made when the late husband assumed they looked for them and wanted to find him.\n\nThe revelation that the OP learned changes that and turns it into a moral question of what would the late Husband do.\n\nSometimes you can't follow someones last wishes. In such a case it's best to do what they would do in that case.", "I bet there's no hospital, no illness, no bill. They just want money. And if by any miracle, a hospital bill comes your way, you won't see the end of the money requests. There's nothing wrong with blocking those numbers. You reap what you sow. Poor or not, the fact they didn't care if your husband lived or died after he disappeared shows how horrible people they are.", "As others have suggested, that could be the exact same reason why they didn\u2019t try to look for him. In addition to being another mouth they couldn\u2019t feed, it sounds like young men disappearing in their country is almost always associated with illegal activities. Maybe they knew that they would be putting the rest of their family at risk by trying to find him. I can completely understand why you\u2019re upset. But I do think there are other factors about their circumstances that need to be taken into account.", "Oh! Donate any difference in the cost of her care to the hospital?", "YTA. Follow what your husband asked you to do.  You have no idea what living in poverty is like.  It\u2019s telling that the father and brothers are dead.", "YTA can you imagine how poor they had to be to be happy when your husband left? You realize he was a kid and maybe they tried their best so he didn't notice how little food and money they had? I don't think they didn't love him but extreme poverty is brutal. Imo you should respect his wish and give them the money and never contact them again.", "Well....they are so poor that the money would have changed their lives and they do need it which is what your late husband wanted for them. Like if MIL is actually sick, you'd be letting your husband's mother die because you are holding a grudge and understandably so.\n\nIt's a question for an ethics class. I would personally give the money and cut ties. The SIL probably really needs the money and with holding it from that family because they were just trying to survive seems cruel to me.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nThey didn't care enough to look for their own child because he ate too much? Are you fkn serious? \n\nTo me it seems that as far as they could have cared he could have been dead, but instead they find out their long lost son got married and to an (as I understand) American. (which to a 3rd world country means lots of money). They assume they only shed surface tears when you went to tell them their son had passed, if they shed any tears at all.\n\nAnd now, big surprise, they want the rich daughter in law to give them money. For hospital bills no less. \n\nI smell an emotional manipulating, money-milking rat.", "YTA very easily and making emotional decisions. You are also disrespecting your husband's final wishes.", "Soft NTA, but in all reality, the money left for your husband's family, is for his family, not for you to umm and arr about, or question what they will do with it. \n\nIt's quite simply not debatable, when he earnt that money himself and trusted you to do as he asked. If he asked you to observe, assess and make judgment on them, then that's a different story. I'm guessing he didn't though right? I'm also guessing he knew exactly what they were like, but he was a man of integrity and I think you need to  respect that. \n\nYou may be correct in deeming them unkind (although that's taking on a cultural argument, some cultures are just harsh), however, without his mother you would never have had the time with him that you did, so be grateful for that and do the right thing by your husband. \n\nGive them their money then cut ties completely. I personally wouldn't want the bad karma that would come with dishonoring your husbands wishes and it will come, in one way, shape or form unfortunately.", "NTA. Give the money to charity, and if you pay for the hospital, pay the hospital directly.  If she really is there, which I doubt.", "I won't call you an ah, but look at this from their point of view. You say it's a poverty stricken 3rd world country where money is used to make officials corrupt. That implies criminals may very well run things. He started doing illegal things to make money and flee the country. Maybe they thought he was dead. Maybe they were glad he was gone because his activities could have gotten them all killed. Maybe they hoped he'd found a better life they couldn't provide for him instead of staying there and starving with the rest of the family. I grew up absolutely destitute till my mom moved closer to family and eventually got remarried. She had 5 of us and was left to raise us alone with no help from our father. And as bad off as we were, sometimes no power,no running water and many times not enough food, occasionally homeless, we were STILL not as bad off as many people in 3rd world countries. Please don't judge too harshly without having lived in the situation.", "You're stealing from your husband's estate.  He knew who his family was. And he made his wishes clear. \n\nFinding out that his family didn't miss him must have been painful. But them sucking is *why* he was there with you all those years. Maybe the person they knew wasn't worth looking for. But the man you knew was wonderful. \n\nESH.", "NTA, and that could very well be a scam. I would t send them a penny", "Yes, I think YTA if you don't honor his last wish. Hear me out.\n\nYou're thinking of this from your perspective but not from his. Would he have been glad that his family was traumatized? Happy that they spent years in anguish? No, it's something he felt guilty about. It's not something he hoped for. He would probably breathe a sigh of relief to find out he didn't have that on his conscience.", "This is a tough call but I think you have to carry out your husband\u2019s wishes.", "Nta", "INFO: is there a possibility that MIL was scared to go to the police? Few people actually expect the cops to help. Especially poor people. \n\nEven in nyc (\u201cthe 1st world\u201d) we went to the cops when the super of our building threatened to burn it down. The cops wouldn\u2019t even take our complaint because we didn\u2019t own the building.", "YTA. To disagree with everyone here, not looking for a kid doesn't mean they didn't love them. They had to make extremely difficult choices in that era. Going to the police might not have been helpful / an option, if the police are corrupt. And they probably hoped that he was doing better wherever he was. \n\nRegardless, even if they were callous about it, I would give it to them. \nIf I were your husband, I'd have been PISSED that you made this choice for me when I explicitly gave instructions that the money goes to them. I would also give it without strings attached. It's important to honor his dying wishes and connect with the family, even if they weren't the best family at the time.", "If there are any charities that your late Husband would agree with, you could give the money to the charity?\n\nYou might be able to find a project either in the country or in the US whom could put it towards a scholarship and help young people in foster care stay in education or vocational training? \n\nNTA.", "YTA, and you need to check your privilege. **Hard.**\n\nA) You know that they *couldn\u2019t afford to feed all of their children*. Were they supposed to pick one of the others to starve to death so your husband could stay? Sometimes, people have to make really hard, really awful choices.\n\nB) How did his father and siblings die? Was it related to being poor? Could they afford food? Shelter? Medicine? Medical care?\n\nC) You can afford to travel internationally and rent a place to stay for a month, just for shits & giggles. Is it possible that you *might* have a completely different lifestyle and perspective than people who live in what you describe as a Third-World country?\n\nD) You mentioned that you, yourself, had to give the police money just to find out if a report had been filed. Don\u2019t you think they also charge to file the report in the first place? How are people facing starvation supposed to afford that?\n\nE) If your husband was involved in illegal activities, **why in hell** would his family ask *the cops* to look for him???!?\n\nI think it\u2019s entirely possible - even likely! - that your husband imagined exactly what you found, it just doesn\u2019t match *your* preconceived ideas. It\u2019s very, very common for people to not trust the police; in fact, there are probably more countries where the police will shoot you or ask for bribes than there are countries where they\u2019re trustworthy. His family had very, very few good ways of finding him, and for all you know, they spent years wandering the streets looking for him, and asking every person they saw who wasn\u2019t a cop (because only a foreigner or an idiot would trust the police) about him.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure when your husband asked you to give his family that money, he didn\u2019t mean, \u201cunless you think you\u2019re better than them, because they\u2019re poor; then you can feel free to let my mother die.\u201d", "I would say NTA regardless of what you do.\n\nYou got to see your husband's better years and you saw he only spoke about his family with love in his heart.\n\nYou've also gotten to see, that his family was glad he left. They felt like he was a waste of food. They didn't look for him. They didn't even ask friends to see if there was even a vague idea of where he had gone to know he was safe or alive still. They removed him from their lives and buried his memory, while he couldn't stop thinking about improving their lives and making up for the harm he thought he did.\n\nAnd honestly, if they live in a third world country, I wouldn't be blind to the possibility they just think you are stereotypical and rich, and want to milk you for cash now. \n\nBut if he was a kind man, I think he would still want money reserved for them to go to them, but not a penny more and possibly not the full amount since 3 of the people it was for died.\n\nYour husband left them this money to improve their lives, and even if you think them undeserving of it, the kindest part of me wants to believe he would still want to do that, maybe not to the full extent in his pain, but enough to give them a helping hand, enough that you can live with it. And then cut contact so they can't start trying to demand more money or help from you.\n\nBecause I think this is why you are torn - you feel anger that your husband was afraid of the harm he caused and that they seem to have not cared, but you don't want to leave them in a truly dire spot either, especially with how much love your husband spoke of them and wanted the best for them.", "If she needs the money for something and she knows her late husband would want her taken care of first then ok. But if she\u2019s not going to use the money then I say give it to them. That\u2019s what he wanted. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re gonna do bad things with the money either. They\u2019re likely just gonna buy more food for themselves to eat. Or maybe a decent place to live. At least if you give them the money you know his final wish was granted and you did help better their lives. Is that really a bad thing? It seems that\u2019s what the op wanted.", "I just don\u2019t understand why if if another mouth to feed is such a burden these people continue procreating. Like how are you stressed about money and making ends meet that you can barely feed the mouths you have and yet you can somehow still find time/energy to have sex and reproduce. Like wtf!", "What\u2019s it like in your the 3rd world country.  It sounds like they were very poor.  Was it common for older kids to leave home?  Having read a few thing about life in very impoverished areas I know it\u2019s not easy to afford kids let alone many of them.  Also that people sometimes become desensitized to emotions and can only focus on what\u2019s in front of them.  It might have been seen as a relief that 1. He got out and hopefully can make it on his own and 2. They can feed the rest of them a little better.  Might sound bad to people in first world countries but that\u2019s just how it is.  Or they could be just bad people that contribute to keeping those countries down.  You obviously know more than we could but I do find it interesting he thought the money would be life changing yet didn\u2019t try to help them in the past.  Just an all around bummer of a situation.", "And if he was into some illegal activities, he may have caused some heartbreak for his family. I feel like maybe we don\u2019t know the whole story here.", "I\u2019m sorry your husband died but I\u2019m glad you found out the truth of his family.
