A few months ago, his parents arrived from India to live with us. I was excited to make an impression and went out of my way to make them feel comfortable. They were nice to me in the beginning, but some of their demands started making me feel queasy in my own home\n1.They were uncomfortable with my boyfriend and I sleeping together in the same room, resulting in my boyfriend having to camp out in the living room for 2 months\n2. The mother taking over the kitchen and excluding me from grocery shopping even after requests to include me\n3.Not acknowledging me as his gf in front of friends\n4.Not offering to help with cleaning and general upkeep\n5.Rearranging furniture multiple times inspite of being requested not to\n6.The father expressing his concern over me not helping his wife in the kitchen(which wasn't true)\n7.The parents giving credits to my bf and thanking him instead of me on multiple occasions even when they knew he was not involved in planning/execution of dinner parties/trips etc\n8.The father feeling \"uncomfortable\" that I wore a short dress at home. He did apologise later when I ended up crying about this but insisted that these are the \"values\" his family has been brought up with\n\nI suppose my issue is not that his parents are not very nice to me, but that my bf who has been nothing short of ideal all the years I've known him, seems to not acknowledge any of these as real issues and did not stand up for me when his father had an issue with my clothes. All of my concerns were either dismissed with \"So what? They're guests. We have to make them feel comfortable\" or \"My dad is traditional and there's nothing wrong with his mentality\"\n\nThe parents left after spending 3 months here and I moved to another city in Australia for a job shortly after.My long distance relationship has been great for the 4 months that we've been living apart and we see each other once a month. However, my bf recently told me his parents are visiting shortly for 2 months again\n\nI am shocked that my bf wouldn't consult me or warn me before their flight tickets were booked. It has triggered the concerns I previously had and are met with \"but they are MY PARENTS\". I was also told that these visits will be frequent and I HAVE to be ok with this when I move back in with him\n\nI am being asked to give up my privacy and personal space for months every year. Not to mention the fact that I am now very self conscious around his father, given him feeling \"uncomfortable\" about what I wear. I want to make it clear here that I would never ask my bf to stop his parents from visiting us for a few weeks once a year or so. But I'm afraid 2-3 months will take a toll on me.\n\nAITA for expecting my bf to take my needs into consideration and stand up for me when needed?", "created_utc": 1679992198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124hzvo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_adjust_to_my28f/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For your own peace of mind!", "I would be out of that situation faster than a vindaloo exits my digestive system.", "So, your long distance relationship is going great, then try make it even further, with a man like him you'll be happy only from far away \nNTA", "Get out while you still can. He's telling you who he is. Believe him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nYou like the long distance. That\u2019s a red flag. He doesn\u2019t consult you in decisions. That\u2019s a red flag. His parents make you uncomfortable and he doesn\u2019t defend you. That\u2019s a reg flag. I think it may be time to take a good look at the relationship and decide if you want to proceed with it.", "Agreed as to NTA but this family is never going to change so the best advice is don\u2019t move back in with them and dump him after carefully explaining why.\n\nA culture of assholery is assholery, not culture. His parents are rude, overbearing, sexist, and creepy. Bin the lot of them.", "They are Indian and as an Indian myself let me tell you that will never happen.", "Can confirm this. \nSource: am indian too", "Came here to say this. You're NTA, of course not, but they aren't either - simply because they have no idea that they're wrong, and don't believe in the slightest that they need to change (even if they absolutely need to.) Those are their values, and they're going to live by them, no matter what you say. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take some serious calls about this relationship :')", ">\tHe\u2019ll try to dress it as a cultural thing, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s an AH thing. \n\nWell said.", "Exactly! You need to have a serious talk with bf", "Put up with it for 30-40 years? They won't even acknowledge that she is his girlfriend lol", "As an Indian woman, I will never understand non Indian women who willingly get into relationships with Indian men. Unless they happen to be orphans, 99% of the times their parents will act exactly like this. For us mostly we don\u2019t have other options but really why would any one take a chance like that?"]}
