The reality is his parents use the 'it's our culture' as an excuse to override any consideration for your culture and upbringing.  Because in their culture the man is king and the women are subservient.  As the girlfriend and not one they chose for him, you have pretty much zero status and therefore they have no concern for you or your feelings.  This is going to be your reality.  As others have said, they likely will move in after they retire.\n\nSo while you are away, you need to think about this relationship.  I can't tell you what to do as I'm not living the situation.  Only you can know what you can live with, what you can't, and what is an absolute deal breaker.  But look, think, and consider.  His parents are not going to change because I their culture they are revered and the head of household therefore they have no need to change or consider others. Even your boyfriend showed no regard as his parents said they are going to visit and he said ok.  A life with your boyfriend is going be a life of submitting to his parents.  Only you can decide if you can live your life this way or if it's better to cut your losses and find a partner more compatible with your beliefs, culture, and vision for how you want to live your life.  Also consider kids because his mother's way of raising any kids is going to be the right way and you will have no say in the matter.  So you have a lot of thinking to do.  Ignore the sunk cost fallacy of 'i have three years in this relationship' as this is not about the past, but about the future.\n\nEdit: I'm being a bit harsh and making some culture presumptions in my first paragraph.  The point I'm trying to make is to understand their culture and where you stand in that because that is your status with them.  Living together before marriage is just not done.

I've seen post after post about this kind of nonsense, and it gets worse after marriage. Like, the parents expect that they'll be able to come and live with their son's family for extended amounts of time - and the daughter-in-law is essentially expected to live as a servant to the parents. They seem to expect to be able to just take over the house for months for vacations, and eventually they expect that they'll just come live with you (once they feel like they're getting up in years). I guess the thinking is, \"Well, I had to deal with being a servant to \\*my\\* mother-in-law, so now it's my turn to have a daughter-in-law who serves me.\"\n\nSo, maybe you can have a last-ditch effort at having \"listen up motherfucker\" discussion with your boyfriend, where he decides if he's willing to start standing up to his parents, or wants to lose you.

Like, there's a good chance he'll give some lip service about how he'll try to do better, etc., but I wouldn't put much stock in it.", "NTA.

I made sure from the times my kids were little to now - you can always come to me.  And they do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I have an 11-year-old living in my house and some booty call from a night out of fun is not being brought to my house while I have a child in my home.  Even when my youngest grows up - I am still a woman and I don't want a stranger in my home for the sole purpose of having sex.  I had sex when I was in my 20's and never once thought it was a great idea to take them home to do it.  I got a room - never once did I think my family wants to be included on my fun times.  Who wants an audience during sex - because it is not a quite event.  You are not protecting anyone by allowing booty calls to come to the house.  Having worked in the legal and medical field if you think allowing booty calls at the house somehow magically protects them - you may want to ask yourself - what makes that so safe?  Location does not change the safe issue at all. I told my child to be aware and know who she is dating and if she decides sex, then that is fine I don't care more power to her.  But I can say, my house is not a hotel.  Hotels have more privacy for a fun night.  That is a boundary.  My boundary does not prevent her from having sex nor does it make her sex more dangerous.  It just means that I don't have to deal with the booty call.  Just like I don't bring strange men home and having booty calls either.  In fact, I would never bring home a male to my house with my kids - children nor adults for a booty call.  I get a room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually, my daughter is a lot smarter than that - I was too as a matter of fact.  My son also an adult is smarter than that.  I got a hotel room - if you are old enough to have sex - risk STD and having a baby - then you should be old enough to pay for a room - the kids and STD treatment are lot more expensive than a motel room for the night.  My kids also know how to make arrangements to have sex where my youngest nor I having to deal with booty calls.  I raised kids who see sex as fun and acceptable, but it comes with responsibilities.  It also means it is a private thing - not something everyone needs to include on.  Home walls are pretty thin when it comes to sex.  Hearing bed springs, walls, thumps, grunts and loud Hell Yes -are not necessary for me to support my adult children in having sex.  When they come over with significant others - they have not known them - that person gets the couch.  That is a lot safer for my child than sleeping in the same bed.  So, I raised my kids keep in mind where you are and who you are around as well as who you have sex with.  You don't have sex at the beach or in a park with people around nor bring a stranger home with you to have sex with your mother and younger sister a room away.  You need to keep sex private and do it in a manner that is fun but ensures that no one else has to deal with it.  That is adulthood - that is a lesson a lot more peeps would do well to learn.  Not everyone wants to be included or see/hear two or more people making out and having sex.  It is private thing and should be treated as such.", "Oh, I didn't think of it this way! I guess because it's cultural, I see it more personally - but objectively what you're saying is true!", "Run as fast as you can!!!! If you marry this wimp, this will be your life!", "NTA\n\nThese are probably the best years of your relationship. It doesn\u2019t get better from here. Marriage will just be direct slavery for you where his family also owns you and will be a lot less nice about it. You\u2019re a young woman who can obviously support herself - I have to believe you can figure out this isn\u2019t a good fit for you. Also, prepare for the \u201cmy parents told me you\u2019d do this and you were just using me\u201d that\u2019s coming.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't how you're going to be treated after marriage!\n\nThis is the curated, nice and affable version. Once you're the DIL, you're toast, OP.\n\nHave a frank discussin with the boyfriend, give him a little time to think about your perspective, show him the thread if necessary, and if he doesn't get it, cut your losses.", "NTA \nYou need to put your foot down and tell him this isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s not a question of having to choose between you and his parents, it\u2019s ensuring he respects and consults you on big decisions like this. \nIf you do agree to let them stay, then he has to support you, he ensures they respect you as his partner. For instance, if they don\u2019t like u sleeping together, then they move out. His mother keeps out of your kitchen and shopping unless invited and she keeps her fingers to herself around your furniture. His dad also needs to keep his opinions to himself. \n\nCan you imagine what your life will be like if u get married and have children?

This is not going to change. Imagine this for the rest of your life. Is this what you really want?\n\nMove on with your life. You have a job, and you have your own place away from them. Enjoy living on your own, without anyone trying to shame you for simply existing in your space. Spend your time hanging with your friends, learning new skills, moving up the ladder at work if that's something you want,. Forget this man and his family. Make a new life for yourself. Eventually, a man that loves and respects you will come along, one that will expect his parents and family to also respect you. Until then, enjoy being single.", "NTA this is your home. They are guests. If they don't like it they can stay in a hotel.\n\nMoving your furniture???? Excluding you from buying your own groceries?? Run. Do not move in with that man. Do not marry that man.

But if you marry him this will last your whole life.", "Nta, but like a lot of posters mentioned, it's just the way it is. My husband is Indian, and I'm not. It's a good thing that his parents only visit every few years. I flat out told him that's all I can handle.

We're not cultural or religious, and his parents can't tolerate it.", "NTA, remember these are the people who brought him up, in their values.  If you do have children with him, he will treat the boys/girls like his parents treated you.    You are living apart.  You are enjoying your freedom.

This is a sign and a great opportunity to end this relationship and find someone that respects you as you are and not to bow down to what his parents want for the two of you.", "NTA and I think you know where this is going.  You have incompatible ideas, he will always put his parents first and this will never change.  Either you accept that (which I really don't recommend) or break up now before it things get too messy.", "NTA\n\nTell him it's your culture to not be treated like furniture in your own fucking home, and if they want to visit they have to behave like guests worthy of hospitality, not a bunch of entitled misogynist assholes.\n\nOr just dump him, as he clearly thinks of you as furniture.", "NTA. If he can't respect you, and won't insist on his parents respecting you, and the fact that you two are in an adult relationship, let him know that the \"when\" in \"when you move back in with him\" is not the foregone conclusion he thinks it is.\n\nYou guys are currently living separately. Do not change that until it gets sorted out by HIM, and his family, agree, explicitly, to give you the respect you deserve. If that doesn't happen, at least you'll already be set up on your own.

He can choose to change his priorities, but so far he has been CRYSTAL CLEAR that he is happy and supports his parents long and frequent visits and way of living with him. YOU are the outsider, and not one of the three of them gives much consideration to how you and your values and preferences fit in to their little trio.\n\nDo not move back with him.

Dump this arsehole, he will always love his parents more than you.", "I'm not gonna lie, when a poster has a \"family problems\" title and then say the family in question is Indian, I do a bombastic side eye. I would try not to assume irl, but at least if it's a Reddit post, I know the family's some kind of smotherer combined with outdated gender roles. I'd tell him if he isn't going to stand up for you, he can go find some poor girl who will sit there and take it, or hopefully he'd end up with a firecracker of a girl that absolutely shuts the shit down with an imposing force they can't ignore (just because it'd be fun for someone to clap back at them, not that he necessarily deserves a girl like that).

We have to make them feel comfortable\"\n\nThey are guests, so they should know how to behave respectfully.  If they can't do that they can find a hotel where they can refuse to acknowledge the staff's work and be disrespectful.  At least then the people who they treat badly will get paid for it.

It annoys me to no end how watered down that response has become on here when a random internet person with no insight to your relationship thinks you should just end multiple years of working on a relationship because of one story. So what I will say is this- you need to figure out what value you place on yourself in this relationship and determine if it's something worth continually investing in. If you think it can work, then make your BF see that you are equally valued in the decision making too. If you have doubts about it, then start to look at things objectively and figure out what you wan from your partner. Like it or not, your BFs parents are part of him and you need to figure out for yourself how you want to proceed. Keep your head up, and don't devalue yourself by giving into your partner if it doesn't feel comfortable for you. You are allowed to object to being strong armed into decisions.", "It\u2019s not really practical to just own a spare property in Australia, we have one of the most expensive property markets in the world.
