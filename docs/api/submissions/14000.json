Last weekend they would've had to keep him late, so they offered to just watch him overnight. That was all fine, they've done that before, so we didn't think anything of it.\n\nThe next morning my wife and I went to pick him up, and he looked like he hadn't slept all night. I tried to ask him what was up, but he just wanted out of there, so my wife took him to the car. I asked what was up, and my dad said that they didn't feed him the night before. I asked what he meant by that, and he said that my son said fuck when he dropped something, so as punishment they didn't give him dinner.\n\nI went out for a second to tell my wife to stay there with my son, and  went back inside and unloaded on them. They used that on my sister and I growing up. I never got in trouble much as a kid, but my sister was the classic teen rebel and that was the classic lazy parenting they used on her. She was 17 and would hide food in her room because she wasn't sure if failing a test or talking back ould get her punished. Now she's depressed and starves herself every time she feels bad, because she thinks she doesn't deserve to eat\n\nI was in there almost an hour. I called them shitty parents, I called my dad every swear word known to man. My mother told me I was being immature and said it \"wouldn't kill him\" to miss one meal, I called her a C***. By the end of it, I was beet red, my mother was sobbing, and my dad told me to get out. I was so angry I called or texted most of the family, and told them what they did, and now everyone is pissed at eachother.\n\nMy dads mom even told him how ashamed she is, she grew up poor and her parents would never do that, but the family is split on it.

Keeping your child away from that is absolutely the right move, as is cutting your parents off for being unrepentant about it.\n\nHowever, and I don't like having to say this, you're *also* modeling pretty bad behavior for your kid here. Anger can be justified, but making the conscious decision to go outside, effectively tell your wife and kid to expect you to start screaming, and then going back to yell *for an hour* for your own personal catharsis is not good behavior and is not doing anything to help your son, who is still hungry and still sitting in the car.\n\nYour parents are absolutely in the wrong, and your heart is in the right place, but ESH.", "Mild YTA, only for leaving your poor wife and son sitting in the car for an hour.

You are just as accountable for leaving your child with people you know withhold food as a form of punishment as they are for doing it to your child.", "ESH.  But the root cause of this is a whole lot of trauma.  You don't want these kids to grow up like you did, you have to keep them from that.  But you also have to think about what this says about how much rage you have inside.  This is a wake up call for you to get some therapy and take care of yourself too.", "YTA-you left your son with abusers. Clearly you feel very strongly about what they did to you and your sister, but you never told them not to do it to your son. They never apologized or acknowledged that it was bad to do to you and your sibling. \nThey suck, but you suck more for knowingly putting your son in their care.", "ESH: absolutely having skid miss meals and denying necessary nourish is absolutely not okay.

You because it is not OK to be abusive and scream at obscenities at people when you are the one that put them in the position you are angry about -- which i agree in your mind was abusive.  If your parents handled discipline by withholding meals all your life, what in the world led you to believe they wouldn't do the same with your child -- unless you'd already told them that was a no-no and they had agreed.  I understand you think they were and are terrible parents/grands, but this is a conversation you should have had with them long before now.  It sounds like you have no respect for them, but are willing to use them when it's convenient for you.  I can agree that withholding a meal can be considered abusive, but if you never had that conversation with them, why would they suddenly think after all these years that it would cause such a horrendous blow up.", "NTA. Great going dad!!", "Yta.  You know how they were. Why would you let this happen to your own son?", "ESH. For obvious reasons.", "Not cool withholding food as punishment without talking to the child's parents about it first, but you knew this was a possibility and should have talked to them about it first.

So I get it, and I\u2019m deeply sorry you went through this growing up. However, I don\u2019t think your parents thought they were doing anything that serious, they clearly didn\u2019t know you\u2019d feel this way, so if it wasn\u2019t for the trauma, but only based on the situation I\u2019d vote E S H, because you could go nuclear, yell and do the whatnots, and explain that IF they ever pulled something like this again they\u2019d be cut off the child\u2019s and your life.

They've been so desensitized to abuse that they see no issue with passing it on. \n\nIn this moment, you held them accountable. Some may say you acted irrationally.

Withholding food or forcing to eat food definitely causes life long poor relationships with food and eating disorders and other psychological trauma.", "That's true.
