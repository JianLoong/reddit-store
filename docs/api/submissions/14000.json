I tried to ask him what was up, but he just wanted out of there, so my wife took him to the car. I asked what was up, and my dad said that they didn't feed him the night before. I asked what he meant by that, and he said that my son said fuck when he dropped something, so as punishment they didn't give him dinner.\n\nI went out for a second to tell my wife to stay there with my son, and  went back inside and unloaded on them. They used that on my sister and I growing up. I never got in trouble much as a kid, but my sister was the classic teen rebel and that was the classic lazy parenting they used on her. She was 17 and would hide food in her room because she wasn't sure if failing a test or talking back ould get her punished. Now she's depressed and starves herself every time she feels bad, because she thinks she doesn't deserve to eat\n\nI was in there almost an hour. I called them shitty parents, I called my dad every swear word known to man. My mother told me I was being immature and said it \"wouldn't kill him\" to miss one meal, I called her a C***.

I was so angry I called or texted most of the family, and told them what they did, and now everyone is pissed at eachother.\n\nMy dads mom even told him how ashamed she is, she grew up poor and her parents would never do that, but the family is split on it.

Anger can be justified, but making the conscious decision to go outside, effectively tell your wife and kid to expect you to start screaming, and then going back to yell *for an hour* for your own personal catharsis is not good behavior and is not doing anything to help your son, who is still hungry and still sitting in the car.\n\nYour parents are absolutely in the wrong, and your heart is in the right place, but ESH.", "Mild YTA, only for leaving your poor wife and son sitting in the car for an hour.

But the root cause of this is a whole lot of trauma.  You don't want these kids to grow up like you did, you have to keep them from that.  But you also have to think about what this says about how much rage you have inside.  This is a wake up call for you to get some therapy and take care of yourself too.", "YTA-you left your son with abusers. Clearly you feel very strongly about what they did to you and your sister, but you never told them not to do it to your son.

You because it is not OK to be abusive and scream at obscenities at people when you are the one that put them in the position you are angry about -- which i agree in your mind was abusive.

I understand you think they were and are terrible parents/grands, but this is a conversation you should have had with them long before now.  It sounds like you have no respect for them, but are willing to use them when it's convenient for you.

If someone else is watching your child and disciplines them *without even bringing this up with you*, that's an incredibly personal line to cross.

I'm willing to bet that the grandparents have used inappropriate punishments on OP's son before this, just solely based on the son's lack of response when asked what was wrong. It wouldn't surprise me if OP's son has been covering for his grandparent's inappropriate punishments for some time now. \n\nEither way, even without this assumption, I still think no contact was a good idea.

It reads very much like a trauma response. He didn't expect it and couldn't control it. It happens and he's not to blame, but he definitely does need to follow up with some therapy because if something triggers him in public or at work, he needs better tools", "Therapy is likely needed based on how OP reacted but the one thing therapy can't do is force others to stop being shitty. Therapy teaches one to learn to overcome their personal hardships and how to remove ones self from the triggers/perpetrators or deal with them. \n\nBut I don't blame OP (not saying you do too but I also don't think OP was too far left field here). I honestly feel like if they had therapy to deal with the childhood trauma, a similar battle would have taken place because of a few things :\n\n- thinking that the trauma his parents dealt was over. Done. In the past. Never happening again\n\n- seeing the continuing and later stage results of his sister and her trauma\n\n- seeing his *son* being subjected to it\n\nKinda like seeing someone punch your kid. No therapy in the world can help a parent react appropriately all the time in those instances, hell I'd say even 9/10 there would not be a calm walk away.

Watching his sister be forced to go without eating and being a direct witness to the effect it had on her mental health has clearly and justifiably left an impact on his psyche.

He's right to ensure that doesn't happen to his own child.", "In a dissimilar event, my son got in trouble at school once and what they told me he did was not remotely similar to what he actually did: when they told me I needed to come get him and why, the infraction they told me he'd committed was an expellable offense. \n\nI was a mess. He'd never done anything remotely similar, I couldn't believe it but I assumed it was essentially the truth. \n\nWhen I found out what he actually did, which was pretty close to completely innocent--the kind of thing you get a detention for--I went absolutely ham on those people. \n\nAt the end of the day, the thing I was most satisfied with was that my son learned that I will fight *anyone* for him. When he's right--even in that case I would have supported a reasonable punishment. I will defend my child when he's in the right, and I'll support him in dealing with consequences when he's wrong. But just like this, when the authority goes that far over the line, there's no justified punishment left. The shame, hurt, embarrassment, and in this case, hunger, is plenty. \n\nShould OP talk to his kid about foul language? I have no opinion on that, we don't have enough details. \n\nSo yeah OP was harsh but child abuse is harsher. By a lot.", "Well their son turned up alright.

It may also have been several smaller incidents leading up to this catastrophic one.

DIL explained to the principal that because that\u2019s a body part, she won\u2019t forbid it but will have a talk about when and to whom it\u2019s OK to say it.

I was smart enough to know when to use these words and when not to, but they'd have me lick a bar of soap any time they heard it. I hated it so much, but I hated them controlling my speech in our private home even more. The only way I got them to stop was when I was around 13 - I said \"FUCK\" for some reason or another, and when asked to lick soap, I asked my mom very politely to \"not be a bitch about it\". Every time they told me to lick, I would curse again in a polite manner. I sat there licking soap for over half an hour before they tried to one-up me by having me take a bite of the soap, chew, and swallow.

They asked if that was enough, and I said \"Of course it fucking isn't. You're being ridiculous,\" and took another bite.
