I tried to ask him what was up, but he just wanted out of there, so my wife took him to the car. I asked what was up, and my dad said that they didn't feed him the night before. I asked what he meant by that, and he said that my son said fuck when he dropped something, so as punishment they didn't give him dinner.\n\nI went out for a second to tell my wife to stay there with my son, and  went back inside and unloaded on them. They used that on my sister and I growing up. I never got in trouble much as a kid, but my sister was the classic teen rebel and that was the classic lazy parenting they used on her. She was 17 and would hide food in her room because she wasn't sure if failing a test or talking back ould get her punished. Now she's depressed and starves herself every time she feels bad, because she thinks she doesn't deserve to eat\n\nI was in there almost an hour.

I was so angry I called or texted most of the family, and told them what they did, and now everyone is pissed at eachother.\n\nMy dads mom even told him how ashamed she is, she grew up poor and her parents would never do that, but the family is split on it.

Anger can be justified, but making the conscious decision to go outside, effectively tell your wife and kid to expect you to start screaming, and then going back to yell *for an hour* for your own personal catharsis is not good behavior and is not doing anything to help your son, who is still hungry and still sitting in the car.\n\nYour parents are absolutely in the wrong, and your heart is in the right place, but ESH.", "Mild YTA, only for leaving your poor wife and son sitting in the car for an hour.

But the root cause of this is a whole lot of trauma.  You don't want these kids to grow up like you did, you have to keep them from that.

This is a wake up call for you to get some therapy and take care of yourself too.", "YTA-you left your son with abusers.

You because it is not OK to be abusive and scream at obscenities at people when you are the one that put them in the position you are angry about -- which i agree in your mind was abusive.

I understand you think they were and are terrible parents/grands, but this is a conversation you should have had with them long before now.  It sounds like you have no respect for them, but are willing to use them when it's convenient for you.

I honestly feel like if they had therapy to deal with the childhood trauma, a similar battle would have taken place because of a few things :\n\n- thinking that the trauma his parents dealt was over. Done. In the past. Never happening again\n\n- seeing the continuing and later stage results of his sister and her trauma\n\n- seeing his *son* being subjected to it\n\nKinda like seeing someone punch your kid.

He'd never done anything remotely similar, I couldn't believe it but I assumed it was essentially the truth. \n\nWhen I found out what he actually did, which was pretty close to completely innocent--the kind of thing you get a detention for--I went absolutely ham on those people. \n\nAt the end of the day, the thing I was most satisfied with was that my son learned that I will fight *anyone* for him. When he's right--even in that case I would have supported a reasonable punishment. I will defend my child when he's in the right, and I'll support him in dealing with consequences when he's wrong.
