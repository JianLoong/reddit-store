Specifically since it\u2019s not just a girls night. Aren\u2019t her friends also (at least somewhat) your friends?

It seems unfair as other males are being invited.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nFrom the little information provided, I say NTA. Her request is justifiable if she wants a girls night out or if there isn\u2019t anyone to watch your children. I can\u2019t think of too many other reasons why she wouldn\u2019t want you there that would be understandable. It sounds like, though, she just doesn\u2019t want you there. Maybe she\u2019s worried you\u2019ll be jealous or clingy or something while out. You definitely should know why\u2026 \n\nEither way, I can\u2019t blame you for not wanting her to go out because this does seem strange.", "YTA", "NTA, if you have trust issues with her, then it\u2019s understandable why you\u2019d be upset. And the fact that it\u2019s not just a girls night.. that would bother me too.

She wants you to understand how she feels, you want her to understand how you feel. Totally normal, but challenging. Give yourselves the gift of a stronger future.", "With most of these things and the trust issues it is you not communicating that is how they made you feel when the issue came up. Did you confirm your thoughts as to being a free baby sitter ? Or did you consider getting a sitter for this?  Sounds like you are not telling her everything just saying I don\u2019t like it that you go out no you can\u2019t is not some reason that can be justified even for you.", "You know your wife better than we do.

If that means staying home with the kids while she goes out or doing the work and be arranging for a babysitter. If you really want to drink then get a cab together, but if you just want to be part of the celebration then not drinking should not be a problem.\n\n\nBtw, even people who have cheated on their post deserve friends from both sexes. If you're not past what she did in the past that's okay, but don't take it out on her.\n\nSo YTA for thinking in problems instead of solutions.", "I can't really say who is TA here but maybe she doesn't want to spend her entire birthday corralling children.

So Jodie is pretty much a guarantee.", "That\u2019s a bit of an issue as one of our kids doesn\u2019t do well with sitters and have had to end dates early to pick him up.

I suppose IATA for not being more proactive with the latter. It\u2019s still a little ways off, later this month, and hadn\u2019t gotten to that. I have some thinking to do on that.", "Yeah I get that honestly. My last birthday I went out by myself. An entire year of being main parent and added the fact that for some reason family outings always end with me being incredibly stressed and ready to cry while everyone else has fun. Absolutely not, I wanted to get drunk and not be home by bedtime.", "Seriously! OP look at it from her guy friends' perspective. Have you ever tried talking to a girl and had her husband there, refusing to give you two space to get to know each other? It's extremely annoying.", "OP has said a babysitter is not an option.", "I think we could safely add to this can you afford a sitter and for birth people to go out.", "they have no one to babysit the kids, he\u2019s moved them away from their family because of active duty and one of their kids doesn\u2019t do well with babysitters.", "For sure. It\u2019s odd though. If he\u2019s worried about her going out, that implies she\u2019s been unfaithful, but I don\u2019t know why he wouldn\u2019t just say that. If it was him, I can see why he\u2019s being vague, but it doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019s so worried.

If they aren\u2019t around, we don\u2019t go out together without the kids.  \n\nSometimes that means I get dinner / drinks with my girlfriends \u2014 or  he goes on bike rides with his friends and they grab beers after.  \n\nNo need to be jealous or weird about it. It\u2019s important to have kid-free time, and if the only way you can do that rn is separately, you make it work.", "Okay, you answered the last and easiest question. Why is your wife afraid to directly ask you to watch the kids for the night? (This is still INFO, not passing judgment.)", "You mean the outing you say will amount to coralling the kids? So you didn't plan a fun day for her and you're upset that her friends did but you're not included?", "Maybe try slowly introducing a sitter over the next few weeks?", "What's it like to be this insecure? Genuinely curious.", "I laughed out loud.", "Hadn't thought of the latter, you might be onto something. Guess we'd know if OP would answer anyone asking that in particular lol", "Doesn\u2019t seem like OP wants her going out at all. Not without him. Sad.", "Equally she hasn't made any effort to include him. I'm leaning ESH, those isn't how a functioning relationship works.", "Why should she? He's the dad, they both know they don't use babysitters. If one is going out, it's obvious the other is with the kids. It doesn't mean she afraid to ask.", "lol, right? The more he ignores the question(s) the more I assume he\u2019s the cheater, so he\u2019s not doing himself any favors by it.", "True, but it's her birthday.  She shouldn't be the one making all the effort", "Even if thats not the case, I'm for her. I'm biased as hell but I spent my last birthday without my child or partner bc I was so tired of \"my\" events being taken over by a baby being pushed on me everytime she cries even though her father is in the same room and the lack of being able to sit and eat my own food on my birthday for more than a singular minute at a time in 30 min intervals was just not happening after spending my previous birthday pregnant lmao.", "She arranged the event. Her arranged a family do for her, and she went and arranged the event without him. It's not about her not having to do anything on her birthday.\n\nThis sub is hilarious."]}
