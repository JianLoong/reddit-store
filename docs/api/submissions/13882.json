Did you confirm your thoughts as to being a free baby sitter ? Or did you consider getting a sitter for this?

If it was him, I can see why he\u2019s being vague, but it doesn\u2019t explain why he\u2019s so worried.

It\u2019s important to have kid-free time, and if the only way you can do that rn is separately, you make it work.", "Okay, you answered the last and easiest question. Why is your wife afraid to directly ask you to watch the kids for the night? (This is still INFO, not passing judgment.)", "You mean the outing you say will amount to coralling the kids?

Sad.", "Equally she hasn't made any effort to include him. I'm leaning ESH, those isn't how a functioning relationship works.", "Why should she? He's the dad, they both know they don't use babysitters. If one is going out, it's obvious the other is with the kids. It doesn't mean she afraid to ask.", "lol, right?

She shouldn't be the one making all the effort", "Even if thats not the case, I'm for her. I'm biased as hell but I spent my last birthday without my child or partner bc I was so tired of \"my\" events being taken over by a baby being pushed on me everytime she cries even though her father is in the same room and the lack of being able to sit and eat my own food on my birthday for more than a singular minute at a time in 30 min intervals was just not happening after spending my previous birthday pregnant lmao.", "She arranged the event. Her arranged a family do for her, and she went and arranged the event without him. It's not about her not having to do anything on her birthday.\n\nThis sub is hilarious.", "If you go, that means she can\u2019t because of the sitter issue and you both know it.  Her including you would make it that the event won\u2019t happen at all.  So your getting in your feelings about this is essentially saying she can\u2019t go out and have an adult good time on her birthday.  Yes, YTA.  You are being very selfish.  \n\nActive duty military usually means the spouse suffers because the military member\u2019s career is prioritized over everything.  She\u2019s somehow made good friends anyway.  She shouldn\u2019t also have to give up any good time because it doesn\u2019t center you.  \n\nAnd miss me with the \u201cfamily fun\u201d birthday.  If it doesn\u2019t count for you to enjoy because the kids are a lot, it surely doesn\u2019t count for her to enjoy for the same reason.  She can be the priority for once on her birthday.  It\u2019s not about you.", "She wants an adult night out to celebrate her birthday. I don't see the issue. \n\nYTA\n\nAlso why does she have to ask permission? If she wants to go out without you then that is her choice", "This all feels fishy but I will take it at face value:\n\nNTA for feeling left out, which is what the OP asked for judgement on.\n\nTwo things:\n\n* You need to get a sitter. You need to go. If your kid freaks out and you have to return then **you** return, don't guilt her or try to change the game at that point. \"*Great, I am coming. We will get a sitter and if they call I will go home, you stay and enjoy it.\"* You can't go the rest of your kid's childhood not going out together. \n* If you are active you have access to all kinds of marriage counseling. I would take advantage. You guys not trusting each other (or one not trusting the other) is hard to get over w/o outside help. Good luck dude.", "This isn't an AITA issue.  This is an 'y'all need couples counselling' issue.\n\nThere's not enough information here to unpack all of the bits, ranging from 'what, did she cheat on you' to 'why do you, OP, think that couples have to do everything together?'", "YTA. It\u2019s her birthday. You don\u2019t have a sitter so both of you can go out. I understand feeling left out (though I think there more to it than this) but barring any further information she should be able to have a night out with her friends.", "YTA- it sounds like she is not delibrately excluding you, there just isn't a viable option of you joining the celebration because of the kids. Also, it is understandable that she wants to take a break from family life and spend time doing other things she enjoys, especially if that is not a chance she gets often. \n\nThat said, you should work on those trust issues.", "I'd vote YTA as you have chosen to forgive whatever happened 2 years ago, so you can't say you agree to give another chance if you don't trust them to go out without you. If you can't move beyond that, you need to think if this relationship works and if you have truly forgiven them?", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re acting like the issue is that she wants to go out with friends without you being invited but then admit in the comments you cannot leave your kids with a sitter, meaning her choices are without you or not going at all. It\u2019s her birthday. Stop trying to isolate her.", "There are two ways to look at this: first, your wife is asking for a kid-free evening as a birthday present, which is not a big deal. But I think the reason this rankles is because there\u2019s another way to look at it: your wife wants you excluded from a social function being held in her honor. \n\nI\u2019ll probably get creamed for this, but NTA. The kid who who can\u2019t be left with a sitter is also her kid, so also her problem. (I\u2019m not passing judgment on some of your comments about *why* the kid can\u2019t have a sitter, I\u2019m just treating the lack of a sitter as a fact.)\n\nIf my spouse said to me, \u201chey soooo I know we can\u2019t have sitters, but I still want to have an adult-only party at a local joint, so will you stay home while I go out and have fun with our friends on my birthday? By the way, everyone else can bring their spouses/SO,\u201d I would be PISSED. It\u2019s not about watching the kids or giving the spouse a break. It\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s mean! For example, if I myself threw a party and invited your wife but not you, it would be straight-up rude. So I don\u2019t know why your wife is being just as rude to you?", "NTA if it were a girls night and you wanted to go, that would be odd and she should be able to go out without you but not inviting you out when it's both men and women seems a bit odd...I would question it, even without trust issues.", "Info:\n\n\nAs you have  no babysitters- do you ever go out alone? With friends?", "omg let her enjoy her birthday", "YTA. My husband and I love each other dearly, but we each appreciate friend time without the other.

Sometimes we all need some time like this.", "Without background information no decision will be made. You both sound unhealthy.", "YTA it's her birthday.

What are the trust issues? Why do you think she was asking you to stay home rather than asking you to come with and find a sitter? It sounds like there are a lot of assumptions being made and not a lot of communication being had.", "INFO: so who cheated? Why are you not replying to any of the comments asking you about what caused the trust issues?", "YTA - You left out key details like there is no babysitter and someone needs to watch the kids.", "YTA. You're kidding, right? She isn't asking to leave you out but because you have children. Isn't this the normal approch here? Well, for us it is.", "NTA, OP I\u2019d get the divorce papers ready for sure. Once a cheater always a cheater", "YTA-If you can't/won't let your wife go out with friends, your marriage is doomed.", "NTA if this is her actual celebration and instead of getting a sitter she is just flat-out not inviting you (and, like you say, it isn't a girl's night.)  She doesn't seem to like you all that much, maybe some serious communication is needed.", "Op answered these questions in other comments\n\n\nNo, he only planned something for the kids. \n\n\nNo, the kids don't do well with strangers and they live aqay from family because of his job.", "Op commented no one can babysit as there is no family around and one kid has adhd. \n\n\nSo she just hopes she can go out at all.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong that the husband is annoyed at not being invited but we need more details", "It\u2019s not odd to not invite OP, when they\u2019ve admitted, in the comments that one of the children can\u2019t be left with a babysitter. Who would watch the kids if both parents go?", "So, what I'm seeing here is you don't want her to go out and have fun without the kids, ever?  Either you take turns going out so you both get a break (which is exactly what she is trying to do) or you are both chained endlessly to your children until they are old enough to be left alone - and neither of you can have a fun outlet of any kind because you don't want to feel left out?", "Why are there trust issues?  You haven't been answering that.  Are you worried it'll go against you if you say you're the one who cheated?  And if you haven't, why not just come out with it?", "So she wants to go out for her birthday, which everyone should agree is normal and totally fine. \n\nYou guys don't have good babysitting options. \n\nTherefore you must stay home with the kids if she goes out. \n\nWhy are you turning a logistical issue into an emotional conflict? Surely, she must be the one watching the kids when you are not home. \n\nYTA.", "Not when you have kids and no good babysitting options. You take turns staying home and going put with friends. OP YTA", "You\u2019re hilarious, nobody said she planned the thing with her friends, for all we know they planned it for her. If he wants special time with his wife on her bday, he needs to create that environment and time. It\u2019s not her responsibility on her bday to make sure her husband isn\u2019t sad because he\u2019s watching the kids for her to have one night out with friends. That\u2019s pretty ridiculous"]}
