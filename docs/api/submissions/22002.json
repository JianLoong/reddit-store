Bit disappointing the venue security didn't step in.", "NTA. \n\nThe standing and dancing obnoxiously, holding signs, shouldn't be a thing. There are other people other than them. I am short, so the man in front of me blocks the view. I was at a show last month where a group in their 20s were standing, dancing obscene. Well, that blocked a couple of kids who were upset. \n\nAs my father says to us, \"The show is not you. It's the person on stage.\"\n\nBlocking a shit ton of others for a sign (the entertainer gives no shits about) is rude. Could you have asked for him to lower it? Yes. But at the same time, he could have had common sense.", "NTA\n\nGod, concerts have gotten **_awful_**.\n\nSit down, shut up, and listen to the performance.

Did you ask them to lower it first?", "Absolutely NTA. What kind of inconsiderate BLEEPING BLEEPWAD waves a stupid BLEEPING sign that blocks everyone's view that the performer isn't going to effin' see?!

Bravo! NTA.", "YTA. This is why there is security in concerts, you don\u2019t get to police the crowd on your own. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t start a fight.", "YTA. No one put you in charge. Taking the sign was theft. You should have had security handle it by telling them to put it down or leave the event.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
