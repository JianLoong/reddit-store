Your friends are AHs.  You are NTA and well done on taking in four children and giving them a good home.", "If the children are happy how is it any of your friends business. I would make sure that baby number 2 got some therapy because he might have some abandonment issues. But other than that keep up the good work.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Logan is 14. Assuming some one involved (social worker, you, a judge) asked him if he wanted to live with his biological siblings and aunt or stay with his foster parents and his wishes were taken into account, I really can\u2019t see how anyone else thinks they know better. Now if Logan was dragged kicking and screaming from a stable foster family he loved, then I\u2019d vote differently.\n\nIn terms of staying in the UK or bringing all the kids to the US - either your job and social network could support that or it couldn\u2019t. Obviously in an ideal world all parents would be able to care for their children and kids wouldn\u2019t need to be uprooted but when that\u2019s not the case, kids tend to do better with family - even if that means moving - than with strangers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You did amazing by getting all those kids out of the system and giving them a safe place filled with love. You say the kids are happy, in therapy, and school? It sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job. Moving countries is difficult, but it seems like all the kids are comfortable with the change.\n\nEdit to add: why would you be an AH for bringing the. Brothers together? If they\u2019re happy then there if no issue. If they found out later in life that you knew, it would cause problems.", "NTA. You are honestly going to give these children a great environment where they can grow. And being able to reunite the twins is honestly an amazing thing to have done. I hope you all have a wonderful life together in the US", "from the info presented NTA.  \nThis is \"am I the angel\" type stuff. I have no doubt this will end up there. What possible reason could you be the AH from this story as presented? Is it because you took them so soon, that's all procedural, not up to you though. 6 months doesn't seem enough of a chance for the mom to get her stuff together and get the kids back. Why were you allowed to take them out of the country? Why aren't they on child protection plans? How did this all happen so fast? You'd be a kinship carer right? I am growing increasingly suspicious about this post. Are you lying for karma? That would be very low indeed.", "NTA - you have done something amazing and beautiful for these kids. I was a foster carer in the UK and good as my care was and as much as I loved them, it would never have been the same as being cared for by a loving family member.

You moved countries, yeah, so what? It's not like they had anyone else in the UK to take them on. In fact, your sister was so irresponsible that she had 5 children, gave one to an incapable friend without anyone knowing, and then had CPS take her other children years later. The kids are adjusting, going to school, getting treatment? Yet your somehow the AH for taking then away from a life of loneliness and pain? How the hell does that work????", "NTA. Your doing a wonderful thing which many people would not either because of the financial implications or the disruption to their lives. Tell your \u201cfriends\u201d you only want positive vibes. Good luck", "It\u2019s an awful way to grow up in the UK too", "I have never had any experience of foster care either here or in the UK but from what Logan has told me it wasn\u2019t great. He has lived in group homes where they would lock their bedroom doors from the outside at night. That broke my heart. He had a bag of bears that they give the kids every time they go to court when they are little. He gave one to Hannah and left the rest behind in the UK", "That breaks my heart. You definitely did the right thing. Anyone who says otherwise is not compassionate, caring, or empathetic."]}
