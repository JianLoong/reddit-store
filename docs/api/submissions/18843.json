We brought the kayaks the first year we had them, the cousins asked if they could try them, so my kids allowed them to borrow one, and they basically took it out the rest of the afternoon, stranding one of my kids without their kayak. \n\nLast year, we dropped several hints to SIL leading up to the party (oh, this store has a great deal on kayaks!) but the response was \u201cWhy would we buy them if we can just use yours? We only would use them once a year. Etc\u201d Last year, the same exact thing happened as the first, but after about an hour on the lake, I yelled to the cousins to bring the kayak back so my son could use it again.

Or you can give SIL some kayak rental locations and everyone can go out on the lake. \n\nBut make sure you're getting the kids out on the lake an extra day if you're not doing it at the party.", "NTA.  I hate when people say \"Why should I get x if you have it\" as if my personal property has become community property.  If anything happened to one of those kayaks you know they would not pay to replace it.\n\nSo leave it at home, make an excuse, you didn't have room, it was too much trouble, what have you.  You don't owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nWhat do your sons think? Are they fine with not bringing the kayaks and avoiding the drama of previous years, or would they still like to Go out in them? Are you staying with them? Can you bring kayaks and use at the lake the day before or after the party?", "NTA, but I would plainly and politely tell my sister in law that unless she rents or purchases kayaks for her kids your sons won\u2019t be brining theirs. If she pushed back tell her it\u2019s unfair for your kid to not have their kayak for hours. It\u2019s not a negotiation, she\u2019s gets her kids kayaks or no kayaks.", "[deleted]", "Depends on what your kids want whether you WBTA or not.\n\nTalk to your kids and see what they say.  What do they want to do and are they willing to share? Under what conditions are they willing to share?\n\nI understand your reasoning, but the kayaks belong to your kids.  If they do not want their cousins borrowing the kayaks, then call your sister and explain the kayaks are coming but will not be shared this year.  If she wants her kids to kayak, then she should buy her own.\n\nOR they can share the kayaks after they are done using them.  Their kayaks they go first. Your sister should be able to understand this.\n\nOr some other solution that I have not thought of... there is a lot of wiggle room here.  It's not either share or they do not go.\n\nHinting is not working, so you will need to step up as a parent and explain what the lay of the land is concerning the kayaks and the use or non use of them for the cousins.\n\n>Last year, the same exact thing happened as the first, but after about an hour on the lake, I yelled to the cousins to bring the kayak back so my son could use it again. BIL and SIL were quiet the rest of the party, clearly annoyed with me, but didn\u2019t say anything else.\n\nThis is good parenting.  Full stop. You allowed them to share the kayaks for an hour then it was time for your kid to use his kayak.", "Nta if anything this would be a learning opportunity for everyone else to not rely on you to have a kayak if they want to go kayaking and if you feel bad for your kids maybe the week after this meetup take them on their own without the rest of them (if possible)", "NTA. I don't like that this person is all \"Why would be buy them, we'd only use them once a year!\" I think you should say, \"Well, we DID buy them and we can't even use them once a year because your kids have them. My kids are using their Kayaks this year, if you want your kids to kayak, You can rent or buy some.\" I mean, I'd say it nicer than that somewhat, but let her know that now this is also basically the only time your kids use them so they really look forward to it.", "You would not be the a-hole for depriving your SIL's kids of using them, but it would be unfair to not even let your own kids use them. I would tell the in-laws beforehand that you're bringing them for your own kids to use and if their kids want to kayak, they need to buy or rent them their own.", "NTA, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for you not to bring the kayaks. you don\u2019t need to deprive your kids of fun they could have just because your in laws are too cheap to buy their own and overly dependent on your things. rather, this is the perfect opportunity to establish that YOU bought those kayaks for YOUR kids and if their cousins want to use them too, your in laws will have to get their own. better to get to the front of the problem now then skirt around the problem and let them think your stuff is free game", "NTA i would\u2019ve been annoyed too. Your BIL/SIL need to teach their kids to share", "Lots of great advice here. In addition to being more direct\u2026 I personally would get them gift cards to the shop that sells them and write, \u201cMerry Christmas/Happy Birthday - here\u2019s to use towards your very own kayak!

If so then take them but set firm boundaries about how they share. Cousins get them for 1/4 of the day, kids get them for 3/4 or something that suits.\n\n Last year your kids got them most of the time? And the only issue was your entitled sil/bil? Then seems like it worked out ok. They know what is going to happen this year.", "YWNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither don't bring them, or - even better - tell your kids that they won't have to share their kayaks. Protecting your kids is much better than punishing your kids for YOUR unwillingness to stand up to SIL. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop hinting! Tell SIL: My kids will use their kayaks themselves, so if you want your kids to have some, too, YOU Will need to bring some for them.", "Good points. I need to be more intentional about planning lake days anyway, so that\u2019s great advice. Thank you.", "My older son told them no, straight up, each time they ask. My younger son is a sweetheart, but also a pushover that wants everyone to be happy, so he\u2019s the one that\u2019s been stranded. I\u2019ll ask him more specifically how he feels about it, and will approach the subject with them of just not bringing them. I just don\u2019t want to introduce potential bad blood by framing it the wrong way.", "THIS !!!! Put on your big dad pants and deal with your SIL if your kids want their kayaks more than they care about cousin drama.

Thanks for the feedback.", "Maybe I\u2019m just thinking I\u2019ll cut it off at the head, but you\u2019re right. They should have the most say in it.", "I appreciate the thoughtful response here, several great points that I\u2019m definitely going to incorporate. I think a lot of it comes down to me being more direct ahead of time, not just letting it fester and annoy me. I\u2019ll also talk to the kids in a way that doesn\u2019t introduce a complex about their cousins, I\u2019ll have to figure that out. Thank you again.", "Ah, the good old player two syndrome. My second kid is a pushover too. I blame my oldest for that ;)", "NTA. Drive it home with sis.   Say something like\u2026two kayaks and 6(?) kids doesn\u2019t work well, so I told the boys we would bring them back to the lake in a few weeks so they could use them.", "You could flip it around and ask the in laws what they\u2019re bringing for entertainment for the lake \u2018because you want to make sure there\u2019s enough for all the kids to be entertained\u2019 - without saying that it\u2019s about the kayaks.
