She said she talked to the company and they were willing to hire her again under the same conditions and that we would have to plan financially for me to stay at home. \n\nI was very honest and paraphrasing, I said: \"Look, I know that our plans were these in the beginning, but we were only able to have this comfortable life because of my salary, if we depend only on yours, it will totally compromise our income and not give us the the same quality of health for our son. I'm sorry, but you being the sole provider in the house is not possible and I'm not going to do this with our son.\" \n\nDay care is not an option for us because my wife is completely against it due to the bad reputation of these places in my country and it has always been her wish to only enroll in school at the age of 4. \n\nShe argued saying that it was our agreement and that she supported me being at home and now it's my turn to give her that chance. \n\nMe: \"I understand and if it were the situation we expected I would agree and do it, but that's not our reality and I'm not going to do that with our son and you'll have to wait a little longer, unfortunately.\"\n\n She was very upset, saying that I went back on our initial agreement and wasn't committing to something. \n\nMy work is not possible from home, I just don't see how making this change would compromise our family financially. I admit that maybe it was a failure in our communication, but on the day-to-day rush...\n\nAITA?\n\nAdded: Make it very clear that she doesn't want our child to have a nanny or stay in a childcare all dau, she wants someone to stay with him until he is 4 years old. For this idea, I can't stop working for her to come back.", "created_utc": 1696857449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173rkwr/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_she_will_have_to/", "score": 1272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You two have to deal with it now. My advice would be to make two spreadsheets, one of your finances currently and one simulation of your wifes income as household income. Could you survive as a family on that money? What would you have to give up in that case? (payments for healthcare, car, house etc. you couldnt afford anymore) I very much understand your wife being sad/angry if she imagined for the past years to work again now , being a SAHP is hard. But i also understand that you dont to downsize your lifestyle if its about 'food or appointment with sons specialist' and not about 'cant afford vacation nr. 3 this year'.", "NAH\n\nYour side of this is completely understandable, but I think you also need to remember that you were both on the same salary before your son. It is only now that you've had those extra two years to focus on your career that there is so much difference financially. The longer your wife has to stay home, the more this disparity will be and the harder it will be for her to restart her career and be able to make the same career advances that you have. \n\nHave you considered that if your wife were to go back to work for those two years, she may also be able to achieve the promotions you have achieved to once again match your salary? If so, is there some way you can make it work financially between now and then that will give her this chance? \n\nIt really isn't fair for you to expect her to forego her career just because you've had the chance to advance yours further while she's been staying home with your son, especially when you had this agreement in place.", "NAH. \n\nHOWEVER this should\u2019ve been discussed once your son was around 6 months old.", "NAH \n\nI'm so sorry that your son has a birth injury and your country has inadequate health care. This is just a terribly difficult situation. But you can't unilaterally make this decision, and you need to weigh the lost future income for your wife as well as her care-giver burnout. \n\nI think, in these situations, it's important to know that there are no GOOD solutions, just less bad ones. \n\nLook at the big picture of what you need to do for your family, and make a decision together, knowing that no one is going to be exactly happy with it.", "And this is why I hate making agreements years in advance and never do them, because something that is entirely out of your control can fuck it up and make the agreement completely unfeasible when it\u2019s time.\n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA but I can understand why your wife is hurt too. You make good points, you simply do NOT have the financial capacity for her to to be the sole provider with her wages alone. Her being the primary caretaker is also probably a big mental strain on her though.\n\nIt\u2019s possible there might be some middle ground here, a nanny perhaps? Either way, leaving your job entirely and be reliant on hers which earns considerably is just not a smart move here. Best of luck that you two can figure something out.", "I see her side. She sacrificed her career and another 2 years she won\u2019t have the job or the gap in experience will make it hard to find another job. \n\nNo one is exploring option B. You let her work and one or both of you take a side huddle for extra income. This should be short term as she will catch up on income.", "NAH - however the mater of fact nature of your response leaves out that ***you*** still get to go into the world and interact with other adults as well as seek and accomplish work goals and promotions. **You get to grow while she remains professionally stagnant for another 2 years.** Making it that much more difficult for her to close the professional gap she\u2019s incurred by staying home.\n\nAnd she agreed to this, no question. And motherhood and working from the home are both very real jobs. **But goodness gracious, could you disregard her very real feelings more?** Your response essentially boils down to *\u2019life\u2019s tough kid\u2019* with a slap on the back.", "Attending daycare is very good for a child. I've seen children at my children's school who didn't attend daycare cry and refuse to go to school and be away from their parents.\n\nDaycare helps grow children's confidence and help them learn to create friendships. \n\nIf your child goes to daycare, then you will have two incomes.", "NAH these things happen and it\u2019s really hard.  Neither side is wrong.  I was like your wife - nobody but family watched my son until he started pre-school.  It was SO HARD to drop him at the school with strangers.  I cried for like three days.  I wish i would\u2019ve let myself get used to it by hiring a sitter once in a while.  Maybe you could start with a few date nights and see if she gets comfortable with it?", "NTA for the reasons, but I think **telling** her she\u2019ll have to wait is where you kinda lose me. It seems very authoritative, and not what a partnership does. \n\nI think a better approach would have been to discuss the pay difference and ask her how it would be made up if you leave your job. How would you three live with that shortfall and what does that look like to your household? She probably would come to the same conclusion herself, instead of being \u2018told\u2019. \n\nI don\u2019t fault you for your position. It sucks that things didn\u2019t work out as planned and I hope your kid overcomes his health issues.\n\nYour wife needs to make some choices. I get that 4 years off work is a kiss of death, but something has to lose - be it her position on the nanny, her job, etc. what she wants isn\u2019t possible right now.", "ESH. \n\nYou are not the boss - you are a partner.  You don't get to decide on your own.  You made an agreement with her and now you are backing out.\n\nOn the other hand, your wife insisting on no nanny is unreasonable.  If she wants to work, she should be able to work, but to insist you stick to the original agreement is perhaps unreasonable.\n\nThe two of you need to take a step back and talk about what you want out of your life together and make decisions based on that vision - not whether there was an agreement, or whether a nanny is a good idea or a bad one.", "You got promotions or payraises because you worked. She could not earn them when she was not worjing. Her pay will always stay much lower then yours if she contineus to stay home with the jid. That will effect her entire financial future. Please bare this in mind when deciding about y'alls options. Maybe both work 3 days a week? Compromise. Being a SAHP is not a financial smart decicion for future financial reasons", "Is it not possible for you both to work part-time?", "You never should have agreed to that deal. You need to have a realistic talk with your wife about childcare. ESH but you more because you are trying to back out of your agreement", "See this from her pov.  It must be very frustrating for her that you\u2019re going back on what you agreed and throwing finances at her as a reason for you to not look after your child. \n\nLook at alternatives to a nursery if she\u2019s so against them. What about a nanny who can give your child consistent one-2-one care?", "And you waited 1.5 years after your child was born to have this conversation?\n\nLook, there\u2019s NAH. But your guys\u2019 communication needs work. You should have been discussing this from Day 1 when your child had health problems.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like a discussion at all, you sat down and told her \"what's what's\", you made a decision without involving her at all. That's shitty and not a way to treat your partner. \n\nYou should have come to her and told her your worries about finances and then made a decision together. You could have told her your feelings on staying with your income and asked how she felt, you may even have been able to work out a way she could go back to work, but you closed off any discussion. \n\nShit way to treat your wife buddy.", "ESH. A deal was made and now it is being broken. You two need to sit down and work it out and someone is going to have to compromise.\n\n\nYou're right not to want to negatively impact your sons health but it appears you didn't really give her a chance to try and find a different solution, you just set the terms and want her to be happy with it.", "NTA, saying this as a woman and mother. She needs to compromise. You couldn\u2019t predict the future. You can tell how many of these answers come from people who either don\u2019t have children or never had a child with medical needs or medical debt. She can go back to work, you said you offered a nanny or child care. I would go the nanny route. I fully understand not wanting to leave your child with someone, especially when they aren\u2019t communicating yet (I had the same anxiety) and I also understand her wanting to work (went thru the same emotions, I am a SAHM).  So I can truly empathize with her, but your situation has changed and she\u2019s being unfair. )You didn\u2019t specify regarding your child\u2019s health, so I am just assuming here.) But having a child with medical needs, is costly.  You have no idea what other medical needs will pop up, will they need long term care, will they need care as an adult, because those will be things you have to plan and save for. Why don\u2019t you try living off what she would make for the next few months. Show her how it would be, and set the other money aside to save. She will either see it isn\u2019t feasible, or it might actually work.", "YTA.  I get that there may be a need to make adjustments with the change in circumstances.  However it doesn't sound like you are making much effort to reach a solution with her and instead are just laying down the law about how it's going to be.  Considering you did have an agreement that's not going to land well.", "I don't like that you've made a unilateral decision on this. I understand the finances but crippling your wife's career without her consent is an AH move and especially so with a medically complex child. If anything happens to you your wife will have problems going back to work. I sincerely urge you to find a way to get her to work.          \nThat being said you're both handling this as a you vs her problem and it's not. You both need to reframe this as you both, as parents and partners, vs the problem. The problem is how to accommodate your wife going to work. You both need to drop the previous agreement and go into this with the mindset of a two income family instead of a fantasy swapping session.           \nEdit: I'm going ESH", "YTA\n\nFirst, because you made an agreement with her that her career would be on pause, not shut-down indefinitely. The longer she waits to go back the harder it will be to recover her career and catch up to where she would have been without the gap.  \n\n\nMoreso, YTA for *telling* her that you will not stay home and allow her to return to work. You're a family unit and need to treat each other as equals. You can certainly tell her that you value the greater financial stability of your current position over her desire to return to the office and above your integrity in keeping an agreement. Then you can discuss and come to a consensus together. What you can't do - what neither of you should do - is make demands.", "Here's the thing I learned as a SAHM for 20 years: it's not all about the $$. I am college-educated. Husband and I both worked prior. Some things happened during pregnancy and after she was born, we both decided it made financial sense for me to stay home.\n\nI have lost 20 years of earnings. I have no current marketable skills. The only reason I have money in Social Security is because of the decade of work I did prior. I am now 53 and desperately wanting to get out of the house and start a career, but who is going to hire me? Do I go back to school with 20-yr-olds? I couldn't leave my marriage if I had wanted to because the choice we made 20 years ago irreparably harmed my financial and career goals. IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE. Maybe your wife will have to come to terms with a nanny or daycare, maybe you can find a different position or company, lots of things to consider, but the relentless work and loneliness, not to mention toll it takes mentally and financially, absolutely needs to be considered. Her losing her future options because you make a few extra bucks is NOT a good enough reason for her to sacrifice herself.", "INFO: Have you looked into hiring an au pair or a nanny so you don't have to enroll your son in daycare? If the two of you are working it should be possible to pay for.", "You shouldn\u2019t have just told her, you should have had an an actual conversation about possible options. Why don\u2019t you try to get a job where you can work from home? That way she can still go back to work. NAH", "YTA.   You\u2019ve gotten promotions because your wife stayed at home and enabled you to do that.   It\u2019s her turn.   This is how so many women get sidelined.   Time for you to get a side hustle if you want to continue to live in the way you\u2019ve gotten accustomed to.", "NTA, Unfortunately we can plan for things before they happen and agree on circumstances and situations.  Your son was born with specific health needs/issues which in turn changed what you need to provide for financially.  If this is truly about money and not about learning to take care of his needs then you are NTA.  Life can't always be pre planned, we can plan, but unfortunately things happen and we have to be adaptable.  Couldn't she return to work after your son starts attending school/preschool?", "YTA.

If she wants to go back to work (which is perfectly reasonable), then you need to put your child into daycare. \n\nI reject the premise that daycare is not an option. I simply don't believe that your country doesn't have quality daycare, somewhere. \n\nYou might have to do some leg work to find the right fit for your son, but this honestly feels like a false binary.\n\nAny country with some percentage of working parents has quality daycare. It almost feels like you are just claiming that it isn't an option because it is the obvious solution to the problem.", "Esh only because of how you sound you came off.

The alternatives are going to make you all lose out.", "ESH: Yall could have figured this out any time in the last 1.5 years.", "What if she stays at home for two more years and then the baby still needs one of the parents to be a SAH due to frequent visits to specialists? Does that mean his wife never gets to reenter the workforce? What if even with a nanny, a parent still has to be on call because of healthcare appointments? I don't know the extent of the health issues but the wife has made her sacrifices while the husband built his career. Her turn has come but her is going back on their deal. I can feel her resentment for the child that robbed her of a career she enjoyed. \nHealth issues don't always get better. Sometimes they get worse. Then there will be even more reason for one parent to stay on call, full time, even with daycare/childcare.", "NTA\n\nMake a spreadsheet and then hold back money for a month or two if you agree to test how you can survive on her salary. \n\nYou\u2019ll need the extra money as a buffer anyway.", "NAH. It's not like you're saying she can't go back to work. Just that she has to wait a few more years (bc of her own refusal to get childcare).", "NAH. You guys were thrown a curve ball. Expectations need to change. It makes no sense to financially get into trouble or not have as good of healthcare as is needed now. I get your points and I get your wife's points. Do a breakdown financially for her and talk possible solutions. She may need to budge a bit on care for your son. You may need to budge on hours worked. A compromise should be found.", "plans dont hold up if the unexpected happens.NTA", "1-NTA. It's smart. \n2- she's probably feeling pretty trapped in the home as main caregiver for a special needs baby. You just took away the light at the end of the tunnel. Be kind. Offer as much compromise as possible. Be absolutely sure to create space for her to be in charge of no one and no thing at least one day every single week. Being a mom is effing hard. And that's when the child is healthy and in good spirits. It's just really hard to not let your entire self get caught up in your kid. Especially if she enjoyed her job, I can understand being upset about extending her hiatus. Be kind, make space. Honestly? Let her yell and scream and fuss at you for a bit to get it out. She doesn't necessarily want to yell at you, but she needs to scream and it's much harder to scream at god or the universe which shifted your planned situation. Be her partner. Have her back while she processes this. And don't be snarky or make her feel bad. Please try to understand her.", "NTA. The original agreement was made based on the financial situation at that time and a healthy child. Now with the medical costs the financial costs has changed. I understand her wanting to go back to work. But ignoring the new finance and willing to accept the lower household income is what\u2019s baffling me.

Not only are you breaking your agreement but you\u2019re now imposing your decisions on her. However seeing as you\u2019re not actually against her going back to work and more so against her refusal to compromise. I would say that you are NTA. \n\nYour previous agreement was made with the assumption that your child would be healthy- and from what you\u2019ve written you\u2019d have no issue keeping to it if that were the case. However having a child with special needs has derailed that plan entirely. \n\nAs the child grows, the cost for medication and care will too, and assuming you\u2019re in the US, thats a cost that you\u2019ll have to shoulder entirely by yourselves. It also doesn\u2019t help that cost of living has risen significantly which could also impact what you\u2019ve previously thought out for you future. \n\nIf you have made the calculations and the information you provided is true. It isn\u2019t feasible and in my opinion ethical to put your child through unnecessary hardship. Your promotions have allowed for your child to be provided for- something you two won\u2019t be able to accomplish for a while should you quit and she become the sole breadwinner. Your wife\u2019s re-entry into the workforce and your stepping down will have you in a negative financial situation- one that could be avoided if you either: \n\n1. Continue to be the breadwinner while she continues to be a SAHP or\u2026\n\n2. You both pick up work and hire a nanny or put your child in specialised care. (Best option for all parties involved in my opinion)\n\nThe issue here is that your wife isn\u2019t willing to compromise for the sake of your child. Her unwillingness to accept a nanny/care service is very illogical in my opinion- a double income would do wonderfully for both your savings for your child and for any aforementioned difficulties up ahead. And she would be able to get back into work and progress her career; to me this wold be the best outcome for everyone. \n\nShe is trying to eat her cake and have it and she is also being incredible inflexible at this moment. The ideal situation she wants really isn\u2019t possible without someone suffering along the way and in this case it would be the child. However you also have been very rash in how you addressed this issue; coming off more as commanding than conversing. You need to try to make your financial situation clear and the implications a reduced income would mean for your family. Not forcing her hand into staying at home because you think you\u2019re right.\n\nDraw up a spreadsheet and compare the financial freedom/stability you\u2019d have if you alone worked/ she alone worked/ you both worked. Perhaps a physical presentation will make it easier for her to understand where you\u2019re coming from and be more willing to compromise. Compile the total cost you are currently paying for your child\u2019s special care- then do so again with each of the benefits your health insurances provide for your child\u2019s specialised care. With that comparison add it to your entire monetary commitments and bills and see where you stand once that\u2019s all removed from her income. If her income cannot even cover all that then it\u2019s should be evident what needs to be done and it\u2019ll be up to you two to decide how much leftover income is enough to decide if you\u2019re out of the red. \n\nThese are mostly suggestions but in all honesty, your best outcome is you convincing her to accept a nanny so you can both be working. I understand that she wants to be more hands on with her child as a parent- but she also needs to understand that the health and comfort of the child are just as important- if not more. If you both work then you could save up enough to be able to take it easy a few years down; so you aren\u2019t completely absent from your child\u2019s childhood.", "NTA she has to be more realistic and accept that. There is no compromise. Good luck", "NTA and your wife needs to grow up and face reality. Sometimes what we envision for our future doesn\u2019t turn out the way we thought it would.

That is obviously important to her and I would feel the same way.  But.   It was naive of her to think your career wouldn't progress, and it is unreasonable to budge on other options.  If she wants to develop her career and still be able to provide for her kid, she needs to make some concessions.  A nanny maybe.  Or asking grandparents to come be a village.  \n\nYou also need to soften up a bit.  Talk to your job and find out what options you have.  Hybrid remote work for a few days a week?  Paternity leave?  Something.  Find out your options and work with her on this.  Rigidity is just going to build resentment in your marriage.   Maybe quitting your job is not an option but I'm sure there are other possible solutions that don't involve her taking a four to five year hit on her career development.\n\nSituations change and you have to adapt.

It sounds like you are \"telling\" her not sharing a discussion.  She didn't want to give up her career permanently.  She probably needs to relax a little on the childcare - a good nanny is just fine - so that she can work on her own happiness if thats is going to come from her working.  But the point is, its a mutual problem solving discussion where you equally share and compromise.  Its not you telling her that she's expected to stay home for another 2 years.  She has choices of her own to make that you are not in control of, such as what she chooses for her career.

There are too many variables missing. \n\nOpinion source: having a dependent family member with a chronic uncommon condition, very expensive and necessary meds, and great insurance. I think NAH also.

The plan is only valid if the person is an employee of that place of work. Once that person leaves it will eventually be terminated. \n\nThey have a son who has medical conditions that require specialized doctors. Doctors don\u2019t take every insurance. If he quits that job and the insurance plan her work place happens to not be accepted or cover specialists what happens then? The kid is going to have to shop around to find one that does take the insurance and that could push back needed medication getting filled putting him at risk.

This is a case of a child who ended up with special needs. Yes they made a plan based on her wants of not putting the kid into daycare or hiring a nanny. She was the one who made this rule not him. He agreed before learning their son has medical issues. The old plan is no longer viable option for the kid they do have.

That was my point - the wife says both of them working isn't feasible because she doesn't trust the daycares.\n\nSo why not just both work and hire a nanny instead???", "No he doesn\u2019t, finances change and agreements need to change with them", "Didn\u2019t mean to imply she didn\u2019t.

There was an unplanned complication in the form of significant medical expenses. \n\nBut yeah\u2026women losing momentum in their career happens very often. They have a complication that have made the previous plan impractical. There now needs to be a compromise. Either she agrees to stay home so they can afford to live and pay the medical expenses or they spend the next 6 months looking for a good place for the child to get care. But going into debt monthly or skimping on medical costs is impractical and doesn\u2019t seem to be possible to avoid if he loses his job.\n\nNot all childcare facilities are bad.

But he is claiming the only option is for her to remain the primary parent (with or without child care help.) That is simply not true.

Well, to start with, neither of them has any control whatsoever over what their respective employers are willing to do; just because hers agreed has no bearing at all on what his will agree to do.
