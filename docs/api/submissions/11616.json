The way he spoke about it in therapy is he had imagined us asking him for help if something broke, turning to him to learn how to drive, expecting my sister and I to want his opinion on guys and for my brother to seek out guy time with him as he got into that stage of life where \"a lot of teen boys seek guidance from the men closest to them\" and what he got was us being okay with him but not seeking him out and looking to male relatives on our dad's side for some of the things he mentioned (though it was my aunt who taught all three of us how to drive).\n\nI think Michael is fine but for me he has never really graduated past mom's husband in my heart. I care about him mostly because he makes my mom happy and is so good to her.\n\nI'm getting married in the summer. My fiance and I are having a smaller and more personal wedding. In many ways it will be a more sentimental wedding. I asked my uncle (dad's brother) to walk me down the aisle since my mom doesn't like doing that stuff.

I've met them a few times but I do not consider them family and they only made it onto the guest list because I didn't want any difficulty with Michael because he wasn't happy to learn he wasn't fulfilling any of the usual FOTB duties. But he was annoyed that I didn't want his family to play a role in the wedding. They're guests and nothing more.

That's life in a blended family.  My step kids don't see me as a father figure, I'm just their mums new husband.  I met their mum when the oldest was 16 and the youngest was 13.  I know they appreciate me - I got a fathers day card last year from the youngest (now 23 saying exactly that because I make their mum happy.\n\nMichael however is being a bit childish in his insistence, especially as he knows that's not the relationship the OP has with him and especially with his family.

And in return for that, the kid grows up to be the sort of person who talks about the guy like he's someone she met a week ago who inexplicably wants to be treated like he's been a part of her life.

He felt entitled for a important part at the wedding and he felt entitled to everything a father should have just because he got married for a mother with children. Having expectations is fine but he just assumed he would immediately gain everything he wanted without being their actual father.", "No one said to stop viewing their birth father, the OP is perfectly capable of acknowledging their birth father and acknowledging the contribution their step father has had in their life. Instead they constantly find little ways to reject him and yes, it can be cruel when it continues to happen now after more than a decade. \n\nTantrums, I didn't see any examples of tantrums. Maybe from the sisters but not from the step dad, he just expressed his desires and admitted his disappointment. Which is healthy and normal. Now if  he caused a scene or was trying to withdraw funds he had put forth for the wedding, that would be a tantrum. But to say you are disappointed that your step child doesn't have a place for you or any of your family in their wedding any more than they would for Bob their friend from work.  Yeah that's a reasonable thing to be disappointed over.", "That's why I'm wondering why people choose to be step-parents.

There is an irreplaceable bond with your own child and your responsibility to them is like nothing else. \n\nYes, you can have a great bond with a step child under the right circumstances and there are certainly a lot of responsibilities\u2014such as treating them well, respecting their boundaries as well as some day-to-day practical things.

So many step parents think that they'll just get the mom/dad title just by default, but it doesn't work that way. The fact that he's so pushy is probably just hurting his case more.

He would have been just as pleased if I only invited him. He wasn\u2019t expecting anything even though he had raised me for 21 years. He did have father of the bride duties and walked me down the aisle. But people like him are a thing of the past. He has now been in my life for 45 years in August. He looks out for me and I him. I call him multiple times a week to check on him because he\u2019s 79 and lives alone. My sister also calls him many times a week. One of us always goes to his Dr appointments. I am actually surprised we are allowed in because we tell on him when stuff aren\u2019t going good. He\u2019s grandpa and great grandpa as well (my grandkids get very excited to see him). It\u2019s too bad these kinds of people seem to be a thing of the past. A lot of stepdads couples learn a lot about being one from him.", "aahh missed that, thanks.", "They can be upset. I'd still say they aren't owed it. But honestly, I don't see that there is even a comparison. Step parents are not parents. The name should be changed, honestly. So how a parent feels, to me, is a completely different thing than an adult that chooses to marry and create this situation. If you choose to create this situation, you owe the kids, they owe you nothing.", "Wow, I don't quite understand this logic.\n\nI get that you can't force feelings. But it has always seemed unnatural to me in this sub that kindness is not returned when you have experienced kindness from someone.\n\nIf a stepparent doesn't fill the traditional role as parent in a child's life, don't they even rank the level of friend? Many people's friends do transform into family of sorts for them. \n\nSo here we have a good stepfather, by OP's account. Not a horrible person that makes mom choose between him and her kids or treats them poorly. Helps provide them a more stable life than what they might have had if mom had to go it alone. Treats mom well. Is hurt that he's not seen as some sort of positive male role model, and actually goes to therapy for it. The mere fact that he's hurting underscores his level of care and commitment to the family and it's too bad, so sad for him?\n\nWow.\n\nWhile I'm not saying his family deserves a place in OP's wedding, does Michael not count in any way or form for the years of love and care he wanted and tried to provide? Was he not even a trusted adult friend that OP and siblings could count on?\n\nIf that is the case, then nobody should ever marry someone with kids from a previous relationship. You wind up giving too much and receiving nothing in return. In other places on this sub, that would be considered abuse.  Warning received.", "What cruel treatment?  I never said that a step parent owes a step kid nothing. They certainly owe it to them to treat them well, respect their boundaries and reasonable help with some degree of practical things (rides to places, contribute to the household, etc.). That\u2019s not cruel. \n For example, step parents don\u2019t have to pay for step-kids college, leave them an inheritance share, pay for their weddings, etc. It is totally fair for them to say \u201ctalk to your parents.\u201d\n\nAlso it\u2019s totally unrealistic to say out of one side of your mouth that step kids owe step parents nothing while step parents owe the highest of his standards to their step kids. \n\nYou can\u2019t expect anyone in the real world to continue a complete and total one-way relationship. That\u2019s just not how relationships work. It can perhaps be more weighted toward the step parent particularly when the child is a minor, but suggesting 100% to 0% is just nonsense.", "Then don't marry people with kids. This is not hard. You absolutely can expect them to continue a one-way relationship. THEY CHOSE TO CREATE THIS SITUATION.

Your wedding, your rules and you can't force a bond. He's too pushy. He wanted the image of happy family not the actual love and work that comes with it.
