The way he spoke about it in therapy is he had imagined us asking him for help if something broke, turning to him to learn how to drive, expecting my sister and I to want his opinion on guys and for my brother to seek out guy time with him as he got into that stage of life where \"a lot of teen boys seek guidance from the men closest to them\" and what he got was us being okay with him but not seeking him out and looking to male relatives on our dad's side for some of the things he mentioned (though it was my aunt who taught all three of us how to drive).\n\nI think Michael is fine but for me he has never really graduated past mom's husband in my heart. I care about him mostly because he makes my mom happy and is so good to her.\n\nI'm getting married in the summer. My fiance and I are having a smaller and more personal wedding. In many ways it will be a more sentimental wedding. I asked my uncle (dad's brother) to walk me down the aisle since my mom doesn't like doing that stuff.

I've met them a few times but I do not consider them family and they only made it onto the guest list because I didn't want any difficulty with Michael because he wasn't happy to learn he wasn't fulfilling any of the usual FOTB duties. But he was annoyed that I didn't want his family to play a role in the wedding. They're guests and nothing more.

That's life in a blended family.  My step kids don't see me as a father figure, I'm just their mums new husband.  I met their mum when the oldest was 16 and the youngest was 13.  I know they appreciate me - I got a fathers day card last year from the youngest (now 23 saying exactly that because I make their mum happy.\n\nMichael however is being a bit childish in his insistence, especially as he knows that's not the relationship the OP has with him and especially with his family.

And in return for that, the kid grows up to be the sort of person who talks about the guy like he's someone she met a week ago who inexplicably wants to be treated like he's been a part of her life.

If he had told them it was the right move and he understood they wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to be blowing her up.", "See I'm not reading anywhere that the step family is upset at all. Only Michael is. I bet the step family doesn't care, doesn't want to give any speeches (what would they even say? They don't know OP) and is happy to just attend. Michael is using his family to guilt OP, and maybe as a bargaining chip, like she says no to extended family speeches but offers him a speech to get him to stop, which was all he really wanted in the first place.", "This!", "I feel like officiating would be a better use of Dolly\u2019s time and abilities", "By that definition, step-parent shouldn't be AH for not caring about their step-kids, because they are not parents right?\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering why people choose to be step-parents. You get the responsibility of a parent with no respect or authority of one.", "I wish I could upvote this several times.", "\"favored relatives are getting prominent roles in the wedding\" That part killed me. Like, yeah, obviously the family OP is close to are getting the spotlight? That's how weddings *work*. Especially when it seems OP has only met his family a few times.", "It also seems like mom gets no role in the wedding, which strikes me as weird in a single parent situation.", "He's not financing the wedding. Was not at extra curricular activities and didn't drive us to those places. Didn't support me through college. He and mom both worked but he was the primary breadwinner of the household back then. Not sure about now.", "He's not.", "He's not paying for the wedding.", "Came here to say just that! \n\nSince they aren\u2019t going to get the special treatment they are DEMANDING, uninvite them!\n\nYou only invited his family to appease him and since they are all unsatisfied with their status as guests at your wedding\u2026their presence is no longer needed. You would rather save money on the head count for the caterer.\n\nAlso angry people at weddings, get drunk, and do stupid things like get terrible speeches on purpose!\n\nNTA", "Might want to uninvite ALL of them. Including mom's husband if he keeps making everyone miserable.", "Inviting his (rude as hell) siblings are parents _is_ throwing him a bone. He's being an asshole about it, so the bone should be taken back.", "The step parent made the choice to become a step parent. The kids don\u2019t get that choice. They\u2019re not victims if the kids don\u2019t see them as a parent", "EXACTLY lol", "He seems more entitled if anything. He felt entitled for a important part at the wedding and he felt entitled to everything a father should have just because he got married for a mother with children. Having expectations is fine but he just assumed he would immediately gain everything he wanted without being their actual father.", "No one said to stop viewing their birth father, the OP is perfectly capable of acknowledging their birth father and acknowledging the contribution their step father has had in their life. Instead they constantly find little ways to reject him and yes, it can be cruel when it continues to happen now after more than a decade. \n\nTantrums, I didn't see any examples of tantrums. Maybe from the sisters but not from the step dad, he just expressed his desires and admitted his disappointment. Which is healthy and normal. Now if  he caused a scene or was trying to withdraw funds he had put forth for the wedding, that would be a tantrum. But to say you are disappointed that your step child doesn't have a place for you or any of your family in their wedding any more than they would for Bob their friend from work.  Yeah that's a reasonable thing to be disappointed over.", "That's why I'm wondering why people choose to be step-parents. But thankfully irl doesn't work like reddit and people don't just reduce step-parents to nothing.\n\nAgain like, no, step-parents are parents, as they are caretakers. They do deserve authority and respect just as teachers and even nannies do. Children don't have to love them, that's why I think OP is NTA, but I'm responding to that comment that 'step-parents aren't parents'.", "By this logic, then a parent with both step and bio kids should give preferential treatment to the bio kids, am I missing something?", "Just the opposite. The stepparent has an absolute obligation to treat all the kids equally. The stepchildren owe that person nothing. Not appreciation, certainly not love. Don't like it? Don't marry someone with kids.", "Total bullshit. \n\nA step parent is not a parent. It causes no end of trouble when people want to play make-believe otherwise. Reddit will happily and rightly point that out whenever a step parent expects to be treated as a parent. \n\nHowever it also tries to ignore the fact that by the same measure, a step child is not your child. There is an irreplaceable bond with your own child and your responsibility to them is like nothing else. \n\nYes, you can have a great bond with a step child under the right circumstances and there are certainly a lot of responsibilities\u2014such as treating them well, respecting their boundaries as well as some day-to-day practical things. But it\u2019s not your fucking kid.", "Then why on earth would you marry someone that had kids and Subject them to that treatment? It's cruel. Just don't marry someone with kids. If you do, and you treat them any differently than your own, you are a monster. The kids get no say in the matter and did nothing to deserve that."]}
