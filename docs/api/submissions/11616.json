I have a twin brother and an older sister. Mom met Michael when I was 9 and she married him when I was 11. Michael was disappointed very early in the marriage when he realized he wasn't gaining the title of dad when he married mom and that our relationship with him was not as close as he wanted it to be. The way he spoke about it in therapy is he had imagined us asking him for help if something broke, turning to him to learn how to drive, expecting my sister and I to want his opinion on guys and for my brother to seek out guy time with him as he got into that stage of life where \"a lot of teen boys seek guidance from the men closest to them\" and what he got was us being okay with him but not seeking him out and looking to male relatives on our dad's side for some of the things he mentioned (though it was my aunt who taught all three of us how to drive).\n\nI think Michael is fine but for me he has never really graduated past mom's husband in my heart. I care about him mostly because he makes my mom happy and is so good to her.\n\nI'm getting married in the summer. My fiance and I are having a smaller and more personal wedding. In many ways it will be a more sentimental wedding. I asked my uncle (dad's brother) to walk me down the aisle since my mom doesn't like doing that stuff. My grandparents are doing a spotlight dance with me in honor of dad since mom will only be dancing once everyone else is lol. And my aunt is going to deliver a toast/speech that my dad had prepared before he died, and she's going to add her own bit after. The only slight attention on mom will be when we give out gifts but Michael is getting something, as are my future ILs.\n\nMichael's family are people I am not close to, to say the least. I've met them a few times but I do not consider them family and they only made it onto the guest list because I didn't want any difficulty with Michael because he wasn't happy to learn he wasn't fulfilling any of the usual FOTB duties. But he was annoyed that I didn't want his family to play a role in the wedding. They're guests and nothing more. One of his siblings can officiate weddings but my fiance and I had someone else in mind. He wanted the others to give toasts and I said it wasn't needed but was a kind offer.\n\nHe told me his family are just as important as my dad's and he doesn't like how I'm treating them as though they are not family. Then he told me it would stick out that favored relatives are getting prominent roles in the wedding but nobody from his side was. I told him that would not be changing and I was sorry if that made him unhappy. He told me I was being rude and that I should be giving more seeing as he's one of the parents of the bride. I told him he is not a parent of the bride and I would not give them something to do just because they're related to him.\n\nHe is still insisting I am wrong and his sisters are apparently furious with me (according to a DM I got from one of them).

They hardly made it on the guest list in the first place. Michael has been in my life for 14 years now and I am aware that he has always wanted more out of this than I wanted. I am also aware that people will take notice of the fact his family are not doing anything while all of my dad's side are. Refusing has meant causing trouble with Michael, maybe even hurting his feelings, and it makes me question if I'm wrong not to throw another bone somewhere for him/them.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is understandable, that when he cared for you 10+ years, that he sees himself as a father figure for you but if these feeling aren't mutual... well tough luck.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re being awfully nice by even inviting them in the first place. It\u2019s your wedding and your stepdad trying to make it about him through his family is ridiculous. He expected to waltz right into your life and magically be your new dad and when that didn\u2019t happen, he consistently tried to push your boundaries on it. I\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s doing so again with your wedding.", "NTA- It's your wedding and clearly not the time or place to force an extended step family on you. \nThe fact that people you barely know are upset that they're not included as family is totally bizarre. \n\nThe wedding you have planned sounds lovely by the way. The dance and speech particularly!", "NTA they have a choice one as guests or don't come at all, tell stepdad if you continue to get nasty messages from his family they will find themselves uninvited.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, man. You could have Dolly fuckin Parton walk you down the aisle if you have the cash and if she\u2019s down for it if you wanted. You know why? Cuz it\u2019s YOUR wedding. I never understand people that try to make someone else\u2019s day about them. You invited his family, which i believe is more than enough.", "NTA - Your wedding, your choices simple as that. Your step-father shouldn't be pushy about himself, or his family taking central role in your wedding, it's not their place. They can do that for their own family weddings. You've found some wonderful ways to incorporate your fathers memory, which is beautiful. Hopefully he doesn't choose to bring that grumpy energy to the wedding day.", "NTA. I consider family by blood so this man would also be nothing to me other than my mothers husband. His family would be even less than that, they would be literally nothing to me.\n\nTell him straight up; you ain\u2019t my dad, you never will be my dad, so please stop trying. It isn\u2019t going to happen. He needs to be told outright otherwise he will just continue to inset himself into for life thinking he is your dad. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to feel the way you are, I would feel the exact same way", "Step parents need to learn that they are not parents.  Not unless the kid wants them to be.  Insisting on trying to fill a role that wasn't made for you is an unhealthy boundary violation and it just sets every one up for misery.  NTA, op.  You can't heal Michaels hurt and you shouldn't give in to his pressure.", "NTA and tell him that if he doesn\u2019t quit his yammering and moaning you\u2019ll be uninvite t first His family and then him.", "NTA\nIt is your wedding, not his. And you are not obligated to see him and his relatives as family.", "Info: is he financially contributing to the wedding?\n\nNTA for not involving his family more. They're strangers to you.\n\nI do wonder about his role though.   What level of involvement has he had? You didn't confide in him. Did he take you to extra curricular activities? Was he cheering on the side lines? Did he support you through college? Did he work so your mom could staying home with her 3 kids? Did he take off for your prom? Help plan birthday parties? I get that you think of him as your mom's husband and not your dad but if he played an important role in your life, I think he deserves bigger role at your wedding. It costs nothing to give him one special dance, and ask people to join in midway.", "I know I'm gonna be downvoted, but ESH. \n\nYeah, you are in your rights to have your wedding the way you want it. And Michael does have to accept it.\n\nHere's where you become an AH. Michael has tried his hardest to be a father to you and your siblings. Going to therapy to understand you all better, treating your mom right, probably helped you all financially, and a lot of other stuff too, I'm sure. He never tried to be a complete replacement for your dad, but he did want to do fatherly things. And you treat and talk about him as if he's a piece of dirt your mom just picked up yesterday. He did not deserve the coldness you all gave him. He really tried. You are an AH for your constant treatment of him. The man has been experiencing years of hurt by you and your siblings and has pretty much silently taken it.", "NTA your wedding your rules. That being said, would it be so bad to make a few concessions? I\u2019m sure over the years he made financial contributions to your upbringing. I\u2019m sure he was there for you mother as she was raising three kids, financially and emotionally. I\u2019m sure he enhanced your life in ways you never considered. You\u2019re fortunate you had your dad\u2019s family in your life but your stepdad was there waiting in the wings just in case.", "Is he contributing to the wedding financially?", "Soft YTA I know this is going to be downvoted to hell but such is life.\n\n\n Family isn't just blood relatives, this man has been in your life for more than a decade, and went to therapy to help you understand how he feels while accepting your honestly kind of cruel constant rejection. \n\n\nIt is your wedding and you have the right to do whatever the heck you want with it, but just like every bridezilla post out there just because you have the right doesn't mean that the way you deliberately went about snubbing him in any way you could have chosen to involve him. The rest of his family can kick rocks, but honestly I think they are more upset at the way you are treating him than that they themselves aren't involved.\n\n\nI get that you don't \"feel\" that way about him but he has been there for you and accepted you for a long time, and you aren't pointing to him being overly assertive or insistent trying to make you call him dad or getting rid of your dad's things, which then would make you more than justified to exclude him. Even if you don't \"feel\" that way you could have found some way to involve him. The fact that you didn't was deliberate and hurtful at every point you picked someone else, yeah you're being kind of a jerk at this point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't have to love him and you don't have to see him as a Dad, but he's probably been financially supporting you and probably supporting you in other things, and the way you describe him is like he walked in to your life yesterday. It sounds like you actually don't care about him at all. You're NTA for this decision but you're definately the AH in general.", "Yeah no the OP doesn't suck at all.  She doesn't consider Michael a father figure.  Sure Michael has tried his best but his step kids aren't interested in Michael being a replacement father to their bio-dad.  And there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nFrom the post it doesn't seem like the OP or her siblings aren't being disrespectful to Michael and they appreciate the joy that he brings to their mum so there.  That's life in a blended family.  My step kids don't see me as a father figure, I'm just their mums new husband.  I met their mum when the oldest was 16 and the youngest was 13.  I know they appreciate me - I got a fathers day card last year from the youngest (now 23 saying exactly that because I make their mum happy.\n\nMichael however is being a bit childish in his insistence, especially as he knows that's not the relationship the OP has with him and especially with his family.  Michael needs to learn to respect the OP's feelings.", "Yeah. Everyone has a right to plan their wedding how they want.\n\nThat said, if someone was there day in and day out for half of your childhood sincerely doing their best to do right by the kids... they deserve a little more consideration than the sheer dismissiveness of the OP.\n\nIt's probably kind of a low blow to say it, but I can't help thinking \"Is this something OP's dad would be proud of?\" No parent wants their kids to grow up without them, but any decent parent who didn't have a choice in the matter would be extraordinarily grateful to know someone stepped up and did everything possible to meet their needs, even knowing that there was no way he could ever replace their dad. And in return for that, the kid grows up to be the sort of person who talks about the guy like he's someone she met a week ago who inexplicably wants to be treated like he's been a part of her life. Is that the kind of person anyone dreams their kids'll grow up to be?\n\nIt's definitely sad to think about.", "This man seems to have gone above and beyond for these kids. I grew up with a stepdad who was clear that I was nothing but a \u201cluggage\u201d my mother brought into the marriage. OP has no idea how lucky she is to have such an awesome stepfather.", "I get what you're saying. My judgement and everything else still stands, but I do see your viewpoints and they do make sense.
