Nah man. You can and should invite people that actually want to celebrate with you. If I was you, I would exclude him from future events; see if his work wants to invite him to its engagement/wedding/baby shower instead. \n\nYour job is not to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d (that\u2019s what enablers of bad behavior say): your job is to enjoy your life with people who love you.

Graduation is no exception, he put his job before you.", "NTA\n\nYour dad declined his invite. He doesn't get to decide who goes in his place.

But seems you handled this right. First invited dad. When he declined invited people you'd like there that helped support you. Still having mom. Good choice.

The reason to go is to celebrate the accomplishment of the person walking.\n\nCongratulations on this success, and know you are clear on this one.", "NTA. Family is relationships, not blood. It\u2019s your event and you have the right to invite the people that you want to celebrate with. Also i seriously cringe anytime I hear, \u201cjust do X to keep the peace\u201d.

It\u2019s rewarding someone for being unreasonable and only furthers that behavior.", "NTA\n\nFrom what you say your dad is always absent for important events of your life. Once he chose not to attend your graduation it is up to you who you decide to call. He or your mom cannot dictate who you invite. You\u2019re right in your decision to invite people you consider close\u2026 As to the comment on \u201ctemporary\u201d relations I\u2019d say, you never know which people are going to stay in your life and for how long. So, just enjoy the moments now.", "NTA. Sounds like your dad wants to be only a temporary dad.", "NTA. You did right. You invited people that care about you. Don't let anyone tell you different.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad wants to have his cake and eat it too. He declined the invitation. He consistently prioritises his work and his personal comfort over his daughter's milestones. He has no right to dictate who you invite in his place. There's only one person acting like a \"spoiled brat\", and it's certainly not you.\n\nYour mom isn't helping the situation either. Keeping the peace is overrated. I do wonder, you say your boyfriend's family attends all your events and takes you on vacation - what is your mom doing when all this is happening? Do you live with her?\n\nYour boyfriend and his family are absolutely wonderful for you. Meanwhile your dad is neglectful and I don't know about your mom.\n\nYou are 100% right that you should be around people you're comfortable with.

You chose people who were actually there for you and wanted to come. \n\nBut I would think about how you\u2019ll feel about it if 6 months from now, you and your boyfriend break up.

If the answer is yes, then go ahead.", "NTA!!! \n\nIt's YOUR special achievement day (congrats on your success after all your hard word, by the way!) and you should have the people there that you want, that you feel love you and support you. You're not OBLIGATED to invite your uncle and his family to keep the peace.   \n\n\nThe fact that he, your dad himself, said he wouldn't go because he'd rather stay in his own city and work, doesn't get to then choose who you have to attend your graduation.

It\u2019s supposed to be a free country and you\u2019re free to invite who you like.", "Ooh, what a lovely shiny spine you have and not afraid to straighten it either.\n\nBravo you. It took some courage to stick up for yourself, especially to your father, who, it seems to me, is not a very nice person at all. \n\nNTA at all and you are 'keeping the peace'. You're keeping your own peace by inviting people you care about and who care about you. \n\nHave a great day and don't bother inviting your father to any more important events.
