It\u2019s about an hour flight.\n\nAs we were boarding we saw right in front of us was a family with an infant. Literally in a car seat. I said maybe a bit too loudly to my girlfriend \u201cOf course we get the seats near the baby, this is going to be hell.\u201d The dad obviously heard me and said something like \u201cDon\u2019t worry she usually is only upset for a few minutes after take off but it shouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d\n\nSo we sit down and to his credit the baby was being pretty quiet though it did keep staring at me between the seats which I didn\u2019t love.\n\nWe take off and the baby starts whining. I rolled my eyes at my girlfriend and she gave me a look. Then I noticed through the seat the mom was holding her phone up to the baby and yes the baby\u2019s stopped whining but a few minutes later I realised the mom was just letting the sound play from her phone. The baby wasn\u2019t wearing headphones. As much as I didn\u2019t sign up to hear a crying baby I also didn\u2019t sign up to hear kids shows.\n\nI tapped the dad on the shoulder and told him it was rude to be playing videos on speaker phone. He told the mom and she turned it off. Sure enough then the baby started up again. Luckily it went to sleep for the rest of the flight shortly after and I thought we were in the clear. However when we landed it was standing up in its seat and looking over the back of the seat at me and my girlfriend and just in general being distracting. I made another comment that if passengers couldn\u2019t stay in their seats until it was their turn to deplane they probably were too young to travel. \n\nAt this point the dad rolled his eyes at me. I was upset because we weren\u2019t being disruptive, they were and it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to be uncomfortable because they decided to bring their kid on a plane. Frankly I\u2019ve previously been on flights where parents gave out gift bags to people for putting up with their kids. This guy rolling his eyes at me was extra rude and it seemed like he felt entitled to be disruptive.\n\nWhen we got our bags my girlfriends mom picked us up and asked about the flight so I detailed it was bad because of the above. My girlfriend cut me off and said I was being an asshole. Her mom seemed to agree with her and her dad and brother were awkwardly quiet when we got home and I asked their opinion on it. In any other case someone playing YouTube from their phone on speaker and dancing around in their chair and being loud would be seen as rude right?

I am not a fan of being near babies when traveling, but I am still sympathetic to the parents. Children exist. That\u2019s how we keep the machine going.

In your whole post, you were the one making me anxious, not your details about *gasp* a baby staring at you!", "YTA This is a joke, right?  The flight was an hour and this behavior seems fine by both the parents and the baby.   It seems like you were mad that the baby dared to be near you and were looking for something to be mad about.

It\u2019s not that big of a deal. \n- Parents can\u2019t do anything about fussing babies.

I think this tops your YTA position, it\u2019s a CHILD.\n\nOverall, it seems you\u2019re a very irritable person and a good moment of self-reflection would be your solution  to all of this.", ">So we sit down and to his credit the baby was being pretty quiet though it did keep staring at me between the seats which I didn\u2019t love.\n\nThis cannot be real.

The judgement is about calling out inconsiderate parents. \n\nPlaying videos out loud in an enclosed space? The parents were completely inconsiderate!!! \n\nNTA. No headphones, no volume. Baby can\u2019t wear headphones? Then baby doesn\u2019t get a video. \n\nI\u2019d rather be stuck listening to a baby cry for an entire plane ride than be forced to listen to a video out loud in terrible phone quality crackly speakers. The sound effects alone from those videos/games drive me crazy. Ever been on a public bus where the parents shove an iPad in their kid\u2019s face and let them run wild? \n\nBabies can\u2019t help crying, but parents can help the volume. Absolutely they were inconsiderate. \n\nNTA", "YTA. YTA. YTA. \nyou are the reason I had panic attacks before I flew with my kid when he was really small.

I grew up in Hawaii and my extended family was in Montana\u2026 did I not deserve to see my grand parents until I was 10 just because I may cry on the airplane because I\u2026 wait for it\u2026 was a baby!?\n\nIf you choose to have kids I hope you remember this. You have no idea how unnerving it is to be a parent of a small child on a plane knowing there are assholes like you all around.", "YTA - You were pissed off at being near a baby before you even knew their temperament, and then you were just an AH for the sake of it.

I'm embarrassed for you in front of your girlfriend's family.", "YTA it sounds like you were obsessed with getting this baby to piss you off from the get-go so you\u2019d have reasons to be angry. Maybe that is how you deal with stress in general. The baby looking at you too much is a ridiculous complaint especially. Don\u2019t look at the baby then! And the flight was 1 hour!

It's perfectly safe (this is almost universally agreed amongst pediatricians - they won't say it publicly on the record, so make sure to discuss it privately during an appointment) and it makes travelling with children SO much easier and less stressful for the parent.

I am 100% certain your gf is looking at you and the relationship differently now.

But that wasn't good enough for you because baby wasn't wearing earphones.  Have you ever seen a baby wear earphones comfortably?  \n\nThen baby was standing on the seat.  Well, babies do that because they're too small to stand on the ground and see what's going on.  The parents were getting ready to deplane just as I'm sure you and all the other passengers were.  Unless you were all sitting politely waiting for the cabin crew to instruct your row to leave?  Of course not, everyone jumps up and tries to be the first off the plane.

They scream, they cry, they laugh, they're unpredictable. Sounds like the parents did all they could and things could have been a lot worse. If you noticed the child starting at you then you must have been looking back at him/her yourself... You're an adult look away!\n\nMost of all, remember you were a baby once too. Whilst you may now be physically older, it seems you have a lot of maturing to do.", "YTA.  Too bad for you that the baby lacked the social skills you expected.

Maybe next time you fly, you'll have your big boy pants on and everyone can marvel at your social progress.", "YTA. Yeah having a baby on the plane is annoying but you need to suck it up. It is hard enough for parents as it is.", "YTA... The parents should have definitely known better and not have done what they did. However, it was not your place to speak up in that scenario. You could have listened to a podcast on headphones instead of complaining. Plus, kids are going to stare and fidget and there isn't really much the parents can do about that so getting pissed that a small child looked at you was pretty shitty. On top of that, many airlines have rules about phones being on speaker so a flight attendant probably would have said something to them. Plus, in your post, it seems like the entire time you were focused on yourself and what is good for you. Yes, the parents were being annoying and shouldn't have put the phone on speaker, but the fact that as soon as you say down you expressed verbally that you were against the small child being on the flight was crappy.\n\nEdit: changed from ESH to YTA after several reasonable points in responses", "YTA. \n\nDidn't have to read any further than this.\n\n> I said maybe a bit too loudly to my girlfriend \u201cOf course we get the seats near the baby, this is going to be hell.\u201d", "YTA for all the reasons that people have already mentioned here\n\nIf just an hour of discomfort can shake you that much, I can\u2019t imagine how if is feasible for you to be okay with this truly twisted world", "YTA.

I have sensory issues. \nAlso babies cry during ascending and descending because of the pressure on their ears. Their ears are not used to this yet and it hurts them. So not a good place for them. I\u2019d pay extra for a child free flight tbh. \n\nBUT, in this case.. you sound like an absolute asshole.

I bring two pairs of headphones on flights just in case of this exact scenario since one pair is better at noise cancelling than the other one, and sometimes I\u2019d rather have over the ears headphones in than earbuds.

You\u2019ll be fine, and quite frankly if being in the presence of a baby for an hour and listening to a baby video for a few minutes is your idea of a real problem you should stop whining and be grateful for having an incredibly privileged life, because that is not a real problem, it\u2019s not even an inconvenience really.
