He got upset over not having control over something that happened in his home. He didn't like that you didn't give him a chance to supervise your decision making.\n\n Is he usually this anxious about having control over everything? Does he trust people to do work that he could've done? Very distrustful people tend to have control issues. \n\nYou could perhaps speak to him about this from the angle of trust.

You needed a new one. \n\nSome extra context would be nice though, lol, because now I feel invested in why a mop is so triggering for him. \n- Is he generally controlling about finances? This is a big one because financial control and isolation is often the first step towards spousal abuse. Start noting these interactions altercations in a diary, you can write about everything else too, but it just makes it easier to go back and objectively look at how much it has happened and whether or not it is progressing and/or evolving, and then to later determine if you need to leave, if it\u2019s addressable, or if it\u2019s just a quirk. Just make sure not to use certain keywords (like \u201cabuse\u201d) in said diary, in case he reads it. Just a normal: \u201cWe had an argument today, this is how I feel about it.\u201d \n- Does he consult you when he makes purchases for work he completes, and just feels like you aren\u2019t on the same page? Maybe he needs to understand that you both need a bit more freedom and empowerment when it comes to stuff like that, because there does sometimes need to be a more efficient way of accomplishing regular and reasonable purchases or upgrades. Consulting each other about such minute shit, especially when it is something only one of you uses, is an utter waste of time, and just breeds an u healthy amount of dependence on each other for routine, daily decision making. \n- does he have a previous relationship or spouse that was impulsive and frivolous with spending and he\u2019s projecting that fear onto you. This one sucks, because while he\u2019s still objectively wrong getting so upset about a mop\u2026 he is the person you chose, and this is the baggage he came with\u2026 you may have to make some concessions if you want to help him keep his anxiety level low, and not push him too far out of his comfort zone. Maybe have some discussion about how you will respect some boundaries, but that they need to be just a little bit more reasonable. \n- Is there something else you are hiding from him, or that he might think you are hiding from him? Something financial maybe? If so, you need to address it ASAP, because he does know or thinks he knows, and this isn\u2019t about a mop, but he doesn\u2019t know how to confront it.", "NTA and incredibly blatant red flag alert!", "Does he control the finances?

You are clearly NTA, but is there something going on financially he\u2019s hiding from you?", "NTA, of course, but there must be a reason for his outburst. Did he have a sentimental attachment to the old mop? Did it remind him (perhaps if he dressed the fronds in a specific way) of a late relative, or a former lover? Or maybe it stood in for a friend, a bit like \"Wilson\" from Castaway, and he used to talk to it/ do air guitar/ mop karaoke when nobody was looking?
