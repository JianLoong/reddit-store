There was so many options and you defaulted to being mean because you\u2019ve presumed her intentions and actions. \n\nIf you don\u2019t wanna do the shift, don\u2019t do the shift. Ever. If you have an issue with her work ethic, go to management. Always. What we don\u2019t do as grown adults is to refuse to communicate effectively in the workplace and be passive aggressive to coworkers\n\nEdit, because my memory is balls: the more you cover her shifts also, the more management is gonna consider it not a big deal.

Like, just give up that shift ffs. So annoying.", "NTA But she is, and so are your boss's. Someone, apart from you, should have noted this pattern before this and dealt with it", "NTA.  About time someone called her out on her nonsense.  Make it very clear to her you will no longer cover for her any day, because she\u2019s run out of kindness from you.", "NTA.  \nWith one place I worked for, it is up to the person needing the leave to organise for someone to take over. If you're really sick, you need a cert. Thats when I was recovering overseas.  \nAnd I've experienced what you had as well, except with that mob. I was made to be the bad guy if I called it out. Eventually I just don't care and let the manager allowing it to happen to cop it from the business. I literally once had two guys on hold because the other guy wasn't there and the only other guy that was there was busy brown nosing said boss.  \nBy that stage, I was already sick of it and looking around and I suggest you do too if you can. Obviously your boss don't care (and I wonder why).", "NTA - She needed to hear it.  Hopefully it makes a difference, but I doubt it.  She'll be talking to you again as soon as she needs someone to cover for her.", "NTA. I have a coworker like that and she's not even a single mom, just a mom. She simply does not want to work and doesn't care about anyone else.", "NTA", "NAH NTA - she SHOULD  \"grow the eff up\".  But this is an HR problem now -  or should be.

The firm would have to replace her .", "NTA - However you did go about it in kind of a gruff way that might have consequences for you, depending on the job. So you were kind of an AH to yourself. You should have just marked on the calendar days she was gone, then discussed it with a boss so they know she's shirking her duties. \n\nIt's your companies problem, not yours, and they're making it yours. I would do a lot for my coworkers, hell I'd sit on a jobsite for 3 months for one of them if they were laid up/injured or had a personal issue arise. But the thing is, they don't abuse that. They earned that right, they use it sparingly, and I respect and like them for that. \n\nShe is not one of those people.

While what she is doing is not okay, swearing at a coworker is not acceptable behavior. You should have taken this up the ladder.", "Sounds like the AH here is an employer that makes you cover your own work when you are out sick. It should be your company's problem finding someone, and generally having enough staff when they need it. If someone keeps taking time off, they should be the ones who are upset with her, not you, and if they don't have enough people, they can hire more.", "NTA - you are part of a team and she isn't carrying her weight.

I'm pretty certain you are correct and well within your rights to call her out.", "NTA\n\nI have a job now where I work by myself, honestly the best job I have ever had because every time something went wrong in my old work places it was due to laziness, stupidity, and incompetence of colleagues. Don't get me wrong, the good people made it fun but people like who OP mentioned just drained my enthusiasm. I would even go as far as refuse to cover going forward, I don't want to see someone lose their job, especially a single mother but she is just taking it too far.", "NTA.\n\nI met people like her before.. they make any excuse in the world to miss work, they will blame their kid, car broke down 4 times a month, Grandma died for the 6th time.\n\nIt's the product of too many participation trophies.\n\nSome people legit will screw everyone else over, so they can sleep in and lose out on hundreds of dollars not showing up to work.\n\nI would watch it though you don't want her going to HR and calling it \"harassment\".", "NTA and also if she is \"out sick\" all the time shouldn't your supervisor have noticed by now?

You struck a nerve  and made her squirm. Good for you !", "NTA. We hired someone who ended up calling out almost every Monday. It took a little while for us to note it was EVERY monday, but once we did there was a talk with the boss about how we hired that person specifically for M-F and if they couldn't work M-F, then they needed to find a different job. They said they'd be fine. Called out one last Monday and was fired the next day. \n\nLean staffing is the real A, if your office can't handle one person being out without doubling everyone else's workload, then you have a bigger staffing issue. \n\nStop covering her on Mondays. Don't do her work. \n\nEveryone does deserve a break and if she can't figure out how to get that on the weekend or on her scheduled days off, then she needs to re-think what she does (Maybe move an errand to after work one day a week instead of on the weekend, don't put the kid in every sport available, block out time to just chill, etc). But none of this is your problem. It's hers to solve.", "NTA it\u2019s clear that she feels like she\u2019s entitled to you covering for her", "NTA.\n\nBut the issue you have is with management. They need to be aware that you are not an efficient worker when you work two jobs.", "NTA \n\nI'd be concerned about her ability to parent if she's getting so messed up over the weekend, she can't work on a Monday.", "What is your attendance policy? Is her supervisor following up?", "NTA. i have coworkers like this and they get on everyones nerves and ruin other people's day plans. they do need to grow up. either find another place to work, dont work the day they keep calling off, or actually work them.", "NTA.\n\nWeekends are her breaks. Outside of that she can book annual leave and schedule her time off.", "I know I'm going to get downvoted for this, but getting a break doesn't necessarily mean drinking. Just because you're a single mom who needs a break doesn't mean you need to use that break to incapacitate yourself so badly that you can't come to work on Mondays. \n\nClearly she has someone to watch her kids on the weekends. She could take that time to go to a movie, get a pizza and play board games with friends, Netflix and chill with a beau, etc. It doesn't have to be alcohol and drugs.\n\nThis isn't a single mom issue. This is the fact that she's got an alcohol/drug problem.", "NTA...you said what needed to be said. She's salty because the truth hurts!", "NTA! she is a mother, guess what, she should be putting her son first. a break is maybe one day a month. not every weekend.", "NtAH - you told her the truth and if the truth hurts, that is on her to fix.  I would not do her work anymore - allow her to do it Tuesday (if firing her is out of the question).  She needs to learn to come in on Mondays.  Drinking and drugs are not a reason for missing work.  I cannot imagine what else she decides not to do like care for her young son.  She needs some reality because most places fires you with that kind of behavior.", "NTA.\n\nWe have an absolute gobshite in our office who often takes dependent leave with some bullshit excuse about her kids, and it always seems to happen when the weather is good. \n\nSounds like your coworker is salty that she's been caught out and called out.", "NTA\n\nHer breaks are on the weekend, not on Mondays.

LoL. It's awful. I know it's not 100% her fault that when one person is out another person suffers for it, but at the same time she is definitely milking the system and it's frustrating.", "OP said that she\u2019s out getting drunk every weekend and calling off Mondays.

I'd be inclined to ask for the policy but that's another issue I guess. Management is absolutely failing you all, though. This is how team members burn out or wind up looking for other jobs.

There is probably a similar policy in place that isn\u2019t being enforced. Or there is no such policy and there should be one.
