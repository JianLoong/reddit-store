When we are out for any reason, we have to get coverage for our portion of the work. Obviously this puts a massive strain on us and doubles our workload for that day. I don't mind covering people who are sick or on vacation, but one of my coworkers, Liz, is really pushing it. \n\nLiz (F25) is a single mom and I do mostly like her as a person. But she calls out ALL THE TIME. Almost every Monday (our busiest day by far) I'll get a text saying that she or her son is sick and she can't come in and she asks me to cover for her. Again, normally I wouldn't think much of it, but it's starting to be almost every single Monday. And the real cherry on top is that every single weekend she is posting all over social media about how much she has been drinking or how drunk/high she is. So I would bet my left sock that she is not really sick on Mondays; just hungover. \n\nI am getting a little sick of covering every Monday because it puts me behind in my own work for the entire week because I am doing the workload of two people. So I've started ignoring her texts asking for help and she mostly figures it out. \n\nLast week we were really short staffed and I ended up having to cover for her anyway because there was no one else. So when she came in the next day I was a little salty and we didn't talk much. She was talking about her weekend and then when I was only giving one word answers, she asked what was wrong. I said that I was just trying to get caught up because I was really behind from being busy Monday. She made some little quip about how bad Mondays were and I kind of snapped and said \"How would you know, you never work Mondays anymore?\" \n\nShe got mad and said that she had been sick. I told her it was pretty convenient that she was sick every single Monday after being out all weekend running the town. She told me I was a complete asshole and how dare I judge her and that she was a single mom she deserved a break. I told her she was taking her breaks at everyone's expense and she needed to grow the f*** up. \n\nShe isn't talking to anyone now and I feel like I pushed it too far.", "created_utc": 1687263703, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e9ogy/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_grow_up/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
