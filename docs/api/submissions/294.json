Like you, I would not have appreciated a third party inviting themselves into my personal dialogue. But, unlike you, I don't expect my husband to deal with my problems while he's working.

How you handle mistakes is much more important than never making any.\n\nI hope part of your healing involves forgiving yourself for big reactions to stress. You have a brain that gets overstimulated easily, most people don't experience that.", "YTA - Have you considered that what might have happened is that you're just hella loud? When my SIL calls my husband I can clearly hear her side  of the conversation even when my husband is 5 feet away and the phone is to his ear.", "YTA. You messed up, you apologized, don't beat yourself up over it.", "Wait, so you just call him while he's at work often? A text heads up may prevent this in the future.... \n\nAnd honestly, if you both continue to contact one another during work hours or so (I'm presuming this wasn't during a break) it may end up in one or both of you actually being let go.", "YTA but you apologised, you've made up so don't worry about it and move on.
