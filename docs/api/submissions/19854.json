So, a few weeks ago, I planned to come to Savannah for vacation. I wanted my (43 male) BF to come with me. \n\nHe said he had a meeting he couldn't miss  so I put off the vacation for a day. He said he would be by to pick me up by 12. It comes and goes. 1pm; nothing 2pm; nothing. Now I'm pissed because I paid for three nights and I'll be damned if I waste a night due to his poor planning.. 3pm.\n\nHe finally called angrily, and ask where I am. I tell him I'm halfway to my destination. He demands I come back so we can ride together. I say no. He insisted. I still said no. He gets angry and tells me if I don't come back to ride with him, we are over. I tell him he is wasting his weekend and it's not that big a deal. Just meet me there. \n\nThe destination is three hours away from where I live. Not even out of state. He says he will come but that he's breaking up with me. I don't think this is a break up worthy event. But I say okay..\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for leaving to get to my destination on time, leaving my boyfriend to catch up? Or should I have waited?\n\nEdit: check in is at 4pm it is now 7:30 pm and he's still not here. I got here at 5pm.", "created_utc": 1686957431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bayd0/aita_for_leaving_to_go_on_my_own_vacation/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Think I may be the asshole because I knew he was in a meeting but at the same time I offered a solution that would save us both time. I offered to just go with him to his meeting and jump strainer on the road.

You mention in the comments that he is always late, maybe now he will see that you are serious when you say you want to leave by a certain time.  If he wants to break up with you because you are tired of him being inconsiderate, so be it.  \n\nYou should mention in the post that he has a history of being late.", "Enjoy your vacation.  This sounds like one of many red flags, but you hit your limit. When you get back, you can deal with his shenanigans,  but for bow, block him and have fun. NTA", "Did he notify you that he'd be late? A text or anything? \n\nIs this a pattern with him?\n\nAND last but not least, would he accept this behavior from you?\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nTell him not to bother to show up, you're breaking up with him.", "He\u2019s showing up to enjoy the vacation and then breaking up with you? Fuck that, enjoy the vacation alone, he can consider himself broken up with already, he doesn\u2019t need to come to you. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA because I\u2019m assuming you let him know weeks in advance that you planned this vacation. He\u2019s late to pick you up and then he\u2019s mad that you left? If he\u2019s going to be late picking you up on the day of the vacation then he should expect to travel alone.", "NTA.\n\nand i disagree, this IS a break up worthy event.\n\nwhy?\n\nhis total disregard for your time. you said it in the comments yourself that he is constantly late for things you plan but god forbid you are late when he plans the outing. \n\nwhy do you accept his mindset that his time is worthier than your time? that it is allright leaving you waiting for hours without any communication but him waiting for you he blows (assuming here) a gasket?\n\n* you already moved your vacation for one day to accomodate him.\n* you also offered a compromise to reduce travel time - and got shot down.\n* pick up time arrives but not your bf.\n* not a text, call, sms from him why he is a now show.\n* you tried to communicate with him - unsuccessfully.\n* you get fed up and leave after texting him that you left.\n* an hour later he finally calls you and demands that you drive back home so that you both can travel together - how the eff this should make sense other than him asserting dominance over you eludes me.\n* his demand your no. him doublling down you say no again. \n* him threatening break up.\n\nthis does **not** sound like a healthy / equal relationship.\n\ni so would not be surprised that he will not show up at your vacation destination, either. that when you return home he changed the locks and your belongings are either in garbage bags on the porch or thrown out / donated to goodwill / burnt.", "Nta but break this is about control", "NTA, your bf sounds like he's not worth the hassle, especially if he's saying you guys are over, when he's an AH and didn't bother letting you know he'd be several hours late. Enjoy your vacation and if he does show up, don't let him in, he doesn't deserve the vacation at this point tbh. Ultimatums are for people who feel like they need to be in charge of everything, but aren't. If he's giving you an ultimatum due to his own lateness & he himself being inconsiderate, what's he going to give you an ultimatum over next?", "You did not follow his script. He was enjoying the power trip of leaving you hanging, and then you wrecked his fun by acting like you are a person worthy of respect.\n\nYou have probably really ruined his afternoon.\n\nBut not to worry, you can fix this. He will have another script where he threatens you with a break up.  (Check), and you have to grovel and beg him not to leave you. Then he will have a power trip again and everything will be okay.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow this new script, (suppresses gighles) who knows what might happen. Probably the world will end.\n\nGood luck. There is a better guy out there for this manipulative little muppet.", "INFO: Does he have a history of being late like this and not informing you?", "NTA. Something is \"up\" with your BF.  If he is a grownup, he can drive find his own transportation down there on his own. He seems controlling and unreasonable.", "NTA.  Screw him.  \n\nTry out a place called spanky\u2019s on the river while you\u2019re there.  Get the calamari.  You\u2019re welcome.", "NTA. He sounds selfish without regard for your time (seeing comments this is his MO). Enjoy your trip. He also sounds immature threatening to break up. Maybe you are dodging a bullet.", "NTA - Break up with him first, and tell him he's not welcome to stay with you.  Just read all your comments - he does not value you or your time.", "INFO: Did you try to check in with him before you left? Also, what time did you leave? You mention you waited until 3pm, but then said it\u2019s a 3-hour drive and you got there at 5pm.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy your vacation.  Savanah is amazing!!", "He'll come but he's breaking up with you? What? Let me ruin your vacation before I bail on you? What even is that? \n\nNTA but this dude sure is.", "INFO: did you text or call him to ask what was happening? Did you text him when you decided to leave without him? And does he have a history of being late or unreliable?", "\u201cHe says he will come but that he is breaking up with me.\u201d\n\nHAHAHAHA.\n\nESH but this reads one of two ways:\n\n- a last straw moment and this relationship is clearly over\n- you both live for the drama.\n\nIf the first, break up with him before he gets there and enjoy the vacation yourself.\n\nIf the second, enjoy the wild make-up sex but ask yourself if the drama is really that fun. You\u2019re here asking, after all.", "??? if youre breaking up why would he still go", "Maybe this is something he wanted to do for a while and has finally found a reason he considers valid? NTA, he could have texted and said \u2018hey just so you know I\u2019m held up with work I\u2019ll be there in 2 hours\u2019 or something or when you rescheduled he could have said may not be able to go this weekend just do you know", ">He gets angry and tells me if I don't come back to ride with him, we are over\n\nI'm sorry, what???? This is such an overreaction to you not being home. Yes he is habitually late but this is very controlling behaviour. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\nTo threaten to break up just because you left early so controlling and will only get worse. Life is too short to be with someone who will react like this and throw tantrums like a child over such a minor issue! Like there are 8 billion people in the world and you can do so much better than this guy. Do 34 year old you a favour and dump him. Ennjiy yoir holiday and if he calls you back, just say I thought you broke up with? If he stutters just ask him why he would say that if he wasnt serious etc then break up with him", "BTA: So this seems like a huge miscommunication that could have been easily resolved. He should have been up front with his timing and communicated that he was going to be late and you should have been upfront with your expectations and communicated that you were leaving with out him. This is not a break up event in and off itself but the communication issues probably are.", "ESH\n\nHe's an AH for not updating you on when he'd be there. He should have said he was running late. \n\nYou're an AH for leaving. You just left. What if the reason he was late was that he was in an accident? How'd you feel if you get that call while you're at the destination. \n\nIt is a break up worthy event. You two clearly don't belong together.", "this is a break up event because the two of you don't communicate at all. \n\nHe didn't tell you he was going to be late, you didnt' tell him you were leaving...or care why he was late.\n\nESH", "Yikes. Best to let the relationship go away because that is not the behavior of two people who care about each other.\n\nESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that he didn\u2019t call until an hour after you left is irrelevant, because you couldn\u2019t have known that at the time you left.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m going ESH here.
