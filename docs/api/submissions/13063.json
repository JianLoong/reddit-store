I am currently on dialysis, and I'm in the ER/hospital at least every two weeks for many problems related to this disease. At the time this happened, I'd been hospitalized for about 3 days.\n\nSo, it happened like this: they took some blood to test my potassium level. (As a dialysis patient you can't get rid of any electrolytes on your own, you have to have dialysis. Potassium is a very dangerous one when there's too much, you can have a heart attack.) It came back high but I couldn't get dialysis right then because my catheter wasn't working. So in comes the director of surgery, and he says \"I'm doing this surgery right now. You can't have any Sedation of any type.\" So I said, \"No thank you I'd like to wait until I CAN have Sedation. The nurse just gave me medications to lower the Potassium levels to a safer level. I'd like to wait three hours, retest and revisit this surgery then.\" \nAnd this guy just goes OFF. Raising his voice at me and my boyfriend, TWO nurses had to come in and tell him to quiet down. So at this point, I'm sobbing (I have serious trauma with yelling and I already felt awful.) My boyfriend can do nothing but try to comfort me as we're STILL getting yelled at, and no one has come to help us yet. \n\nFinally, my hospitalist comes in and talks him down, telling him to wait outside. Then, she listens to me and says that's perfectly reasonable, she was sorry he treated us this way, and she would take care of everything.\nI was discharged three days later, and got a survey phone call where I got to tell someone else about what happened and in that weeks paper, it said he'd been fired. Apparently I wasn't the only one this happened to.\nSo, am AITA here?", "created_utc": 1679652014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120fmii/aita_for_getting_the_director_of_surgery_fired/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not acceptable for a medical professional to yell at a patient, especially one who is vulnerable and in a hospital setting. You were advocating for your own health and safety by asking to wait until you could have Sedation for the surgery, and the director of surgery had no right to yell at you for that. It is important for medical professionals to treat their patients with respect and compassion, and it sounds like this individual was not meeting those standards. It is understandable that you would feel traumatized by this experience, and it is good that action was taken to ensure that it does not happen to anyone else.", "Icu nurse here\u2026 def NTA! I wouldn\u2019t want surgery without sedation! F that. Don\u2019t feel bad and good on you for standing up for yourself.. sounds like that would have been a fun firing to witness \ud83d\ude02", "NTA  \n\nThis wasn't your fault.  He was totally unprofessional.  If the paper said that you weren't the only patient he had acted like that to, then believe them.  Your incident may have been the final straw but you are definitely not at fault", "NTA.\n\nYou were well within your rights. There was absolutely no reason to yell at you. He's reaping what he sowed.", "NTA. This dude made a habit of blowing his lid at patients. That is a sure-fire way to get your ass fired. He got what was coming to him.", "*Apparently I wasn't the only one this happened to.*\n\nObviously, it wasn't a one-off but was a pattern of behaviour. It doesn't matter if you were the first or the last to report it. You didn't get him fired. His unacceptable behaviour towards you and towards others got him fired.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI am wondering if this is even his first incident.", "NTA.  Obviously he had it coming.", "NTA\n\nTheir job is to do the best for the patient.\n\nOne complaint won\u2019t get them fired (might get them a warning or a chat about better ways to handle it) there needed to be others that contributed to his dismissal.", "NTA at all, but it's probably inaccurate to say you \"got him fired\". You've stated that it happened to other people, and it sounds like even without your input, he was heading for the high jump. Chances are,  you would have been reading about his dismissal regardless.\n\nEither way, he deserved it, and hopefully this will give him the opportunity to reflect on his behaviour and think about whether he is really suited to the medical profession. All you did is potentially stop him behaving like that to some other poor patient.", "NTA \n\nIf his outburst with you caused his dismissal then like they said, this has happened before. He clearly has a pattern of behavior. Your event was just the last straw. You have rights as a patient and should never tolerate being belittled or yelled at by a clinician.", "NTA. Doctors tried to kill me. I despise how they've all been sucked into the money machine. There were more pill selling suits in that pre-op room than nurses. This shit has to stop.", "It takes a lot for someone in a position like to get fired. If this story is true then it wasn\u2019t down to just your interaction.

You were a casualty of their ugliness.", "NTA. You might have been the evidence they needed to get rid of him finally. No one deserved to be treated that way by a medical professional. I bet all the staff at the hospital are quite happy he is gone.", "NTA", "that\u2019s terrible!!! no patient should ever be treated that way. nta!!!! not a world in which you could possibly be ta!", "Before I even read your post, I was going to say that if he was fired over it, he was either completely over the top or you were one of many patients he's mistreated, and that in either case guys firing is on him, not you. Since you noted that you're not the only one he's mistreated, I'm sticking by that. If he wasn't fired this time, he would have done it to someone else and been fired then.

I think though that the situation with you was probably just the final straw.  The surgeon has probably been an AH to other people, maybe not patients and maybe not as severely as he did with you though.  My guess is it wasn't the survey that got him fired, it was the multiple witnesses to what happened.\n\nIn any case, he is the a$$hole.\n\nBest wishes in healing OP!", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lying but it takes a lot to get someone fired. You weren\u2019t the one who got him fired, it would take several incidents. It doesn\u2019t ring true when you say you and this one incident got him fired.

You don't get fired after 1 bad day and a one-off yelling at a patient. You get fired for consistent yelling at patients and being more hassle to keep employed than to fire.

You didn't demand his removal and apart from that he deserved it.", "Definitely NTA. You didn't get him fired, he got himself fired.", "NTA. That man had no business treating patients when he clearly had lost control of himself. He was acting completely irrational and unstable.

You told the truth about a professional acting extremely unprofessional towards you.", "NTA. You didn't get the director of surgery fired for yelling at you.

Don\u2019t blame yourself.", "My dad\u2019s a doctor who\u2019s worked in hospitals for nearly 50 years, and there\u2019s no way a head of surgery would get fired over one incident like this, as unprofessional as it was. More likely this guy\u2019s got a lengthy history of being abusive\u2014which is not unheard of among a certain type of surgeon who think their lifesaving skills make them godlike and untouchable\u2014and your complaint was simply the last straw. Don\u2019t spend another second feeling guilty about this. NTA.", "NTA. He must've had some bad marks well before this incident. Doctors, especially surgeons, are in such high demand, it takes an act of Congress to fire their asses. This guy probably kept digging himself in deeper and deeper and screaming at you was the final straw for the hospital.", "NTA", "NTA, and you didn't get this man fired. This is not a waiter or a cashier that yelled at you, surgeons are very powerful - to have one fired there has to be a *LOT* of reasons behind it. \n\nAnd surgery without sedation is so ridiculous that it is why some people think your story is fake - even when it happens in movies it's in impossible circumstances.\n\nHe probably was on drugs/drunk too, which makes everything worse.", "Not the AH in the slightest.  Not wanting to have surgery without anesthesia seems to be about the most reasonable request on the planet!", "Hon, we don't call people who get abusive jerks who have no business being around patients because they can't control their tempers fired \"AHs\", we call them heros. Of course you're NTA. If he's treating multiple people like this, he NEEDS to be fired.", "As someone in a family of medical professionals, it takes a LOT to get a doctor fired.
