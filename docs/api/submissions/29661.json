I don't ask for much, because I I'm more than capable of doing or buying for myself.\n\nWhen we got engaged there was no proposal at all.  I knew he wanted to get married, because we talked about the life we wanted to build together (and we started building), but it was like pulling teeth to get a ring.  I finally got the ring and we did a really nice courthouse wedding (neither of us wanted anything more than that).  We always said that we didn't want to wedding, but we would have a reception for family and we will go on a honeymoon.  The reception happened, but the honeymoon did not.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and we still have not gone on our honeymoon.\n\nNow obviously this wouldn't be a true honeymoon, because it's been a couple of years and we have two beautiful children, but the one I only thing I truly wanted other than an amazing marriage and happy healthy children (which I have), was a nice, relaxing honeymoon that was just meant for the two of us.\n\nA couple of days ago I brought up going on a honeymoon again, and while my husband did not reject the idea, he didn't seem to want to talk about it, leaving me really upset.  I got very frustrated and angry and told him how I really felt.  I'm very mindful not to say anything hurtful, because words are strong and are very impactful, but I did bring up the fact that I do a lot for our family and I didn't even demand a huge wedding and that I think I am very deserving of a honeymoon.  \n\nNow, I am planning a honeymoon with or without him.  I am more than willing to travel anywhere by myself if he's not willing to plan this out with me.  At any moment he can tell me he wants to go and that would make me extremely thrilled, but until then I'm doing this alone.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698257930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gbbg3/aita_for_planning_a_honeymoon_without_my_husband/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The problem here is that YOU care and whether because he's an asshole or you're communicating it poorly to him; he doesn't seem to care that it bothers you.  So convey that to him.  You say he's a genuinely good person and supposedly he loves you - if you communicate this properly to him then he should respond in a way that you can figure out a solution together, not in a way where he feels pressured or guilt tripped into taking you on a vacation.\n\nAlso curious, in what way does he convey his love for you?  I feel like I can relate to him in that I don't care about a lot of these things, and if my girlfriend bugged me about some of it, I'd probably push it off.

And they split the chores worth a try? \n#3 if your happy with the split of workload then you both deserve a break/vacation whatever, if he doesn't enjoy traveling doesn't want to then you could both do different solo stuff. If you believe you do more in the partnership than him and want to be rewarded for that(you saying that you deserve the honeymoon) then you should negotiate that now, that you get to take a 1 week break alone every 2 years as a reward or whatever you guys decide just an example\n#4 stop being so passive with this. It doesn't seem from what you've said that you made it clear how important a honeymoon was, you didn't go cause of the baby at first? Maybe come up with a plan, where to go, what to do, what to do with the kids then present that to him? Like this is what I want to do with you so let's go. Unless you'd rather go alone which is a whole other conversation but I don't get the feeling you do\n#5 remember that this is a partnership so neither partner should be \"demanding\" something from the other. How much you spoke about you not \"demanding\" a big wedding and the ring and proposal in the original post when it's not relevant at all to the point, makes it seem like you want those things very much and are resentful of not getting them. Be careful cause if it's true and you won't admit it to yourself it will grow over time. You either need to get over it, or change it. \n#6 it seems pretty clear that your husband doesn't do big gestures or romantic stuff, so it shouldn't be a surprise that he wouldnt plan a honeymoon, the man showed you clearly from the start how he was with that, so expecting him to do it after you mentioned it once seems unrealistic\nSorry for the long post, but you seem too love this man so I hope things will be good", "NTA, but honestly it didn't sound like he wanted to get married.....\n\nThat aside, why do you keep calling it a honeymoon???

Plus you can't Honeymoon without your husband anyway.\n\nI think (I hope) what you want is a romantic getaway. A special trip with your husband free of all routine responsibility where you can really focus on each other.  Sell it like that. Talk about whether he'd like that too. Talk about length of time, budget, etc.  Ask if he wants to plan it together or would prefer you take the lead and come up with some ideas he might like.\n\nIf you really don't want a romantic focus on partner time, which might be possible as you're saying you'd go without him, then define it in another way. Say what you'd really like. Maybe to see a new place. Maybe to visit a big city.  Maybe you need a total break from routine responsibilities. You might want a luxury vacation where you can be very self indulgent. You might want a rural retreat where you can unplug and get away from it all. \n\nSaying you deserve a honeymoon is too imprecise. You are clearly yearning for something.

I don't ask for much, because I I'm more than capable of doing or buying for myself.\n\nWhen we got engaged there was no proposal at all.  I knew he wanted to get married, because we talked about the life we wanted to build together (and we started building), but it was like pulling teeth to get a ring.  I finally got the ring and we did a really nice courthouse wedding (neither of us wanted anything more than that).  We always said that we didn't want to wedding, but we would have a reception for family and we will go on a honeymoon.  The reception happened, but the honeymoon did not.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and we still have not gone on our honeymoon.\n\nNow obviously this wouldn't be a true honeymoon, because it's been a couple of years and we have two beautiful children, but the one I only thing I truly wanted other than an amazing marriage and happy healthy children (which I have), was a nice, relaxing honeymoon that was just meant for the two of us.\n\nA couple of days ago I brought up going on a honeymoon again, and while my husband did not reject the idea, he didn't seem to want to talk about it, leaving me really upset.  I got very frustrated and angry and told him how I really felt.  I'm very mindful not to say anything hurtful, because words are strong and are very impactful, but I did bring up the fact that I do a lot for our family and I didn't even demand a huge wedding and that I think I am very deserving of a honeymoon.  \n\nNow, I am planning a honeymoon with or without him.  I am more than willing to travel anywhere by myself if he's not willing to plan this out with me.  At any moment he can tell me he wants to go and that would make me extremely thrilled, but until then I'm doing this alone.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While everyone is picking over your choice of word, I understand what you are saying", "NTA. These comments are, I feel, sexist. The idea that women and moms shouldn't expect anything and not be angry, etc, is such a patriarchal viewpoint. You married this guy and had an agreement.  He broke the agreement, which isn't even about something out of reason. It's expected usually. Yes this should be a honeymoon because that is important to you that you keep that dream you had and it's gone to the wayside. He should be apologizing for not encouraging one sooner and for his bleh response. Is he worried about money? I would encourage you to talk to him about his expressions of disinterest and share how it makes you feel. Ask if something is holding him up and let him know it's important to you.

That just seems to be such an extreme jump. \n\nNow, it\u2019s entirely possible that this guy is the ignorant ass that he appears to be. But it\u2019s also possible that the honeymoon just fell by the wayside (as sometimes happens in life, when my mom got remarried they didn\u2019t go on their honeymoon until almost a year after the wedding due to life happening) and that he didn\u2019t realize OP was this upset about it. OP, just because you\u2019ve been stewing on this for years doesn\u2019t mean he has been doing it intentionally. Maybe he\u2019s been really stressed out being a parent, or maybe you guys don\u2019t do well financially and he\u2019s trying to keep his head above water there. \n\nBut based on what we have, you both seem like you suck and aren\u2019t capable of actually communicating.

I never had a courthouse wedding because he didn\u2019t plan one, we just went to sign and turn in the paperwork. We went on a several month delayed honeymoon/vacation because I bought the flights and booked the accommodation and made the itinerary. \n\nYes, I am more than capable of doing these things for myself, but it hurt to know that I wasn\u2019t worth the effort for him to do anything to make me happy.
