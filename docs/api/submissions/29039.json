I'm more quiet and reserved than my siblings and wasn't as interested in sports as them. My youngest brother (21M, Sam) is a big athlete and my parents favoritism is blatant. He can do whatever he wants, blame me, and my parents just believe him and punish me. For example, he took our dad's truck for a joyride and ended up hitting something leaving a huge dent in the door. He blamed me and I was grounded and my graduation party was cancelled. While I was at college the truth came out and Sam got no punishment. Or when he ruined my mom's fabric scissor, I was out with a friend when it happened but I still got grounded because Sam said I ruined them. I could go on but it always boils down to; Sam fucking something up, blaming me, and I get punished.\n\nAfter I graduated, I moved to the other side of the country for art school, and I never visited home during that time. I only kept in contact with my other brother, Will (23M), and we have a good relationship. Recently I got a new job that moved me close-ish to home and I told Will about it. My mom then contacted me and said we should all get together to celebrate. I was hesitant but my mom said we'd go to my favorite restaurant and they'd pay. Plus it would be the first time seeing Will in person in like 2 years. So I accepted.\n\nSam still lives with our parents and it was immediately apparent he hadn't really changed much in the past 6 years. He's coasting off his track scholarship and really doesn't seem to care much about anything. Anyways, on the day of the dinner, Sam starts complaining about the restaurant choice and saying he'd rather not go. After some back and forth between our parents and him, they ask if we could go somewhere else. I told them no. They can go somewhere else to coddle their golden boy but I came here for that restaurant and I was going to enjoy the food I wanted. Sam called me pathetic and childish for not compromising. I kinda saw red after that.\n\nI told him he was the pathetic one, he's a lazy s.o.b. who can't take an ounce of responsibility and couldn't last a week without our parents wiping his own ass for him. My mom told me off, saying I'm being nasty on what was supposed to be a happy day, and I told her I haven't felt happiness around the three of them since I was a kid. My dad called me a brat and demanded I apologize, and I told him to fuck off and that he doesn't have a shred of integrity after cancelling my graduation party and never apologizing after he found out it was Sam. My mom tried to defend him, but Sam said I was just being a dick because they weren't impressed enough I was a starving artist. I then told them all to fuck off and left.\n\nI called Will and have been staying with him until my flight on Wednesday. He told me I was right and justified, but it was harsh of me to say all that. He isn't asking me to apologize, but he did tell me our mom hasn't left her room since it happened.

Maybe your mum is currently having an epiphany as to how shitty they'd been towards you (nice you've got Will in your corner).\n\nThey are not likely to realize how damaging  their favouring the golden boy at your expense was, so living far away from them is the best thing you can do for your mental health.", "OP, go NC with everyone but Will. Your family\u2019s favoritism was just pure evil. I would suggest some counseling to ease your pain. \n\nBest wishes on your future. Be the best you can be. Screw your brother and your enabling parents. They are not worth loosing sleep over.\n\nNTA", "\"Mom hasn't left her room\" So? \n\nPerhaps she is feeling bad because she realizes now how bad a parent she was - ad will now get more evenhanded as a parent, demand that Sam start acting like a self-supporting adult. \n\nOr perhaps she can help dish it out but not take it. \n\nEither way, enjoy your time with your other sibling. You have learned that even now you cannot depend on your parents.   Go live a good life.", "NTA. Sam pulled a power play, to try to show you that he was still in control, and you basically told him you aren\u2019t playing the game anymore. And now he is sending your parents after you because that is all he has left in his life, whereas you have accomplishments beyond this - you actually have a life. After all, if he doesn\u2019t have you to bully, your brother has nothing.", "NTA. Your parents need to reach out and apologize for their role in the failure of your relationship first, imo. You have made enough distance - physically, geographically, emotionally - from them to not need that relationship the be flourishing, but they need to take accountability and responsibility in their role in it. Being called a brat and demanding apologies is not the way to do this.\n\nAnd your brother saying he wants a different place, seriously, but you are childish cause you don't want to change it. LOL", "NTA good for you!! It sounds like it was long overdue - sounds like Sam is a piece of work and your parents will regret their favouritism and indulging him hopefully it wont end up with someone getting seriously hurt. Thing is it sounds like Sam will always thing of himself which as your parents get older will be a problem cos they will need someone eventually and golden boy just wont be there. Poetic justice is glorious!!", "NTA. Assuming this is probably the only time someone has ever checked your parents regarding favoritism, your reaction was well warranted. Their reaction on the other hand was\u2026. yikes. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late and the damages are done for Sam, but I at least hope your folks take the time to think about their wrongs and work to make things right.", "A bit of reality never hurt anyone. Maybe they need it to start seeing how the golden child really is. \nShould have reminded them which ones have moved out and got on with their life and which one is still at home bleeding them dry!", "NTA \n\nYour family are all AHs (except Will).\n\nThey now know how you feel and why you felbthat way. go NC, and leave them a message via Will, that untill they all apologise for evrything it will stay that way.\n\nIt is good you have a brother you can still rely on.", "NTA\n\nI really feel like they don't respect you at all compared to Sam. It's hard not to go off the handle for the summation of decades of unfair treatment. It wasn't nice and it might not have been right but what did they honestly expect?", "NTA they have torn apart their family by abusing you and expecting you to just put up with the abuse. Speaking from experience, NC is difficult, but freeing in the end.", "NTA\n\nThink of it as lancing a boil. All this was building up inside you and they supposedly didn\u2019t know it. It needed to come out. At least you can all move on now. \n\nWhether things improve or not, at least you were open and honest.", "NTA. Good for you. Hopefully your parents introspect a bit now.", "NTA... Past behavior is a strong indicator of future behavior.  Even now, you get blamed because of your little brother.  As an adult, you get to decide how to spend your time and energy.  Unless your family is willing to resolve this, either through therapy or something else, there's no need to subject yourself to their chaos.", "NTA, seems totally justified based on you description.  I echo others' comments that you should go NC with everyone but Will and ask him not to share information with them.\n\nThere's no self-awareness or remorse from your parents or your youngest brother, so no need to subject yourself to more contact.", "Op.... Will ratted you out.  Are you sure he's a safe person to talk to?\n\n - He told your parents you were in town \n - He tells you he's \"on your side\" ***BUT***\n - He guilt trips you about your mother feeling the shame she ***should*** be feeling\n\nPlus you said he'd be at the dinner but you had to call him?  So he didn't show and left you with 3 people he knew you couldn't stand?  \n\nNTA\n\nBut watch out.  Will is playing both sides.  That's probably how he never got blamed for anything.", "Don't apologize. Find your own way. When you are ready you can open communication....preferably in front of a family therapist. \n\nAnd believe me...they know who Sam is. They just don't want to admit it.", "Good on you for saying what you needed to say. NTA. Your parents are responsible for creating this situation and allowing your brother to still act like this as an adult.", "Good lord! Your family sounds horrendous (except Will ofc)! You are 100% NTA", "Nope, NTAH. 42m here, as we grow older it\u2019s ok to move on from family, and keep whatever distance that make you feel comfortable. Crazy thing in life is when you realize those people (your fam) you grew up with for 18 years was just that\u2026the majority of your life will be spent without interacting with them. My wife and I have 3 kids and have been together for 23 years, and have spent most of that time living far away from most of both our families we came from. She and my kids; their my true family, and by comparison I care very little and my sibs or folk, but still love them whether I like them or not is a different story. Time to change your perspective and expectations. \nSending Love!", "NTA\nYour mother isn't your problem, let her stay in her room. Your parents have treated you horrendously and your youngest brother has been raised to believe he's superior to you.  You don't actually have to keep on contact with your family.", "NTA. Put bluntly your mother deserves whatever to feel whatever sadness that has led to her staying in her room. She and your father failed at being parents and don't like being called out. Will didn't experience what you did so his opinion is moot.", "oh no, the golden boy has to eat at a restaurant that isn't his favorite as his only consequence for repeatedly fucking you over. how hard that must be /s\n\nNTA I'm sure Will means well but only tell him things that you specifically want getting back to your family.", "NTA- As a fellow family scapegoat I am giving you a huge hug.\n\nYou don\u2019t need these people and I\u2019m sorry to say , this also includes Will.\n\nHim wanting you to keep the peace after everything just shows that he thinks of you the same way they do.\n\nGet some therapy so you can healthily move on and make your own family.", "NTA. Just stay happy and stay NC with these assholes.", "NTA- I would block them all indefinitely", "NTA  \nYou've swallowed their poop for 24 years, you have finally spoken the truth of your life with them.", "I don't think Sam actually cared about the restaurant.\n\nIt was all Powerplay, to show you who's in charge when you flew in especially.\n\nYou stood up for yourself when once again you were treated as a mere afterthought.\n\nGood for you.\n\n*<He isn't asking me to apologize, but he did tell me our mom hasn't left her room since it happened.>*\n\nIf that's true, about time she started reflecting on her actions towards er middle child.\n\nNTA", "Nta you all have let things fester and don't communicate until it all blows up.  That's not a great dynamic and you might want to see a family therapist to help you break those patterns", "NTA. They may not have liked hearing all that but it sure sounds like they needed to.", "NTA, you're right for everything, Sam, your mother and father don't care about you, they're shitty people, just enjoy your life and stay in contact with Will. If the other 3 aren't willing to apologize to you ang change their behavior, stay nc, you owe them nothing, you deserve to be happy and at peace.", "Your parents and brother earned every word you said and then some, sounds like. NTA", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong tho", "NTA --- I wonder if Will was also on the end of Sam blaming shit on him too?.", "NTA and I'm glad your mother hasn't left her room.  Maybe she's using the time to reflect on what terrible parents she and your dad have been. Enjoy your time with Will and don't bother with the rest of the family.", "NTA\n\nTruth hurts.", "Nta. Truth hurts.", "NTA.\n\nAnd sadly this won\u2019t ever stop. Sam sees it as his right to be more important than you.\n\nLive your life away from them.\nKeep in contact with Will though", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts, that is why most people hate it.", "NTA all day. From here on our just have Will to visit you, or not tell your parents if you visit him.", "NTA. You had enough and stood your ground. But now let it go. In 10 years you will have the life you worked hard for, and Sam will probably still be living with your parents. Who's the real winner here?", "NTA, it\u2019s good you finally stood up to them and said something. And make sure to cherish Will, he seems like a good one. \n\nWhy is your mom hiding out in her room? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. They were very upfront and non-apologetic about their favoritism and blaming you. So why is she upset now? I highly doubt she\u2019s having any sincere revelations about you since she hasn\u2019t reached out to apologize. She\u2019s probably just playing the victim and feeling sorry for herself in the hopes that you cave.", "Nope\u2026all of the rest of them FAFO'ed and I would basically ignore them from now on except for Will.", "NTA. Go no contact with all except Will.", "NTA - I'd go NC with everyone except will.", "So what? Your mother didn\u2019t leave her room. Maybe for one she realised how much she fucked up.\n\nDon\u2019t apologise or they will expect this from you forever.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Harsh but fair.  That distinction matters because it means that your harshness was coming from a lifetime of justified anger and resentment.", "NTA - drop everyone but Will.", "NTA. Sounds like this was a long time coming. \nDon't compromise your boundaries. If stepping away from family is what you need to do for your own peace of mind, do it. If they want you in their lives, they should have behaved better.", "NTA...looks like you gave your mom a well deserved dose of reality that she deserves.  Sounds like Dad and brother aren't likely to see what's clearly right in front of them, but fuck them!\n\nWrite a letter explaining how and why you feel the way you do with examples of how and why your childhood was shit, how it has and still affects your mental well being, and as it's clear nothing has changed after several years you need to go NC with them for your own mental health.", "NTA. You certainly put your position clearly and mom and dad are in their rooms because they know you're right and they need to parse their guilt. Don't worry about it, it sounds like you're on the right path by getting away from your \"Three Stooges.\"", "NTA.   Being distant was a good idea.  They haven\u2019t changed so go distant again.", "NTA. And thank you for standing up for yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter how they feel about the situation because they\u2019re the root problem here. Your mom not leaving her room? Cool. Don\u2019t ostracize your children and you won\u2019t have to bear the consequences to those actions. You were absolutely right to call them out. It\u2019s clear they haven\u2019t changed so you\u2019re better off not putting yourself in a position where you have to be reminded of the treatment you went through. Until they\u2019re ready to own up and apologize, they don\u2019t deserve contact with you.", "NTA I think they needed a reality check and when you think about it, the relationship was already in the tank. It\u2019s not like you made it worse. You just weren\u2019t as passive as they might be used to.", "What's harsh about the truth? \n\nYour mother needs to stay in her room.

Parents seldom change their relationship once they've selected the favorite. Maybe your mother is actually realizing how wrong and unfair she and your father have been, but I doubt it. In any case, they're stuck in the old pattern; Sam asks, they give, your wishes will always come last, only Sam gets fulfilled.\nBest to write them off. Oh, and one day, they'll need money for Sam, you should refuse. Because art may or may not be a lucrative career path, but former track star most definitely is not!", "It sounds like it was necessary to say. Maybe it's the wakeup call your parents needed.

I\u2019m dealing with something similar and it\u2019s just a no-win situation.", "NTA..  but I don't see the point in having a relationship with them, plus there's no point in bring up the past, it's the past & your never going to get them to say their wrong", "NTA. Something my therapist told me when I was concerned about random outbursts I\u2019d have once or twice a year: when you\u2019re surrounded by people doing wrong or who are unhealthy and you\u2019re the only one who sees it for what it is, eventually you\u2019ll be gaslit enough to either roll over or have an outburst. \n\nThis confrontation was a long time coming and of course you\u2019d be so passionate about it. They\u2019ve done you wrong so much for so many years. To them it\u2019s \u201cout of nowhere\u201d because nobody has ever tried to hold them accountable for their shitty behavior before (at least in this situation) and they thought they were coasting. It was a rude awakening for them and, since they\u2019re all in the same unhealthy pattern together, they\u2019ll think they\u2019re right because there\u2019s more of them than you. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole, not in the slightest.

Your parents are enabling him, so prepare yourself for fighting him for any kind of inheritance.\n\nIf you're good with your parents not being in your life, wait for them to apologize. But do realize that they may never be able to, and Sam will try to make sure it never happens. He has a cush place without having to lift a finger and your parents (for now) are ok with it.\n\nYou have to decide what you want in terms of a relationship with your parents. I'd advise talking to a professional about dealing with your sense of loss and unfairness. It will be good for you to learn to leave it behind, no matter what you decide you want from your parents.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTell Will that you will be happy to keep up with him and visit with him, but he needs to not be a messenger of what Sam or Sam's enabling parents are doing or saying. Those three are not your family.\n\nGuaranteed - one day parents will need help with something and someone will ask you to be the one to help.

They\u2019re mad you popped their dellusional little bubble. They\u2019ve been under the impression that there was no harm done, that there was nothing wrong with them coddling sam, and that you being blamed for it all wasnt a big deal. Deep down they know it is, they just won\u2019t allow themselves to think about it because then they\u2019d have to take some real accountability. Your mom not leaving her room likely has more to do with her re analyzing your childhood and starting to realizing it wasn\u2019t as good as she convinced herself it was. I\u2019m also sure that they probably did miss you, and wanted to see you after having little to no contact for so long. \n\nThey\u2019d thought it would be a new beginning and that they wouldn\u2019t have to address anything they did to cause you to cut contact . I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your mom is starting to realize sams the reason she no longer has a relationship with you. Regardless it doesn\u2019t matter what she\u2019s actively contemplating, the only thing that matters are her actions moving forward. She can feel bad internally all she wants, but it means jack shit if they don\u2019t make an effort to make things right or change the dynamic. They don\u2019t get to treat you like shit and just expect you to just take it because they\u2019re not ready to deal or have that conversation. Honestly Op, there\u2019s a chance they may never be ready. Regardless for now I think it\u2019s best you go back to no contact. Either your mom wises up in your absence and realizes her favoritism cost her her son; or she doesn\u2019t and never changes. Either way distance is needed.\n\nThe distance will either force her to make a change; or it won\u2019t and if it doesn\u2019t then you shouldn\u2019t be around her anyway.  You deserve better than this OP. Listen no family is perfect, no parents are perfect but this is past sibling rivalry and slight favoritism. This is abuse, your parents emotionally abused you for years. Don\u2019t let yourself be convinced that you over reacted, you didn\u2019t. They\u2019re just pissed that you finally spoke up. That you didn\u2019t shut up and accept being scapegoated to appease their conscious.  D eowwww I\u2019d also recommend limiting info with will that you don\u2019t want getting back to your parents. I do believe he\u2019s on your side, and that he loves you and would probably do anything for you; but they\u2019re his parents too and he still feels loyalty to them. He\u2019s not going to refuse to feed them information because you say so, especially if your mom tries to guilt trip or manipulate him into spilling. They never should have even known about the job or the move.

That said, nothing I said was untrue, and I am glad you now know how I feel. You have always favored Sam, you have historically punished me when he lied and blamed me for what he did, and even when it came out, he was never someone you cared to punish. No, that was me. Your favoritism has seemingly ruined him as a person, and he and I will not have a relationship in the future. While I initially had reservations about dinner, both because of how you have treated me over the years, and because he would be present, I agreed, thinking it wouldn't be an issue to have one dinner. But of course, Sam is Sam, he's ill-mannered and entitled, and he is accustomed to you indulging his whims, so of course he demanded a different restaurant, expecting me to \"compromise\" by letting him have his way. Now, while I have come to accept that, for whatever reason, he is the son you prefer, I no longer have any need to tolerate his selfish behavior, nor to concern myself with the consequences of his lies, or your reaction to how I feel. At any rate, while I am disappointed Sam is still a spoiled brat, 8 woukd be happy to get dinner with the teo of you and Will sometime down the road. Maybe we can try again in a few months. Though if you prefer not to, I get it. I don't expect things to suddenly change just bc I am closer now.\"", "NTA. This was long overdue. The way your parents and eldest brother treated you in your childhood is evil, and frankly I hope you never spend time with them again after this. Whenever you think \"maybe they've changed\" or \"maybe I should give them another chance\", remember this dinner.\n\nI'm kind of harsh, so I'd recommend giving Will an ultimatum; you'll only stay in contact with him if he promises to never pass on information about you to the parents again.
