{"id": 26798, "submission_id": "16hwkj3", "title": "AITA for not taking down our 12-foot-skeleton because a neighbor\u2019s son is afraid of it?", "selftext": "Okay, so we moved to this neighborhood back in April and have been making so many plans for Halloween decorations. I have always wanted the giant skeleton. If you aren\u2019t familiar, just search \u201c12 foot skeleton\u201d and you\u2019ll find it. I finally ordered one!\n\nWe put it up on September 1st because I was just too excited to wait. People on my street all laughed about it and the teens down the street came to take pictures with it. My next door neighbor is going to make stuff to go with it.\n\nUnfortunately there\u2019s younger kids who are a few streets away who see it on their walk home from school and one of them cries and gets scared of it. So the mom approached me and asked if I could possibly take it down because it\u2019s a little too scary.\n\nIMO it\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s silly. I don\u2019t like scary Halloween, I like silly Halloween. I don't even listen to True Crime podcasts like every other basic girl these days (**I wrote this drinking a PSL. It's me, I'm the basic girl. Stop getting your panties in a knot. I'm literally watching Gilmore Girls right now. The call is coming from inside the house. It is a joke about ME being basic. True crime is literally one of THE most popular, trendy things for young women right now. It's Taylor Swift, True Crime, PSL. I like 2/3 of these things. Please blink if you understand the joke. Do you still not get it? Hi, I'm too much of a baby to like true crime. I cannot go Fully Basic. I am only part-time basic. Jesus Christ tell me you get it NOW?**). I asked the mom if putting on a silly hat, a boa, silly shirt or something would work. She said no and asked again for me to take it down.\n\nI told her that I have wanted one of these forever and that I am not going to take it down. I suggested she find a different route to/from the bus stop. She made a face and said \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nI said I spent $300 on this bad boy and I want to enjoy it. Not to sound too dramatic, but in this world on fire, something as stupid as a 12 foot skeleton brings me joy.\n\nThen she looked behind me and smirked and said that $300 shouldn't break the bank, but that judging by the house we bought, she should have realized money was an issue for us. Then she said \u201cBut it costs nothing to be kind to a little boy who is scared.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not particularly clever or quick, so I said \u201cOkay, well, thanks for the suggestion\u201d and went back to weeding. She stood there and then took a picture, presumably to \u201cblast me on social media\u201d or her mommy groups or whatever. Whenever she walks by she scowls (doorbell cam) and takes another picture.\n\nMy husband agrees we don\u2019t need to take it down. There is no HOA or anything. Her going down a different street would not even add more to her walk to get the kids. I think she is being unreasonable and playing up that whole corny \u201cmama bear\u201d thing.

This is an ancient and sacred tradition up there with showing off embarrassing baby pictures. \n\nShe could schedule an afternoon for little Billy to come meet you and the skeleton and see that it's just plastic or something, but no, she just HAS to make a war out of it.

I have always wanted the giant skeleton. If you aren\u2019t familiar, just search \u201c12 foot skeleton\u201d and you\u2019ll find it. I finally ordered one!\r  \n\r  \nWe put it up on September 1st because I was just too excited to wait. People on my street all laughed about it and the teens down the street came to take pictures with it. My next door neighbor is going to make stuff to go with it.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately there\u2019s younger kids who are a few streets away who see it on their walk home from school and one of them cries and gets scared of it. So the mom approached me and asked if I could possibly take it down because it\u2019s a little too scary.\r  \n\r  \nIMO it\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s silly. I don\u2019t like scary Halloween, I like silly Halloween. I don't even listen to True Crime podcasts like every other basic girl these days (I wrote this drinking a PSL). I asked the mom if putting on a silly hat, a boa, silly shirt or something would work. She said no and asked again for me to take it down.\r  \n\r  \nI told her that I have wanted one of these forever and that I am not going to take it down. I suggested she find a different route to/from the bus stop. She made a face and said \u201cReally?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI said I spent $300 on this bad boy and I want to enjoy it. Not to sound too dramatic, but in this world on fire, something as stupid as a 12 foot skeleton brings me joy.\r  \n\r  \nThen she looked behind me and smirked and said that $300 shouldn't break the bank, but that judging by the house we bought, she should have realized money was an issue for us. Then she said \u201cBut it costs nothing to be kind to a little boy who is scared.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m not particularly clever or quick, so I said \u201cOkay, well, thanks for the suggestion\u201d and went back to weeding. She stood there and then took a picture, presumably to \u201cblast me on social media\u201d or her mommy groups or whatever. Whenever she walks by she scowls (doorbell cam) and takes another picture.\r  \n\r  \nMy husband agrees we don\u2019t need to take it down. There is no HOA or anything. Her going down a different street would not even add more to her walk to get the kids. I think she is being unreasonable and playing up that whole corny \u201cmama bear\u201d thing.

NTA", "Because I don\u2019t yell at people on the 4th of July?", "I just think it's kind of ridiculous for an adult and a child to be having a proxy fight over a Halloween decoration. Does this thing really need to be up for two months? Can't OP be the grown up?", "People also don\u2019t want to live near people who enjoy scaring small children for their own entertainment. Do you also enjoy injuring small animals for fun?", "There are neighborhoods in my area where a million dollar hime is next to a trailer/old mobile home, and it's been like that for decades.", "One year I did the legs squashed by the garage door with a puddle of \"blood\". All the kids loved it. Some tried looking inside.\n\nAnother year I did a \"corpse\" wrapped in garbage bags. Another hit. One kid even asked me if it was a real body hahaaha", "There's this one house that puts him a giant killer clown for Halloween. I'm very scared of clowns. (Thanks, Stephen King and Tim Curry.) But I wouldn't go around demanding they take it down. I just avoid the house.", "I love you", "One of my neighbors set up two skeletons playing chess. People would walk by and make moves on the board, so they set up an arrow that people could move after taking their turn to show which side would go next. It got really exciting to walk by to see which skeleton was winning!", "How about \"little boys are yummy\"", "Haha. Well that makes me laugh. I wonder how old the boy is though.", "They make flamingo skeletons! The possibilities for his yard are endless\u2026", "You are now my favorite people ever. I want pictures of this 8th wonder y'all created.", "Now o know what do with the small skeleton I was gifted.  Ride the skeleton flamingo it is!", "I saw a 50 pack of yard flamingos recently. You could have an army of them.", "One of the dollar stores had pink flamingos available this summer. Guess who bought 50 of them in preparation for Halloween? (It\u2019s me. They attack in 2 weeks).", "eskeletion", "SKELETON ARMY!!", "I think I can speak for everyone when I say we would all love to see that", "Please pm me a picture of this?!", "At a destination wedding. Somewhere tropical.", "Bonus for South Park references. :)", "And keep it up all the way until 12/26!", "I want this!", "Only if the boner is a smaller skeleton", "Kids start school at 4 where I live for Junior Kindergarten.", "> That doesn't make any sense.

And that's 100% on you and not me, because I love being basic AF. Sorry if you don't!", "Girlypop I love being basic AF, it is NOT my problem if you still have a hangup about it. I'mma enjoy the fuck out of my PSL, Gilmore Girls, thrift shopping and pumpkin muffins and if you don't want to, that's on you, but don't get mad because other people have embraced being basic.", "By 'you' I meant 'the group of people who think true crime podcasts make them safer, of which you are a member', not you in the singular. I don't know you well enough to say if you're paranoid personally, obviously, but you do seem real angry going by a quick scan of your recent comments, so I'm going to move on with my day.", "True, although tone doesn\u2019t translate via text so it\u2019s quite understandable why they would take it in a way OP didn\u2019t intend (Especially since evidently the PSL acronym was not understood, so it was likely ignored).\n\nAlso love the handle, got a good laugh from that thx.", "Yikes, sorry you hate fun!", "I've just always though it was really sad how uptight people get about the calendar. What's wong with enjoying things when you want to enjoy them? Why wait until some arbitrary day on the calendar? Why make soooo many rules for yourself?\n\nAnd why get so bothered by other people doing things they love? It's decorations. How much of an impact does it have on your life?\n\nIdk, it just must be exhausting to care so much about things being \"just so\" and applying that to the world around you.", "let people have their fun on their yard.", "Ahhh yeah I've never been into that whole \"living by arbitrary rules\" thing. I do things when I want to do them, I don't sit around waiting for arbitrary dates on calendars to do things just because someone says I have to. Life's way too short to sit around waiting for the right \"season\" to do something fun.", "BOO YA BROTHER!", "We all live as part of our community. Sure, OP is totally within their right to keep skelly exactly as-is, and neighbor can just deal with it. \n\nBut why create fearful/angry/hurt/whatever other negative feelings over such a small thing? Because now there will be mutual side-eye and negativity every time the neighbors see one another. The world is a shitty enough place as it is, why create conflict?\n\nMaybe the mom is unreasonable and wouldn't have accepted anything other than total skeletal removal. But would it have been that big of a deal to continue trying to problem solve? After all, they have 2 full months to do so.", "Dude, I live near two homes that each have a 12 foot skeleton up all year round, decorated according to the season or holiday.\n\nDefinitely makes a lot of people in the neighborhood happy!", "Lmfao this is such a classic R/AITA overreaction. Next thing you're going to be telling me to divorce my husband.", "How neat! My neighbor fills his whole yard with skeletons. He even has a Bob Ross skeleton painting a picture. I\u2019m going to suggest he set up a chessboard if he\u2019s looking for new ideas.", "\"it's for a 12 foot skeleton, not me! It's a joke I swear!\"", "I\u2019ll have to ask him to send me pictures. If I remember they were positioned to look like they were chasing gnomes. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be going back up shortly.", "Make an army!", "Gonna need skeletons coming out of the ground", "I'll take a picture tomorrow when I walk the doggo, and comeback to share it here!", "I'll take a picture tomorrow when I walk the doggo!", "Our neighbors never even took theirs down and it makes me so happy. His giant ass has been protecting their house for the past 365 days", "No, just take it down when you take down the Christmas lights, late February or so...... like normal people!", "Us poor people have never heard of pre-k lol", "Girly pop, what\u2019re you 5? I didn\u2019t ask your whole life story. You\u2019re not the main character. You asked if you\u2019re the asshole and yes you are. If you\u2019re fighting against it, why even ask?", "I was totally kidding. I think that gigantic skeleton is awesome even if my 3 year old doesn't like it.

We're planning for Halloween 2024 though and it'll be BIIIIIIG, I can't wait to see your neighbors set up!", "That's amazing. OP should do this and decorate it for each holiday.", "You're welcome.  I even decorated it for various holidays throughout the year.", "We have a few skeleton guardians in my town. They are up 365 (366 next year). Some get decorated, one has a solar spotlight so it's visible at night", "I posted this already but a little corner market near me leaves theirs up all year and  dresses it up for all holidays and seasons", "Well, I don't know where you live, but here in NYC universal pre-k is free at public schools, and there's an increasing push to make more children eligible for free preschool at the age of 3.\n\nChildren start pre-k at the age of 4-ish - although we actually have the latest cut-off date in the country and they only have to be 4 by December 31 of that year (and 5 by December 31 of that year to enter kindergarten), so a significant portion of incoming pre-k students turn 4 after starting school.", "Can you point to where in my post I say that?", "Tbh I was more referring to my own childhood like 25 years ago where I definitely didn\u2019t go to pre k haha. That\u2019s cool to hear about NYC though. Idk if WA state is similar", ">So the mom approached me and asked if I could possibly take it down because it\u2019s a little too scary.  IMO it\u2019s not scary\n\nIt is not up to your opinion if her child finds it scary.  He does.  His mother told you.\n\n>I said I spent $300 on this bad boy and I want to enjoy it.\n\nAnd here is you saying you want to enjoy it.", "found the complaining mother lmao", "Reading comprehension isn't one of your strong suits, I take it?", "Oh, this might be a language barrier thing? I'm assuming you're not a native English speaker. \"I want to enjoy it\" means enjoy the skeleton. Like, enjoy the decoration that I put up. \n\nIt's not related to the kid at all.", "I wouldn't have wasted my time complaining.  Actions speak louder than words.", "> \"I want to enjoy it\" means enjoy the skeleton. Like, enjoy the decoration that I put up.\n\nThe emotions the skeleton created are what you wanted to enjoy.  To you, it creates fun and silliness; to the child, it created fear and terror.\n\nIf you can still feel fun and silliness while knowing that small children are scared and afraid, that is your business.  But it also makes you an asshole."]}
