He said it would probably be \"a dinner an maybe a couple drinks\". He ended up coming home at 5:30 am. Drunk as a sailor on leave, smelling like a distillery. I told him to sleep on the couch because our toddler was sleeping next to me in our bed. He did not agree. Safe to say I didn't really sleep after that. \n\nToday I find out he'd spent most of the night partying with a woman I know he has a crush on (he admitted this to me recently). Nothing happened and I believe him. But I think it's super disrespectful towards me and I am horribly disappointed in him. \n\nBackground info; we have a 3-yo together and have nobody to help so it's only us. It's been really tough and I've had a hard time with my mental health. He says the other woman feels like a breath of fresh air and that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill since nothing happened. \nHe doesn't party all that often, maybe every two months. But maybe 2* a year he goes on a boys trip for several days and that's all partying. \n\nSo: husband parties with his crush and leaves me alone with our kid.
