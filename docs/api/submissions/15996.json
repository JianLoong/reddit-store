He said it would probably be \"a dinner an maybe a couple drinks\". He ended up coming home at 5:30 am. Drunk as a sailor on leave, smelling like a distillery. I told him to sleep on the couch because our toddler was sleeping next to me in our bed. He did not agree. Safe to say I didn't really sleep after that. \n\nToday I find out he'd spent most of the night partying with a woman I know he has a crush on (he admitted this to me recently). Nothing happened and I believe him. But I think it's super disrespectful towards me and I am horribly disappointed in him. \n\nBackground info; we have a 3-yo together and have nobody to help so it's only us. It's been really tough and I've had a hard time with my mental health. He says the other woman feels like a breath of fresh air and that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill since nothing happened. \nHe doesn't party all that often, maybe every two months. But maybe 2* a year he goes on a boys trip for several days and that's all partying. \n\nSo: husband parties with his crush and leaves me alone with our kid.

He got married right at 18, joined the Navy (for benefits and steady paycheck), and had 4 kids back to back. He and his (now ex) wife basically had a baby every year so they had 4 kids 4 years old and under by the time they turned 23. By 25, he was telling me things about how he loved talking to me, how his wife just doesn\u2019t understand him anymore, how she doesn\u2019t get how hard deployments are and how tired he is when he gets back. I told him multiple times I was NOT the person to be sharing this with and that he needs to actually communicate with his wife (who was also a good friend of mine by this point and who I knew struggled with his attitude but she didn\u2019t share that often because she didn\u2019t want to feel like she was gossiping or \u201cairing their dirty laundry\u201d). Two months late she calls me sobbing because he told her he had kissed another woman and it \u201cjust happened\u201d but it \u201cdidn\u2019t mean anything\u201d and the other woman just \u201cgets him\u201d and \u201callows him to be himself\u201d. The ex wife tried to stay for their kids. Didn\u2019t last another month before he told her he had sex with the other woman and it was the best he ever had and he finally was feeling like a man again. During their divorce proceedings, the other woman absolutely lost her mind. Called the ex wife at all hours of the day using burner phones, tried picking the kids up from school and saying she was their real mom, tried getting the school to bar the ex wife from any kind of communication about the kids or allowing the ex wife to actually pick them up, called the pediatrician and tried conning them into releasing the kids\u2019 medical information because she (the other woman) was their mom now\u2026and this is none of the physical stuff I can\u2019t share on this sub that she did either.
