If you don\u2019t want your children to feel a way about the gifts, especially if no one told them she\u2019s dying, then it may be best to leave. You all don\u2019t have to exchange gifts together. The moment of children getting gifts is only important to the kid and their parent. You all don\u2019t have to do group gifts. Maybe get an Airbnb or a hotel suite.

Some kids will get more and others less.  Your kids will need to learn that - and it is your job to help them accept that.  This concept that other people should adjust so your kids don't feel slighted goes around every christmas - which makes me wonder if this isn't an experiment to see if people's opinion changes when one kid is dying.  Either way - it is nobody's job to make sure your kids get the same as everyone else.  They never will.  Sometimes they'll get more.  Sometimes less.\n\nThen we toss back the dying child into the equation... and life still isn't fair.  But this time it's not fair to the dying child and her family.

If you divide it up over the 80 or 90 years she should be getting on this earth, is it still more presents than she should get? \n\nI\u2019d do as little soul searching. Think of all the hugs and gifts and moments and words and giggles and LOVE you are going to miss out on with this little girl over her whole entire life.
