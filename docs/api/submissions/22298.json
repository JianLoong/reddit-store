He called beforehand to let me know he left his car in the office car park and was planning on sleeping in it (in the safe car park) that night to avoid spending lots of money on a taxi. At the time, neither of us knew this was illegal. I was a bit apprehensive of this idea but just told him to enjoy his night and be safe.\n\nWe both use an app called Find Friends to see where the other is (which we usually just use to make sure dinner is ready when the other comes home from work). I travel a lot with work, and am currently in a different continent to my partner. \n\nIt reached 1:30am in our home country, and I hadn't heard from my partner since he'd left work. I decided to check Find Friends and see if he'd gone to his car in his office car park.\n\nInstead, the app showed that he was on a very narrow and windy country lane, which ran parallel to a river. I kept watching for a while in the hopes that he was in a taxi, but his location remained the same. \n\nI'd tried to call and text to no response. I suffer from anxiety so at this point I'm thinking the worst (did he drunkenly drive there and crash? did he get lost? fall into the river?).\n\nThe longer I looked at the map the more I became physically sick with worry. After trying and failing to contact him and our friends (it was 2am by this point so they were asleep), I decided to call the local police station where he was and ask them to check to see if he was there and okay. \n\nA few hours later, I received a call from an officer letting me know that he had been arrested for sleeping in his car while intoxicated. He was taken to the police station and would spend the night in a cell.\n\nAt this point, despite being relieved that he was okay, I felt such an overwhelming feeling of guilt. If I hadn't intervened, he probably would've slept the night there and driven home safely in the morning. I was also confused as to how his car got there from his office, and started spiralling thinking about the consequences if he'd been drink driving. \n\nHe called this morning to let me know he had spent the night in a cell. Apparently his friend drove the car over to this little road for him, and he slept there because it was quieter than the car park. His friend was sober and planned on walking to his girlfriend's house, so my partner asked if he'd drive his car for him and park it in a lay-by halfway down the road.\n\nThankfully all charges have been dropped, but he's angry that I got the police involved and I feel guilty for putting him through unnecessary stress. I feel like if something bad happened to him I wouldn't have been able to live with myself just ignoring the situation, but I overlooked the possibility that someone would drive his car to a different area for him.\n\nAITA?\n\nedit for legal purposes: this is the UK", "created_utc": 1689422360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150a74r/aita_for_calling_the_police_to_check_on_my_partner/", "score": 556, "replies": ["NTA.

If she actually worried about his safety (absolutely nothing in this story indicates any rational reason to be afraid), she could have woken someone local up to go check on him. Or she could just accept that the infinitely small chance that he's in such danger that he can't call and no one else has seen anything, but also still alive and in need of rescue is still smaller than the risk of violence, arrest, job loss, embarrassment and terror calling the cops entails. And therefore just wait it out.", "Okay stretching there.  I see you can\u2019t be rational.  \n\nFYI he\u2019s the one responsible for HIS actions.  Don\u2019t want arrested don\u2019t get stupid drunk and sleep in your car just take a damn taxi home.\n\nEdit-Wording", "No, he doesn\u2019t answer to her, but if you read the post, you\u2019ll see that at no point did she actually tell him what to do, or give him an ultimatum. She was \u2018a bit apprehensive\u2019 of his idea, but told him to have fun.\n\nHe then deviated from his own idea, in a way that made him look to be in an unsafe situation, so she called the police because she was worried about his safety. She made a judgment call out of concern for his safety. Had he actually been in a dangerous situation, which he really fucking easily could have been, he\u2019d have been grateful. You, and him, are just hind-sighting the shit out of the outcome, with zero thought given to the context of the situation.", ">If he had been in a crash, someone else would have seen it and called for help.\n\nHow on earth do you know? He was on a windy little road.\n\n>Or he would have called for help.\n\nNot if he's badly injured he probably cant. \n\n>If she actually worried about his safety (absolutely nothing in this story indicates any rational reason to be afraid),\n\nOh come on don't be obtuse, ofc this looked dangerous, he was in a different place to where he said he would be, the place was seemingly very random and he was completely stationary.

And therefore just wait it out.\n\nNo it isnt, the risk of injury and death by police safe and welfare check is far far smaller than the risk of dying or being seriously injured in a car accident. You're unlikely to lose your job following an arrest unless you are convicted, and as she says, she didnt even know he'd done anything illegal.", "He would have been perfectly fine if she didn't send the cops after him.\n\nHer actions led to his arrest. The cops were not there looking for him. She made them aware of the situation. \n\nShe's controlling. And mentally ill.", "Ok, cop lover. Go and stalk your friends and call the cops on them when they're in unusual locations.

He's the one you should be holding accountable, not OP for being worried.", "NTA if nothing else if he was planning to drive home in the morning after getting so drunk he couldn\u2019t even hear his mobile phone in close confines then he would have still been over the limit in the morning when he would have been driving home. You could have saved a life by calling the police, thankyou.", "NTA. You needed to know he was safe. He might not have been safe sleeping there.", "NTA.

Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s mega suffocating to have it normalized that friends, family, or partners are tracking your every move, to the point that not reporting in on a minor change of plans leads to someone calling law enforcement? I understand that op was worried, but if not for the regular surveillance he would have had the autonomy to just have a spontaneous night out like a normal person would have been able to even like 5 years ago. That being said, sleeping in his car wasn\u2019t a safe (or, as pointed out, legally sound) plan to begin with.", "YTA. You spied on your BF and didn't show any trust in him. You involved police which is a good way to get someone killed btw or an arrest record which can hurt their career and reputations. \n\nNext time don't be stupid and call a friend", "Holy shit YTA. Your anxiety literally got him arrested. Nothing else matters. That\u2019s an instant break up and move out if this happened to me.", "Nta. Yes, if you did nothing, he would have been fine. You did have legitimate reason to believe that he was in danger, because he did not communicate a change in plan to you. If he was in danger, you calling for help could have been the only thing to save him. He should have let you know the change in plan.\n\nThis situation has parallels to the boy who cried wolf. We trust our loved ones to communicate their safety accurately, if they do not, they risk endangering themselves when they are actually in danger, because we cannot accurately assess what is a dangerous situation when they are alone", "NTA. This all sounds quite immature and irresponsible. It\u2019s really his own fault for being so ridiculous. I would have freaked out as well.", "Nta", "NTA.", "NTA my fianc\u00e9e lives in a different continent as well, and when I don't hear from her for hours despite a very predictable routine / schedule, I start to worry. I can definitely understand your sense of panic and anxiety in this situation. Yeah it didn't end up in an ideal situation, but on the flip side if something *had* happened to him, you could have saved his life.", "Sounds like he's playing a game where the winner has to make a series of stupid decisions no resonating adult makes. NTA.", "NTA-  But whoever made it illegal to sleep in your own car is TA.\n\nWould they prefer drunk , or overtired drivers on the road?", "This is why I hate all this tracking technology and anything that lets us track where and when somebody has been. It's anxiety inducing. Before all this we didn't know where our loved ones were and relied on where they said they would be and we were entirely fine not knowing otherwise. Now we are all paranoid.\nNTA OP, I get your reasoning, but I also totally see why BF would be pissed.", "NTA", "YTA. An unpopular opinion I think based on everyone else's comments but I am not sure how you couldn't know this is illegal.  I hate to say that I feel like your anxiety over took you and you didn't care the consequences for your partner if it eased your anxiety.  The fact that your partner is upset with you means he likely has the same belief as me.\n\nI've lived in the UK and it is pretty common knowledge not to sleep off a bender in your car because you can get charged.  I am now in Canada which has common law like the UK and this is literally told to us from our teens (don't sleep off drinking in your car because you'll get charged).  Frankly, his plan to drive home in the morning means he would most likely drive drunk...cops literally sit across the street from pubs on Saturday and Sunday early mornings waiting for people to come back for their cars since most likely they'll still blow over if they majorly over indulged the night before.  He shared his plan with you knowing he was skirting the rules and you burned him by calling the cops.", "The thing that gets me is if the friend was going to drive him somewhere else anyway, why not just drive him home? Why drive him to the middle of nowhere? That just makes no sense at all and all the more reason OP did the right thing here.", "This. If a truly sober person was driving him around, they wouldn\u2019t have left him sleeping in a car on a dark windy road late at night - if anything, being in that situation, he could have easily been struck by a totally unrelated drunk driver. A sober friend would have brought him home (or to crash on the couch of whichever friend lived closest). OP, you know him better than we do, but it sounds like he drove himself there while drunk and not only did you make the right decision in calling, but the cops were right to bring him in / monitor him for the night. What if he had woken up an hour later, still intoxicated, and decided to finish the drive after feeling \u201csobered up\u201d by his nap?", "He didn't drove himself a sober friend did but the rest of what you wrote is right on the money.\n\nNTA op", "It was 46 hours, 3 dead and 2 critical.

We trust each other completely so it's not an issue for us, just something that makes life and scheduling a bit easier", "Are you American by any chance?", "What a weird comment.

Absolutely terrible.", "If the charges were dropped, I'm guessing the cops verified his story (spoke to the friend and the person friend walked over to stay with). But the suspicion is understandable.", "She said in another comment that the sober friend would walk all the way to meet his girlfriend and decided to drive halfway and walk the rest. \n\nEither their friends are not the smartest or OP is being naive.", "Half an hour walk is like what 10- 15 min drive? Why would he drive only half of it and let your boyfriend in a shitty place and drunk alone?\n\n\nThe reasoning must be really good for you to believe that.", "So why didn't the friend offer a couch or even his driveway to your boyfriend? Either there is no friend and he drove himself there, or the friend was still there and for some reason your boyfriend doesn't want to admit this to you.", "Info: is this friend insured on your partner's car?", "A half hour walk is a 2 minute drive. You really believe that his friend drove 1 minute of a 2 minute drive before walking the remaining half mile?", "I understand your perspective, and don\u2019t fault you for it personally, as it individual. It just really creeps me out that tech culture has expanded to the point that monitoring location has been normalized and even something that a lot of people are fine with. There was another thread where a bunch of parents talking about seeing no problem with constantly tracking their kids, and to me it\u2019s just bad vibes all around. I have personally never had anyone ask to monitor my location, or asked to monitor anyone else\u2019s - a simple text or call has sufficed when needed.

I wouldn't be turning down a free drive in a car over walking, what, half a mile?", "You need professional help if you think drink driving is ok.", "Hope she dumps his for being so irresponsible.", "He definitely would have been arrested for running someone over when he was driving home while still drunk the next morning.
