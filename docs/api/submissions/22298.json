He called beforehand to let me know he left his car in the office car park and was planning on sleeping in it (in the safe car park) that night to avoid spending lots of money on a taxi. At the time, neither of us knew this was illegal. I was a bit apprehensive of this idea but just told him to enjoy his night and be safe.\n\nWe both use an app called Find Friends to see where the other is (which we usually just use to make sure dinner is ready when the other comes home from work). I travel a lot with work, and am currently in a different continent to my partner. \n\nIt reached 1:30am in our home country, and I hadn't heard from my partner since he'd left work. I decided to check Find Friends and see if he'd gone to his car in his office car park.\n\nInstead, the app showed that he was on a very narrow and windy country lane, which ran parallel to a river. I kept watching for a while in the hopes that he was in a taxi, but his location remained the same. \n\nI'd tried to call and text to no response. I suffer from anxiety so at this point I'm thinking the worst (did he drunkenly drive there and crash? did he get lost? fall into the river?).\n\nThe longer I looked at the map the more I became physically sick with worry. After trying and failing to contact him and our friends (it was 2am by this point so they were asleep), I decided to call the local police station where he was and ask them to check to see if he was there and okay. \n\nA few hours later, I received a call from an officer letting me know that he had been arrested for sleeping in his car while intoxicated. He was taken to the police station and would spend the night in a cell.\n\nAt this point, despite being relieved that he was okay, I felt such an overwhelming feeling of guilt. If I hadn't intervened, he probably would've slept the night there and driven home safely in the morning. I was also confused as to how his car got there from his office, and started spiralling thinking about the consequences if he'd been drink driving. \n\nHe called this morning to let me know he had spent the night in a cell. Apparently his friend drove the car over to this little road for him, and he slept there because it was quieter than the car park. I'm still not sure why this friend didn't just drive him home instead of letting him sleep on the side of a sketchy narrow lane. \n\nThankfully all charges have been dropped, but he's angry that I got the police involved and I feel guilty for putting him through unnecessary stress. I feel like if something bad happened to him I wouldn't have been able to live with myself just ignoring the situation, but I overlooked the possibility that someone would drive his car to a different area for him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689422360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150a74r/aita_for_calling_the_police_to_check_on_my_partner/", "score": 105, "replies": ["NTA.

That's enough to get busted for DUI, in most jurisdictions.  \n\nStating charges were dropped simply states that boyfriend got lucky.

Charges were dropped so again doesn\u2019t sound like a DUI.  Sounds more like thrown in the drunk tank to sober up safely.\n\nHis actions led him there.

She should be taking away from that...\n\nThat I might be hard to reach between now and tomorrow morning sometime.\n\nCalling someone's cell phone at 1:30AM and expecting them to answer is not reasonable.  Smart phones have programmable do not disturb mode, programmable by time.  Mine goes automatically to DND an hour after bed time and comes out of DND mode an hour before I typically wake up.  So most of the time I would be asleep, nobody can reach me on my cell phone.\n\nAlso, even if the phone rings at 1:30, there is no guarantee that the phone ringing will wake you up...or that you will be motivated to answer it, if you do wake up.  So not getting an answer at 1:30 AM should not be cause for alarm,\n\nEspecially if you are expecting somebody to be drunk and sleeping it off at that time.\n\nHe DID communicate effectively.
