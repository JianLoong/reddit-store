My husband (32M) and I decided to pursue surrogacy as we were unable to conceive on our own due to medical reasons. His sister, let's call her Sarah (45F), graciously offered to be our surrogate, and we were overjoyed. She has 2 children of her own (22F) (24M) who\u2019s births went smoothly so we thought it wouldn\u2019t be a burden on her body and since she was healthy we agreed to go further with the process.\n\nFast forward to six months ago when our beautiful baby girl was born. We were beyond grateful to Sarah for her incredible gift to us, but that's when things started to get tricky. Sarah seemed to become extremely possessive of the baby, acting like she was the mother.\n\nWhenever she would come over to our home she insisted on being present for diaper changing, feeding, and naptime. At first I had no problem with this but I told her it would be better for her to rest having given birth recently. But she insisted on helping out. But then things changed, she constantly started telling me how to care for the baby as she \u2018has more experience\u2019.\n\nShe acts like she knows what's best for our child more than we do. She even started referring to the baby as \"her baby\" in front of our friends and family during family gatherings and constantly reminds them that she birthed my baby and tells people about my fertility issues saying how unfortunate it is. \n\nNaturally, this has caused tension between my husband and me. I've attempted to talk to my husband about it, and while he acknowledges that her behavior can be overbearing, he didnt want to confront her because he's afraid it will strain their relationship. He thinks we owe her too much to criticize her actions.\n\nBut despite this, I finally decided to have a conversation with Sarah about her behavior. I expressed my gratitude for her surrogacy but explained that it was causing confusion and stress for our family. I tried to explain how her actions were making me feel overwhelmed and that I wanted to establish boundaries as it\u2019s MY baby. She became emotional and accused me of not appreciating everything she had done for us, reminding me that she was the reason we had a child in the first place. she said i was not understanding the bond she had developed with the baby during pregnancy.\n\nAfter the argument I noticed how some of my husbands side of the family started treating me differently and looked at me differently. I feel so stressed and don\u2019t know what to do.", "created_utc": 1695203457, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nh625/aita_for_confronting_my_29f_sisterinlaw_45f_for/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a complex situation. Surrogacy had it pros and cons. Your sister in law went thru and pregnancy and gave birth to a child. I think counseling would have beneficial before you all made this decision.\n\nYou need to consult someone when specializes in these matters. On the other hand, mothers can be annoying as heck when you are the mother of a newborn. They all know better and despite not knowing your baby, you need to X when they cry and according to all my friends my well feed babies were crying because they were hungry. No, it was because my dumb butt ate coleslaw at a picnic. He's not hungry, he's gassy and mad. Rookie mistake.", "NTA - Sarah is having trouble adjusting to the reality of the situation.  She needed a little help contextualizing before the problem became bigger.", "NTA. Insisting on being present for diaper changing, feeding and nap time.   That\u2019s a newborns entire existence.  Did she literally come over and stay every day all day?  That should have been put a stop to immediately.   Calling the baby HER baby in front of friends and family is a step WAY too far.   I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s going through some sort of empty nest thing as her kids are grown combined with some post partum mild psychosis or something.   Your husband needs to step up.   There\u2019s a fine line between being grateful and appreciative about what she did for you, and allowing your entire lives to be upended by her over it.", "NTA. I can understand how Sarah feels bonded to the baby but ultimately it is your child and you have final say in how baby is cared for. I would start putting some firm boundaries down before it gets out of hand. You and your hubby need to be a team here. Yes she did a kind thing for you, but that doesn't mean she gets to hold it over your head forever.", "NTA. You all need to get this sorted before the child gets older as this could be very confusing if it continues this way. Perhaps surrogacy counselling for you all to talk through feelings and boundaries. You and your husband need to be on the same page as a priority. Sorry to give another parenting tip but it\u2019s really key imo.", "INFO:\nDid you do traditional surrogacy or gestational surrogacy?\nDid you take all the proper steps like medical and psychological evaluation prior to the pregnancy?", "NTA. \n\nI think you and your husband should consider seeing a therapist, even if just for 1-2 sessions. \n\nSurrogacy is tough on everyone- but a great thing!- and you owe Sarah your gratitude for what she did for you, but that doesn't mean you don't get to set boundaries. To me it seems like 3 things are happening at once- Sarah has a bond with this child, which is understandable, you are a little insecure since you didn't birth this child and likely worry about your own bond, and Sarah is already a parent so has some advice to give which isn't always welcome (like with many first time parents). \n\nWhat is definitely inappropriate is her calling the baby \"her baby\" and coming over and inserting herself without you asking for her help. I think your husband needs to understand your point of view and the both of you need  a safe space to talk about the complexities of your family dynamic and to build tools to move forward. \n\nIn the meantime, take a step back from Sarah and the rest of his family. You don't need people over everyday, you don't need to be at every gathering, so start saying you are busy, lock the door and don't answer for guests, and give yourself some space.", "INFO: Is the baby yours biologically and she carried it or is it hers biologically? \n\nI'm tempted to say NAH for now, I can imagine it must feel so weird to her having carried the baby for 9 months and then having to just hand her over. She will always have a strong bond with her but obviously she's massively over stepping now", "NTA\n\nNot easy but if you didnt do it things will only get worse.\n\nPrepare for hard times, SIL will not stop.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA,\n\nTherapy must be done and now, and not just her, but both your husband and yourself.  It sounds as though your husband is almost treating this child as his niece rather than daughter, by his lack of empathy.", "Uuh, so, she birthed her own brothers baby? \n\nAnd no one felt that this would be super weird?\n\nSurrogacy is complicated. The idea that it could be anything but is ludicrous. This is a woman you cannot simply ignore by leaving the country. \n\nNTA, but this issue needs work, lots of it!", "NTA. I would recommend no contact with the child until SIL gets into therapy to address the inappropriate bond she has with the child. A surrogacy is a business transaction, there should be no \"feelings\" involved.", "I would go with NAH. You are in the right to want to establish boundaries. It is your baby and you are it's mother.\n\nI would probably say Sarah wasn't expecting just how attached she would become and how difficult handing your baby over to you would be and she doesn't seem to be handling it well.\n\nI'd say Sarah needs therapy. As long as she's willing to accept help and work on this, please be understanding of the big adjustment she is making. This probably wasn't the intended outcome.\n\nI wish you both good luck and congratulations on your baby!", "Nta", "NTA - your husband needs a spine and to standup for your family. \n\nAgree with what others are saying and will add Two things: \n- if you don\u2019t have a contract with her, consult a lawyer (maybe don\u2019t tell your husband just yet if he\u2019ll be unsupportive). Ask the lawyers what claims she could exercise and how to prevent it \n- go NC with her and LC with husbands family. You and your baby need some distance from her.", "ESH.\n\n>I am in a complex situation that I never thought I'd find myself in. \n\nI strongly suggest that you outsource the task of thinking if you're this bad at it. You thought that the psychological bond between Sarah and the child would just disappear the moment she handed the child over, a child she could never forget because it would always be in her life? There are people who have made this work yes, doesn't change the fact that you were playing a very delicate and dangerous game. All three of you are irresponsible idiots.", "In this situation, you are not the asshole (NTA) for wanting to establish boundaries with your sister-in-law regarding her behavior with your baby. It's entirely reasonable for you to express your concerns and feelings, especially when her actions are making you feel overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nHowever, it's important to approach this situation delicately. It's clear that your sister-in-law is emotionally attached to the baby due to her role as a surrogate, and this may require some empathy and understanding from your end. You can acknowledge her incredible gift and the bond she developed during pregnancy while still setting boundaries that make you comfortable as the baby's parents.\n\nTry to have a calm and open conversation with your husband about how her behavior is affecting you and your relationship. It's important for both of you to be on the same page when addressing this issue. Additionally, you can consider involving a family therapist or counselor to help mediate the conversation and find a resolution that respects everyone's feelings and boundaries.", "YTA.  You broke the #1rule of surrogacy. Never ask family ir friends to do it. You should have all went through counseling. Your SIL isn't handing the emotions well. She feels like you took her baby. Maybe you should go low contact while SIL gets some councrling.", "ESH - you have a husband problem. why were things regarding the baby not made clear from the beginning? is there a contract?", "ESH, in my country she would be the legal parent and I understand why we have those laws.

And as the top commentator said that this is a delicate situation but I would like to say that you asked your sister-in-law for help and she graciously said yes.\n\nHonestly Opie at the end of the day it is still your child because she became a surrogate and though she birth the child it is still your child and you are taking care of the child you should tell your sister-in-law to step back and whether she becomes emotional or not it's just a reminder that yes she birth the child but you are the mother and you, your husband and sister-in-law knew the ramifications of the whole deal. \n\nNone  should wave the whole flag of being 'grateful' for a favor they did because yes you're grateful for what she did and you must have taken good care of her and helped her through the whole ordeal but what she's doing is stepping out of bounds and telling people about your fertility problems is a no no. \n\nThe matter of that should already be going with no contact with her and the family. On the matter of your husband and his dismissiveness I think you should remind him that at the end of day the child was of you and him and though sister helped to bring along the child, him being the husband should remember that he has a family to take care of and if he's worried about straining his other family; then he should step back and decide to give child support. \n\nI'm not honestly saying that Opie should divorce her husband I am more saying that you should talk to your husband and lay the groundwork and also give the idea of counseling to understand where to go from this because right now there's a child involved and the more bickering that is present the more unstable the life of the child will be. \n\nAll I'm saying Opie is that MTA and you should really get your boundaries across because this will all come back to mess up the child if it doesn't get straightened up", "Surrogacy is complicated.
