Did she literally come over and stay every day all day?  That should have been put a stop to immediately.   Calling the baby HER baby in front of friends and family is a step WAY too far.   I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s going through some sort of empty nest thing as her kids are grown combined with some post partum mild psychosis or something.   Your husband needs to step up.   There\u2019s a fine line between being grateful and appreciative about what she did for you, and allowing your entire lives to be upended by her over it.", "NTA.

To me it seems like 3 things are happening at once- Sarah has a bond with this child, which is understandable, you are a little insecure since you didn't birth this child and likely worry about your own bond, and Sarah is already a parent so has some advice to give which isn't always welcome (like with many first time parents). \n\nWhat is definitely inappropriate is her calling the baby \"her baby\" and coming over and inserting herself without you asking for her help. I think your husband needs to understand your point of view and the both of you need  a safe space to talk about the complexities of your family dynamic and to build tools to move forward. \n\nIn the meantime, take a step back from Sarah and the rest of his family.

On the matter of your husband and his dismissiveness I think you should remind him that at the end of day the child was of you and him and though sister helped to bring along the child, him being the husband should remember that he has a family to take care of and if he's worried about straining his other family; then he should step back and decide to give child support. \n\nI'm not honestly saying that Opie should divorce her husband I am more saying that you should talk to your husband and lay the groundwork and also give the idea of counseling to understand where to go from this because right now there's a child involved and the more bickering that is present the more unstable the life of the child will be. \n\nAll I'm saying Opie is that MTA and you should really get your boundaries across because this will all come back to mess up the child if it doesn't get straightened up", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Prior to the argument she\u2019d come over whilst my husband was at work to help and first I had no problem with it and I was happy that she was offering to help and given that this is my first baby I took any advice and help but after a while it just felt a bit much. \n\nMy husband hasn\u2019t said much else about it.", "IVF surrogacy, so my eggs and husbands sperm. prior to the pregnancy myself, husband and SIL were spoken to and evaluated by a licensed psychologist. but no counselling took place after birth, we offered to pay for any treatments she required after the birth. i think she may be experiencing some kind of post partum stress but now that we\u2019re not speaking i\u2019m not sure how to offer counselling support to her.

I understand that Sarah might have formed an attachment to the baby, it's natural when you have a baby growing in your belly. However, she has to put a control over herself now because she was a surrogate.\n\nAnother thing I would like to point is that I don't think she will ever not see your daughter as her own. And when your daughter grows up a bit and starts to understand stuff, Sarah might even tell her that you are not her real mother and she is. While, this is just hypothetical and might be a stretch, it's still a possibility.\n\nDid you guys had a contract for surrogacy or some sort of agreement? Also, all of you should get therapy. Your husband also needs to step up in making some strict boundaries with his sister. My advice would be for you to move far away from Sarah and your in-laws, perhaps in another state. It's not ideal but it will be best for your future and having some distance might also help Sarah to be less attached to your daughter over time. NTA", "NTA. On the one hand I can sympathize with your SIL because I\u2019m sure her emotions/hormones are all over the place and adjusting to the reality of the situation is probably hard for her, but at this point she is starting to stomp boundaries and becoming overbearing. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH, but I do think she needs some therapy and support so she can start looking at the situation healthier and become more capable of respecting your boundaries without letting it hurt her. \n\nI would have voted NAH, but I think your husband is an AH for not doing more to help work through this issue just because he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. He needs to grow a backbone and be more supportive of your feelings. That doesn\u2019t mean he has to fight and argue with his family, but it does mean he needs to stand as a united front with you instead of trying to stay out of it so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with any uncomfortable conversations and leave you to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d and \u201cunappreciative\u201d one. Also, if his family is developing a negative view of you because of any of this (as you said you are starting to sense), it is HIS responsibility to defend you and prevent that from getting worse. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask or pressure him into it, it should be automatic.", "NTA. Something had to be said. It's clear your sister is having a hard time accepting that this baby she gave birth to is not actually her baby, and it's wrong for her to constantly refer to your fertility issues and try to make you feel ashamed or small for that. Even though it must have been incredibly uncomfortable, you were definitely right to say something to her and establish those boundaries.\n\nYour SIL did a wonderful and generous thing by being your surrogate, but it sounds like she didn't think through what it would be like to carry someone else's child (especially a child that she's related to and will know for the rest of her life) to term in her body and then give that baby to its parents--especially considering she has two children of her own and her experience in the past has been that after 9 months of pregnancy and then giving birth, that bond means \"mother and child\" and not \"aunt and niece.\"\n\nIf you have another baby by surrogacy, consider hiring a surrogate instead if it's financially feasible. A lot of parents form great bonds with their surrogate and have really wonderful, positive experiences without these kinds of complications. I hope your SIL gets herself into therapy really soon.", "INFO: did you do the surrogacy through the legal system?", "NTA\n\n> she said i was not understanding the bond she had developed with the baby during pregnancy\n\nShe is massively overstepping and needs counseling.\n\nIt\u2019s time for your husband to get on board with enforcing boundaries.

Tell SIL one more time you appreciate her assisting in helping your create your family but it\u2019s *your family*. Your child, she is an aunt. Not the child\u2019s mother. Also, you need to talk separately to each of the family members acting cold towards you. Explain you had a private conversation with SIL and you\u2019re not sure what she is telling people so you want to clear the air. You appreciate what SIL did for you, but as a surrogate her role was completed. She is an aunt to your child. Your family dynamic is you are the mom, husband is the father, and nothing should be confused from here on out.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nWhen SIL calls your daughter \u201cher baby\u201d that warrants a response. \u201cSIL thank you for being our gestational carrier.

ESH", "NAH, but I feel you might not have researched the realities of surrogacy enough. There's a reason the contracts have to be iron clad. One of those reasons is that during pregnancy, a woman's empathy center grows 3x it's normal size in preparation for the baby and the bond between mother and child starts forming during pregnancy. You can't really fight that or affect it.\nIt's one of the reasons if it ends up in court without an ironclad contract, and sometimes with one, custody gets awarded to the woman who carried the pregnancy, not the ones who donated the  egg cell or sperm. \n\n>But despite this, I finally decided to have a conversation with Sarah about her behavior. I expressed my gratitude for her surrogacy but explained that it was causing confusion and stress for our family. I tried to explain how her actions were making me feel overwhelmed and that I wanted to establish boundaries as it\u2019s MY baby.\n\nBut its not only your baby. Your sister's mitochondrial DNA also affected your baby's DNA. She's the one who went through the pregnancy and childbirth and took all the risks to bring that baby into the world. She's the one whose empathy center is 3 times bigger than it was. Those things aren't erasable. \n\nSurrogacy is a huge ethical concern because of things like this. Who has more right to the child? The ones who donated genetic material or the one whose body did all the work and took all the risks and became biologically attached to the child? \nAnd what about the baby? It is harmful for the child's development to be removed from the woman who carried it too early, regardless of breastfeeding or whose DNA it has more of. Women who have just given birth give off the same smell as their amniotic fluid so the baby can recognize them, (all babies are born short-sighted, they can only see from the boob to mom's face, so they need a little extra help). The woman who donated her egg cell won't smell like the baby's mom to the baby.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH.

Go on nice long walks, or meet up with friends, maybe join a mother and baby group in our area, anything to get you and baby out of the house when Sarah visits. \n\nIt sounds like Sarah needs some help, here. She's seeing the baby as her child because she carried and birthed it, but it's not her child, and she's unable to make the switch from pregnant woman to aunt.

SIL needs counseling ASAP and the family needs to step back and either look at this logically or stay out of it.  \n\nIf this was any other woman who had carried your child, no one in the family would be acting like you were wrong for wanting to establish boundaries.  They probably would be just as offended and upset as you are about a woman whose only role was to incubate and birth the child stepping in and acting like the mother.  This is one of the reasons you do not use family in such a sensitive situation, but it is understandable why it feels logical at the time as you know the person and their habits.  \n\nDo not be swayed by emotion and you need to go have it out with the husband about what is happening and how he needs to back you up.

This is really a her problem and she really needs to talk to a professional about it.

That must be hell for someone who was inadequately prepared and has no professional support. Even with extensive support and previous experience it would be challenging. You have completely neglected the aftermath of the pregnancy, hoping it would all magically work itself out, and it won't. Forgetting how her body has changed, how she would have bled for weeks and her breasts likely leaked milk afterwards, her brain chemistry changed during pregnancy and those changed remain for a very long time after birth. She can't turn it off, she can only be supported, but it sounds like none of you are doing that. Her children are adults now and likely not at home, so where can she funnel all of these instincts and feelings now?\n\nYour husband needs to pull his head out of his arse and see this for the situation it is. His sister is deeply confused and hormonal, and he's taking no responsibility. Instead, he's letting the cards fall as they may because he's not prepared to be a father, to be a brother, and to take action.\n\nI understand you thought you were doing the right thing, but trying to tackle this alone has blown up in your face, it always has to come from both of you as a united front, or from him because it's his family, you shouldn't be trying to talk to his family about massively divisive topics alone.\n\nLastly, you realise that unless this is all sorted soon, your child is going to be mercilessly teased for being the product of incest?

She is a mother instinctually and will need therapy or complete cut off contact to wean this. This is why do many surrogates are not involved right after the delivery. Some might drop off breast milk, but the more time they spend with the baby the harder it is to let go.\n\nYour husband NEEDS to get on board before your child is older. When family and friends could start saying BS like, \"Aunt Sarah is your real mom\". Or worse, Sarah says it herself. You also need to look up your state laws in surrogacy.

In addition; you may want to start looking at putting some legal things in place just so she and the rest of the family can respect the boundaries.

Demeaning you and gossiping about your inability to give birth is malicious and aimed to put you in your place. If moving is an option away from the family; or you going to stay with your side of the family is an option do that - so you can establish some real boundaries to bond with your baby properly.
