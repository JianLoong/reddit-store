This sounds like a healthy and beneficial setup for both parties. Your Aunt is making out like your parents are taking advantage of you and have no say in babysitting your siblings. You have already told her you were ok with the arrangement and your parents should have shut that down.", "NTA. You sound very mature and reasonable, unlike your aunt. \nWhen I was your age I blew up at my sister when I was super frustrated with her, and for good reason, and asked my dad for advice. The only thing he said was, \u201cThere are two ways to get your point across. One which will piss them off, and one which they will listen to.\u201d\nThat was my lesson in diplomacy I carry with me to this day. \nDad didn\u2019t tell me that I was wrong for feeling the way I felt, nor did he berate me for acting out. I think it was his way of redirecting me to tell my sister to get off my case in a way which would get my point across and leave zero room for defensiveness or retribution from her. \nIt worked well when I asked my sister for a re-do of the conversation, and when she obliged I asked her to forgive me for the blow up but to also hear me out once my anger had subsided. And she agreed to it. \nI decided to be the reasonable one, and thankfully she picked up what I was putting down. \nI hope this helps, dear one. \nPS, I bet your younger siblings absolutely adore you and wouldn\u2019t choose a babysitter over your company. \nGood luck.", "NTA and honestly you have just set a very clear boundary. I would have been mad that she didn\u2019t believe me when I said it was fine way back. She will get over it but she will watch what she says from now on. Your parents had to have a talk with you because it\u2019s their obligation because she\u2019s older and you\u2019re their daughter. It\u2019s fine. In the end everyone will get over it. Aunt will watch her tongue. If she brings it up again, you can always say \u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped at you in such a sharp way but the message still stands. Please respect me when I say it\u2019s fine\u201d", "NTA for speaking up and defending yourself, you should absolutely be able to be heard on your own life.", "everyone should mind their own business and if they don\u2019t you should tell them to shut up.", "I could understand her concerns if you were doing this every night, but once a week is more than reasonable.

There are so many parents who abuse this kind of thing that she thought you were one of those victims. She was really trying to help you and free you to live your life.\n\nThe problem is, you're actually happy with the arrangement. You didn't want her help. You didn't want her meddling with your arrangement.\n\nIt took you blowing up at her to make her realize that you truly didn't want her help.\n\nSo you're not TA for the necessary blunt talk, and she's not TA for not believing this wasn't a typical case of a child being pressured.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
