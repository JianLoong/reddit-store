She's upset that you took a gamble from your guys' joint account without her knowledge or consent. What were you going to post if you lost that money? \"AITA for calling my wife a meanie for her reaction because I gambled some money and lost it?\" You don't get to crow that you're in the right just because you won this time - that doesn't change the fact that you still took that money.

Goes without saying taking money from a joint account for sports betting and not telling your wife why until she asked about is an AH move. As written, this is an absolutely massive overreaction, so if this is portrayed faithfully then ESH. However, 100 dollars isn't a ton of money for you guys, but you put 100 dollars down on one 90-1 parlay. You'd be the only gambler I know who puts down one solitary mega longshot parlay and calls it a week, so I find it very unlikely that was your only bet this week. That's a very large betting amount for a moon shot that you were fortunate enough to hit as you do that bet fully expecting to torch 100 bucks and hope you get super lucky, which you did. If you do genuinely believe you made that 9k because you're a sports betting maestro then yes you do have a problem.", "NTA.\n\nBut I do think you and your wife need to establish better communication and boundaries around gambling.

I\u2019d be livid.", "OP said in another comment that all up he's ahead by $2000. That means he was down $7000 and then took another $100 out of their joint account and is now acting like his wife is being irrational for being furious he continued to bet their because he won this time and that was supposed to make it all okay.", "Says the person who keeps gambling even tho they are \u201cgood\u201d at it but previously lost 7k\u2026..okay", "Says every addict", "Then explain how you lost 7k in one go round???", "That\u2019s great, but you do know that puts you in the top I guess 0,1 percent, right? If that is true, there\u2019s no reason she should have a problem with it. Still: Her point is valid", "Wow. OP lost 7k gambling? 10% of his income lost to gambling. No wonder his wife was angry.", "That did not help his case at all either lol", "Oh yeah. You need serious help. You both are only making 75 a year and you lost 7k in one go once?

Continuously nagging in order to receive expensive gifts for oneself is off putting...no matter what the circumstance is. This is what gives women a bad rep when you can \"buy their silence\" with expensive gifts imho...\n\nIf she's holding onto it for mortgage and bills so that he doesn't squander it away, then she really deserves respect. She deserves better than this.", "Assuming his income was also in joint account\u2026 OP said $100 isn\u2019t a big deal for them, so why the need for her permission? \nI don\u2019t buy his \u201cI forgot I won $9000 last week\u201d though.", "Exploding over $100 when they collectively make more than $148,000 seems incredibly silly.

She's not financially abusing him.", "Oh my naive sweet summer child\u2026..\n\nEdit-You also failed to mention how you lost 7k in 1 go round.  So since you were previously in the negatives is it safe to say you weren\u2019t very good then??", "Genuinely I say this from a concerned outsider perspective, if you think you\u2019re \u201cgood\u201d at gambling that\u2019s already a lie you\u2019re telling yourself to justify the behavior. \n\nGambling is sheer luck and odds, that\u2019s it. You cannot possibly be good at something you cannot possibly control. You can have good odds, and you can have prior knowledge, but at the end of the day it\u2019s sheer luck. The dollar amount is not the problem, it\u2019s the repetition compulsion and belief that you can beat the system. You can\u2019t. \n\nTake one look at the glamour of Las Vegas. Absolutely none of that would be possible if everyone won, and if you ask gamblers, everyone in Vegas considers themselves a good gambler. \n\nThe one game people can get good at with a discernible skill is blackjack, and guess what. \n\nThat\u2019s just luck and odds too. \n\nI know a card counter who had a +40 deck and people left and right of him were getting 21s but he lost over $3500 in a night believing the next one would hit for him. It never did.\n\nThe house can lose all day and make it up tomorrow, but the house only has to get you to zero once to ruin your life.", "Imma need a full profit/loss statement to validate this claim.

Ouch", "Why is the assumption that he routinely takes money for gambling?", "Is the assumption she asks for permission for everything she spends?", "Yeah, I got this feeling as well. \n\nI had a co-worker brag about winning $500 on a scratch-off. Okay, cool but he still owed my other co-worker $3500 because he went on a work trip, blew his money on slots and strippers, and didn't have enough to pay his kids' daycare bill and car note.", "He said though that he makes over 75k, he also wins some. I stated that he should have told his wife, I don\u2019t think its right, he didn\u2019t tell her. But I also won\u2019t defend his wife exploding on him over $100.

Then there isn\u2019t a joint account to fight about and the bills still get paid.", "Agree to disagree. I personally believe it was wrong to not tell her, I also think it was wrong of her to blow up on him over $100 that ended up becoming 9k.", "Except his losses have come out of his personal account, not the joint account. This seems to be the first time he took out of the joint account, meaning he hasn\u2019t lost any of her money. Edit: Also the fact she calmed down when he gave her 2/3 of the winnings as spending cash, not joint account cash, is why I said ESH.

You were 7k down when you took this money to bet with", "Has he lost more than 75k which is what his salary is or higher? Also that couldn\u2019t possibly be true because otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have separate pools of cash to begin with and makes her even more unreasonable in my eyes."]}
