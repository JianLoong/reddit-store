For months I've talking and meet-up with different artists until I found one I liked and trusted. While I was doing this a friend of mine told me that his wife did tattoos. I was interested in the work so I asked to see the portfolio. If I'm being honest the work isnt....great. so I politely told him that it's not really my style but thank you for telling me about her. Now on to the problem. That conversation happened in January. And every single time i see him he goes, \"did you get the tattoo yet? If not you should let my wife do it\" and every time I would say, \"no thank you. I found an artist I like and trust\" and he would glare at me.\n\nThen one time I ran into his wife and she asked me about the tattoo. I told her I haven't gotten it yet. Then she would go on about how she can do a much better job and she wouldn't charge me as much.\nI told her the same thing I've been telling her husband, that I found an artist I really like and she goes, \"well I have an artist I love and trust too. But I give other artists a chance too\" \nI kinda got frustrated and just walked away.\nShe overhead me talking about taking my niece out to get her eyebrow pierced. And she jumped in praising her piercing abilities and shows off her own ear piercing that looked like it was on the verge of falling out of her ear. I said I'd think about it and she finally stopped asking...for that day. \n\nI'm so tired of hearing how good she is from both of them almost everyday. Why can't they take no for an answer? Am I the only one in the damn universe that wants a tattoo right now?!\nPlease help! I don't want to be mean to them but I also want them to stop asking me.\n\nI think I maybe be the asshole cause I've just been beating around the bush instead of just saying I don't want work by her.", "created_utc": 1701361545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187min7/wibta_if_i_told_a_tattoo_artist_their_tattoos_are/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is she health certified? If she's not. I'd say I prefer someone who has a shop etc that if something went wrong they would be liable and you would be compensated.\n\nOP I had a friend who did tattoo work in her home and she wasn't awful but wasn't good. So I get you. She would always show me her work and I could never give an honest opinion. I used to wonder how people ended up with bad tattoos.. now I know", "NTA - you've been nice, now it's time to be clear - \"I do not care for the work in your portfolio and I am not interested in your services\"  if you want to be very honest \"I am not interested in your services, I find your work and business practices to be unprofessional and will not use them nor will I recommend your services to others.\"\n\nIf that's enough to ruin the friendship, they were not friends with you for any other reason other than a possible business transaction.\n\neta; changed wording", "NTA- apparently subtly is lost on these people. You tried to be nice and let her down easy but if they bring it up again your going to have to be blunt with her and tell her how you really feel or it'll never end.", "NTA but you don't need to give your opinion beyond saying that their style isn't for you. You can tell them straight up to please not bring the topic up again as you won't be changing your mind and you don't want things to get awkward.\n\nYou may have to resort to saying \"Look, I don't know how many times I can politely say no. Can you *please* take no for an answer so I don't have to be any more blunt than this.\"\n\nSaying \"The answer is still no. It will always be no. *No!*\" Is better than saying their work is awful, as you don't need to resort to a low blow to hurt their feelings. You just need to firmly refuse.", "How about you just be honest and tell her you don't particularly care her work so you won't ever be using her? You keep trying to be nice, that doesn't work with some people, so just be honest and up front so they'll quit thinking she's got a shot at doing it? NTA but seriously, straighten your damn spine and just tell them, sheesh.", "NTA but I'm cautiously hopeful that there may still be better ways of dealing with the situation than insults. I know you've said this has been going on for a long time and they do seem pretty oblivious, but finding an airtight excuse seems like it could have some effect. If they're even somewhat reasonable, they won't argue with the logic of \"Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable with getting a home tattoo, I'd much rather go through a professional businessfront\" or something to that extent.\n\nIf they continue to press the point after that, *then* I think it's time to be honest with them by letting them know that they've both been quite pushy and it's made you quite uncomfortable, and that, while you had made an effort to let her down nicely, you frankly aren't interested in her work. If you care about preserving your relationship with these people, then there's no need to tell her it's ugly or bad if you can help it\u2014 stating you aren't interested, and that you don't \u2013like\u2013 her work, don't feel comfortable with her setup, and that you've already made an appointment with someone else should (hopefully) be enough, rather outright than insulting her work or giving her the hard truth.\n\nBut it's ultimately up to you whether or not you feel you need to break your honest opinion to her. Just know it might cost you some friendship with them. I also give her the benefit of hoping she might become better in time... but that's only if she gets a proper apprenticeship. Tattooing & piercing aren't really things someone should expect to be treated professionally about if they haven't had professional training. Not everyone is down to pay a random person money to permanently modify their body.", "NTA and her attitude is enough to not book an appointment with her", "I think you should double down on your style isn\u2019t my style. And if they keep up, then say, you would never work with an artist that doesn\u2019t understand or respect there are different styles.  Also you wouldn\u2019t trust a memorial to a new artist, that\u2019s mot where you f around \n\nThat\u2019s she bad at this point isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s the pushing and that deserves clap back.", "NTA, and I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about accidentally insulting her. I mean, she seems super dense and unprofessional for pestering you when you\u2019ve said no thanks. Sounds like she\u2019s desperate for some work and no wonder cos apparently she is shit.", "Tell her you have a booking and have paid your deposit for a few month down the line it will give you some time to sort it and shut them up at the same time.", "NTA\n\nBut stop engaging with them at all.\n\nYou have stated your preference. \n\nNo need to even answer anymore.\n\nJust walk away.", "NTA\n\nI would not converse about this with them any further. If they continue to ask, develop a canned response: \u201cI\u2019ve already answered that.\u201d", "NTA for sticking to what you want to do, your body, your choice.  \n\n\nThe fact they're being so pushy about it is so annoying and makes them the A H  \n\n\nI suggest trying to shut it down once and for all by saying that you don't do business with friends or their families in case it turns out badly, it's one thing if you have a problem with a business, it's another when it's friends involved, because now there are feelings involved.   \n\n\nThis works for me because I actually follow this principle, I would never hire a friend's brother to do some work at my house, for example, because it could go sideways. This won't work for you if you actually have a history of paying friends/their families to do work for you.", "Post her work on r/shittytattoos, let them decide.
