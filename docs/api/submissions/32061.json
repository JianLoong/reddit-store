I was interested in the work so I asked to see the portfolio. If I'm being honest the work isnt....great. so I politely told him that it's not really my style but thank you for telling me about her. Now on to the problem. That conversation happened in January. And every single time i see him he goes, \"did you get the tattoo yet? If not you should let my wife do it\" and every time I would say, \"no thank you. I found an artist I like and trust\" and he would glare at me.\n\nThen one time I ran into his wife and she asked me about the tattoo. I told her I haven't gotten it yet. Then she would go on about how she can do a much better job and she wouldn't charge me as much.\nI told her the same thing I've been telling her husband, that I found an artist I really like and she goes, \"well I have an artist I love and trust too. But I give other artists a chance too\" \nI kinda got frustrated and just walked away.\nShe overhead me talking about taking my niece out to get her eyebrow pierced. And she jumped in praising her piercing abilities and shows off her own ear piercing that looked like it was on the verge of falling out of her ear. I said I'd think about it and she finally stopped asking...for that day. \n\nI'm so tired of hearing how good she is from both of them almost everyday. Why can't they take no for an answer? Am I the only one in the damn universe that wants a tattoo right now?!\nPlease help! I don't want to be mean to them but I also want them to stop asking me.\n\nI think I maybe be the asshole cause I've just been beating around the bush instead of just saying I don't want work by her.\n\nEDIT 1: thank you everyone so much for all the advice and coaching me on what to say to them.. i have an appointment to get my tattoo tomorrow ill update you guys if anything happens when my friend sees in.", "created_utc": 1701361545, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187min7/wibta_if_i_told_a_tattoo_artist_their_tattoos_are/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd say I prefer someone who has a shop etc that if something went wrong they would be liable and you would be compensated.\n\nOP I had a friend who did tattoo work in her home and she wasn't awful but wasn't good. So I get you. She would always show me her work and I could never give an honest opinion.

You can tell them straight up to please not bring the topic up again as you won't be changing your mind and you don't want things to get awkward.\n\nYou may have to resort to saying \"Look, I don't know how many times I can politely say no. Can you *please* take no for an answer so I don't have to be any more blunt than this.\"\n\nSaying \"The answer is still no. It will always be no. *No!*\" Is better than saying their work is awful, as you don't need to resort to a low blow to hurt their feelings. You just need to firmly refuse.", "How about you just be honest and tell her you don't particularly care her work so you won't ever be using her? You keep trying to be nice, that doesn't work with some people, so just be honest and up front so they'll quit thinking she's got a shot at doing it? NTA but seriously, straighten your damn spine and just tell them, sheesh.", "NTA but I'm cautiously hopeful that there may still be better ways of dealing with the situation than insults. I know you've said this has been going on for a long time and they do seem pretty oblivious, but finding an airtight excuse seems like it could have some effect. If they're even somewhat reasonable, they won't argue with the logic of \"Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable with getting a home tattoo, I'd much rather go through a professional businessfront\" or something to that extent.\n\nIf they continue to press the point after that, *then* I think it's time to be honest with them by letting them know that they've both been quite pushy and it's made you quite uncomfortable, and that, while you had made an effort to let her down nicely, you frankly aren't interested in her work. If you care about preserving your relationship with these people, then there's no need to tell her it's ugly or bad if you can help it\u2014 stating you aren't interested, and that you don't \u2013like\u2013 her work, don't feel comfortable with her setup, and that you've already made an appointment with someone else should (hopefully) be enough, rather outright than insulting her work or giving her the hard truth.\n\nBut it's ultimately up to you whether or not you feel you need to break your honest opinion to her. Just know it might cost you some friendship with them. I also give her the benefit of hoping she might become better in time... but that's only if she gets a proper apprenticeship. Tattooing & piercing aren't really things someone should expect to be treated professionally about if they haven't had professional training.
