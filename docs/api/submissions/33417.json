And then stop. If she wants to keep playing, and her set up isn't in your bedroom, then after the battle that ends closest to 23:00; log out, start your bedtime routine and then go to bed. She can continue playing but you are not required to.\n\nIf she complains it isn't late yet, tell her it's late *for you* and that gaming isn't fun when you're tired.\n\nThis is an amazing low-stakes opportunity to practice stating and upholding a personal boundary (going to bed at an appropriate time) when your loved one would prefer you didn't. It's uncomfortable but it's such an important skill to have.

This sounds like the exact kind of all-around teenage pettiness you expect from 18-19 year olds in college/high school relationships. Your girlfriend sounds incredibly immature and seems to have trouble regulating her emotions. Frankly, you need to grow up and get better standards for yourself and your love life. Wanting to be in bed at a reasonable time is the only part of this anecdote that's relevant at all - being anal and obsessive about ending on a win or a loss is incredibly petty. It sounds like she refuses to stop during a winstreak (\"strike while the iron's hot\", \"it's not even late yet\"), refuses to stop during a losing streak (\"it feels bad\"), and refuses to listen to you when you try to wake her up to the reality of having to be up and functional in the morning. All in all, it just sounds like a roundabout way of justifying a gaming addiction from someone who's emotionally crippled and easily manipulated by empty dopamine rushes.", "NTA but have you tried talking about it?", "NTA. But really you're both yta for still playing that trash.", "Well good consequence but for the wrong reason imo. She sounds kinda addicted and the two of you even start fighting over a video game, resulting in not talking with each other. This doesn\u2019t sound right to me and I can imagine that there may be some underlying issues that are unrelated to the game itself but within your relationship. \nThis is only my take on it all and I could be wrong with that advice but the both of you should play a little less on the pc/console and spend your time with something else that the both of you could really like\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffbespecially since you don\u2019t see each other so much (as I\u2019ve understood).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead he takes off like a shot going as fast as he can. I explain my real purpose and he says stuff like \"we can do that at home.\" Oh please.  It has been like this, I won't play tennis, golf, volleyball, softball, or even damned croquet with this guy. So I don't, I play with other friends or do other activities.\n\nIt makes me very sad.
