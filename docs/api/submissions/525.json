She followed me out of nowhere and asked her \u201cdo I know you\u201d? And she said she was an acquaintance from high school, and how she changed her name, because her name shared the same name as a terrorist organization (isis) and she was bullied for it, and I remember we both empathized with each other. \n\nWhat she changed her name to? Well let\u2019s call her Candace for protection. Well when she messaged me we instantly bonded over our love of cartoons and movies, and how we both infodumped about it. Now another thing about me too, I can be very naive and gullible. Since she was bullied for her name and been through hell, I empathized with her. Didn\u2019t help either she was 4\u20198. So she tells me how her bf at the time who we will call Devon for protection, that he was abusive, and I was downright shocked and depressed that he would turn into that, as she really convinced me.\n\nThen a few months later one of my best friends tells me about how she is faking abuse and does stuff for clout \u2014 and initially I didn\u2019t believe my friend. One thing too I always prefer face time calls or voice messages because texting is hard because I struggle with reading comprehension. Then back in June she asks me to buy her food and I can\u2019t, because I was broke at the time and working, and stressed.\n\nI also know too again texting is hard, so she said when I called her \u201cphone calls are draining\u201d. I also heard around the time too she kicked 3 people out of her apartment she was living with the time for various reasons and it was ableist bc all of them are neurodivergent! \n\nShe also used me for clout too. Where she made me switch my Instagram from private to public just so she gets more followers (since I have close to 1000, she has less than 200). She also when we hung out one time rubbed my back in a pretty inappropriate way, which made me feel rightfully uncomfortable, but I asked her (concerningly) if she \u201cdoes this with most of her close friends\u201d and she said in a weird way \u201conly some\u201d. Yet the thing is I wasn\u2019t interested in her, only wanted friends, fyi I am gay.\n\nAnyways back to the June bit I attended a birthday party of a friend, and since Candace hates my close friend since I posted a pic with her, she blocks me. And now a lot of people probably hate me because of her. I never even did anything. I also know she wanted me to tell Devon messed up things which obviously I didn\u2019t want to because I still thought highly of him. I even told Candace to not tell him I am friends with her but didn\u2019t listen. He even unfollowed me and that pissed me OFF.\n\nI am still feeling very confused by all this.

Candace doesn't get to tell you what you do with your social media or who you can be friends with.  She may be neurodivergent, but neurodivergent people can still have toxic/manipulative traits if they grew up in an environment that rewarded it, and it sounds like Candace is using a lot of people and creating a lot of drama where there doesn't need to be.\n\nIt's still also possible she really was abused by Devon (even toxic people can be victims of abuse), so you can consider different things she has said or done on their own merits, but it does sound like a good idea to protect yourself from her and the behaviors she's doing that are hurting you, separate from making judgments about her claims of abuse.  \n\nI can't tell you whether Devon is an abuser or not, but it is a good idea to see if you can learn what behaviors she considers to be abusive from him to see if it lines up with your experience of how he treats people or keep an eye out for it.  If you start hearing similar reports from people other than Candace, or seeing what she is saying for yourself, then you definitely want to take a hard look at him.\n\nThis is a really complex situation, though, and I'm sorry you're being put in the middle of it.", "I can't even understand this well enough to judge. What the heck is going on here?", "Wow. This is a mess. This sounds really manipulative of her and you let her despite the red flags.

Yes often ND people are prone to abuse, so much so that it\u2019s often considered love, which is fucked up. Often 9 times out of 10 we are mistreated and go through ABA therapy, which is mental and emotional abuse against autistic people and makes us feel bad and have identify crises. It\u2019s literally the residential schools for autistics, as our special interests get taken away from us or only getting an interest or item as a reward. So 9 times out of 10 often we are abused and often when we do questionable things we don\u2019t mean them. Yes though you have a point where some ND people are in enviornments that raise them to be asshats, especially parents of police officers, popular people or sluts (moms who sleep with a lot of people).\n\nShe would tell him he wasn\u2019t good enough and often Devon had to defend himself, and would often belittle him and put him down, and would often send him death threats after they broke up and she was being manipulative towards her. She would even make fake accounts on instagram to stalk him too. She also made a bunch of false r*pe allegations against him, her other exes and even her bloody UNCLE. If that\u2019s not fucked idk what is lmao.", "I know, it\u2019s very fucked up, even I don\u2019t get it. She is confusing as hell!", "Called me out here ahahaha. I am 23. I\u2019m just worried she will spread rumours about me because where I am from, which was a small town everyone there acts like they are in high school.", "Yeah definitely sounds like make some distance from Candace.\n\n(Nothing wrong with popular people or sluts, though, as long as they otherwise provide a solid emotional upbringing, like their kids shouldn't be super aware of their adult activities)", "you are being made fun of", "that sounds tiresome LOL.  \nFor some background- I'm 51 and when I first got on social media about 11 years ago,  everyone I knew (or should I say who knew ME) sent me friend requests and I figured \"why not?\". Lemme tell you, that high school mentality extends well into middle age for a lot of people. I had to block everyone who knew who I was when I was young after about a year because of all the childish rumors and nonsense that was interfering with my life. Now, of all my friends on all social media platforms, maybe 2 of them actually know me in person.  I'm not even friends with ANY of my family. They know how to reach me if they need to.   \nCut all that shit out of your life as soon as possible. You don't need it, especially considering what you deal with internally (I'm bipolar and have a myriad of chronic conditions, so I can relate a little). You don't owe anyone anything, including your online presence.", "How so", "IOW, anyone who makes you question yourself or defend yourself doesn't need to be a part of your life, at least online. That's not friendship and it's not healthy for YOU", "I\u2019m trying. Where I am from, it\u2019s called Sault Ste. Marie Ontario, it\u2019s small and very authority based, where only police officers, government officials, popular people, rich people, children related to any of the above, kids related to staff members of the city\u2019s school district like principal or executive, or people who play rep league hockey get away with things and if you\u2019re not one of them you\u2019re pretty much eaten alive unless you threatened someone (this is true). It also doesn\u2019t help either its EXTREMELY right wing. I cannot tell you how many times I\u2019ve hissed and barked angrily at boomers for when they stare at me stimming or making certain arm/facial movements I can\u2019t help.", "Yep, a lot of people where I am from did that, they made me have an identity crisis as early as AGE SIX. And I don\u2019t like screaming or yelling at people, but a lot of people from your generation are absolutely ableist and seem to have vendettas against the mentally ill, probably because of how in the 70s you would have been sent to a mental hospital or an internment camp. Even TALKING about it was taboo back then. I am trying to find a place in Toronto or something so I can find myself for a little bit.", "dang. That sounds HORRIFIC! How soon can you get the fuck outta there?  In the meantime, maybe just cut everyone off cold turkey? It's hard at first, but it's worth your sanity in the end. Are you able to do that?", "my parents found out I was bipolar in 75 (I was 4). Not much was known about it at the time and yeah- there was a HUGE stigma about it. They chose not to even try to help me because doing so would be an admission that I was \"flawed\", so I basically went through my early years not knowing what was wrong with me and failing at everything. There's no telling how much I could have accomplished if they had addressed it when I was young. I had to find out for myself when I was 21 because  I felt like a freak and wanted to know WHY.  I was shocked, so I asked my parents if they had any suspicions and they said \"yeah, we've known since you were 4\" like it was NO BIG DEAL. They even tried to marry me off to a 22 year old when I was 14 just to get rid of me rather than take me to a psyche doc.   \nI've never let them live that down.   \nI can't believe in this day and age that there is still so much stigma attached to these illnesses.   \nAll I can really say is try to become as self-sufficient as possible.   \nI'm so sorry for what you're going through. Truly.", "I honestly feel the Alfred Hitchcock movie \u201cPsycho\u201d was responsible for the mistreatment of the mentally ill. Since norman bates CLEARLY has DID (dissociative identify disorder) which there are many people with DID who have good hearts and they made THAT the villain. I also feel it scared a lot of conservatives into doubling down on mistreating us, and they probably felt anyone with an OUNCE of mental illness back then was Norman fucking Bates to them. That movie, if it came out nowadays, would be absolutely critically panned. And back then they thought EVERY mental disorder under the sun even Autism, BPD, OCD & DID was schizophrenia. And a lot of autistic and mentally people back then were poisoned, tied to beds in institutions and basically tortured them. The conservatives really make us out to be monsters, when in actuality it\u2019s THEM who are the monsters. When can Autistic ppl and the mentally ill get OUR BLM treatment, OUR CNN treatment? The narrative has to change.", "agreed. It's not a choice and it isn't fun."]}
