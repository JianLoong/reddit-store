We are both kind of messy people so to alleviate this, we set some boundaries about cleaning common areas so we both don\u2019t get overwhelmed. One of these boundaries is that dirty dishes have to be cleaned within a week of them being in the sink. Sometimes, especially if we get depressed, we have to be reminded of this boundary for one another or will do the dishes to help each other out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, I was out of town for a week with my partner and when I left she had a few dishes in the sink and a pizza box on our coffee table. I asked her if she could have things cleaned up by the time I got back from the trip since she wasn\u2019t leaving. She agreed and apologized for the mess.  When I got back I was pretty exhausted from driving and camping for several days. When I opened the door to my apartment I was shocked to find it worse off than I left it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeveral fast food bags and take out containers littered our living room and there was a sizable pile of dishes in the sink. My roommate was sitting on the couch surrounded by crumbs. She asked me how my trip was and I told her I had a good time. I then asked her what happened to her agreeing to clean up the dishes. She told me she had fallen into a depressive episode and hadn\u2019t been able to get up from the couch, much less clean up the whole living room and kitchen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her I was upset because I was tired from my trip and wanted to come home to a clean house. She said I should understand because I have depression and often have trouble cleaning my dishes. I told her I would be more than willing to help her clean up if she needed, I just had the expectation that the apartment would be clean by the time I returned. She told me she could handle it herself and that cleaning may help her alleviate her depression. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA week later the dishes are still in the sink and have started to smell and the food on it started to mold. I offered to help again but she refused my help again. I told her she had one more day to clean her dishes or I would throw them away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day came and she still hadn\u2019t touched the dishes so that night I threw away the dishes. When my roommate noticed she began yelling at me and told me I had no right to touch her property. I felt justified because I had warned her and the plates were starting to mold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been staying with my partner for the last few days because she started to completely ice me out. Our mutual friends have been texting me and telling me to apologize because I shouldn\u2019t have thrown away her things and I feel really conflicted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for throwing away my roommate's dishes?", "created_utc": 1681828419, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qp1ly/aita_for_throwing_away_my_roommates_dishes/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's just flat out nasty.", "DISHES. The number one destroyer of college friendships smh. You gave her plenty of time to clean up and told her what would happen. Amazing to me how people cant take 10 minutes a day to clean their shit", "NTA. You warned her and gave her ample time to address the issue. \n\n But this is not a healthy living situation for either of you. If you both have depressive slumps bad enough that you don\u2019t clean to the point where it\u2019s not unheard of to go a week or more with dirty dishes in the sink, y\u2019all both need to be getting professional help. Or buying all paper plates and utensils so you don\u2019t have to clean anything.", "ESH. Throwing away her property was not ok.  Leaving moldy dishes in the sink is also not ok.  \n\nYou can buy paper plates and disposable cutlery at the dollar store.  It may create more garbage but when you are so depressed you can\u2019t keep a sanitary kitchen, temporarily using disposable dishes is probably a good solution.", "ESH\n\nYou threw away her property. \n\nShe can\u2019t be troubled to clean up after herself, basic cleanup at that (not detailing a limousine, just washing dishes/disposing of trash). \n\nBut the icing on this moldy cake\u2026you two apparently agree that this is somewhat normal and that leaving dirty dishes in the sink **for a week** is okay. You\u2019re both 22. I wouldn\u2019t accept this behavior from tweens. I\u2019ve dealt with depression personally, and at my worst I didn\u2019t live in a pig sty. That is just gross.", "I stopped reading at dishes being in the sink for a week. YTA both of you are the AH.", "ESH\n\nI don't think you are compatible as room mates, maybe you were once but this clearly isn't a tenable situation.\n\nBut you shouldn't throw out her property. That's not an acceptable reaction.", ">One of these boundaries is that dirty dishes have to be cleaned within a week of them being in the sink.\n\nwtf did I just read.\n\nESH.", "ESH.\n\nShe should've cleaned up after herself. She knew what the expectations were.\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown away her property.\n\nIMO the \"wash it within a week\" rule is contributing to both of your problems with cleaning up. I have major depressive disorder and find it more overwhelming to face dishes that are crusty or moldy, so I encourage you to try to pick a point of the day to do your dishes.\n\nThis way it'll be a smaller task for you.\n\nIf you want to mend the relationship with your roomie you should offer to replace what you threw away and discuss cleanliness habits. If she can't meet your standards you need to find another roommate as the two of you are enabling one another and the mess is probably making both of your depressive episodes worse.", "There's a tipping point for everyone. I would have taken all of the dishes, bagged them, and placed them in the room mate's room. Your continued offering of assistance makes you NTA: you'd have helped if they didn't insist they'd do it. Now it's done. \n\nTell your friends to mind their business, and tell your room mate they need to step up when they say they will or this sort of thing will occur again. It's harsh, but illness or no, some things still need to be done.", "NTA. Light e s h. She needs to learn to take care of herself. Yes, it's hard to do chores when we're depressed but avoiding chores only makes the depression worse. \n\nThrowing the dishes away probably wasn't the right thing to do. It would have been better to put her moldy dishes in a trash bag and put it in her room. \n\nShe isn't holding up on her end of the deal on being a roommate. It's not okay to let mold grow. \n\nYou should move out.", "ESH. You have no business touching her stuff. You are just as messy as she is. You two enable each other. It's not okay just because you said you'd do it. But, you are both slobs. That is gross. Buy disposable plates if you guys are that lazy. If it's legit due to depression, get help. Don't just live like that. It's so disgusting.", "ESH, your both super messy also sidenote idk why you expected to come home to a fully clean apartment given the rules in place, like basically everything you came back to bar the pizza box and dishes there before you left were actually permitted \n\nshe should start using paper plates when depressed or keeping plates ect in her room, you shouldn\u2019t throw away her property, dishes are expensive (just put it in a bag and shove it in her cupboards) \n\nIf she isn\u2019t seeing a doctor about her depression she needs to be but also I just don\u2019t think this is a good roommates situation full stop", "ESH\n\nShe should have just done her dishes, you should have put them in a cardboard box or something in front of her room instead of just throwing them out. \n\nWhen I'm in a state where I know I'm near incapable of properly cleaning shit, I switch to paper plates and disposable cutlery. Yes it's wasteful, but it sure beats having dishes in the sink for 2 weeks.", "if yall are both dirty people just get disposable everything. I'd lose my mind living with either one of you. leaving dishes in the sink for a WEEK?!? no way. ESH", "NTA\nI have depression and completely understand not wanting to clean. But you gave her 2 weeks and even offered to help her clean up. You deserve to live in a relatively clean house. If she can\u2019t keep dishes clean, tell her to get paper plates", "ESH. Who makes an agreement that dirty dishes can sit around for a week. If you still have a roommate, re-work your agreement. No wonder you are both depressed.", "the two of you appear to have a toxic dynamic.  If she goes a week without getting off of the couch how does she earn a living?  I'm surprised you don't have a bug or rodent problem with all of that going on--or maybe you do and just didn't mention it.    \n\n\nESH   You for throwing her dishes away (you should have put them in a trash bag and put the bag in her room or at least warned her that since they were a huge health hazard they needed to be washed immediately or put in the trash.  \n\nYour room mate because she needs to get professional help or find a way to live by herself. NO ONE should have to put up with living in squalor like that.  \n\n\nYour friends because they dont' live with the consequences of room mate's actions and so need to either volunteer to come over and do her dishes or mind their own business.", "ESH. You\u2019re both gross. How do you just let food sit and rot. Totally nasty.", "ESH I would have double bagged them into a garbage bag & left them in the middle of her bed the day after you returned home. She should have the choice to trash them or clean them without cluttering up the kitchen.", "ESH\n\nWhat a toxic living environment. Depression sucks, but sometimes it really helps to start working your way out of it. Its not an excuse to be lazy or potentially live in a situation that is hazardous to the health of the people. Throwing the dishes away was completely childish. Are you trying to teach her a lesson? Just fucking clean them, it would have been 30 min of your time. You can be merciful and graceful, forgiving of wrongs and have a peaceful(and clean for your own sake) home environment, or you can be spiteful, bitter, and rude, dirty one. Just do the work and kick her out after some time.", "NTA, but for the love of Thor, get a cleaning lady so your dishes are at least done once a week.  It's only an apartment and you can hire someone to just clean the shared areas.  There may be someone in your complex who does housecleaning or a cleaner who comes to your complex.  Peace of mind is worth the money.", "NTA the plates were becoming a health hazard. You were more than patient. If she can walk to the couch, she can put her trash in the garbage can and load the dishwasher. Your roommate is using depression as an excuse for laziness. If her problem is that serious she should be in a therapy session, not vegging on the couch and ignoring basic responsibilities.", "NTA You repeatedly asked your roommate to clean up after herself. She said she would but didn't. Now the dishes are smelling and moldy. Time to throw out the old and put in the new (paper plates and paper bowls and plastic utensils).", "Nta", "NTA.

If the depression afflicting both of you is so severe it doesn\u00b4t allow to perform basic activities of self care, maybe you both should look for professional help.  There are some assisted living facilities and nursing homes that provide structured living for people with severe mental illness", "NTA. At this point you warned her and she still didn't do anything. So gross. Next time, just bag them up and put the bag in her room", "People with mental illness that struggle with basic self care. I've gone way longer than a week, but it's always my personal space, not shared spaces.", " Agreed. Two depressed roommates who are leaning into their depression is a recipe for disaster. Double when you see ppl who both have multiple mental health issues getting married or living together. Work on yourself before living with others! \n\nThat being said, while it\u2019s great that we live in a time where the stigma of having mental health issues is dissipating; it seems that too many people stop there and use it as an excuse for their behavior instead of an explanation. \n\nI don\u2019t think \u201cjust suck it up\u201d applies to every situation. But some of the things that people act as if they are insurmountable, might not be if you didn\u2019t listen to your brain telling you they are. \n\nOf course, that\u2019s not applicable to everyone. But some people with anxiety/depression could be doing a lot better than they claim. Laziness towards treating the issue may be part of the problem. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure current psychiatric practice isn\u2019t leaning into your anxiety/depression/ocd what have you.

It'll just be more trash to pile up that OP will have to deal with.", "Exactly. I also, even with all my issues, find it easier to clean shared spaces, while I can barely pick up the clothes from my own floor or brush my teeth. When living alone, it can get really messy, because only I am responsible for it and I have no one else to respect other than me lol.", "That\u2019s the biggest thing about mental health disorders - so often they make your brain lie to you. \u201cThis is the hardest thing in the world\u201d and then you finally get motivation to do it for whatever reason and you\u2019re like \u201coh this took five fucking minutes, should\u2019ve just done it earlier, would\u2019ve been less stress.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why CBT is so helpful, breaks up that feedback loop of \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re right you can\u2019t\u201d with \u201cokay but maybe you could do a little bit if you tried, why not 5 minutes?\u201d And slowly but surely you start to change your thought processes around some of these things.", "It would be better.
