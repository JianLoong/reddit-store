Moms know their kids, they know who puts in effort and who doesn't. If me and my four siblings send my mom flowers with everyone's names, she knows I or my older sister picked them out and arranged the shipment and paid for all or most. If we all give her a gift - a good well thought out gift that she will use - she knows my littlest sister came up with the idea and picked it out and we either all chipped in or the oldest kids paid. Mom's don't miss much about that sort of thing, and I'm positive she would know who truly put effort in and who just signed the card.\n\nI say all that just as a reassurance cause im sure this isn't the first time, and possibly not the last, but please allow me to reiterate that you are 100% right and shouldn't have to share your gift and I hope you're able to stand your ground!", "NTA.

It\u2019s not cheap, but not out of my means. \n\nLast week, my sister asked if I\u2019ve gotten a present and  if it\u2019s ok for her to split the gift with me, since we are pretty close, I unwillingly agreed. \n\nToday, she asked me if it\u2019s okay to split it three ways with my brother cause he would be left out and it would be mean of us to exclude him.

It cost $xx, a third of that is $xx so that's how much you owe me.", "NTA\n\nFair enough if they were just busy or low on time however, this is just lazy. They are selfish for tagging on your gift instead of preparing their own gift.", "NTA at all. Don\u2019t share with your sister either.\n\nYou picked out a thoughtful gift for your mom. They\u2019ll look bad to her because they put no effort toward her birthday and that\u2019s THEIR fault", "NTA. The one who actually thought about your mother and ordered a gift is not the selfish one in the story. This day is not about them but your mother.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey waited until the last minute and likely have nothing. That\u2019s on them, not you.", "NTA my brothers did that one year - they forgot entirely about MD and so I just handed my mom my gift being none the wiser about their situation. My older brother got mad at me and said I was showing them up... Like for what? Because you couldn't be bothered to think about someone else instead of yourself? Nope not my problem. They all boogied about with some excuse about forgetting something and they all ran out to buy her something whoke we sat there knowing exactly what they were up to.", "NTA.  They can go find their own gift to give.  You put in the thought, time, and effort.  They aren't entitled to ride your coattails.", "siblings didn't plan, didn't put any thought into the gift and now want to glom on to the thoughtful gift you purchased.\n\nI would be miffed at my siblings somehow taking credit for something like that.\n\nThat want you to save them from their callousness.\n\nNTA", "NTA technically....\n\nAs a youngest sister I've shown up to many family events with a pen to attach my name. Takes a minute to break out of this", "NAH. My siblings and I sometimes share gift-giving, and sometimes not. Sounds like the brother was just asking, and it sounds like the sister was okay either way as well.", "Yeah actually they did intend to pay their share. Altho I don\u2019t mind paying for the whole thing cause that\u2019s the plan in the first place.", "Yeah I probably have a problem saying no to people\u2026", "Yeah I think reluctantly agreed is a better word. I didn\u2019t wanna create any issues so I just said ok altho I did not actually wanted to!", "Thanks for reiterating this cause they certainly are making me feel like I\u2019m the crazy bossy older sister. \n\nBut yes you\u2019re right I think my mom would know who\u2019s idea was it anyway. I just think they should think of what to get too cause it it\u2019s the thought that counts when it comes to gifting!", "When my mom was having her retirement party, I showed after my brother. He asked if I got Mommie a gift. I said I did and watched him seal his card. I realized he was waiting to see what I had going on. It touched me. But made me realize that I needed to stop freeloading off him", "NTA\n\nTell them not to ask you again.", "It's a common problem, specially in families. Try to work on that with counseling because later on, if they continue to be this lazy and unorganized, they could get you in trouble. NTA btw.", "Practice saying no. Try it with little to no explanation.  \"No.\"\nIt gets easier. Dont worry about the silence that follows. If they ask why \"because I'm not interested in doing that\" dont argue or explain \"you asked I answered, subject is closed\"\nOnce you master the simple, matter of fact no, it becomes your SUPERPOWER", "Just not to your brother?", "They should! There is nothing wrong with group gifts, but that should be the plan from the beginning with everyone contributing and generally escalating the scale of the gift beyond what it would be if it was from one person. You shouldn't just take a gift that was intended to be from one person, within the budget of a single person, and then slap three names on it. \n\nThree gifts in one is cool, splitting one gift three ways with two parties doing nothing to select it is just lazy. \n\nThe one exception is if your siblings are minors and don't have access to money. Then it would be nice of you to let them join in, especially if there is no other patent in the household to help them arrange the gift. You aren't required mind you, but it would be kind."]}
