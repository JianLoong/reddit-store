It devastated me, I was more or  less in mourning, and I even  broke down crying when I saw some cute baby  socks at a store. My  friends Clare, Ellen, and Lisa (all 29f) supported  me during that time,  and when I got better, I went back to the store to  buy those socks. I  did this as a promise to myself, that I wasn't gonna  be bitter, that my  friends' babies would be a source of joy and loved  by their cool aunty  (me). I told my friends that I was gonna give the  socks to the first  baby of our friend group and I've spent the years  since then genuinely  looking forward to that moment.\n\nLisa   has always jokingly (but actually quite seriously) insisted that she   would be the one to get those socks. Her husband and her have been   trying for a baby for about five years, and next March they are going to   have a baby girl. We were overjoyed when she told us the news a few   months ago, and literally the first thing she told me was \"I'm gonna get   those socks, told ya!\". It got even better when a few weeks later,   Ellen told us that she too was going to have a baby, due in late May   next year. However, Ellen and her boyfriend then got the devastating   news that their little girl has a rare genetic disorder. She might not   make it to her due date and is going to live for a couple of hours, if   she is born alive at all. Her parents have decided to continue with the   pregnancy as long as possible and to donate their daughter's organs if   that's possible.\n\nWe're all   heartbroken for them, of course. It's hardly the most important thing   right now, but I've been thinking about giving the socks to Ellen's baby   instead of Lisa's. I just want Ellen and her bf to know that their   child matters to us, that there is joy in the fact that she exists. The   joy I promised I was always gonna feel for my friends' kids. When I  told  Lisa, however, she started crying and told me that she doesn't  think  it's fair when she tried to have a child for five years, while  Ellen  tried for maybe six months and won't even have the first born.  She says  that she deserves them for managing to have the first child  despite her  fertility struggles. Clare thinks Lisa is being selfish,  and I'm  inclined to agree, but at the same time, I understand that this  is  something she has been dreaming of for so long, even though it's  only a  pair of cute socks.

Two of them. Pretty frames. One for each. The socks aren't socks any more. They represent the hope that your friends would be mothers one day and your love for their future kids. Make mementos instead. \n\nI feel for all the pain that all three of you have been going through. Sure Lisa gets a happy ending(?) maybe, but her journey will have been hard. And knowing that she and her friends won't be able to fully celebrate her baby because it might be too painful for Ellen is probably adding a lot of pain to her 'happy' outcome. So I don't love her behaviour but I do have a bit of sympathy for her. \n\nPersonally I would have bought Ellen a beautiful new baby gift and kept with the original long-communicated plan of socks for the first. You seem to have created some unnecessary drama with an unnecessary change at an emotionally stressful time for all. But what's done is done. \nNAH", "This is pretty close to no assholes, but I'd say that YTA a little bit here.\n\nAll of you are dealing with some pretty heavy grief and extreme emotions due to pregnancy/fertility related struggles, but you've chosen a method of consoling Ellen that results in explicitly taking back something you promised Lisa that she has been looking forward to, that is *also* a symbol you care about her and her children. Surely you can come up with some way to show you care about your friend without doing the literally one singular thing that takes away from Lisa and explicitly makes it clear you value her pregnancy struggles less than Ellen's, right?\n\nAlso, while this probably isn't something you want to hear or think about, I am certain that part of Lisa's grief is that you have chosen to give a practical, useful symbol of a living newborn to a baby that will never get to wear them, which makes it doubly hurtful to her.\n\nE: To the other commenters saying that Lisa is being childish, fertility struggles are extremely rough mentally *and* she's actively pregnant, it's totally understandable for her to have big feelings about symbolic gestures of support for her pregnancy. Five years of infertility means five years of struggles with her own potential miscarriages or grief that's no less valid than Ellen's.", "NAH\n\nDid everyone already sort of \u2018agree\u2019 that the socks are going to Lisa? Since she\u2019s having the first baby? \n\nSo you want to give the socks to Ellen because she\u2019s going to lose her child? Even though said child would be the 2nd child in your group? \n\nHonestly, if it were me, being gifted those socks, which have such huge meaning in your little group, I would think would be more painful. She has to keep a pair of super sentimental socks for a child that has died? And every time she sees them it\u2019s just a reminder of it?\n\nMaybe the socks just need to stay with you.", "This is a tough situation to be in for all of you. NAH.\n\nI think Lisa should get the socks, they would have gone to her if Ellen's baby wasn't having complications. Also 5 years of trying to get pregnant and finally succeeding would have been hugely emotional and I think taking away this present that everyone knew would go to the first child born in the group is a slap in the face. \n\nBut you could get a nice personalised memorial gift for Ellen and her husband to represent the significance of their loss and their courage/selflessness in donating their daughters organs to save another life. \n\nYou should also be prepared that the group may fracture between Lisa and Ellen anyway. Lisa's baby is likely going to be born first and a huge reminder of Ellen and her husbands loss. Every happy milestone you all celebrate with Lisa will be a knife to the heart for Ellen.", "Honestly, its just some socks. But I understand that it has sentimental value to you and your friends. My advise would be to split the socks (since they come in pairs) and give one to Lisa and one to Ellen in order to keep the peace.\n\nAlthough Lisa is acting a little unhinged over a pair of socks, it isn't supposed to be a competition, I hope you and your friends are aware of that.\n\nNTA everyone except Lisa a little bit.", "Slightly different to others opinions I see, but I will give YTA if you go ahead with your plan.\n\nEither make momentos like u/Short-Ad-9388 or buy both a pair of socks(do it for all babies), and I\u2019d lean towards not. Tough one though OP", "NAH. This is a lot of emotion over a freaking pair of socks. Your friend is about to lose a child and who won the socks is not gonna matter at all!", "YTA. First baby is first baby period. Kind of a slap in the face to Lisa when Ellen\u2019s baby is not only going to be born after, but not even live\u2026 it\u2019s harsh to say but those are the facts. There is no reason for Ellen to get the socks. Get her a different gift", "NAH - This is not assholery, this is a deeply symbolic thing loaded with meaning.\nI would suggest (if these socks are still buyable) to get another pair and give both a pair or split the pair and frame them with a fitting saying or sth.", "jesus, some of these comments. it's about more than the socks.\n\nNAH, try to not make this into a whole thing anymore than it already is. those socks clearly mean a lot to lisa and you should find something else to do for ellen- saw a comment saying frame the socks for each woman.\n\nyou could get a pair that aren't quite the same but are similar or matchy to the socks you already have and give both lisa and ellen an old and new sock- frame ellen's socks and give lisa the others for her child to wear.", "Is Lisa being selfish? Maybe a little. But it seems like she\u2019s the one who\u2026 cares about the socks. So why not give them to her?\n\nEllen has just received horrible, horrible news and I cannot imagine she is going to care either way about a pair of socks you bought years ago. Find another way to support your friend who is grieving, and give the socks to the friend who cares about receiving the socks. NAH here though.", "YTA and a shitty friend. Lisa IS having the first baby in the group she\u2019s still gonna be a parent even if her kid doesn\u2019t make it, also you never specified that the kid has to be alive so by technicality Lisa is actually supposed to get the sock. But you\u2019re just a shitty person with shitty bias so I hope for Lisa sake she has other friends who actually care.", "Far out this is over the top but NAH. Just give it to the baby born first. Thats what you bought them for so thats what you do.", "Jesus. \n\nLisa, and possibly Clare, are being entirely too childish for women nearly thirty and about to become mothers. \n\nYes, there's history behind it, but they're *socks*. Lisa has weird hangups if she thinks 'first baby' is something to really be invested in, in any way at all, let alone this much. \n\nMaybe you have to King Solomon it and propose to split the pair of socks, one each.", "NAH\n\nOh, OP. I know that for many here Lisa might sound a bit unhinged but fertility treatments are really hard on a person. It's not just your body that they mess with but all the hormone imbalance and since she has been doing this for 5 years now the heartache for every failed treatment. it's hard. \n\njust to put this in perspective why she might think that this is unfair, when battling infertility it's more then likely that she has had some miscarriage's as well. just because you don't know about them doesn't mean that they did not happen. \n\nYou also made a promise and as silly as it was this was something that for her was a source of strength.\n\nTalk to your friend, she is in a very vulnerable position at the moment and her hormones are probably not helping with keeping calm and collected. and for the socks i would give them to her, maybe go together with everyone else and buy something for the other baby.", "This cannot be true. Seriously over a pair of socks. This is petty ass shit.", "ESH. Do everyone a favor and have a burning ceremony over the socks.", "So, you cannot have children, even though you wanted to and Ellen got massively devastating news about most probably losing her baby, but Lisa feels justified to cry about maybe not getting socks??? WT actual F is wrong with her? \n\nNTA", "Not the asshole, they are yours to gift to whomever, given Lisa's reaction says alot, your friend us about to go through a very traumatic heartbreaking thing ever, she's lacking alot of sympathy. I wouldn't be gifting them to her. I'd be doing the sane as you. There's going to be other special things you can buy for their baby.", "NTA - If Lisa is having a healthy baby she should understand why you'd want to support and show love to your friend, when Ellen has gotten such devastating news about her child and you want this to be an act of caring.  \n\nLisa sounds like she's turned life into a ridiculous contest and it's kind of disgusting she can be so callous over not getting a pair of socks.", "NAH. Lisa\u2019s reaction is justifiable - especially while pregnant - but this gesture is undeniably going to mean a lot to Ellen, and it\u2019s ultimately your choice what to do with the socks that you purchased. Although\u2026 I do wonder if there\u2019s any creative way you could give them both a sock from that pair!", "ESH - you least of all though but Lisa is way over the top over it and the main arse here.\n\nIt's been blown up much bigger than it should be.  \n\nIt seems that everyone in the group seems to know that Lisa was going to get the socks.\n\nJust give her the damn socks and say that she was the first to get pregnant which is why she's getting the sock rather than it being about the first baby born.   And really that's what this is.  Lisa got pregnant first and everyone knew she was going to get that.\n\nBut for Ellen, I would handmake a very special gift as a rememberence for her daughter.  This will have so much more meaning for her than a pair of socks you bought at a store.  And it would be made especially for her.  It may be something you commission. Have a think about something that would hold so much more meaning for her than a generic (but cute) pair of socks.\n\nI'd give Lisa the socks now to be done with it.  First to get pregnant and all that.  Have a chat with Ellen first to let her know this and also find out what would hold the most meaning for her in a gift that a friend gets for her.  She may like some jewellery where she can add all her kids name to it (though that's a partner or her thing to do normally).  Maybe a special bear that can hold a photo and a lock of hair (you'll be able to buy something like this).  Perhaps a special pair of handmade booties and a blanket as a memento?  There's lots of options.  Can you sew or knit/crochet?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
