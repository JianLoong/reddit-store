We all have different economic situations. Three friends could not afford to stay at the resort. We all found a different resort 5 min away that is around $75 per night (so we\u2019re going to pay like $400 total which is less than one night at the other place). We were planning on take a taxi to/from the wedding. We are going to stay for 4 nights to make a mini vacation out of it.\n\nFound out the bride and a bridesmaid are upset with us for not staying at the resort where there is a block. Basically saying it is selfish to make a vacation out of a wedding and that we should stay at the resort with everyone else.

That frequently happens in the US. In fact, you might contact the wedding resort for a room without saying you\u2019re with the wedding party. You might find the price is much lower. I\u2019ve had that experience with wedding blocks.", "Definitely NTA.  They\u2019re just upset with you because they likely get a discount depending on how many rooms in the block get reserved, but this is absolutely not your issue to solve. And it\u2019s also not selfish to book what you can afford.  The alternative is not going at all.  Destination weddings are not command performances (for that matter, weddings are not command performances). You don\u2019t get to get your panties in a twist because invited guests choose a different accommodation from your chosen venue. Or if those same guests choose to make attending your destination something more.  I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re required to give them a heads up about where you\u2019re staying. That\u2019s a load of controlling BS. \n\nI\u2019ve grown quite weary of this current trend where brides/grooms think their weddings should be the only event of consequence in the months preceding and following their big day. Frack that. My life doesn\u2019t stop just because someone\u2019s getting married. I am happy to celebrate with you, but you are not the main character in my life.\n\nEDIT:  just wanted to say - enjoy that mini vacay. If the bride continues to whine, just skip the wedding and have fun with your friends.", "I bet you anything the couple were getting a discount on the wedding based on how many people booked. You have no obligation to stay at the same resort. It\u2019s ridiculous to expect people to fly abroad for your wedding and to make a vacation out of it.\n\nEnjoy your holiday and ignore them. All you owe them is an RSVP. Getting a block of rooms for your guests is fine but they are not obligated to use it. \n\nPersonally I make a practice of staying elsewhere when I attend destination weddings.

Why is it a destination?.... Because people want to go there for a vacation.  If they did not want anyone staying anywhere else that should have been in the invite.  If they didn't want people staying elsewhere they would have balanced the financial ability of the people they were inviting with the cost of the venue vs. close by places.

Otherwise, if she keeps pushing, just cancel the trip altogether.", "NTA\n\nThey're acting as sales agents for the expensive place to get free stuff.", "NTA. Destination weddings are selfish, not trying to save money and make the most of your trip. I didn't have a destination wedding but a lot of my family and friends lived about 10 hours away from us and where the wedding took place. We had rooms at the hotel attached to the venue but actively advised people to find cheaper options if possible. It was $200-300/night and we knew that was cost prohibitive for some people so we sent them AirBnB links, cheaper hotels, etc because it's an inconvenience to travel and we appreciated they were making the effort to come at all", "As others said the bride is getting some discount based on the number of rooms guests book. One thing to check though is if there is a fee for off-site guests to attend the wedding.  Many of these resorts will charge extra or not allow guests to attend the wedding if they are not staying at the property.", "INFO\n\nDo they have to rent a minimum of rooms out of that block to have the special rates (I'm assuming they have a better rate).\n\nAND did they clearly wrote in the invitation that staying at that resort was expected/mandated?", "NTA\n\nDestination weddings (and the price of weddings in general) are getting out of hand. \n\nAround 2010 my daughter was invited to a good friend\u2019s destination wedding in Jamaica.

I think that\u2019s fine. \n\nIf the couple is too upset about it, just don\u2019t go.", "NTA, you are choosing rooms you can afford and even if you could afford it, I wouldn't want to spend 500$ a night for a room for a wedding. Also, even IF you would make a vacation put of it so what, that's your business. And I think quite some people do that when going to destination weddings, that they add a few days before or after for vacation.", "NTA also they Very likely have a \u2018block of rooms\u2019 for guests to book as part of a deal with the resort to have their own stay paid for or made significantly cheaper for themselves.  It\u2019s common practice for resorts to do this to get guests.", "Definitely NTA... It's her prerogative to choose an expensive place for her destination wedding but she has to understand that not everyone can afford you stay there. IMO she's lucky you're coming at all... It's already an expensive endeavor without paying for an expensive resort to boot. Go if you wanna go but don't feel bad about making sure the trip fits in your budget", "NTA, If they feel it is so important to stay at the resort, then they can cover it on their dime, not yours. And, lets be real.  Do the newlyweds want to spend their entire time entertaining their guests and wedding party, I think not.  They are going to disappear after the wedding and do their own thing, you can do the same thing and not feel guilty about it.", "NTA when you plan a wedding on some level you have to keep the guests budgets in mind. Who cares if you stay at another resort? Maybe they need X number of people to stay at their booking for some financial reason but they should have considered how many of their guests could make it work.", "NTA-", "NTA- lol at the it\u2019s a wedding not a vacation when it\u2019s a destination wedding", "The bride and groom are probably being comped their room if they get enough guests to stay at the resort.

If she doesn't want her wedding to be a vacation, she shouldn't have done a destination wedding. Between airfair, hotel, and wedding gift, it's probably over $200 to go. May as well stay juts down the road for cheaper and actually have a vacation while on destination.", "NTA. Why are couples surprised when their friends want to attend their wedding without subsidizing it by staying somewhere pricier than they would choose on their own?", "NTA\n\nAll destination weddings I have been to, bride and groom or their family provide accommodation (sometimes even travel) free of cost. I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts on Reddit where people even contribute money to bridesmaids dresses, which is absurd to me, so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not common. If your friends wanted everyone to stay at the resort and pay themselves, they should have picked something more budget friendly.\n\nYour not staying at the resort doesn\u2019t affect their wedding in any way. It\u2019s weird that they\u2019re arguing for this. It\u2019s possible that they may have to be at certain capacity to comp prices for bride and groom (read about a similar situation in another post).", "Nta they just want you to stay at resort because they have deal with resort. You don't have to spend money on expensive room for them to get discount. Their financial problems is their business to deal.", "NTA.  They want you to stay at the resort because they are most likely getting the wedding venue either free or discounted based on the number of rooms occupied by the wedding party and/or guests.  They are basically wanting YOU to subsidize their wedding costs.", "NTA. You're close enough for a destination wedding invite , but not bachelor/ette parties?  That is wild to me.  Sounds like they needed to fill x number of rooms at the resort or something to get theirs free.   Also a consideration is most of those resorts are all inclusive.  So if they are hosting wedding events leading up to the wedding you most likely can't go if it's at their resort.", "NTA.\n\nThe block of rooms is supposed to be a mutually beneficial voluntary arrangement where they get discounted rates for guaranteeing a certain amount of guests. The way they selected things, they disregarded what works for other people and as a result you're choosing something that does work. That's really on them. I don't think you needed to tell them you weren't doing the block rate and I don't think they really have any standing to care what you did.\n\nYou're not in the wedding party so it's pretty standard that outside of the wedding itself, you're not involved. If you're traveling to another country, it makes sense that you'd need a little time to unwind instead of just hopping right back on a plane. So, it makes sense that you'd make a little vacation out of it. If they want you in their block because presumably even not during the wedding it's all about them, then they should take the same attitude in return and be supplying you meals, entertainment, etc. during that time.", "NTA. Unless they are willing to pay for those expensive rooms. they don't have any right to complain. $500 a night is an absolutely insane price to pay for a room. They're pissy because they would have gotten a discount for that block of rooms.
