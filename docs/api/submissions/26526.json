At some point they need the opportunity to meet their extended family.  Maybe now the ex will agree to allow them on a trip.", "OK I am torn.  \n\n\nThis one can go either way.  It all depends on what happened BEFORE the trip.  \n\n\nDid your kids know you were going?  Did you ask your Ex if they could come, and she said NO.  If those two things NTA.  \n\n\nWas this trip a surprise to your kids?  Did you even ask your EX if they could come?  If these two things YTA.  \n\n\nSure it is great you were able to take PART of your family on this outstanding adventure, but you have two other kids, and leaving them behind really shows that you see them as second class citizens in your own family.", "INFO  \n\n\nI think it depends on the age of the kid from your first marriage. If you honestly wanted to take these kids on these big adventures, and your ex just would not allow it. That doesn't make you an asshole, and it's totally fine to go see your family back home alone if your ex wouldn't allow your kids to join. Taking your new kids to see your home and extended family, and posting it on instagram is again totally fine. You shouldn't have to hide a portion of your life from your other kids, and those are beautiful memories you want to share.   \n\n\nTelling your kids their mother wouldn't allow them to go, and showing them the pictures of all they missed, I would say depends on age. If they're like 11 and going to hate their mom, I'd say YTA, but if they are reasonably adult age, hurt because you are in their eyes showing your new kids a better time and introducing them to your extended family making them feel almost unwelcome in your extended family, and you don't want that shit on you? NTA. Besides you have said that you took your kids on all sorts of vacation so why shouldn't your new kids get similar experiences?  \n\n\nHonestly I think it just comes down to your intent and your older kids ability to reasonably process it, and you know that in your heart.", "Info: did your other kids not want to go or just your ex wife?

They must be old enough to understand that they should speak Spanish, and you could buy them the Duolingo app. Why didn't you ask your ex if you could take them on this trip?\n\nI think the only way you salvage this is to encourage your older kids to learn some Spanish, and take them (maybe for 2 weeks) next summer. \n\nIt's not THEIR fault that their mom is an AH. Make it happen for them.", "YTA if you did not offer to take your kids by your ex. What happened when you were married has nothing to do with how you treat your children today. You are punishing your children by her because of what happened before.", "YTA\n\nYTA for not bringing your other kids with you. Why would you leave them behind on such a big trip? Of course your ex wasn't entitled to go, but all of your kids should have gone. After we split up, my ex went to Disney with his gf and her kid.

Would it be easier if they knew some Spanish? Sure. But like, he's their dad, he could also translate for them on vacation. That's their extended family too that he doesn't seem to care that he's cutting them off from.\n\nHe blames his ex-wife for not letting the kids take \"Spanish as a second language\" classes, but why would that even have been necessary if their dad was a fluent Spanish speaker? My nieces are fluently bilingual and have never taken a Spanish class in their life. Their South American dad just . . . spoke to them in Spanish their whole lives. It sounds like OP never made any effort at all to just speak Spanish to them at home, even occasionally, much less immersively. Like, even if his ex didn't want him to speak to them exclusively in Spanish, he could have made sure they learned some BASIC phrases just from talking to them around the house - enough to interact with family when they visited. There's literally no reason why they should have needed language classes. \n\nThis is definitely an ESH situation. Their mother may be an AH for cutting them off from their paternal heritage, but it doesn't sound like OP really cared much about it either, and now he's punishing them for something they had no control over, and acting like there's literally no point in taking them to see family just because he'd have to interpret.

All he had to do is ask and let them know. Pretty low bar.", "Probably, but OP admits the vacation was something amazing, and he didn't even try to take 1/2 of his kids on the trip.  That is pretty darn bad.", "He has said that he has tried for a decade to do this trip, inturn he has taken them to others that he is allowed to.  He is now being approached by ex because they wanna know why he didn't take them. He has a valid reason I tried to do this with you for 10 years and was met with no. \n\nLegally it is hard to leave a country without the other parents written consent. Many don't know that. Even if you go to court, all one parent has to say is that they fear you are taking the children abroad for good to pose cause for concern on top of that the court process is long for this kind of thing and can take up to years to come to an order. \n\nI wouldn't stop one set of children because one ex made it difficult for me with my first children. I'd let them know I love them, and I will do this with them when they come of age as mum has made it difficult for me.\n\nDifference of opinion I guess but I have been through this, it's not easy"]}
