{"id": 18436, "submission_id": "13ughtz", "title": "WIBTA for demanding my SIL repay me for damages after taking my motorcycle?", "selftext": "So a few days ago my boyfriend's sister decided to take my motorcycle to work. She asked my boyfriend and he said yes. Neither one checked with me until she'd already left. I was not home at the time. He called me after she had left to tell me that she had taken my bike to work. Anyway, she rode about 4.5 miles from the house before the incident.\n\nThis is where the details get fuzzy. She claimed she saw a child in the road, so she pulled onto the opposite side of the road, where the child lived, but supposedly, she did not know that at the time. She parked, claims she put the kickstand down, but got off the wrong side and said she felt the weight of the bike against her. Then, while knowing she was holding it, she walked away to get the kid and let the bike fall in the gravel. Another person called the police over the child. She claims she got the child and took a picture with the kid for some reason. She says another child came to take that child from her. My boyfriend says that when he got there, he did not see the kid.\n\nShe called my boyfriend to come get the bike. My boyfriend decided he didn't want a police report and the bike \"wasn't damaged\" so now I'm left holding the repairs for the bike. The repairs, while cosmetic, are about 300-400 dollars depending on the muffler. She didn't even talk to the officers at the scene. She left in my boyfriend's car while he drove the bike home. Would I be the asshole for demanding that one of them pay for the cosmetic repairs? I want to add that I do understand her decision and why she made it, but actions have consequences, and I don't think I should be out of the money to fix it. I have spoken to my boyfriend about her riding my bike in the past. She does have a license but has not taken a  safety course, nor does she have any gear. She was using mine until I told them to stop using my gear for her.", "created_utc": 1685321910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ughtz/wibta_for_demanding_my_sil_repay_me_for_damages/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
