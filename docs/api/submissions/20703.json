I have 1 daughter from a previous relationship Tasha(16f) and Eliza has 2 daughters, Keighly (16f) and Kenzie (17f).\n\nkeighly and Kenzie did not like Tasha. Tasha is half black the rest of us is white so some racist comments were made by the girls. Tasha really laid into them. Kenzie walked away with a broken nose.\n\nMy wife was upset with Tasha and yelled. I told her not to yell at my child, and explained that if anything like this ever happened again her daughters will be sent to live with their dad. The house was mine before they moved in and the girls didn\u2019t like living with their dad because he was an alcoholic. So ever since that day I haven\u2019t seen a thing happen.That was two years ago. The girls did really well in school this year and we decided that a vacation was well deserved.\n\nI got two bedrooms one with a queen size bed and one with two beds and a couch for the girls. We ended up getting in late so instead of doing any site seeing we just walked the streets of Tokyo. Keighly and Kenzie were talking about a cute guy and he walked over so they assumed he wanted to talk to him, but instead he wanted to talk to Tasha. He complimented her on her huge bouncy afro and her style (it\u2019s y2k style) and asked for a picture. That\u2019s how it was for the rest of the night, she was like a celebrity. It was honestly amazing.\n\nWe get to the hotel rooms and right before I get ready for bed, I get a call from Tasha who was upset saying she has no where to sleep. Their room is right next door, so I go over and look at the two girls protecting each bed. I ask what\u2019s the problem. Tasha explains that she\u2019s willing to sleep on the couch but they won\u2019t move their stuff.I ask them to move their stuff and they ask me where are they going to put it. I tell them place them in the drawers and closets. They tell me no so I call my wife and she says just tell Tasha to put some covers on the floor to sleep. I hang up and leave and come back with a key for Tasha.\n\nThey realized that I got her a room and Kenzie was upset because she\u2019s the oldest. I told her to get over her self. By time I walked Tasha to her room and got back my wife yelled at me for playing favorites. I said I wasn\u2019t going to have Tasha sleep on the floor. She called Tasha a brat and causing problems with the vacation and family like she always does. I asked her what was that supposed mean. She sighed in frustration and said forget it but sleeping on the floor wouldn\u2019t hurt nobody and Tasha needs to stop acting like a brat.\n\nI told her if she believes it\u2019s not a big deal why don\u2019t she sleep on the floor tonight then. I laid diagonally, taking up the entire bed and she began yelling at me that I couldn\u2019t be serious. I told her stop acting like a brat. When she realized that I wasn\u2019t moving she left to the girls room and slept there.\n\nI don\u2019t feel bad about getting Tasha her own room but maybe I could\u2019ve talked to my wife better.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687840766, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14k3jma/aita_for_getting_my_daughter_her_own_room/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
