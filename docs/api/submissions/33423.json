It really helped me stick with my decision to not go to the wedding. I wanted to update earlier but its been pretty hectic with work.  \nSo, after the many texts and calls from multiple family members, I sent a text to all the numbers detailing what dad did and why I choose to be no contact with him. I then blocked all the numbers. I have changed my number but kept the old number in a separate phone to collect evidence if they start to harass me from random numbers. But luckily nothing happened and I thought that was that.  \nA week or so after that, my aunt's fianc\u00e9 came to my apartment. He knows what time I get off work and was waiting for me in the parking lot. I was apprehensive but he assured me he only wanted to talk. And according to him the text I sent has caused a shitstorm in that family. He told me that some of the cousins who did not know what happened in the past started to question dad and affair partner and they started to get defensive and deny it but someone revealed that it was true. This has caused a massive argument within the family with some cousins pulling out of the wedding. Dad wanted to postpone the wedding so he can talk to me but the affair partner threatened to leave him if he did that. The news of what dad and affair partner did also reached some of their friends who were at one point friends of my mom as well. Some of them has also pulled out of the wedding and this caused the affair partner to have a breakdown and started banning anyone who brings it up, family members included from the wedding. According to aunt's fianc\u00e9 she is blaming this all on me, says I did this intentionally. I laughed at that. The wedding is still somehow happening.  \nI asked him about my aunt and how all this started and he said all he knows is that there was a conversation of how bad the family would look if I wasn't at the wedding and that my aunt offered to call me. He said that he disagreed but she did it anyway. He said that he is only here because he felt I needed to know what happened. I thanked him but said I will be going completely no contact with her and by extension him as well. He agreed, wished me well and left.  \nI am not going to lie and say I am completely ok. I miss my aunt. I miss my mom. But I know what I did was the right thing. I am currently staying with my girlfriend and she has been cheering me up by coming up with absurd ways to ruin the wedding. As a lot of you said, I should try therapy and I am going to take that advice. Some of the comments has made me realize that I have bottled up a lot of grief and anger. I am super nervous about it but I also feel it'll do me good. So, once again, thank you for all your comments and advice.

Lol honey if you didn\u2018t want people to find out you shouldn\u2018t have had an affair with a married man. It is as simple as that. But people like her are just dumb and delusional. I hope you have a nice life with your gf.", "Your father cheated on your mother with one of her friends, during a most vulnerable time when she really needed him to be there.  He could have waited and done the standup thing by her, instead, he went off to dip his stick.  You handled your aunt's betrayal as gracefully as one could under the circumstances.  I'm glad the family knows what he did.  If they had just left you alone, they would not have to worry about everyone knowing and talking.  \n\nThe girlfriend is a rockstar here and glad you have her in your life.  Take care and go live your best life.  That marriage is not going to last and if it does, it'll probably be filled with doubts and suspicion since they both are cheaters.", "NTA  \"...*she has been cheering me up by coming up with absurd ways to ruin the wedding*.\"  I can't think of anything that has been more effective than your going public in the way that you did.\n\nEventually, things will calm down.

They're the ones who sought out the truth and remained loyal to you.", "So a word about therapy because it can be easy to get discouraged by bad experiences. You do not have to stick with a therapist if you feel they\u2019re not the right fit. Some you\u2019ll know right off the bat to skip, some it\u2019ll take two or three sessions and you\u2019ll just want to go a different route.

In general people don\u2019t like cheaters and they don\u2019t like being lied to, add those two together and I don\u2019t blame anyone for pulling out of the wedding and this is by no means your fault, you don\u2019t force them to take their clothes off and sleep with each other, you didn\u2019t force them to lie to people about the situation, they made those choices by themselves and everyone should have a right to make an actual informed decision on if they want to go to the wedding or not, which they now have the ability to do. Therapy is great but also we need to be able to truly process all of our emotions before therapy helps, if you want to be angry get your anger out, if you want to be sad, be sad then you can go in with okay I\u2019ve felt how I need to feel and im ready to move forward now.

Find a new family.", "I am sorry that your aunt feels like this but at least she has someone who will hopefully lead her to see the truth about your father and that you can reconnect later.

Stay strong. You are NTA here.", "Brava.  Time does not diminish what they did, and they know it.  Otherwise, everyone would have known about the affair already and Dad and AP would have apologized to the world for their despicable actions.

If they had left well enough alone or at the very least didn't escalate outside of You, your aunt and sperm donor, their secret would have remained intacted. AP is really a piece of work, blaming you. Maybe send two black roses to the reception", "NTA but your dad definitely is a major AH! Infidelity is already an atrocious thing but doing it while your wife is going through the roughest time of her life (aka the time where she need your love the most) is as low as a human being can go!

Their affair thrives in darkness and you brought that shit into the light. Now they FINALLY get to face some real consequences.   \n\n\nWhat your dad did has no name and I would totally cut him (and anyone that enabled him) for good. Congrats for sticking to your guns. I'm sorry about your aunt, I can't believe how quickly she forgot of all the hurt your dad caused, and how she betrayed your trust.", "> the affair partner threatened to leave him if he did that.\n\nwow, 'affair partner' sounds like a real 'catch'.

You\u2019ve managed to get through life without your dad up to this point so why mess with what\u2019s working?

Instead they wanted to pretend it's one big happy family. OP wasn't going to blow up their spot until they kept poking the bear. I wonder how many people do end up coming to this wedding.

They'll do that on their own...\n\nGood luck and take care of yourself.", "Take joy in imagining how awkward and awful the wedding will be, the weirdly empty rows (if in a church) the gaps in people present. How speeches will have to be edited to remove all the people banned. I bet the bride will be miserable, stuck in her own head wondering if this person or that is thinking about the drama.", "Oh!

Your dad and AP are official pariahs!", "Absurd way to ruin the wedding: get a gorgeous 20ish years old in mourning clothes (even better if they look heavily pregnant) to be at the church and start crying loudly during the ceremony.", "I'm surprised that your dad is still going to go through with it, after she has threatened to leave if he postpones the wedding...he should have taken her up on the offer,but he can't see past the end of his willy, apparently.", "OP, you're NTA. I hope you know that. I have no idea how your aunt has turned this situation into being your fault. Your girlfriend sounds like a hoot! Here's a fun idea to ruin the wedding (if no one has beaten me to it) you two show up dressed to the nines and saunter around the reception planting little seeds like ... The bride should be wearing a scarlet letter ... I hope the bride doesn't ever face breast cancer! you know how he did his first wife don't you? Oh, this won't last long, they're both cheaters. Conversely, get dressed to the nines and go out just the two of you and celebrate your mom. Your best revenge will be you and GF making an awesome life together!", "Well if the AP somehow does contact OP then all they have to do is tell AP that you hope she has a long and healthy life because if she ever got sick she can rest assured that dad will already have someone else lined up to take her place before she\u2019s even buried. It\u2019s ruthless yes but let\u2019s face the facts that that is exactly what OPs dad did so why not leave with that.", "Your aunt's fianc\u00e9 seems pretty solid.

I did the carer part for my Mom, too - parents were already divorced, so I didn\u2019t have THAT to deal with - but the long, slow goodbye just about killed me, losing her a bit at a time. That they would put you through this while you\u2019re still reeling is just monstrous. I\u2019m SO sorry. Shop a shrink (it can take a while to find the right one) and find some peace. In case you were wondering, NOT TA, good god. The family though - what horrible people.", "Fianc\u00e9 dude is chill af, hope he doesn't marry your garbage aunt", "It\u2019s crazy how people can project their own guilt on someone that has zero hand in it all. You were a child when your father was having an affair on your dying mother.. and it\u2019s YOUR fault that his family is just now finding out the harsh truth and having opinions about it? That\u2019s disgusting behavior. And the fact the reason this all started was \u201cIt would look bad to the family if you weren\u2019t there\u201d THEY BOTH KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS WRONG. How long did they think this secret would stay a secret? Also, the fact the affair partner is threatening to not go through with the wedding because HIS family and his dead ex wife\u2019s FRIENDS now dislike her is WILD and she doesn\u2019t think she did anything wrong, somehow? I\u2019m sorry your family is like this OP and I\u2019m glad you have a supportive girlfriend to help cheer you up a bit in this hard time. I can\u2019t imagine how you feel, but I personally think you are doing right by you and your mom.

And it is weird that your aunt went along with such a rationalization.  I would check the disconnected number for the family that support you based on finally knowing the truth, but that is me.  You have lived for 8 years without these people, and while therapy will be good you clearly don't need any of them.", "i definitely would attend just to answer the, is there any reason why these 2 should not be wed, question.", "Not everything is always black and white.

His parents were on the verge of divorcing when she got diagnosed. In order to spare her the ordeal of a divorce they did not legally split.\n\nOf course she blamed everything on the husband. Worse they were divorcing because she had cheated first. All his mom's family knew and lied to him for years. His older sibling knew and that's why he had taken his dad side.\n\nYou should check when and why your dad shackled with his new woman. From your timeline it sound like it started before your mom got diagnosed. Your dad may still be a cheating bastard, but it is possible he had already checked out of the marriage before your mom's cancer.", "Non of this was your fault, this was all their own doing, it seems based on the reactions of other friends and family members you weren\u2019t the only one they were deceiving with their relationship. If they didn\u2019t want it out there then they shouldn\u2019t have messed around!\n\nI would stay in contact with those that sided with you and are in your corner, sounds like you have some family and friends or should I say former friends of your parents with a moral compass!", "Your father was an ash for cheating on your mother. From the time line in your first post, he had started the affair before your mother was diagnosed. He and his ap seem evil, but maybe your father stayed in the marriage because your family needed him there, while he loved an other person and if cancer hadn't hit he would have asked for a divorce. People divorce frequently and many times cheating is a symptom and not  the cause of the distinction of the marriage. \n   You have the right to grieve for the loss of your mother, what she went through, and for the loss of your family.

She married R. They both had been married and had kids before. Together they had more kids.Lots of kids in that family. But R was the kind of man who needed someone, usually  a woman, to take care of him, both physically and emotionally and socially .. \n\nThe friend group didn't always  think highly of him for that, but he was J's choice and he was a personable guy so we respected her choice.\n\nJ got breast cancer and got progressively more sick. She lingered. It was rough . In all of that, it was increasingly apparent that R was  untethered, emotionally floundering. The kids took over much of the household stuff, but R needed increasing attention .\n\nR started seeking attention and solace from the friend group- there were no affairs that I knew of ( and I am pretty sure that I would have had an inkling if there were). In retrospect he was probably mourning her loss before she died. We saw anger and denial and , yes, withdrawal, by doing more of his outside activities and work.\n\nMedical people and the friend group and extended family were there for J, but R hovered around the edge. Untethered.\n\nJ passed.\n\nThree years later R remarried to a woman he had become friends with while J was sick.\n\nAt least two of the kids have cut ties with the family because they saw R as being disloyal to J.It has been over 15 years now. It's sad .\n\nTake away point:Some people can be selfless up to a point and then they too need support and attention; cancer care needs to be for more than the one with the  illness.", "Good luck OP!

Your response was perfect.  I wish for you a happy life!", "So sorry you had to go through that, OP. And I feel like the biggest act of betrayal comes from your aunt. Yes, your dad was a major betrayer too, but your aunt took you in, she knew what had happened and was supposedly on your side then she tries to guilt you into going to the wedding because appearances? Giving out your number and recruiting family members and friends to harass you into going to the wedding? That's just sick behavior coming from someone you thought you could trust. The aunt's fianc\u00e9 is the hero, it was great he came to tell you the truth, but it sucks he has to be cut off too because he's with your aunt. Maybe if he decides to dump her one day you can be friends. He should be wary about wanting to marry her seeing how she acted towards you anyway.", "NTA.
