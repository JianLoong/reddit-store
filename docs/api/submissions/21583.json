Not for being upset that your daughter did something stupid, getting drunk at 15 is majorly stupid and dangerous. You\u2019re the AH because your daughter is not an adult who can be trusted to make the best decision and think rationally, she\u2019s a teenager and it\u2019s just a fact that her brain isn\u2019t developed enough for you to foist your responsibilities as a parent onto her. You need to rethink your parenting style which is going to be hard because teens also will push boundaries and I suspect it will be worse if she didn\u2019t have many before. You also need to take seriously the reasons she gave you for drinking, they absolutely don\u2019t excuse it but a cry for help is a cry for help. It seems that you maybe need to take a more active role in your daughter\u2019s life, use this as a wake-up call.", "Look, you\u2019re a parent, and your kid did something incredibly stupid, like all kids do at least once. And like any parent, you overreacted to this one. Now that it\u2019s over, take a deep breath and tell her it\u2019s time to sit down and have a conversation. No accusations, no yelling just to talk about where you go from here. Start with, \u201cwhat I heard you say is that you are sad and unhappy about your weight, how can I help you with that\u201d. Set up an appointment with her physician. Is there some thing you and she can do together to increase her activity? Going to the gym or bike riding? Does she like to cook? Perhaps you and she can do some research on healthy eating. Sometimes there are local classes for learning to cook if that\u2019s some thing she might be interested in. Maybe you need to set up a counseling session for her. You need to show her you are  taking her comments seriously and you need to set an example for her.", "YTA. Woof, you messed up.\n\n1. 15 is a kid, don't treat her like an adult because she's not. Kids have different needs than adults so you aren't relating well to her.\n2. \"I trusted her to be able to use basic common sense and think things through rationally.\"  I mean, she's a teen so that's dumb of you.\n3. She clearly knew what she did was wrong but you wanted to keep telling her what she knew - aside from you feeling better, what did that accomplish?\n\nThose things aside, here's where you blew it as a father: she's clearly struggling and was vulnerable and instead of leaning into it and giving her some support, you yelled. Nope, drinking isn't a good coping mechanism and neither is talking to you about her worries.\n\nYou just showed her to not come to you about issues. That's not s guilt trip, that's a result of your actions and words.", "YTA. yes your kid escalated but you need to stop treating your CHILD like an adult and I doubt you can go back because what's done is done. She messes up once a lecture happens but your kids got more going on than her one night of getting drunk", "YTA - she\u2019d already accepted what she did was stupid before you yelled, so you had no reason to yell. When she confided in you that she was struggling you decided to treat that as her tying to guilt trip you and reacted horribly too it. This was an occasion where you really needed to use a gentle touch. Plus your comments about how she\u2019s been keeping herself in her room and eating as a coping mechanism shows pretty clearly she wasn\u2019t guilt tripping you she was giving you a truthful explanation as to why she did what she did.", "NTA - she's trying to manipulate you by claiming that you were yelling at her for being fat when both of you know it was about the drinking.\n\nHowever I think once things have cooled off you should sit down and have a real talk about drinking and peer pressure and the bad things that could happen if she gets that drunk.\n\nAlso if she is this worried about her weight, are you doing anything to help her with it? Start cooking healthier and stop buying junk food. Offer to work out with her? How much does she know about how to lose weight since she clearly wants to? It's still early enough in her life that she could learn good lifelong habits. Ask her more about what's causing her to overeat. Maybe get her a therapist if that's financially possible. Let her know you're committed to help her change if it's bothering her this much. If you're both overweight, maybe you could both commit to getting healthier this summer together.\n\nIf I can give one single tip about weight loss, cut out all the drinks with sugar in them. My wife used to be obese her whole life and she cut out soda and she lost 60 pounds just from that alone. That inspired her to keep going and she ended up losing 120 pounds and getting super fit. It all started with one small change.\n\nOh one other thing help her find a form of exercise that she likes. Try to think outside the box...it doesn't have to be an organized sport. Even playing active video games or hiking or honestly just walking.", "NTA But I hope you stop treating her like an adult and give her some real consequences. My parents would\u2019ve been LIVID if I had come home wasted at only 15. I would\u2019ve been grounded for like a month.", "NTA\n\nYou were yelling at her because of what she did, not her weight.\n\nIdeally, I think you should have been a bit nicer when she mentioned her insecurity about weight gain. Sure it could have been a guilt trip but what if it wasn't? If my father had yelled at me after I said something like that I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing insecurities with him.\n\nYou said you are a single parent, does she have a female parental figure in her life? For girls issues like weight are hard to talk about, especially to someone who isn't another female. There is a huge standard for girls to have concerningly low weights and most males wouldn't be able to empathize or understand that. She may have not gone to you because of that, it's not as easy as just going and telling you. \n\nReassure her that you love her but she will still be disciplined her missing curfew and drinking underage. Let her know this is out of love and you are just concerned for her well-being. Then you can both work on making a new diet plan or exercise regimen to help her healthily lose weight.", "NTA.\n\nWhen a fifteen year old shows up wasted at 1:30 in the morning, words need to be had.", "NTA. This is worth a calm discussion with her about alcohol poisoning and to an extent *holding your liquor*. Kids do not understand their tolerance and can end up getting their stomach pumped or worse. You may get further with the *holding your liquor* approach bc not doing so incurs social embarrassment. Never drink on an empty stomach, don\u2019t continuously drink for hours on end, drink water and if necessary (due to social pressure) fake doing that shot. Ik it sounds wrong but sometimes faking having alcohol is the easiest strategy until you can exit the situation. \n\nMy ex didn\u2019t like the way alcohol made him feel but he would hold a beer to prevent everyone from trying to feed him drinks. \n\nSorry you\u2019re going through this. It\u2019s terrifying imagining how vulnerable kids are when they\u2019re drinking.", "NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that when you give a 15 year old freedom, she will push the boundaries. I would recommend she speak to a therapist to get professional advice in her health concerns.", "I guess NTA. However, I think yelling doesn't help. I would talk to her about the fact that it is also dangerous 1. Healthwise and 2. You never know who is out there seeing her drunk etc. However, I would also tell her that you rather have her call you and come to you then anything else even if she is drunk or makes mistakes. That you want her to be save. Now the other issues. Yes, you to should figure out a plan about school and the stress. Along with this the weight gain. Honestly working out is a good stress relieve as well as can reduce the weight gain and strengthen her all around. I would talk to her about how you to could do something together like go hiking, go swimming, play tennis etc. And/or you could also go to the gym. And maybe also cook together and try to eat balanced.", "NTA, but yelling was not the solution. When you've both calmed down, sit her down and talk to her about the dangers of drinking to cope with problems, and then make an appointment with her Primary care doctor so that \n\n1) she can discuss how she had been coping with stress (food), and get recommendations for a therapist so that she can develop better coping mechanisms and \n\n2) she can discuss the weight gain and what the best ways to SAFELY lose weight would be for her. \n\nYou don't want to be an AH by writing off her concerns/problems (the potential depression, the weight gain, poor coping mechanisms, etc.) So you need to take addressing them in a healthy manner seriously. But...she's also a kid. Ground her and make her write an essay about what she did wrong and what better choices she could have made, and what she'd do if faced with a similar situation in the future. Make her think about the mistakes/consequences, but don't be so harsh that she becomes afraid to talk to you about serious things.", "NTA, \n\nYelling was not going to help at all and I am sure it did not help.  You both probably didn\u2019t hear each over. Above all the yelling, but I get your frustration as a concerned parent.  So many things could have happened to her and I am sure they were all racing through your mind.\n\nHowever, how did she get home?  Did she get in the car with another shit faced person who drove. \n\nYour daughter has some serious judgment and accountability issues.\n\nI agree with everyone that her excuses are deflection tactics to manipulate to get sympathy and out of trouble.\n\n\nShe may very well have insecurities about her weight, but that\u2019s not an excuse to get shit faced, drink illegally, and avoid accountability", "NTA - sounds like you were just being a parent and being yelled at midst a hangover is a pretty goot deterrent to not drink like that again", "NTA\n\nYelling is not the best parenting, but, considering how hungover she probably was, it probably had an added effect. If she wants to be treated more like an adult, then she needs to recognize that you yelling is consequence of your own unchecked fears/concerns/emotions over her poor behavior.  Again, yelling is not the best option, but it is an understandable response.\n\nMy recommendation if it happens again or if she is out past curfew:  wake her up at 6am and put her to work doing chores around the house.  Her behavior left you with less sleep, and I am guessing your response was not to shirk your responsibilities and sleep until noon.  It's a life-lesson to learn.", "NTA. Great parenting is rare nowadays but you're doing a good job. Your daughter sounds like she's trying to make you pity her just so you shut up about her misbehaving. Scolding her is not wrong...it's PARENTING. Just don't over do it though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Drinking contributes to weight gain. You should always be aware of where your daughter is and she should be telling you where she's going ahead of time. She still needs guidance at 15 along with some expectations of her behavior is to be when you're not around, since she's being treated like an adult for the most part. Even adults let people know their whereabouts. Why is she in places where no one is paying attention to underaged drinking?

A 15 year old does have common sense. however, she is 15, so her decision-making skills are going to be questionable because her brain is still developing.

NTA y\u2019all are soft.", "YTA-\n\nyour daughter is 15, not an adult. you didn\u2019t even ask where she was going, i would say that\u2019s pretty short sighted and reckless of you (the adult). to then berate her when she\u2019s immediately owned up, and then dismissed her clear attempt at having an open conversation about her mental health as a guilt trip?? \nyou need to reconnect with your child. stop acting like she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA as long as you let her hangover dissipate and then have a proper chat with her.\n\nDefinitely tell her, from personal experience, the reason a lot of people are fat is due to booze. I'm a vegetarian, fairly active (less so when with a crappy ex up until Jan but back to moving around) but way fatter than I should be due to booze. When I take a month off, I lose like half a stone without changing anything else. It's all hollow calories, makes you crave comfort food and the sugar isn't the one.\n\nAsk her if she's really concerned about her weight and ask how you can support her. Maybe walking together on an evening or preparing some food together.\n\nShe might be full of it and using it as an excuse, but she also may not be and is at an age where making her feel bad will only alienate her further.\n\nIf she broke curfew and was drinking to that state at her age, it's fair if she isn't allowed out for a bit, but be the dad she needs to help her navigate all of this stuff instead of a pure disciplinarian.\n\nGood luck! You sound like you're working hard to be a great dad, so I'm sure it'll work out fine \ud83d\udda4", "NTA and tell her drinking causes her to gain weight.", "NTA what's the difference between 15 and 18 years old when you are legally declared an adult when i was 15 i knew what was right and what was wrong. You don't need a parent to tell you that and being insecure about weight isn't an excuse to get piss drunk. If you are insecure about your weight then better yourself instead of making excuses and using alcohol as a coping mechanism which makes you gain more weight if anything.", "YTA. 15 is not an adult and you should not treat her like one. Yelling at her is, imho, childish. This is when you parent her, not whatever the crap this was", "YTA there was absolutely no reason to yell, and you are a MAJOR AH for assuming she\u2019s \u201cguilt tripping\u201d you when she trusts and confides in you issues she is dealing with.", "YTA - she wasn\u2019t trying to manipulate you. She was trying to open up about her struggles as a teenage girl. Honestly its awful you thought that of her.", "YTA. My parents always had alcohol around and let us have a bit when we wanted. My brother and I rarely got drunk compared to our friends, cause we were just used to it and it wasn't some forbidden fruit. But still once or twice we came home drunk and our parents treated us with kindness which was always very appreciated. \n\nShe's talking to you in a very vulnerable way. She's clearly going through a hard time. Expecting a teenager to act as an adult is idiotic on your end. Sometimes she's going to make mistakes.", "Ok so I understand why you were upset and that's completely reasonable,my parents would've done that but you also have to understand that bot everything is a guilt trip. I get that she felt sad about it, and it could've been an actual reason. Just try to remember she's still experiencing everything for the first bit of her life", "I can\u2019t even address whether or not you\u2019re the AH because I got stuck on your not knowing where your 15-year old was going at night. Then, when she got home drunk, you left her to sleep it off. So, I feel you are both quite lucky that she remained alive. She actually needed to be placed in the recovery position and someone needed to monitor her breathing and ensure she didn\u2019t aspirate vomit in her sleep. It really isn\u2019t rare for young teens to die from aspiration or alcohol poisoning. A trip to the Emergency room would have been a good decision. Sorry. I\u2019m not judging, just worried.", "NTA, 15 yr olds have no business drinking alcohol", "Wtf were you doing between 11pm and 1:30am? \n\nAnd when she talked about weight, you should have kept the conversation about drinking and missing curfew and said you\u2019d talk about her weight concerns when you were both calm. \n\nYou missed the boat and need to change up your parenting, that\u2019s for sure.", "Nta. She\u2019s trying to guilt you to stay out of punishment", "YTA. She's not an adult.\n\nShe's a teenager not an adult.", "This is great insight. Try taking with her again and discussing her insecurities in a safe space. She\u2019ll definitely find value there, when you\u2019re compassionate.", "Reiterating til this point is driven in\u2014 my parents said that to me, my aunts did as well in case I didn\u2019t want to call my parents. It doesn\u2019t enable drinking, but if they do it does mean someone doesn\u2019t die due to reckless driving.", "To be fair, they\u2019re American judging from the 4th of July thing so it\u2019s not like for us where you can just go to the doctor (even if the wait lists are long)- you have to consider the cost. Therapy might be too expensive for a single parent over there so I can understand him being reluctant to spend money on something he doesn\u2019t feel is necessary (even though I think he\u2019s wrong)", "Really, you thought he started calling too *early*? I thought he started too *late*. If I had to be home at a certain time that also came with the \u201con my way\u201d text beforehand- if it got to maybe 15 minutes before I was due home and I hadn\u2019t let my mum know I was on my way, she\u2019d try and get hold of me to check everything was ok.", "Not a 15 year old- an adult, according to OP and the way he treats her.", "Unfortunately you may have already shut down the idea in her head that _you_ would be in anyway helpful or understanding of how she feels, it might be good to get a therapist involved.", "So you claim to treat her as an adult (even though she isn't)?\n\nWe treat adults as if what they say is what they mean. We believe adults when they express how they are feeling without second guessing. We do not assume an adult explaining a very personal problem is doing it just to guilt us.\n\nYour daughter is crying out for help and you are making it all about yourself. Of course she doesn't want to talk with you about it after she tried to open up to you and you shat all over her.\n\nStep up and actually parent.\n\nGet her an appointment with a doctor, a therapist, and a licensed dietitian.", "Considering the last time she tried to talk to you about it you yelled at her are you honestly surprised? You're going to have to rebuild trust before she will be willing to talk to you about that now.", "No shit. You yelled at her when she tried to open up about it, why would she trust you with something that personal and sensitive again?\n\nYTA and you are failing her. She is a child, not an adult. You need parenting classes, both of you need therapy, she needs a personal trainer and you need to get some expert nutrition guidance. If she\u2019s shading toward obese at 15 then whatever arrangements you\u2019re making around food are inadequate. If you fail to get support so you can feed your child properly you are medically neglecting her. Sort yourself out, this is unacceptable.", "Im American and go to therapy myself, I'm very familiar with that system. But when it comes to your daughters safety and mental health, I dont think you can be so frugal. Also, to add on, he seems to not believe that she has the self-esteem issue that she's telling him.\n\nI'm not trying to fight with you at all, just letting you know my general knowledge :)", "Your daughter is wrong for thinking your mad that she is fat absolutely but your wrong for thinking that self esteem issues can\u2019t cause substance abuse. Your daughter is clearly having trouble with herself so while yes punishing her for drinking is right you also need to get her into therapy. Her issues could lead to eating disorders or continued substance abuse.", "It's good that you treat her like an adult, to a point. This is where the line is drawn because when she screws up you have to remember she's not your peer, she's still a child who is learning how to deal with life, feelings, emotions and the world around her. You're her dad and supposed to be her safe place. Yelling doesn't get anyone anywhere. There should absolutely be consequences AFTER everything is worked out.\n\nYTA for yelling at her when she was vulnerable. Not for being worried, mad or upset about her drinking."]}
