A lot of it is because of my sister. She's 2 years younger than me and we've always had an up and down relationship. When she wants something she's really sweet and tells me I'm the best brother ever. But she also does things that make me dislike her. She outed me two years ago for starters. Then she decided to snoop and find out stuff about my boyfriend when I told her to drop it. When she got into trouble for the latter (she did for both but the punishment for the latter bothered her way more) she told me I was dumb, called me a couple of slurs and said I was a shitty brother and wanting respect for mine and my boyfriend's privacy was dumb. We went on vacation in June and while there I became so done with her. She started taunting me about how my boyfriend was going to cheat on me because he's bi, she said that he'll never love me and how pathetic I must look to his girlfriend to be with him after two years when clearly he'll just want to be with a girl when he moves. I told her to stop. I warned her she was crossing into territory she didn't want to walk into. So the second to last night there was a lot of tension and our parents were trying to get her to apologize when she told me she was going to get my boyfriend to sleep with her and that would show me, and then I would need to apologize to her. I told her IF she were able to do that and if she stooped that low that she would no longer be my sister, that I would find her even more repulsive than I already did at that point. She was very smug and I told her I did not love her more than I loved myself and I would never allow someone so twisted to be in my life if they were willing to sleep with someone I loved just to show me.\n\nMy parents got her to apologize again but when a month had passed and I hadn't forgiven her they went on to say I could not hold a grudge forever and she's 16 and she's being dumb but at some point our relationship has to be more important. I told them she and I would never be the same again.\n\nMy sister got to choose the family vacation spot next summer (I chose the one this year) and while my family were talking about it I told them I wouldn't be going. My sister looked completely shocked and my parents were asking me what I was talking about. I told them I was done with my sister, that I have no interest in playing happy families anymore and the vacation will be just the three of them from now on and even if this was supposed to be my last family vacation with them, I decided it had already happened. My parents told me I was taking things too far. I told them I couldn't even look at her anymore let alone spend a week up close with her. She apologized a lot more genuinely a couple of days ago and begged me to come. She said she doesn't want to lose me and that she wants me on vacation with them. I said no. She was very upset.

Btw, you talked to your boyfriend about what your sister told you right?", "NTA.  As soon as you said she outed you, that was all I needed to know.  She\u2019s 16, not a little kid.  And the rest of what she said?  Hell no.  At her age she knows she\u2019s saying ugly things and she sounds like she enjoyed tormenting you - that\u2019s not what decent people do.

Your sister has attacked you in every possible psychological way, and playing happy famileeee isn\u2019t a price you owe parents who couldn\u2019t shut the noise TF up.", "NTA - You're old enough to decide this, but make sure you're willing to pay whatever price may come with alienating your parents. Take stock of what you rely on them for in terms of housing, living expenses, educational expenses, and so forth. If they aren't providing much on that front or you have a plan to not need them, go forth without your sister's nonsense forevermore. Otherwise you might need to think about sucking it up enough to keep the college tuition checks (or whatever) flowing. Good luck! She sounds like a piece of work that isn't used to facing real consequences for her awful actions.", "NTA - Your sister is in the realm of FAAFO and your parents are weak limp noodles.", "NTA.  Your sister crossed a line that's inexcusable.  Other than making her say she's sorry - did your parents do anything?  Was she punished, grounded, or something else?  Doesn't sound like it.  As bad as your sister behaved, it sounds like your parents are not far behind her.  This type of racist, bullying behavior needs to not just be stopped, but slammed shut.\n\nThis doesn't go away by your parents telling her - Oh that wasn't nice, now go say your sorry to your brother.  Something like this can take years - if not forever - for OP to forgive.\n\nYour sister ruined the family vacation - OP didn't.  OP - 6 months to go to graduation.  Save your money and get out of there after you graduate.", "Your sister is despicable . You are within your rights to not be near her. Family is supposed to have your back and love you. Your parents need to be more supportive and get your sister volunteered in programs for the LGBQ community and counseling. She truly sounds bazaar. My Uncle was married to my Uncle Rob until he passed . You deserve the best and you sister needs to live the consequences for her actions", "NTA. Tell your family you have to see a change in your sister, not just hear words. That will take a lot of time. She has said some dreadful things to you.  At some point you sister needs to decide your relationship is more important, not you. She's the one who blew it up.", "NTA and is your sister in therapy, this is behavior is extreme. Good luck on moving out and definitely go LC for a while, you need a big break from her.", "Why would your parents want you to hang out with someone like your sister? They should hire her a babysitter and she can stay home and you and your parents can go to the destination she chose. Or no one goes.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds unwell and delusional.", "NTA - the only A in this story is your sister.  And she would have to do way more than appologise, if she wants to be close to you again. Trust is earned, not a given. Just because you're siblings, doesn't mean you have to be tight- knit", "I mean, there's a whole lot of homophobia/bi-erasure going on here on top of her being unhinged and jealous. Her taunting very much reads as \"this is just a phase, he only needs to find the right girl and settle down.\" The fact that she, as a 16yo girl, even considered seducing her older brother's boyfriend and then expects him to apologize \\*to her\\* after she proves herself right is extremely concerning and exactly the kind of mentality that could end in sexual assault.", "Agreed to all this! \n\nI hope Op can talk to his parents about this and that his sister gets the help she needs! \n\nNTA", "It seems like this sub simultaneously decided Boys will be boys is comoletely toxic, but girls will be girls is a-okay.", "Your parents are mad at you. That's way your sister is messed up. Never held accountable for her behaviour.", "WTF. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA  \nStart proactively recording any conversations she attempts to start if you're alone with her.  The only use for those will be to protect you if she tries to make trouble for you.   \nShe isn't worth the effort otherwise.   \nYou have already pointed out her behavior to your parents. There is no need to belabor or pile up evidence.   \nTry to not punish your parents unnecessarily. They love both of you.   \nLook up the *grey rock method* of dealing with abusive and manipulative people. This isn't just not talking to your sister.   \nThere will be plenty of time to go full NC with her, after you move out. \n\nAccept that some people you meet later in life - will not understand your choice.   \nAccept that someone will eventually blindside you, thinking that they are doing you a favor or just that they know what's best for you.   \nIF you must have a discussion about the situation, don't go into details. If people persist just ask the inquiring party to consider how bad the situation had become to prompt this choice.  \n\nThe best revenge on bad people is simply your being happy with life.", "NTA...this is beyond an apology.", "NTA\n\nTell her to call you when she's 18 and you'll see how she's grown up.\n\nBe done with the child.", "NTA. I'm proud of you for realizing at such a young age that you don't have to put up with being abused regardless of who is doing it. \n\nShe doesn't get a free pass because she's underage. Nor do your parents get to pretend that there are no problems here.\n\nThis is a good wake up call for your family.\n\nBe strong and follow through. Try to find  roommate/s maybe you can move out sooner.", "Your sister sounds dreadful and has definitely lost the FAFO game.  I can hold a grudge for a long time, so trust me it can be done. Maybe one day she\u2019ll grow up and realize what she\u2019s lost and try to make amends. But for now\u2026. she gone. NTA", "I'd wager the 'genuine' apology is more likely to be motivated by a. fear she might actually get punished for something for once in her life and b. the possibility of the vacation being cancelled", "Agreed. 16 year olds know what they\u2019re saying and have usually had romantic relationships, her comments were incredibly cruel. An apology isn\u2019t enough, if I were OP I\u2019d want to know where that anger came from before restarting a relationship.", "NTA. I totally agree with you. So many here on Reddit make those exact same statements.  If people are never called out in their behavior, things with them never change. Their other famous saying is always \u201c you were being to harsh\u201d or \u201c you should have said it more gently or better\u201d no matter what the person was subjected to."]}
