But you didn\u2019t even do the bare minimum with that!\n\nYou just wanted to show off your oc which is like? This is not the time or place and you tried to make your coworker\u2019s special banner about you.\n\nDo they not pay you enough to get a little pad of paper from dollar tree or something where you can draw your oc without bothering anyone? Like? This is just incomprehensible behavior to me.", "\"there's a time and a place for everything..\" YTA this wasn't the time or the place\n\nEdit for spelling", "Right? Like who was this drawing for. Even if she were a fan of Kingdom Hearts she didn\u2019t know OP well enough for this OC to mean anything.", "OP made her retirement banner all about themselves , instead of wishes for the lady retiring. If OP Must draw, then it should be something that the lady is known to like. This is not the place to show off your skills with a vague character that very few ppl will know. What is she supposed to think when she see that everyday ? How some asshole made it about himself.", "Seriously, I drew a Pok\u00e9mon on a friend\u2019s going away board once but it was literally an in joke in reference to his massive love of the games and a convo I had with him and his wife when we hung out.", "OP - do you completely lack, or struggle with, social skills? The whole purpose was to leave a message to the woman who\u2019s retiring. It\u2019s not a piece of paper you can scribble on for fun but should either say something that has a meaning to the person it\u2019s for or just wishing her well. \n\nWhy do you think that it was a good idea to draw an OC. What does that have to do with the retiree? There\u2019s a whole world outside that doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Try for a second to care about other people.", "Ding ding ding! \"You just drew something you felt like drawing.\" If it were a crowd-pleaser subject matter like a dog, cat, heart, flower...great! Something that a lady of retirement age might find pleasant.\n\nOP chose their subject matter like it was an unimportant page of an unimportant year's yearbook. Entirely for their own enjoyment, not hers.", "Nah I feel like OP takes opportunities to make things that are about other ppl about himself instead", "Their drawing was 5 Inches tall according to the OP.", "They draw a 5 inch tall drawing of their own character from an anime on a banner of someone they barely know for their retirement. That\u2019s not okay.", "Barf", "Yeah, that's my take too. \n\nI am a doodler, and I never know what to write on this sort of thing, so I often draw little pictures, but they are relevant to the person or the situation (i.e. a birthday cake, etc.). I'm also not sure I'd do this on a banner, especially if it were a place where people were just writing names.\n\nTBF, I think the white-out was a weird response, though.", "I feel like no matter how artistic you are, sometimes you should just hold it in. At my last job we did birthday cards for everyone  and there was this guy that always drew something. Usually people didn\u2019t mind, but sometimes the drawing took up most of the card and everyone that writes well wishes after him have to cram tiny writing into limited space. People started circulating the card to him last and the he\u2019d complain he\u2019d have no space for his drawings. Like read the room dude, the drawings are why you get the card last!", "A finely detailed flower for a lady would be extremely thoughtful.  They did draw something they felt a strong need to draw and it was totally irrelevant.", "So, anyone with a kick of sense wouldn't draw some character that they made up on a momento for someone else.  They ended up making the banner about them.", "YES, strong r/IAmTheMaInCharacter vibes! YTA OP.", "A \u201cfriend\u201d\u2019of mine once stole a pillow from a hotel, justifying it thusly: 1-She left her prescription goggles in the pool area and couldn\u2019t retrieve them, so they \u201cowed\u201d her; 2-there wasn\u2019t a sign that said do not steal pillows.  \n\nBetween that, and her insistence on telling me her opinion of Obama literally seconds after I said I only wanted to hang out if we kept politics out of it, our friendship ended.", "Thanks for the laugh. This is exactly the sort of thing I think of when someone says they created an OC.", "Nah they were just trying to make the retirement about themselves lol", "Bro who cares about a fucking retirement banner??", "I'm a decent singer, but friggin' HATE it when people sing Happy Birthday to other people in a group like they're trying out for The Voice.", "Which is weird, because they were simply expressing themselves through their white-out artwork!", "In Australia you sometimes do see a sign in public toilets advising \u2018non potable water, do not drink\u2019.  Well\u2026\u2026I wasn\u2019t going to but thanks, I guess?  Sorry, off topic I know, I just still think it\u2019s funny", "I\u2019m looking forward to my broth day :)", "Welcome, though I'm kicking myself for forgetting the part where she and the whole cast attend a Japanese high school in between fighting the Heartless (and the principal is secretly Xehanort but no one realizes it yet).", "Oh god talk about 0 social awareness", "I hope he drew smroofy. A sexy she goofy battle mage.", "You didn't do it on something that was going to be presented to someone as a gift either.", "Yeah, see: cats, dogs, frogs...all crowd-pleaser drawings!! No one is going to say \"I hate cute cartoon frogs.\" These are nice, neutral choices.\n\nThey are not a specific anime OC based on a niche franchise.", "You still owe me an apology. I told you about my frog-phobia!!!", "I'm going to use this in the future .....", "Bro this is what I tought too, impressed by all the ah\u2019s here", "Nobody wants a 5 inch drawing of a non existent character from media they don\u2019t know on their banner, I promise.", "Me too! The pro musicians are the worst! Like I know you studied to become a professional opera singer, but we really don\u2019t need a performance at every single family event.", "Batman is so widely known globally that I would take it as a criticism of my artistic ability if someone had to ask me what the drawing was supposed to be. \n\n\nDoubly so if they asked me what I was drawing, instead of why I was drawing a bat."]}
