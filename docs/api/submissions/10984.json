That\u2019s so weird.", "Right. This is something I would see myself doing in middle school where I drew anime characters on everything, even where it didn\u2019t make sense to (like for a relatives birthday card or something who never even heard of anime) and with time I became aware that it\u2019s not appropriate to draw anime characters every single time I drew anything for anyone. If OP is an artist, they could have just drawn like\u2026 a really realistic flower or something if they felt the strong need to draw.", "Yeah, like\u2026 \n\nWhy, OP? What were you thinking? It\u2019d be one thing if she liked flowers or puppies or something and you drew one on there. I attempted a little Gibbs from NCIS for a coworker of mine who retired but I asked before I did it and I knew she loved that show.\n\nThis isn\u2019t and wasn\u2019t about you, OP.", "This", "OP made this about Themselves. They saw an opportunity. They have artistic talent, by his own admission, of course. They don\u2019t really know the retiree, but they can draw on that banner! They just don\u2019t get what the problem is\u2026.. \n\nNarcissistic tendencies seem to raise their ugly heads when one posts on Reddit. \n\nOP, start your enlightenment journey today. Good luck with your edification and evolution.\n\nAgape \ud83d\udc95", "Having a shit day and \u201cBad Art Friend!\u201d cracked me up!", "I'm assuming there was a note saying not to wipe your arse on the banner, otherwise OP would've done that too.", "As others have correctly pointed out, OP suffers from main character syndrome.", "Even if that person was an avid fan, OP drawing their OC would still be very cringe and self-inserting. I love Kingdom Hearts, but that doesn\u2019t mean I care about Seraph, a mysterious loner who wields a special Keyblade (it\u2019s, like, super dark and only she can touch it without being corrupted). It was created from the rage in her heart when Sephiroth killed her parents, but she\u2019s learned to control it. Oh and unknown to her she\u2019s the 8th Princes of Heart, and she\u2019s also dating Riku.", "Personally I don\u2019t think this is that bad of a thing to do unless it literally ruined the rest of the banner. It might be a little awkward but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be more upset about a little drawing on a card or banner coworkers made for me than a generic note wishing me well.", "The only thing even remotely related to retirement in the game is the end of summer vacation symbolizing the end of the world. I doubt it had anything to do with her coworker\u2018s retirement.", "Someone old enough to retire likely has no idea what Kingdom of Hearts is. I know I don\u2019t; I had to look up what OC meant. What on earth were you thinking? If the co-worker had expressed any interest at all in your fanfic and artwork, you could have presented her with a drawing on paper.", "Uh no. OP made a going away gift to a coworker a showcase for their \"art\". The \"art\" had nothing to do with the coworker and everything to do with OP trying to be the center of attention.", "Southern baptist church is a wild comparison. I think OP\u2019s coworkers just wanted the focus of the banner to be on the woman who was retiring.", "If it was a specific character that also had some positive significance to the retiring coworker, or if the coworker had regularly said they liked OP's drawings, or if OP drew a flattering picture of the retiree, then it could be okay; without recipient-specific good context, though, not so much so.  From what OP posted, it didn't sound like OP even necessarily knew the retiring person at all, in which case a heart would also be weird.  \n\nSorry, OP, but I agree that YTA here.", "I wonder if OP drinks toilet water since there isn't a sign saying not to.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "What's that? I'm super curious", "If it\u2019s a little bitty on-theme drawing, sure - I sometimes draw people flowers on a card.  This is borderline because it\u2019s a niche interest of OP\u2019s - hence my request for more info.", "ROFL my drink came back out!", "Main character syndrome refers to identifying as the protagonist in your own life story. \n\nIn other words, everything is about you (OP) and your problems. It is a popular phrase to describe self centered people that don\u2019t care or pay any attention to anyone else around them. Previously described as \u201cthe world revolves around\u201d OP.", "Flowers would be cute on a card/banner and appropriate in most cases.", "The drawing was probably about 5 inches or so tall. I mean, it didn't take up much space on the banner, which was probably like 4-5 feet across.\n\nThe drawing was an alternate-reality version of Riku from Kingdom Hearts, I based it off this:  \nhttps://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Riku?file=Riku\\_%2528Art%2529\\_KHII.png", "That makes a lot of sense. I like the term used for it. \"Why wouldn't this NPC want me to scribble on their gift?! I'm the main character after all!\"", "No one cares what character from whatever niche interest it was based on. You only answered one of the several questions posed to you by the commenter asking for info. That\u2019s big enough, though, that it probably drew a lot of attention, so unless the answers to the other questions go something like, \u201cyes, this retiring coworker just loved my art and we had many a conversation about our love of anime,\u201d it was weird and making it about you, not her.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what the character was, only if this was a shared interest or inside joke that the retiree would appreciate.  And even if so, 5\u201d is way too big, that\u2019s attention-getting, not a little addition to your signature.", "Dude read the room. No one cares about your drawing or what it was based on. Why on earth would a woman who works in a different department than you so you likely don\u2019t even no each other that well, want some random weird anime drawing on their retirement banner? Make that make sense. I\u2019d be annoyed by your drawing too.", "But it had nothing to do with the coworker retiring. You made something about someone else all about you. You sound very immature if you need directions to be told not to draw on someone else\u2019s banner.
