{"id": 21375, "submission_id": "14qz13i", "title": "AITA for blocking off my yard and driveway?", "selftext": "For a bit of context, I have lived in my house for well over 12 years. It lies beside a busy intersection and is diagonal to a fairground which you can imagine is busy ALL THE TIME. My house sits on a hill which is best for watching fireworks, like today. In the past there has always been issues of people parking in our driveway or in the grass patch which sits between our driveway and the neighbors behind us. Beginning of this year we had gotten new neighbors, they decided to expand their driveway towards their backyard which lead to our loop of the driveway. We didn't care until they started constantly driving and parking in the middle grass patch which had resulted in them killing the grass. I have asked repeatedly to not drive in the grass and to not park their cars there and they've nodded and left. Come to find out that they don't even live there and are just regular visitors. I was tired of it so since today was the 4th of July I had put up a no parking sign and blocked off the grass with bricks. Not so surprisingly the neighbors had tried to squeeze 15 cars on their little lawn. They had asked us if we were the ones that put up the sign's and I said yes. They had given us a weird look and told us that it wasn't necessary. I simply shrugged and sat on my lawn. Throughout the firework show, the neighbors guests had tried to park around the driveway, at some point getting agitated over the fact our cars were blocking OUR driveway. They asked us repeatedly to remove the bricks so their guests can park and I simply said no. I guess they weren't happy with my answer since they kept calling me Karen and left beer cans in our grass. I am very annoyed by their disregard of other's properties.
