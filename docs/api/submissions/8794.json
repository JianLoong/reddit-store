I'm sorry, but this sounds like the behavior of a 13 year old, not a grown person.", "YTA.\n\nWTF your family is being super supportive and you just act like a 12 year old.", "YTA, but I think you know that. Nothing in your post describes unsupportive or asshole behavior from anyone else. You're taking your anger at your job out on your parents. It's okay to hate your job and maybe decide to move on to a different employer, but don't take out your anger on people who are, in fact, supporting you, which was evidenced by their multiple attempts to let you talk. (Not to mention, they are likely financially supporting you too since you can't afford to buy a home yet.)", "It sounds to me like they are extremely supportive - they asked you what was wrong and respected your decisions when you said you weren't ready / didn't want to talk about it. Then they checked in later and then it was too late. There seems to be no way to win for them here. On the flip side, I get hating your job and hating your circumstances, but there's no reason to go after the people who seem to be only there to support you instead of tearing you down.\n\nTL;DR: YTA", "YTA\n\nYour parents are being incredibly support in every way.\n\nI've told my teenage children that they're welcome to live with me as long as they need to, but if they're still at home and start carrying on like that in 10 years, I might change my mind.", "YTA\n\nYour family is being supportive. They have asked what is going on and you brush them off. What do you want them to do. Being a teacher is a tough profession and a lot of folks who are in it are burnt out. You sound incredibly unhappy. Have you considered therapy? Another profession? What steps can you take to make things better for you mentally. \n\nI'm sorry that things aren't great for you, but taking it out on your parents isn't okay.", "YTA. You\u2019re 27, you live with your parents, and they happily feed you and offer to talk to you about what\u2019s going on and that is unsupportive? If you hate your job go find a different one. I cry a lot and it\u2019s good to have that release but if you are having a chronic issue you gotta figure out a game plan", "WTF your behavior is worst than some teenagers. Jeez, you are old enough to understand plenty of things. It's not your parents fault you don't like that job, they are actually being supportive.\n\nMaybe you just take a vacation alone and go and find yourself. But you sound too spoiled as well. If your parents still treat you like a kid, is because you are acting like one.", "Yta, PMS isn't an excuse, and you're throwing everyone that menstruates under the bus. You have a chronic issue with your situation in life and are doing nothing to regulate your own adult-ass emotions. Your parents ARE being supportive, you're just being emotionally abusive because you feel like nothing is within your control. Do something else. Get therapy.", "YTA dumping your feelings onto others and blaming them for not doing better is just a reflection of how unhappy you are with yourself. They sound supportive. Find a new job. It might help since that seems the main stressor in your life.", "YTA. Do you think it's okay for your parents to be busy at work and then take it out on you? Oh, no, you don't? Then of course it isn't okay for you to do that either.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of anger and frustration about your situation in life. And that's understandable. But the ways you handle that are to either 1) do whatever you can to try to change your situation, or 2) talk to a therapist about coping mechanisms. You do not take it out on the people around you, especially at 27 years old.\n\nAlso, as a woman who gets periods, I have to tell you that having PMS is also not an excuse to act shitty towards others. It certainly can give you emotions beyond your control, which really sucks, but again, you have to work with a professional who can help you find ways to deal with these emotions that do not involve hurting others.", "YTA.  You are a full on adult and have been for years and years yet you live and act like a teenager.  Your parents are saints.", "YTA, you just said you are annoyed at the situation and took it out on someone else. You know it was wrong.

YTA and you should apologize.", "\"her work phone then rang- and she got tied up which annoyed me and after asked me if I\u2019m okay.

I also have a work phone and am on call 1/2 of the year, splitting duties with another coworker.\n\nYour parents seem very supportive, actually.  They gave you several opportunities to vent.  To communicate.  To get it off your chest.  It sounds like you may need some time with a trained professional.", "YTA and sound like a huge headache", "YTA.\n\nIf you think your parents paying your living expenses even though you are well into adulthood is not supportive enough, you might consider moving out and being responsible for yourself. That would show them.", "YTA\n\nYou sound totally draining. \n\nYour parents sound caring and supportive and you just sound difficult and disagreeable.", "YTA. You\u2019re old enough to know better than to take out your anger on others. It sounds like your parents are incredibly supportive. If you don\u2019t like your living and work situations, *change it*. Nobody can or should do it for you!", "YTA. \n\nYou kept saying you didn't want to talk, your parents respected that, and then you got upset with them for not talking to you. That's like something I would've done at 13 when my hormones were raging all over the place and I was just learning how to deal with grown-up emotions. And even at 13 - but *especially* at 27 - an apology for that behavior is the only decent response. \n\nFrom what your mom said in that third paragraph, I'm getting the sense that this happens with at least some regularity. \n\nIf you are regularly getting THIS upset and taking it out on your parents, then it seems possible that teaching is not the career for you, and perhaps it would be better to come up with a new life plan. \n\nBut after you go apologize, because that really does need to be the very next thing you do.", "yeah YTA here. Your parents actually sound very supportive. I get that it\u2019s frustrating being 27 and living at home and esp that it is soulrending to be a teacher, but you can\u2019t take that out on your family.", "Yeah, YTA. You've got two supportive parents and you took your anger out on them. Apologize", "YTA feel sorry for the people you teach and your parents.", "I feel like you know that YTA because your entire post consists of excuses and projection of how your parents felt", "You didn\u2019t come here for judgement, you came here to vent to strangers and beg for sympathy. News flash big girl \u2014 we ALL hate our jobs and cry about it at least once per month, but it takes a special kind of AH to take those emotions out on your parents who *checks notes* let you live in their home, eat their food, and offer you emotional support. \n\nThe economy sucks, the education system sucks, the housing crisis sucks, periods suck, etc etc etc but you gotta buckle in and figure that shit out dude. If you need a friend to cry to then go find one, but just wallowing in self pity and taking your anger out on your parents is a dick move, and quite frankly it\u2019s very immature. Grow up \u2014 learn a new skill or trade or whatever you need to do to pursue a career that doesn\u2019t make you miserable, and don\u2019t treat your parents like shit just because you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.", "YTA I used to act like this step by step for real. When I was 14. I see now what an AH I was.", "YTA and your mom is the opposite of unsupportive.", "YTA\n\nWe all have those days where we just need some compassion - but frankly your mom is right, it's not fair for you to storm around and make your parents walk on egg shells when they don't even know what is wrong or how they can help you.

You said you wanted to talk about it later and when they asked later on, you were really rude. If you hate this job so much, what are you doing about it?  Other than taking it out on your parents?", "YTA even though it probably didn\u2019t feel like it in the moment, I\u2019d seriously consider finding a different job or you\u2019ll risk becoming a permanently bitter person", "YTA to your parents. It's past time for you to go job hunting. No one should routinely cry because of their job. You are lucky to have a safety net with your parents,  who want to help. Decide what kind of support you want from them and let them know: do you just need for them to listen? Do you want help planning your job hunt? Do you want morale support and suggestions on how to deal with current job? Analyzing what makes it so sucky: kids, boss/coworkers, parents,  all of the above? Your mom is right,  they are not mind readers,  but obviously they want to sort you.\n\nOh,  an apology is warranted.

Idk if it's *your* fault either, but it sure as hell isn't theirs. \n2. You told them you didn't want to talk, wtf did you expect them to do, sit and wait silently until your royal highness was prepared to announce herself with trumpets?\n3.

You parents sound caring and loving. For what it's worth, they can make no effort with you since you are a full grown adult.   \n\n\nWe have this unhealthy idea in America that it isn't ok to live in a community with people. The world is expensive and if everyone in your house gets along and contributes to running of the household, it's fine that you're living with them. I hope you're paying rent and helping out. In Latin America, Asia and other parts of the world, this is normal and healthy and can be a win financially and emotionally.

You\u2019re 27 years old, the time for tantrums ended a long time ago. It seems like your parents are doing the best they can to help you, but this level of distress is not something they can help you with in the way you need. \n\nAdditionally, if this usually happens around your period, talk to your doctor about it.

I really urge you to talk to a professional, starting with your family doctor, about possible depression and ask if they recommend any counselling therapists. You sound fed up to the teeth and that can really mess with your head and your ability to communicate.\n\nBut don\u2019t take it out on your parents. It sounds like they\u2019re trying to support you, but they might not be the ones who can give you what you need. They\u2019re not hurting you - society\u2019s lack of care and funding in education and shitty parents not parenting their kids are hurting you. \n\nAdvice? Why not. Start with a sincere apology and tell them you\u2019re not yourself, and you are looking into taking better care of yourself. And do just that.

It's not pointless if they give you 10 minutes when you say you don't wanna talk right then but can obviously see you still stewing.\n\nPeriods suck, I agree....but I don't blame my actions on my hormones cause no matter how I feel because of them, my actions are my own. Your parents seem very supportive regardless of what tone they used when saying these things cause they're still trying to help. You do not get free reign to treat them like crap just because you can't treat the kids like crap....find something that helps you vent your emotions other than taking them out on other living beings. I've been the one getting yelled at cause there's no other place to vent....trust me, knowing it's not because of anything I said or did but rather the work situation only makes it worse.\n\nFind something that helps whether it's a cheap punching bag, furiously drawing, writing out what you're feeling in a journal, or anything else(I'm sure there's great suggestions online, I'm someone who can focus on a project to calm down so I don't have the best suggestions) and APOLOGIZE and OWN UP TO IT.

You already live at home so you don\u2019t have the standard concern most teachers have of where they\u2019d go because they need to make rent, bills, etc. you honestly have the most opportune situation to figure out how to shift careers. I would suggest leaving after this school year and taking your time to recoup.\n\nIn addition, therapy. What you\u2019ve described is not healthy. I get a one off bad month, everything is piling up, the pms\u2026 but once a month minimum? That\u2019s not it. Therapy is a wonderful thing to teach stress management, proper coping mechanisms, etc. Teaching is an incredibly stressful and exhausting job, but so are a lot of fields. Quitting teaching won\u2019t relieve all your stressors. I\u2019m worried that the problem is how you cope with stress that is making you hate your job\u2026 and if you don\u2019t figure it out, this will be you at every job field. \n\nWith all this being said, a lot of adults who move back home revert back to how they handled stress with their parents, such as yelling and saying things they can\u2019t get away with when roommates with someone. If you don\u2019t want to quit teaching, that\u2019s totally fine, but my advice then would be therapy and finding a roommate asap. You have not had the chance to fully mature as an adult living at home like this, which is why I think a lot of people are pointing out how young you sound. It\u2019s because you\u2019re able to get away with less mature behavior being with your parents, which in hindsight, might prove why you\u2019re struggling with adult level stress management/coping mechanisms.", "I\u2019m sorry, but YTA.

As a person who suffers from severe depression at times, I can recognise that you are struggling.

Wanted to go back to school. \n\nOne day I bump into my friend and he lets out that he broke up w his girlfriend. Why? \u201cAll she did was complain about her situation.
