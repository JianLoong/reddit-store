{"id": 7576, "submission_id": "10eirtv", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for telling my wife it was a mistake to stay at a baby shower?", "selftext": "So I texted my coworker (let\u2019s call him frank) and asked if we could talk so we met up during our lunch break. I apologised for everything that happened. He kept telling me it\u2019s fine and being so nice about it and that kind of made me feel worse. He said he has booked Mary a ticket back home for a week and that her sisters and friends were going to surprise her with another baby shower. I asked if he\u2019d mind my wife and I paying the expenses of the baby shower they were going to throw. He laughed and said no way but that he appreciated it. We went back and forth a bit but he eventually said he\u2019d ask his sister in law how much she spends on everything and then would let me know and we can pay half of it.\n\nI spoke to my wife when I got home from work. She apologised for ignoring me and said she doesn\u2019t know why she behaves like this. She said she is embarrassed and she can\u2019t bring herself to come to terms with how she behaved. We also spoke about the infertility thing. She said she thought her saying it out loud and discussing it with people would make it easier for her if she found out she was actually infertile because she would\u2019ve already come to terms with it. I don\u2019t get it, but hey, at least she didn\u2019t dodge accountability this time and did acknowledge that it\u2019s wrong and she needs to stop. It\u2019s slightly worrying to me how she sounds like a completely new person so often lately. Almost like there are multiple versions of her who don\u2019t know each other. \n\nI said I\u2019m glad she now realises it\u2019s wrong, and asked her to send flowers or something with an apology note to Mary\u2019s house. I also mentioned that I offered to pay for the next baby shower and she told me to insist that SHE pays it all and not half. I said I\u2019m fine with splitting it. She also said she would bake a cake and go to Mary personally to apologise. I told her Mary is leaving town for a week so that will have to wait till she gets back but she did send a lengthy text with a sincere (in my opinion) text. Mary responded saying my wife didn\u2019t need to apologise and that she understands what happened, and thanked her for attending her baby shower. Mary also apologised for leaving without saying goodbye to my wife and the rest of the guests. You see how nice Mary and Frank are? Jesus Christ.\n\nWe decided on both individual and couples therapy soon (anyone know if it\u2019s ok to do them simultaneously? She wants to but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a great idea). It was a given that we would stop trying for a baby so that\u2019s definitely on hold for now. So yeah, that\u2019s it for now I guess. I\u2019ve never been to therapy and neither has she so I\u2019m hoping this is the beginning of our relationship getting much healthier, and our individual growths as well. \n\nThank you so much to everyone who responded. My mind is brown by how many of you did. Hope you all have a great year!", "created_utc": 1673978501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eirtv/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_it_was_a_mistake/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Huh, did not expect that kind of update after the first post. I mean your wife acknowledging she is behaving badly after being so unhinged. So there might be some hope there...", "Yes, do couples and individual therapy, do them simultaneously.", "I replied to your first post. I mean... idk if this is better or worse, but she definitely needs therapy. Life is full of disappointments and bad news.  A few months of not getting pregnant is not even \"bad\", it's normal and maybe a bit disappointing, but have you seen her handle stress before?\n\nWhat if something happens to you?  Is she going to support you, or will it be self-involved histrionics?  What if you have a child, and they are sick (or all of the 10,000 other things that happen to kids)? Is she going to run your actual kids/friends/extended family away? I would personally be reflecting about how you've seen her handle other disappointments, b/c even though she is accepting accountability, she still did this?", "Oh god I've been waiting for this update!\n\nETA: Well that went just about as well as it possibly could!\n\n#[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cm7if/aita_for_telling_my_wife_it_was_a_mistake_to_stay/)", "This a great update, I think you handled things as well as you could have.  And I\u2019m glad your wife has come around and recognizes her behavior.  \n\nTherapy is an EXCELLENT idea.  Couples and individual can happen at the same time, and I think it will be really helpful.  They key is to be open and honest with the therapists.  \n\nTrying to conceive can bring up *all kinds* of issues.  Good on y\u2019all for putting those plans on hold while you sort through things.  That right there is a sign you\u2019ll be good parents one day.\n\nWishing you the best \u2764\ufe0f", "Man hormones can wreck havoc on women especially when it comes to fertility. I know I went through all kinds of hell trying to get pregnant and eventually deciding on adoption. I\u2019m proud of your wife for taking ownership of her actions and you have gone above and beyond as well. Wishing you both the best in your journey of growing your family.", "Pleasantly surprised by the outcome!!! Keep friends like Frank and Mary around, good people are hard to come by.", "When Frank\u2019s SIL responds with the amount just send a check for double the amount (the whole thing). I would\u2019ve been mortified if my wife hijacked a party like that.", "I'm not trying to slide all the way down a slippery slope here, but given that there is *some* chance, I want to add that signs of schizophrenia most often start showing up in women in the late 20s to early 30s. Therapy is a good idea regardless, but your comment about her behavior  gave me pause. Good luck to you both.", "Lol I know. I\u2019m surprised too. I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and feel somehow else. I\u2019ve researched a lot of personality disorders after some people commented it and I\u2019m honestly quite sure she has something of the sort. I\u2019m not going to bring that up to her though, hopefully the therapist can figure out what it is.", "Speaking of hormones I kind of wonder if OP's wife already is pregnant. Doesn't excuse it, but does explain the crazy emotional shift.", "the different versions of herself that don't know each other made me think of trauma induced DID\n \nAnd the struggle with conception can definitely be traumatic\n \nI too don't want to end up at the bottom of a slippery slope right out the gates\n  \nBut I definitely think mental health crisis like these are definitely things that should be kept on the table to be investigated and ruled out by mental health professionals, because the faster they are caught, the less damage they get the chance to do", "Do you know if she has been taking something to help her get pregnant, even without talking to \u00e0 doctor about it ? Some stuff sold online can really fuck you up...", "Couples therapy often happens in parallel with individual and sometimes you can sign forms for the therapist to discuss stuff (you can put whatever restrictions you want).  You may want to do this, since sometimes people aren\u2019t accurate reporters of themselves. \n\nI\u2019m glad to hear the update.  It shows promise!", "I'm surprised too. I'm glad she thinks this though, and I hope the professional help works out! \n\nHaving lived with people with untreated mental illness (including myself), I noticed that a lot of times the people who exhibit these behaviors don't realize how damaging it actually is. Glad to see this update!", "I'm glad you're both going to therapy because it's pretty obvious there's a lot for you both (but esp. your wife) to work through. Honestly, I think this was the best update that could've happened. Responsibility was taken, apologies were made and accepted, the wronged parties were very gracious and understanding, etc. I hope that things work out for you!", "I read your original post, but not the comments as I figured it would be people bombarding you insisting she has some sort of personality disorder. If this is truly a concern for you, that concern affects you - so I think it would be fine to bring it up with your own therapist. Of course, they won't try to diagnose her for you, but they may be able to offer some advice for you, however limited it may be.\n\n*\"I\u2019m not going to bring that up to her though, hopefully the therapist can figure out what it is.\"*\n\nThis is the right approach - and your therapist will likely tell you something similar.  Hoping all the best for you both.\n\nEdit: I think it would also be perfectly reasonable and important to address this in couple counseling."]}
