I apologised for everything that happened. He kept telling me it\u2019s fine and being so nice about it and that kind of made me feel worse. He said he has booked Mary a ticket back home for a week and that her sisters and friends were going to surprise her with another baby shower. I asked if he\u2019d mind my wife and I paying the expenses of the baby shower they were going to throw. He laughed and said no way but that he appreciated it. We went back and forth a bit but he eventually said he\u2019d ask his sister in law how much she spends on everything and then would let me know and we can pay half of it.\n\nI spoke to my wife when I got home from work. She apologised for ignoring me and said she doesn\u2019t know why she behaves like this. She said she is embarrassed and she can\u2019t bring herself to come to terms with how she behaved. We also spoke about the infertility thing. She said she thought her saying it out loud and discussing it with people would make it easier for her if she found out she was actually infertile because she would\u2019ve already come to terms with it. I don\u2019t get it, but hey, at least she didn\u2019t dodge accountability this time and did acknowledge that it\u2019s wrong and she needs to stop. It\u2019s slightly worrying to me how she sounds like a completely new person so often lately. Almost like there are multiple versions of her who don\u2019t know each other. \n\nI said I\u2019m glad she now realises it\u2019s wrong, and asked her to send flowers or something with an apology note to Mary\u2019s house. I also mentioned that I offered to pay for the next baby shower and she told me to insist that SHE pays it all and not half. I said I\u2019m fine with splitting it. She also said she would bake a cake and go to Mary personally to apologise. I told her Mary is leaving town for a week so that will have to wait till she gets back but she did send a lengthy text with a sincere (in my opinion) text. Mary responded saying my wife didn\u2019t need to apologise and that she understands what happened, and thanked her for attending her baby shower. Mary also apologised for leaving without saying goodbye to my wife and the rest of the guests. You see how nice Mary and Frank are? Jesus Christ.\n\nWe decided on both individual and couples therapy soon (anyone know if it\u2019s ok to do them simultaneously? She wants to but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a great idea). It was a given that we would stop trying for a baby so that\u2019s definitely on hold for now. So yeah, that\u2019s it for now I guess. I\u2019ve never been to therapy and neither has she so I\u2019m hoping this is the beginning of our relationship getting much healthier, and our individual growths as well. \n\nThank you so much to everyone who responded. My mind is brown by how many of you did.

I remember in an article about personality disorders I came across a term that describes what I\u2019m talking about.  I remembered the term as a \u201cflash of insight\u201d but when I did a little googling it didn\u2019t come up as the right term for this situation in regards to personality disorders. So I can\u2019t remember the exact term. \n\nAnyway the gist of the article was that yes they do sometimes realize what they did was wrong (especially the more intelligent ones) and apologize and can articulate why it was wrong but they lack the capacity and/or desire to change in the long term.  They\u2019ve learned that by admitting what they did they get forgiven but they don\u2019t do what normal people do which is change and try not to do it again.  It\u2019s really a manipulation tactic. \n\nAnyway I have no idea if this applies to your wife or not. I just wanted to pass along the info. A couple of times I was sucked back into my husband\u2019s family\u2019s crap because people apologized and seemed sincere and I believed them.  If your wife has a history of behaviours like this but just on a smaller scale I would be very cautious.  I\u2019ve been with my husband for 20 years and despite apologies, \u201cflashes of insight\u201d , none of the problematic people have changed \u2026 at all.  We barely talk to 3 of them.  Two of them aren\u2019t  even allowed on our property \u2026 and one of those two is my BIL and  he has been in therapy on and off for the better part of 20 years.  All he learned in therapy was how to be more manipulative.", "Trying to successfully conceive can be incredibly intimidating. I'm in that phase myself and I'm scared shitless. A lot of women see it as a very deep personal failure if they're unable to successfully carry a baby. Her behavior at the shower was concerning - does she have friends/family she gets support from? Her behavior sounds like she doesn't have a good support system in place so she acted in a way to receive support in an inappropriate time and place. \n\nYour friends are wonderful people. You could also send a large gift card to target/amazon to them instead of paying for the shower, may be easier. Or if you have access to their baby registry you can purchase a few of their big ticket items.", "Lots of therapists will see you jointly as a couple and also separately. What's said in the separate sessions remains confidential. Personally I found that helpful so you don't have to do the whole backstory with two different people, because the first couple sessions are often that. \n\nSomeone who is a good match for both of you is important. Many will offer a trial session. I've previously been advised to trial at least 3 at once but I couldn't face that emotionally. Once you choose, give someone six sessions then reassess:\n* Do you feel safe talking to them? \n* Do you trust their approach?\n* Has anything they've said so far been helpful? \n* Do they remember what you've said from session to session or do they seem primarily focused on digesting their lunch?!\n\nAs you can tell from that last one, I've experienced some crap therapists as well as amazing ones. It's important to balance trusting the process with not staying with a crap therapist. Deciding a timeline in advance helps avoid making that decision in response to a more challenging session. \n\nAlso, from my experience, better to pay more for the more qualified and experienced person. It's a money saver in the long run. Six weeks of brilliant therapy is cheaper than a year of rubbish at half the price.", "Maybe she might be bipolar?

It sounds like it might be valuable for your wife to get some medical testing. There's a lot of different mental and physical conditions that your wife could be experiencing. All you have visibility over is the behaviour that your wife exhibits, not the motivations behind it. It sounds like she has some awareness of her inappropriate behaviour which is a good sign.

I don't have the right words to describe how out of body and debilitating it is to have such out of the blue, negative emotional experiences. I was intensely aware that my emotions did not match up with the situation, and felt hijacked and out of control. But having a label gave me treatment options and words to describe my experiences to health professionals. \n\nI'm not suggesting your wife has one condition over another.

Wow, and she baked a cake, too?\u201d \n\nAn apology and quietly reimbursing the family for half (if that\u2019s what they feel comfortable with) is enough.

That\u2019s what I would caution about here. Genuine, sincere gift giving focuses on how the recipient feels, not how the giver feels. Too much can be just as offensive and unnecessary as going too far in the other direction like she did at the initial shower. \n\nI\u2019m glad she\u2019s open to talking about it and working through it, but there are definite things that need to happen before she\u2019s on her way to solid mental health, and that work can be harder than the apology and fuss she wants to make now.

I do think therapy would be best.\n\nDoing them both at the same time, as in going to one then the other right? It could be okay, but then it could also be bad in the very beginning.

So you can do them together, but make sure the appointments are a ways between so you can process everything.\n\nIf you don't your emotions and mental state wont be in a good place when you go to the next if it is a app with the couples councilor.

Try to space out the apps so you have time to process things.\n\nAnd if any one is interested in the supplement its Myo-Inositol. It comes in a pill form or a powder form. It comes alone or with a mixture of D-Chiro with it. But if you choose pill you have to take four of them a day. The powder is usually one level scoop a day. If you choose powder it needs to be mixed with something that has flavor. From what I read if it's mixed with water it can taste sweet.
