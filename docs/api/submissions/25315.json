We had our first rental place together we shared with some other friends in their 20s for about a year, and moved into our own rental when the lease was up. We lived at the next place for about a year, just her and I and everything flowed so smoothly, at which point her 13 year old sister moved in with us because their mother got into some legal issues.\n\nTheir mother has had ongoing problems with the law for quite some time, so we took my gf\u2019s younger sister in without really knowing what was going to happen. Their dad isn\u2019t in the picture either. Pretty hardcore alcoholic that I\u2019ve met a hand full of times, all while he was drunk.\n\nAfter living at that rental a few more months, we ended up leaving the rental in search of a home in another state and living in a camper for 8-9 months while we house hunted. During this time I felt like a failure not only for my girlfriend, but for her sister as well, like I have this adoptive daughter figure that I\u2019m kind of responsible for. This was an especially stressful time in my life. Living full time in a camper is much more difficult than you\u2019d imagine. \n\nWe thankfully prevailed and were able to buy a home before prices got too high for our budget. We have now lived in this house for a couple years. \n\nA little over a year ago my gf\u2019s sister got pregnant with her boyfriend at 16, and now have a healthy baby. They set up an entire bedroom as a nursery. My gf\u2019s sister, and her boyfriend share the other bedroom in my 3 bedroom house. The last room is mine and my gf\u2019s room. She uses most of the bedroom for her stuff, including her work table for her home-ran business. My areas at home include the detached single car garage and the front yard. \n\nThe sisters boyfriend just turned 18, and the sister is still 17. There is no rent charged, and I cover all the bills minus cell phone and internet. The boyfriend works at a retail store, and the sister does not work, due to taking care of a baby.\n\n\nThe second half to this is my gf has been really on me about proposing and having a baby and doing all these things in life that, growing up, I expected to do as an adult, but I also didn\u2019t expect to be living with her sister, sisters bf, and now their baby. And somehow I always feel like the bad guy. 6 years in and I haven\u2019t proposed but half of that time was an extremely strange dynamic of her sister living with us because her mom was having issues,and then having a baby, and then her bf moving in. And me not having a whole lot of say in what goes on because she\u2019s not my sister. In my opinion, I\u2019m not looking to start a family in my house while someone else is raising their family in my house. I realize both of these kids are still young, and finding a rental is getting harder by the day. Sometimes I feel like things may not change for a while, but tension is in the air.\n\n\nSo tell me your thoughts please!!!

(You're not proposing anything,. don't suggest any solution, and you're not saying no, you're just voicing the stress you feel.) \n\nYou're just sharing the feels, nothing more.

Everyone is used to you taking care of things, so that's what they'll expect you'll continue to do.\n\nYou would also not be an AH for deciding you never want to have a baby.  You may decide, by the time they move out, that parenting is a been-there-done-that thing for you.\n\nIt may be worth it for you to speak to a lawyer and have a conversation about how you can protect your investment (your house).  You're being incredibly generous to the point of financial abuse.  So, you should make sure that if your relationship ends, you at least get to maintain your investment.\n\nOnce you've spoken to a lawyer and made sure you're protected, it's time to have a conversation with the sister's boyfriend about paying rent.

Ask them to start contributing more to bills and try and save money to find a larger place where all five of you could live and still have room for you and your girlfriend to start your own family. The sister and the boyfriend are still basically kids, but they're becoming adults and it's important for them to start learning responsibility and how to finance and eventually hopefully be able to find their own place. \n\nIt's genuinely so kind of you to be willing to support them and help them through so much, but if you don't start setting boundaries on that and giving them more responsibilities, you might get stuck supporting them for far longer than is reasonable/you're willing to.

Give them an idea of a timeline and if you want you can talk to them about how they might achieve this.\n\nAnother comment suggested subtly making them feel unwelcome and I think that's a terrible idea that would set you up for more tension and frustration -- talk to them clearly about your expectations so they understand what's going on and they can plan accordingly.

If you want marriage and a baby with me, then the 3 children already living here have will need to move out and provide for themselves.

I would still try and find a way to start setting more boundaries and give them a bit more responsibility of contributing to the household in whatever ways work for everyone. I would talk to your girlfriend about what kind of compromise she would be comfortable with and gently bring up the point of \"does she really want her sister and her boyfriend and their child to be living with y'all indefinitely?\" As well as \"if you two got married and had a child of your own, where would that child live once they were old enough that they couldn't just be in a crib in your room?\" And also mention (if this is accurate) that you're willing to get married but want to wait until there's more space before having a child of your own.\n\nI slept in a bed at the foot of my parents' bed until I was like 6 because we didn't have enough rooms for me to have my own room and I know the strain that situation put on my parents and our family as a whole.

I don\u2019t know if my gf has thought far enough ahead to think \u201cwhere will the baby sleep?\u201d when old enough. The time from getting pregnant to having giving birth is unbelievably short and I never realized it until I was an adult. But that time will come fast and then what? Now we would be stressed with a full house and a toddler, gf\u2019s sister and her bf would be stressed to find a place, even more so than now. Procrastination will catch us all if we\u2019re not paying attention.", "NAH I think. But it feels like part of the issue here is that you and your gf have, for good reason, ended up doing the parents-of-teenagers part of life before you've had the chance to do all the rest. It must feel very confused. \n\nDo talk to your gf though. You don't sound like you have space, or energy, for a baby at the moment, and that will make it even harder for all of you.

You basically already have 2 kids and they won't be moving out anytime soon. It might take them another 10 years with a baby holding them back before they get any financial stability at all and that's assuming they don't keep falling pregnant over and over again. \n\nWeddings are expensive. Babies are expensive. Pregnancy and birth prevents you from working for months at a time so your income will HALF for a while on top of providing for the Brady bunch. I don't understand how your GF is so unrealistic. She can't have it all.

It's something they need to navigate, and it needs to go along with the difficult shift in their relationship from mither-daughter back to sisters. You should be able to preserve your good relationships with them, not taint what you provided this far by cutting them off. \n\nYou're not wrong, just be frank with your girlfriend and ask her outright - how did she think it would work logistically/ financially having a baby while housing another family?

If she desperately wants to get married & have a child - does that want that in a crowded house occupied by her sister, her bf & their where tour own baby wont have its own room?
