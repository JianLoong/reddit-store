We had our first rental place together we shared with some other friends in their 20s for about a year, and moved into our own rental when the lease was up. We lived at the next place for about a year, just her and I and everything flowed so smoothly, at which point her 13 year old sister moved in with us because their mother got into some legal issues.\n\nTheir mother has had ongoing problems with the law for quite some time, so we took my gf\u2019s younger sister in without really knowing what was going to happen. Their dad isn\u2019t in the picture either. Pretty hardcore alcoholic that I\u2019ve met a hand full of times, all while he was drunk.\n\nAfter living at that rental a few more months, we ended up leaving the rental in search of a home in another state and living in a camper for 8-9 months while we house hunted. During this time I felt like a failure not only for my girlfriend, but for her sister as well, like I have this adoptive daughter figure that I\u2019m kind of responsible for. This was an especially stressful time in my life. Living full time in a camper is much more difficult than you\u2019d imagine. \n\nWe thankfully prevailed and were able to buy a home before prices got too high for our budget. We have now lived in this house for a couple years. \n\nA little over a year ago my gf\u2019s sister got pregnant with her boyfriend at 16, and now have a healthy baby. They set up an entire bedroom as a nursery. My gf\u2019s sister, and her boyfriend share the other bedroom in my 3 bedroom house. The last room is mine and my gf\u2019s room. She uses most of the bedroom for her stuff, including her work table for her home-ran business. My areas at home include the detached single car garage and the front yard. \n\nThe sisters boyfriend just turned 18, and the sister is still 17. There is no rent charged, and I cover all the bills minus cell phone and internet. The boyfriend works at a retail store, and the sister does not work, due to taking care of a baby.\n\n\nThe second half to this is my gf has been really on me about proposing and having a baby and doing all these things in life that, growing up, I expected to do as an adult, but I also didn\u2019t expect to be living with her sister, sisters bf, and now their baby. And somehow I always feel like the bad guy. 6 years in and I haven\u2019t proposed but half of that time was an extremely strange dynamic of her sister living with us because her mom was having issues,and then having a baby, and then her bf moving in. And me not having a whole lot of say in what goes on because she\u2019s not my sister. In my opinion, I\u2019m not looking to start a family in my house while someone else is raising their family in my house. I realize both of these kids are still young, and finding a rental is getting harder by the day. Sometimes I feel like things may not change for a while, but tension is in the air.\n\n\nSo tell me your thoughts please!!! Am I the a**hole??", "created_utc": 1692767577, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15yu13g/aita_for_wanting_my_girlfriends_sister_to_move/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This might make me the asshole because their mother had drug issues, which led to the younger sister living with us.

You're between a rock and a hard place. \n\nI'd at least start by saying to your wife that you feel excess responsibility to support 2 families and you'd like some savings first so you're prepared to be the best parents you can be in uncertain times, in case you need (emergency ) savings, but you can't save in current situation. (You're not proposing anything,. don't suggest any solution, and you're not saying no, you're just voicing the stress you feel.) \n\nYou're just sharing the feels, nothing more. See if your wife suggests anything. \n\nAfterwards, perhaps it moves towards asking your free tenants can they contribute anything to shared bills at all,.and what their future plans are. Perhaps they can get themselves a camper. Can she work part time? They should appreciate that you're putting your plans on hold while you're supporting their family", "You've helped them as much as you can and sacrificed quite a bit. It's time they find a way to move out. Tell your GF they need to move out before your relationship can move forward.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA  \nIt's understandable that you want your gf's sister and her bf to get on their family on their feet before you start yours.", "NTA. You have been very patient and tolerant. As you said, this is tough because of the sister\u2019s young age. But it\u2019s time for her and her BF to show more independence and responsibility. I would start by making them pay a small Amy of rent )with your GF\u2019s permission of course). Then gradually increase the rent until it\u2019s high enough that they decide they\u2019d be better off moving out and getting their own place.", "NAH.  All context aside, you're never an AH for NOT having a baby - no matter the reason.  Babies are not only a massive amount of work, but a massive, lifelong commitment.  Given how everything is currently expected to be your responsibility, don't expect that will change once another baby comes.  Everyone is used to you taking care of things, so that's what they'll expect you'll continue to do.\n\nYou would also not be an AH for deciding you never want to have a baby.  You may decide, by the time they move out, that parenting is a been-there-done-that thing for you.\n\nIt may be worth it for you to speak to a lawyer and have a conversation about how you can protect your investment (your house).  You're being incredibly generous to the point of financial abuse.  So, you should make sure that if your relationship ends, you at least get to maintain your investment.\n\nOnce you've spoken to a lawyer and made sure you're protected, it's time to have a conversation with the sister's boyfriend about paying rent.  If he has a job, he can pay rent.  Start small and get him used to the idea, then work up until he's ready to get his own place.", "NTA but one of the worst things you can do is stall your life while you\u2019re waiting for someone else to get on with theirs. These are teen parents. Statistically, it\u2019s going to take them a long time to get on their feet. If you really want your gf\u2019s sister out, you should get married, have a baby and make her give up her baby\u2019s room so your baby can have their own room. You have to gradually and subtly make gf\u2019s sister feel unwelcome so she realizes that she needs to develop a game plan for her life. You should help her with that because if she doesn\u2019t have a realistic plan, she\u2019ll end up having to move back in.", "NTA\n\nBut maybe it's possible to work out a compromise? Ask them to start contributing more to bills and try and save money to find a larger place where all five of you could live and still have room for you and your girlfriend to start your own family. The sister and the boyfriend are still basically kids, but they're becoming adults and it's important for them to start learning responsibility and how to finance and eventually hopefully be able to find their own place. \n\nIt's genuinely so kind of you to be willing to support them and help them through so much, but if you don't start setting boundaries on that and giving them more responsibilities, you might get stuck supporting them for far longer than is reasonable/you're willing to. It'll only get more difficult to set these boundaries as time goes on, but if you start small and keep communicating as things develop it'll be more likely to work out better for everyone in the long run.", "Info - do you want to to get married?", "NTA. You should obviously help and support you gf\u2019s sister as much as you\u2019re able. But they need to begin chartering a course to fend for themselves - at least in terms of renting their own place and paying their own bills. You\u2019ve also set a difficult precedent here, so you and your gf need to have an honest chat about how this isn\u2019t sustainable if you and her are to get married and start a family. If you\u2019re both not on the same page then there\u2019s a different conversation to be had. \n\nSurely she doesn\u2019t think this is a permanent situation either? You really are a saint to be paying all of the bills - is that groceries etc as well??/", "NTA. But I can tell you now that they will Never move out until you throw them out. \n\nAnd your gf will never prioritize you over her sister. \n\nIt honestly seems like the lot of them see you as nothing but a cash cow.", "NTA but you need to talk to your gf.\n\nShe needs to know how you are feeling.   \n\nHow all this has impacted you.   \n\nIs she aware of any of this at all ?   \n\nYou need to have proper sit down, hopefully when you have a empty house.  \n\nYou have to ask her what is her long term plans for her sister.   \n\nIs the sister and family going to keep living with you and for how long ?  \nWhat if they end up having another child ?  \n\nAlso about the financial aspect of it all. \n\nMaybe to help yourself, you should write it all down and all the things that are concerning you and what things you need to change in order for your relationship to move forward.   \n\nRight now it seems like you are doing a lot more for everyone but your self.", "INFO: does your gf work?  If so what % does she contribute to expenses?", "First of all make sure she does not monkey with the birth control, or you will have two babies in the house.  Please contact a social working and they can help the young parents in finding a home and what public assistance is there for them.  You call it your house.  is your girlfriend on the title or just you?", "NTA but generational houses should be more of a thing -having family around isn\u2019t bad. Maybe start charging rent so you don\u2019t feel so resentful but also explain to your gf why you\u2019re not ready to propose and see what solutions she comes up with. But if you don\u2019t make it clear that you want your house to you and your gf before you move forward with life she\u2019s not gonna know", "To determine whether or not you might be the \"asshole\" in this situation, it's essential to consider the context and details surrounding the scenario.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Make clear to your GF that you don't feel comfortable starting a family in this situation and that you guys need to figure out a plan to transition her sister out or for them to contribute if you're ok with that.\n\nI'd suggest starting by charging them a nominal rent (which, if you want, you can save part of it for them to use as a security deposit for when they find their own place) -- but they also need to understand that they need to be working on figuring out how to fully support themselves. Give them an idea of a timeline and if you want you can talk to them about how they might achieve this.\n\nAnother comment suggested subtly making them feel unwelcome and I think that's a terrible idea that would set you up for more tension and frustration -- talk to them clearly about your expectations so they understand what's going on and they can plan accordingly. All of this is easier said than done, so good luck.", "NTA they\u2019re old enough now that they should be working towards getting their own place.", "Definitely NTA. In fact, seems like you are the only one with your head screwed on straight! You\u2019re carrying the load for everyone and not getting much appreciation. This is definitely not a good time to complicate things with another heavy, lifetime responsibility. Lil sis, baby and bf need a home of their own asap, even if a studio apartment. They need an exit plan. Lil sis needs a job and to start looking into daycare. Maybe big sis can help sometimes and their family can come for Sunday dinner or Friday pizza. You need your home and some relief long before you add a baby and all that that entails.", "NTA but I can foresee the sister and bf moving out, gf rushing to get married and sis, bub, maybe the bf and probably another baby on the way wanting to move back in when the adult world is hard, they break up or he loses a job.\n\nYou've been more than generous and deserve a quiet, stable life on your own terms and a family when you're ready.", "I think you should talk to your partner and tell them how you feel its the only way forward please update soon and good luck", "I believe that if they want to be adults and have a child, then the smart move would be to be an adult and find a place to live. That probably sounds harsh but I have a life to live as well. It\u2019s really unfortunate that their parents couldn\u2019t help her more. My gf helps them more than anyone.", "Thank you, sometimes I feel like I need to hear I\u2019m not the AH for NOT having a baby. Apart from raising a teenager the last few years, I also had a younger brother who was born when I was 12, so helped raise a baby at that time in my life. Sometimes I do feel like that raising a child thing has just come and gone. Hard to really say!", "We\u2019ve talked about it, but I bought into the market at a low time with a good interest rate. It wouldn\u2019t make financial sense for me to get another home loan now thats 6-7% interest at least, and price gouged, although a man could dream I suppose. I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice that for anyone but my own kids. Just a tough situation all around because I feel almost like her sister is like a step daughter to me now.", "I do, and I did. I can tell having her sister here really changed things. I feel like the gf I had that wasn\u2019t raising her sister, was different than gf one that is raising her sister, metaphorically. She really kinda became a mother without me becoming a father. She\u2019s just different now than she was when she didn\u2019t have to worry about someone else under her wing. But I don\u2019t have that bond to her sister like she does so it\u2019s just a really different and strange feeling that is hard to explain. All in all, I do still want to marry her.", "Exactly it\u2019s an unfortunate situation but you need the two rooms their using for you and your girlfriend\u2019s future kids", "doesn\u2019t sound harsh to me if you work with them to make it happen? I.e. help them find an affordable place, let them know you\u2019re not rushing them out but they should start the process or something.", "If they are old enough to have unprotected sex and start a family, they get to behave as adult until the end", ">The second half to this is my gf has been really on me about proposing and having a baby and doing all these things\n\nI think you need to be straight with your girlfriend and say \"I'm sorry, but I'm already providing all the expenses and housing for 3 children I never agreed to adopt, and I'm barely keeping my head above water financially. If you want marriage and a baby with me, then the 3 children already living here have will need to move out and provide for themselves. So you choose: either you get your sister and her family to launch out into living in their own home and paying their own expenses, or accept that there is not going to be enough money or room for marriage and any more children for us as long as they're here.\"\n\nIt's going to be a hard reality for her to hear -- but she *definitely* needs to hear it.", "I'll admit I fully forgot the part about you owning (or being in the process of paying off a mortgage for) the home. That's absolutely fair to not want to buy another house or give up your progress on owning your own home for the sake of having more room. I would still try and find a way to start setting more boundaries and give them a bit more responsibility of contributing to the household in whatever ways work for everyone. I would talk to your girlfriend about what kind of compromise she would be comfortable with and gently bring up the point of \"does she really want her sister and her boyfriend and their child to be living with y'all indefinitely?\" As well as \"if you two got married and had a child of your own, where would that child live once they were old enough that they couldn't just be in a crib in your room?\" And also mention (if this is accurate) that you're willing to get married but want to wait until there's more space before having a child of your own.\n\nI slept in a bed at the foot of my parents' bed until I was like 6 because we didn't have enough rooms for me to have my own room and I know the strain that situation put on my parents and our family as a whole. It's one thing for an infant or toddler but at a certain point there needs to be room for the kid to not be sleeping in their parents' room.", "No worries. Sorry for my short winded response, without addressing the latter half of your response lol. I think another person suggested charging a small affordable amount of rent to build up a feeling of independence. I don\u2019t wanna send them off into the world unprepared, but I don\u2019t wanna hold up other plans for my life either. I don\u2019t know if my gf has thought far enough ahead to think \u201cwhere will the baby sleep?\u201d when old enough. The time from getting pregnant to having giving birth is unbelievably short and I never realized it until I was an adult. But that time will come fast and then what? Now we would be stressed with a full house and a toddler, gf\u2019s sister and her bf would be stressed to find a place, even more so than now. Procrastination will catch us all if we\u2019re not paying attention."]}
