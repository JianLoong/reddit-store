We\u2019ve moved twice in the last two years and have had issues with mail security, so my mom offered to let me use her address to send packages to, even though I\u2019ve moved out. \n\nEvery time I order a package to her house, she opens it. Every. Time. I\u2019ve asked her nicely in the past to please stop opening my packages, but she uses the excuse that she doesn\u2019t even look at the shipping label, and assumes every package delivered to the house is for her. She apparently opens all of my dad\u2019s packages too, and while he doesn\u2019t like it, he\u2019s decided to live with it. \n\nI\u2019m not really okay with this. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m ordering anything weird, usually clothes or things from Amazon, but I feel like it\u2019s an invasion of my privacy to always open my packages. We had a more heated exchange recently where I asked her more firmly to check the labels first and stop opening my packages, and her response was to tell me flat out no, and to either deal with it or stop having things delivered there.\n\nI know she\u2019s already doing me a favor to allow me to use her address for packages, but I feel like asking her to check the shipping label is not a big ask. I also think that it\u2019s something she should be doing anyways, in case she gets a neighbor\u2019s package by mistake.\n\nSome other important info:\n- I order things maybe once a month at the most and don\u2019t ever order large items. The biggest thing I\u2019ve ordered was 3 sweaters.\n- She doesn\u2019t have a problem with mail and always checks the recipient on letters, its only packages that she opens. \n- She has a history of struggling to respect my privacy, even going so far as to look through my purse when I lived with her.\n- She offered to let me keep the house as my permanent address for important mail ans packages.

It's deliberate snooping. Nobody can \"accidentally\" fail to read a shipping label despite repeatedly being asked to.\n\nThat said, you may want to consider getting a PO Box.", "NTA, but she has told you she is not going to change. You need to pick another address to have your boxes shipped to(maybe bf parents) or a trusted friend or relative. If you mostly buy from Amazon, you can have delivery sent to Amazon pickup locations near your home or work, then she never gets to see it.  Sorry your mom's such a snoop!", "NTA,  but get a PO box", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is nosy. She's also using her 'largesse' to bully you into getting her way. And as your mom has clearly stated she doesn't intend to stop snooping, which is what she's doing because there's no reason she should feel entitled to know what's in your packages, you now have all the info you need to make a decision. \n\n1.) Let her keep snooping and live with it. This isn't what I would choose, as I don't much like being a door mat for assholes, but if you want to keep the peace (your mother's peace, not yours,  your opinion doesn't matter here) then, hey. It's certainly a choice.\n\n2.) Get deliveries elsewhere. As having them go to your mom's hasn't actually solved your security issue, look into a truly neutral third party. The post office, those amazon lockers (someone help me here with these and what they're called) or I think you could call FedEx/UPS and see what options they have available. Might cost a bit,  but it's a way of removing your mom and her entitlement from the equation. Plus, it does actually address those security concerns. \n\n3.) Give your mother exactly what she wants. Glitter bombs come to mind. Or sex stuff. Order the biggest, most obnoxious, logically indecipherable sex toy your budget will allow. Think outside your species, defined gender roles, religious intangibility. Whatever she might think is a little creepy and that your budget allows (you might just want to do one or two things while you swap to a secured box) run with it.\n\n\"Alien-nun multi-ended horse cock strap on with real thrusting action.\" \n\nOr \"Jesus face flashlight.\" \n\nMaybe some books. \"Talk Furry to Me: erotica from the kennels of the Westminster dog show.\"\n\nIf you're feeling real shitty, address them to your dad.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but she won\u2019t stop.

It sounds like she wants to be in everyone's business and she is opening the packages on purpose to know what people are buying.  It sounds like she doesn't care at all that anyone is upset by this, and it sounds like she will never stop regardless of what you say or how many times you say it.
