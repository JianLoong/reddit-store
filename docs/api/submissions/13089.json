I don't use Facebook much, but all my extended family, friends from high school and college, etc use it. There's been a lot going on with my health and everyone's been hounding me for updates. I found the easiest way to update people, and since my profile is private, is to just post there as I go through the transplant journey. After my latest appointment with the transplant team, it was a lot of information, so I made a fairly long post about it. \n\nMy husband (34m) has 3 younger half siblings from his mom's second marriage. The oldest, Jane (20f) is autistic, but is pretty mature for her age, studying to become a doctor in a good university, and although we aren't super close, we've known eachother for 15 years and I even used to babysit her and her younger two siblings. We've never had an actual fight in all these years, but as hard as I've tried to have a relationship with her and the others, they have always made it very difficult to connect. Maybe that has to do with my husband being the black sheep of the family and they see me as an extension of him. I've tried very hard to reach out to them and spend time with them at family gatherings, just to be treated like I'm not really welcome in the family. His parents (mom and stepdad) on the other hand are generally very supportive and loving. I still continue to send birthday cards and text them to see how they're doing and 90% of the time get no response. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't hurt a little that they ice me out so much, but I know you can't force people to have a relationship with you.\n\nSo, last night, after my long update about my upcoming surgeries, Jane commented on my post. It's very unusual for her to use Facebook, so I was eager to see it. When I saw her comment, it said \"yea, not going to read that all, happy for you, or sorry that happened, I don't really care.\" I was very hurt and thought that was a really nasty thing to say to someone sharing something so important and sensitive. I told my husband and he admitted he told her via text that it was fine to post. When I was hurt by it, he called me a snowflake and told me she's autistic so she doesn't get social norms and why that was rude. I told him being neurodivergent doesn't give her license to be mean. We got in a huge fight and he went to bed early. \n\nSo AITA? I didn't even say anything to her, just quietly removed her from my friend list as she's obviously not going to want to see my future updates.\n\nEdit: My husband came home from work with flowers and apologies. He said he thought all day about how it had hurt my feelings, and that wasn't his intention. Apparently, he was sent an image of the meme from her when he okayed it, thinking that since I have a twisted sense of humor usually, that I might get a chuckle and move on. He said he saw it as a nice thing that she was reaching out to me at all and took it as her trying to lighten the mood and make me laugh. She did not send me the meme, but rather typed out the words, so I had no reference of it being a meme, which would've taken some of the sting out. I would have thought it was just a joke in poor taste, but not a personal insult. Once he saw the comment written out that way, he understood my perspective and realized he messed up. He asked me to please still consider she didn't mean it that way and not blame her as he was the one that told her it wouldn't hurt me. \n\nSome of you asked if he usually puts me down or treats me poorly, and the answer is a resounding no. We are not headed for divorce, and he does have real remorse. He's been my rock and my advocate with my health for a very long time, and we make a good team. This was very uncharacteristic of him, which is why I wanted others' opinions. When my health suffers, I can be overly sensitive, and as a neurotypical person, I didn't know if maybe I was really being too hard on her. It seems it was poor judgment on his part and maybe some miscommunication on hers for the way she presented it. \n\nOthers asked what her mom, my MIL thought and I don't know, as I didn't go to her about it and she's not very active on Facebook so I doubt she saw the comment before I deleted it.\n\nThe consensus is clear that I'm not alone in thinking she needs to learn some better people skills/compassion/bedside manner if she becomes a doctor. I think the best thing is for me to just reach out to her and explain why it came across as unkind and not let people continue to make the excuse about her autism. That's not doing her any favors, and she's bright with a lot of potential. I am always proud of her accomplishments and want to see her follow her dream and become a great doctor one day. \n\nThanks, everyone, for your perspectives.", "created_utc": 1679670606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120n7eb/aita_for_deleting_my_sil_from_facebook_after_she/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to have more compassion as a doctor towards other people so people should be calling her on it", "Autism isnt a get out of jail free card, he had the opportunity to tell her that what she said was going to be hurtful and she would have known for the future, OP you are NTA, however i will add the your hurt should be directed at your ah husband for being ignorant and disrespectful towards you, if you get the chance maybe talk to SIL and explain why it was hurtful, and if in future she doesnt want to read a long post and/or doesnt care about it then maybe just dont comment at all", "Jane is going to make a terrible doctor", "She has a husband problem, not an SIL problem.", "Gunna flat out say it I can be petty as hell, and if you put that on my page I would respond, \" dang sister if this is how you treat family going through a health issue I hope they never let you work on living humans.\" But that is because quite frankly, we already have too many bad doctors who don't listen to their patients and have no patience for patients. (Ugh, English sucks I hope I spelled all those right.) Could you imagine if you had a list of ailments and in the middle of telling her what they are she says, \"That is too much to take in I'm just going to say you have 6 months to live, and leave it at that.\" Ugh, she may very well make a very great researcher, but if she hasn't been taught better than this by now, she will have zero bedside manner. If she lives in the US, we need fewer doctors like her and more who actually understand and use empathy. I'm not saying her disability is the issue, rather people not teaching her that what she says and does have an impact on others is. I'll be the first to honestly leave the best surgeon for the job if they make me uncomfortable or angry by not listening or having a lack of any human decency. I need to be comfortable and happy with my heart and head in a good place before being knocked out and cut open.", "100%!!!", "....what *kind* of socialist? a National Socialist?", "I don't think that's how leftists operate usually", "NTA\n\nLooks like she had the decency to think, \"Maybe this is rude? I better check. \" Your husband is the one being an asshole.", "NTA  \nYou are right, SIL being autistic does not give her a licence to be mean.

I hope you can have a discussion about it - if he KNEW it would hurt you, why he laughed and told her to comment that...", "for fucks sake...you are saying your husband okayed that specific message?\n\nSorry for what you are going thru and how you are being treated.  Honestly time to give up on them, you have enough on your plate without these people.\n\nAll the best and of course NTA.", "NTA, being autistic is no excuse for being a crap person, your husband sucks for ignoring you, it seems that it is his custom to put you down like that", "> When I was hurt by it, he called me a snowflake\n\nWhat a worthless bum.

He, the person who was supposed to \"get the social cues\" said it was fine. The sister is TA bc being on the spectrum is not an excuse to be rude, I'm also on the spectrum and sometimes I do say the wrong thing but it's on me to listen when people say they were bothered or offended and apologize.

I think SIL will be fine as a doctor, she\u2019s aware that she doesn\u2019t understand social norms and interactions so she asks for help to navigate through them. She sent a meme to hubby for appropriateness to hubby, he said okay to the meme, SIL typed out the words instead of posting the meme, and hubby was unaware of that detail.
