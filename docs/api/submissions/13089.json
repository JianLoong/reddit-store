I don't use Facebook much, but all my extended family, friends from high school and college, etc use it. There's been a lot going on with my health and everyone's been hounding me for updates. I found the easiest way to update people, and since my profile is private, is to just post there as I go through the transplant journey. After my latest appointment with the transplant team, it was a lot of information, so I made a fairly long post about it. \n\nMy husband (34m) has 3 younger half siblings from his mom's second marriage. The oldest, Jane (20f) is autistic, but is pretty mature for her age, studying to become a doctor in a good university, and although we aren't super close, we've known eachother for 15 years and I even used to babysit her and her younger two siblings. We've never had an actual fight in all these years, but as hard as I've tried to have a relationship with her and the others, they have always made it very difficult to connect. Maybe that has to do with my husband being the black sheep of the family and they see me as an extension of him. I've tried very hard to reach out to them and spend time with them at family gatherings, just to be treated like I'm not really welcome in the family. His parents (mom and stepdad) on the other hand are generally very supportive and loving. I still continue to send birthday cards and text them to see how they're doing and 90% of the time get no response. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't hurt a little that they ice me out so much, but I know you can't force people to have a relationship with you.\n\nSo, last night, after my long update about my upcoming surgeries, Jane commented on my post. It's very unusual for her to use Facebook, so I was eager to see it. When I saw her comment, it said \"yea, not going to read that all, happy for you, or sorry that happened, I don't really care.\" I was very hurt and thought that was a really nasty thing to say to someone sharing something so important and sensitive. I told my husband and he admitted he told her via text that it was fine to post. When I was hurt by it, he called me a snowflake and told me she's autistic so she doesn't get social norms and why that was rude. I told him being neurodivergent doesn't give her license to be mean. We got in a huge fight and he went to bed early. \n\nSo AITA? I didn't even say anything to her, just quietly removed her from my friend list as she's obviously not going to want to see my future updates.", "created_utc": 1679670606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120n7eb/aita_for_deleting_my_sil_from_facebook_after_she/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s not a black sheep he\u2019s a an awful person. Why are you with him?", "NTA. She was definitely the asshole. It costs nothing for her to not say anything hurtful. She went out of her way to wrote that, and even reached out to her her brother if it is okay. To me, it indicates that she recognises it might be rude.\n\nI'm sorry that your husband was callous about it. You are not a snowflake. Your feelings are valid. He too is an asshole.", "NTA, it sounds she knew what she was saying, and that your spouse ok'ed it and is belittling you as well is crazy. I would have deleted her comment and blocked her zero Fs given.", "Never TA for spring-cleaning the list of people in your life.", "You are never the asshole for removing someone who is being toxic.", "NTA. If your extended family weren't such jerks to you and your husband, deleting her permanently might have be an overreaction. But even then, she said herself that she doesn't really care, so....", "NTA, it is very hurtful for her to say that she doesn't care about you and your health. As they say, it's better to say nothing at all than to say something hurtful. I feel for you,  you have a right to post whatever you'd like about your health. By deleting her, you're doing self-care.

You're going through some incredibly intense and scary stuff right now, you absolutely do not need anyone making things difficult for you.", "NTA. It was a rude and dismissive comment when you're discussing major medical issues.\n\nYour husband is the king of the AHs here though. His excuse is that his neurodivergent sister doesn't understand that being rude is rude...but what's his excuse? He could so easily have told her that this is not the place for that (and even why).\n\nYou've cut one person off, but apparently you're still dealing with a massively unsupportive and cruel husband. I'm sorry.", "NTA - The AH here isn't your SIL necessarily, but your husband. What she said was at best dismissive, at worst cruel but apparently she checked with him, thinking that maybe it wasn't appropriate (and to be fair, maybe she just doesn't want anything to do with you for whatever reason but she still doesn't need to make that your problem. She'd probably be better off just not following you, maybe your husband could have siggested that instead, idk?) And he green-lit it! Then tried to just excuse it with her lack of awareness for social norms.. dude... she was on the fence if it might be innapropriate and you totally just missed an opportunity to stick up for and protect YOU, OR be helpful to her! Then doubled down and mocked you to your face. Hugely cruel! You're definitely not wrong to be hurt but your SIL isn't your only or biggest problem\n\nEDIT#1 - I used \"cruel\" several times but cruelty only scratches the surface of your husband's behavior... disgusting... abhorrent... repugnant... add and substitute liberally and then some\n\nEDIT #2 I never put NTA originally, in it wasn't clear how I felt..  yeeesh...", "Yeah that was not autism speaking she was just being an ass. I\u2019m an autistic adult and sometimes I can be a little too much but I am never inherently rude like that and I don\u2019t get a free pass bc I\u2019m on the spectrum.", "NTA. His family hasn't been supportive of you anyway, and regardless of her autism, her comments shows the truth, that she really doesn't care. I'm so sorry, it would be crass of anybody to say that to you, especially family.", "NTA.  But your boyfriend is enabling her.  When people on the spectrum make social faux pas, the family should explain to them what was wrong with what they said.  (And also that they do not have to say everything that comes to their head)\n\n She had the insight to ask her brother for pre-approval, and he set you both up.  I would let her know that you were offended and hurt and why (the why is the important part).  \"That was a very cruel comment to make. Do you really not care about me at all, or did you mean something else. Because if you dont care about me at all, we should'nt be following each other on social media. Then, depending on her answer, block her or maybe offer to be a sounding board in the future since  her brother sucks at it. \n\nBut if she comes back funky, just remove her and the rest of his family.  Though honestly, I would let the boyfriend go too.  I can't imagine one of my kids running that by me (yes, they are on the spectrum) and me not having a sit down about how NT people would interpret that comment.  I have had many conversations with mine about what NT people \"hear\" when NDs talk.", "NTA. But your husband most definitely is. He has no excuse what so ever for condoning that post, or calling you a snowflake for being upset about it.", "NTA. Your husband and his sister most definitely are.", "NTA, I block people for things they did years ago and remembered again that that made them an a**", "NTA but this is a husband not a sister in law problem. Not ok.", "NTA. She needs a new attitude if she wants to be a Dr. Being autistic isn't a license to be a rude AH.", "NTA. Being autistic means you can\u2019t always read social situations, but that was certainly not the time or place for a meme format. Shitty your husband went behind your back and said it was okay, I hope your transplant goes well!", "Autistic or not, homegirl is studying to be a doctor which is a people-facing job for the most part. It would benefit her to at least attempt to LEARN the social norms and what is acceptable and not acceptable so she can set herself up for success. As it stands, she and your husband are using her disability to excuse her weaponized incompetence - she clearly knew what she was typing was inappropriate if she sent it to your husband. Worse, he approved it and didn\u2019t defend you or think about your feelings. And then they used autism as an excuse to \u201cnot know what\u2019s acceptable\u201d when they both clearly knew what would happen from posting a comment like that.

She was probably trying to be funny and your husband either knew the meme and thoughts it'd be funny too, or was presented with the comment as \"it's a joke and she'll totally laugh\". \n\nAll that being said, there's a time and place for jokes and memes and this clearly was not the place for it. Even if she missed that because she's autistic, your husband should have caught that and told her no.\n\nI don't think she was trying to be malicious but in the end she was very rude. You're NTA and your hurt feelings are valid.\n\nThis is the meme I'm thinking of btw.

I apologize whenever it's expressed to me that I said something inappropriate.

Your husband is AH, too.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! First of all I hope you'll be okay <3 what she wrote is a meme which gets used a lot on twitter and instagram in 'social media fights'. It's rude and so is your husband to approve this.", "NAH She clearly doesn't care, and his family has consistently made you feel as if you were not part of the family. This was rude and hurtful and showed blantent disrespect. Removing her from your friends list and yourself from further conflict via FB was definitely the right move.\n\n Your husband is definitely an AH for telling her it was perfectly fine and not supporting you. He claimed that she didn't know better, which shows that he knew it was wrong, but let it happen anyway. \n\nYou did not insult her or retaliate but rather simply removed someone who was never accepting of you.", "That\u2019s a meme quote/comment. \n\nNAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wanna let you know if you don't already, the specific words she used (\"not gonna read all that, sorry it happened/happy for you\") are a meme these days, she wasn't the one who came up with them. Maybe she thought it was funny. But they were still inappropriate words to say to you about something so personal and sensitive. That's the kind of thing you copy/paste to a man ranting in your DMs about how all women are evil when you reject him on Instagram. Not something you say to a family member sharing their medical journey. She might have looked to her brother for confirmation you would find it funny. \n\nI think his approval of her insensitivity, and subsequent dismissal of your feelings are a bigger problem than an autistic person using an insensitive meme.", "It's fb.

It\u2019s OP\u2019s husband that\u2019s the asshole.  If the sister is genuinely autistic and genuinely doesn\u2019t understand social situations well, then of course she\u2019s going to unintentionally say hurtful things.  In order to avoid this, she reached out to OP\u2019s husband to externally validate that her planned comment was funny and wouldn\u2019t be interpreted as hurtful, an analysis that she is incapable of doing.  And he wrongfully told her it was fine.  Sister did nothing wrong, but husband did.", "NTA. If she can understand the meaning behind a meme she was fully aware of her action when she posted that comment. Also, is your husband usually this much of an asshole?", "Yes, she texted him verbatim what she wanted to comment, and he laughed and told her to post whatever she wanted. Then he pulled the \"she doesn't understand why you'd be hurt and she should get a pass because she's autistic\" card.", "When I say black sheep, it's more about his differing political views from the family, the fact that his mom raised him alone as a teenage mother, he's always been treated very differently than her golden children from her new family, etc. He was always the scapegoat of the family, and he's just recently started having a better relationship with them. His parents have always been good to me, so it's not the whole family that's toxic. I'm very close with his mom in particular. \n\nI'm with him because, typically, he's very kind to me, has been an excellent partner for 15 years, is supportive in all my needs, and is even the one giving me his kidney for the transplant. This situation is very unlike him. I know he's protective of his little sister in particular because of her struggles with bullying and such through her teen years, but I never thought he'd actually encourage her to be cruel to me. That honestly hurts more than her comment.", "But HE would have and told her to post anyway.", "Oh dear fudge...... I think you might be focusing on the wrong problem with the wrong person", "Hi, I'm on the autism spectrum, that's not acceptable. She should know that, or she should be going into something else, because if that's what she says to someone in her family, she's never going to make it as a medical professional. Your husband doesn't have that excuse, and still said it was ok, so he's just a dick.", "She already knew it was wrong because she asked if it was ok beforehand.", "I know you are sick but leave this person. They are vile.", "I call bullshit. If she's smart enough to be a doctor she's smart enough to learn social norms.", "My spectrum filled family calls bullshit on the autism pass. \n\nNTA, that was incredibly rude for her to post and for your husband to support. Kicking her off FB was appropriate.", "So she took the time to text him about it but not the time to skim the Facebook post??", "His snowflake comment tells me all i need to know abt his political views", "This is the point, OP!! She knew it was a rude thing to say, or at least questionable, so she asked permission. That made it his job as someone who wants to protect her (and should want to protect you, too) to advise her against posting it and saying your update was on a serious health matter and not the place for her to be flippant. I think quietly removing her from your FB was the right choice but I\u2019d also have a serious conversation with your husband. You mentioned he\u2019s sensitive about his sister and worried because she\u2019s been bullied before etc but encouraging her to be rude like this isn\u2019t going to endear her to people. He should care about helping turn his sister into a bully and he should care about his wife feeling hurt, especially when you\u2019re going through such a difficult time and she\u2019s basically mocking you for that.", "yup.  you nailed it.", "It's funny because you'd think that he (by using that dumb term) leans conservative. But in actuality, he is more of a socialist while his family are all Trump supporters.", "Actions say differently. I don't know why you're upset at her, he is the problem with that post.\nYou and SIL aren't close so deleting her will probably be fine. She was being honest, as hard as that was for you, he was being cruel."]}
