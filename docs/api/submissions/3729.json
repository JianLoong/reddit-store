We both have children from previous relationships. I have a 14 yo daughter and he has a 5 yo son, Luke. Luke\u2019s mom is Mikes ex wife, Ashley. Mike has had some issues with never telling Ashley no about taking Luke on nights we aren\u2019t supposed to have him. He\u2019s cancelled dates with me and family trips etc because Ashley asks him out of the blue to take Luke with some frequency. He used to be much worse about it but he\u2019s gotten better and has only been asked as a last resort. \n\nWell this past Friday, sure enough Ashley calls us asking us to babysit because she has concert tickets for Saturday night. Mike had to work so he wasn\u2019t able to and then it turned to me. I had already made plans that evening to have a mom daughter date with my daughter. I had reserved us mani-pedis and a nice dinner. These mom daughter dates are important to my daughter and I since she is going through the mess that is puberty. I told Ashley \u201cI had other plans\u201d. I figured she\u2019s got enough family, friends, and money (she alone makes the same amount Mike and I make, not counting the child support he pays) to figure something out on her own. I was wrong. \n\nSaturday came and she was in a tizzy, blowing up Mike and my phone begging us to take Luke that night. I stood firm and told her \u201cno\u201d and that my time with my daughter was more important to me than her going to some concert. I silenced my phone and took my daughter on our date. We had a wonderful time and had an amazing dinner. We come home to find Mike royally angry with me. Ashley, her friends, and her family had spent all evening calling him, yelling at him telling him how unreasonable and how much of a b!tch I was for not watching Luke and that I\u2019m obviously going to be a bad stepmom since I didn\u2019t care to watch him. Then the custody threats started, how they\u2019ll take away Mikes weekends with Luke, etc. And he wasn\u2019t able to reach me since I had silenced my phone. \n\nIt\u2019s calmed down a little since then but now Ashley is demanding I refund her the $300 she spent on her ticket since she couldn\u2019t go since I refused to watch Luke that night. Mike and I have been saving up money bit by bit to take my daughter and Luke on a trip next year. Mike is just telling me to give her money from it and avoid the fight, but I don\u2019t want to. If we give in to these demands, she\u2019s just going to continue these behaviors and using us.

Mike needs to understand it\u2019s not fair to you or him to drop everything because Ashley doesn\u2019t schedule things when Luke is scheduled with you guys.

I\u2019m glad you are treating your daughter with the attention and time she deserves.", "Your in a no win situation.  The hole situation is f'ed up.

If you have any self-esteem at all you should realize your SO doesn't have a bit of respect for you. He is focused on making his ex happy and is trying to use you in that all important endeavor. You, your family trip, your daughter's needs - none of it matters to him as much as his ex's happiness does. There is nothing remotely reasonable about either his or his ex's behavior. How can you not see that? If you wish to spend the rest of your life in service of his need to please his ex, then hang in there, but don't complain about choosing to do so.

His child *IS NOT* your responsibility in any way, shape, or form! Period!  \n\nIf he is going to be*\"royally angry*\" with anyone at all, then it should be his *baby mama and her family*! He should also be*\"royally angry*\" with himself, as well, for constantly rolling over and acquiescing to her every effin whim! You do not factor in to this equation at all, OP, and you were absolutely correct in removing yourself from it! As I said, it may also be best that you remove yourself from the entire relationship.

If there is, and she's continually violating said order, then baby daddy needs to take her back to court and go after her for full custody and child support.

Or better, she should have skipped the damn concert and actually spent time with her own kid! Kinda like how*you* do with *your daughter*!\n\nEdited to add:\n\nIs she high, demanding you reimburse her $309 for a concert ticket that she bought on a night she was supposed to have her own f**king kid!???? The absolute audacity! She should be the one afraid of losing custody! She's the one who keeps pawning him off when it's her time to have him!
