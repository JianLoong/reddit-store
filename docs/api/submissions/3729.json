We both have children from previous relationships. I have a 14 yo daughter and he has a 5 yo son, Luke. Luke\u2019s mom is Mikes ex wife, Ashley. Mike has had some issues with never telling Ashley no about taking Luke on nights we aren\u2019t supposed to have him. He\u2019s cancelled dates with me and family trips etc because Ashley asks him out of the blue to take Luke with some frequency. He used to be much worse about it but he\u2019s gotten better and has only been asked as a last resort. \n\nWell this past Friday, sure enough Ashley calls us asking us to babysit because she has concert tickets for Saturday night. Mike had to work so he wasn\u2019t able to and then it turned to me. I had already made plans that evening to have a mom daughter date with my daughter. I had reserved us mani-pedis and a nice dinner. These mom daughter dates are important to my daughter and I since she is going through the mess that is puberty. I told Ashley \u201cI had other plans\u201d. I figured she\u2019s got enough family, friends, and money (she alone makes the same amount Mike and I make, not counting the child support he pays) to figure something out on her own. I was wrong. \n\nSaturday came and she was in a tizzy, blowing up Mike and my phone begging us to take Luke that night. I stood firm and told her \u201cno\u201d and that my time with my daughter was more important to me than her going to some concert. I silenced my phone and took my daughter on our date. We had a wonderful time and had an amazing dinner. We come home to find Mike royally angry with me. Ashley, her friends, and her family had spent all evening calling him, yelling at him telling him how unreasonable and how much of a b!tch I was for not watching Luke and that I\u2019m obviously going to be a bad stepmom since I didn\u2019t care to watch him. Then the custody threats started, how they\u2019ll take away Mikes weekends with Luke, etc. And he wasn\u2019t able to reach me since I had silenced my phone. \n\nIt\u2019s calmed down a little since then but now Ashley is demanding I refund her the $300 she spent on her ticket since she couldn\u2019t go since I refused to watch Luke that night. Mike and I have been saving up money bit by bit to take my daughter and Luke on a trip next year. Mike is just telling me to give her money from it and avoid the fight, but I don\u2019t want to. If we give in to these demands, she\u2019s just going to continue these behaviors and using us.
