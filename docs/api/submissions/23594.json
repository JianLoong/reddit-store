I\u2019ll try to resume the facts.\n\n2009: I, Bella (23F at the time), got married to Fred (27M att).  \n2010: My mother Lisa (50F att) got divorced from my dad.  \n2012: Fred asked for the divorce with our daughter being only 3 months old.\n\nIt was a difficult time, and I went to my mother for help. It was broken inside and thank god I had a support network to help me. My mother, however, was very distant and decided to move to another town some months after my divorce.\n\nLife was already hard enough when I received the shocking news: Lisa (53F att) was dating my ex-husband, and father of my daughter, Fred (31M att). I was so hurt that I almost klm. The whole family was shocked, and everybody stopped talking with Lisa. It was a crazy time for me. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTime has passed, I got married again, I had another daughter, my life went fine, but I can\u2019t lie that I was different, I don\u2019t trust anybody anymore, I am always waiting for the worst, I still needs sleeping pills.\n\n2021: I am happily married with 2 daughters, a nice family, living my life when I was informed that Fred (39M att), who was the worst father ever, I think he saw my daughter 3 times since the divorce, had died. I was indifferent to that, and my daughter felt the same way because they didn\u2019t have a relationship at all.\n\nWell, the whole process with inheritance and everything was a mess because Lisa was making things difficult like trying to hide some of the things he had to not share with my daughter, his only daughter. After a lot of work, everything was settled, but I know that she said to people that I took advantage of the fact of some of her things being in his name to take a part of it.\n\n2023: My young sister Gabi (31F) started talking about how much Lisa changed since Fred died, that she was regretting her choices and that she wanted a chance of making things right.

I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with Lisa and if she\u2019s feeling bed, fine, that\u2019s on her, I don\u2019t need to forgive her and to build a new relationship with her.\n\nLast weekend Gabi told me that she wants to invite Lisa to my nephew birthday party, and I said that it\u2019s fine, but I am not going or sending my daughters or mostly, my husband since she tends to go after then. Gabi is annoyed at me and keeps trying to convince me that I should give a new chance to Lisa.\n\nOn the other side Gabi is insisting a lot and some people thinks that I am being cruel because I have my family, my life is fine, and Lisa is lonely now that Fred died. I don\u2019t care, she can be lonely as she wants. Am I the asshole here? Am I being evil?  \n\n\ntl;dr: my mother Lisa (63F) had a more than 3 years affair with my husband before he divorced me and went to live with her. Now, after more than 10 years, he's dead and she wants me to forgive her. My sister and other family members are insisting for me to give her a chance.
