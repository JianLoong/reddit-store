I'm probably known by the students as a teacher who just keeps to the books, I don't really socialize or say more than needs to be said. Some of my peers are friends with their students but I try not to fraternize. I don't talk about my life (or poilitics, religion, etc) and try to steer class away from those topics because, in my mind at least, it's poor classroom decorum.\n\nLast Tuesday, a student asked me unprompted during class what I thought of transgender people. I don't know if they were being genuine or trying to disrupt the class. In a rare bit for me, and because all eyes were on me, I decided to be candid and said I'm not part of that world, I know nothing about it, it's probably best to judge a person on their character and merits over any label, and ultimately people should do what they want if it makes them happy.\n\nOn Thursday as class is closing up and students are leaving, the same student stopped and decided to talk to me. Completely unfiltered they said they were questioning whether they were trans and since I was their favorite teacher they thought they could confide in me. They started asking me advice, if I can look into things for them, and so on.\n\nI stopped them and said this conversation is making me very uncomfortable and I'm sorry if I gave the impression with my comment beforehand that I was open to discuss personal issues like this. I said basically that this is the wrong place to talk about these things and they should seek advice elsewhere because I'm not interested in getting to know my students beyond surface level.\n\nThey left and I did feel guilty afterwards. Was I wrong in how I acted to this vulnerable student?", "created_utc": 1681065667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12grp7l/aita_for_brushing_off_a_student_who_confided_in/", "score": 496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it is not necessarily my place to become too personal with a student, it is my responsibility as an educator to, at the very least, lead the student in a helpful direction towards a counselor and/or other local resources who are more qualified to provide that guidance. Even if you don\u2019t care about the students on that level (arguably I believe you should but to each their own I suppose), you may actually find yourself in legal trouble one day if you stick strictly to a policy of didn\u2019t ask, so don\u2019t tell, especially in matters where a student might be in danger of harming themself or others.", "YTA and here'a why...regardless of how you feel, these kids see you as a trusted adult. So there are times you will have to step out of your confort zone. This kid is obviously going through something serious and needs guidence. Even if you can't, the least you could have done was point them in the right direction. Find out places they can go, people they can talk to. Turning that kid away like that could cause some serious harm. \n\nLike I said I get its not your style, but in this case you have to forget about that. I hope you approach this student and give whatever help you can", "YTA maybe next time make a call to the school counselor and try to get them some help?", "Info if you were not well equipped to talk about the situation why not refer the student to the school counselor. Someone who probably would be more open to talk.", "YTA, you sound like just another disappointing teacher who has no business being a teacher.\n\nThis kid came to you with something really intense and hard and you didn't just shut them down you kicked them down.\n\nIts not about being open or fraternising, it's about being able to recognise in that moment someone is vulernable and asking for help and being kind about it.\n\nRejection like this damages kids for years and this kid may never open up to someone else again because of how you shut them down. It's one thing to say I don't have the skills to talk about this conversation its another to say \"I'm not interested in getting to know my students beyond a surface level\", that's cold and humiliating for a child to hear from someone they admire and trust. They said you're their favourite teacher, great way to crush them.\n\nIf you're not going to get to know these kids beyond the surface level then you're never going to be a good teacher. So many kids are coming from broken and abusive families and it's part of a teachers job to spot such abuse, you're never going to be that teacher because you don't care. \n\nThe fact that this kid came to a teacher and not a parent tells me their home life is not a safe space for them to talk about this topic and you shunned them.\n\nI think you should consider another career before you damage the future of the next generation.\n\nI know that sounds very harsh but you're just not in the right job and eventually you too will burn out and crash. You just don't have the soft skills required for the job. Your skills belong somewhere its just not in the classroom with children.", "Info: usually when a student comes and talk to me about personal problems  (I used to work in the university sector) , I would offer to accompany them to a counselor\u2019s waiting room or make an appointment on the spot for them,  if I feel their problems are beyond my capability as an educator.   \n\n\nWhy don\u2019t you go mid way and do that?", "YTA - not for setting boundaries but for the WAY you said it. Why not just say what you said when someone asked you about it in class? Just say I don\u2019t really have much knowledge on this topic then steer them in the direction of someone who might. Like the counselor.", "YTA, not for not wanting to help this student personally, but because as a teacher you have a duty of care towards your pupils and you did not live up to it here. A child who is questioning their gender identity is very likely to be experiencing mental health issues which could lead to severe downstream consequences. Depression, suicide, and many other problems are much more common in trans people than in the general population, especially in young people.\n\nPut another way: This is a child who just told you they might be experiencing a mental health crisis, and you brushed them off. If you do not feel equipped to help them, you need to find resources that can. At most schools that's a guidance counselor, or a school psychologist. If the school you are at is anti-trans in outlook (as some public schools in some places are), you might need to find another resource outside of the school, or try to talk to the child's parents (though that is its own can of worms, I realize.) Yes, it's fraught, and there's not always good options, but you also have a duty to help because by virtue of your position.\n\nIf this is in the United States, there may also be liability concerns, because teachers are mandatory reporters. You need to escalate this to someone else at your school now so that this person's problem is taken seriously, since you are not capable of helping yourself.", "It\u2019s understandable for setting professional boundaries but it\u2019s extremely unprofessional to push away a student seeking help. \n\nBrushing them off must have definitely hurt them and made them feel rejected especially by their \u2018favourite teacher.\u2019 \n\nIn the future, refer students to appropriate resources with empathy that\u2019ll help create a supportive environment rather a dismissive one for all students.\n\nLooks like you replied to someone\u2019s comment with the fact you did refer the student to a better person to talk to.\n\nYou still should have been more careful in the way you said it. I\u2019m hoping it wasn\u2019t as dismissive as it sounds in the story\u2026 if it was you\u2019re the AH.\n\nYou explain avoiding to interact with the kids\u2026 what an odd profession choice.\n\nConsider moving to teach older people that\u2019s definitely a better option for someone like you.", "Why are you a high school teacher if your clearly hate teenagers? YTA. \n\nYour students are going to learn much better from you if they can relate to you at least in some way. This vulnerable kid probably had no one else they felt they could seek help from and you completely shut them down. Way to go. You have no idea the extent of damage you may have just causes this student.", "YTA\n\nNo matter how much you want to be the McDonald's of teaching (you serve the same menu items daily, don't build a relationship with your 'customers', and then go home), your students will not see you that way. Your students are people. They have feelings. More than that, there is a difference between \"I don't talk about my personal life\" and \"my student picked ONE PERSON to trust with an important thing, and they asked me.\"\n\nFor better or worse, you chose to be a teacher and in many ways that means your comfort will come second to what your students need. It's uncomfortable to talk to someone about their failing grades or to parents about their failing student; it's uncomfortable to confront an aggressive parent, but those things are part of the job too.\n\nMaybe you've spent your life up to now doing your damnedest to ignore anything in the world not immediately related to you. LGBT+ people have a very hard time learning about being themselves. They're stigmatized. Many are abused by bad parents. They know there are risks to coming out. They know there are risks about who they decide to open up to. It is not a minor, tiny little thing to have someone questioning their gender or orientation confide that in you.\n\nDepending on where you are, there are certainly legal hazards. States like Florida have been trying to force teachers to out LGBT+ students. There is a genuine risk to a teacher in those sort of places. Then you have to be a lot more careful how you approach these matters. If you're NOT somewhere actively cracking down on LGBT+ youth, then you've got no excuse at all.\n\nThe best way to approach this in a regular setting is fairly straight forward:\n\n1. I know absolutely nothing about this and I can't tell you if you are one thing or another. That is up to you to decide. (Which is how these things go, no one can tell you exactly).\n2. I can try to find some websites for you and I can try to read a bit, but I may not be the best person for this. (Engage with the student, but provide as MANY resources for self help as possible, educate yourself so that you can treat them correctly).\n3. There are limits about what I'm allowed to talk about, please understand that. If I'm not as helpful as I could be, sometimes it's the school's policy. I couldn't teach sex ed things to students not in that class. (Set a reasonable boundary that while you're willing to help, there are things you really can't talk about. It's not about \"you\" or \"me\", but the rules of the school. Clamming up isn't a rejection.)\n\nInstead you were cold and tact-less in handling this. You didn't even try to deflect in a helpful way. It was just outright rejection. You could've said \"I know nothing about this, I'll google some things and maybe talk to the teacher running the LGBT+ club.\" (If there is one, some schools have it). Short, sweet, send them on their way and next time have a little info and maybe point them at the trevor project or something. Hand them off to the person who CAN help them that you DO trust (and be damn sure you trust whoever you hand them off to).\n\nThe damage is probably done now. I don't imagine they will make the same mistake twice.", "YTA\nEven if you were uncomfortable the way this should have gone is \n\n1) acknowledgment - \u201cthank you for confiding in me, I\u2019m honored that trust me\u201d\n\n2) set your boundaries- \u201cI\u2019m not the best person to talk to about this because I feel that I don\u2019t have enough experience or knowledge in this situation\u201d\n\n3) help - either \u201c but i know a member of staff who\u2019s in a much better position to help.

That\u2019s how they end up dying.", "I have some cousins who are teachers and I ran this by them.  Basically they said to tell the student(s), this isn't the appropriate time or place to have this discussion.", "NTA in today\u2019s political climate. Maybe you could explain that you would like to help/talk/research but can\u2019t without jeopardizing your career and point them to someone who can.

Regardless of whether or not you support that community you are a high school teacher; a mentor. Why would you ever decide to take a position that entails being the only available adult support to a group of emotionally confused young adults? They are literally at a point in their lives in which they are figuring out themselves, their world, and their place in it. \n\nMost of them (I will say MOST) are unable to discuss any personal matter of significance with their families at home or their fellow students. As a teacher, you are tasked with serving these kids. \n\nBy denying that service and saying it makes you UNCOMFORTABLE, you are possibly attributing to the problem AND confirming for the student that they have no safe place to speak about personal matters. You could have sent them to a counselor kindly.\n\nTeenagers aren\u2019t rational, but their feelings are 100% real. Do you even understand how fast that student probably internalized your comment?

Some state legislatures have passed laws that make it so that if a student asks a school official to call them by a name or pronoun other than the one assigned at birth, the parent has to be notified. Since many gender-non conforming kids are not out to their parents because it\u2019s not safe to be out, this could put a teacher on a very tough position. Like potentially lose-your-job position. Talk to someone so you can navigate the best way to help kids and protect your job so you can keep helping kids. \n\n(FYI, I live in one of those states and as an ally, I am figuring out how to navigate the new laws to protect kids while not breaking the law and potentially losing my livelihood and the ability to help kids.)", "YTA, not because you didn\u2019t want to \u201cget involved\u201d (for many reasons this could be the correct choice), but because you were dismissive and harsh to a student who chose to be vulnerable with you.

Also, they said that your their favorite teacher so they know how you like to keep things professional, so I don\u2019t get why they felt the need to ask you how you feel on a personal subject.", "1. When unsure, ask management. If there are no guidelines, tell management they need to set one. Would benefit other staff members too. \n\n2. When asked questions like this, explain to the students that it is against the code of ethics for a teacher to share your views regarding matters like this.  [You can still hear them out without offering your personal opinion by asking them questions about how they feel.] \n\n3. Follow up with an offer to help by offering or encouragung them to speak to a counselor. Refer them to the counselor. Do not ask them to find the counsellor/senior teachers. They will not because of access and thats why they came to you. Go to the the school counselor and speak to them about the student and raise the matter officially.\n\nYou can still rectify the situation. Speak to the counselor and then go back to the student and explain to him that you misspoke and apologise. For example, \"Xx, remember our previous conversation? I thought about it and realised that I did not give you proper counsel. I apologise. But upon reflection, this is what I think I can do to support you better...\"", "NTA, I would have directed them to the counselor though", "You should have sympathetically listened and directed them to the school counsellor.", "Nta", "NTA.

Instead, you should both be honest with the student about you lack of knowledge on the topic, and tell that student that their counselor might be better equipped on the topic.

Your intentions and boundaries are solid but I'm betting your delivery sucked, and that is very important in the teacher student relationship. \nWhether you are comfortable with it or not you have a relationship with your students, and your success and their success is highly intertwined in that relationship. \nRelationships are built on trust, communication, and yes, vulnerability. \nYou can have solid boundaries about what you can and can't discuss, but you need to tread very lightly in how you implement them. Saying you are uncomfortable when someone divulges intimate identity info to you is probably never good for a relationship.

I don't want to let you down so I want you to talk with our counselor because she is trained in this\" but saying you're uncomfortable is very likely to translate to that student that they are making you uncomfortable, and that is not the right think for them to assume in that moment, for their growth and yours.

I'm probably known by the students as a teacher who just keeps to the books, I don't really socialize or say more than needs to be said. Some of my peers are friends with their students but I try not to fraternize. I don't talk about my life (or poilitics, religion, etc) and try to steer class away from those topics because, in my mind at least, it's poor classroom decorum.\n\nLast Tuesday, a student asked me unprompted during class what I thought of transgender people. I don't know if they were being genuine or trying to disrupt the class. In a rare bit for me, and because all eyes were on me, I decided to be candid and said I'm not part of that world, I know nothing about it, it's probably best to judge a person on their character and merits over any label, and ultimately people should do what they want if it makes them happy.\n\nOn Thursday as class is closing up and students are leaving, the same student stopped and decided to talk to me. Completely unfiltered they said they were questioning whether they were trans and since I was their favorite teacher they thought they could confide in me. They started asking me advice, if I can look into things for them, and so on.\n\nI stopped them and said this conversation is making me very uncomfortable and I'm sorry if I gave the impression with my comment beforehand that I was open to discuss personal issues like this. I said basically that this is the wrong place to talk about these things and they should seek advice elsewhere because I'm not interested in getting to know my students beyond surface level.\n\nThey left and I did feel guilty afterwards.

If you are teaching teens, you need to be aware of who your target audience is, if not for sympathy, at least for professionalism. By doing this, you will realise that young kids could come to you for advise, because they think if you are good at teaching, you must be good at passing other kind of knowledge. They don't realise (yet) that life it's more complex than that. In order to avoid hurting the kids feelings, which also will probably have an effect on their education, you might need to work in your pedagogical skills. That's is part of teaching. That way you can \"reject\" them, while still making them feel supported.\n\nIf you are not willing to be more professional in aspects like this, you might want to consider doing something like research, where you can express a lot of knowledge and passion for knowledge without really caring about the feelings of your audience.

I don't care about qualifying labels like trans or LGBT because it says nothing about a person. Although if it does say something about your person, then I view it sort of negatively, because it shouldn't be something so important so as to encompass your identity whole.\n\nAs an LGBT person, yeah this would be ideal! However, it is largely people outside of the community that make these labels matter. I'm not sure if it's lack of exposure or willful ignorance, but these statements show a severe lack of knowledge and perhaps a lack of empathy for the LGBT community. I'm happy to point you in the right direction of where you can find good resources to further expand your understanding of these things.", "I have a great position for you. They have teaching programs in adult jails. They need teachers, the students will not be asking you about trans questions. You\u2019re providing them with knowledge for when/if they leave. And you get to teach, which is what matters the most to you. \n\nThis may be a huge win for you.", "> Only boring people think something out of their control should be anything but a footnote in their life.\n\n....Maybe it's different where you live, but that \"footnote\" can indicate whether a person receives adequate health care, whether they can marry, if they can adopt children, and their likelihood of suffering from homelessness and violence. People who \"make LGBT issues their identity\" aren't doing it because they're boring, they're doing it because *the rest of the world won't leave them alone about it*. \n\nMaybe you should consider that this position also stems from ignorance. If you do not fully know the struggles this group faces, how can you label them as boring for caring so much about their identities?", "All that is great, you seem really into yourself and your craft which is lovely and so important. What you lack that an educator (specially the ones teaching teenagers)  should have is empathy. You don't need to be their friend and you shouldn't be but this interaction you has could make or break this person's view of their life. You might not like it but being an educator puts on that spot sometimes and part of your job is to lead with care and empathy.", "Ah yes- everyones favorite teacher made the curriculum accessible but made it very clear they hate their students as individuals and paid no mind to their mental health and well being. Got it. The cognitive dissonance here is astounding. You\u2019re not going to have a fun career, buddy.", "It's absolutely heartbreaking. If a teacher treated my trans kid like that I'd turn them inside out. Unfortunately, this kid probably doesn't have a mom like me. YTA, op.", "In that case OP could get in trouble for supporting this kid at all", "Yes, you are absolutely right, and that should be the focus here.", ">robably shouldn't inject politics here, that'll be another thread...\n\nBut why not, if OP is living in a Red State, then OP is right to keep things impersonal between them and their students.  If OP is residing in a Red State, they risk getting fired or prosecuted for talking anything about sex or race.  Hell, it's even on the news how OB's are leaving Red States and country hospitals are closing maternity wards because of these insane laws.", ">I\u2019m not from the US\n\nAnd thank your lucky stars that you aren't a teacher or an OB in any of our Red States.  Teachers there have to be very, very careful that what they say, including suggesting counseling on sexuality, won't be taken as that teachers is advocating LGBTQIA influence.", "Everyone you worked with was a good teacher?", "I agree somewhat, but even this is kinda not great? I think OP could've left the last bit out, maybe just let the student know they feel honored that they were comfortable enough to share and offer to help them connect with counselors if they wanted.   \n\n\nOP didn't need to be a counselor. OP just needed to treat their student like they aren't a robot. Also, I do think OP could benefit from learning more about LGBT issues. This likely won't be the last time something like this happens.", "You sound like a very good mum \u2661\n\nEdit; Why am I being downvoted for complimenting someone?", "\u201cThank you for your trust. I am in no way qualified to get you the support you deserve, so let\u2019s talk to the counselor tomorrow\u201d would be neutral enough to not be seen as pro-trans, but would also not harm the student if they really need help.", "I'm in Australia. Hit me up, I'm always happy to help people in the US migrate here. I feel for you guys", "If you can\u2019t talk to children about personal topics then you probably wouldn\u2019t be well-suited to being a teacher, I\u2019m sorry to say. \n\nSchool is not just about book-learning, but about developing social tools as well. For many children school is their only safe place, and their teacher might well be the only adult they can trust and rely on. That\u2019s by definition an intimate personal relationship, and sometimes uncomfortable topics crop up. \n\nAgain, if a teacher is not equipped to handle a certain topic, they can certainly make referrals to trusted sources of information, and other trusted adults. But there\u2019s a respectful and dignified way to do this that still honours the trust and bond with the child. OP put their personal comfort above the emotional safety of the child in this case - by being so cold they have probably caused that child to shut down, and very likely not seek support from a trusted adult again for fear of similar rejection.", "A part of classroom management is building personal relationship dynamics with students. Did they not cover that in your teaching school?", "Astounding that teaching chews up empathetic people with difficulties (like me) but holds on to people like you. \n\nYou have no business being a teacher if you're this shallow and unempathetic.", "Because the majority disagrees with it. YTA", "You're pushing a lot of people's buttons in this thread, that's for sure.  \n\n\nYou know there are a ton of students who don't get as much parental/familial/general adult support as they need, right? And you probably recognize that an under-supported kid with whom you connect on an intellectual level is likely to develop bonding feelings toward you, right (\"favorite teacher\")?  \n\n\nA lot of people in this forum are incensed that anyone would be allowed to be a teacher who doesn't welcome such bonding between teacher and student. You might be the only adult that kid ever really connects with, their one chance to have really deep, vulnerable conversations with someone who's got a little bit of world wisdom. They might connect with you and never with a counsellor. You being \"uninterested\" in the personal side of things may be a small but genuine tragedy in that kid's life.  \n\n\nI think you need to reconsider how to most gently redirect students who want to form a \"favorite teacher\" bond with you. Don't just give them the name of the counsellor. At the very least, can you get to know the counsellor or another of the more \"genial\" teachers and make yourself into a real bridge and connect the next student who comes your way directly into a more welcoming relationship with a supportive adult? Introduce them personally, hand them off directly, give them some words of encouragement that this is also someone they can trust?\n\nConnecting with students on a personal level is not small or ancillary. For a lot of students, it's the most valuable and important thing they'll get out of their education, if it works out for them.", "So my kids tell me. ;) (And you can't imagine how much that means to me!)", "What the actual fuck?", "Assuming the counselor is a decent human being", ">Hit me up, I'm always happy to help people in the US migrate here.\n\nI would move there but you guys have BIG ASS spiders and snakes \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude06.", "How do you guys feel about lesbians? \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s hard to blame the teacher if you see what\u2019s happening around this country.

Before even starting hormones, she changed her appearance to be more feminine. I was worried for her, because I've read the statistics and there can be some not so nice people around. It would fill my heart to hear her talk about the old lady who complimented her dress etc. She's a lot further in her transition now, and from what I am aware, hasn't experienced any hate or discrimination. I know she may be the exception and not the rule, but it does make me feel like this next generation might be ok. I'm in healthcare too, and I shut down any shit real fast.

In my initial post I made the differentiation between \u201cobligation\u201d and \u201cmoral obligation\u201d and that is definitely my bad, because I never meant to do that. My argument has always been based on a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d and I failed to make that clear in my initial reply and my many failed attempts at clarification. \n\nI didn\u2019t think he was legally required to report anything at any point, and I never thought he was *criminally* negligent although I didn\u2019t help that assumption by providing the legal definition for \u201cnegligent.\u201d \n\nI probably could have left \u201cmandated reporting\u201d out of all of my other replies too. It meant very little to what I had to say other than it established the principles of my argument. \n\nOP is not legally responsible for anything. Based on the principles of some of his other requirements as a teacher, I feel as though he denied a moral obligation to help. He\u2019s an AH. I\u2019m a bit of an AH. Sorry for the confusion"]}
