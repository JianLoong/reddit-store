I understand that you feel that he's replacing your dad, but have you actually talked to your mom on how you feel about him? How it was too soon for you?   \nMaybe you need family therapy.", "Imma say NTA, so imma say you lost your dad about 11 months ago, and you mum started seeing someone 10 months ago, and is now married, that\u2019s a lot of emotions to deal with alone especially at 16, emotions that most adults can\u2019t handle (losing a parent) from what you\u2019re saying she\u2019s trying to force you to accept someone you don\u2019t even get along with and hasn\u2019t even tried to do that (expecting you to call him dad from the get go) so also adding into someone else adding to your problems and grief would make any 16yr old act out, so I think you should be using alcohol and weed to deal? Definitely not! But what 16yr old acts accordingly when they obviously have no one to help guide them the right way when going through so many emotions? Not a lot that I know.\nI\u2019d suggest finding a family member that loves you and you trust to go stay with so you can finally mourn your dad the right way, and get the guidance you need with life, life is hard but it doesn\u2019t have to suck, you just find happiness through the chaos (not relying on drugs or alcohol) find a hobby that help you regulate your feelings and emotions (sports, games, dancing, creative arts, etc) but also makes you feel good and happy and pushes you to do better in life.

You should have just accepted the ultimatium and stayed away from the wedding, whatever it cost.

Being 25 minutes late and making out with a guy assured that you got the negative attention you sought.\n\nIt\u2019s not all on you, though. They shouldn\u2019t be forcing a picture perfect wedding when you are broken behind the scenes.\n\nIf they couldn\u2019t be happy with your absence, they should not have been surprised by your angry adolescent presence, but you\u2019re hurting yourself more than them.\n\nAre you an only child? It\u2019s too bad your mom couldn\u2019t prioritize you and her own grieving process during the first year without your dad.\n\nYou need to see a grief counselor on your own, if not with your mom, and find healthy outlets for your emotions. Drinking or using to cope with the pain you are feeling will only bring more pain.\n\nIt can get better if you allow it.

You however are the least bad here.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "Does that happen often? You drinking and other stuff? I find it odd that your mom wasn't more shocked that her 16 year old child showed up drunk as a skunk, and stoned.", "NTA.

My stepson is 18 now and I wouldn\u2019t interfere in his love life but my friends have teenage daughters and if some creepy adult decided to take advantage of any of them whilst under the influence and used my wedding to do it\u2026 well, I guess I\u2019d find out if you get a discount by combining a wedding with a funeral\u2026", "ESH.

It is one thing to arrive at an event and become drunk, it is another thing entirely to decide to attend drunk to begin with. You are 16 so depending on where you are you shouldn't be drinking anyway. You really need to reflect on \"everything is way better when you're drunk and maybe a little stoned\" because that attitude can become a problem quicker than you think. \n\nI don't actually think the making out with another fellow was that bad. Romance happens at weddings. \n\nHowever, you arrived late so you interrupted the service and everyone saw you were pissed. You could have got there on time and just swayed silently so only the people close to you might have noticed. \n\nIncidentally, arriving late to a wedding and interrupting the ceremony is always bad even if you are stone cold sober and your only sin was underestimating the traffic. If it happens you creep in apologetically and sit at the back or listen at the door.

You sorely need therapy, but it\u2019s incredibly expensive and presumably mom pays the bills.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly tough position to be in. Try to find relatives or trusted adults who will have your back and help you make an escape plan. The second you\u2019re 18 you\u2019ll need to be out the door if you want to keep your sanity, and to do that safely you need savings and a plan, a safety net and backup options.\n\nGood luck, you\u2019ll need it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Grief can take years. I get her grief clearly doesn\u2019t allow her to be alone, it comes in different forms. But she can\u2019t expect you to be happy about it.\n\nDo yourself a massive favour and get therapy. You need it.

Worrying.\n\nYou're sixteen and miserable right now so I'm saying this next part in a \"grain of salt\" kind of way but: I developed a drinking problem at twelve and it was rough. I'll admit I'm honestly not too worried without much more info on your end because 1) you're grieving a very recent trauma and 2) being a teenager fucking sucks ass, but if you find yourself unable to handle your day-to-day without drinking, I _do_ hope you reach out to someone. It can really take a hold of your life and make things worse if you're not careful. \n\nI only wanted to say something because I know that sometimes a dependency can sneak up on you after a trauma, and you don't deserve that. I recently lost my best friend and struggled with a relapse after over 20 years without any issue, and it's scary. But if you just mean it generally \"life sucks rn and it's a wedding so I can get away with being drunk\" then it's not necessarily worrisome. \n\nMy heart just goes out to you, man.

Escapism never pans out well for folks. \n\nIt's shitty that your mom moved on so quickly (I wonder if she herself is having a trauma response).  Asking you to call him Dad is insanely inappropriate. Their inability to see that you're a child who is grieving a great loss and dealing with a major life trauma, is concerning.
