If my guy left me right now *(we have 3 dogs, he's got 2 kids, and we are both painfully aware that I am the biggest problem with keeping the house clean because my craft stuff migrates around the house)* if he took time to clean the house with me after moving out with his kids and one of the dogs, I'd be over the moon... but it wouldn't be expected. At all. Like, I would be surprised if we even continued speaking to each other...

He turned down your offer, you don't owe him anything else.", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds emotionally abusive and it\u2018s good that you got away. You\u2018re already struggling and he can deep-clean the house for himself, you aren\u2019t his servant.", "YTA - You made him move across the country with you even though you already wanted a divorce, then just pack up and split?", "His wife walked out and he's worried about the deep clean?\n\nYou're absolutely NTA, and I'm glad you finally got out", "NTA about the cleaning, but it is a bit out of order letting him move across the country and him leaving his family and friends when you were already thinking about leaving him. That\u2019s a bit below the belt considering you\u2019ve now moved back and left him there.", "NTA he sounds like my ex husband. Glad you got out!", "ESH. You can ask your husband to hire a cleaning service to deep clean the house and then split the bill.", "So let me get this straight...he's angry not because you left, but because you didn't clean the house before you left? Wow. Good call on leaving. I would offer to pay for half of the cost of a professional cleaning crew, if I were you.", "NTA - you left and the only thing he's mad about is you didn't clean before you left? Whatever! would be my response.", "NTA for leaving or not cleaning. I would add the fact that you offered to fully pay for cleaners to your post, though. \n\nIs his issue (the one that cleaning \u201cdoesn\u2019t help\u201d with) that he needs to move back or has no support system? Because that\u2019s understandably frustrating. As long as he\u2019s okay with where he lives and able to survive solo, you\u2019re good.\n\nDid he keep the dogs? No bearing on the ruling, I\u2019m always just concerned about every dog for some reason.", "NTA\n\nYou moved out. The house is his responsibility. Tell him to hire a cleaning company if he is really that mad about how filthy the house is.", "NTA and he\u2019s doing a great job affirming your choice to leave.", "NTA - it sounds like your ex is emotionally abusive, and that abuse is continuing as you move out.  the fact that he is mad about the state of the house is just a projection of the mess he has made of his life.  it's his problem to deal with.", "\ud83d\ude06\n\nIs your husband waiting for you to go back once a week to cook, clean, do some laundry, walk the dogs, buy his groceries?\n\nYou just left him.

We\u2019ve been together since we were 19 & 20, and we moved several times together. I can understand that it\u2019s hard to do things like this alone, but that seems to be the main reason he\u2019s mad at me which hurts. \nThe dogs will be with me once he moves. He\u2019s moving to a different state completely alone (by choice) and I\u2019m going to go out there and drive back with him and the dogs so he doesn\u2019t have to do it alone.

How would that make any sense if he was the one driving the idea?  You allowed him to make a major life decision contingent on you two being together when you were already planning to leave him.   That's an asshole move, full stop.", "How does that \"not\" help him? That makes absolutely no sense. Hes complainging the house isn't clean. You offered to hire someone to come clean it. Literally \"helping\" him to not have to clean. I would suggest blocking him and getting on with your life.", "LMAO what a loser. NTA in the first place, but it was very generous of you to offer this and his reaction to the offer doubly makes him an asshole.", "This comment says it all. NTA.\n\nYou're equally responsible for cleaning up the place. That doesn't mean cleaning it yourself, particularly if it means you have to spend time dealing with him. By offering to not only pay half (which could obligate him to spend money he doesn't want to), but the full fee, he has absolutely no right to complain whatsoever. \n\nSounds like leaving him is a great investment in your future!", ">I already offered to pay the full cost of a cleaning service and he refused\n\nDodged that bullet.  Don't offer him any more money.", "Are the dogs going with you?", "Ugh, I feel you there. I\u2019m really sorry, but it sounds like you did everything you could and are making it as easy as possible for him. I hope everything goes smoothly for you and you\u2019re safe solo traveling. \n\nAnd, hey, all else aside: good luck on your fresh start. I hope the new chapter is happier, easier, and less lonely.", "I would rethink that. Send someone else to get the dogs. NTA", "Because it was still a good opportunity and a good job\u2026? My point was that he wanted to move and would have been mad at me had I not taken the job. That sounds pretty toxic to me, so yeah I considered just going without him but thought, hey, maybe moving will make him happier and therefore will make him be nicer to me", "It's probably because he knows he's losing the live-in maid he doesn't respect.", "I couldn\u2019t take them initially due to logistics but am going back to get them and drive back with them.", "Thank you so very much <3"]}
