We don\u2019t live together and I am the sole provider for our daughter and my son. He works long hours and has to maintain multiple properties that he owns, so she never stays with him and he visits her mostly during the weekends. He does pay for her babysitter which costs $150 a week so I can go to work and so she can be taken care of while I\u2019m away. Besides that, he will occasionally buy groceries for us or buy her diapers as she is still potty training. He does not help with anything else financially. My salary is about 1/3 of what he makes a year. Finances have been tight here lately with the economy and just having to provide for 2 kids. I recently asked him if he would be willing to pay child support for our daughter since he doesn\u2019t help take care of her and he only helps with paying for her babysitter. He blew up about this and got really offended saying \u201cshe is already taken care of\u201d even tho I\u2019m the one that takes care of her and accusing me of trying to be petty by asking for child support. He mentioned my ex husband and asked why the child support he pays isn\u2019t enough for me, but that is not enough for both of my children & I am only now asking for help due to how expensive everything is starting to get. He claims that him paying child support would put him in a bad place financially and that I should just break up with him if i\u2019m going to put him on child support. But, he makes triple what I do and i\u2019m already in a tough place financially and he only has to provide for himself while I\u2019m supporting a family of 3. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking for more help or is him paying for babysitting enough?", "created_utc": 1689361018, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zourb/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_pay_child_support/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Basically letting you alone with the kid, you aren't living together despite a 3 years relationship+having child together...\n\nYou need to have a long hard look at your relationship.", "INFO: Why are you still with someone who is showing you that he will never make his child a priority?", "Honestly, this is a better question for a lawyer. Right now he is contributing roughly $600/month plus groceries and diapers. I would do research and consult someone more familiar with the child support procedures in your area. You don\u2019t want to shoot yourself in the foot by pursuing formal child\nsupport and wind up with him being ordered to pay less than what he is contributing willingly.", "NTA\n\nBut you are the asshole for not thinking of your child and getting childsupport from your deadbeat baby daddy.\n\nIt's not for you, it's for the child. Get your shit together. You're a mother now.", "Not quite sure what he makes or what the child support laws are in your state, but if he is paying $600/mo plus contributing to groceries and diapers which may add an additional $200/mo, that is $800/mo. Before you get courts involved, make sure that he will end up giving you more than that. Otherwise, the courts could say he only owes you $500/mo, for example. Again, this depends on his income so it he makes a considerable amount then we know he will be able to afford more.", "Yeah, dude needs to pay child support. How are you paying a babysitter $150 a week? Is this daycare, are you outside the US, is your babysitter a family member doing this at a discounted rate, are you working 10 hours or less?", "NTA.  As said above, get a lawyer.  Are you sure this guy is only dating you?", "NTA. He needs to cough up the dough, and the courts would agree. That said, the term \u201cchild support,\u201d while totally fair and accurate, may be triggering for a dude who still seems to have one foot in bachelordom. If your goal is ultimately to get his cooperation, maybe soft-pedal the language(without lowering your financial expectations).

Get a lawyer, establish child support and visitation. Your relationship is secondary to the needs of your child.", "You're NTA. You need a formal agreement on the support money to protect your child and yourself. \n\n$150 a week for child care? He is getting off incredibly cheaply. Where I live $600 a week is a steal.", "NTA. I have the feeling you're in a hard position many mothers have to go through. Do what you can to survive and take every measure you can to care for your children and yourself. It's best not to overthink your actions about whether or not you come off as an a-ho, sometimes being nice can really backfire.", "Yep, I think he's right. You should break up with him, and serve him a formal request for child support.", "NTA. Maybe he is right about breaking up with him, though. Do you really want to be with someone who won't take care of his daughter?", "Uhhhhh\n\nNTA\n\nGo to whatever agency in your state handles child support. They will help you file a claim. That\u2019s all you have to do. No lawyer necessary.", "NTA, He is already paying at least $600 a month.  It's hard to know whether that is a reasonable amount of child support without knowing how much he makes.  But I think it's time to formalize the child support process.  What you have right now doesn't prevent him from leaving you high and dry if he gets pissed off at you.", "NTA. I would do exactly what he recommended, break up with him and contact a lawyer. You need to take care of your daughter because he is certainly not.", "NTA but please be aware.. Depending on what his documented income actually is, the child support order may be for less money than what he is paying per month in child care. Your daughter absolutely deserves to be cared for financially (and otherwise) by her father. \n\nYour circumstances seem very suspicious in that he doesn't mind paying $600 per month for child care (but it's 'off the books'), he doesn't see her except when he comes to visit, and leaves the parenting to you. Honestly, OP? This reads like you might be the other woman that he's trying to hide from his actual spouse.", "YTA sounds like he pays quite a bit.... 150 a week plus groceries. That's around 800 a month depending how much groceries are. You can go to court if you want and they will maybe award you more, but then he obviously won't be your boyfriend anymore, because you took  him to court. Depends what's more valuable to you. But saying he doesn't pay anything was a bit disengenous...", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing petty about getting the $$$ he\u2019s responsible for providing your child. It sounds like his $150 plus groceries is significantly less than child support. It also sounds like if he has to pay full rate this relationship isn\u2019t worth it for him. You have to weigh what other forms of support he\u2019s providing that may go away and decide what\u2019s right for you.", "Why are you not living together when you have a child together?", "ESH Take him to court and get a child support order already!", "Hahaha... 'break up with him if I'm going to put him on child support'??? Hilarious.\n\nPlainly he doesn't know anything about how that all works. He needs to be paying an appropriate proportion of his salary to you, to *support your shared child*.\n\nNTA", "WTF?? Are you for real? Get a lawyer and get child support, it's not his decision!", "NTA for asking for more but most the time the court will make each of you responsible for 50% of daycare and you might get $300 for support you do the math. The courts might not give you anymore.", "Exactly - NTA but call a lawyer asap", "Why do you even bother calling these kind of people your boyfriend is beyond me ...", "My question is why aren't they living together if they are \"together\" and share a child? Like I understand coparenting when you aren't together but if you're dating and have a child together you should absolutely live together for the sake of the child", "He has only bought groceries for us 3 times total, and he makes 6 figures a year I don\u2019t know his exact salary i just know it\u2019s over 100k a year.", "It is a family member helping at a discounted rate, I work 40 hours a week.", "No worries! He is the biological father and yes he pays $150 a week for the babysitter which is $600 a month.", "I said he occasionally buys groceries for us, he has done that a total of 3 times. I acknowledged that he pays $600 a month for the babysitter, but he does not spend an additional $200 on her.", "He\u2019s just a placeholder until the new boyfriend impregnates her.", "Very true! My guess is she's not the only woman in his life.", "That is a very nice family member;)", "Ahh okay, with you.\n\nNTA\n\nI'm from the U.K, I can't really comment on if $600 alone in babysitters is a lot, (I mean to me personally it does sound a lot) but looking at some other comments It looks like that isn't a lot for the US and it's often even more expensive.\n\nAlso, is it normally socially acceptable in the U.S for parents to charge each other for child support, even though you're still together? Here in the U.K that's typically for when couples seperate.\n\nIt's concerning to me that you've been together for 3 years and still in seperate homes, despite having a young child together. Is there a very good logical reason and explanation for that? It just doesn't sound very supportive, and for him to say he'll break up with you if you ask for more support financially because you're struggling, that is even more of a red flag.\n\nAs a man with a child, I just couldn't imagine doing this to my partner and thinking this selfishly. And you said he owns multiple properties but said if you asked for more money it will financially cripple him? Maybe I'm ignorant, but I can't imagine a person that owns multiple properties is strapped for cash?\n\nIt sounds like you're a separated couple and he's a weekend dad...but you're not and still together. It all just seems a very odd way to live OP. Was this mostly his idea on the living and relationship arrangements, or whas it a joint agreed decision for good reason? If mostly led by him I'm really sorry to say, but this isn't normal behaviour at all and very concerning, and you absolutely deserve better", "OK. But he contributes. How much do you spend on groceries for your kid? More than 600 a month? Point is you have a decisions to make: work with him and try and get him to contribute more/spend more time with you and the kids OR make him a paycheck via lawyers and instantly loose all contributions until a court mandates it. Plus loose your boyfriend. It depends what you value more. How much are tou getting from your other kids dad?", "Oooh curve ball! Could this be a side chick and they aren't in a \"proper\" relationship?", "It isn\u2019t normal to live separate and still be together while sharing a kid in the US. The issue with living together is he isn\u2019t willing to compromise on WHERE to live. I don\u2019t want to force my son out of a school he loves and away from his other family. He currently lives 40 minutes away in a small town with little resources and i live in the nearby bigger city with many more resources. He says he doesn\u2019t want to live too far from his mom, but it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me since she is perfectly fine on her own. I wish he\u2019d be more willing to compromise on where to settle our family, if I were to move to where he lives I\u2019d most likely have to quit my job due to the commute and i\u2019d be without that income.", "Yeah....OP you've got a bad one on your hands here.\n\nAs a family man, I'm only happy when my family is happy. You've got yourself a little Weasel of a man. Get that money, get rid of his ass and squeeze everything you can.\n\nSeriously how fucking dare he put you in this stressful situation with 2 kids  struggling financially whilst he's essentially living the bachelor's lifestyle stress free, and then has the audacity to say he'll break up with you if you ask for more money! OP does that really sound like a 50/50 partnership?", "Does he have another girlfriend?", "*wife", "That's a distinct possibility.", "Yeah this might be the case. The blow up from the dad would make sense if child support meant he would essentially be outed"]}
