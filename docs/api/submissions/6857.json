Instead of coming home in the evenings and helping me out, he helps me out in the morning and allows me to sleep in and wake up slowly while he spends time with them. When I get up, he goes to bed. He has no issues with the system and feels comfortable asking me to do it when he feels he can\u2019t. But this morning, he was there with them. \nHis grandmother has been texting our daughter (11) and asking about the comings and goings of our household. She then texted me \u201cWhy are you not up with my granddaughters?\u201d She knows our situation and dynamic so I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s an issue. I didn\u2019t want to argue or fight with her so I did not respond. She then called me an hour later and once I said hello, she again repeated herself. \nWe love her and appreciate her support but I felt boundaries had to be set. I kept my emotions in check and simply stated that we don\u2019t like her using her granddaughter for information. I told her we love her and appreciate her, and that we don\u2019t want our relationship to be like this. My voice was even and controlled. I don\u2019t handle confrontation well so I was shaking and having a hard time getting it out. But she got off the phone very quickly and after trying to talk it out with her over text I\u2019ve given up. I\u2019m trying to be as mature about it as possible but there\u2019s nothing I can do if someone won\u2019t listen and stop throwing around insults. I don\u2019t want to live in a fish bowl.

It\u2019s nice for your husband because he gets time with the kids before they are distracted by the day.  You handled it well, time to walk away.  Kudos to you for not rolling over.", "NTA and as parents, you HAVE to put your foot down, when others interfere.", "My child\u2019s grandmother used to be like this\u2026 on my ex\u2019s side. Because she had too much influence over my daughter because of her deadbeat father throwing my child on her during his visitation time, she also saw herself as my child\u2019s mother. She\u2019s always wanted me eliminated, and she has been trying to take my place for many years since he and I were married. I eventually had to block her for my own sanity because she also started constantly gaslighting me just like her son would do.\n\nShe had sick and twisted reasons, but because everyone is different, I can\u2019t say for sure why your daughter\u2019s grandmother is being this way, but what I can tell you is that she has way more influence and power over your child than she should. It\u2019s very apparent that your child\u2019s grandmother is getting information from your children she otherwise shouldn\u2019t have, and the only way to curb this behavior is to cut off the source of contact- and that means that the only solution to this is to block her from your children\u2019s phones. \n\nThis is not supportive behavior. It is overbearing and is a 100% attempt to control you and your parenting. If she continues to hurl insults and to break down your boundaries, the only other solution for you to stop this is to take it upon yourself to finally block her. If you don\u2019t, she will continue this because simply putting your foot down will never be enough for her.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am not a morning person, never ever have I been one. He also let's me sleep while getting the kids ready for school. I rarely see them in the mornings before they catch the bus, besides them coming in our room to give me a hug goodbye. This works for us. \n\nI'd be blocking granny from my kids devices and having hubby have a little chat about boundaries! She does not get a say in how you raise your children.

What you have got is uncontrolled child conversations going on without your presence with his grandmother. That is what you need to stop. Phones are a luxury not a necessity. Remove her from their phones. No more unsupervised calls to granny. She doesnt need to be contacting you during the day either. You have a person actually invading your life and controlling you from a distance."]}
