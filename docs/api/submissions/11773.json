He's the baby of his large family (11 kids). His oldest sister has an 18 year old daughter who is expecting a baby. Niece is Elizabeth. She's a really sweet person and she and I have been close since I met the family six years ago. She was always a huge fan of my name. Astrea. She liked how uncommon it was and she admitted that her parents thought my name was dumb. She talked about how boring her name was and wished she had one like mine. She told me she's loved to name her future kids like me one day. I thought it was sweet. SIL and her husband have often used my name, alongside my older brother's name, as examples of \"dumb things people name their kids\". Older brother is Finch. All my siblings and I have names that my ILs don't exactly love. But mine and my older brother's name get the most mentions in that context. My husband has told his sister before to knock it off and we even took a small break from her over it.\n\nWhat happened is a few weeks ago SIL started ranting and raving at me about how it was all my fault her grandson will have a ridiculous and atrocious name and that she hopes I'm proud of myself. That my incompetent, dumb as fuck parents who had no idea on what a name is and how to plan for a kids future had started her daughter down the same path as them and she told me I should never have let her daughter think my name was a good thing or that I wasn't made miserable by it. She said I might pretend but even I know my parents were sick for doing it and should be ashamed of themselves for saddling me with it and that I hate them deep down for it. My husband told her to get out and not to come near us again.\n\nOur niece called upset and we talked. She was saying how her parents were trying to get her boyfriend to talk her out of the name they had chosen. I told her that the name she chose was lovely and that I could speak from experience that it is possible to grow up loving your more unusual name and not being held back by it. I encouraged her to follow her heart and name him what she chose. She asked to speak to my younger brother, who has the name she chose and is the only person she ever heard with it. It made her feel better. SIL went on a rampage with the rest of the family over what I said to her though and some of my ILs believe I was wrong to undermine her. My husband said she was being vicious for no reason and was out of control.\n\nBut did I handle this all wrong?

And why does she feel entitled to insult your whole family?\u2019\n\nNTA.", "Your sister in law needs to stop acting like her grandson is her kid, as a mother you can be asked about names but you don\u2019t get the final say and they need to shut up about it NTA", "NTA\n\nastrea is actually a very lovely sounding name. kid me would never make fun of such a pretty name.\n\nthough your in laws show exactly what type of people they are. bullies. its amazing your husband and niece turned out ok among those people.", "NTA - VICIOUS!? Your ILs are being very dramatic for people who so highly value highly boring names. You're being supportive to a family member who is being hurt and bullied by their family members! I sincerely hope your niece and her BF do what feels right to them, since theirs is the only opinion that matters.", "There are worse names. Someone in my high school was named \"Apple\" if you can believe it. NTA", "NTA but it's funny that they would include your name with \"finch\" i would say finch is a dumb name but yours isnt lol", "NTA the niece is going to be the mother of the child. Her child.  All you did was provide support to her that her own mother failed to do.  Someone came to you in pain inflicted by her own family, and you gave support. \n\nAs for undercutting the girl's mother. You bet and wear that one with pride because someone sure had to do it!", "NTA, I was saddled with a very common name, and I would have loved one a bit more unique growing up (I almost did get a very different one but my grandparents would have been VERY against it lmao). Cove is a lovely name", "NTA at all\n\nBe prepared to become an \"honorary\" grandma. Elizabeth just might tell mom to take a flying f%$&.", "NTA. Are they seriously mad at you all for not hating your names? lol. Your SIL is a mess and good on you and your husband for sticking up for your niece!", "Cove sounds like a lovely name!", "NTA. My son has an unconventional name. He's 12 and loves it. It's who he is and everyone that meets him loves it too. I've noticed many kids in his classes have unconventional names too. (However, should he hate it later in life, we thought forward enough to give him a \"normal\" middle name he could use instead.) \n\nMy husband and I have very overused names and we hate it. They're very dated and you can't throw a rock without hitting another person who shares our names lol", "Cove!   Usually I\u2019m an \u201coh no, please don\u2019t be creative on a name a sentient being must carry for decades\u201d person but ooh, this name is pretty cool.   \n\nRegardless, being supportive of a soon-to-be mom\u2019s choice is usually a good decision.   NTA.", "NTA Here\u2019s something on the first name Cove.

You are also allowed to give an honest answer to an adult who asks you a question. SIL has just decided that her opinion is fact and you must be lying since you disagree, I have a lot of family members like that and it sucks. \n\nThe second thing is while I do have the reaction that some names are probably not a great idea. BUT cove and astrea and finch wouldn't even make me think twice. They are perfectly fine names. I reserve that judgement for obviously crazy spellings, those people who name their kids after sounds, and naming a kid dishwasher. In all of those cases those are quite thoughts I keep to myself or maybe make a smart joke to my wife in private and thats it. The only time I do say something is when its obvious cultural appropriation, like I really shouldn't be naming my lilly white kid something like aang just because I like ATLA or Muhammed because   hypothetically I am a fan of boxing.\n\nEDIT: forgot to add I think your just as likely to have a future kid angry at you for a common name as you are a unique name. Both outcomes are in my opinion than a kid being okay with their name because well its just that their name and I don't think most people think that much about it.", "Astrea, Finch, and Cove are all gorgeous names I\u2019m absolutely jealous of! I have a \u201cboring\u201d first name and wish I had been named something more whimsical and unusual. It\u2019s a big responsibility naming another human but you and your niece are NTA. SIL needs some perspective and to be less judgmental about others.", "NTA I'd cut off SIL just for the audacity of saying such despicable things about your parents because of your name. I don't care what she's named, she opt to be called by bad terms to accurately describe what she is.", "NTA I love Cove, i do love the water but he was a main character in the Our Life Beginning And Always so I am EXTREMELY Biased", "Nta. And is she actually threatening to cut her daughter off over a kid's name?! Wow.\n\nCove is a lovely name. I hope she sticks with it.", "NTA\n\nCould be worse, Cove could be a middle name and first name Al.", "NTA. She will get over it. My cousin named is daughter \"Miley\" and we were all wierded out by it at first. We didn't say anything to him and his wife. We just let them name their kid. And guess what, we don't ever think of Miley Cyrus when disucssing her.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds like a petty, small minded person. She sure did project a lot of her own fears onto you and your parents. That's her problem. Your niece comes to you to talk because you are kind and trustworthy. Something her mother doesn't offer. Thank you for being that for her.\n\nHopefully, SIL will love her grandchild enough not to be the one that bullies them over their name.", "I love different names, and once knew a guy named Dasher. He carried that name with confidence and had tons of friends. He's a very successful man and sometimes I think the names help.", "NTA.\n\nIf it comes up again, especially with other family members around, say something like: \"You know what, Elizabeth? Maybe naming your baby something unique might not be a good idea. They might have people like your Mom treat them terribly and talk badly about them because they are not mature enough to handle names that they aren't used to. Some people think seeing a name they don't like gives them permission to be mean in response.\"", "NTA. That name is dumb, but i've heard worse. Sister-in-law is going to far with it and needs to stop before she gets omitted from her future grandkids life. SIL is being a major asshole.", "NTA\n\nAlso, your niece and her BF are grown adults, and they are the ones who will ultimately raise Cove.", "Nta. I used to work a place where i saw a lot of baby announcements. A lot of unusual names came up but the only ones i thought were bad were ones that were culturally inappropriate, dont name your midwest white family's white baby a traditionally hawaiian name, or fandom things, i cannot tell you how many khalesi are out there because i lost count. \n\nI dont see anything weong with Cove. I think it's nice sounding, easy to read/pronounce, and has a nice definition that could make for some really cool artsy things for the baby room/ gifts while growing up. I do hope the kid likes water.", "NTA and the parents of a pregnant 18 yo need to STFU about bad parenting.", "NTA. As someone who has a name everyone mispronounces and i hate it, I\u2019m offended asf that they told you YOUR NAME is horrible. I get mad people mispronounce my name bc it\u2019s my name, it\u2019s my identity. It\u2019s bare minimum respect for a person to just get that one thing right. I\u2019m not the best at remembering names, but I try my hardest to always use a persons name bc everyone likes being called by their name. And the name is question isn\u2019t conventional, traditional, or biblical (where most names come from) but it is able to be pronounced! And easily! Imo I like it! but it doesn\u2019t matter what I like, however I feel so bad for baby bc if they talk shit about these other peoples names, they\u2019re just gonna talk the same shit to this baby it\u2019s whole life. That makes me sad.", "NTA", "NTA. I grew up with a very common name and my English class had 3 other girls with my name. Very boring and I wish my name was unique. I named both of my children unique names because of this. I think Cove is lovely and she should do what she wants! My family teased me about my sons name (I was pregnant at 17) and after he was born and growing up they thought it was so fitting for him.", "Just like art, names are subjective. What one person likes the other won't. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your SIL sounds insane. \n\nWhen it comes time for your niece\u2019s daughter to learn about name differences, I hope she reads the Chrysanthemum book! It was wonderful for me as a kid. Just some love from one uniquely named gal to another. :)", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was give your niece reassurance that she should trust herself. Your SIL can rant and rave but it's your niece and BF's decision on what to name their child. Sorry that you are dealing with grief from your IL's.", "First off, Elizabeth us not a boring name. I personally can\u2019t think of a name that has more nickname options. Secondly, all the names OP mentioned are far from being weird names. SIL has issues. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I would have seriously gone off on SIL.  That is some high level douchebaggery right there.  I have heard some terrible names, but none of the names you have talked about seem that awful.  I think you handled it all quite well.  Start calling SIL \"Plumpkin\" if you ever get to introduce her to someone. \n\nYou- *Hi good to see you again!  This my SIL Plumpkin Johnson.*\n\nYou should stay friends just so you can do this even once.", "NTA.\n\nShame on you supporting her daughter when she isn't. SIL is TA.", "Cove? she is flipping over the name Cove????? Good grief. I was thinkng it was going to be something like Asphalt. Sorry you have deal with this nonsense. NTA", "NTA. If they aired business it's open for input. But I don't always give my opinion when things are publicly aired. Perhaps have a convo with neice about keeping private debates more private, or being more selective about who she shares with. But SIL is an absolute asshole that made it a personal attack. Nothing is wrong with your name, your parents, or you. Her, same can't be said.\n\nAlso I once met a man named J. That's a stupid name. The only stupid name I've ever heard. For the rest of his life people will correct his paperwork to ask for the full name or ask if it's short for something.", "NTA - I have a \"normal name\" that my father chose and that I hate beyond reason. I was 1 of at least 7 in my grade with name, no matter what school I was in and always got saddled with the worst nicknames because my initials together were not a \"school appropriate\" name - AK apparently being indicative of violence and AB sounding like bullying. So now, I am in the process of paying to get it legally changed to what I have wished was my name for over 20 years. All 3 of my siblings have beautiful unique names that they adore, but not me. My children now have unique names that they all love, and don't share with anyone in their grades. \nThe in-laws are dicks and just want control. The baby is not theirs. They get less than zero say in his name. Anyone who thinks otherwise needs a reality check.", "Usually in naming kids unusual name situations I try to think of ways that the name could be made into something rude or how the child could be bullied with it. \n\nYou\u2019re safe with Cove. I tried for a while too. NTA", "I actually know a few Cove\u2019s both men and women. May Not be that popular to hear it as often, but it\u2019s definitely not a name pulled out of a hat. It\u2019s a lovely name", "I have a friend with that name and he never had a problem with it. No one ever even thought it was weird honestly", "In the UK it would provoke more of a reaction as a cove is a person who receives stolen goods. At least in Victorian times it was. Now it might be used in the phrase 'a rum looking cove' as in someone who was odd looking and up to no good. Still like the name though.", "On every job site I ever worked there was at least one person named mike or Steve.  Usually there was both.", "For a second I thought you were saying you\u2019ve never laughed at any name more than you laugh at the name \u201conceb\u201d lol here I am trying to pronounce it like a dolt lolol", "That\u2019s not even bad! As a teen, I ran in a circle with a girl named Bountiful Harvest. That\u2019s just cruel. \n\n\nNot that her brothers had it any better as Immaculate Perfection and Supreme Judge\u2026\n\n\nOP is NTA. Many unusual names are incredibly charming and those kids love to have them and Cove certainly isn\u2019t among the challenging or embarrassing unusual names.", "I love mine and my siblings names so I don't consider them terrible at all.", "Only my opinion, but at first I thought it was not a good option... Bay, sounds better for me, but then I remembered Cabot Cove, and I loved that series, and so, wouldn't you propose Cabot Cove, to your sis on my behalf??", "my year at sleep away camp when I was a kid was only 31 girls and six of them were named Sam. A little variety is a good thing, especially if they choose a more traditional sounding middle name in case the kid decides to go by it later.", "At age 6, we had three people with my name, all next to each other in the register. And one of the other two also had the same last name initial as me. So they were \"Name P\" and I was \"Name Pr\" and the third was \"Name R.\"\n\nI always hated having someone else in a class with my name because it was so easy to get confused about who people were talking to/about.

My college choir had 7 Christophers one year.", "The fact that she has no tact and has been vocal and rude about your name and your family names and now is doing the same thing to her daughter and future grandson speaks loads about her.
