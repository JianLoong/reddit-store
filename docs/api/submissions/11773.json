He's the baby of his large family (11 kids). His oldest sister has an 18 year old daughter who is expecting a baby. Niece is Elizabeth. She's a really sweet person and she and I have been close since I met the family six years ago. She was always a huge fan of my name. Astrea. She liked how uncommon it was and she admitted that her parents thought my name was dumb. She talked about how boring her name was and wished she had one like mine. She told me she's loved to name her future kids like me one day. I thought it was sweet. SIL and her husband have often used my name, alongside my older brother's name, as examples of \"dumb things people name their kids\". Older brother is Finch. All my siblings and I have names that my ILs don't exactly love. But mine and my older brother's name get the most mentions in that context. My husband has told his sister before to knock it off and we even took a small break from her over it.\n\nWhat happened is a few weeks ago SIL started ranting and raving at me about how it was all my fault her grandson will have a ridiculous and atrocious name and that she hopes I'm proud of myself. That my incompetent, dumb as fuck parents who had no idea on what a name is and how to plan for a kids future had started her daughter down the same path as them and she told me I should never have let her daughter think my name was a good thing or that I wasn't made miserable by it. She said I might pretend but even I know my parents were sick for doing it and should be ashamed of themselves for saddling me with it and that I hate them deep down for it. My husband told her to get out and not to come near us again.\n\nOur niece called upset and we talked. She was saying how her parents were trying to get her boyfriend to talk her out of the name they had chosen. I told her that the name she chose was lovely and that I could speak from experience that it is possible to grow up loving your more unusual name and not being held back by it. I encouraged her to follow her heart and name him what she chose. She asked to speak to my younger brother, who has the name she chose and is the only person she ever heard with it. It made her feel better. SIL went on a rampage with the rest of the family over what I said to her though and some of my ILs believe I was wrong to undermine her. My husband said she was being vicious for no reason and was out of control.\n\nBut did I handle this all wrong?
