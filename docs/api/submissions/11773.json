He's the baby of his large family (11 kids). His oldest sister has an 18 year old daughter who is expecting a baby. Niece is Elizabeth. She's a really sweet person and she and I have been close since I met the family six years ago. She was always a huge fan of my name. Astrea. She liked how uncommon it was and she admitted that her parents thought my name was dumb. She talked about how boring her name was and wished she had one like mine. She told me she's loved to name her future kids like me one day. I thought it was sweet. SIL and her husband have often used my name, alongside my older brother's name, as examples of \"dumb things people name their kids\". Older brother is Finch. All my siblings and I have names that my ILs don't exactly love. But mine and my older brother's name get the most mentions in that context. My husband has told his sister before to knock it off and we even took a small break from her over it.\n\nWhat happened is a few weeks ago SIL started ranting and raving at me about how it was all my fault her grandson will have a ridiculous and atrocious name and that she hopes I'm proud of myself. That my incompetent, dumb as fuck parents who had no idea on what a name is and how to plan for a kids future had started her daughter down the same path as them and she told me I should never have let her daughter think my name was a good thing or that I wasn't made miserable by it. She said I might pretend but even I know my parents were sick for doing it and should be ashamed of themselves for saddling me with it and that I hate them deep down for it. My husband told her to get out and not to come near us again.\n\nOur niece called upset and we talked. She was saying how her parents were trying to get her boyfriend to talk her out of the name they had chosen. I told her that the name she chose was lovely and that I could speak from experience that it is possible to grow up loving your more unusual name and not being held back by it. I encouraged her to follow her heart and name him what she chose. She asked to speak to my younger brother, who has the name she chose and is the only person she ever heard with it. It made her feel better. SIL went on a rampage with the rest of the family over what I said to her though and some of my ILs believe I was wrong to undermine her. My husband said she was being vicious for no reason and was out of control.\n\nBut did I handle this all wrong? AITA?\n\nThe name in question is Cove, just for anyone who wonders.", "created_utc": 1678271584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11lsxqw/aita_for_telling_mymy_husbands_niece_that_her/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.", "NTA. It's not a bad name like the family thinks it is. If the mother and father of the baby wants that name they should be able to name him without having so much hate for that. Your SIL is a AH. It's not like they are trying to name the kid Fireball Tree or something weird like that ig. You're trying to be supportive and that is not a AH thing to do. They don't wanna blame their kid so they have you to blame bc it's easier than accepting the choices her daughter is making.\nI say to keep being supportive of your niece if that's what you wanna do. When the baby gets to the world, the family neither calls him by his name or don't call him at all. Theirs choice and nothing to do with you at all.", "NTA. What a nice name.

She had no cause to go \"on a rampage\" and make assumptions about your experience with your name.", "NTA - my name is Michael, one of the most popular men's names, which means that in any professional setting there will always be at least one other Michael (and very often 4-5 or more). It is generic and no one will remember you because of your name. This is honestly true for most people I know. There is a TikTok creator names Astrea and as soon as your name popped up their videos came to mind.

Frankly, this isn't her decision. It's your niece's. You're not undermining your SIL because your niece is an adult who can make her own choices. I'm glad that she has someone in her family who supports her. Just keep being there for her and go low/no contact with your SIL until she decides to speak to you like a rational adult.", "NTA, reason is obvious to any sane person I would think.", "NTA It is not a name I would personally choose, but it will be better than being the fourth Olivia in their kindergarten class.", "NTA.\n\nA couple \"names\" are coming to mind that would accurately describe your SIL and all of them are much more common and a lot worse than the names in this post.\n\nYour husband has it right. Your niece is a legal adult who can make her own decisions and take whatever advice she chooses to. She asked for yours and you were honest. Your SILs opinion on baby names is not a parenting decision. There's nothing to undermine.\n\nSome parents are crossing some lines when it comes to choosing uncommon names but nothing like that is happening here. The name in question is somewhat unusual but not insulting and easy to spell and pronounce. The only delusional ones are your ILs", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual F?\n\nSIL needs some chill pills. And you were very kind to give your niece (-in-law) some much needed backup and reassurance.", "Absolutely, unequivocally NTA.

Reminds of RPG i just cant think which one", "NTA, and for what it's worth, I think Cove is lovely.", "NTA. My sister and I (F) both have unusual names that my parents picked off of tv shows. And we both love our names. I have heard off much worse names than Astrea (some of the Covid baby names were atrocious. Astrea sounds like something directly out of one of my favourite fantasy books!!", "NTA. I kinda hope the boyfriend comes around on the name. The only two opinions that teally matter in the end are your niece and her boyfriend. Two yes and one know on the name is the advice I see a lot here.", "NTA. It seems like your SIL wants a perfect cookie cutter family with perfect little grandkids and you\u2019re \u201cthrowing a wrench\u201d in that public image she\u2019d like to display.

Your SIL sounds like an insecure piece of work and I'm so sorry about her shite attitude and comments. I'm glad your husband has stuck up for you, and Elizabeth seems to have an appreciation her mother lacks.", "NTA\n\nThere is no undermining. This is supporting a grown woman to make her own choices.

I wouldn\u2019t choose it but it\u2019s nothing to be ridiculed over\u2026 I mean if it was something just sad like Hashtag or something I would be in agreement that isn\u2019t okay. Cove isn\u2019t that. It\u2019s a decent name. \n\nTell them to be happy it\u2019s not a girl named Silver Beach Morningstar Everleigha Mari Lou (last name here) lmfao. \n\n^ my old highschool classmate named her daughter something similar to that. Wasn\u2019t that exactly but was the same length\u2026. And the first three were her first name, next three were middle then generic last name (think Smith). They also have posted about how she will never be called a Nickname in their household. So that\u2019s where I think the line should be. Don\u2019t be bat shit like that.
