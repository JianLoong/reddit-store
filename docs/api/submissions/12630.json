When she was younger, we hosted a huge sleepover for her birthday every year. Lots of food, they stay up late watching movies and talking, etc. That obviously took a couple of years hiatus when the world shut down. Now that things are better, she\u2019s asked to do it again.\n\nCurrently, my sister, Nanette (36F) and her husband, Tony (36M) are staying with us for a few months. His company put him here through June to help start up somewhere  nearby. As they live hours away, it made sense for them to come here. And as we had the room, we offered for them to save on rent and just stay with us. They usually have dinner with us, we hang out watching tv, etc. \n\nNow that Victoria is getting older, she\u2019s asked that we not be around during the party. My husband and I agreed to duck out after the food is put out and we\u2019d be upstairs if they needed us. Usually the girls hang out in the den so it\u2019s fine. \n\nTony will be working that night. I told Nanette to please either stay in her room or go out that night so the girls could have their privacy. She said she doesn\u2019t want to be exiled to her room or forced to go out. She said if she needs to come into the kitchen or living room for anything, she will. I said kitchen is fine but take anything out of the den she needs ahead of time.\n\nShe said that we may feel free being \u201cprisoners\u201d in our home, that she won\u2019t. This spiraled into a bigger problem that she feels Victoria has her friends over too much. They never us to ask us to leave the room then, they\u2019re always polite and kind. But yes, it does mean we often have teens in the pool or raiding our fridge. Overall coexisting around us. We love having the kids here and I will always provide snacks and such. My argument is, I\u2019d rather them be safe here then out doing who knows what.\n\nNanette feels that her feelings should be considered and until they leave, teens need to be over less. She also said she would come in and out of the den as she pleased.\n\nI told her my house, my rules. She then went and complained to our mom who says that Nanette is my guest and I should respect her. To me, a guest is a week at most.

Your sister is staying rent free she can abide by this rule for one night it is not unreasonable.  I don't have kids but you are 100% correct in wanting them to feel comfortable hanging out at your house.

I'm all for being a gracious hostess, but there is also being a gracious guest.  A teen lives in your home, so her friends will be there.  Your sister is not the parent, so her opinion really doesn't matter.  And, to complain to mom shows her level of maturity.  Suggest she visit mom that evening, or treat herself to a night in a hotel.  It is unreasonable to expect your daughter to forgo her birthday party.", "NTA.

It seems as though she has overstayed her welcome.", "NTA. As you said, your house, your rules.", "NTA. She is your longtime guest and should act like a guest by respecting your rules. She can sleep in a hotel room for that one night or for the whole time if she is not okay with your house rules! Your daughter is more important and it is her house too, not the house of your sister.", "NTA. Sounds like you have 2 teens living with you though. Your sister is being petty.", "NTA. Here's a wors for your sister: hotel.", "NTA - if sis and BIL can\u2019t manage to make themselves scarce within the house, they can get a hotel for the evening.

Your sister and her husband are guests in your home. Considering that you are being so generous, they shouldn't be making demands about how you run your hose. You are not asking them to be prisoners in their own room - you are asking them to give your daughter and her friends some privacy for a night - this is not an unreasonable ask.\n\nAlso, as a guest, your sister does not get to demand (or complain about) hoe often your daughter had friends over. Again, she is staying there temporarily, this is your daughter's home.\n\nThis is also between you and your sister - there was no reason to bring your mother into this, other than your sister hoped to use peer pressure to make you change your mind *because she knew she was being unreasonable*.

All this is going to do is put a wedge in her relationship with her aunt, but it sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t care about that anyway.", "I\u2019m sorry what? Absolutely NTA. You are correct, your house your rules. Your sister who is THIRTY SIX called your mother because she doesn\u2019t like your rules?

Your sister is hardly a \"prisoner,\" as it sounds like the adults can go everywhere except the den. \n\nSince they have been there so long, I think they should have input into the running of the household. Are the other kids over too much? Are they noisy? Would it be possible to compromise and have them over a bit less?

I skimmed the first part and thought Nanette was Victoria's older sister until you mentioned her being a guest -- wtf.

Did you not know who your sister was when you agreed to this? If you did then that's where you messed up. You invited her to stay for an extended period of time and expected her to change who she is. Your sister is TA for her entitled attitude. Honestly if she doesn't like it her and her husband need to look for other accommodations. But it sounds like more of a her problem than a them problem.

Victoria lives there and is allowed to have friends over as much as she wants. If your sister has a problem with the rules for your home she is welcome to leave and find other living arrangements. Also telling her to please give the kids some privacy this one night isn\u2019t asking much. While I agree that banning her from the kitchen and den completely is much it isn\u2019t out of line to say that the kids have the den for the night and she should try to avoid needing to go in there. And there is a difference between want and need. She might want to go watch tv in the den but that shouldn\u2019t be allowed but she might need to get the phone charger she left and forgot about until her phone showed low battery in this case she is allowed to grab the charger and move along. Also you are only restricting her to not bother the kids ( that she doesn\u2019t even want to be there) so why is it a big deal", "NTA. It\u2019s your house your rules.

That is your daughter's home, NOT your sister's, and I'd be damned if any family member staying in my house - for free, at that - would be telling me how to do anything in my own home. \n\nTell your sister she has two choices: stay in her room as you've nicely asked her to do (for one freaking night, good God) or rent a hotel.

Nanette is a guest in your house so if you are requesting she not go in the den while your daughter is having her birthday party then she should honor that.

She can gtfo and rent if she doesn\u2019t like it!", "NTA  let me guess, Nantee is your mothers favourite!  Why else would she get her Mommy involved in this kind of matter.

OP was probably gaslit her whole life by her mother and possibly father to think she was the crazy one when she tried to stand up to her irrational sister. That is a very real thing that happens in a lot of families and sometimes it takes getting older and having your own kids to realize what a messed up situation you grew up in. Standing up for herself and her daughter by kicking the sister out is the right thing to do but it will have huge ramifications on her family dynamic.
