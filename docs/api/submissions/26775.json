You literally have no claim to it, or can make any decisions regarding it. It doesn\u2019t even come from your side of the family. \n\nStomp your feet all you want, it\u2019s Elise\u2019s choice what to do with it now. \n\nGrandmother didn\u2019t like the idea of teen mothers, and made sure that behaviour wasn\u2019t rewarded. Sucks, but that\u2019s how it is.", "YTA, you have no right to question what other people do with their money and keep your nose out of other people's business.", "~~NAH. (except grandma, but she is dead)~~\n\nYou are being a good father, wanting both children to have something.   Your wife is trying to play switzerland.\n\nHowever, it seems grandma had other ideas.\n\nThat said, I think you can have your opinions, but you should stay out.   You can advise Elise one time about it.  And say something like \"look, if you take all this money, legally you can do that, but you may be ruining your relationship with your sister\".    At that point though you need to let her make her choice.\n\nThis money was left to her, so it needs to be up to her what she does with it.   You can be disappointed in her choice.   But you still need to let it be her choice.  And frankly, I don't know that I'd call Elise and AH if she kept it all.\n\nMy grandmother had many grandchildren.  I got more in the will than others when she died.   Me and her were very close.  I don't think I was obligated to make it equal.\n\nEdit: Changed to YTA when it was revealed in the comments that they are step sisters, so Elise came into the family later.  That part makes a huge difference here.  You are essentially mad that \"your\" daughter isn't getting the same thing as your wife's daughter.  Yes, I understand you adopted Elise, and your wife adopted Rae, so they are both of your kids.   But being a blended family definitely is something that should be made clear.", "Yta. Grandmother went to give to Elise she can. The grandmother is no way obligated to give money to Rea. And neither is Elise.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your decision. It was your mother\u2019s.

Do you really need to perpetuate more bad feelings over the will by pitching fits over it?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your place to decide how someone else divides their estate. Your MIL had every right to place whatever wacky parameters she wanted on the trust. \n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking that Elise had to undergo a hysterectomy at a young age\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean that the grandmother \u2018set up\u2019 Rea to fail. Rea made her own life choices.\n\nPushing for this is not going to \u2018bring the girls together\u2019, it\u2019s only going to increase the tension and create animosity. \n\nIf you are truly disturbed over the money, sit the girls down and discuss setting aside $15k from your own estate for Rea. It\u2019s the amount that she would have received from the trust, had she met the terms. Elise gets her $15k plus Rea\u2019s share now, and eventually gets $15k less during the division of your estate. \n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect solution, but it seems better than tearing your family apart by fighting the trust or badgering Elise to give her sister $15k.", "YTA. I get that you're unhappy, but this is not your choice to make nor your choice to impose. That's not how trusts and wills work. Talk to an attorney, but in all likelihood the only way for this to be lawfully distributed is in accordance with the conditions of the trust.", "YTA. This was your MIL will and she is the one that showed favoritism and both your children are old enough to understand this. However, this is her money and her will.

You pushing for something else might ruin the relationship of your daughters.", "YTA \n\nYou have absolutely no say in this inheritance.

This is not your place. Fighting this will only lead to greater animosity between you all.", "YTA it's not your money or inheritance", "YTA - this was your grandmother's decision, not yours.", "YATA\n\nIt is not your money. Please honor her wishes and let it be distributed the way she wanted it to.\n\nAlso, she is also kind of an arsehole for setting it up that way, but that doesn't change the fact that it was her money and that is how she wanted it distributed. \n\nIf Elise decided to give something to Rea, then that is fine (the money is hers after she inherits it), but I don't think you should've even hinted it at.", "YTA, unless there's some sort of mental impairment or other legal way it can be contacted, the will is the will no matter how it sucks.\n\nMaybe she \"favoured\" as you put it Elise because they shared common interests, and why would she give tools etc to Rea of she's shown no interest in that kind of thing (which you don't explicitly say but I'm guessing that's the story).  \n\nElise can, unless there are stipulations in the trust as to what she can use the money for, do with it as she wishes. If she's wanting to split it then fair enough.  YTA for trying to pressure her into doing with it what you want her to", "Kinda YTA- You may be right. But you do not get to make the choices when it comes to someone else\u2019s will. Every single thing you said may be 100% true. But it\u2019s NOT your place legally or morally. Some people suck. My grandfather passed 2 houses down to my cousin. But he moved states and can\u2019t afford them neither can my father or uncle. But, my grandfather specifically told me that I don\u2019t get anything after he passes because I wasn\u2019t blood and I\u2019m a girl. So even though I could probably save those properties I won\u2019t. They aren\u2019t worth it and as I was reminded more than once, they\u2019re not for me. Is it shitty? Yea. Is it fair? No. But I did not make those choices and they were not mine to make in the first place.", "\u201cThere isnt much, about $30,000\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nYTA- If MIL and Elise had a better relationship and MIL wanted Elise to have the money then so be it.\nIts a legally binding will so you\u2019ll just have to swallow it.", "YTA\n\nYour MIL didn't even *meet* Rea for almost a decade.

Curious how you left that part out.\n\nIf MIL really wanted Rea to have nothing, stipulating that she not have a child before she 21 seems like a pretty low bar to set. Regardless of whether or not it was a \"trap\", it's *her* will and *her* money. Elise has no moral obligation to share the inheritance she got from what sounds like a very influential, close loved one who passed away.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s not your money it\u2019s not your choice.

No one denies your mother-in-law's bias toward your youngest. Nevertheless, you have no legal claim to the inheritance and while you can offer your opinion, Elise is well within her rights to claim her inheritance in full and not share.", "YTA\n\n She can give her money to whoever she wants...", "YTA. While it may not be fair, it was your MIL money to leave to whomever she wished with whatever conditions she wished.", "YTA \n\nClearly grandma only saw the biological relative of hers as her grandaughter \n\nWhich yes sucks for your daughter but grandma doesn\u2019t have give your child anything in death and she clearly didn\u2019t do anything for her in life either \n\nWay to bury the lead with only one of the girls is actually related to grandma OP", "YTA You have no business overriding a dead woman's wishes.\n\nYou are about to split up your family over money that doesn't belong to you \n\nIt must be overwhelming to be so greedy", "Rea not having a hysterectomy is not the reason she didn\u2019t get the inheritance.

I spoke a lot about how unfair things were and not becoming like the MIL. OP, you completely buried the lede. Rea is not your MIL's granddaughter, and if I understand correctly you aren't Elise's father. You're completely the AH. Elise owes your daughter nothing, you don't get a say, your daughter doesn't deserve anything from your MIL.\n\nYTA. Elise is making something of herself and you raised a teen mom.

I\u2019d like to point out that said child was in existence when your MIL was alive (given the child is two, and your MIL passed away a year ago, and one presumes there was a nice solid 10mth pregnancy before that too). As such you MIL had a chance to change her will and didn\u2019t. So these are her last wishes.\n\nAll of this said\u2026 your MIL has made her path in life. But no one says you cannnot make your own stand with your own resources. If you feel that Rae deserves more for some reason, then you be the one to meet that need. FWIW\u2026 Rae will have children, and advantages from you for that, and Elise won\u2019t, and will have other advantages. You cannot split everything down the cent equally because clearly your two daughters are going to have very different lives. It sounds like one is having a family young and early, the other won\u2019t at all and instead is gardening and building a career.  \n\n\nEdit for Judgement: YTA. MIL made her mind up, you can\u2019t change that. You can change how you support your daughters going forward but you can\u2019t alter someone else\u2019s last will.", "YTA. MIL saw little of Rae and did not encourage her to make poor decisions. I am not sure how you think she set her up to fail. But even if she had explicitly excluded Rae, you are still the AH. \n\nYou and your wife decided to adopt each other's kids; your MIL did not. Elise is her granddaughter with whom she has a close bond and shared interests. Rae is the child of her daughter's husband. You seem to have a misguided idea that you can force familial bonds. But your MIL does not owe your daughter an inheritance.", "YTA .. step \ud83d\udc80", "I guess opinions will differ on that one.\n\nI go with YTA. It is the will of the grandma. While she failed one of her grandkids in affection, it is still her will and her will alone. Also this will not retroactively \"fix\" the problems between rhea and her grandma, whats done is done and you all can just move forward becazse time doesnt flow back. You do you love both your children, that is enough. Also, it sounds like rhea and elise have no problems with each other and with gradma, it is more your problem because you feel it is unfair (which it kinda is, to be fair). If you keep insisting om elise splitting the inheritance, you might drive a wedge between the two over money (where there does not need to be one). \nAlso, it sounds like elise is sustaining a business? Doesnt she need the money more? \n\nNow, if rhea needs urgently money and this is the only pot available, i might change my judgement?\n\nThat grandma failed rhea is out of the question btw, that sucks of course.", "Glad I looked at comments before judging.\n\nYta, huge yta\n\nYour wife adopted Rea, her mother did not, her mother is under no obligation to leave her anything, but she still did anyway with the stipulation that neither get pregnant, so Rea knew she was out of the will. \n\nEven if she left her nothing though, it was mil's money,  and she can divide it however she wants, and she wanted to leave it to her granddaughter. Stop being an entitled leach.", "ESH except for Elise and Rea. Grandma seems a little harsh (can\u2019t inherit if you have a child before 21? WTF is that?) but Elise is under no obligation to give anything to Rea if she doesn\u2019t want to. Yes, it would be kind of her to do so, but it\u2019s not up to her.", "Do you know what Elise's intentions are after the fact? What is the relationship between the two? If this happened to me and my sister (in fact, something similar did happen sans kids of our own), we may not \"fight the will\" but we'd figure out a way to ensure the other had access to the money. Do you know if Elise has had such thoughts? And while, yes, it's OK for you to be angry regarding the principal of the matter (who wouldn't be?), you could be wasting anger or insulting Elise's integrity when she already has some sort of \"plan\" to do right by Rea and her kid.\n\nObviously, just speculation and projecting the relationship I have with *my* sister onto your daughters. I also don't Envy Elise for all of the inheritance tax she's going to end up paying between the property and money... yeesh.\n\nIt all sucks, so much. And I can't imagine the hurt Rea is feeling right now. I can totally see with the Y T A people are coming from and agree with a lot of their points. But for the sake of being protective of both kids and to see the best in Elise by \"expecting\" her to share (one of the basic teachings parents try to pass onto their kids), I can't help but think you're NTA for just being a parent who wants the best for both kids.\n\nKeep in mind, money can make people do... irrational things. Especially when you bring hostile anger into the matter. While defending Rea, you don't want to ostracize or ruin your relationship with Elise. This is easy come, easy go money. And regardless of the outcome, have faith in Rea to persevere, despite the blow this is. You NEED to go into this level-headed to prevent casualties.", "NTA. I think your expectation is fair. You probably can't force your daughter to share, though. Is there tension between her and her sister?", "Nta\n\nI can understand why you are peeved and would be the same. You cannot force your daughter to split the money, but you can choose to leave an unequal amount in your own will to make up for your MIL's pettiness.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. \n\nI disagree with the notions that because Rhea was adopted (still as a child!) she is worth less, that having had a child young makes her worth less, or that your MIL\u2019s legal right to do whatever she wants with her money absolves her of being an AH if she distributes it unevenly. \n\nI also don\u2019t think Elise is absolved if she takes the money and runs. If I got a family windfall of that sort I would feel like I wanted to share it more equally, because the situation would feel so unfair. Maybe not 50/50, because it\u2019s hard to let go of money once it\u2019s in your hand, but something. \n\nAll that being said, I do think you should stay out of it. Your children are adults. Your MIL was an adult. Your wife is an adult. You are verging on being TAH by trying to control their actions and adding strife over a relatively modest sum of money. I\u2019d advise you to let it go - if it works out such that it isn\u2019t fair, well, sometimes life just isn\u2019t fair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's also a solid chance that Grandma did what she did anticipating that reality.", "OP buried the lede. Rea is his daughter, but his wife adopted her.

The trust was set up a decade prior. Daughters are now 22-21, so the trust was set up when the two children were adopted. At that time Elise went through hysterectomy but that didn't mean that Rae would be disqualified - it seems that the only certain thing MIL was smart to ensure was that Elise will get share of the inheritance no matter what. It was Rae's share that was under question with her potential choices before she turns 21.\n\nStill think OP YTA. You are not entitled to decide what should happen with your MILs money.

That's what I get for browsing AITA when I first wake up and haven't had enough coffee yet, I miss details like that (and haven't spent time in the comments).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally understand the fondness that comes from having a shared interest. But I'm an idealist, and I can't help but project. \n\n(and, honestly, I don't have or want kids, but I think the whole \"having a kid before 21\" clause is dumb AF, especially without contingencies for circumstance - which maybe there ARE, but I dunno, I'm not these people).", "What kind of relationship has Elsie had with her step sister growing up?", "Ahhh.......... Yikes... That makes things much different (and more difficult). It's like once people start planning for a wedding, they put blinders on. Suddenly, nothing is more important than this big, over-hyped party and it's the only thing that matters (and they expect others to believe it's the only thing that matters, also) and often breeds this kind of temporary narcissism... Wouldn't surprise me if she *genuinely thought* Rea would *want* the money to go to the wedding.\n\nI absolutely do not envy your situation. Sorry, man.", "Stop protesting the will. And don't try to make Elise share the money with Rae. That would make you a massive AH.", "Yes, I learned that now as well. I still think OP is not an A for wishing things were different. They can't force the daughters to share anyway.", "Buried the lead with that one, eh.", "And now the real explanation comes out.", "Ok, that makes a HUGE difference then.   \n\nSo what I'm gathering is that Elise is a child she has known since birth, and Rae married into the family?  If that is the case, then yeah, you are being ridiculous.", "Technically\u2026 also known as officially.", "And the provision added to the trust that any one having a child before the specified age was clearly not targeted to one child in particular.

I feel it\u2019s not too hard to say \u201cNot before 21\u201d. There\u2019s a mountain of evidence around quality of life outcomes for mothers - the longer they hold off that first kid the better their lives are overall. The higher the level of education they attain, the more they have time to mature mentally/emotionally etc. It\u2019s not perfect, but sub 21 seems to dramatically increase the likelihood of single parenthood, poverty, multiple children increasing the cycle.   \n\n\nMIL should reward any child that takes time to finish their education, gain further experience or qualifications and allow themselves ot reach adulthood (by modern standards) before procreating. It will mean that the resources she puts into that child will provide a better long term return on the investment.", "When this was set up, Elise would have just been through surgery. They would have been 12 and 11-12.", "Plus Rea is not the grandmothers biological granddaughter.", "Thank you for the comment.  I wondered when the trust was set up.

They\u2019re stepsisters", "In the comments he slipped it in.", "In a later comment he revealed that Elise and Rea are stepsisters. Rea is OP\u2019s bio kid, his wife adopted Rea but Rea is not related by blood to his MIL. Elise is OP\u2019s wife\u2019s bio kid and OP\u2019s step daughter.

At the end of thr day, even without the step situation, mil had every right to give whatever she wanted to whomever she wanted. As parents, you have to be fair in your will, but as grandparents you don't have to give everyone the same ammount. Not to mention that she did left both the money, with the request that they didn't have a child before 21 and step niece had a kid nevertheless.", "They are both legally and emotionally my wife and I's children.", "Yep, MIL was actually generous to give Rea the opportunity to inherit half her estate, despite the fact that she and Rea were not close nor blood related.", "OP (who is TA definitely) mentioned that Elise had had a hysterectomy around the time the trust was put up and the kids were adopted. So Grandma would have known that Elise would definitely get inheritance, but Rea was under question.", "So your logic is that MIL looked at then 11 year old Rea and plotted an evil plan to dangle an inheritance in front of her but in her heart of hearts knew for certainty that your daughter would \u201cfail \u201cand get pregnant just shy of 21 years? You think MIL is smirking now. Don\u2019t you think that this clause was put for Elise rather than your daughter, that despite the hysterectomy, grandma had fears and hopes that maybe she\u2019d get pregnant defying all logic. A girl at 12 having her uterus removed before understanding what a uterus does is not the security one hopes for for a daughter or a granddaughter.", "So then what precisely is the issue? She could not have known your daughter would be a teen parent at the time. Having kids early leads to worse outcomes for parent/child and the gma provided an incentive for your daughter to make a good decision here. Given that you think 30k is not a lot of money, you are probably from a socio economic bracket where teen pregnancy is very uncommon - again, from the Gmas perspective this was probably a very low bar to clear.", "So the only thing grandma was sure of is that Elise could not be disqualified. And it seems you (the family) kenw about this provision, and Rea still decided to have a child earlier and forego her part of the inheritance.\n\nYTA for expecting your step daughter to fix the mistake your bio daughter made.", "So if she wanted the money, why did Rhea then have a kid before 21?", "Your daughter knew the consequences of being knocked up and went for it anyway. Why's this anyone else's problem? Did she think it would make her life easier?", "You hope grandparents will treat blended-family kids the same but it\u2019s not exactly surprising when they do make a distinction, esp. in their will.\n\nAnd Rea could have inherited half if she hadn\u2019t borked the morality clause. That\u2019s the way this particular cookie crumbled.", "Ah, thank you. I still don't think OP can interfere between the two of them. This is on the one that the grandmother favored now.", "That makes for a whole different story, then. He's got more resentment than he wants to let on. In my family, that adopted child would have been treated the same by a grandparent, so I understand his feeling, but he can't interfere with this will. Both of these young women are adults now and he needs to stay out of it.", "Grandmother probably took the lead from her granddaughter.  Still Rea had every opportunity to get her share of the money.  It was her choice not to fulfill the terms of the will.", "Basically you\u2019re child just looked up to Elise. They weren\u2019t close. Why should she share with your daughter?", "Changes nothing about how Elise\u2019s bio grandmother felt about it. It appears she didn\u2019t approve of Rea. \n\nKinda crazy foresight to add a pregnancy clause on there, and then have it play out exactly how she predicted\u2026.", "You consider that to be true.  Plus just because Elsie seemed to accept it doesn\u2019t mean she was fine with it.  Plus what kind of relationship does Rea\u2019s biological grandmother have with Elsie?  Plus there is your fact that your daughter didn\u2019t meet the terms of the will.  Was the will written before she got pregnant?", "But not both your MILs grand-children. She was under no obligation to leave your bio-daughter anything, but was still prepared to do so under the sole proviso she didn't have any children before the age of 21. If your MIL did actually set this up with some malicious intent, she must have been a pretty good judge of character.", "\nYea but it's not like it's hard not to have a kid before you're 21.", "Yeah but generally people wait until after 21 to have kids, so it\u2019s not really the gotcha OP thinks it is.", "She knew Elise could never have children when she set up the trust.", "Yes, she was all of 11 when this was made.", "Long before - per OP she was 11-12", "And she predicted that your daughter would be a teen mom.", "She did not know (but likely suspected) that your other daughter would be a teen mom, and seemingly wanted to give her an incentive not to be. That was her prerogative. Given the fact that you left out the bit about blood relations, and the fact that Gma predicted the teen mom outcome, I think you are likely leaving other relevant info out. \n\nThe grandmother did not have to accept a child her daughter adopted as her own. If your daughter's decisions generally didn't/don't align with gmas values, it's not surprising that she didn't. Plus she did give her a shot at the trust, your daughter just opted out.", "So she knew the conditions of the will at some point in time before she got pregnant.  The girls were left equal amounts all they had to do was meet the conditions of the will.  How old was your daughter when she had the hysterectomy?  A classmate I went to school with, the 3 kids were left equal amounts of money but the condition was they couldn\u2019t have any tattoos."]}
