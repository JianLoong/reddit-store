You literally have no claim to it, or can make any decisions regarding it. It doesn\u2019t even come from your side of the family. \n\nStomp your feet all you want, it\u2019s Elise\u2019s choice what to do with it now. \n\nGrandmother didn\u2019t like the idea of teen mothers, and made sure that behaviour wasn\u2019t rewarded. Sucks, but that\u2019s how it is.\n\nEdit -spelling", "YTA, you have no right to question what other people do with their money and keep your nose out of other people's business.", "~~N A H. (except grandma, but she is dead)~~\n\nYTA\n\nYou are being a good father, wanting both children to have something.   Your wife is trying to play switzerland.\n\nHowever, it seems grandma had other ideas.\n\nThat said, I think you can have your opinions, but you should stay out.   You can advise Elise one time about it.  And say something like \"look, if you take all this money, legally you can do that, but you may be ruining your relationship with your sister\".    At that point though you need to let her make her choice.\n\nThis money was left to her, so it needs to be up to her what she does with it.   You can be disappointed in her choice.   But you still need to let it be her choice.  And frankly, I don't know that I'd call Elise and AH if she kept it all.\n\nMy grandmother had many grandchildren.  I got more in the will than others when she died.   Me and her were very close.  I don't think I was obligated to make it equal.\n\nEdit: Changed to YTA when it was revealed in the comments that they are step sisters, so Elise came into the family later.  That part makes a huge difference here.  You are essentially mad that \"your\" daughter isn't getting the same thing as your wife's daughter.  Yes, I understand you adopted Elise, and your wife adopted Rae, so they are both of your kids.   But being a blended family definitely is something that should be made clear.", "Yta. Grandmother went to give to Elise she can. The grandmother is no way obligated to give money to Rea. And neither is Elise.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your decision. It was your mother\u2019s.

Do you really need to perpetuate more bad feelings over the will by pitching fits over it?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your place to decide how someone else divides their estate. Your MIL had every right to place whatever wacky parameters she wanted on the trust. \n\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking that Elise had to undergo a hysterectomy at a young age\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean that the grandmother \u2018set up\u2019 Rea to fail. Rea made her own life choices.\n\nPushing for this is not going to \u2018bring the girls together\u2019, it\u2019s only going to increase the tension and create animosity. \n\nIf you are truly disturbed over the money, sit the girls down and discuss setting aside $15k from your own estate for Rea. It\u2019s the amount that she would have received from the trust, had she met the terms. Elise gets her $15k plus Rea\u2019s share now, and eventually gets $15k less during the division of your estate. \n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect solution, but it seems better than tearing your family apart by fighting the trust or badgering Elise to give her sister $15k.", "YTA. I get that you're unhappy, but this is not your choice to make nor your choice to impose. That's not how trusts and wills work. Talk to an attorney, but in all likelihood the only way for this to be lawfully distributed is in accordance with the conditions of the trust.", "YTA. This was your MIL will and she is the one that showed favoritism and both your children are old enough to understand this. However, this is her money and her will.

You pushing for something else might ruin the relationship of your daughters.", "YTA \n\nYou have absolutely no say in this inheritance. It wasn\u2019t your money and you have no right to say how it is divided up. \n\nYou also tried to sway opinion by leaving out that the girls are not biologically related and thus explains why there wasn\u2019t much of a relationship between your daughter and your mil.", "YTA you and Rae are Not entiteld to elises heritage\n\nMil did what she thought whats right and that's it", "Grandmother was not blood related to the daughter she did not leave money to (you should have included this relevant info in the original post) AND did not agree with her life choices.

Let the two sisters work their own relationship out going forward. Whatever went on that made their grandmother greatly favor one over the other, it's not something you can over ride.", "YTA. This is not your place. Fighting this will only lead to greater animosity between you all.", "YTA it's not your money or inheritance", "YTA - this was your grandmother's decision, not yours.", "YATA\n\nIt is not your money. Please honor her wishes and let it be distributed the way she wanted it to.\n\nAlso, she is also kind of an arsehole for setting it up that way, but that doesn't change the fact that it was her money and that is how she wanted it distributed. \n\nIf Elise decided to give something to Rea, then that is fine (the money is hers after she inherits it), but I don't think you should've even hinted it at.", "YTA, unless there's some sort of mental impairment or other legal way it can be contacted, the will is the will no matter how it sucks.\n\nMaybe she \"favoured\" as you put it Elise because they shared common interests, and why would she give tools etc to Rea of she's shown no interest in that kind of thing (which you don't explicitly say but I'm guessing that's the story).  \n\nElise can, unless there are stipulations in the trust as to what she can use the money for, do with it as she wishes. If she's wanting to split it then fair enough.  YTA for trying to pressure her into doing with it what you want her to", "Kinda YTA- You may be right. But you do not get to make the choices when it comes to someone else\u2019s will. Every single thing you said may be 100% true. But it\u2019s NOT your place legally or morally. Some people suck. My grandfather passed 2 houses down to my cousin. But he moved states and can\u2019t afford them neither can my father or uncle. But, my grandfather specifically told me that I don\u2019t get anything after he passes because I wasn\u2019t blood and I\u2019m a girl. So even though I could probably save those properties I won\u2019t. They aren\u2019t worth it and as I was reminded more than once, they\u2019re not for me. Is it shitty? Yea. Is it fair? No. But I did not make those choices and they were not mine to make in the first place.", "\u201cThere isnt much, about $30,000\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nYTA- If MIL and Elise had a better relationship and MIL wanted Elise to have the money then so be it.\nIts a legally binding will so you\u2019ll just have to swallow it.", "YTA\n\nYour MIL didn't even *meet* Rea for almost a decade. She was your daughter from a previous relationship that legally joined your MIL's family when she was 10. Are you really surprised that grandma had a stronger bond with the child she knew from birth that also shared the same interests as her? Curious how you left that part out.\n\nIf MIL really wanted Rea to have nothing, stipulating that she not have a child before she 21 seems like a pretty low bar to set. Regardless of whether or not it was a \"trap\", it's *her* will and *her* money. Elise has no moral obligation to share the inheritance she got from what sounds like a very influential, close loved one who passed away.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s not your money it\u2019s not your choice.

No one denies your mother-in-law's bias toward your youngest. Nevertheless, you have no legal claim to the inheritance and while you can offer your opinion, Elise is well within her rights to claim her inheritance in full and not share.", "YTA\n\n She can give her money to whoever she wants...", "YTA. While it may not be fair, it was your MIL money to leave to whomever she wished with whatever conditions she wished.", "YTA \n\nClearly grandma only saw the biological relative of hers as her grandaughter \n\nWhich yes sucks for your daughter but grandma doesn\u2019t have give your child anything in death and she clearly didn\u2019t do anything for her in life either \n\nWay to bury the lead with only one of the girls is actually related to grandma OP", "YTA You have no business overriding a dead woman's wishes.\n\nYou are about to split up your family over money that doesn't belong to you \n\nIt must be overwhelming to be so greedy", "Rea not having a hysterectomy is not the reason she didn\u2019t get the inheritance.

I spoke a lot about how unfair things were and not becoming like the MIL. OP, you completely buried the lede. Rea is not your MIL's granddaughter, and if I understand correctly you aren't Elise's father. You're completely the AH. Elise owes your daughter nothing, you don't get a say, your daughter doesn't deserve anything from your MIL.\n\nYTA. Elise is making something of herself and you raised a teen mom.

I\u2019d like to point out that said child was in existence when your MIL was alive (given the child is two, and your MIL passed away a year ago, and one presumes there was a nice solid 10mth pregnancy before that too). As such you MIL had a chance to change her will and didn\u2019t. So these are her last wishes.\n\nAll of this said\u2026 your MIL has made her path in life. But no one says you cannnot make your own stand with your own resources. If you feel that Rae deserves more for some reason, then you be the one to meet that need. FWIW\u2026 Rae will have children, and advantages from you for that, and Elise won\u2019t, and will have other advantages. You cannot split everything down the cent equally because clearly your two daughters are going to have very different lives. It sounds like one is having a family young and early, the other won\u2019t at all and instead is gardening and building a career.  \n\n\nEdit for Judgement: YTA. MIL made her mind up, you can\u2019t change that. You can change how you support your daughters going forward but you can\u2019t alter someone else\u2019s last will.", "YTA. MIL saw little of Rae and did not encourage her to make poor decisions. I am not sure how you think she set her up to fail.

Elise is her granddaughter with whom she has a close bond and shared interests. Rae is the child of her daughter's husband. You seem to have a misguided idea that you can force familial bonds. But your MIL does not owe your daughter an inheritance.", "YTA .. step \ud83d\udc80", "I guess opinions will differ on that one.\n\nI go with YTA. It is the will of the grandma. While she failed one of her grandkids in affection, it is still her will and her will alone. Also this will not retroactively \"fix\" the problems between rhea and her grandma, whats done is done and you all can just move forward becazse time doesnt flow back. You do you love both your children, that is enough. Also, it sounds like rhea and elise have no problems with each other and with gradma, it is more your problem because you feel it is unfair (which it kinda is, to be fair). If you keep insisting om elise splitting the inheritance, you might drive a wedge between the two over money (where there does not need to be one). \nAlso, it sounds like elise is sustaining a business? Doesnt she need the money more? \n\nNow, if rhea needs urgently money and this is the only pot available, i might change my judgement?\n\nThat grandma failed rhea is out of the question btw, that sucks of course.", "Glad I looked at comments before judging.\n\nYta, huge yta\n\nYour wife adopted Rea, her mother did not, her mother is under no obligation to leave her anything, but she still did anyway with the stipulation that neither get pregnant, so Rea knew she was out of the will. \n\nEven if she left her nothing though, it was mil's money,  and she can divide it however she wants, and she wanted to leave it to her granddaughter. Stop being an entitled leach.", "ESH except for Elise and Rea. Grandma seems a little harsh (can\u2019t inherit if you have a child before 21? WTF is that?) but Elise is under no obligation to give anything to Rea if she doesn\u2019t want to. Yes, it would be kind of her to do so, but it\u2019s not up to her.", "Do you know what Elise's intentions are after the fact? What is the relationship between the two? If this happened to me and my sister (in fact, something similar did happen sans kids of our own), we may not \"fight the will\" but we'd figure out a way to ensure the other had access to the money. Do you know if Elise has had such thoughts? And while, yes, it's OK for you to be angry regarding the principal of the matter (who wouldn't be?), you could be wasting anger or insulting Elise's integrity when she already has some sort of \"plan\" to do right by Rea and her kid.\n\nObviously, just speculation and projecting the relationship I have with *my* sister onto your daughters. I also don't Envy Elise for all of the inheritance tax she's going to end up paying between the property and money... yeesh.\n\nIt all sucks, so much. And I can't imagine the hurt Rea is feeling right now. I can totally see with the Y T A people are coming from and agree with a lot of their points. But for the sake of being protective of both kids and to see the best in Elise by \"expecting\" her to share (one of the basic teachings parents try to pass onto their kids), I can't help but think you're NTA for just being a parent who wants the best for both kids.\n\nKeep in mind, money can make people do... irrational things. Especially when you bring hostile anger into the matter. While defending Rea, you don't want to ostracize or ruin your relationship with Elise. This is easy come, easy go money. And regardless of the outcome, have faith in Rea to persevere, despite the blow this is. You NEED to go into this level-headed to prevent casualties.", "NTA. I think your expectation is fair. You probably can't force your daughter to share, though. Is there tension between her and her sister?", "Nta\n\nI can understand why you are peeved and would be the same. You cannot force your daughter to split the money, but you can choose to leave an unequal amount in your own will to make up for your MIL's pettiness.", "Going against the grain here with NTA. \n\nI disagree with the notions that because Rhea was adopted (still as a child!) she is worth less, that having had a child young makes her worth less, or that your MIL\u2019s legal right to do whatever she wants with her money absolves her of being an AH if she distributes it unevenly. \n\nI also don\u2019t think Elise is absolved if she takes the money and runs. If I got a family windfall of that sort I would feel like I wanted to share it more equally, because the situation would feel so unfair. Maybe not 50/50, because it\u2019s hard to let go of money once it\u2019s in your hand, but something. \n\nAll that being said, I do think you should stay out of it. Your children are adults. Your MIL was an adult. Your wife is an adult. You are verging on being TAH by trying to control their actions and adding strife over a relatively modest sum of money. I\u2019d advise you to let it go - if it works out such that it isn\u2019t fair, well, sometimes life just isn\u2019t fair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA.\n\nI'm seeing in the comments one is a step child and one isn't which is important information you failed to provide. To most people that doesn't or shouldn't matter. But for some people it does. Grandma could 100% have viewed the biological grandchild as hers.\n\nOne child was close to her, learned from her, was pretty much mentored by her, etc. Did the other ever try? If one was interested in grandma and what she had going on then it makes absolute sense why she was the favorite. Especially if they ended up having the same interest and career choices etc. Which could also mean grandma would have more reason to favorite that one when it came to land or money, setting her up after teaching her. At the end of the day grandma gave her attention and help to the one who wanted it and benefited from it.\n\nAs for the no child clause she didn't force the sister to have a kid. That was the sisters choice. Maybe she didn't like teen moms. Her choice to do so. Maybe if she knew one could have children and one couldn't she figured the childless one would be more career focused or something and wanted to make sure she was set up. There's different reasons for that clause. Might not agree with it regardless of the reason but that doesn't change that she likely had them.\n\nIf suddenly she decided she didn't want to be a sibling at such a young age it sounds like something happened. However even if it didn't I'd assume they were never close then and still are not. So why would she want to give anything given to her to her stepsister?\n\nWe don't know how the girls were treated at home., how they both acted with grandma, etc. There are so many details that could change everyone's opinion in either direction on this we just don't know. \n\n\nAt the end of it grandma might have been perfectly within reason to make the choices she did. We don't know enough details. It's also very likely she was an asshole who played favorites. However judging off the fact one child was interested in her and shared interests and was there from the beginning and biologically hers, one can see why she had a favorite.   \n\nRegardless though if grandma had reasons or was simply an asshole it was her land her money her whatever to do with what she wished. You can give an opinion to the child that got everything and you can be upset about it. But you can't force her to share especially if she is an adult. It is legally her money that her grandma wished her to have.\n\nAnd again just because one child could have children before 21 and one couldn't doesn't mean she set up anyone for failure. Nobody forced the one able to have children to have one. She made a choice and that choice came with consequences.\n\nIn my opinion grandma wasn't an asshole for favoring the child who actually spent time with her over shared interests etc. My grandma lived near her mother for like 2 decades at the end. Her brother did not. Grandma was there multiple times a week running errands, spending time, etc. Brother was not. Because i was raised by my grandma I was also there. His kids were not. If great grandma wanted to see them she had to always travel to them in a completely different state. When great grandma was on her dying bed, grandma was there and her brother was not. I was there, his kids were not. Grandma and I cleaned out her house, saw to her funeral, took care of everything. He and his kids did not.

When we sold my grandfather's house to get him into a nursing home (you have to qualify for Medicaid at that point), the only way we could preserve anything was by creating a special needs trust. I have a cousin who is special needs so she now has $240,000 that she didn't need (her family is very comfortable). But we're all okay with her getting the money. I actually qualify for a special needs trust and I think my parents now have one for me, but my cousin's needs are more severe so I think at the time we thought only she needed it. Knowing now I could have had half that money maybe doesn't bother me. I'm very fortunate and have supportive parents. My cousin's needs don't require any expenses, but it's nice that down the line they might be able to do things like hiring her a private aide, especially after her parents are gone. \n\nAnyway, my point is Elise may simply have shown a lot more interest in her grandmother, whereas Rea may never have visited or really clicked with her.

This isn\u2019t always possible, but I suspect that in this matter with this little money involved ($30K is low for these types of situations), no government agency will get involved and it\u2019s only the parties to the trust that will care.\n\nIf the trustee isn\u2019t a parent or close relative (like a lawyer or a bank), they\u2019re unlikely to violate the terms of the trust.", "Bs who has a hysterectomy at 10?", "It's an added layer of protection should anyone want to challenge her last wishes. An extra clause to make sure. She knew her son-in-law was greedy.", "My father always told me how is own mother spent a huge amount of  her energy talking about how much money she would get when her parents died.  That was all she ever cared about and was just waiting for the day!\n\nThen she died before them.", "When my parents passed, there wasn\u2019t much beyond a house that my mom left to my sister. Sister was only one without a house. My brother and I both thought that this was the best decision. Security for our sister. Just as an aside, neither my brother nor I have a good relationship with my sister, but we were both happy she gained some security with this. \n\nOn the other hand, I am still very close with my ex MIL. I told her that she should spend every last penny of her money. If she leaves a dime, her three children will spend the rest of their lives fighting over the spare penny. \n\nAll of them were pissed when she moved into a wonderful senior living place, because she was spending their inheritance. My girls and I were so happy for her. She had security, friends, community. There is a bar in this place along with a salon, and movie theatre. We wanted to be able to live there too! Ha. \n\nI really don\u2019t like my ex MIL\u2019s kids. Shameful behaviour and greed.", "Fellow black sheep - except it was my father who gave everything to my sister (including the house that I was living in and paying rent for 10+ years) despite a promise that he would leave it to both of us. She doubled my rent and threatens to kick me out if I complain. I hope someday I have the peace that you do about it. \n\nI have a feeling that for OP it is not the $$ but rather the obvious \"slap from the grave\" by grandma. If it was just a step situation, that would be one thing... but it is her daughters CHILD. It makes me sad that grandma had that much hate in her heart. All OP & wife can do is \"make up for it\" with his final wishes.", "OP verifiably leaves out key details. I think what we are seeing is the tip of the AH iceberg, metaphorically speaking.", "This here, 100%", "I am not sure that's why. I for one would be very concerned about them needing eldery care and there being no money for them to be comfortable, even certain surgeries are almost impossible to get in the public hospital where I am from. I look at the situation with my grandmother and it is already so difficult and that's with her having *some* money for care and children that care and are able bodied. I am an only child to my mom, I have a  rather from my dad but he lives away and I am disabled myself. I do worry with how little my own parents save but it's not because I want their money. I don't even want to think about being in a position where I would inherit anything because of what that means.", "Karma is a sly bitch, but oh boy is she funny.", "It could even be argued that since this was so long ago it could have potentially been pre hysterectomy and grandma was just thinking they should be older before starting a family. If this is the case when it was written it is possible bio granddaughter could have failed too.", "Exactly. He and Rhea can definitely be upset but they have no right to pressure Elise to split the small inheritance she was given.", "Your stepson also has his own set of legit grandparents to inherit from. We went through this with my step brother and sister who were upset that they didn't get an inheritance from their step grandparents, in addition to the inheritance they received from their legit grandparents. Crazy how entitled and biased people can be.", "Well...Rea didn't know about the clause in the trust until after \"non-blood relative Grandma\" died. Perhaps she would have made different choices. Perhaps not. But Grandma made an AH manipulative move from the grave. So yeah, it's a slap in the face.", "Son is two. Grandma died a year ago. She specifically worded that to exclude Rea without saying it because the baby was already around before she died", "Have fun ruining the relationship of your grandchildren. You\u2019re not being kind in that situation, you\u2019re forcing your grandchild into a position that they probably don\u2019t want to be in.", "Eh I think that's a bit cheeky. I would be pretty devastated if my parents were incredibly unfairly favorable to my biological child over an adopted or step child. There's favoring. Then there's out right ignoring one.", "Its also not like she knew about the clause. (atleast from how I read the order of events)", "Exactly. Even if Rea wasn't pregnant already when she set up the will/trust she had the ability to change it or just not put it in to begin with", "I think that depends a little on how old the girls were when the parents got married. We\u2019re they already in their teens, so  Gma already knows one kid so much better by the age where they are learning professions? Is the extra time just because one was interested in what gma does and chose to spend time with her learning (greenhouses are relevant, so I assume horticultural something which a lot of people think of as boring old lady stuff). \n\nDoes the step gchild still have gparents around through her bio dad that she is close to? That is usually a big factor", "I'm not surprised that OP is estranged from the rest of his family seeing as he's a gigantic asshole.", "Love it! \n\nWe have similar jokes, but if we annoy the parents, we are warned that all money will be donated to the kitty litter charity. (They hate cats).", "Trusts can absolutely be contested. The difference (at least in my state) is that probate notices are sent to heirs at law, where trust notices are only sent to actual named beneficiaries. But that doesn't mean someone couldn't contest a trust if they believed it was the result of undue influence or that the settlor lacked capacity.", "*Revocable living* trust.", "I *finally* managed to convince my (F30s, no kids) mom (60s)not to get life insurance. Im grown, married, no dependents and my house is paid off, I do not need to *profit from your death mom*. I told her to put some of what she would have paid into premiums into a savings account for funeral expenses if she felt that was necessary, but god, what a waste of money insurance would be.", "I met a couple the other day in their gray years off hiking the Pacific Crest trail from Canada to mexico.", "*Irrevocable* works, too, but it depends on how much you want to mess about with what you have vs how much you'd like to avoid estate tax, creditors, etc. Personal choice depending on circumstances.", "This is another saddening story from a war that was completely avoidable, amid countless billions of sad stories that came from that war alone. And the sad stories are people, and they could have been happy stories", "I want to add that a life insurance policy or just plain savings is better than pre-paying for your funeral (unless you KNOW you\u2019re gonna die v soon) because if anything happens to the funeral home you pre-paid at you\u2019ll usually be out of luck.", "Rest assured that wills and inheritances will destroy almost every family. My will is written so that every member of my family is named and gets something. Exactly one dollar. The bulk of our estate will be left to my in law kids who I view as family. My blood family, I am sure, will fight and contest it but as my lawyer says, by naming them , it shows that any potential illness or age did not make me forget my sisters, brother nephews or nieces. I did in fact remember them. I also took the steps for a mental evaluation just to be sure they get nothing. I only wish they would need to go to his office to get their \"winnings\" (as they called it when my father died) only to find a check for $1.00. I frankly would rather see everything burned or given to the state before I see my family with it. I do have a trust set for my dog which will provide some income for the person who cares for him if my wife and I are gone and he lives. That portion of the money goes to to the caretaker as long as he lives his natural life and provided he does not eat my face if he should find me first. Otherwise that money goes to the kids I like.", "That's another reason to not underestimate the power of the \"fuck you\" dollar. It is critical, to avoid probate court, to will any person you want to disinherit a \"fuck you\" dollar. It clearly indicates that the person in question was NOT forgotten but shunned."]}
