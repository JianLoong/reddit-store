I gave birth to our second son early in June. I didn't inform my parents or my siblings about his birth until yesterday. \n\nOur second son was born preterm at 31 weeks gestation, following in the footsteps of our older son who was also born prematurely at 29 weeks. Both of them spent over a month in the NICU. Long story short, I wouldn't wish a NICU stay on my worst enemy. I'm just lucky my amazing husband was my rock and provided unwavering support both times. \n\nBefore I get into why I waited so long to tell my parents and siblings about the birth of number two, I'll share some context. I told my parents and siblings I was pregnant when I was barely 6 weeks along. Initially, I had planned to wait until at least 12 weeks but my mom had mentioned her intention to book international flights to visit Italy in June/ July, which coincided with my due date. Concerned about not being refunded for canceled flights, I disclosed the pregnancy earlier than intended. My family expressed their excitement, and they postponed their trip, saying they would plan for it the next year.\n\nFast forward to 8 months into my pregnancy, my mom informed me that she had booked a flight for her and my dad. They were scheduled to leave on June 6th and return on July 12th. That meant their return was two days AFTER my due date, and the risk of preterm labor was looming over me.\n\nLo and behold, my son arrived on June 4th, two days before their departure. Overwhelmed with emotions, knowing that another NICU stay was inevitable, I faced a difficult decision. Should I call and potentially dampen their excitement for their trip or stay silent and allow them to enjoy their vacation? I chose the latter, wishing them safe travels and engaging in their vacation updates and photos over the next month.\n\nIt wasn't until my son was finally discharged from the NICU and in a healthy state that I shared the news with my family. They were eager to meet him, but considering their recent international travel and the potential health risks, I decided to impose a two-week waiting period before we could get together. They did not take that imposition well. But, it turns out they have COVID. So who knows when we'll get together.\n\nDuring this period, it would've been nice to have more support but my family wasn't able to provide it. My relationship with my mother has always been challenging, and this particular incident strained our emotional connection even further. \n\nSo AITA for not calling and telling them sooner?", "created_utc": 1689668309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152sd57/aita_for_keeping_the_birth_of_my_son_a_secret_for/", "score": 171, "replies": ["NTA\n\nYou chose your parents\u2019 vacation over your familial support. I think that was a nice, thoughtful gesture, even at the expense of not having them around at the start of your bebe\u2019s life.", "NTA for taking sensible precautions around COVID and international travellers around newborns. They should not have pushed back on that.\n\nRe: not telling them before they left, it feels like a N A H. I actually had a really similar situation once where I was not informed about a family member's sudden health event as I was on my honeymoon and they didn't want to spoil it. I understood the call, though privately felt I'd have rathered been told - not that there was anything I could really do about it. Maybe in hindsight it was the right thing after all.", "NTA\n\nNothing wrong with waiting to ensure your son was healthy enough leave the ICU to tell others.", "NTA. While I get that they are hurt, they took the risk of planning a trip on your due date. Hope your son is doing better!", "NTA. Especially with imposing restrictions on a preterm baby, his immune is weaker than normal.", "NTA. You don't owe them the knowledge. This is your birth and your child. And it's a good thing you chose to be safe when they ended up sick. Hope everyone is healthy soon.", "They knew your history of pre term birth and still scheduled a trip near your due date. They only have themselves to blame for this. NTA", "Without reading the context, NTA, it\u2019s up to you only when you reveal, and as long as you and your partner are on the same page about it then you\u2019ve done nothing wrong! Add a NICU (and a second one at that) stay to it all, totally understand why you waited. Sending love \ud83d\udc95\n\nETA: After reading the context, you did such a selfless thing by not sharing, and it\u2019s on them for booking a holiday when they knew roughly when you would be having your baby. I also think the 2 week wait after international travel is fair, and was definitely for the best with them being sick!! They can be hurt all they want, but your responsibility is to the wellbeing of your child, not them and their feelings. They\u2019ll get past it, and not meeting the baby immediately won\u2019t hurt them, they have that child\u2019s whole life to be there!", "NTA \nSo your mother booked a holiday so that she would be gone for your due date,  and knows you already had a premie,  and she's complaining about you keeping the birth from her so she could enjoy her deliberately planned holiday? Does she do this kind of stuff often because it might be time to start keeping more stuff from her. It seems to me that she obviously booked this holiday so she could make a big fuss of being called back to welcome new baby. Time to reconsider her involvement in your life.", "NTA. You already had the experience with baby no 1 and your parents surely would have been worried their whole vacation about you and the baby. This was surely as stressful time for you and not discussing that with anyone was surely hard, but at the same time you had some time for yourselves to grown into a 2time mom and you have given the kid the time of rest it needed. I hope you are all well now and I wish you all the best.", "NTA\n\nYou chose peace and the safety of your family. Congrats on the baby and keeping son healthy", "NTA\nIt's your baby and as a mother you do everything you can to keep him safe. They returned from Italy having COVID so it was a good decision not to let them see the baby. They should understand you and that you just wanted to protect your baby.", "NTA, your immediate family comes first. Sometimes that includes parents but not in this case. I wouldn\u2019t want someone who just returned from overseas to be near a newborn. They should have postponed it like they said they would if they wanted to be part of it.", "NTA, since letting them know sooner wouldn't have allowed them to meet your baby any earlier, and they deliberately booked the trip to arrive back after your due date. But you probably should have let them know in advance that when they return from the trip you would ask them to quarantine for two weeks (Although I think that's just common sense). However, they shouldn't be upset about that since they would have put the baby's health at risk.", "I know I will get hit for this, but NAH. OP, you are absolutely entitled to feel this way, but keep in mind that the opposite of this sucks. My grandfather got diagnosed with alzheimer's not long after I moved close to them. They decided not to say anything until it was too late (he crashed within a year) and he was quite far gone, and I to this day regret not spending more time with him rather than taking the extra overtime. \n\nIf God forbid anything happened to your baby while they were away, I don't know if I would be able to look past that slight so easily if I had been them. Just a thought.", "Voting sake: NTA \n\n\nMore complicatedly\u2026 My daughter is 25. MAAAAYYYYYBE a little tiny bit of AH. But it\u2019s not your fault. You were working with what you had.  Is it AH to be stuck between a rock and hard place? Because that\u2019s what happened. \n\nComing from the place of your mom, it would upset me. \n\nBut also my husband wouldn\u2019t be able to prod me out of my daughter\u2019s zip code with a stick if she had a premature NICU birth experience the last time. And nor would he try. \n\nOP: we\u2019d be camped out in your living room (metaphorically speaking) if all indication was that this was going to be high risk again. So this rests on your parents. What you did was very considerate since she had all of the current information when she made the plans. \n \nShe needs to give a mea culpa, and acknowledge her place in this. Even if she\u2019s upset with you, her decision is the root cause. It doesn\u2019t matter how she feels. Or what she thinks you did wrong. She needs to accept her part of the blame before trying to discuss how she feels in this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But that's the choice she made, I respected it but it did make me more emotionally distant from her. Now it seems she feels guilty and wants to blame me.", "You were not TA.  It's all very well for your mother to say, after the fact, that she would have cancelled her trip.  She booked it \\*when you were due to have a baby\\*.  She knew this.\n\nI think it was kind of you to keep quiet and let them have their expensive trip to enjoy.  I think it was absolutely the right call to make CERTAIN they were healthy before they could visit your child.

Or whatever other passive aggressive crap that seems incredibly likely given her response to you. \n\nI would absolutely have interpreted your mom\u2019s actions of vacation planning/timing as evidence of understanding that a quarantine period to ensure an infant (especially a pre-term infant) is not exposed to viruses is an unbreakable requirement. \n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. Your mom is feeling guilty because she has her priorities out of whack and is deflecting her guilt on you. \n\nI would be really pissed off if she pulled that crap with me. You\u2019ve already been extremely accommodating with their choices. Now they need to live with the consequences of those choices without deflecting blame onto you.", ">They called it my \"mothers intuition\" when they tested positive. I called it common sense lol.\n\nI've got about a half-dozen different acquaintances who have travelled recently, both within the States and to places outside, and *each of them* has come down with COVID on the plane out or the plane back. One of them had to leave a cruise right after she got there. I genuinely don't understand why anyone thinks it's okay to travel yet.", "Why?", "Because she took the choice away from them on whether or not to still go on their trip. \nAlso it\u2019s just not a nice thing to do", "They took the risk of planning it around the OP\u2019s due date. OP is NTA here", "Thanks for answering my question. I think it is more helpful for people when you explain why you think they are right or wrong. Otherwise it feels like thoughtless name calling rather than sharing differing perspectives.", "No she isn\u2019t", "She showed her priorities by booking 2 days after your due date. NTA", "NTA my issue, mainly stems from them planning and booking a vacation during the period of your due date, as they wanted to be there. They are adults able to do whatever they want but knowing the history of pre-mature birth and unplanned birth, that can happen literally at any time why would they plan a holiday around those days.\n\nYou chose to sacrifice family support in favor of them having a good vacation, which, in my opinion was very thoughtful. \n\nYou have every right to protect your baby right now. Especially from people who just went on an international trip. At the end of the day whether the baby was in the NICU or not they still would need to wait a couple days before seeing the baby, and you Covid is very much present, and affecting people.

Odd.\n\nAfter that what you do is your business.\n\nNTA", "You hit the nail on the head. My mom does this stuff often. Growing up, she told us many times she wishes she never had kids. She was emotionally and physically abusive but now as adults pretends none of that ever happened. As adults, she tries to veil that part of her but she hasn't changed.
