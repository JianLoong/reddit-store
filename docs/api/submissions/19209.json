Not surprising, based on what your mother has said about his lack of assistance with YOU. He is merely proving your mother right.\n\nCut him off. it sounds like he only is trying to keep contact with you to serve his own needs.

The only thing you have in common is shared genetics. She has her mother and possibly her mothers family who have got a relationship with her.\n\nIt takes more than genetics to be a dad - your real dad is the one who raised you, was there when you had your triumphs and there when you had your lows.  who praised you when you achieved something and scolded you when you acted a jerk.\n\nYou know who your dad is, the other guy is just a sperm doner.\n\nIf he isn't listening to you and respecting you trying to pressure and bully you into doing what he wants, you can break contact with him.", "NTA. A relationship should not all be about what you can do for your father. It sounds like he sees you only as someone he can use, not as a person in your own right.

After all, your mother raised you without him. \n\nSecond, you don't owe your father a relationship.

I\u2019m not comfortable with the fact that a lot of the time we talk you like to bring up past history with my mother to make me feel guilt trip me instead of treating me like an adult. I don\u2019t owe you a relationship with you because that is for me to decide because I already reached adulthood and the raising is done and it\u2019s too late now. You clearly don\u2019t respect me enough to listen to me or the rest of my family members that live with me at home. I already tried this relationship thing and the only thing you want to do is take your anger out on me and treat me like a child . That includes talking about what my mother did. It\u2019s getting really weird. The last straw was when you threatened me with consequences. I\u2019m not sure what ? Before you say anything about my mom and stepdad influencing me it has nothing to do with them since this based on our interactions. You consistently talk about them while they never talk about you.  Also I am unable to act as a guardian as you die as taking care of a child is not a walk in a park because all of the mother and father duties will fall on me. That is unfair. Her mother should still be alive to take care of her and I might help the best I can. That\u2019s your responsibility. The point is that you clearly do not care about my feelings and you only want a \u201crelationship\u201d with me just to take your anger off of me over stuff that happened 20 years ago.

You will be best served by squashing that wiggle room. \"I'm not really interested in talking\", for example, leaves wiggle room because it implies you don't feel it strongly. \"I'm not interested in talking\" is a much tighter thing to say, and leaves less wiggle room that you might change your mind. \n\nAlso, I'd add an instruction at the end (assuming you really feel this) making the next steps very explicit.

Your aunt needs to mind her own business, and imo you need to block your dad. He isn't going to become a reasonable person, and dealing with this is harmful to you. If your aunt wants to talk to him she can go ahead, but if she bugs YOU to i think it'd fine if you blocked her, too, at least temporarily. If your half sister becomes an orphan or moves to the states you can reevaluate then, but there's NO reason to be having this conversation now except possibly your dad wanting to exert some petty control over you. The same controlling \"\"\"consequences\"\"\" hes threatening if you don't call him dad. \n\nIs he adding anything positive to your life? Not the sense that you \"should\" have him in your life, not the absence of your aunt bugging you, something concrete and good that he actively adds to your life.

Just tell him you\u2019re done in as few words as possible and then block him. \n\n I know you want to make him understand how you feel, but he shows absolutely no signs of being willing or able to empathize with you.
