I don't/can't work due to health/chronic pain issues. My husband works full time usually 35-40 hours a week.\n\nWhen I cook dinner, I make enough so my husband has leftovers to take to work the next day. He has the habit of eating what's supposed to be his lunch as a large night time snack before bed. We have plenty of stuff he can snack on or heat up that's not his lunch for the next day. Then he ends up eating out instead and he hates fast food so he spends $20-$25 on lunch each day he eats his lunch as a snack. This adds up and makes money tighter for us. I get its his income but it's affecting the entire family. I've asked him to not eat his lunch as a snack but he says he loves my cooking and can't help it and I should feel complimented he enjoys it so much. I do appreciate he likes what I cook so much, but I also like knowing our bills will all be paid and we can afford gas, groceries, household supplies, and stuff for the kids without being in the red each week. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: if I make more for dinner he will have 3rd/4th helpings. I do the grocery shopping and try to get everything I can on his snack list, he will still eat his lunch as a snack. Hubby is a recovering gambling addict and currently owes $100k in back taxes that I'm trying to also budget to pay towards each month. He currently works in retail making around $40k a year. He has a masters in economics and used to make $200k+ but some bad decisions in life messed that up and he ended up in legal trouble and can no longer work in his former industry.", "created_utc": 1695939393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16utj95/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_not_eat_lunch_at/", "score": 2018, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe that will help him see the impact of what he\u2019s doing", "NTA.\n\nQuite honestly OP, I am pretty well paid, I don't often want for much, and I am starting to take leftovers for lunch these days, a major change for me.\n\nI have been eating the same few menu choices from around maybe 6 or 8 restaurants in my area for 15 years now, and in the past 3 years, the cost of my meals has risen about 35%. It has gone from under 10 most times, to 13 or 14 depending on the meal choice. That is a massive difference in money spent over a year.\n\nConsider the math: A person works maybe 48 to 50 weeks a year. Let's say 50 for easy math, and besides, let's be real, you might get a meal on a weekend now and then as well. That means 250 working days. 4 to 5 dollars more a meal, that's an extra 1250 dollars a year. The cost at under 10 a meal was still about 2500 a year, now it's 3750 or so. \n\nFor me, frankly, I can afford it, but it galls me how quickly it has gone up, and I'm kind of annoyed. The cost of everything is out of hand as it is, now my lunch is costing me 1250 dollars more? Fuck that I'm out. Time to eat leftovers. My wife's a great cook anyway, I'm just snooty and don't like reheated food.

Every penny needs rn be accounted for. So he can eat leftovers for lunch or he can buy whatever he can get for a budgeted lunch\u2026.that\u2019s probably not going to be $25 per day. \n\nThe other trick you could try is put any extra food immediately in Tupperware and stick it in the freezer. It won\u2019t be obvious or easy to eat but he can microwave it at work the next day.", "NTA. He\u2019s not the AH for eating leftovers, but he is for ordering $25 worth of takeout!

Perhaps some professional help might be needed.", "I don't think you husband has an impulse control problem, but a responsibility problem.   It is not HIS money, it's your familiy's money.  Others have done the math for you.  He is just selfish--don't let him flatter you into thinking it's a you problem.  He's a jerk.", "NTA.

It takes quite awhile to get approved. You can also tell your husband that you can handle finances as you are not working. That would put you in control of how much spending money he has. Talk to him and listen to him, he may not want taking something to work that he has to warm up. Everytime I am tempted to spend money on something frivolous, I hesitate and think about what else I could spend that money on.

It sounds as though he's overeating to replace a gambling addiction. Are you sure he's spending $20-25 on lunch?", "Jesus lol", "NTA\n\nYou're in an extremely unstable place financially. For a family of 4, your income is too low. It's nearly a mathematical impossibility to house, feed, and clothe all of you - plus transportation to & from work, electricity, medical care - adding loan payments for the $100K on top of all that - and your husband is spending the annual equivalent of half of a month's take-home pay on dining out. \n\nI'm guessing that he's feeling sorry for himself secretly and the predicament he got himself into. His meals at lunch are about him pretending he still has his old life. Microwaving leftovers probably makes him feel ashamed - and shame is always a roadblock for the recovery of an addict. But he dug a very deep hole and dragged all of you into it, so he needs to get with the program. If you intend to stay married, you need a partner who can commit to being a part of the solution instead of continuing the self-indulgence. \n\nYou can't thrift shop your way out of this. It's time to lay the budget out on the kitchen table and comb through it together. I suspect that's never really happened. He's letting you do all the financial work and nag him about spending so he can justify his defiant bad little boy behavior.", "NTA At this point, if you ever want to be out of debt, you need to do three things. Take away his access to money. He should have zero dollars and zero cents on him at all times. You are the money keeper. Then, either you need to get a job or husband needs to get a second/better job. The interest alone you will literally never get out of that debt. Then see if you can get some help with a loan consolidation or filing bankruptcy. Idk. You need the help of a professional. If husband refuses to do these 3 things then YOU NEED TO LEAVE. Also, unless you are seeing the receipts or leftovers, baby, he is using that money on his addictions. That is why he eats ALL the leftovers no matter how much you make. So he has an excuse to spend 20-25 bucks a day on his addictions. Even if he pays for it on credit card he could be wily enough to be buying lunch for one or two other people, going and picking it up, then they give him cash.", "Is there not a way you can take up a job working remotely even part time?\n\nCaring for a baby under a year old takes a lot of energy, how are you doing this with chronic health issues?

Have you always been unable to work or is this a recent development?\n\nI\u2019m taking no sides here as there isn\u2019t enough info to go on, but unless OP is very seriously ill, I take on board that her husband is working a full week so feels entitled to eat lunch out, selfish as it may seem of him.", "It sounds like he is very hungry. Does he have a job that burns calories during the day?", "NAH. \n\nFirst, it's not \"his money\" you guys are married, so it's \"both of your money.\" \n\nSecond, I don't know if your husband is working physical labor or why he's so hungry, but it's good he's eating real food late at night instead of snacks. It's much healthier for him to eat more of dinner, then filling up on chips or whatever. So, the solution isn't to get him to eat less. \n\nBut third, it's very reasonable to have a budget. And that should be your focus. Not on getting him to not eat leftovers at night. But, you two, as a couple, should come up with a budget that works for both of you. His lunches should be part of that budget. But don't only focus on the lunches, set up a budget that says how much you spend on everything- rent/mortgage, car, savings, groceries, date night, kid's expenses, etc. Part of the budget is his lunch budget. Since he's an adult, he can manage that lunch budget how he wants. \n\nMaybe he'll ask you to make an even larger dinner, so he has left overs. Maybe he'll do Sunday meal prep. Maybe he'll do my favorite, which is go to a grocery store on Monday over my lunch break, buy a rotisserie chicken, microwaveable rice and steamer veggie bags, and then eat that for a couple days. But it doesn't matter. He'll have a lunch budget, and he can spend it how he likes. \n\nAnd make sure the budget is fair, and both you and him are making sacrifices. And if his going out to eat for lunch is really important to him, show him numbers and ask (don't accuse) him where he thinks the money should shift from. Work until it adds up. \n\nThen, if he doesn't stick to the budget, then yeah, he's being an AH (and vice versa, you have to stick to yours), but this allows you to have what you want (less money being spent) while allowing each adult to act like adults.", "NTA.

That\u2019s just selfish and shortsighted on husbands part.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned it, having a chronic illness does not prevent you from getting part-time work.
