I don't/can't work due to health/chronic pain issues. My husband works full time usually 35-40 hours a week.\n\nWhen I cook dinner, I make enough so my husband has leftovers to take to work the next day. He has the habit of eating what's supposed to be his lunch as a large night time snack before bed. We have plenty of stuff he can snack on or heat up that's not his lunch for the next day. Then he ends up eating out instead and he hates fast food so he spends $20-$25 on lunch each day he eats his lunch as a snack. This adds up and makes money tighter for us. I get its his income but it's affecting the entire family. I've asked him to not eat his lunch as a snack but he says he loves my cooking and can't help it and I should feel complimented he enjoys it so much. I do appreciate he likes what I cook so much, but I also like knowing our bills will all be paid and we can afford gas, groceries, household supplies, and stuff for the kids without being in the red each week. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: if I make more for dinner he will have 3rd/4th helpings. I do the grocery shopping and try to get everything I can on his snack list, he will still eat his lunch as a snack. Hubby is a recovering gambling addict and currently owes $100k in back taxes that I'm trying to also budget to pay towards each month. He currently works in retail making around $40k a year. He has a masters in economics and used to make $200k+ but some bad decisions in life messed that up and he ended up in legal trouble and can no longer work in his former industry.", "created_utc": 1695939393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16utj95/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_not_eat_lunch_at/", "score": 5515, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe that will help him see the impact of what he\u2019s doing", "NTA.\n\nQuite honestly OP, I am pretty well paid, I don't often want for much, and I am starting to take leftovers for lunch these days, a major change for me.\n\nI have been eating the same few menu choices from around maybe 6 or 8 restaurants in my area for 15 years now, and in the past 3 years, the cost of my meals has risen about 35%. It has gone from under 10 most times, to 13 or 14 depending on the meal choice. That is a massive difference in money spent over a year.\n\nConsider the math: A person works maybe 48 to 50 weeks a year. Let's say 50 for easy math, and besides, let's be real, you might get a meal on a weekend now and then as well. That means 250 working days. 4 to 5 dollars more a meal, that's an extra 1250 dollars a year. The cost at under 10 a meal was still about 2500 a year, now it's 3750 or so. \n\nFor me, frankly, I can afford it, but it galls me how quickly it has gone up, and I'm kind of annoyed. The cost of everything is out of hand as it is, now my lunch is costing me 1250 dollars more? Fuck that I'm out. Time to eat leftovers. My wife's a great cook anyway, I'm just snooty and don't like reheated food.

Every penny needs rn be accounted for. So he can eat leftovers for lunch or he can buy whatever he can get for a budgeted lunch\u2026.that\u2019s probably not going to be $25 per day. \n\nThe other trick you could try is put any extra food immediately in Tupperware and stick it in the freezer. It won\u2019t be obvious or easy to eat but he can microwave it at work the next day.", "NTA. He\u2019s not the AH for eating leftovers, but he is for ordering $25 worth of takeout!

Perhaps some professional help might be needed.", "I don't think you husband has an impulse control problem, but a responsibility problem.   It is not HIS money, it's your familiy's money.  Others have done the math for you.  He is just selfish--don't let him flatter you into thinking it's a you problem.  He's a jerk.", "NTA.

It takes quite awhile to get approved. You can also tell your husband that you can handle finances as you are not working. That would put you in control of how much spending money he has. Talk to him and listen to him, he may not want taking something to work that he has to warm up. Everytime I am tempted to spend money on something frivolous, I hesitate and think about what else I could spend that money on.

It sounds as though he's overeating to replace a gambling addiction. Are you sure he's spending $20-25 on lunch?", "Jesus lol", "NTA\n\nYou're in an extremely unstable place financially. For a family of 4, your income is too low. It's nearly a mathematical impossibility to house, feed, and clothe all of you - plus transportation to & from work, electricity, medical care - adding loan payments for the $100K on top of all that - and your husband is spending the annual equivalent of half of a month's take-home pay on dining out. \n\nI'm guessing that he's feeling sorry for himself secretly and the predicament he got himself into. His meals at lunch are about him pretending he still has his old life. Microwaving leftovers probably makes him feel ashamed - and shame is always a roadblock for the recovery of an addict. But he dug a very deep hole and dragged all of you into it, so he needs to get with the program. If you intend to stay married, you need a partner who can commit to being a part of the solution instead of continuing the self-indulgence. \n\nYou can't thrift shop your way out of this. It's time to lay the budget out on the kitchen table and comb through it together. I suspect that's never really happened. He's letting you do all the financial work and nag him about spending so he can justify his defiant bad little boy behavior.", "NTA At this point, if you ever want to be out of debt, you need to do three things. Take away his access to money. He should have zero dollars and zero cents on him at all times. You are the money keeper. Then, either you need to get a job or husband needs to get a second/better job. The interest alone you will literally never get out of that debt. Then see if you can get some help with a loan consolidation or filing bankruptcy. Idk. You need the help of a professional. If husband refuses to do these 3 things then YOU NEED TO LEAVE. Also, unless you are seeing the receipts or leftovers, baby, he is using that money on his addictions. That is why he eats ALL the leftovers no matter how much you make. So he has an excuse to spend 20-25 bucks a day on his addictions. Even if he pays for it on credit card he could be wily enough to be buying lunch for one or two other people, going and picking it up, then they give him cash.", "Is there not a way you can take up a job working remotely even part time?\n\nCaring for a baby under a year old takes a lot of energy, how are you doing this with chronic health issues? A part time office job would almost be physically easier than this.\n\nAre you getting treatment for your health issues so you can manage your situation? Have you always been unable to work or is this a recent development?\n\nI\u2019m taking no sides here as there isn\u2019t enough info to go on, but unless OP is very seriously ill, I take on board that her husband is working a full week so feels entitled to eat lunch out, selfish as it may seem of him.", "It sounds like he is very hungry. Does he have a job that burns calories during the day?", "NAH. \n\nFirst, it's not \"his money\" you guys are married, so it's \"both of your money.\" \n\nSecond, I don't know if your husband is working physical labor or why he's so hungry, but it's good he's eating real food late at night instead of snacks. It's much healthier for him to eat more of dinner, then filling up on chips or whatever. So, the solution isn't to get him to eat less. \n\nBut third, it's very reasonable to have a budget. And that should be your focus. Not on getting him to not eat leftovers at night. But, you two, as a couple, should come up with a budget that works for both of you. His lunches should be part of that budget. But don't only focus on the lunches, set up a budget that says how much you spend on everything- rent/mortgage, car, savings, groceries, date night, kid's expenses, etc. Part of the budget is his lunch budget. Since he's an adult, he can manage that lunch budget how he wants. \n\nMaybe he'll ask you to make an even larger dinner, so he has left overs. Maybe he'll do Sunday meal prep. Maybe he'll do my favorite, which is go to a grocery store on Monday over my lunch break, buy a rotisserie chicken, microwaveable rice and steamer veggie bags, and then eat that for a couple days. But it doesn't matter. He'll have a lunch budget, and he can spend it how he likes. \n\nAnd make sure the budget is fair, and both you and him are making sacrifices. And if his going out to eat for lunch is really important to him, show him numbers and ask (don't accuse) him where he thinks the money should shift from. Work until it adds up. \n\nThen, if he doesn't stick to the budget, then yeah, he's being an AH (and vice versa, you have to stick to yours), but this allows you to have what you want (less money being spent) while allowing each adult to act like adults.", "NTA.

That\u2019s just selfish and shortsighted on husbands part.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned it, having a chronic illness does not prevent you from getting part-time work.

Honestly, she may want to cut and run. He isnt an earner and he is an addict.", "Make him take a pb&j sandwich every time he eats the leftovers.  Maybe that will encourage him to save the good food for the next day.", "Just heard this in hasanabi's voice", "I completely agree. Like I said, HE is the problem. But until she gets that problem resolved--however she decides to do that--this would be a stopgap to the problem of the pricy lunches.", "\nMy son's paternal grandparents had a similar setup for a long time. He had a gambling addiction and blew all their money. So her ultimatum was she got 100% control of their finances or she would get a divorce. He opted for her to have full control of all the money. He wasn't allowed a checkbook, a debit card, or any credit cards. If he needed to buy something he had to ask his wife. If she agreed, he would get a payment method and would have to give it back after the purchase along with the receipt.", "This is what you do with a child who doesn't understand spending. To have to do this with a grown man is just sad, I see why he's your ex lol. I hope you are happy and in a better position!!\n\nEdit: oh yeah let me add, and this may be unpopular, ~~but ESH~~. Husband for being an irresponsible shit; and OP to both themself for tolerating this, and especially to the baby for birthing them into this absolute shitshow of a life\n\nEdit 2: after reading more comments and participating further OP YTA. Purposefully left out the part you are $100k in debt to get activity on the post so the N TA votes would get popular first. Actively playing down the fact he is an embezzler and that she has been enabling this bs the whole time, and again *BRINGING A FUCKING CHILD INTO THIS*", "It sounds like this is what needs to happen in OP\u2019s situation. Husband may have stopped gambling but he is still being reckless with money that the family needs.", "I had to do this with my ex-husband. I was trying to dig us out of his credit card debt. I made a budget and we each got an allowance each week. I made lunch for each of us every day, but he\u2019d blow his spending money on overpriced food and drinks at the snack bar at our office. Then he\u2019d want to pay less on the credit cards so he could go watch hockey at the bar or buy computer games or whatever. But I didn\u2019t give in. \n\nWe both worked and didn\u2019t have children. I can\u2019t imagine the overwhelm you must feel. \n\nThere are not-for-profit agencies that can help you make a plan to deal with debt like this. They would definitely tell him to knock it off with all this.", "Yes, sometimes I think I'm in a horrible place financially, but then I see something like this post.", "No, a part-time work from home job when she\u2019s already managing an under-one year old full time, a 10 year old outside school hours, the house and the cooking. That\u2019s already a full time job in itself and she has a chronic illness. Part time work would be hard for a fully healthy person to manage under these circumstances.", "Terrible impulse control and a propensity for gambling/addiction are indicators, though. So it could be an avenue to explore, along with other ideas here, if OP is looking to change the status quo and not just get some simpathy from internet strangers.", "He\u2019s also abusive. Why? Because this is Reddit.", "Mandated amount of break time still does not allot enough time for a sit down restaurant anymore. Also, managers (at good places) are the ones who forgo lunches to ensure their people get theirs.", "I think she said somewhere else it\u2019s embezzlement", "My adopted dad reminds me of this when I get frustrated with things I feel \"normal\" adults have a handle on, and I should, but don't, because I'm X years old. He points out when I started using, and my sobriety date. So, while I am actually X age, my emotional maturity, complex thinking, etc. is Y age. Granted, I have matured a lot in my currently 8 consistent years of sobriety, but I still struggle sometimes.", "Ideally, that process starts up again when they get sober.", "As a recovering addict I can attest to this- which is why there\u2019s a lot more to recovery then just stopping. It\u2019s work. And- speaking for myself- relapses set me back, not just in sobriety but in emotionally maturity and coping skills. It definitely takes a special kind of person to love us, even more so if we aren\u2019t doing what we need to stay healthy.", "Yup. My meth addict brother is 42 and acts 19.", "Good God! I live in the upper midwest, farm town. There would be boycotts and riots in the streets! And we're a pretty wealthy town! John Deere world headquarters is just 15 miles away, a lot of Deere execs live here, plus we have two gun armories here, their employees make bank.", "I think the point is that it may get to a point that it\u2019s either working from home part time or ending up homeless due to her husband\u2019s level of irresponsibility. Being a part time bookkeeper from home is definitely less demanding then taking care of a baby, so long term, she may need to find ways to make an income even if it\u2019s strenuous with her health condition.", ">sahm is already a full-time job \n\nthat's kinda the point. she can't work... but clearly she can work. childcare is not easier than a full time job. single income is a luxury nowadays, not a 'we're 100k in debt' situation.", "Ok but nobody forced her to have a new baby. Especially with the financial state they are in. If she has a 10 year old that is now in school most of the day she could've done a few hours of work. With an accounting job, could easily cover a housekeeper to help out around the house too and still have more money than the 0 she's currently earning. She went through college, has had two children, cooks every single night, grocery shops regularly... I would need to know every specific of her illness to understand why she can't sit at a computer for a few hours everyday.", "maybe not where you live. and we've already ascertained that the husband is an asshole, so why wouldn't he be the kind of manager to vanish.", "Oh she does.  Damn well I can see how that would add up as well.  Steal a bunch of money, gamble with it, win a bunch of money, owe taxes on it, lose everything because your bankroll was embezzled and you got caught, whoopsy daisy", "First off. It\u2019s awesome that you have that eight year of recovery under your belt. I\u2019m at about six and a half years into my own recovery. \nSecond, I\u2019m so glad that you have a dad that is understanding and supportive when you are feeling discouraged about where you\u2019re at. That\u2019s a huge deal.\nThink about it. The first couple of years of your recovery, if you\u2019re anything like me, you were probably in a place where you had a lot of damage control to take care of from when you were using. Finding a job. Housing. Legal issues. Stuff like that. It took a lot of time for me to get to the point where I was able to just get up and go about my day without having to handle anything that was caused by the person I was when I was in active addiction. When you consider how much of a time out you have to take from normal life, just to get to the point where you can HAVE a normal life, it stands to reason that you\u2019re not on the same page as everyone else your age. \nAnother HUGE thing that is going to affect how well those of us in recovery can \u201cadult\u201d, is the same thing that led a lot of us to start using substances to self medicate. A lot of people in addiction are dealing with trauma, either from before they used, or from the crazy life lived while getting high. Just getting off drugs is not enough to make that trauma disappear. \n\nIf you\u2019re emotionally dis regulated, you\u2019re going to struggle with the day to day things that others just seem to be doing without having to try. If you haven\u2019t already, maybe try and seek out a trauma informed therapist. I know DBT therapy has absolutely changed my thinking about how and why I do (or don\u2019t do) a lot of things. It taught me a lot about WHY I struggle with things, which helped a lot in learning ways to be able to do better. \n\nYou might be frustrated with yourself for not acting like you are X years old, but you are still doing something a lot of people who fall into addiction never manage to do. Be proud of that, if nothing else.", "That is so stupid. I started using drugs at 12. I went through 7 yrs in prison in my 20s before I stopped.....all the places I had been, all the people I had met, I was aged beyond my years. To the point where even now at 40 I can kick it with a 60 yr old all day and love it. I get they mean emotionally but it's honestly bullshit. Some addicts stay selfish into their adult years.", "You just...Do? I mean, I'm an addict and I'd like to think I've grown pretty significantly in the last few years. Relationships come and go in your life and you work towards goals that hopefully bring you personal satisfaction. You also have a bad habit or two that occasionally leads to some poor decisions lol.", "He could be neurodiverse, substance abuse is a comorbidity for ADHD for example. It would also help explain the emotional issues.", "Fast food is getting so expensive. I feel like I should dress nicer to go to the drive through.\ud83d\ude03", "Consider the fact that you're giving advice to a real person who probably actually cares somewhat about her husband and the father of kids, and probably cares more about working through their issues rather than getting some le epic own on their husband that some random Redditor suggested.", "Not to mention, they could BOTH work from home and husband could take some of the housekeeping duties. It doesn't even need to be one-sided.", "Yes, that was my point.", "Sure is convenient that they keep it vague huh", "Ok, let's continue to impose info that isn't evident in the post. It sounds like he \\*isn't\\* making management money (which retail management money, depending on company, is very little still) and that's why there's a problem in the first place.", "My dad has very bad ADHD and used meth to \"control it\" because Adderall didn't work. He's now in prison and has been clean for 8 years, but it's wild to me how poor he is at controlling his emotions. I'm lucky I can call him out and he doesn't get mad at me though, just sad and introspective.", "3-piece suit, don't forget the shirt and shoes!! You know it's a classy place if they have that posted on the door...\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m ADHD and the substance I\u2019ve used over the years to self soothe is alcohol, it settles me and I can even focus better. I\u2019m now medicated, late diagnosis, it\u2019s a stimulant and it calms my mind and takes the edge off. I have had issues all of my life with emotional disregulation and struggled for many years. My diagnosis helped me forgive my younger self and have a better understanding of why I am the way I am. Add in trauma therapy and I\u2019m slowly learning emotional regulation at 45, while I try to teach my small kids it. I\u2019m not defending your Dad, I just know how ADHD can derail some without proper help and support."]}
