The counselor corrected him and said he had \"uncommunicated expectations.\"  \n\nThis type of behavior grows resentment on both sides.  You're resentful of your wife not reading your mind.  She'll get resentful of your behavior towards her because she did the right thing by communicating.  If i can sum it up:  Use your fucking words.", "Literally taking the words out of my mouth.", "Thank you!  I appreciate the point of view!", "All of this. Its like he's taken a back seat in his own life then got resentful. Yta", "To me this is an ESH. Yes OP should speak up more, but its OPs birthday and he shouldn't be the one putting plans together, his wife should be. Why does the wife have nothing planned to celebrate the most important person in her life's birthday?", "it sounds like OP didn\u2019t tell wife about cosmic bowling, so she assumed he had no plans.", "I agree. I don\u2019t understand all the YTAs. If anything, his wife is communicating at least as poorly as him and added to that she\u2019s not being considerate about blowing off your birthday. I would take a look at your marriage because it says something that she doesn\u2019t at minimum try to make alternative birthday plans. It\u2019s ok to celebrate a day before or after but it sucks that she doesn\u2019t at least plan for a nice family meal when it\u2019s possible too. I hope that OP will take the comments to heart about communicating his needs better too.", "So glad I'm not the only one that noticed that, I once saw a gender neutral post on here where every third comment was asking for genders and I'm just like \"it shouldn't matter...?\"", "I wonder about the wife, but there is a chance that since OP has no friends, never says what he wants or likes, that she thinks he doesn't give a damn about his birthday. Also you don't have to celebrate your birthday in the exact day, you can have cake and sing and do something special some other day.\n\nFrom OPs passive aggressiveness my guess is that she either doesn't care anymore or doesn't know and it is tired of trying to guess. I know people like that, that act like they don't care but then cry a river when they don't get what they want. It is so tiring... When I say I don't care, I mean it. Now if they always do something special, or he always acts like he cares, she would be 100% an ah, but in this case my guess is he acts like it is not a big deal, lots of adults don't care about birthdays. I mean some celebrations get so awkward and depressing, with people like OP especially, that I can imagine many people not wanting to participate. The father o a cousin was like that, he acted like no big deal about his birthday, he wouldn't even blink at his presents, you had no clue if he liked them, the whole affair was miserable. He was angry if things didn't go exactly as he wanted, not like you knew what he wanted, children playing would annoy him. But if the wife didn't celebrate his birthday, if the wife didn't plan anything, all of the sudden his birthday was important. Although he wouldn't communicate it, he would just talk like OP, or get angry. So tiring.\n\nBut yes OP is certainly an ah, I am not 100% sure about the wife.", "Yes this is what i was thinking, 20 years never a thing, and now it is a thing but he doesn't say a word. Maybe the wife thinks he doesn't give a damn about his birthday. Also you don't have to celebrate your birthday in the exact day, you can have cake and sing and do something special some other day.\n\nAs I posted on another comment from OPs passive aggressiveness my guess is that she either doesn't care anymore or doesn't know and it is tired of trying to guess. I know people like that, that act like they don't care but then cry a river when they don't get what they want. It is so tiring... When I say I don't care, I mean it. And when I ask and get an answer like \"i guess\", i ask again, do you want it or not? Dont act like it is ok if it is not, act like you really want something if you want. But OP then lies, if they never do something special, I bet he even acts like it is not a big deal, lots of adults don't care about birthdays, so it is really not a big deal to believe him when he acts like he doesnt care. The father of a cousin was like that, he acted like no big deal about his birthday, he wouldn't even blink at his presents, you had no clue if he liked them, the whole affair was miserable. He was angry if things didn't go exactly as he wanted, not like you knew what he wanted, children playing would annoy him. But if the wife didn't celebrate his birthday, if the wife didn't plan anything, all of the sudden his birthday was important. Although he wouldn't communicate it, he would just talk like OP, or get angry. So tiring.\n\nOP just say what you want! There is no shame in wanting to celebrate your birthday. You still can, it can be on another day. But celebrate it and say what you want. You are not a victim here, you are 42.", "I think it is telling that he is acting like going out and have fun with the kids is somehow a punishment. I get it, children are tiring, but they are not a punishment, I think it can be super fun going out with them, since they are there you even get to goof off more and most people think is adorable.", ">As for the kids...again, you didn't tell her what YOU wanted to do. You don't HAVE to take your kids to all those activities just because she set them up. TALK to your kids and tell them that, for your birthday, you want to do something YOU want to do.\n\nExactly, this is the crux of the problem really. He seem so passive what he wants and how to commutate it.", "No\u2026I definitely don\u2019t think she\u2019s cold or uncaring\u2026I don\u2019t really enjoy big events or parties.  But I do appreciate the point about it being typical for us to not do anything.", "Hey, I took her to an Arcade Fire concert and to a night in the city.  \n\nWhen we got home I gave her a present which was a foam fist on an extending metal pole.  She complains that I snore so I told her that she could beat me with it to stop my snoring.  I also got her a Carvel Ice Cream Cake and made her sliders(my kids thought she\u2019d really like that\u2026.I\u2019m not so sure!)", "what when did OP ever elude to wanting everything to be perfect? Odd assumption he clearly is just an awkward dude. You wouldn\u2019t be hurt if your significant other didnt even consider a celebration with you. Let alone ask", "Well, i find it difficult to maintain friendships outside the work sphere because I do dedicate lots of time to my children and household.  My work is also very public facing and I do find it exhausting to socialize at times.  I appreciate your perspective.", "What are the activities you have to take the children to?", "I wouldn\u2019t say that it was a lie that I wanted her to go more like I would feel bad just making her sit home with me while her friend are out having a fun time with out her.  So I said yes or guess so.", "Oh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a punishment to go out with my kids at all!  It was really how I wanted to celebrate my birthday but on my terms not dictated by my wife who won\u2019t be there.", "Lots of people celebrate near their birthday instead of on it. Can you not do Cosmic Bowling on a different night and still celebrate the way you want?", "Dude. If you only knew how many of these ended up in \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for over a decade, I\u2019ve never made any type of effort for her but she didn\u2019t do anything for my birthday this year even though she\u2019s begged me for years\u201d.\n\nYou, however, should have communicated that you wanted her home and to plan something for you", "It's totally OK to not want to go to someone else's birthday party on your birthday or to want a smaller celebration because you're socially burnt out. But your wife can probably tell that you're miserable so I think it would do you both good if you can tell her why (without making her the bad guy).", "Dedicate less time to your wife and children. It's perfectly healthy to have some personal time for you and your friends", "I think you should remind your wife that it's your birthday that day and you had hoped to take the kids bowling that day.  Then, tell her to enjoy the party and spend the day with your kids. NTA. I hope that all these plans are a ruse, and she is doing something for you for your birthday. If not, she's forgotten your birthday, and her going to someone else's party is the least of your concerns.", "As others have said it is healthy to have friends. You will be a happier person. In case you say \"but my family\", a happier person can be a better father and husband. I just say it can be, because I mean it is not a given, but a person that is happy and content tends to be more kind.\n\nI see two main possibilities from your comments. Your wife is not very nice and doesn't really care about you, that is why she didn't care about your birthday. Or she is tired of you not saying what you want and never knowing can be stressful. Or she doesn't know (I guess they are 3 possibilities xD) because you don't speak.\n\nYou know your wife, which one it is? In any case, in life in general, is better to say what you want and not expect others to guess. People guess based on their life experiences, and each person experience life differently, so sometimes you will guess the same, sometimes you won't. And when you don't things can go really wrong, so why risk it?\n\nTalk, you have the right to want a birthday. Tell her you want a nice birthday celebration. That you would like to have one. Now is late to use that date, but you guys can go out another day.\n\nAnd take your children to bowling because that is what you want. Is there a chance she setup the other activities so you guys would have something to do while she wasn't around?", "You need to understand that people can't read minds. Some people are incredibly bad at it. So just say it. It is your birthday, you have the right to want to enjoy it. Now if you guys never do anything, it is not crazy for her to maybe want to go to her friends, which is something special. You can go celebrate yours another day. You celebrate one birthday a year, so in theory you could celebrate several days, there are people that go beyond, like birthday week or month. It is not a bad thing wanting to celebrate your birthday. It is what you want. Say it.", "Just tell her what your birthday plans are with your kids. She doesn\u2019t get to opt out of your birthday and then also dictate what you and your kids do. I would tell her what your plans are and if she wants your kids to participate in another activity, she will need to shuttle them herself. Just live your best life and if she wants to opt out, that\u2019s her problem!"]}
