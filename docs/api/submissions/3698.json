The counselor corrected him and said he had \"uncommunicated expectations.\"  \n\nThis type of behavior grows resentment on both sides.  You're resentful of your wife not reading your mind.  She'll get resentful of your behavior towards her because she did the right thing by communicating.  If i can sum it up:  Use your fucking words.", "Literally taking the words out of my mouth.", "Thank you!  I appreciate the point of view!", "All of this. Its like he's taken a back seat in his own life then got resentful. Yta", "To me this is an ESH. Yes OP should speak up more, but its OPs birthday and he shouldn't be the one putting plans together, his wife should be. Why does the wife have nothing planned to celebrate the most important person in her life's birthday?", "it sounds like OP didn\u2019t tell wife about cosmic bowling, so she assumed he had no plans.", "I agree. I don\u2019t understand all the YTAs. If anything, his wife is communicating at least as poorly as him and added to that she\u2019s not being considerate about blowing off your birthday. I would take a look at your marriage because it says something that she doesn\u2019t at minimum try to make alternative birthday plans. It\u2019s ok to celebrate a day before or after but it sucks that she doesn\u2019t at least plan for a nice family meal when it\u2019s possible too. I hope that OP will take the comments to heart about communicating his needs better too.", "So glad I'm not the only one that noticed that, I once saw a gender neutral post on here where every third comment was asking for genders and I'm just like \"it shouldn't matter...?\"", "I wonder about the wife, but there is a chance that since OP has no friends, never says what he wants or likes, that she thinks he doesn't give a damn about his birthday. Also you don't have to celebrate your birthday in the exact day, you can have cake and sing and do something special some other day.\n\nFrom OPs passive aggressiveness my guess is that she either doesn't care anymore or doesn't know and it is tired of trying to guess. I know people like that, that act like they don't care but then cry a river when they don't get what they want. It is so tiring... When I say I don't care, I mean it. Now if they always do something special, or he always acts like he cares, she would be 100% an ah, but in this case my guess is he acts like it is not a big deal, lots of adults don't care about birthdays. I mean some celebrations get so awkward and depressing, with people like OP especially, that I can imagine many people not wanting to participate. The father o a cousin was like that, he acted like no big deal about his birthday, he wouldn't even blink at his presents, you had no clue if he liked them, the whole affair was miserable. He was angry if things didn't go exactly as he wanted, not like you knew what he wanted, children playing would annoy him. But if the wife didn't celebrate his birthday, if the wife didn't plan anything, all of the sudden his birthday was important. Although he wouldn't communicate it, he would just talk like OP, or get angry. So tiring.\n\nBut yes OP is certainly an ah, I am not 100% sure about the wife.", "Yes this is what i was thinking, 20 years never a thing, and now it is a thing but he doesn't say a word. Maybe the wife thinks he doesn't give a damn about his birthday. Also you don't have to celebrate your birthday in the exact day, you can have cake and sing and do something special some other day.\n\nAs I posted on another comment from OPs passive aggressiveness my guess is that she either doesn't care anymore or doesn't know and it is tired of trying to guess. I know people like that, that act like they don't care but then cry a river when they don't get what they want. It is so tiring... When I say I don't care, I mean it. And when I ask and get an answer like \"i guess\", i ask again, do you want it or not? Dont act like it is ok if it is not, act like you really want something if you want. But OP then lies, if they never do something special, I bet he even acts like it is not a big deal, lots of adults don't care about birthdays, so it is really not a big deal to believe him when he acts like he doesnt care. The father of a cousin was like that, he acted like no big deal about his birthday, he wouldn't even blink at his presents, you had no clue if he liked them, the whole affair was miserable. He was angry if things didn't go exactly as he wanted, not like you knew what he wanted, children playing would annoy him.

Although he wouldn't communicate it, he would just talk like OP, or get angry. So tiring.\n\nOP just say what you want! There is no shame in wanting to celebrate your birthday. You still can, it can be on another day. But celebrate it and say what you want. You are not a victim here, you are 42.", "[deleted]", ">As for the kids...again, you didn't tell her what YOU wanted to do. You don't HAVE to take your kids to all those activities just because she set them up.

My work is also very public facing and I do find it exhausting to socialize at times.  I appreciate your perspective.", "What are the activities you have to take the children to?", "I wouldn\u2019t say that it was a lie that I wanted her to go more like I would feel bad just making her sit home with me while her friend are out having a fun time with out her.

If you only knew how many of these ended up in \u201cwe\u2019ve been married for over a decade, I\u2019ve never made any type of effort for her but she didn\u2019t do anything for my birthday this year even though she\u2019s begged me for years\u201d.\n\nYou, however, should have communicated that you wanted her home and to plan something for you", "It's totally OK to not want to go to someone else's birthday party on your birthday or to want a smaller celebration because you're socially burnt out.

It's perfectly healthy to have some personal time for you and your friends", "I think you should remind your wife that it's your birthday that day and you had hoped to take the kids bowling that day.  Then, tell her to enjoy the party and spend the day with your kids. NTA. I hope that all these plans are a ruse, and she is doing something for you for your birthday. If not, she's forgotten your birthday, and her going to someone else's party is the least of your concerns.", "As others have said it is healthy to have friends. You will be a happier person. In case you say \"but my family\", a happier person can be a better father and husband. I just say it can be, because I mean it is not a given, but a person that is happy and content tends to be more kind.\n\nI see two main possibilities from your comments. Your wife is not very nice and doesn't really care about you, that is why she didn't care about your birthday. Or she is tired of you not saying what you want and never knowing can be stressful. Or she doesn't know (I guess they are 3 possibilities xD) because you don't speak.\n\nYou know your wife, which one it is? In any case, in life in general, is better to say what you want and not expect others to guess. People guess based on their life experiences, and each person experience life differently, so sometimes you will guess the same, sometimes you won't. And when you don't things can go really wrong, so why risk it?\n\nTalk, you have the right to want a birthday. Tell her you want a nice birthday celebration. That you would like to have one. Now is late to use that date, but you guys can go out another day.\n\nAnd take your children to bowling because that is what you want. Is there a chance she setup the other activities so you guys would have something to do while she wasn't around?", "You need to understand that people can't read minds. Some people are incredibly bad at it. So just say it. It is your birthday, you have the right to want to enjoy it. Now if you guys never do anything, it is not crazy for her to maybe want to go to her friends, which is something special. You can go celebrate yours another day. You celebrate one birthday a year, so in theory you could celebrate several days, there are people that go beyond, like birthday week or month. It is not a bad thing wanting to celebrate your birthday. It is what you want. Say it.", "Just tell her what your birthday plans are with your kids. She doesn\u2019t get to opt out of your birthday and then also dictate what you and your kids do. I would tell her what your plans are and if she wants your kids to participate in another activity, she will need to shuttle them herself.

It's pretty yes but then I'm petty.", "NTA \n\nI understand feeling reluctant to tell her not to go. People usually don\u2019t get married to be second choice to their spouse\u2019s friends. She made her choice clear and you just didn\u2019t stand in her way. \n\nThis post reminded me of another post where a woman had to tell her husband not to do common sense things that would hurt her and the guy was weaponizing incompetence.\n\nFrom what I understand from the post, your wife was aware that this might hurt you. She asked your opinion but reacted negatively to your response. Is she reacting to a larger pattern of not getting clear answers from you or something else. \n\nMy wife, like you, just expects people to do each other right. I used to frequently hurt her accidentally because I naturally feel comfortable with pushing boundaries but I learned to notice when my personality becomes too much. I cared about her so I learned to advocate for her when she wouldn\u2019t.\n\nWith all that said, people can\u2019t read minds. Anything could be going on in her head.

THAT'S EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT blah blah.\" NTA and I'm sorry she doesn't want to plan a birthday dinner or date with you. She sucks.", "You are NTA. This isn't a communication issue. Your wife asked if it was okay to spend your birthday with someone else. Say that again to yourself a few times and punch yourself in the nose. I am betting if you asked her if you could spend her birthday with some chick celebrating her birthday or with your buddy celebrating his birthday, there would be hell to pay. You are married with kids. I know plenty of divorcees who need no prompting when deciding if an ex partner should have their kids or not. I would never fix my mouth to ask my wife something like this, because I love her. She also wouldn't ever do the same to me. I think you are heading for divorce bro. Married people don't do that to each other. You should ask for a backbone when you make the split. In my home there would have been a very nasty argument. Somethings are just not okay to ask for and it has nothing to do with communication. Don't believe me? If you are a female, ask your man for a threesome with two other guys that he isn't a part of.

This (to me) is clearly ESH.\n\nOP, commenters are right about the importance of communication. When your wife said, \u201cDo you mind\u2026\u201d this is the moment where honesty is the best policy. It\u2019s not about giving permission or saying no she can\u2019t go, but about vulnerability and communicating your **feelings.** E.g. \u201cWife, to be honest, I was hoping to celebrate my birthday as a family. It kind of hurts my feelings that you\u2019d rather spend my birthday with a friend celebrating her birthday.\u201d Your lack of honesty and communication makes you a soft AH.\n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s incredibly hurtful to actively plan not to be with your spouse on their bday without some serious extenuating circumstances. Not everyone wants a big celebration made out of their bday, but most people want to be with their favorite people on big days or important days. Even if the day was just cuddles and TV, your wife should have been talking to you about what you wanted to do on your bday and checking in and communicating about your wants and needs. While she asked if you\u2019d mind if she made alternate plans on your bday, the way she phrased it kind of makes it clear that she didn\u2019t plan or intend to plan anything on your bday, and that sucks and is hurtful.  The way something is communicated and the spaces in between can be just as important as communication in general. That makes her an AH.\n\nYou both need to do more communicating.", "I don't think you are TA, but I do think you should tell your wife to cancel the kids' activities that she scheduled so you can take them bowling.

I feel like info is indeed missing, but I honestly don't know who I suspect it would reflect poorly on. (Example questions: Did you tell your wife you wanted to do something else for your birthday? Is the reason your celebrations have historically been lackluster because you have never expressed a desire to do more? Does she have a history of verbally abusing you, and that's why you can't tell her that you already have a plan for you and the kids? Do you have a history of saying you're okay with things you aren't okay with and then getting upset when people believe you? Just feel like there's some piece of context missing here, but not knowing the story I can't say exactly what it is.)\n\nMy verdict as such: ESH.

A few weeks later, a huge fight how I didn't do anything to make them feel special. It gets exhausting. It really does.

If you read some of my comments you will see what I mean with you could be awful.\n\nSo, I don't think you are awful. I think you are just trapped in the fallacy that people that is close to you should somehow know what you want. If you have a hard time expressing your feelings, it is hard for people to guess what you feel. Maybe she feels like you don't enjoy your birthdays that much, or you don't care. I am glad she surprised you with a cookie cake. \n\nI think you should tell your wife that even though you don't show it too much, you really enjoy celebrating your birthday the way you always do. It may not seem like much, but for you is very special. If you have a hard time saying it outloud  you can write it on a letter.\n\nYou don't have to always communicate your feelings perfectly at the perfect time. You always have the chance to clarify things. And yes once you said yes to something you didn't want to say yes, it wouldn't be fair to say no, but you can offer a compromise. In this case you can tell her you guys can go bowling next week for your birthday, for example. And in general if you have a hard time saying what you think or feel in the moment, you can write letters. You are a team with your wife and children. You are not alone. Start thinking of you guys as a team. She needs to know what you think and feel to work with you. The way you communicate doesn't have to be the same than everyone else, you just do whatever works for you. But you are 42, you have power, you are not trapped, you can ask for things, you can change things.\n\nAlso I read a comment about snoring. I don't know how she took it, but you should read a bit on the effects of youu snoring in your spouse. If you snore a lot, she may be chronically sleep deprived, that is not good.\n\nAlso your wife maybe was really exited about going to her friends party but at the same time felt guilty about not spending it with you, but probably thought you really don't care much because you never do anything. So when you answered in that way she felt annoyed, because you were not clarifying the situation. You didn't say you really didn't care, you didn't say you do care. Next time talk more. Tell her you really want to spend it with her but if she is really exited about it maybe you can compromise celebrating earlier, etc.\n\nAnd finally, just because you are 42 it doesn't mean you don't have the right to enjoy your birthday. If you like your birthday and you want to celebrate it, you have every right to do it. Just some people could interpret you don't care about your birthday because you usually don't do anything for it.

She should have asked before making plans for you. \n\nYou guys need to work on communication", "My personal belief is either this post is fake or OP has omitted details because it would clearly make him the TA. The kids don't even want to do anything for their father on his birthday? No cake? No singing? Really?\n\nSo, if we take the post at face value neither his kids or wife have done anything for him for his birthday. No \"Happy Birthday.\" No cake. No presents. Nothing. Its hard to believe that to be true but if it is then clearly neither his wife or kids care about him at all. \n\nA meal date, or cake and candles, or doing a simple activity isn't super special or high expectation. Its not weird if she had planned any of that because its basic decency and respect. It shows you care.", "Sure, but I'm gonna put this out there, when one of my partners says that, I follow up. They do the same for me. It normally means the party that says it is caught off guard and is defaulting to a non-confrontational response because they have figured out their feelings (or how to articulate them) on the matter yet.", "I will tell you the same I told someone else.\n\nWe don't know how the relationship is.

I mean he might learn why his wife did what she did.\n\nI can imagine several scenarios where if she posted here why she did what she did people would say n t a, and I can think others where she would be the AH.

You would have to walk on eggs all the time. Absolutely everything annoyed him. He didn't even seem to like his own gifts, when it was his birthday. He would barely pay attention to anyone and watch tv. He would act like a victim if people were not kin to spend time with him. My cousin always hoped to have a nice birthday celebration with his family, it never happened. Every time arguments and yelling, most definitely someone wound up crying. Of course the women would do all the work, even during their own birthday, and they had to be careful not to anger the father, during their own birthday walking on eggs. And the tradition continued, why no one stopped it? because even though he didn't seem to enjoy birthdays, anyone's, he would make a freaking fuzz when they were not celebrated with him at home. He would just sit and watch TV, then eat, sing and eat some more. All the rest of the time yelling, well yelling when paying attention.\n\nYet when he talked with other people? He was the nicest, he was the victim, he was misunderstood. He just wanted to celebrate his birthday with his family. He wanted to be with the family. Everything OP said is the kind of thing he would say.\n\nSo if anyone on that family would have done what OPs wife did, they would be very justified. Matter of fact is what wound up happening, people drifting away, and still he thinks he is the victim. He doesn't understand why no one wants to talk to him or spend time with him.\n\nI don't know if OP is like that, we don't know. We know that he says \"I guess\" when he means \"no\". When he is asked directly he doesn't answer with the truth. When his wife arranges activities for his children, he says he wants to spend time with them, but acts like a victim, like he couldn't some how change that. Also he quite literally said he is annoyed his wife doesn't mind living him alone with the 3 kids by himself. They are his children, why would she mind that? I mean he in one sentence says that and in the next says he wanted to go bowling with them, so is he OK or not with having the children? He says he has no friends, but when invited to a party says he doesn't want to go because there are people he doesn't like. There is people you don't like literally everywhere, it doesn't mean you stay inside alone. Also I find very weird that she leaves during his birthday and feels the need to setup activities for the children, he says she doesn't mind leaving him alone with the kids, but clearly she does, she setup activities for them to keep them busy during his birthday.\nIt is also weird the kids doesn't seem to care about his birthday, that is not normal either. Because they should also want to spend it with him.\n\nNow he might just be introverted, he might just be shy, he might have low self-esteem. And she might be a big ah.

And also acts like he has no decision power. Whether this is the first situation, he having low self-esteem or his wife being an ah, he needs to speak up and he needs to act.

I wouldn't dare ask my bf if i could go to a friend's party on his birthday and I wouldn't have the time with what I plan for him anyways. OP NTA but stick up for yourself"]}
