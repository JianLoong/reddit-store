You have good reasons for not wanting to go. It's not in your budget, you can't bring your bf, you'll essentially be with strangers on a holiday. I think if you were her Maid of Honor or something, that would be different. But you're just a guest. You have every right to decline for any of those reasons.", "I suspect you are not the only one to decline. Having the wedding on NYE seems like a misguided decision. People want to spend this time with family and the loved ones they haven't been able to spend so much time with over the past few years. \n\nNTA. Nobody would choose to blow all that money in order to spend New Year's with strangers.", "NTA. People can invite and you can say no, it\u2019s totally reasonable. Maybe it\u2019s wedding stress, but your friend sounds dramatic and entitled.", "NTA, you make very good points. I can understand some disappointment on her end, but if she really \"went ballistic\" as you say, she is completely overreacting. She should have planned a wedding that was not on a major holiday imo, but in any case, NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is TA and incredibly self-centered.\n\nAn invitation is not a command performance. You are allowed to say no.", "NTA. Planning your wedding during a holiday normally spent with family and friends and expecting people being able to attend is also an odd move.", "She's being selfish. She can have her wedding anytime and anywhere she wants. It doesn't mean that everyone she wants to attend has the time or can afford to attend. Send her a nice gift with your well wishes. If that's not enough for her - and she expects you to spend more than you can afford for HER wedding - well, she's not a very good friend.", "NTA, you are fully reasonable here.", "NTA\n\nNeither are you being selfish, spend Hogmanay with your BF and see your friend in the spring.\n\nYour friend is just disappointed", "NTA.

Send a gift.", "NTA\n\nNYE wedding, alone, destination\u2026pass", "Nta. Of course she wishes you were there and you wish that you could attend, but your reasons for not attending are legitimate.

Not many people can afford to attend an out of area wedding straight after Christmas.\n\nDue to no fault of your own, it sounds like this friendship is done because of her reaction.", "NTA... invitees are allowed to say no. Hopefully, this behaviour is outside the norm, and you can chalk it up to stress. My guess is a few people have probably declined or are unable to give an answer due to the same reasons you expressed.", "NTA at all. I was invited to a NYE wedding a couple years ago and I really wanted to go but it was ludicrously expensive. Travel logistics alone were a nightmare to contemplate and that\u2019s just something that the couple needs to take into account when inviting people. It\u2019s completely reasonable to decline an invitation (for any reason, but especially these reasons) and your friend is overreacting.", "That's what I was thinking. I'm not in the wedding party, so I didn't think it would be a big deal.", "Exactly this. A big wedding like this really shouldn\u2019t be on NYE. OP is definitely NTA. If you want to do a holiday wedding, keep it to close family and friends only because then those people do actually want to be there.", "She\u2019s being ridiculous, unfair and it is unrealistic for her to expect you to spend NYE at the wedding and leave your bf behind. Had she given you a plus one you and your bf could have made a little trip out of the wedding. \n\nPlus you have to fly back literally hours after the wedding ends as I\u2019m guessing the wedding may end after midnight into January 1st to be back in time for work. And it\u2019s very expensive. Just the words \u2018unfortunately I can\u2019t afford to make the trip\u2019 should be enough.", "NTA. If she really wanted you there in the first place, she\u2019d have given you a plus one so you wouldn\u2019t be spending all that time alone.", "Holiday weddings deserve poor attendance.", "NTA. . The selfish ones are people who try to hijack the holiday for their own personal event and expect everybody to bend over backwards to make sure that happens. Selfish ones would also to be the people who expect folks who are already giving up their holiday to be separated from their loved ones on said holiday. That's not you in the scenario. A gracious and understanding host would be like yeah I know my request is completely unreasonable. We're still very sorry and completely understand when you can't make it. Did your friend say any of that? No? Are you sure she's your friend?", "NTA. she is rather unreasonable", "NTA\nOnce she lost the plot at you not wanting to attend,  she stopped being your friend. Other people don't get to dictate how you spend your time, shw asked,  you declined,  end of story.", "NTA. And brides: quit expecting people to come solo to your wedding. No excuse. None. This bullshit about not wanting strangers there. Puhleeze. Not when you have 300 guests. As if you know all your fianc\u00e9s\u2019 third cousins. Cry me a river.", "NTA shes not being a very good friend. Disappointment makes sense but getting mad at you? Calling you an asshole? Not cool. Its literally a party. A far away party that costs 1000 or more to get to, filled with hundreds of people you dont know and the one person you do know will be busy the whole time because as stated theres hundreds of people there all for her because shes getting married. Your not even a wedding party member. \nMy best friend lives in another state. If i was getting married and she couldnt make it because of the expense/ not wanting to miss holidays with family know what i would do? Set up a gosh darn zoom so my friend can be a part of my wedding without taking a financial hit for it. Its 2023 theres options", "NTA I tried getting a ticket around this December and holy smokes!! The ticket alone went up to $500! Flying around this time is expensive", "NTA. A wedding invitation is not a summons. And you should never spend money you don't want to for someone else's event. Her reaction is further proof you made the right decision. I hope she calmed down (though I suspect she didn't). She probably had a lot of people declining to travel on an expensive weekend.", "NTA. NYE (and all holiday) weddings are difficult to attend and kind of selfish. Your friend should be understanding. She should also invite your bf given the circumstances.", "The no +1 for a NYE wedding is insane. The rest of it is also insane. Your friend is insane.\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "Plus it\u2019s \u201cAmateur Night\u201d with drunks on the road. No one smart wants to go anywhere NYE", "It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons.", "Also, tho altogether it would be more money, if your bf came it would be more affordable per person \u2014 and like you said you\u2019d have someone to spend the downtime w which justifies the expense a little more. \n\nYour friend is upset and taking it personally bc she wants you there, her reaction is big (and I imagine her feelings are prob pretty big in general right now), but your rationale is completely justified and logical. \n\nAlso, just to be clear, you\u2019d likely be spending way over $1000.", "From her reaction it, I\u2019d bet a lot of people are saying the same thing. She\u2019s frustrated and she just took it out on you.  NTA", "Some people are so extra when it comes to \u201ctheir big day\u201d that statistically will end in divorce anyway. Just go to the courthouse and stop wasting people\u2019s time and money.", "NTA\n\nHaving to be back at work on Jan 2 would do it for me.  Flying is crazy anyway, but add in higher air fares + holiday travel crowds + potential for bad weather causing flight delays and I would nope right out of that.\n\nI don't know what this couple was thinking picking NYE as a wedding date.", "NTA. You were not an ahole for declining; her response was rude.\n\nAn invite is not a command to appear. She made her plans, and they are logistically and financially hard for you. Real reasons. You made your decision and have sent your regrets. You did everything you should have done.\n\nEven if you were declining for silly reasons - you want to stay home and watch the ball drop in Time Square on tv. That is your decision to make and not for her to argue with you about, much less insult you over! She could judge you in her mind or ask if you couldn't reconsider or tell you how sad she is you won't be there - but what she did was completely uncalled for. She's not quite as mature as one might have expected.", "NTA. An invitation is NOT a subpoena. And it is never acceptable to argue over a politely declined invitation.", "NTA an invitation is an ask not a demand.", "NTA.\n\nI never understand this.  Anyone throwing a party, but brides especially have a bad case of \"main character syndrome\" in which all the bit players in their life are expected to show up on cue, no questions asked.  Was it an RSVP or a summons?  \n\nNot allowing you to bring a +1 to a 300-person event shows you exactly where you actually rate in her hierarchy of friends and family.  Ignore her outburst.  Send a gift, if you like, and see if she returns to normal next year.", "NTA.  She picked an extremely expensive time of year to get married.  Not many people want to go to a wedding on NYE.  It\u2019s a big hassle and $$$$$.  She has every right to have her wedding when and where she wants but she\u2019s unreasonable to get mad when people decline.", "NTA. I too have to go to a new years wedding this year (fianc\u00e9s close friend from college), and had similar concerns for not going. The couple also chose not to include most plus ones (I was an exception because I\u2019ve been around so long they both know me decently well). But many of their friends have RSVP\u2019d no because they don\u2019t want to spend their holiday at a wedding. It\u2019s just a risk you take when you have a holiday wedding (and if I\u2019m honest, I really hate the fact that it\u2019s on new years).", "Please don't over think this - I missed my cousin's wedding because I had two small children and didn't want to travel across the country.  We were close (about the same as you and your friend - but actually related!).  She understood and we see each other every couple of years when we are in close proximity.  This may be the end of your friendship, which would be sad, but you are entirely reasonable here."]}
