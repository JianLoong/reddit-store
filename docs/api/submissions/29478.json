You have good reasons for not wanting to go. It's not in your budget, you can't bring your bf, you'll essentially be with strangers on a holiday. I think if you were her Maid of Honor or something, that would be different. But you're just a guest. You have every right to decline for any of those reasons.", "I suspect you are not the only one to decline. Having the wedding on NYE seems like a misguided decision.

Maybe it\u2019s wedding stress, but your friend sounds dramatic and entitled.", "NTA, you make very good points. I can understand some disappointment on her end, but if she really \"went ballistic\" as you say, she is completely overreacting. She should have planned a wedding that was not on a major holiday imo, but in any case, NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is TA and incredibly self-centered.\n\nAn invitation is not a command performance. You are allowed to say no.", "NTA. Planning your wedding during a holiday normally spent with family and friends and expecting people being able to attend is also an odd move.", "She's being selfish. She can have her wedding anytime and anywhere she wants. It doesn't mean that everyone she wants to attend has the time or can afford to attend. Send her a nice gift with your well wishes. If that's not enough for her - and she expects you to spend more than you can afford for HER wedding - well, she's not a very good friend.", "NTA, you are fully reasonable here.", "NTA\n\nNeither are you being selfish, spend Hogmanay with your BF and see your friend in the spring.\n\nYour friend is just disappointed", "NTA.  Money is money is money.  If you can't afford something, you can't.  She made her choice, you make yours.  Don't feel the least guilty.  Send a gift.", "NTA\n\nNYE wedding, alone, destination\u2026pass", "Nta. Of course she wishes you were there and you wish that you could attend, but your reasons for not attending are legitimate.

My guess is a few people have probably declined or are unable to give an answer due to the same reasons you expressed.", "NTA at all. I was invited to a NYE wedding a couple years ago and I really wanted to go but it was ludicrously expensive. Travel logistics alone were a nightmare to contemplate and that\u2019s just something that the couple needs to take into account when inviting people. It\u2019s completely reasonable to decline an invitation (for any reason, but especially these reasons) and your friend is overreacting.", "That's what I was thinking. I'm not in the wedding party, so I didn't think it would be a big deal.", "Exactly this. A big wedding like this really shouldn\u2019t be on NYE. OP is definitely NTA. If you want to do a holiday wedding, keep it to close family and friends only because then those people do actually want to be there.", "She\u2019s being ridiculous, unfair and it is unrealistic for her to expect you to spend NYE at the wedding and leave your bf behind. Had she given you a plus one you and your bf could have made a little trip out of the wedding. \n\nPlus you have to fly back literally hours after the wedding ends as I\u2019m guessing the wedding may end after midnight into January 1st to be back in time for work. And it\u2019s very expensive. Just the words \u2018unfortunately I can\u2019t afford to make the trip\u2019 should be enough."]}
