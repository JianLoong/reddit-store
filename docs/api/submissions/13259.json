I've found that leaving an open ended response like \"OH not right now. Maybe later\" just translates to \"not at the second, ask me again in a few months. Then again in a year. Then again till the answer is yes\". \n\nI've explained my list of reasons why to a few of the repeat offenders and all I get in return is them trying to explain why my reasons are BS. Biggest ones being 1.) bad mental health runs in both sides (things I personally deal with that hinder my day to day life) 2.) physical health is bad on both sides including a rare and potentially genetical disease (800 in the world with known cases and signs strongly suggestioning its genetical ) that I don't want to risk even the smallest chances of passing to a child. \n\nAll my reasons get tossed out because \"You raised your dog very well\" and \"You are a great babysitter\" and \"But you love the relative that has that disease\"", "created_utc": 1679856421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122vi5p/aita_for_saying_if_i_do_get_pregnant_no_one_would/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
