You have made yourself clear and anything past that, if they keep asking, you are by no means an ahole on how you state your answer.", "NTA. \nIf they're offended, I'd think they offended you first by not taking the goddamn hint. \nSome people don't want kids. That's perfectly okay.", "I'm in a similar situation. NTA. I will share 3 tips on what I've found to be effective for coping with this longterm though.\n\n\nIt gets better! Once you hit 30, people largely calm down. Unfortunately it is friggin persistent. It has tapered off, but I do still get it. When a coworker went on pregnancy leave, the older women in my workplace were high on baby mania and started circling like vultures.  \nCall out sick because of nausea and vomiting? Came back to so many \"was it morning sickness?!?\" jokes. I started answering \"nah I had my period only last week. It was hard to miss.\" 1, Sometimes the blatant answers and honestly are the only way to go, if only so you can cope yourself. \n\n\nI've tried various comments over the years. In my most frustrated moments when I was 20, I resorted to dead baby jokes. So if you went too far, I've said worse lol. \n\n2, you can be very boring and go gray rock. No is a complete sentence. Silence is also an answer. Revel in the awkward.\n\n\nWhen I hit 30, I got even more pissed off at \"biological clock\" comments, especially in retrospect. I heard that BS so often in my early 20s!! You know what the \"clock\" actually does? You get HORNY. Biology doesn't need to make you want babies at all, it just has to get you to do a fun thing with other humans.\n\nThere's some indications that the process of pregnancy and inundation of those hormones might change emotional triggers. My memory of this is based on a study with female rats who showed fear response towards strange rat pups, except when in a late stage of pregancy. Then their reactions changed towards caretaking. Like, in a matter of days their reactions could be totally different. My personal pet theory is that all the anecdotes of \"Blah di blah hated babies, too, but then she got pregant and has 5 kids now\" might have more to do with that. \n\nSo, 3, you can also go on a full out hyperfixated rant about hormone processes, expectations of women versus reality, false ideas about how these hormones actually function as well as women's sexuality, and the long history of birth control. Did you know a plant in Greece went extinct because it was used for birth control? Who knows if it was effective, they used it all before the Middle Ages! There is a long history of people who did not want kids! \nPeople will either be on board with the topic and you get a fascinating conversation, or they learn that they'll be subject to an eye-glazing verbal essay train if they try to talk about this with you. \n\n\nIn short, go unhinged.

When you set a boundary you don't need the other side to agree and you can't control their behaviour. You can't stop the questions you can only decide how you respond. \n\nWhen people ask you can very directly say, \"I'm not comfortable discussing my sex life\" or \"pregnancy is such a personal issue, I find it's not a good thing to ask questions about\" or with the more persistent folk \"that's a very intrusive question, I can't believe you'd ask it. How embarrassing for you\" and then just move on. Or just act like they're making a joke \"oh haha, i agree people are so weirdly obsessive about other people's bodies\". If you start treating it like a joke they're likely just to shut up. \n\nLastly, with closer family and friends if you haven't directly said \"I will not discuss pregnancy with you. If you raise it, I will leave the conversation\" you need to. You think you've made it clear but making oblique comments, hints and jokes often doesn't convey your meaning. It may feel very blunt but being direct is very important.", "Or he likes to be pegged (technically the butt as well)"]}
