You could be the first to do so. Also, from what I understand, inflation has made life very very hard.   Can you blame him for wanting to make extra money?", "NTA. They were totally planning on selling your hair. It's a pretty common thing actually. Even in the U.S. Reputable places will either inform you of what they do with the hair collected (though you might have to ask.) Or immediately offer if you want to keep your hair if it's a certain length or offer a discount for allowing them to.\n\n There's a huge market in natural human hair. Especially virgin hair. (Long, never dyed, bleached, pressed, processed.) And there are a lot of people who take advantage of peoples ignorance of these things or will even sink to terrible acts to aquire hair for the money they can get. (My little sister has nearly ankle length, rich, thick, straight dark black/brown hair. She has had been accosted a couple of times with creeps trying to literally rob her for it.) \n\nThat stylist was peeved because he didn't get that extra cash. Which IDK if it's the same as where many of my family is from south of the U.S, but even $50 is very nice price  for selling a bundle of hair. Most of my friend and family here in the U.S pay around $100 per bundle when we sew in extensions or make pieces. When I do theater, or costume work the cost oftentimes even more.", "NTA. Out of principle I'd do the same.\n\nYou can't just charge someone for a haircut and then claim their hair as your own damn property. And if it's worth that much, you def deserve that profit for putting in the care of growing it", "How did you know he was going to sell it?\nPutting it in a band before cutting it is way better than having all that hair just fall and having to clean it up after. They whispering may have just been because it\u2019s an odd request.", "NAH. \n\nIt\u2019s your hair so you can keep it if you want to but he wouldn\u2019t be TA if he kept it to sell. I mean, it\u2019s either that or they sweep it up and throw it in the trash", "Ur the ah", "Nah. He didn't ask because we'll the usual assumption is that uts gonna be on the floor.

BIZNESS.", "Yeah I'm not getting these people getting all territorial about something they almost certainly leave lying on the floor after every haircut without a second thought.

That still makes you an AH.", "It\u2019s not a donation id you\u2019re getting paid for it, either. It\u2019s a sale. The person who grew the hair can profit off it if she wants. The hairdresser needs to get permission.", "I think it's reasonable to assume that most people don't have disposal plans for their shorn hair and expect to just leave it on the barber's floor unless they say otherwise so I see no reason for the stylist to ask permission to keep it.", "Thank you!", "That\u2019s not really true. A lot of consignment shops donate the items if the owner doesn\u2019t want them back or doesn\u2019t reply when they\u2019re unsold within the time specified terms of their contract. The consignment shop has *no basis* in the donated item and as such receives no write off (unless they pay the consigned a fee for the items). But lots of people do in fact donate other peoples things. \n\nIf it is cash, investments, collectibles they\u2019ll sell or donate them and hold the funds as being escheated to the state for a certain number of years before those funds are repurposed in the budget.", "I am completely fine with my cut off hair being thrown out. I am insanely uncomfortable at the concept of it being collected and kept or sold by anyone other then myself. I would happily donate my hair, but *I* would be doing it.
