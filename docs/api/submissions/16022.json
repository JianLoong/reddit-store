I'm french and I have been living in Canada for the last 6 years. I go back to my country almost every year to visit them. I have always thought my sister and I had a great relationship, she was the first person I wanted to see, the most important person in my life. We used to text and facetime several times a week. \n\nLast August, I arrived at my sister's to spend 4 days with her and my nephews. 1 hour after I arrived she started complaining about my behavior during my last visit, she was not happy that I did not made her husband's lunch one day. I voiced my surprise that she kept her feelings toward this for a year. She apparently wanted to tell me in person.\nDuring the rest of my stay she made me feel not welcomed in her home and made excuses to come home very late. I was hurt by this, but stayed because I wanted to spend time with my nephews. On the 3rd night I wanted to talked it out with her because I sensed it was deeper than the husband's lunch.\n\nShe spent 2 1/2 hours listing everything that she did not like about me, my behavior, my life choices, my personality. I was sobbing for the most part and unable to answer, but she kept on going, unfazed. Her list was going back to when I was 5 and refused to play with her (I ve always been a loner), to our teenage years and the fact she chose to go to school so far that she was only back on the weekends, meaning that she did not think we were sisters then. Same when we went to the same university and saw each other almost everyday, she stated that we were friends during that time, not sisters. Later in life, she asked me to officiate her wedding ceremony and to be the godmother of one of my nephew. I sense that she is very disappointed that I decided to stay in Canada and I believe that she started resenting me when she realized I was not coming back to France. She also mentioned that I was way to happy to talk about the promotion I had at work, and to let her know I was no longer struggling financially. She also said I should not call her that often and should wait for her to authorize me to call (by text).

I spent the rest of my vacation being sad, but also angry that she did not talked to me sooner but chose to do it during my only vacation of the year.\n\nWhen I saw her again on my last day, I told her I was really not happy about our conversation, that even though some remarks made sense, some of them were just mean. I finished by letting her know that since she did not seems to like me, she was no longer invited to visit me.

She basically broke you down instead of having a conversation. Then expected you to go along with her terms to be her sister.", "NTA Your sister went way too far - she basically told you that she\u2019s only willing to have a relationship with you if it\u2019s on her terms all the time. It\u2019s completely understandable that you reject her terms. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s awful to you.", "NTA, this sounds unhinged. \n\nIf she had that many grievances she should have handled them like a grown up at the time instead of collecting them and reaching for them back to grade school. \n\nY\u2019all were friends in college but not sisters?? You\u2019re too happy about a promotion and financial stability?? \n\nThere has to be something more at play here. Either way distance sounds like a good choice.", "NTA, your sister went nuclear on you and basically said she hates you or at least does not like you and only wants to interact with you based on her one-sided rules. She listed grievances from when you were 5 and did not want to play with her, that's insane I would go NC with her and forget about her.", "NTA. That's the risk she took when she decided to vent all of her life's frustrations of you. It created a toxic (to you) relationship, and you don't need that in your life", "Sounds like she mentally is a load to deal with. For her to hold grudges for that long and over trivial things sounds a bit crazy too. I agree take a break from her.", "NTA. I\u2019d stay away from her, she needs to apologize and beg for your forgiveness. If she kept going while you were sobbing, she was enjoying it.", "Your sister is jealous of your freedom and lifestyle. She does not deserve to be a guest in your house. Her husband can make his own damn sandwich. Her goal was to destroy the life and confidence you have. Give her space see her when you go home but not in your space.", "NTA. Why would you want to host someone that spent your vacation time berating you for things that have taken place over a thirty year span? She seems to have held onto grudges and sat back and judged every decision you have made in your life. Best to keep the relationship at a distance.", "INFO: who ended up making your husband\u2019s lunch?", "You need to decide whether you want to cut ties permanently or try to heal it. Either choice is ok, but if you want to heal it, the only way is to spend time together, this time in your comfort zone. Not easy", "nta, she told you she didn't really feel like your sister, and was bringing up grievances for when you were five, it's been 30 years and she only decided to tell you now? And then she's acting like everything will be fine, after all that, you are definitely nta.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s jealous of your life", "Maybe you should have slept with her husband to?? Why in the hell would you be expected to make her husband lunch, it's her damn husband.", "I feel like E S H or N A H. I don't know yet. It seems like she's been holding onto a lot and kind of unleashed it on you in an unfair way.

I'm sorry she treated you that way.", "NTA", "NTA-I know a lot of family grows apart, but from what you wrote, you felt like you were close. Obviously don\u2019t know her or you but she maybe could be a bit jealous that you have this life away, a different life while she is living more of a familial life, with a husband and kids. The list and things that happened as kids, husband\u2019s sandwich is all too weird for a sisterly relationship.", "NTA what the f is her problem, still mad that 32 years ago when she was 7 her 5-year-old sister would not play with her?  2 1/2 hours of belittling you. She is upset that you are finally financially stable? You cannot call her until she texts you saying it is ok.

It wasn\u2019t ok. You very much are NTA to put up a boundary and not allow that to potentially (probably?) happen again.", "^^ This. She was totally enjoying making you cry. What a piece of work. You are definitely NTA. I'd go full NC. You do not need that level of toxic in your life.", "I mean, it\u2019s been over a year.
