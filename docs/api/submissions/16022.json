She is selfish an ignorant and understands you as an asset and servant.", "This post brought back a lot of childhood trauma from growing up with my sister. Despite being only two years older we were never close until her last year of high school. It was like a switch turned on and we realized we can be friends and close and it was insane how good our relationship became until I went to college. I was so excited for both of us to live together and have our faculties a building away from each other. We were best friends for three years that we could basically read each other's minds. But slowly her behavior turned severely toxic. She was overly possessive of her friends and nitpicked everything about me. From my clothes to who I hung out with to what I liked. And when we fought, she dredged up things from our childhood that I had no recollection of and even the awful things she had done to me I couldn't remember any of them because I stupidly didn't hold on to when I was wronged at the time.\n\nThings came to a head when all we could do was just argue and fight so we just stopped talking until our family eventually got all together (they were abroad) and she got closer to my younger sister instead. It sucked to be alone, but was much better than being around her venomous tongue and superhuman ability to only remember being wronged since she was born but can never be accountable for her own mistakes. It was a relief when she found a job abroad. It was easier to tolerate her unless she came home for long trips during the summer. Everyone in the family knew we shouldn't anger the beast so they allowed her to do whatever just because she wasn't staying for long. I didn't. Which meant our fights continued until she eventually got married and became a mom. That was the only time she finally stopped being toxic towards me and has actually been super nice. We're not close by any means but we can actually talk now. She's super toxic to everyone else, though. But at least she knows not to cross me with her shit.", "NTA, but since it\u2019s your sister, maybe it would be good to have her visit and you guys could have a bigger conversation about all of this and make up.

Family is who loves you and is there for you. \nMy brother and I have an awful relationship and he used to do stuff like this, including blaming me for things when I was a literal toddler, because he resented my birth, which coincided with our parents' marriage falling apart.

He took after our dad, and I moved on with my life, got therapy and didn't repeat our parents' choices)\n\nIt sounds like your sister held on to every slight, real or perceived, for DECADES. You don't want that in your life. I cut my brother off after a similar experience, after our mom died. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

He\u2019s the Asshole.", "\ud83d\udcaf agree", "My brother and I are also NC because if something similar. It hurts, but also I\u2019m pissed because he didn\u2019t say anything before he just stopped contacting us. I was like dude at least let\u2019s talk about it, but nope.
