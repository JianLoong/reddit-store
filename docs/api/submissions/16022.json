She is selfish an ignorant and understands you as an asset and servant.", "This post brought back a lot of childhood trauma from growing up with my sister. Despite being only two years older we were never close until her last year of high school. It was like a switch turned on and we realized we can be friends and close and it was insane how good our relationship became until I went to college. I was so excited for both of us to live together and have our faculties a building away from each other. We were best friends for three years that we could basically read each other's minds. But slowly her behavior turned severely toxic. She was overly possessive of her friends and nitpicked everything about me. From my clothes to who I hung out with to what I liked. And when we fought, she dredged up things from our childhood that I had no recollection of and even the awful things she had done to me I couldn't remember any of them because I stupidly didn't hold on to when I was wronged at the time.\n\nThings came to a head when all we could do was just argue and fight so we just stopped talking until our family eventually got all together (they were abroad) and she got closer to my younger sister instead. It sucked to be alone, but was much better than being around her venomous tongue and superhuman ability to only remember being wronged since she was born but can never be accountable for her own mistakes. It was a relief when she found a job abroad. It was easier to tolerate her unless she came home for long trips during the summer. Everyone in the family knew we shouldn't anger the beast so they allowed her to do whatever just because she wasn't staying for long. I didn't. Which meant our fights continued until she eventually got married and became a mom. That was the only time she finally stopped being toxic towards me and has actually been super nice. We're not close by any means but we can actually talk now. She's super toxic to everyone else, though. But at least she knows not to cross me with her shit.", "NTA, but since it\u2019s your sister, maybe it would be good to have her visit and you guys could have a bigger conversation about all of this and make up.

Family is who loves you and is there for you. \nMy brother and I have an awful relationship and he used to do stuff like this, including blaming me for things when I was a literal toddler, because he resented my birth, which coincided with our parents' marriage falling apart.

He took after our dad, and I moved on with my life, got therapy and didn't repeat our parents' choices)\n\nIt sounds like your sister held on to every slight, real or perceived, for DECADES.

NTA Cut that tumor off.", "That was not a conversation.  She dumped on you and that was not right.  Take the space you need to figure out what you want to do about the relationship.", "You let her go on for over 2 hours without putting a stop to her? You're NTA for cancelling the invite, but you've been a total AH to yourself for not standing up for yourself sooner than later. Better late than never but wow this was a frustrating read. Always sad to see someone's perception of a \"normal\" relationship (platonic, familial, or romantic) be so skewed. Your sister's a menace and I can't believe the gall from her end to act upset. She either doesn't feel like what she did was wrong, or saw it as a necessity by way of \"honesty\" (AKA just \"telling it like it is\" or \"being blunt\").", "NTA this is new behavior since last year, so you might ask your BIL if he has noticed anything and if he can get her assessed for mental issues. Staying out late, distant behavior, personality changes, and hostility to questions suggest something is wrong with her.", "NTA.  You are sparing her further misery about you by cancelling her visit.  She would complain if she visited if you were obviously happy, doing well, and not reliant on her alone (meaning friends).  She may need to be the important one; the successful one, the happy one. \n\nSo cancelling the visit of someone who has very little good will toward you and lots of grievances is sparing that person a miserable experience.", "Very weird conversation", "Um, NTA your sister is a rotten person. Who degrades a person for 2.5 hours and then claps their hands together and \"well then! Now we can be sisters again! All better!\"\n\nThat's called a no thanks", "Or it sounds like my family. I remember sitting at a dinner once where my (then) 52 year old aunt screamed at my 49 year old mother about a doll that my mom broke when she was two years old. She did it on purpose, screamed my aunt. My mom always hated my aunt. And this ... this was actually normal for the whole family.\n\nSome people are grudge holders. Holding grudges is my family's worst trait. I try not to although I realize I do. Just not the way they do. Honestly, I hated family get-togethers because this sort of thing (the listing of grievances - ha) was the norm. Ugh.", "Yeah, I thought that was bad until she got to the part about when OP was 5.", "I have the same relationship with my brother, went NC about 3 years ago (finally stopped caring about my mom being upset about it, otherwise I would have done it a decade earlier).

It will help.\n\nAny conversation would have been just for you anyway. Do you really think he would have listened? Would he have heard you? \n\nIt's worth getting out, but saying it to him will be pointless.", "I was the executor.  We had a choice of not going through probate. He knew if he didn't kiss my backside, that I would go through probate and that would really drag out him getting his share.  If you are going through probate, let the attorney deal with him.  In the meantime, make sure that you have your Mom's financial and medical POAs.  I had them.  He hated it. I called all the shots.", "I'm a legal assistant, so I'm all good on the legal front.

She gets this list of what's wrong with you off her chest and now everything is fine? She doesn't feel the two of you are sisters. You haven't changed. The past hasn't changed. She's authorizing phone time. You're supposed to open your home to her? \n\nMight be time to cut that particular connection, maybe not. Give it some time. Envy is an issue from the sounds of things. Maybe she thought baring her soul would clear the air so the two of you could build the kind of relationship sisters have? Sorry you had to hear all of that. Best of luck.", "NTA, but your sister is. She dumped years of crap on you, that made her feel better so you should be fine now - like what the actual @#$%. I would be tempted to say \u201cok, you got stuff of your chest and feel better, in the interest of taking our relationship to a better place - I agree that to move forward we need to clear the air, so my turn now\u201d. But I am petty like that.\n\nShe is jealous of you. I hope you get back home and continue to live your best life.\n\n\\*\\*edited to add - you didn\u2019t make her husband lunch when you were visiting, are his arms painted on.", "NTA. Your sister is unhinged for airing grievances that are decades old. Going NC is the best thing you can do.", "My sister did this kind of thing to me too, and honestly our relationship never recovered. I don't really have advice on navigating this. Not wanting her to visit is completely reasonable and you're NTA.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Losing a sister like this is so hard, and the fact she bottled it up for years and years is terrible. The fact she felt 'better' after ripping you apart is disgusting, I had the same thing said to me after I'd been crying for hours. Your sister is so callous and rude, I hope she can grow enough as a person to apologize and you can repair the relationship, eventually.", "NTA. To keep that much negativity bottled for so long and let it all out at once in an hours long rant is total nonsense. Being an American I am sure there are cultural differences in how family members interact but your sisters behavior seems way out of line and overly hurtful.", "NTA for telling her she\u2019s not welcome to visit anymore.\n\nThat said I\u2019m wondering do you want to have a relationship with her? It sounds like you do, or at the very least are mourning the relationship you thought you had. Do you want to have that relationship? Or do you not see this as salvageable?\n\nI think maybe writing her a letter outlining how hurtful her barrage was because you THOUGHT you had the relationship she says you can \u201cgo forward\u201d with and holding on to literal lifelong grudges is deeply unhealthy and unloading them on you was purposeful hurtful. That this is what therapy is for. \n\nShe sounds resentful and petty. I think you should think about what you actually want here. If you want a relationship with your sister it sounds like meditation or some sort is in order. Personally I\u2019d be gutted but would be incredibly wary of trying to maintain a friendship with someone who holds on to grudges for literal decades.", "So this. It sounds to me like when your sister had kids, she had this little fantasy that you were going to fawn over her and her family, be the unpaid babysitter, and worship at her altar. Then you did your own thing and stayed in Canada, she's stuck doing all the work by herself, and wow, is she ever pissed about it. She hates her life and is jealous of yours, and she's 100% taking it out on you.  \n\n\nKeep doing you. Your sister made her choices and if she's unhappy with them that's a her problem, not a you problem. After that little rant, she can be salty all by herself - and that includes staying home.", "Well... it depends. I am french and you can still have \"traditional\" couple (and strangely, the ones who wants to keep it that way are always the same --\"). And some part of France have their own traditions (and we also love to despise Parisians for many reasons.)\n\nI know we, french, love to debate in our own way (\\^\\^\") but here, the sister is obviously jealous of OP's success and keeping tabs like this... that woman is crazy.", "I'm french too; My sister is super verbally abusive to me since i was in elementary school and let me tell you that even recently if i ask her to clean the shared bathroom (for once in months, cause i always do it) she mentions the time she was like 5 and I was 2 and she had to clean my bedroom because our parents asked her to, so I'm not surprised that OP's sister could talk about memories that much old.", "NTA. Sounds like she's been resentful of you for a while now", "NTA. Wow. She sounds like a horrific and border-line unbalanced person. I would actually go NC. Anyone who starts ranting about a 5 year old not wanting to play with her needs to be kept *far away*.", "Oh, fuck her.", "NTA. What a petty mean soulless heifer", "This was hard to read..I\u2019m so sorry \ud83d\ude15 I would be devastated if this happened\u2026and I truly believe no one deserves this type of criticism in the amount she gave.

Tell her that you\u2019re not an obedient character in her story but her sister.  \n\nHer reaction will tell you everything you need to know", "Wow it sounds like your sister has been angry and envious of you for a while.  I\u2019m sorry, of course you are hurt.  You can thank your sister for being candid with you, and explain you need a break to think about all the things she said to you, and you need some time and it\u2019s better you don\u2019t talk for a while.  NTA.  You are not an a- hole for taking time to process this.", "Lots of the comments have said it well. NTA. And protect yourself. She is not a person to be trusted or someone you can allow yourself to be close to.", "Sounds like my mom and aunt. Unfortunately my mom is a narcissist and has to blame someone for all her problems. Seems like OPS sister is unhappy with life and is jealous of OP.\n\nOP is NTA, and should listen when people tell her who they really are.", "Thank you for this comment. I recognized my situation in yours and your short analysis on this is helpful. I actually don't see her trying to heal this relationship at all!", "My parents were as surprised as I was, but they didn't want to say anything to my sister. They don't want to jeopardize their relationship with her and therefore their grandchildren, which I understand!", "She was in therapy in early 2021 for a short period of time (it was supposed to be finished). I believe this therapy woke something up in her but never gave her the tools to accept the past and/or focus on the positive side of things. After talking about it with my parents I learned she has not been very nice to them these past months either and made hurtful remarks to them too. I do believe she should go back to therapy.", "Thank you for this. I like the idea of writing to her. In the end I am not sure I want to repair what is broken, since I don't think I would be able to trust her after all that. But I do want to have my nephews in my life. We used to spend time just the three of us each time I visited as well as 1:1 calls so they could update me on what's going on in their lives and I loved those moments, I don't want to lose that.", "I think more likely she saw sister as someone she could have mirror lives with. Have kids around the same age, cousins growing up together, etc. Its a very pretty picture that will never be complete for her. Especially since France is pretty family oriented. \n\nI have family members that seem to have similar attitudes and it\u2019s resulted in similar yeetings of years long petty grudges. It\u2019s BS to be sure, especially since we DO have kids the same age and live close but we don\u2019t behave the same way and so it\u2019s a problem. We aren\u2019t where we were but trying to find footing where people can be comfortable. If we lived in different countries? Nah, no way, moving on.", "I'm glad you learned faster than me... I think my sibling has a lot of resentment towards me (for whatever reason), and despite trying for a few years after that conversation where he exploded, I don't feel like he really wants to make things better. And I have been there for him since then. If I could do it over again, I wish I would have been better at distancing myself and just believing his words instead of hoping he would see that I'm not the bad person he thinks I am just because I have harmless parts of my own life I prefer to live in my own way (like you are with yours, living in Canada for example). Anyways, I wish you the best of luck! And your sister too, to figure out what is bothering her so much.", "Understood! Also, why was my question downvotes?", "That's my guess as well. The sister is lashing out at someone other than the cause of her unhappiness.", "Is that why she was upset at her sister for not making a sandwich for her own husband, who presumably has two hands of his own? I just saw the misogyny there, and assumed she hated her sister's freedom. \n\nBut you've got soem good points.", "No idea, this is a fair question in my opinion!", "I'm thinking narcissist.", ">She spent 2 1/2 hours listing everything that she did not like about me, my behavior, my life choices, my personality. I was sobbing for the most part and unable to answer, but she kept on going, unfazed.\n\nDoes...does your sister have some psychological deficiency? Like, I know I'm on the spectrum so I might miss a norm here or there, but...to me someone doesn't just invite you to their home thousands of miles from where you live and then spend two and a half hours listing every thing they dislike about you, while you cry and they just keep going with no emotion, unless they're some level of psychopath. Like this woman went on for hours listing a laundry list of shit going back to when you were only five, and includes shit that shows a level of self-entitlement that is unhealthy. Like, \"oh no, my sister didn't play with me, how dare she.\"\n\n>She also mentioned that I was way to happy to talk about the promotion I had at work, and to let her know I was no longer struggling financially.\n\nNo really, a loving family member would be happy to know you were thriving, but she resents you for not tailoring your life around hers and being the object lesson on how not to lead your life? Is she bitter that you didn't flounder so she could preen about how good she has it?\n\n>She also said I should not call her that often and should wait for her to authorize me to call (by text). \n\nThis is also ludicrously controlling. Like it sounds like a simple boundary on the surface, but the vast majority of people just call eachother. My mother gets calls from my aunts at random all the time.\n\n>After our conversation she felt much better and stated we could finally start to have a real relationship as sister. One I though we always had...\n\nLike, I think you're completely right to feel fucked over by this situation. She basically dumped 30 years worth of the pettiest and most minor grievances that amounted to, \"you suck because you're not convenient to me at all times, and now that you know this you can do better and I can finally like you.\" Like, I don't care if she's your sister if someone did this to me I'd be like, \"congrats, I don't like you though, so fuck off and suffer.\" I've iced out people for less and that's not me saying I cut people off for small slights. That's me saying what you experience was a **huge one.**\n\n>When I saw her again on my last day, I told her I was really not happy about our conversation, that even though some remarks made sense, some of them were just mean. I finished by letting her know that since she did not seems to like me, she was no longer invited to visit me. She seemed very hurt and has not spoke to me since.\n\nYou should have finished that with, \"now we can finally start to have a real relationship as strangers,\" because I don't see how her not talking to you is a bad thing at this point. Someone who did what she did can stay silent and stay away, because you can't even trust the sincerity of her whether she's saying I love you or, \"I had crepe suzette this morning.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA!\n\nOP, you gave yourself the gift of peace and sanity by keeping such a cruel person away from you.", "NTA. \n\nWow, I'm so sorry that happened to you.", "There\u2019s a lot of work to do here between you, much more than any acronym judgments can express.
