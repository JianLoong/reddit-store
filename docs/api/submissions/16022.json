I'm french and I have been living in Canada for the last 6 years. I go back to my country almost every year to visit them. I have always thought my sister and I had a great relationship, she was the first person I wanted to see, the most important person in my life. We used to text and facetime several times a week. \n\nLast August, I arrived at my sister's to spend 4 days with her and my nephews. 1 hour after I arrived she started complaining about my behavior during my last visit, she was not happy that I did not made her husband's lunch one day. I voiced my surprise that she kept her feelings toward this for a year. She apparently wanted to tell me in person.\nDuring the rest of my stay she made me feel not welcomed in her home and made excuses to come home very late. I was hurt by this, but stayed because I wanted to spend time with my nephews. On the 3rd night I wanted to talked it out with her because I sensed it was deeper than the husband's lunch.\n\nShe spent 2 1/2 hours listing everything that she did not like about me, my behavior, my life choices, my personality. I was sobbing for the most part and unable to answer, but she kept on going, unfazed. Her list was going back to when I was 5 and refused to play with her (I ve always been a loner), to our teenage years and the fact she chose to go to school so far that she was only back on the weekends, meaning that she did not think we were sisters then. Same when we went to the same university and saw each other almost everyday, she stated that we were friends during that time, not sisters. Later in life, she asked me to officiate her wedding ceremony and to be the godmother of one of my nephew. I sense that she is very disappointed that I decided to stay in Canada and I believe that she started resenting me when she realized I was not coming back to France. She also mentioned that I was way to happy to talk about the promotion I had at work, and to let her know I was no longer struggling financially. She also said I should not call her that often and should wait for her to authorize me to call (by text). She basically went through every aspects of my life in a negative way.\n\nAfter our conversation she felt much better and stated we could finally start to have a real relationship as sister. One I though we always had...\n\nI felt as if our relationship was a lie. I spent the rest of my vacation being sad, but also angry that she did not talked to me sooner but chose to do it during my only vacation of the year.\n\nWhen I saw her again on my last day, I told her I was really not happy about our conversation, that even though some remarks made sense, some of them were just mean. I finished by letting her know that since she did not seems to like me, she was no longer invited to visit me. She seemed very hurt and has not spoke to me since.\n\nAITA for canceling the invitation ?", "created_utc": 1682823202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133e1qc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_no_longer/", "score": 252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sorry she treated you that way.", "NTA", "NTA-I know a lot of family grows apart, but from what you wrote, you felt like you were close. Obviously don\u2019t know her or you but she maybe could be a bit jealous that you have this life away, a different life while she is living more of a familial life, with a husband and kids. The list and things that happened as kids, husband\u2019s sandwich is all too weird for a sisterly relationship.", "NTA what the f is her problem, still mad that 32 years ago when she was 7 her 5-year-old sister would not play with her?  2 1/2 hours of belittling you. She is upset that you are finally financially stable? You cannot call her until she texts you saying it is ok.  Make sure that she, Mr. you did not make my lunch are not welcome in your home and if the show up in Canada you will not see them.", "NTA- your sister is jealous of you and your life \n\nShe expects you to wait on her husband just because she has to. \n\nAnd seeing you financially successful in your career is too much for her to bear so she had to put you down to make herself feel better .\n\nThe whole bringing up grievance from where you were 5 is just her trying to justify her own petty little feelings .\n\nI\u2019m sorry your relationship with your nephews has to suffer but  your sister is wrong and don\u2019t let her back in til she sincerely apologizes.", "NTA and it makes total sense that if you make her that unhappy, she wouldn't want to come see you anyway. \n\nI'm sorry the whole relationship seems to have been a lie, but at least you know now and can focus on spending time with people who like you.\n\nI will just add that this seems to be about your sister, not you; jealousy, hurt you're for away, guilt over something- all can manifest in unjustified anger.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry she did that to you. It wasn\u2019t ok. You very much are NTA to put up a boundary and not allow that to potentially (probably?) happen again.", "^^ This. She was totally enjoying making you cry. What a piece of work. You are definitely NTA. I'd go full NC. You do not need that level of toxic in your life.", "I mean, it\u2019s been over a year. He must be STARVING!", "That\u2019s why she\u2019s so mad\n\nHe died of acute sandwich deprivation", "NTA.  Why do I get the feeling that sisters\u2019s life is shit and because OPs is not, that she decided to take it all out on OP?", "NTAH- she spewed every petty resentment going back years and honestly- it sounds more like she is jealous of the choices you have made and the life you\u2019ve built. \nInvite someone who wants to come, enjoys your company and wants to see/celebrate your accomplishments rather than berate you", "NTA.  She sounds mean. Just a mean person.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  It's going to take you a while to recover from what your sister did to you.  \n\nAs for your relationship with your sister, that may never recover.  You need to go LC and take care of yourself.\n\nI hope you have a good support network in Canada.\n\nYou've gone back to France every year - it's time to spend your holidays seeing your adopted country.  There's much to see.", "NTA at all. It sounds like your sister has some underlying issues. You're probably right in your assessment that your relationship was a bit of a lie. I'm American, so I'm not sure if it's a cultural custom, but why are you expected to make lunch for her husband? It seems so juvenile and petty on her part. You made the right decision to uninvite her after she blatantly disrespected you. It's your life, not hers. She can't expect to have a relationship with you as a sister just on her terms. You're definitely NTA, but your sister is. Best of luck.", "How old is she, 10? You deserve better.", "NTA, she is poison and to keep living the life you do, take the \u201cantidote\u201d and cut her off.", "NTA. Ngl she should feel awful for what she put you through on your vacation. That was just downright cruel. You did the right thing by uninviting her. Sounds like you both need the space.", "NTA.\nShe sounds awful. Go No Contact for your sanity.", "NTA and I\u2019m concerned for your sister. Is the behaviour out of character for her? You described having a close relationship with her previously\u2026\n\nI have a sister with a similar age gap and if we had this sort of exchange I would respond in the same way as you but I would also be worried as to the cause of this outburst.\n\nBy all means give her some distance as she has been very rude to you but is there another family member who could act as mediator to check on her and explore if something more sinister is going on?", "NTA.\n\nShe went all the way back to what she didn't like about you from age five years old all the way to now to let you know she's upset about how well you're doing financially. She doesn't sound like she needs to be in your home. Ever. It's just going to fuel another emotional dump on you when she sees your home and experiences your new life.\n\nIf you forgive her, keep it low contact. Facetime, texts, and an occasional phone call when she allows. {insert eye roll here}\n\nIf you ever go visit her again, get a hotel room. That'll solve her desire to have you as a servant.", "No, you were sad and hurt and it was understandable after how she attacked you and unloaded. NTA but you need to decide if you want to try to make forward and make new happy sister memories or if you are done with that being the last interaction for awhile", "Sounds like you two are half way there! You need at least one more 2 1/2 hour session to talk it out.", "[removed]", "What did the rest of the family say about this?", "NTA your sister went nuclear on you and then expected you to be fine the next day. No, that's incredibly narcissistic and in no way realistic. You blew up every interaction and emotion from age 5 on, none of it was real. You were having a relationship with yourself. Best to let it go, cause who knows 1. If it won't happen again. 2. Who really is this person claiming sisterhood? After so many years of lies.", "NTA omg..what's wrong with your sister.. Authorize to call her..if she has small kids maybe at night before calling you can text her so don't disturb kids sleep.but other than that it's absurd.", "NTA \n\nshe sounds narcissistic in the true sense.\n\nLook up you tube videos by Dr ramani if you may be curious\n.\n\nShe totally ransacked you with a million faults and crimes...\n\nUnreasonable.  You sound genuinely confused and in dismay.\n\nSorry for your side of that 'transaction'.", " Make her husband's lunch? I'm guessing marriage and kids was a requirement. OP got out, sis didn't and got stuck in life that she hates. Pure envy, it sounds like.\n\n\nOP, you're NTA. Waiting to call until you get permission? That's bullshit. It would be understandable if she had said to SMS so as not to wake the kids and she'll call you back when she's free or something like that, but what she's proposing is ridiculous.", "So...what, people are not allowed to live in another country?
