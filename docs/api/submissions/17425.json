The only person who was available to transport me (my oral surgeon requires someone to be with me during the surgery to take me home) was my dad. I am in my late 20s and do not have a good relationship with my dad at all, but I don't really have friends that I feel comfortable with asking and my dad is available and retired so that was really my only choice. He made a big deal out of having to take me and waiting during the surgery, even to the staff at the oral surgeon's office.\n\nAfter I was done, I was very nauseous and loopy. The oral surgeon's office is about 30 mins from where I live. As we are getting closer to my apartment, my dad makes a detour. I ask him where he is going and he says that he is going to the brewery to have a few beers. I ask him if he can please drop me off at my apartment as I am not feeling good. He begins yelling at me that he had to take time out of his day to be there for my surgery, had to wait a long time and that he can have a few beers to relax and that it's rude of me to be ordering him around. I tell him that I feel like I am going to throw up and that my apartment is literally only 5-6 miles from the bar he is going to and that I would even pay him for gas. He gets pissed off and says that it's not even going to take him that long to have 1-2 beers and that I stressed him out today and for me to shut up and stop making a huge deal out of it. He then starts asking me why didn't I have the money to call for an Uber and why don't I have a husband, boyfriend or friends who are willing to take care of me and called me a loser, and that if I lost weight and took better care of myself maybe I would have a boyfriend or friends. He then said that because he is driving, that doesn't automatically make him my chauffer and that if I don't feel like going to the brewery with him, then I can walk home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. I walked home. It took me over an hour and I had to stop 3 times to throw up on the side of the road.

I want to specifically address the terrible things your father said about you. I was a fat woman in my late twenties when I had to have someone drive me home from dental work, and I didn't have many friends where I was. I was able to ask someone I'd befriended at work, and she was happy to do it and even stayed with me after I got home and slept. So that part worked out okay, but I didn't feel super great about the other parts of my life, and I did kinda feel like a loser.\n\nBut the thing is, none of those factors said anything about who I am as a person. Ten years later, I'm still fat, but I like my life a lot better. My weight didn't keep boyfriends away, because I realized I was asexual and didn't want one. I also followed my hobbies and made some really great friends along the way. Most of them live in other places, but Internet friends can still be great friends, and they gave me reasons to travel where they live. And as a shy introvert, I learned that the thing about making friends is to find people you might like and just act kinda like they're already your friend in a casual way. Reply to them a few times on social media, for example. Ask to grab lunch if they're local. You'll figure out if they're friend material or if they're not interested. And yes, this is an open invitation to DM me and chat if you want!", "[removed]", "NTA. I'm a father and behaving like that towards your child is absolutely disgusting. Your dad is the asshole here and I'd probably go no contact with him, he sounds very abusive.", "Hey OP please take the opportunity to share as much of this story as you feel comfortable divulging with your closest friends. I\u2019ll bet there might be one or two who would offer to help out if something similar happens in future. I have been that person for a friend; she had to wait a bit because I had to leave work to collect her but she was totally fine with that. Totally NTA and my sympathy for how you were treated.", "NTA. You have an abusive, alcoholic father who has skewed your view of reality to the point that you are here asking if being abused makes YOU an asshole. I\u2019m so sorry you have had to endure this, OP, and please know that his behavior \u2014 the behavior of all abusive, addicted, or empathy-less people in your life \u2014 is not okay or normal. It\u2019s not. \n\nA healthy parent-child relationship would look like this: he would be happy you came to him for help, and would not only wait without complaint, but would insist on staying with you during and after the procedure. His support wouldn\u2019t even be a question in your mind. It would just be there. He would never, EVER make you feel a particle of guilt for it and would be reassuring you that he\u2019s happy to be helping and protecting his kid, because that\u2019s what dads do. He would never, ever cal, you a burden or so much as think of going drinking under these circumstances.\n\nHis behavior in this situation is so far removed from a normal, healthy reality that it\u2019s inconceivable to anyone who has had a semi-normal parent-kid relationship. Please seek therapy and start cutting this person out of your life. You are NOT a burden. Period. You deserve to be helped. You are worthy of help. You deserve to be loved, supported, and cared for. I want you to learn how to believe that, because this breaks my heart.", "NTA\n\nAs a father myself, I'm sorry your dad's an ass. I really am. For your own sake, pls dont ask him any favors anymore.

It may not be able to happen soon, but you need to move hundreds or more miles from him. He is toxic to your personal growth with the things he says,", "NTA at all. I seriously hope this is some creative writing exercise because I wouldn\u2019t wish anyone to go through that experience, but if it isn\u2019t then I\u2019m so sorry for what you had to go through. Complaining that you\u2019re inconveniencing him is bad enough, most parents would have no issue supporting their child through what is an obviously horrible situation. I don\u2019t get along with my mum particularly but if I asked her to support me with something as major as surgery she\u2019d do it without complaint. \n\nThen, when you\u2019re still under the anaesthetic and not in the best mind state, he berates you and insults you, calling you overweight and saying that you can\u2019t get a partner because of it and because you can\u2019t take care of yourself. I have no clue what is wrong with this man but he is not a nice person and an even worse dad. Being caring and wanting to protect and nurture your child is what\u2019s normal and natural, getting angry and not putting your well-being above his want of a couple of beers is not normal. He took advantage of your situation because he is slightly inconvenienced (in his opinion anyway, you should be his priority) and even let you walk home, it makes me so angry just thinking about it. I\u2019m so very sorry you have this person as a parent, I would completely cut contact with him if I was in your position. \n\nI wish you a speedy recovery and I\u2019m sorry this guy (he\u2019s certainly not a man or worthy of being called a dad) treated you so disgustingly. Having him in your life cannot be good for your mental health so I hope you can work out what to do that\u2019s best for you. As others have pointed out, surgeons often want a parent as if something goes wrong it can be a life or death decision that needs to be made. I would never have him be the one to make any decisions, as he clearly doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart. You deserve better and you can have better, you don\u2019t need to change anything you don\u2019t want to change for yourself so don\u2019t listen to anything he\u2019s said.", ">do not have a good relationship with my dad at all\n\nHmmm, I wonder why?

Jesus.", "NTA\nText your dad back and tell him this is the last communication you will ever have and goodbye.", "NTA - You should have called for a taxi.", "NTA. Your dad is horrible and abusive. I know it's easy to say go NC with him. But I don't know what support systems you have. Please reflect on this, so that you can permanently cut ties with him.", "NTA. I had dental surgery where I was sedated in my 20s. My dad drove me there, waited for me, and then drove me back home (i think he might have stayed with me until i \"sobered up.\" He didn't once make me feel like a burden, and thought that my woozy chit-chat hilarious (i got him back by finding his morphine garbled chit char hilarious after he had surgery a few years ago). That's what a decent person does. Your dad is a massive (abusive) AH. Not you. \n\nIt also concerns me that he wanted to get beers and then drive you home. Oh, and that he happily let someone who was recovering from sedation *walk home*. Both are dangerous.", "NTA... I am so sorry your dad is an AH. An uber would not be enough for the dentist to allow you to have the procedure.... they were under the impression that you were under someone's care. \nHope you feel better soon.", "NTA your father is a monster! You didn\u2019t deserve any of that!", "My dear, my mate, my pal... throw that man out of your life asap. Seriously.\n\nI've had that kind of oral surgery before. If my bf hadn't basically carried me home afterwards I would have ended up just confusedly wandering the streets for quite a while.\n\nYou asked him to do a simple thing: Get you to the surgery, get you through the surgery, get you home.\n\nThose three tasks were too much - and mind you, he was *driving* but insisted on getting booze.\n\nLet that part sink in. The guy has a drinking problem if he goes this irate over not having access to booze for a few hours.\n\n\nNext time dare to bother someone who'll actually end up doing what they signed up to do. Trust me, I'd rather drive around a loose acquaintance than have them deal with someone like your dad and you bet I'm not the only one.\n\n\nNTA duh", "What a pig. Please go NC with him, love. What the actual. You are NTA.", "NTA. Your dad is a wanker.", "NTA. However I would stop relying on him, he's a massive knob cheese. Time to grey rock him and go NC.", "NTA. Sounds like your dad could be an alcoholic. Maybe look into alanon.", "I think you already know the answer to this.\n\nDrop him like a hot potato; I don\u2019t care what people say, sometimes parents need to be cut out.", "NTA by any means. Your father is horrible and his attitude atrocious.  Glad you finally made it home. Sorry you didn't puke in your dad's car, preferably on him first. Block and forget about him.", "NTA, I'm sorry you have a terrible father, might be time to cut off ties", "NTA", "NTA but you should\u2019ve thrown up in his car first", "Nta. If your dad prioritized alcohol over your well-being, he has a problem with alcohol", "What a disgusting person! I really wish I could give OP a big hug. OP you did nothing wrong, your father however is a real piece of work. I'd definitely cut ties with him and move on with your life. I'm sure you'll be much happier", "NTA. For context, my coworker who was new to the country needed major oral surgery. Our manager let me take the afternoon off on the proviso that I meet her at the clinic, wait while she was in there, drive to get prescriptions and make sure she had supplies and was safe at home. About 8 hours all up. I\u2019d known this lady 4 months\u2026 your dads a D and I\u2019d be cutting contact.", "NTA", "What a disgusting man. I am sorry you have this person as a relation. He is despicable and I hope he dies screaming. NTA.", "NTA obviously\n\nWhen i had to drive my husband to and from the hospital, they made me sign a form that i understood his needs and that i will take him home safely! I would have faced legal consequences if i did what your dad did. (Not that i would do something like that)\n\nAsk your surgeon or the staff at the hospital, if he had to sign something. There is a reason why they want someone to drive you!\n\nPlease stay safe and NEVER trist him again.", "Hey uh. This ypur sign to go no contact. Ive gone no contact with both my parents and they would be shocked to hear how your dad treated you.", "NTA\n\nTime to go no contact.\n\nI just can't imagine ever treating my kids like this. Your father's behaviour was just vile.", "Block your father, you don't deserve to be treated like that", "NTA - I\u2019d build a support group and cut him off. That\u2019s not a father.", "NTA.  The man sounds bit entitled and self-absorbed.  He's retired - what is he unwinding FROM?", "NTA - I'm so sorry you had to go through that and have your own parent treat you in such an abusive manner. Your father was 100% TA, and like others have said I would go no contact with him, too. You were in a vulnerable situation and legit didn't feel well, and for him to be ok with you walking home alone after being under anesthesia is disgusting and reveals how bad of a father he is.", "He\u2019s an alcoholic if I had to guess (backed up by a great deal of experience) I expect he was past his drinking start time and possibly suffering some withdrawal.  There is no other reason I can come up with that would make someone think \u201cI need to go to the bar immediately and don\u2019t give a shit that you had surgery\u201d.", "I had a similar thing happen. Spent most of the night in the ER with a burst ovarian cyst, basically just being monitored to make sure I don't pass out from blood loss. My sister insisted on coming with me and we took a cab there. Around 4:30 I'm released and she doesn't have enough money for a cab home, and I have no money at all. Instead of waiting 2 hours for the busses to start running she makes me walk the 5km home. 2 days later she casually drops that a nurse told her (and not me for some reason?) Not to let me do any physical activity because of the blood loss. \n\nIt took me years to realize how abusive that was because my normal meter is so fucked up.", "I had to have my partner take me home after my wisdom tooth removal last month, I don\u2019t have any memory of the surgery and passed out twice while there. The drugs they give you are no joke.", "In Australia,  Silver Chain will do this for you. \nThey also have nurses that will come out to your home post surgery to change dressings and check on wounds, etc. \nMy husband got an infection that needed surgery, and they came out every day for a week to redress the wound and then showed me how to care for him.", "Nta, it\u2019s time for no contact. Don\u2019t let people speak to you like that. You did nothing wrong. I hope you\u2019re feeling better now!", "NTA. Your dad is an abusive alcoholic. Time to cut contact.", "NTA.  As much as I had a strained relationship with my father, he would have never done that to me.  Your father is so horrible to you.  Do not depend on him anymore.  If he tries to contact you later in life to take care of him, tell him to F off.", "NTA. Next time (hopefully won\u2019t be a next time) you just call someone else and pay for the gas so you don\u2019t feel like a burden and can avoid that failure of a father that you got.", "NTA. He sounds horrible and abusive and I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. He also should never be drinking and driving. I hope your surgery went well and you\u2019re feeling better now. Don\u2019t be afraid to go no contact with him.", "[removed]", "NTA. Even aside from the fact you'd just had surgery, he was planning to drink and drive?! Not acceptable.", "Omfg. Your father is abusive. You need to protect yourself. I'm so sorry he did that to you. I also didn't have anyone to help me get home after emergency oral surgery and it was scary and likely unsafe of me to have been alone- but for someone to take advantage of you in that moment is despicable. You are NTA at all.", "Sounds like a good reason to go NC.", "This is really messed up! You're in no way, shape or form an AH. I'm sorry you've been saddled with such an ass of a father.", "Jeezus\u2026do you really have to ask??? Of course you\u2019re NTA!", "You're dad is Frank Gallagher from Shameless, and I am so sorry for that.\n\nThe only way any of his kids ended up better was by cutting him off. He's a drunken ass who only cares about himself.\n\nYou should follow their example and go full NC. You can't trust a man who *makes you walk home after surgery because he wants beer.*\n\nTo emphasize - ***He made you walk home after a surgical procedure because he wanted to drink.***\n\nI hope you're able to find someone who makes you feel better about yourself and supports you.\n\nNTA", "Abusive behaviour (I did something for you, now I\u2019m going to use the fact that you NEED ME against you) NTA I\u2019d cut contact.", "NTA - hope you feel better after your surgery.\n\nYour \u201cdad\u201d is disgusting, I hope you go no contact with him, he seems toxic", "NTA.\n\nI'm horrified for you. Please cut this monster out of your life.", "Why is it so easy for a parent to hate his kid so much?", "Fuck him. He can go rot at the brewery.", "NTA - also....driving to a brewery to drink a couple beers before driving home?! Am I reading that right?", "NC definitely called for here. NTA", "NTA - I am sorry for you! Your Dad was mean and if I was you, I'd try to avoid contact with him in the future. I wish yiu the best :)", "NTA. I\u2019m so very sorry that he mistreated you! I\u2019m so sorry that you didn\u2019t have anyone else to ask. Please do whatever you can to make at least one friend who can help you when you need it. Your Dad should not be in your life if this is how he treats you. He has issues that you cannot help him correct.", "NTA. Was he verbally abusive to you before? Because that\u2019s what it was- verbal abuse. And he wanted to punish you by having you sit in a bar while you\u2019re sick. Time to cut dad off. Good luck and f him", "NTA. I\u2019d go no contact with him, that\u2019s abusive.", "Good god. This is horrible. NTA. You deserve better than this, OP. Sending virtual hugs.", "NTA and honestly, please go NC. You say you don\u2019t have a good relationship with him anyway, but this was unforgivable. This is so abusive and controlling - waiting until you\u2019re in a vulnerable position to then torment you by making you wait a few hours for him whilst feeling unwell, as \u2018punishment\u2019 for him having to wait for you. \n\nI would really encourage you to consider whether there is any reason to *not* go NC - the fact you even have to ask AITA here suggests his abuse and controlling behaviour has had a big impact on you. If you don\u2019t, please never rely on him again. Call someone else - anyone else.", "First\n\nHave a proper dad-hug.  You made the best decision you could out of a set of difficult options.  I'm proud of you.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA your dad doesn\u2019t care about your well-being", "NTA. He is obviously an alcoholic (so was my distant father) who's alcohol means more to them than anything else.", "Should have waited in the car and called the cops to report a DUI in progress when came back to the car.

Your father (if that's what you want to call the sperm donor) is a selfish prick.  Cut that jerk out of your life completely.  He obviously was never a dad or father.", "Don't forget that he pretty much planned on OP walking or taking them home with alcohol in his system", "i felt my blood go cold reading this because my dad did this EXACT THING to me after oral surgery, and on the way he stopped by taco bell for himself and his friends and joked about how it was too bad i was going to have to smell food i couldn\u2019t eat, and i made him drop me off on the side of the road too. he barely stopped long enough for me to get out and i fell over in my driveway. i\u2019d blocked it out until i read this but he\u2019s been giving me problems for going LC with him lately and that memory will probably help", "Nah", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He wants a life lesson about being a drunk.", "It\u2019s 100% this. My FIL gets tetchy if he hasn\u2019t had a drink shortly after lunch. When he lived a 3 hour drive away he\u2019d sometimes turn up earlier than we expected so as to arrive before beer o\u2019clock and be drinking on our verandah when we got home.

I\u2019ve been in surgery several times. It\u2019s definitely always been specified \u201cfamily members\u201d in paperwork. Maybe that differs between hospitals. If the patient has no family who can do it, you can have a friend or medical transport company take you, but the hospital will make you sign a stack of waivers and I don\u2019t know what else because they don\u2019t want the liability of someone not taking good care of you.", "OP wasn't safe though. Would've been better off with a taxi driver.\nWhen my mother had surgery they didn't let her out until she was lucid, and then she could take a taxi. They did ask if she had someone at home to help.
