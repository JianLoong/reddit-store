The only person who was available to transport me (my oral surgeon requires someone to be with me during the surgery to take me home) was my dad. I am in my late 20s and do not have a good relationship with my dad at all, but I don't really have friends that I feel comfortable with asking and my dad is available and retired so that was really my only choice. He made a big deal out of having to take me and waiting during the surgery, even to the staff at the oral surgeon's office.\n\nAfter I was done, I was very nauseous and loopy. The oral surgeon's office is about 30 mins from where I live. As we are getting closer to my apartment, my dad makes a detour. I ask him where he is going and he says that he is going to the brewery to have a few beers. I ask him if he can please drop me off at my apartment as I am not feeling good. He begins yelling at me that he had to take time out of his day to be there for my surgery, had to wait a long time and that he can have a few beers to relax and that it's rude of me to be ordering him around. I tell him that I feel like I am going to throw up and that my apartment is literally only 5-6 miles from the bar he is going to and that I would even pay him for gas. He gets pissed off and says that it's not even going to take him that long to have 1-2 beers and that I stressed him out today and for me to shut up and stop making a huge deal out of it. He then starts asking me why didn't I have the money to call for an Uber and why don't I have a husband, boyfriend or friends who are willing to take care of me and called me a loser, and that if I lost weight and took better care of myself maybe I would have a boyfriend or friends. He then said that because he is driving, that doesn't automatically make him my chauffer and that if I don't feel like going to the brewery with him, then I can walk home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. I walked home. It took me over an hour and I had to stop 3 times to throw up on the side of the road.

Even if you hadn\u2019t just had surgery, the things he said were absolutely not ok.\n\nRemove him from your life permanently. (Just to be clear, I\u2019m not talking about un-aliving him) Go no contact and work on yourself.  I\u2019m betting that he has been emotionally abusing you for years, so find a therapist that you feel comfortable talking to.\n\nI wish you well, and please know that you are not what your dad said that you are!  He is obviously a miserable little man, so consider the source.", "NTA you may consider completely cutting him out of your life. He treated you really terribly and you deserve way better.", "Oh honey I\u2019m sorry. Obviously you\u2019re NTA. Your dad is a freaking monster and I hope you never speak to him again for the rest of his wretched life.", "NTA. Your dad needs to be punched in the nut sack. Parenting is forever. That means you drop your adult child at home before you go day drinking if you can\u2019t muster up the ability to stay with them and make sure they are ok. Hope his beer was over priced and stale.", "I mean, you posted this here so I am obliged to comment with NTA. But the real response here is WTF.", "Your father is an asshole.   No one who loves you does this.", "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even asking the question.  Of course you\u2019re NTA.  Of course you\u2019re not.  I get that you said you weren\u2019t comfortable asking someone else, but honestly you would have been better off getting a ride from a total stranger.  Jeez.  What a tool your father is.", "NTA. But your dad sounds like an alcoholic.", "NTA. I am so sorry this happened to you. If he was not such a crappy parent and a huge AH, he would have taken you home straight from dentist office. Remember that line about being a burden when he needs help. There is a medical transport service in my area people can call for a ride. Not everyone has family or friends to help.", "NTA of course, and you should block this monster from the rest of your life.", "Woooooow! You are sooooo NTA! Wtf?! I wouldn't be surprised if you went NC. He called you names and refused to drop you home after surgery? Far out", "If I were you, your father wouldn't be alive anymore. I'd kick his shit in if he said that to me.", "Hi OP, I hope you clearly see from these comments that you are NTA and that your father is not a good person. I want to specifically address the terrible things your father said about you. I was a fat woman in my late twenties when I had to have someone drive me home from dental work, and I didn't have many friends where I was. I was able to ask someone I'd befriended at work, and she was happy to do it and even stayed with me after I got home and slept. So that part worked out okay, but I didn't feel super great about the other parts of my life, and I did kinda feel like a loser.\n\nBut the thing is, none of those factors said anything about who I am as a person. Ten years later, I'm still fat, but I like my life a lot better. My weight didn't keep boyfriends away, because I realized I was asexual and didn't want one. I also followed my hobbies and made some really great friends along the way. Most of them live in other places, but Internet friends can still be great friends, and they gave me reasons to travel where they live. And as a shy introvert, I learned that the thing about making friends is to find people you might like and just act kinda like they're already your friend in a casual way. Reply to them a few times on social media, for example. Ask to grab lunch if they're local. You'll figure out if they're friend material or if they're not interested. And yes, this is an open invitation to DM me and chat if you want!", "[removed]", "NTA. I'm a father and behaving like that towards your child is absolutely disgusting. Your dad is the asshole here and I'd probably go no contact with him, he sounds very abusive.", "Hey OP please take the opportunity to share as much of this story as you feel comfortable divulging with your closest friends. I\u2019ll bet there might be one or two who would offer to help out if something similar happens in future. I have been that person for a friend; she had to wait a bit because I had to leave work to collect her but she was totally fine with that. Totally NTA and my sympathy for how you were treated.", "NTA. You have an abusive, alcoholic father who has skewed your view of reality to the point that you are here asking if being abused makes YOU an asshole. I\u2019m so sorry you have had to endure this, OP, and please know that his behavior \u2014 the behavior of all abusive, addicted, or empathy-less people in your life \u2014 is not okay or normal. It\u2019s not. \n\nA healthy parent-child relationship would look like this: he would be happy you came to him for help, and would not only wait without complaint, but would insist on staying with you during and after the procedure. His support wouldn\u2019t even be a question in your mind. It would just be there. He would never, EVER make you feel a particle of guilt for it and would be reassuring you that he\u2019s happy to be helping and protecting his kid, because that\u2019s what dads do. He would never, ever cal, you a burden or so much as think of going drinking under these circumstances.\n\nHis behavior in this situation is so far removed from a normal, healthy reality that it\u2019s inconceivable to anyone who has had a semi-normal parent-kid relationship. Please seek therapy and start cutting this person out of your life. You are NOT a burden. Period. You deserve to be helped. You are worthy of help. You deserve to be loved, supported, and cared for. I want you to learn how to believe that, because this breaks my heart.", "NTA\n\nAs a father myself, I'm sorry your dad's an ass. I really am. For your own sake, pls dont ask him any favors anymore. His face is so far up his own butt to be of much help to anyone. A stranger would probably be better at this point.", "Your father is an emotional abuser. It may not be able to happen soon, but you need to move hundreds or more miles from him. He is toxic to your personal growth with the things he says,", "NTA at all. I seriously hope this is some creative writing exercise because I wouldn\u2019t wish anyone to go through that experience, but if it isn\u2019t then I\u2019m so sorry for what you had to go through. Complaining that you\u2019re inconveniencing him is bad enough, most parents would have no issue supporting their child through what is an obviously horrible situation. I don\u2019t get along with my mum particularly but if I asked her to support me with something as major as surgery she\u2019d do it without complaint. \n\nThen, when you\u2019re still under the anaesthetic and not in the best mind state, he berates you and insults you, calling you overweight and saying that you can\u2019t get a partner because of it and because you can\u2019t take care of yourself. I have no clue what is wrong with this man but he is not a nice person and an even worse dad. Being caring and wanting to protect and nurture your child is what\u2019s normal and natural, getting angry and not putting your well-being above his want of a couple of beers is not normal. He took advantage of your situation because he is slightly inconvenienced (in his opinion anyway, you should be his priority) and even let you walk home, it makes me so angry just thinking about it. I\u2019m so very sorry you have this person as a parent, I would completely cut contact with him if I was in your position. \n\nI wish you a speedy recovery and I\u2019m sorry this guy (he\u2019s certainly not a man or worthy of being called a dad) treated you so disgustingly. Having him in your life cannot be good for your mental health so I hope you can work out what to do that\u2019s best for you. As others have pointed out, surgeons often want a parent as if something goes wrong it can be a life or death decision that needs to be made. I would never have him be the one to make any decisions, as he clearly doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart. You deserve better and you can have better, you don\u2019t need to change anything you don\u2019t want to change for yourself so don\u2019t listen to anything he\u2019s said.", ">do not have a good relationship with my dad at all\n\nHmmm, I wonder why? NTA.", "Sorrry dad. A reputable doc who gives you sedation isn\u2019t going to let you call an Uber.", "NTA -  Your dad is a real prick.  I'm sure the oral surgeon would have suggested you go straight home and rest.  He probably didn't think he had to tell you that, because any moron would know.  I'm sorry you had such a bad day, and I'm glad you made it home safely.", "He's an alcoholic. Go no contact and stay away forever.", "I'd personally never engage with him again.....  That's unforgivable.", "[removed]", "My dad was a verbally and emotionally abusive alcoholic. This story rings true to me, unfortunately.", "This is real.
