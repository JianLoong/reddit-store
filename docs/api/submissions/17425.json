The only person who was available to transport me (my oral surgeon requires someone to be with me during the surgery to take me home) was my dad. I am in my late 20s and do not have a good relationship with my dad at all, but I don't really have friends that I feel comfortable with asking and my dad is available and retired so that was really my only choice. He made a big deal out of having to take me and waiting during the surgery, even to the staff at the oral surgeon's office.\n\nAfter I was done, I was very nauseous and loopy. The oral surgeon's office is about 30 mins from where I live. As we are getting closer to my apartment, my dad makes a detour. I ask him where he is going and he says that he is going to the brewery to have a few beers. I ask him if he can please drop me off at my apartment as I am not feeling good. He begins yelling at me that he had to take time out of his day to be there for my surgery, had to wait a long time and that he can have a few beers to relax and that it's rude of me to be ordering him around. I tell him that I feel like I am going to throw up and that my apartment is literally only 5-6 miles from the bar he is going to and that I would even pay him for gas. He gets pissed off and says that it's not even going to take him that long to have 1-2 beers and that I stressed him out today and for me to shut up and stop making a huge deal out of it. He then starts asking me why didn't I have the money to call for an Uber and why don't I have a husband, boyfriend or friends who are willing to take care of me and called me a loser, and that if I lost weight and took better care of myself maybe I would have a boyfriend or friends. He then said that because he is driving, that doesn't automatically make him my chauffer and that if I don't feel like going to the brewery with him, then I can walk home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. I walked home. It took me over an hour and I had to stop 3 times to throw up on the side of the road. And then I got several text messages calling me rude for trying to tell him what to do and that this is the last time he is helping me with anything and called me a burden. I feel bad for even asking him for help.
