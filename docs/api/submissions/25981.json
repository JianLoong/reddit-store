She is being incredibly selfish and you and your kids deserve better than this.", "Sounds like my husband's ex.  She wanted to party, but had three kids - that she wanted, then neglected and abused.\nDivorce her, let her be the party animal, do you want your daughter seeing mummys revolving bedroom door?  Get the children out, it's not going to get any better.  At least give them a decent life.  That's what my husband did.  I helped his raise his two teenaged daughters.", "NTA. Go to couples therapy, but honestly she has checked out and she is dead weight at this point. Better to split up.", "Mmmmmmmm!", "They're also swingers. So I'm guessing when he says \"the cheating stopped\" they actually just started swinging instead.\n\nOP She might indeed be a terrible Mom but you probably should have just gotten divorced instead of whatever it is you have going on now. You obviously don't like your wife at all anymore and I don't know why you keep her around to keep disappointing your children.
