Rude low class behavior on top of it.", "NTA. Changing a full diaper at a dining table is unhygienic and rude to everyone else in the restaurant.

Who changes a poopy diaper on the table or a restaurant when there are other options available (change table,I\u2019ve also used my car). \n\nOnce I did have to change in a restaurant with no change table. It was attached to an arena and we were there for an event with no in/out privileges.  There was no change table, I couldn\u2019t go out to my car and we couldn\u2019t get into main venue washrooms to search for a change table for another 45 minutes. \n\nI asked the staff if there was anywhere I could use, they said anywhere I could so I used a bench (not a table) off in the corner of a closed section with no one around.", "NTA for throwing them out.

If i was another customer at that pub i would have been pissed, and probably either left or only ordered to go. A big problem comes in with how businesses/managent treat customers. \n\nAt one place I worked there was almost nothing besides actual threats and intimidation that could be used to justify asking someone to leave (we were not allowed to kick people out only management or security could do that) and even then would likely result in management just letting them back in.

Changing on a dining room table in a public restaurant? That's deplorable behavior. I'd have done the same.", "NTA.  What they were doing was very indecent not to mention highly unsanitary.  Your business if possible should leave a very polite (seasoned with a bit of snark) reply to the scathing review detailing very matter of fact their actions.", "NTA. If you\u2019re stupid enough to even think about changing a shit covered baby in a place of food, you should just never leave the house", "NTA, as a mom, that is disgusting and trashy", "NTA.\n\nIf other customer reported or Health Dept was conducting announced or unannounced inspection that they see poopy diaper on the dining table, restaurant could be promptly shut down.\nThen it\u2019s not worth at all even if they ordered most expensive bottles.\n\nThe family group brought 7 babies, if OP didn\u2019t stop them, I bet they\u2019d have changed more babies one by one on the dining table.\n\nIf OP didn\u2019t kick them out, other customers dining there would have left very negative reviews that they were fed next to poop and staff didn\u2019t do anything, for sure.", "Thank you.
