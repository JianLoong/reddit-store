Yes, she should have a nice time, but it isn't her big day. \nThe fact your so dismissive of your partners wasn't and preferences on BOTH of your weddings is rude. \n\nYour sister is 9, she's old enough to understand that it isn't her big day, that she has to wear something else etc. \nYou're marrying your fiancee, not your sister", "NTA, your sister is 9, a kid wearing a princess dress isn't going to ruin your wedding", "NTA. Guys can be bridezillas too. Groomzilla?", "NTA- BUT I think you guys need to communicate more.

I agree. But I also feel that this is such a small issue - and one that is only traditionally a concern because wearing white/grandiose stuff at a wedding typically clashes with the bride/takes away from the white wedding dress etc.\n\nIf you sincerely have no problem with that convention not being upheld, I struggle to see why he should. Even the \"so my sisters can too?\" thing suggests to me that he's not being good-faith about it, because he sounds like he was \\*hoping\\* you'd say no AND doesn't exactly suggest the issue itself of \"white, princessy at a wedding\" is his bigger concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Let kids be kids!

The problem here is that you didn't consult your fiancee about it and just made the decision.\n\nI'm sure you would be pissed if his best man asked if he could wear a tommy Bahama shirt instead of a tux and he just said... Yea go for it mate.\n\nShould it really matter... No. But if you are planning the event together then you should care what he thinks. If you asked him ahead of time I'm guessing either he would say ... Hey I really like the traditional route where only the bride wears white. Or... Thanks for asking but yea it probably doesn't matter tell her to wear what she likes. \n\nTBH I probably would have said the same thing.

You should have the final say, but there\u2019s a lot of planning that needs to be made together. Sounds like this is something the groom wants a bit of a say in. There isn\u2019t a problem with that per se, but it\u2019s up to you two to decide how much input you want each person to have.

And the bride's 9 y/o sister wearing a white princess dress is not going to cause drama for the whole wedding, unless the groom creates that drama.\n\nAlso, the rule about no white at weddings is for the *bride*'s benefit, and generally if the bride wants members of her wedding party in white or is wearing a different color dress and asks guests to avoid that color instead, that's her decision. The rule isn't for the groom's benefit, it is the bride's sister in *her* half of the wedding party, so while it is both of their wedding and decisions about things like venue, food, cake, dancing, set list, guest list, decorations, etc etc should all be joint, this particular decision should just be the bride's. And the dress the sister wants to wear sounds appropriate for a child at a wedding-- it's not like the kid wants to wear her favorite, idk, Darth Vader costume or something, which I think would fall into the \"could cause drama for the whole wedding, needs two yeses\" category.

The husband had a bad take, she belittled him, he got defensive and stuck to his argument even if his point was stupid, she continues to lay on an insult every response. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t breed a safe environment for discussion. That just eggs on aggression. If this is how someone argues with you, even when you\u2019re in the right, then THATS a huge problem for most people.\n\nWe all get angry and defensive about something stupid here and there. It\u2019s an ugly moment but it happens to us all. You gotta be ready to deal with your husband/wife\u2019s ugliness when it inevitably comes. Help each other be better."]}
