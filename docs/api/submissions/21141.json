While he\u2019s also obviously allowed to make decisions with regards to the wedding, it\u2019s just plain weird that he thinks a 9 year old and a 23 year old wearing white to a wedding is equivalent.

Yes, she should have a nice time, but it isn't her big day. \nThe fact your so dismissive of your partners wasn't and preferences on BOTH of your weddings is rude. \n\nYour sister is 9, she's old enough to understand that it isn't her big day, that she has to wear something else etc. \nYou're marrying your fiancee, not your sister", "NTA, your sister is 9, a kid wearing a princess dress isn't going to ruin your wedding", "NTA. Guys can be bridezillas too.

It\u2019s both of you guys\u2019 wedding but idk why your fianc\u00e9 is so upset by this, or upset that you\u2019re okay with his sister doing it too. The main problem with white dresses is that is shows up the bride, but if you the bride doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, and they\u2019re your bridesmaids- I don\u2019t see the problem", "Torn, but I lean NTA.\n\nI think ultimately the reason I feel that way is because it seems obvious that either: He's imposing a convention on you, the person that role is typically for (in a typical traditional wedding), against your will to the detriment of your little sister OR he's just straight up not being honest about why it is that this bothers him.\n\nOther people have said that it is his wedding too. I agree. But I also feel that this is such a small issue - and one that is only traditionally a concern because wearing white/grandiose stuff at a wedding typically clashes with the bride/takes away from the white wedding dress etc.\n\nIf you sincerely have no problem with that convention not being upheld, I struggle to see why he should. Even the \"so my sisters can too?\" thing suggests to me that he's not being good-faith about it, because he sounds like he was \\*hoping\\* you'd say no AND doesn't exactly suggest the issue itself of \"white, princessy at a wedding\" is his bigger concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Let kids be kids! Nobody is asking for a big dress code switch-up, just something nice for the little sister!\n\nPS: This sounds genuinely adorable!\n\nAlso ik I've edited this a bunch, but I will add: If a bride was depicted here being stubborn and weirdly unreasonable about a groom letting his little brother/nephew wear something cute and reasonable, it seems obvious that this would be the verdict, too.", "NTA- I think it's weird that people get so touchy about wedding dress attire. If a 9yr old wants to wear white, who cares?", "Hmm this sounds more like \"my family vs your family\" vibes.", "I was with N T A but then I read your comments and you don't seem to care what your fiance thinks at all. It's also his day. \n\nSaying you care more about your sister because you know her longer is really telling (?!). You're marrying him and your sister shouldn't have more say in the wedding than him.\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\n> asked him if he is worried that she will outshine HIM?\n\nWell, how good does he look in a princess dress? Some people just can't pull off the look.\n\nI think it's unfair he wants only his sisters to also get to wear princess dresses. EVERYONE SHOULD! It's your special day and you can set the dress code!", "NTA.

He shouldn't be quibbling about your little sister wearing a white dress, but I also understand where he might be coming from (emotionally). This should be a special day for both of you.", "NTA, I was very nearly ESH because his opinion does matter too, but went NTA because I think you said what you said because your instinct is right, he is worried about a nine year old outshining him.", "Very VERY mild ESH. (Just you two, not your sister obviously). He\u2019s overreacting since she\u2019s only nine but it\u2019s his wedding too. I don\u2019t think asking if he worries that your sister will outshine him was the best idea. Honestly just find a compromise because it will barely matter to you both on the happiest day of your life.", "NTA.You seem pretty easy-going, but your groom does not. There's also a big difference between a child wearing white v. the adult attendants. If you don't care, I'm not sure why he would, but I guess it's the same as a bride insisting on a certain look for the groom and groomsmen. NTA. Good luck.", "NTA- what is he worried that people are going to think he\u2019s marrying the 9 year old because she\u2019s in white? Who cares?", "NTA. Brides predominantly are the ones who chose the Bridesmaids dresses and the Groom choses his Best Man and Groomsmen outfits. If you don't have a problem with the princess dress then he should respect your decision.", "It's not everyday we get to witness the ultra-rare groomzilla, but here we are. If the fiance is so hung up on such a trivial thing, how will he behave with the big things?", "Meh soft YTA... Look everyone has different thoughts about what is appropriate wedding attire. The problem here is that you didn't consult your fiancee about it and just made the decision.\n\nI'm sure you would be pissed if his best man asked if he could wear a tommy Bahama shirt instead of a tux and he just said... Yea go for it mate.\n\nShould it really matter... No. But if you are planning the event together then you should care what he thinks. If you asked him ahead of time I'm guessing either he would say ... Hey I really like the traditional route where only the bride wears white. Or... Thanks for asking but yea it probably doesn't matter tell her to wear what she likes. \n\nTBH I probably would have said the same thing. That if she's a bridesmaid have her dress according to what the others are wearing.", "NTA. He's being weird. It may be a red flag of control that he's trying to decide on your brides maid's attire or other guests' attire.", "INFO: Would you be ok if the groomsmen were in jorts and tank tops? \n\nIf no, then you probably need to communicate a bit more. You should have the final say, but there\u2019s a lot of planning that needs to be made together. Sounds like this is something the groom wants a bit of a say in. There isn\u2019t a problem with that per se, but it\u2019s up to you two to decide how much input you want each person to have. That\u2019s part of the marriage process and learning to live and make decisions together.", "YTA - honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal but\u2026 it\u2019s also his wedding too. If he thinks the white dress isn\u2019t appropriate, his opinion is valid and not \u201ccrazy\u201d", "YTA - softly - #1 for disregarding your finances opinions/feelings on the matter #2 it is a WEDDING not a a fantasy princess date for a 9 year old. \n\nSure - its\"no big deal\" until the wedding day and lil princess acts like a 9 year old - innocently interferes with pictures etc. Slippery slope. You're indulging her instead of leading her. \n\nCould you have a special day for you & her with all her princess dresses to get your nails done etc before the wedding. This is about your marriage - not her fantasy.  Your Man is right to be offended if you're already putting her fantasy ahead of your husband.", "NTA, anyone saying otherwise is weird", "NTA, you have a manzilla on your hands!

Your 9 yo sister is actually doing everything right.  \"May I wear my white princess dress\" is the correct step 1.

And the bride's 9 y/o sister wearing a white princess dress is not going to cause drama for the whole wedding, unless the groom creates that drama.\n\nAlso, the rule about no white at weddings is for the *bride*'s benefit, and generally if the bride wants members of her wedding party in white or is wearing a different color dress and asks guests to avoid that color instead, that's her decision. The rule isn't for the groom's benefit, it is the bride's sister in *her* half of the wedding party, so while it is both of their wedding and decisions about things like venue, food, cake, dancing, set list, guest list, decorations, etc etc should all be joint, this particular decision should just be the bride's. And the dress the sister wants to wear sounds appropriate for a child at a wedding-- it's not like the kid wants to wear her favorite, idk, Darth Vader costume or something, which I think would fall into the \"could cause drama for the whole wedding, needs two yeses\" category. Since the only issue with the dress is that it's white, and the no-white rule is for the bride, + bride's sister and in the bridal party -- it should be her choice, and it's kind of weird that he's sos insistent on it.", "Yeah, and I agree that she should be allowed to wear it but I just think you need to talk to your fianc\u00e9 again and make sure he\u2019s happy.", "Lol I've been married over a decade.
