I agree. But I also feel that this is such a small issue - and one that is only traditionally a concern because wearing white/grandiose stuff at a wedding typically clashes with the bride/takes away from the white wedding dress etc.\n\nIf you sincerely have no problem with that convention not being upheld, I struggle to see why he should. Even the \"so my sisters can too?\" thing suggests to me that he's not being good-faith about it, because he sounds like he was \\*hoping\\* you'd say no AND doesn't exactly suggest the issue itself of \"white, princessy at a wedding\" is his bigger concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Let kids be kids!

Yea go for it mate.\n\nShould it really matter... No. But if you are planning the event together then you should care what he thinks.

And the bride's 9 y/o sister wearing a white princess dress is not going to cause drama for the whole wedding, unless the groom creates that drama.\n\nAlso, the rule about no white at weddings is for the *bride*'s benefit, and generally if the bride wants members of her wedding party in white or is wearing a different color dress and asks guests to avoid that color instead, that's her decision. The rule isn't for the groom's benefit, it is the bride's sister in *her* half of the wedding party, so while it is both of their wedding and decisions about things like venue, food, cake, dancing, set list, guest list, decorations, etc etc should all be joint, this particular decision should just be the bride's.

Lol im not the one making a big deal about a 9yo in a dress. Doesn\u2019t the bride or groom decide what is appropriate at their own wedding? You would really say that to a 9yo because some 20+ guy doesn\u2019t like it? Im so confused here XD", "No, she is in the right. The conflict presented here is that OP and her fiance had an argument because her fiance has a problem with the dress OP's 9 years old sister wants to wear to the wedding even though OP is ok with it.\n\nHer fiance is crazy for having beef with a dress and/or a 9 year old.", "yeah thats why im concerned about him because clearly if he has issues with her 9 year old sister being excited to be a princess there are some issues that OP nor we know about", "They're probably talking about seeing that user in particular acting this way not all users criticism of women like.", "I don\u2019t understand why you hold a 9 year old\u2019s opinion about your wedding day in higher regard than that of the man you\u2019re marrying.", "yup. my thoughts exactly", "Yes! \ud83d\udcaf", "Honestly???\nHe is obviously of the belief that no one should wear white but the bride. It's a very popular mindset. Chang the colour and get her a princess dress matching the colour the other bridesmaids wear. \n\nShe's part of the wedding party, so yes, he does get an opinion on it, the same way you would if one of his groomsmen was wearing something you thought wouldn't be suitable.", "You don't get to decide what he's allowed to care about on his wedding day. If you can't even give him a say on what he wants for his wedding, you're probably not ever going to take his wants/needs seriously. Huge red flag, I hope he stands his ground here", "It's HIS wedding too. If he doesn't want someone to wear a **literal costume**, that's a valid point - and you're an asshole for being so dismissive.\n\nA good person would have discussed a *compromise* with him and taken her sister out for a super special shopping trip to get her excited for a different dress. You aren't a good person.\n\nWhy are you marrying someone you don't love? **Even if you don't care about his happiness, being with someone you've made miserable won't make your life happy either.**", "Why are you on here if you already made up your mind? I hope you're fianc\u00e9 sees through you.", "you're actually delusional.... you think that 20+ year old guy's opinion doesn't matter at his own wedding....", "Seemed kind of like a personal attack so im done with them and not engaging. \n\nBut im pretty active in this sub and call lots of people AHs.", "9 yr old has an opinion about what she was told she can wear; whatever she wants. \n\nThat is separate from fiances opinion that she shouldn't wear it to their wedding.", "Because the 9yo has an opinion about her own autonomy. The man I'm marrying has an opinion about someone else's autonomy", "The fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable and insecure", "Yeah except this convention is one that can be waived by the one who would normally wear white", "It's not unusual for young girls (flower girls and junior bridesmaids) to wear white. Pretty common, in fact. Heck, in some countries the adult bridesmsids wear white too. And the bride chooses what her bridesmaids wear, not the groom. If she's fine with it, what's he getting so bent out of shape about? Does he have issues with the little sisters or something?", "A *nine year old* is wearing a white princess dress with the bride's blessing, not the bride or groom's mother, his sisters, or an adult guest. She's telling him it's no big deal, and he's saying it's inappropriate for a *child* to wear white. That would be understandable if the bride were upset. People are not going to mistake the kid for the bride; people are not going to think he's marrying a child.", "I mean, if a bride and a groom had mixed-gender (but still separately \u201cgroom\u2019s\u201d and \u201cbride\u2019s\u201d) wedding parties, and the only edict was the groom\u2019s people wear grey and the bride\u2019s wear blue, I feel like this sub would resoundingly vote the bride T A if she vetoed one of the groom\u2019s ladies\u2019 requests to wear a grey suit\u2014even though her groom supports his friend and wants to grant her request because he wants her to like what she\u2019s wearing\u2014just because she as the bride thinks the women in the wedding party generally should all wear dresses.\n\nEDT: I feel like OP\u2019s attitude is triggering a lot of people, and they end up unconsciously assuming that OP has been steamrolling her fianc\u00e9 over wedding decisions that should be made together simply because of her attitude in comments here\u2014but this isn\u2019t really a \u201ctogether\u201d decision. This is more like the fianc\u00e9 trying to veto a proposed location for the bachelorette party than him vetoing a wedding color or a song for the wedding party processional.", "He gets an opinion. Everybody *gets an opinion.*\nThat in no way implies that he necessarily gets everything he wants. \n\nThe other person whose opinion matters is fine with it.", "What is the problem with a 9yo at the wedding? He has a right to voice his opinion, but that doesn\u2019t mean it makes any sense or that he\u2019s right."]}
