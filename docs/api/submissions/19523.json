Yours, Mine, Ours situation. I recently had surgery which left me with many restrictions for several weeks. 18 decided to go spend the first week with their bio-mom, even after having agreed to help me and being told what that entailed (housework, nothing medical or hygenic). 17 agreed to help as well but they're not able to do everything by themselves either. During this week, 18 missed several days of work for various reasons then messaged me saying they were going back to BM's after the one day they did go to work.\n\nH and I talked then I told 18 that should they do that, they were to come to the house first, gather their clothing, and leave their phone (on our plan) and everything else as they are showing they are wishing to not be part of this household due to willfully neglecting their responsibilities. I explained that we are not evicting them, merely outlining what is expected and what their other option was at that time. Yes, I know it should have been H's responsibility to have this conversation, but they don't always see eye to eye and it may have led to a fight where 18 did leave.\n\nThey came home that night then cleaned one counter the following day after being asked to help with the kitchen. As expected, there was a lot of attitude and grumbling. I explained that we don't WANT them to leave. We love them and want them to have a stable home until they're ready to go. We have tried to guide them gently and easily but that hasn't proven to work so it's time for tough love. H and I told them that even if they choose to leave, they will have our support in everything they do, just not financially.\n\nWhile we have good jobs for our area, we cannot afford to keep paying for an adult who doesn't wish to participate in the household. Unfortunately, the extreme lack of reliability to do chores by myself (health issues that surgery hopefully corrected) and the oldest two (refusal to help except for random bouts of generosity on their parts) has taught the younger ones that they don't need to help either. We're working on getting everyone on track. H has been the one to pick up all the slack and it's wearing him down.\n\nI do want to say that 18 and I usually get along wonderfully. 18 has told me on multiple occasions that BM wants them to move in with them so if they left here, they do technically have somewhere to go. We're just leary because BM is basically two steps above needing to live in a group home setting.\n\nI just don't know if I did the right thing by laying out clear expectations for them to stay or if I should have just let them continue on as they have been and keep silent.", "created_utc": 1686463562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146m41l/aita_for_giving_my_18yo_an_ultimatum_to_continue/", "score": 130, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If 18 didn\u2019t do chores knowing that it was expected as their \u201crent\u201d and they chose not to do them, then it\u2019s reasonable to evict.  However this situation seems more like you are trying to teach them a lesson /punish them for not doing chores.  I know it seems kinda the same but the second way creates a huge amount of instability for 18 because anything they do that you don\u2019t like could trigger the manipulative \u201cWe will kick you out if you don\u2019t behave how we want\u201d.  \nJust be careful to clearly lay out expectations and consiquences and don\u2019t move the goalposts at a whim and I would say you are ok.", "YTA. I\u2019m confused by all the mixed signals. Were they failing an expectation to help as special arrangement because of your surgery or as normal household contribution? Were you angry because they missed some days of their paying job work or because they weren\u2019t at your house doing the house work? Did you tell them to leave because they did come home sufficiently but didn\u2019t help enough, or because although they did wipe the counter but hadn\u2019t been home enough? And what was the relation between the location of residence versus providing financial support? If your 18 is half as confused as I am, they are probably very confused. I\u2019m okay with parents giving an ultimatum of do X or leave, but it\u2019s very unclear what x is supposed to be.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t understand why you are trying to exercise this level of control over this kid.  If they are at their mom\u2019s house, they aren\u2019t there messing up your home.  Then you tell them to get their stuff and leave the phone?  Then you are mad because all they did was wipe the counter?\n\nHonestly, you sound like a damn nightmare.", "Did they agree to help out or did you tell them they had to?

The 18yo is living at your house (presumably making messes) and then leaving to go stay with their mother to get out of cleaning. Is this correct?\n\nBy doing this they are also missing their paid job & are at risk of being fired. \n\nINFO: does the 18yo need to use the money from this job to pay you rent/board, to save for college, or anything else? Will you be expected to support 18yo through college (incl accomodation, groceries, tuition)? \n\nUnless the chores you are asking your children to do are wildly inappropriate I've got to go NTA. If living at your house comes with the conditions of reasonable chores +/- rent contributions & the 18yo is not meeting these requirements due to irresponsibility they can move out.", "NTA for setting reasonable conditions like \"do your share of chores and keep a job\". Idk where all these other folks are coming from, but \"do your chores and keep a job\" is a pretty good trade for a free place to live and a free phone.", "YTA - typical Stepmom trying to control the household. Get a grip", "what the fuck is up with Americans (assuming you are) and threatening their children with kicking them out as soon as they turn 18, i cannot fathom how they find that acceptable", "YTA. 18 is an adult. You cannot *tell* them to do anything, regardless of the threats you use. You can ask, however.\n\nDid you make a polite request of what you'd hoped would happen? Or did you make a demand?\n\nThe problem with ultimatums, is that you risk the person you're threatening might just take you up on it.", "Looks like nobody read carefully. OP is pissed bc 18 y.o. abandoned her after a major surgery after promising to help out. I can understand the frustration. The other older kids are acting like lazy children instead of helping out as well. \nOP, I think you're coming down hard on the 18 year old because you're tired and disappointed. But even so this is a little extreme and you risk alienation.", "NTA. Our kids always helped us out with chores because we always emphasised that we were a team that worked together. \n\nGrowing up, most kids in my country town helped inside and out from about age 8, looked after younger kids from age 10. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why anyone thinks you\u2019re asking too much, especially because everyone can understand that it\u2019s a temporary situation.", "NTA.

It's too much.\n\n'after being asked to help with the kitchen' - I don't want to imagine what a kitchen with 7 users, most of them children looks like at the end of the day. It's just too much. The grind and hard work you two both brought into their lives is too much, the constant fighting about it is too much. The need to flee away at 18 because your dad has too many kids and it's a tress pool with no place for you - it's too much.\n\nYou just have too many kids and now you need to kick out the step-ones to have a manageable amount, and now that the first one is legally kickable they're out and soon the next one would be out and then you finally succeeded in ripping apart a family to make a place for yours. You and your husband are both the AH.", "EDIT: based on OP\u2019s new comments below, I\u2019m going with NTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re expecting a lot and the 18 yr old is going back on their word. They are an adult - they can help out. Even as much as cooking 1 night a week. My siblings and I were helping with dinner when we were in our teens. This is how you learn life skills. However, if they\u2019ve never done it before then they need help! \n\nBut I would say dad needs to be the one to be setting boundaries and chores too - even if it is a difficult conversation. \n\nYou should both be teaching them that chores are normal. It\u2019s only when you cross over to parentification that you\u2019d be the a-holes. \n\nORIGINAL COMMENT:\n\nI need more information become I can make a judgement. \n\nDoes the 18 yr old also go to school? Or do they work full time? And how much extra house work are they expected to do? Help out here and there or are they looking after the younger kids, cooking and feeding them, cleaning after everyone? You have a 3 yr old and they\u2019re hard work. \n\nNow, if the expectation was they would help with small day to day chores and generally pitching in then I\u2019d say NTA. At 18 they should be helping around the house anyway, same as the 17 yr old. It\u2019s normal for most teenagers to be able to do small chores. I would be pretty pissed off if they left to go to bio mum\u2019s house just to get out of helping. \n\nBasically, did the 18yr old leave because you expected too much?", "NTA\n\nUnless you're skipping a lot of information, I see nothing wrong in what you've done. It sounds like you honestly want the kid to stay there, to the point where you prevented your husband from laying into the kid and forcing the issue to where the kid would leave out of spite. You spoke calmly and clearly explained your and your husband's expectations. You've given the kid a chance to prove they want to be there. That's not unreasonable at 18. It also sets the stage for the 17 year old next year. I assume you are just asking for help in a desperate situation and not just lumping everything on them. It sounds like instead of helping they chose to take a vacation during your time of need. And you even said that's fine, but you aren't going to continue financial support if they aren't even going to help at all. Kids have chores. This kid is refusing to do theirs and I'm guessing the bio-mom isn't helping at all other than giving the kid a place to hide when they don't want to work OR do chores.", "You are both TA and NTA.\n\nThe part where you are TA: \n\u25cfthey just recently became adult aged and most likely still have their childhood mentality. Unless you prepared them for years prior to 18 of what to expect it's a little unreasonable.\n\u25cfsudden ultimatum of they have to move out if they don't do what you want and meet your expectations of what a family member should do.\n\nNTA part:\n\u25cfit is your house and you are allowed to ask for people to pick up after themselves and you can technically enforce it but that kid and you will never have the same relationship. Try talking to them differently. Instead of saying your expectations ask them for help and let them know how much it would mean for you to have this help while you recover. They are still young and may just not be into helping but you need to consider what that action will lead to in the future for you both.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re dealing with late teens here who usually don\u2019t respond to this type of blackmail too well. It completely undermines mutual trust, and they are old enough to understand and feel that. As such, these type of conversations can have a significant impact on your relationship with them for a very long time.\n\nTheir lack of effort now, is a direct result of letting them get away with this behavior in years past. Do you realize that? \n\nWhat I would\u2019ve done in your situation is not get mad and post threats, but just express how disappointed you really are in them. Tell them that you are aware that you\u2019ve often let them get away with not doing their chores, but that you\u2019ve always trusted that you raised caring people who help one another and step up their game in times of real need, like when someone is sick and recovering from surgery, and especially when knowing that them doing too much themselves can negatively impact their health and wellbeing for years to come. \n\nIt\u2019s not to late to apologize to them for the threat and share your disappointment instead.", "Both, its always good to keep your children in check like this, but then i realized shes not really ur child. Unless you're willing to tell this to your own daughter as well, i'd say YTA and one of those evil step moms that wants the step daughter gone and out. She's 18, i doubt she even has a job that pays her enough to survive on her own. Does she go to college? if she does and you're still on her case about going to her crappy work that wont even pay enough for utility bills, then YTA for sure. If she is currently free and not going to college, NTA.", "YTA \n\n>While we have good jobs for our area, we cannot afford to keep paying for an adult who doesn't wish to participate in the household.\n\nThat seems unlikely. If you have good jobs, one more mouth to feed isn't gonna bankrupt you. It comes over as if you want him out for the wrong reasons", "YTA gone are the days where an 18 year old can make it fine on there old. This days were dead and gone 20 years ago so no excuses. Family members having health issues can be traumatic on children (18 is still a child even if the law disagrees) and there are already lots of changes going on in an 18 year Olds life even when they don't have to take over part of what a patent was doing. Part of me is torn because if the surgery was necessary (like time sensitive and urgent not like an elective surgery you could have now or whenever) then stepping up would be good but then a parent you care about having an emergency surgery is hard to deal with.", "YTA. Give them a chance, why give an ultimatum and backpedal? Kids prolly confused af", "YTA - I'm a bit biased about this. When I turned 18 my mother told me to live in her house I needed to be in school or to have a job. \n\nI started working. I then was told \"I need rent money note that you're working\", so I started posting her $500 a month for the bedroom that I was told was my safe space. \n\nWhile I was working, I didn't have a car, and was stuck riding the bus 1hr 45 mins each way. It was a minimum wage job that paid 9.75/HR.\n\nFull time. \n\nShe then insisted I needed to help clean the house on top of it and help take care of my little sister.\n\nThe entire time the expectations of what I needed to do, kept changing. \n\nOne night after 12ish hours of working/being on the bus, I got home and was told I needed to take off the lawn. I told her no.\n\nShe told me to get out, so I did. \n\nI talk to her at most 6 times a year. She gives poor, hurtful advice. \n\nI respect her, but I know she doesn't actually love me.

These kids are nearly adults; high time they started acting like it.  And yep, the little ones are watching.", "YTA.\n\nParents shouldn't treat their kids as unpaid help or someone they can control. Kids don't turn adults just because they turned 18, they need sometime grow up in the world too. Their regular responsibilities should be imposed upon them, yes. Yet it is not their duty to take care of you or feel obligated to, unless they want to. Exercising control over them, is only going to alienate you from them, but the other kids learn from it too.", "Hey,\n\nNTA, though it seems a bit of a major jump between doing whatever they want to this, so I'd have saved that kind of ultimatum (we love you, please choose to stay) for drugs and immoral activities.\n\nIt's likely 18 and 17, not to mention the lil uns, don't even know that well how to do chores, and yes it's tiring and annoying. 18 and 17 might be feeling like they're suddenly expected to do a lot, without realising that you and H have been doing ALL of it. \ud83d\ude12\n\nI would make a list with H of the chores you want them to do on a daily/weekly basis, decide on a number (6 for 18 and 17, 4 for 10 and 8, 2 for 3 -- yes that will mostly be help with picking up their toys and help \"folding\" their clothes) and let 18-8 take turns choose their preferred chores for the week. Let them each pick one, then another one, etc. \n\nMake it clear that the chores will rotate at times, and won't always be their preferred ones, even if you'll do your best. Dishes are probably the most problematic and unless someone loves doing them, this has to be everyone's resp in turn).\n\nMake it everyone's responsibility -- if everything gets done, you can all go on a picnic or something. Not a big deal. Cleaning your room isn't Disneyland material. But it's important to point out that everyone picking up slack gives a previous exhausted you time and energy for family activities.\n\nGood luck, OP. You're good parents.", "YTA. If 18 was a few years older maybe, but that\u2019s really harsh and damaging imo to say to someone just out of high school. Yeah 18 has another option but it doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy one. And the post high school/college transition is really hard for a lot of people. It\u2019s like a peak time for the development of mental health issues.  I\u2019m not sure what BM\u2019s issues are but maybe the kid has some generic or environmentally induced vulnerabilities to something because of that? Growing up with a parent \u201ctwo steps above a group home\u201d and also Going through a parents divorce/remarriage can already be hard on a kids sense of security and attachment and then being threatened to be kicked out of your home is just another blow to that. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like 18 is used to chores. You can talk to them about expectations, why they are important  and consequences without it being about kicking them out. And also talk to them about their barriers to meeting the expectations. (Eg if chores feel tedious they can be done while listening to music, podcasts, talking on the phone). If the kid is given a manageable amount of chores to start with (eg if they\u2019re not used to doing any chores, asking them to do an entire list of things because you\u2019re having surgery may feel too overwhelming) and they\u2019re missing their job to hide with BM jus to get out of the housework, it sounds like they need some counselling or something else is going on.", "NTA  You sound very reasonable and put thought into these parenting decisions. You honestly needed the older kids help right now. If they don't contribute by helping around the house they should pay a small portion of rent. The kid knows M is no place to live.", "YTA, you appear to be threatening to kick them out over a few missed chores.\n\nThe implication here seems to be you think they went to their mum's to get out of chores but that's a really self-centred assumption. They also missed work, have you considered there's something else going on?\n\nYour signals are really mixed in the post but it sounds like you've not placed a great deal of expectation on them to do chores before they turn 18 but the second you can legally kick them out they have to do chores to earn a right to stay. People don't actually change when they hit 18 you know, if you haven't installed those habits they're not suddenly going to appear.", "YTA\n\nKids don\u2019t earn their right to be in our lives and homes.\n\nTake the ultimatum off the table and apologize. Any guardian doing that to a child is an AH.\n\nAnd yea they just turned 18, that\u2019s a difference of weeks and months not adulthood: we all know we are barely adulting until our 30s on average. Give your kids a break Reddit..\n\nHaving kids who help and are easy to manage is NICE, but it\u2019s not a requirement for them to be our kids.\n\nIt\u2019s fine you can\u2019t afford to financially support elsewhere. But to have her leave her phone etc. and evict - just the fear and power play\u2026you\u2019re sooo wrong putting that on kids.", "YTA for how you handled this. I agree with the other posters who are confused about exactly what the 18 yr old was meant to have been doing and when, which means the 18 yr old could have been just as confused. \n\nI also cannot understand why the response to your teenager being a pretty typical teenager was to... kick them out? Because although you said you weren't evicting them, *you were totally evicting them.* You can try to \"technically\" and \"well actually\" through it, but that kid now knows that although you say you love and support \"all\" the kids, you're also completely ok with kicking them out. The mixed signals here are ridiculous.\n\nYou're also TA for the crappy comment about the bio mum and the group home. Not only is it shitty, it was completely irrelevant to the post. If you were legitimately concerned, you wouldn't have let the 18 yr go there for a week, or have visits there. But you clearly do. It comes across as a snarky stab, just because you can. That's pretty gross.\n\nAnd you're right, H should have handled it. And if it devolved into a fight and the 18yr old left? *Well you were kicking them out anyway, so what difference is that going to make.*\n\nStart earlier with the other kids. The rule here is \"you live here, you help to the best of your capabilities.\" We're gentle parents (you mention trying to do things gently), my kids are teens and a young adult, and gentle parenting doesn't mean you don't have come-to-jesus talks about expectations, team work and respect. But it DOES mean you find ways to communicate and meet everyone's needs without threats or kicking out your kids. You can hold the 18yr old accountable for not keeping their word, and for not helping out when it was needed, but if you yeet them out of the house, you can't do anything.", "YTA \nThe household dynamics are a direct consequence of your parenting so far.", "[deleted]", "YTA  \nI don't think you have bad intentions, but i don't think you are doing the right thing here.  \n\n\nYou are totally entitled to have expectations, helping with the chores is reasonable on paper.  \nBut you need to look at why these expectations are not being met. I can't look into his brain but here's some possible things that could be going on.  \n1: He might struggle with executive dysfunction. some people struggle with tasks they have to do. It might be because they cant handle stress very well, their brain isnt cooperating, or they have trouble breaking tasks down into manageable pieces and get overwhelmed  \n2: He might suffer from mental health issues: there are lots of conditions that just drain you of all your mental energy and make it tough to keep up with necessary tasks.  \n3: He might be having a rough time and just coping very badly with it. people are weird animals, and sometimes they respond to tough situations in shitty ways. Reexamining your behaviours and healthy coping mechanisms are things that need to be learned.  \n\n\nAnyways, if you DO kick your son out, He is probably not gonna fair well. If he struggles going to work consistently, he is not ready to be self-sufficient. He might actually face homelessness. when its sink or swim, many people do sink, and you need to be aware of that.  \n\n\nTough love does not work for a lot of people, it makes things worse in some cases.  \nEither way you cut it, your son needs help. Sit down with him, approach him with love and kindness, but stay firm that things do need to change. work together with him and find the root of the problem, and what steps you can take to make things better. I promise both of you will be happier if you can work together on this.  \n\n\nI got kicked out in a very similar way in my early 20s. I had a boatload of unaddressed mental health issues, both 1 and 2, which could have been adressed. But unfortunately neither me or my parents were able to admit i had actual problems, and so i got kicked out, became homeless twice, and suffered several mental breakdowns so bad, it left me legally severely disabled. Been in recovery for 2 years and i am very slowly clawing my way back to functioning with little progress.", "Yta. What\u2019s your husband doing? What housework needs multiple people? That the 17 year old cannot finish themselves???? I understand the frustration but you should\u2019ve handled this as a team rather then push the household responsibilities onto your children. I understand pulling your weight but they weren\u2019t there at the house so why should they work there??? You\u2019re not making sense.

Yours, Mine, Ours situation. I recently had surgery which left me with many restrictions for several weeks. 18 decided to go spend the first week with their bio-mom, even after having agreed to help me and being told what that entailed (housework, nothing medical or hygenic). 17 agreed to help as well but they're not able to do everything by themselves either. During this week, 18 missed several days of work for various reasons then messaged me saying they were going back to BM's after the one day they did go to work.\n\nH and I talked then I told 18 that should they do that, they were to come to the house first, gather their clothing, and leave their phone (on our plan) and everything else as they are showing they are wishing to not be part of this household due to willfully neglecting their responsibilities. I explained that we are not evicting them, merely outlining what is expected and what their other option was at that time. Yes, I know it should have been H's responsibility to have this conversation, but they don't always see eye to eye and it may have led to a fight where 18 did leave.\n\nThey came home that night then cleaned one counter the following day after being asked to help with the kitchen. As expected, there was a lot of attitude and grumbling. I explained that we don't WANT them to leave. We love them and want them to have a stable home until they're ready to go. We have tried to guide them gently and easily but that hasn't proven to work so it's time for tough love. H and I told them that even if they choose to leave, they will have our support in everything they do, just not financially.\n\nWhile we have good jobs for our area, we cannot afford to keep paying for an adult who doesn't wish to participate in the household. Unfortunately, the extreme lack of reliability to do chores by myself (health issues that surgery hopefully corrected) and the oldest two (refusal to help except for random bouts of generosity on their parts) has taught the younger ones that they don't need to help either.

I am from the US, so I can tell you that the amount of disposable income we have isn't adequate to pay for raising a kid here in most places and on a typical American income. It costs several thousand dollars to deliver the kid in a hospital even with insurance. There's no subsidized daycare--or even readily available unsubsidized daycare in many cities. There's no mandatory paid parental or sick leave. There's no subsidized after school care. If you want your kid to go to a good school, you have to live in an area with more property taxes (ie more expensive houses). Health insurance isn't universal here, so expect an extra tens of thousands of dollars a year to cover your kids. Then, the US expects parents to pay for their kids' college education (even if many don't), which also isn't subsidized like it is in many countries. This leaves many parents choosing between supporting their kid after 18 and being able to save some money for retirement, especially if there are other kids or aging parents to take care of.

No one knew anything about it so the two that had the taffy had to work together to clean it up.\n\nWe tried doing where we each take a room (living room, dining room, main bathroom, kitchen) and tackle it but it wasn't working because the kitchen is a disproportionate room to the others so we broke it down by using a popsicle stick method. Everyone draws three sticks and those are their chores for that day. But it's broken down like take out the trash, load the dishwasher, clear the table after dinner. It's hasn't been working well so far but I'm still hopeful since I will be able to do more once I'm cleared by the surgeon.\n\nI know a lot of it is they saw how H worked harder than me so I wasn't setting a good example.

Perhaps being able to anticipate what chores will get done when and knowing that everyone is doing every chore regularly can help mend potential feelings of unfairness that make doing the tasks a bit more difficult.\n\nEdit: Perhaps this is also a problem of feeling like the house belongs to everyone living in it, too, since they're good about cleaning their own space. Currently living with roommate, I can attest to the fact that knowing the kitchen is not \"your\" room, and that someone else might gross it out *right* after you clean it, makes it very difficult to actually get that cleaning done in the first place. Perhaps, instead of threatening to kick them out, you should encourage them to also take ownership of shared spaces. Encourage them to help themselves, or make whatever food they feel like making, or using the kitchen for anything else they might need, and teach them that cleaning up is an essential part of the process too.", "Congratulations, you have somehow managed to see 18 when the poster said 15.

I'm sorry your parents hindered your growth by not preparing you for adulthood. That isn't your fault. Mine actually did the same, but I moved out at 16 and taught myself the skills I needed.\n\nIn OP's case, the family has been expecting chores from all the kids for a very long time. The parents are also trying to reinforce the concept of empathy ie helping out a little more than usual when one family member is recovering from surgery and is physically disabled.\n\nThis is how to show you care for people on your team ie your family. The 18 year old agreed to it and backed out. There's nothing traumatizing or out of line about not wanting to financially support an adult who knows how to be responsible but is choosing not to.

You\u2019re a two parent family so that falls to your partner too. You have children between you.\n\nYou can have expectations of reasonable chores etc of older teens and young adult children in your house that relate to privileges they get or not,  but the 18 yo has  just finished their exams and are probably really shattered.

I appreciate you said they\u2019ve let their work down but it sounds like a PT job (that may not be giving them any time off after exams) and they may not have seen BM for a while, having spent months studying hard. They do need a mental break. \n\nIf you & partner choose this as a hill to die in (or take a stand), I  think you\u2019ll regret it. It\u2019s never a good idea to even subtly threaten one of your children newly 18 with being thrown out, which is essentially what you\u2019re doing even if they have BM to live with- you have indicated BM\u2019s  situation isn\u2019t maybe stable \n\nTry to negotiate if you can and appreciate maybe they needed a little break.
