The fact that your mum said she was going to sue you, her own daughter over a necklace that was given to you - not her. If it's gifted to you from your grandma then it's your choice what you do with it, I might understand her getting mad if you sold it but you didn't, you gave it to your cousin who is also a grandchild of your late grandma. Your mum is just mad because she wanted to sell it eventually - doubt she really believes it's about the tradition.", "NTA. If you're named in your grandma's will, then you're the rightful owner of the necklace and can gift as you see fit. Make sure your cousin has a safety deposit box somewhere to keep it. I think what you did was very sweet. My grandpa died when I was about that age and I absolutely adored him.

I\u2019m gonna said Granny would have been proud. F that, you have a pure and genuine spirit to want your cousin to have the heirloom.  It was technically yours to do with as you wish. Don\u2019t change.", "NTA\n\nYour mum is being ureasonable\n\nSounds like she actually wanted the locket herself and maybe was able to \"give it up\" for her daughter, but now feels like it was useless gesture and is angry at everyone (maybe not the case at all, maybe she's just plain greedy about the money etc), if that's the case I think you should try to have a deep conversation with her , it might help decompress if she voices all of that calmly.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your locket and you can do what you want with it. Obviously it made your cousin, who seemed pretty attached to her grandmother, very happy. She deserved it. Your mom and family seem pretty entitled (no offense).", "NTA, from the sounds of it, I think your mom wants to sell the locket now since you got it appraised. If she\u2019s gonna sue you for it, I\u2019d definitely search for legal advice regarding gifts. Usually if something was gifted to you it becomes yours and you have the right to do what you want with it, but I know in some places gifting isn\u2019t considered ownership (I think it all comes down to whatever it is you were gifted, like if a car was gifted to you but in someone else name, then the car belongs to the person who bought it.). This whole thing might turn out to be a whole nothing burger, but I would definitely still search for legal advice just to be on the safe side about this.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to understand that this was your locket. That means that you can choose what happens to it, and you chose to give it to your cousin.\n\nFor what it's worth, \"I'm not going to have kids, so I'm going to pass it on to my cousin who also loved grandma and might one day have a daughter\" sounds like a really nice thing to do.", "NTA.  Your mom is being unreasonable and petty.", "Obviously NTA", "NTA. Your locket, your choice. Does your mother have any legal grounds to dispute this? Seems ludicrous", "NTA. \n\nIt was left to you. It became your property. You gifted it. That was your right. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  Your motives were pure and sincere, and the necklace stayed in the family.  My guess is that your grandmother would be proud of you.  Not so sure how she would feel about how your mother is behaving tho.", "NTA and it\u2019s utterly bizarre that your mother is acting the way that she is! It was given to you so you have every right to choose to gift it to your cousin in turn. It was a lovely thing to do and it sounds like your cousin will treasure it as a token of her relationship with her grandmother and with you. \n\nI highly doubt your mum has a single leg to stand on if she actually tries to sue for it. Laws vary of course, but if you have documentation of having paid for insurance on the necklace then that ought to be enough to prove your ownership of it.\n\nYour mum is 100% the asshole here. Tell her Reddit said so! \ud83d\ude02", "NTA it was given to you and it was your possession.\nYou chose to gift it to someone else for whom it will have meaning.\nIt won\u2019t mean anything to your sister in law.\nIt was a lovely thing to do and I am sorry that your mom made you doubt your decision", "NTA Tell your mom if she sues you, you are never going NC with her indefinitely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
