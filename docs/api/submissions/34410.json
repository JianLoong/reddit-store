I've seen this from both angles, and it's just best to put your foot down and pay separately even if someone offers to treat everyone (unless it's like... your birthday, maybe), and firmly establish boundaries early because otherwise it will get uncomfortable, you may lose relationships you'd rather keep, and there will be a lot of resentment either way.", "Those are not your friends.", "NTA.
