She'd be drinking $10 mixed drinks I'd drink $5 beers. She'd always try to split the bill equally \"because its only fair\". After a while I did what you did and started getting my own tab. We stopped hanging out so much shortly after. Seems she was having cash flow problems.", "NTA. Lots of moochers want to split the check when they know they are going to get a good deal and not have to pay. Splitting the check makes sense when everyone has similar meals. Otherwise separate checks are much more reasonable.", "NTA. If they get mad at you over it, they just wanted your $$$.", "NTA I don't drink and get full easily so my friends know I will not be paying for the drinks, appetizers and expensive main courses they order. It's a little awkward when you start but people get used to it.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even have to be about them eating more than you. It\u2019s just unfair because not all dishes are priced the same, and if they order a drink and you dont then that\u2019s unfair to you. In any case, it\u2019s not exactly anything insulting if you suggest to pay for your own bills separately. Just tell them you\u2019re on a budget and want to manage your finances more responsibly.", "NTA.

Insisting on splitting the bill equally is a dick move.", "NTA but I would be honest and say that I\u2019m not subsidizing you.", "NTA - I detest splitting evenly for bills unless it\u2019s just two of us and we openly shared plates. It\u2019s completely rude and unnecessary, and ignores potentially disproportionate budgets when it comes to dining out. When I was younger I definitely had moments where I simply could not afford anything but bare minimum (i.e. water and a small plate) and would have friends ordering entrees, mains and desserts with cocktails. Splitting the bill would have sent me into an overdraft - and that\u2019s embarrassing to have to openly discuss!

You all each ate your own respective meals and they want to split the bill? What is there to split?

Next time, be upfront when ordering: tell the server that you're on a separate check.

It saved me a ton of money and arguments.", "NTA. Use your words. If this is a place with waiter service, tell the waiter that you'd like your own separate bill before you even order.", "NTA all i had to read was the title. i mean it\u2019s fair if u just pay for what YOU ordered like you could have been ordering chicken tenders with french fries and ur friends are ordering like steaks and lobster which isn\u2019t fair to split the bill on for something you didnt eat/indulge in. NTA", "NTA. Ive had people do me dirty by ordering food and DRINKS and then splitting with my sober ass. Completely inappropriate.", "NTA but be upfront and tell these friends that paying for your smaller meals yourself is more in your budget. If they argue tell them they must have noticed you order smaller portions / meals and don't understand why it is fair to you to pay for a portion of their larger meals. \n\nYou could turn the tables and order a larger meal then take home a large portion of your plate for a couple lunches.", "NTA for not wanting to subsidize others' meals. Your execution needs improvement.  Easiest and clearest way to handle these situations is to be upfront from the start and inform your waiter that your bill will be separate when you place your order.", "NTA\n\nBut stop allowing around the issue and just be blunt - 'I was not planning on spending as much as you guys, so I will just pay my share separately'.\n\nThe reasonable people will understand, the moochers and the assholes will take issue and can easily be ignored.", "NTA. But this is becoming one of the most annoying tropes on this sub. There was a popular post about this same thing. yesterday. \n\nNo one should be subsidizing any one else's food or drinks, unless of course you are feeling charitable. If your friends demand you to subsidize their lifestyle, then you need better friends.", "NTA, but is it worth it to be 'sneaky' like this as opposed to just telling your friends you'd prefer to simply order, and pay, for your own meals?\n\nIf there's some social expectation that people dining together communally split the cost of everyone's meal, it *might* be an AH thing to try to bypass that instead of just saying you don't want to participate in it. Being up front is always better.", "Nta. You need to forget your wallet and only have enough cash for you", "NTA. Why is this a trend? Is this done on easy going people that others feel they can take advantage of. Is the state of the education system that bad, that people can't do basic math? You are NTA for wanting to pay for what you consumed. You are an adult and are not responsible for anyone else unless you have previously stated you would pay for them.

Those sound like shit friends. I have never split the whole check when out with friends, everyone always just pays for what they ordered. It\u2018s way more complicated and inconvenient and nonsensical to split it up like that, which tells me there\u2019s only one reason they would want to do it.", "NTA. Reasonable people would not get mad about this.

Bartenders like me see this a lot, and I'm sure others who work in restaurants do too. Usually, it starts when a couple of ppl are a little low on funds, then it sort of snowballs until suddenly, the friends group has to either expand, so the check can be split among more ppl, or someone needs to bring an *angel* who is loaded or has an expense account and just magically  drops his card to treat everyone. I've seen this from both angles, and it's just best to put your foot down and pay separately even if someone offers to treat everyone (unless it's like... your birthday, maybe), and firmly establish boundaries early because otherwise it will get uncomfortable, you may lose relationships you'd rather keep, and there will be a lot of resentment either way.", "Those are not your friends.", "NTA.
