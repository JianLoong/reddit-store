While paying for some of an event like this makes sense, since not many people can pay for 20 of their friends for a weekend away, the way they drip fed what you would have to pay, and would only put the breakdown of costs into a private message rather than just the whole chat, sounds very sketchy.

It\u2019s your money and you get to know and choose how it\u2019s spent.\n\nAlso, when will we move on from extravagant and expensive events to celebrate someone getting married?

No, not really. I was adamant that mine was a max of one day and cost people no more than \u00a330 upfront\n\nAsking you for \u00a3800 (which is an absolute joke for a day at Centre Parks) without any explanation of what that money is for is super unreasonable and quite suspicious.", "NTA, \nAs fun as a bachelorette party is, expecting party goers to front up large sums is ridiculous. And bitching behind strangers backs when they ask reasonable questions is ridiculous. Honestly, they sound like a foul group of human beings. I hope the bride is nice, or I would advise you to pull out and get a refund.", "NTA.  The whole thing should have been spelled out up front, not piece-meal like they were trying to do.  It's completely reasonable to want to know how much money, just so it can be budgeted.    \n\n\nThey've got to be totally tone-deaf and out of touch if they're not aware that not everyone can just \"not worry about it.\"  Good grief.", "So suss.

It was like \u00a330 for me personally", "So everyone is paying for their own surprise gift which they don't know if they want to have it?", "That\u2019s tacky! The bride should pay for these out of her own pocket.", "This is not a thing, is it?!?\n\nDid they ask if you would all be up for that first?", "Ahhh, I was like \u201cI\u2019d expect a week in Champneys for that\u2019\u201d\n\nI think you might need to clarify that was for the whole group, not each.\n\nBut even so, tell me what the money\u2019s for!", "Basically...", "If that's true, is it even a gift if they technically paid for it themseves?", "To be fair don't think the bride knows she isn't in the group... but I think calling it a gift but expecting attendees to pay for it without being upfront that that's what the money is for is a bit weird.\n\nI see lots of \"oh my god this is so thoughtful and lovely! Thank you MoH and Cheifbridesmaid for getting us this\" when really they've just used our money to buy us \"gifts\".", "Nope... part of their original explanation for the money was \"fun suprises\" so I guess it's that", "Haha yeah that was all I wanted was to know what it was for but because only a few of us were questioning + the attitude of the mother of the bride  I was like am I being unreasonable for asking and potentially ruining the fun? Does it seem like I'm questioning the integrity of the organisers? I just wanted to know what it was for!", "I think that's not a gift. Is something you should offer that everyone can order if it is a necessary item. A gift should be paid by the person who would like to gift it. Maybe it's to expensive, than choose something different.\n\nEdit: why did nobody write the breakdown in the group? Maybe it's different for every person?\n\u00a340 pP just for the \"gift\"?!", "No, imho", "Yeah. That would tick me right off\u2026 it seems very odd\u2026 say, you want to get your own gift.", "Yeah, sorry, but that\u2019s all kinds of wrong. I think you should be very careful when planning if you\u2019re expecting other people to pay for it.", "Sounds like they\u2019re planning what they want and getting everyone to pay for it. How much are they paying?", "I've started referring to it as a souvenir, it's a gift I'm buying myself.", "I'm gonna assume the same amount. One of them suggested that our contribution would cover some but not all costs for the fun activities and stuff.", "I don\u2019t understand why can\u2019t they openly share in the group costs and show receipts and be transparent.
