That kid was not going to stop until they got bored after a million throws or someone took the item away.\n\nAnd most parents will know the parenting technique implemented with kids who throw things for fun - Don't pick it up! Sometimes they get upset about it, but they're just going to think it's a fine game if you keep participating. (If I were that parent, the first thing I'd have said after the kids chucked the toy would be \"you can't throw your toys on the plane. If you throw it again, I'm putting it away and you won't get it back until after we land\" and yes you might have to deal with some crying if they have to face the consequences but that's how it goes. They won't throw the toy next flight and they will take you seriously).\n\nYou did exactly the right thing OP. Kids do get upset sometimes if they can't have their way. But parents should be used to dealing with that and comforting the kid without letting the behaviour continue.

I have flown with a 7, 5 and 3 year old by myself a few times and this would never happen.", "NTA. \nYou only have to put up w so much. 5/6 yrs old seems pretty old for that.\nMom didn\u2019t prepare well, it sounds like.\nI\u2019m not a big fan of electronic babysitters, but kid could have had a book on tape, if they weren\u2019t reading yet.\n\nAlso, I feel like you do whatever you can to have a nice flight, it\u2019s your obligation to your fellow passengers.", "NTA first time was being a kid. after that point mum should have done what parents do and found some other way to entertain the kid. \n\nTravelling with kids i use up all my cabin luggage with things to keep them calm and occupied. its my job to keep them from causing issues for other.", "NTA\n\nI have kids and have flown with them on planes. My youngest was 2. Your friends with kids are correct that there are certain things you can\u2019t control about kids, and that\u2019s a fact of life. But you are \ud83d\udcaf correct that this could was old enough to know better and this parent was passing her responsibilities off to you. \n\nSo many people hate kids because of parents like this. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA she is entitled and a huge AH. No wonder her kid is also a little shit", "NTA.  If the child was an infant too young to understand  I would have some sympathy for the mom, but I have a toddler (2.5) and a 6 year old and I wouldn't have let either one continuously throw something at a stranger and then expect them to help me.  And 5/6 years old?!  Way too old unless there's a developmental disorder in play.  I would have done what you did and tell my child if it was thrown again, it wasn't coming back.  And yeah, as others have said - just give the kid a screen and a snack on a flight and make everyone's life easy.  This is why I haven't flown with my kids, because they're hyper and I can't imagine subjecting myself and others to the chaos.  They're probably just now old enough that we would attempt it.", "NTA. What makes the mother especially unreasonable was that this was not a toddler. The child was 5 or 6 and old enough to understand.", "You are a lot nicer, I would've ripped the toy and told the kid to shut up", "NTA. Five or 6 years old is old enough for the child to understand that he can't do that.", "NTA of said child was 2 or 3 it be different and assuming no reasons (development delays for one of the million reasons) then a 5 or 6 year old is capable of understanding if I throw this over there I won't get it back.", "If the kid was a two year old, tossing toys happens, annoys people, and is developmentally expected, as long as parents are trying to teach the child not to do it. If this kid was 4-5, its parent is responsible. One tossed toy happens, the second toss gets a hand back with a \u201cDo not throw this toy again\u201d to the child while giving the parent a stern look. The third time, I\u2019d hold the toy and call the flight attendant to deal with it. A kid that age knows better.", "I'm sure passengers aren't supposed to rummage round on the ground looking for things anyway. That's why the video at the start of the flight tells you to call an attendant to help if you drop your phone or similar. NTA.", "NTA. I have four kids and I would have been mortified and apologetic after the first time, especially on a plane.  Second time and that toy is definitely gone.  There is no excuse for inflicting your kids on others.", "NTA. I hate, hate, hate parents like that. Neither you nor anyone is responsible for her kid but her. She was warned after the THIRD time of her kid throwing the toy you wouldn't get it for her. She ignored you. She made it more difficult for herself and everyone else by not minding her kid.", "The hell? How is this is a question? Of course you\u2019re NTA. It sounds like the mom wants you to stay awake to be on duty as her personal toy fetcher. She\u2019s insane.", "NTA. It\u2019s not you responsibility to keep getting the toy for the kid. I would understand if the kid was a 1 or 2 years old. But at 5 or 6 they\u2019re able to understand not to throw any kind of toys specially in a airplane unless the child has special needs.", "NTA. 3 strikes and you're out.", "You did the right thing OP, that mom needs to instill some discipline in her child and apparently she expects everyone in the vicinity to enable his shitty behavior\u2026.uuuuh no\nSo glad I don\u2019t have children btw \ud83e\udd23", "\u201cGet fucked lady\u201d is a perfectly appropriate reply.", "NTA.\nMom of a 4 year and 9 year old.\n\nI would never let my child throw a toy over the seat. If 4 did it once, I would apologize and give one more chance. A second toss would immediately result in the toy being put away.", "NTA.  Your flight experience shouldn't be impacted by someone else's kid.  Sometimes it can't be helped, kids cry, the change in air pressure hurts their ears etc.  But a parent can control kids throwing stuff, by taking the stuff away.  It's not your job to make her flight more comfortable but making yourself less comfortable.", "NTA\u2026 dear parents the world is not ur babysitter and ppl without kids are not required to cater to those who do. Yes it\u2019s nice to be nice but obviously the mother didn\u2019t want to be nice so why shld OP b uncomfortable for their sake?", "NTA, the kid was 5, not 2!!! At that age, they should know not to throw stuff! Heck, when my 1,5 old girls throw stuff down the table, I pick it up ONCE. After that, its on them and if they start a tantrum, toy is removed.", "Nta", ">the mom started to lecture me in line\n\n\"Not my fault you're unable to control your kid.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I have 3 kids and if they're being little dicks, I'll apologize even if it's age appropriate behavior. It's just the courteous thing to do when you inconvenience other people. It's our duty as a parent to try to keep our kids behaved in certain environments, esp an older kid who should be able to grasp what's publicly acceptable behavior", " NTA. She\u2019s a crappy parent", "NTA - you should patience and you gave fair warning. She was being entitled.", "NTA the first time I flew with my baby (long haul, two 12-hour flights back to back) I walked up and down the aisle nonstop for eight hours holding him when he would not settle because I was so concerned about him crying and driving the other passengers crazy. My kid, my responsibility.", "NTA the first time I flew with my baby (long haul, two 12-hour flights back to back) I walked up and down the aisle nonstop for eight hours holding him when he would not settle because I was so concerned about him crying and driving the other passengers crazy. My kid, my responsibility.", "ESH. \n\nYou could have done the same thing without making it a teachable moment. Just stop picking it up without warning her if your actions- that\u2019s where it became a power play instead of just learning to live with you not jumping to get it. \n\nYou telling her what you did, made her kid curious to see how it would shake out if he kept doing that thing that has everyone on edge. He probably tests her all the time in public and she is tired of it too.", "NTA I have a kids and I would not tolerate them throwing objects at people.", "Accurate.", "\u201cIt takes a village\u201d is not bs. \u201cI\u2019m entitled to conscript you into my village\u201d is complete bs.", "You're absolutely right. In our house, we flat out refused to play the game we called \"Mommy/Daddy Fetch.\"", "When mine were little I called it \"the daddy dumb#\\*s game\", but only when it was a bottle of pacifier or something similar. Not toys. They did it just to see if I would keep picking it up and I would a couple of times just to be sure it wasn't an accident. This absolutely did not last til 5-6 years old though. This was when they were toddlers and figuring out boundaries.", "Exactly. 5-6 is much older than this behavior usually lasts if the parents don\u2019t indulge it. Even with a baby as young as 9 mo, once is an accident, twice is a test, three times and now it is a game and we are done, kid doesn\u2019t get the thing back. That is Parenting 101.", "Haha yes!", "This is why my friends' kids got small toys that a string could easily be added to. Now, they weren't throwing it over the seat and annoying someone else, but they had the life line in case it went under the seat further than they could get.", "Absolutely love me some Bluey and Bingo!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "thats a job for yer MOMMY", "Oh no, really? My niece's behaviour changed almost the day she turned 2, it was uncanny. My sister was like \"oh she's not going to have the terrible twos, she's such a good girl\" but literally within a week of turning 2 she had her first tantrum and has only been perfecting the art since lol. I hope she doesn't get worse! (She's still a very sweet little girl but she's definitely in a testing boundaries stage!)", "Such a good vocabulary! Much wow!", "Why are you assuming I haven't? I have nieces. I love my nieces and as long as they're not puking or pooping, I was totally happy to hold them whenever and I wish I could've held them more, even when they were screaming. \n\nI still don't understand why you think OP should have entertained the tantrum then when they a) didn't want to get hit over and over by a toy (even a soft, harmless toy) and b) wanted to sleep on the plane. They didn't do anything wrong at all, you just seem quite entitled to think people should help you with your kids. I know it takes a village and all but you have no idea if the other person needs their village at that moment."]}
