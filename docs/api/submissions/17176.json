A mother and child were sat behind me, and from the start of the fight, her kid (about 5 or 6 years old) kept throwing his toy over my seat and into the space in front of me. \n\nThe first two times, I picked it up and gave it back to the kid. The third time, I kindly asked the mother to stop her kid from throwing it over. It was a total nuisance, and he actually hit me on the head the second time. \n\nShe rolled her eyes at me and told me that her kid was just acting like a kid. I told her that if he did it again then I wouldn't pick it up. \n\nLo and behold, he threw it over a fourth time and this time I totally ignored the toy. I put on headphones and just pretended I didn't notice. The mom  tried to get my attention, but I pretended to sleep. Within several minutes the kid started to wail and freak out. \n\nThe mom ended up having to call a flight attendant over to get the toy. Her kid did it again, but because it took a while for the flight attendant to get there both times and the kid was wigging out while waiting for the toy, I heard the mom finally put the toy away and she gave her son an iPad (which he didn't throw...). \n\nAnyways, after the fight, the mom started to lecture me in line, saying that I was an AH for making the flight so difficult for her and her kid. I told her that she's responsible for her kid, and that I wasn't a babysitter or a butler, and she was the rude one to expect me to keep picking up her kid's toy (plus, I actually went to sleep at one point, so I don't know what she expected). \n\nOne of my friends has kids though, and she thought I was being unreasonable, so I'm not sure anymore. I can be honest and say that I don't have kids. I understand it's difficult traveling with them, but I've never experienced it myself, so I'm not sure if I was an AH or not.", "created_utc": 1684032146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h0bv7/aita_for_not_helping_a_mom_pick_up_a_toy_for_her/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Parenting is hard, but she doesn't get to stop doing it because she's on a plane.", "NTA - I don't even know if I'd have handed it back the second time and I probably would have asked the flight attendant to ask her to put it away when they came over to pick it up for the mom. You're more tolerant and patient than me. They aren't your kids or your responsibility. Sorry you had to deal with this crap on your flight", "NTA. She fully expected other people to help her parent her child. She should've given him the toys she knew he wouldn't throw instead.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like the woman and your friend are entitled parents. Having a child on a plane can be incredibly stressful for a parent, no doubt... but you weren't being one of those people that are rude/antagonistic toward children. You just did your own thing and didn't pick on some of the childcare needs of a total stranger. That is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA.  Unless the mum apologised and explained if her son was ND then she was expecting a stranger to be her servant.  She even called a steward instead of getting off her ass herself.  Totally entitled.  I would have thrown it away.  Also at 6 kids should be taught no is no and know how to behave.", "NTA, this not your kid, is hers, there is nothing wrong on helping her the first time, bout she may not expect for you to keep helping her to do HER job.", " NTA once or twice but not thrice.", "NTA, why didn\u2019t she give the kid the iPad in the first place? Just because she\u2019s a mom doesn\u2019t mean she get special privileges (beyond common courtesy) to do whatever she and her kid want.", "NTA.  Please tell your friends that they are wrong! Parents like the one you encountered are bad parents. The kid maybe acting like a kid, but being a parent means actually parenting their child. Teaching them right from wrong and that  includes teaching the child not to throw things, teaching them consequences and when in a plane - keeping their child occupied!  You did nothing wrong!!!", "NTA A 5 year can be expected not to throw stuff or she should not have taken the kid on a plane. This is just another parenting fail.", "I do have kids. That mother was completely out of line.\n\nNTA", "INFO: how old was the kid?\n\nLess than 3 NAH mom is barely surviving \nOlder than 3 NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
