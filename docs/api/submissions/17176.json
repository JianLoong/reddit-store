Endlessly throwing a toy might feel like a game for the child, but noticing that they have hurt somebody the mother needed to put a stop to the situation. \n\nI feel like people always use \"is just a kid\" to try and get away with all the shitty things their children do so they don't have to actually step up and do the parenting thing they claim they love so much yet they avoid doing.", "I thought this was going to be about refusing to pick it up once. 4th time?

That is one lazy entitled asshole parent", "Hopping on the top comment to say: I have young kids and I can say with 99% certainty that as soon as that kid threw a toy and saw someone give it back, it became a game to them. That kid was not going to stop until they got bored after a million throws or someone took the item away.\n\nAnd most parents will know the parenting technique implemented with kids who throw things for fun - Don't pick it up! Sometimes they get upset about it, but they're just going to think it's a fine game if you keep participating. (If I were that parent, the first thing I'd have said after the kids chucked the toy would be \"you can't throw your toys on the plane. If you throw it again, I'm putting it away and you won't get it back until after we land\" and yes you might have to deal with some crying if they have to face the consequences but that's how it goes. They won't throw the toy next flight and they will take you seriously).\n\nYou did exactly the right thing OP. Kids do get upset sometimes if they can't have their way. But parents should be used to dealing with that and comforting the kid without letting the behaviour continue. It's literally one of the more frequent things you have to do as a parent if young children. And it seems like she was able to distract/comfort the kid and he wasn't upset for too long.", "This. I have a 3 year old and I'd she was doing this, the toy would have been put away after the 2nd time it went over. OP, you're NTA.", "I would have taken the toy away after the second time - two times is no accident. (Maybe after the first. Don\u2019t know, because my kids knows toys get put away if she throws them when she\u2019s not outside, she will not throw them when she\u2019s not outside.)", "Even if they are younger than three the toy gets put away when it's thrown deliberately. It's the way we taught our kids not to throw toys out the pram. At 5 it actually ridiculous behaviour.", "Well considering she called a flight attendant over to get it the last time as well instead of getting the toy herself just shows what a self-entitled woman she is. \n\nOP definitely NTA", "100% agree my child would have lost the toy on the third throw", "My ex did this when his 28 month old daughter threw her dummy twice while we were at the Olympics. Lol. Ffs. Second time she did it. He refused to give it back to her. Dealt with the meltdown outside the stadium and she never had a dummy again. Done kid. Don\u2019t throw your things into a crowd. \n\nAt the time I thought it was not a good decision. I also don\u2019t have kids. \n\nNow I\u2019m older I see he made the best decision and was acting like a proper parent", "Totes. Maybe take it away the first time for a kid who should know better. For a younger/less taught kids, warn them the first time and take it away if it happens again. I would never let my kids chuck stuff around an indoor space with strangers in it, and my kids are only 3. I'm aware it would be annoying af for everyone and possibly cause hurt/damage.\n\nIt's literally the parents job to teach children how to behave in public. The kids can't possibly know the \"rules\" and it's cruel not to teach them cos they quickly grow up to be arseholes that no-one likes.", "Haha it would have been worse if she climbed into OPs row to get the toy.", "It\u2019s also cruel because kids have an innate desire to do the right thing and to fit in. We\u2019re social animals, so we should help them behave so that they\u2019re accepted in all their relevant groups."]}
