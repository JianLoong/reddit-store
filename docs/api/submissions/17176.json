That kid was not going to stop until they got bored after a million throws or someone took the item away.\n\nAnd most parents will know the parenting technique implemented with kids who throw things for fun - Don't pick it up! Sometimes they get upset about it, but they're just going to think it's a fine game if you keep participating. (If I were that parent, the first thing I'd have said after the kids chucked the toy would be \"you can't throw your toys on the plane. If you throw it again, I'm putting it away and you won't get it back until after we land\" and yes you might have to deal with some crying if they have to face the consequences but that's how it goes. They won't throw the toy next flight and they will take you seriously).\n\nYou did exactly the right thing OP. Kids do get upset sometimes if they can't have their way. But parents should be used to dealing with that and comforting the kid without letting the behaviour continue.

You were right to put on headphones and ignore them. You are responsible for keeping anyone\u2019s child happy on your flight. That is why this child has parents", "*one of your friends is \u201can entitled parent though\u201d.. NTA by any metric.", "Nta, I'm a parent and I have a one strike and the toy doesn't come back if she throws it", "NTA. Kids will behave like kids every now and again, but that's the parents' responsibility. Picking something up for them is nice, bit can't be expected.", "NTA I have kids and have never let my kids throw toys around in a plane or restaurant. That was rude of the mom to expect you to fetch her kid\u2019s toy.", "Nah you were fine, id have picked the toy up and thrown it further", "NTA- while I\u2019m sure it was stressful for her, she could and should have planned better.", "I think you are a saint for picking it up the second time! NTA", "I have kids, I would have told her to fuck off away from me with her demon child. NTA.", "NTA.", ">she thought I was being unreasonable\n\nOf course a parent would say that. There's something about being a parent that makes people become more entitled, whether they mean to or not.  \n\n\nYou're definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'd have done the same thing.", "That's how kids act and it's okay as long as it doesn't affect others. This was clearly disturbing other people. It's annoying when parents don't control their kids and allow then to annoy others but what's worse is that she lectured you wtf. \n\nNot sure if this belongs here but I'll just share it. So there's this kid that was at the park who I knew. He wasn't really one of those normal kids( he had mild autism or something like that can't fully recall). His sister was there at the park once and when the kid was talking to others they got annoyed and they told him to get lost. I tried to stop them as I knew that his parents and sister had it hard and that they were doing a good job taking care of him. They said his sister there was not even doing anything. I didn't feel that it was fair for them to say this especially this one guy as I knew that if he had a brother like that he probably wouldn't even treat him well. \n\nThere are some situations where parents might just be too tired looking after their kids. However this situation was not really your fault as you started off nice. It would have been more appropriate for her to try and stop her kid from throwing the toy or she could've apologised to come off as decent.", "I was thinking you ignored the toy from the get go and was ready to call you the AH. \n\nPicked it up twice and a polite request for it to stop to the mom? No, you\u2019re NTA. I guess she was fine to be inwardly annoyed? But to then bring it up again AFTER the flight? No wayyyy, that\u2019s not on.", "NTA. I think you handled it well by pretending to sleep and trying to avoid confrontation. Also nice of you to touch it not knowing if they were sick or what. I get it might of been out of the mom\u2019s control a bit too, but it seems like the iPad was fine and she was just agitating everything by giving him the toy again and again. I\u2019m a mom and wouldn\u2019t let my kid bother a stranger to this extent.", "NTA. What, is she expecting you to pick up after her kid the whole flight? She should be apologising to you for disturbing your flight rather than calling you an A-hole.\n\nHer kid, her responsibility. Not anyone else", "NTA. How is a child at that age, getting away with it? They\u2019re not a toddler, even so they wouldn\u2019t at this age either. At 5 or 6, they are old enough to know they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. I know kids that age that wouldn\u2019t dream of it, it\u2019s all down to the parenting. I would have taken it away the second time, whatever the age and given them something else to do. What runs through some peoples minds, seriously.", "The kid was 5 or 6, that's perfectly old enough to be told how to behave and not to disturb others. NTA", "Nta at all, I have a kid and would be mortified if I put anyone in that situation. Unfortunately the mom seems to not realize that that parenting is actually a critical point of being a parent.. sure it's not easy but it's the way to not raise spoiled, entitled AHs", "NTA.  Never fly with your friend and her kid, lol.", "NTA. I\u2019d have thrown the toy at the other end of the plane.", "NTA \n\nI have a kid and that is a nuisance if apologize for naturally. If you were rude to me I\u2019d think you\u2019re a bit of a jerk. But it doesn\u2019t sound like she even noticed and then to blame you is just too much.", "My neighbor's middle kiddo consistently throws anything he can up on my balcony.  I asked him to stop once, twice, and three times.  Then he tossed a heavy shoe up and broke a beautiful planter my mother gave me. The shoe was good trade because he was forced to tell his parents and then ask for the shoe.\n\nI thought he might stop after that. Maybe next year.\n\nNTA", "NTA - kids being kids is starting to become boys will be boys.   \n\n\nThe parent can talk to her kid and tell them they are in a public place and to behave themselves. My parents did this, my friends parents did this, my parents had parents that did this. It's not that difficult to talk to your child and get them to settle down.   \n\n\nAs someone that worked as a teacher and taught ages 3-12.....I am absolutely surprised by the amount of parents that tell me, \"You don't get it because you don't have a child.\" I have friends who have children that will tell their kids to settle down in public and be respectful....", "NTA. \n\nIf she was mortified about the behavior but didn\u2019t know how to stop it that\u2019s one thing\u2026 But. Nah. NTA ;)", "Exactly. She didn't pay op to be a babysitter for her kid. \n\nAdding to this, \n\nOp, say this to your friend who is expecting you to show empathy to that mom. This mom has an alternative (ipad) to entertain her child which won't disturb you but still chose the one (toy) that can actively disturb. That makes the whole situation different. **you don't need to be kind to a mom who purposefully disturbed you.**", "Some parenting is hard, but this bit isnt.", "NTA... once or twice was generous", "Even if her child is neurodivergent, it's a reason but not an excuse. No parent should expect other people to turn into assistant parents or to sacrifice their time and convenience for them. Whether her child is neurodivergent or not, that lady expected OP to be her servant in order to manage her child's emotions.\n\nA ND child might make me more sympathetic to her as a parent, but it wouldn't make me less annoyed at being expected to fetch and carry for a whole flight so her child would stay happy.", "sadly we rarely hear about the good ones as noone posts about 'i went to the park and there was a kid and thier parent there, the sky was blue'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts only the assholes and the exceptions that get talked about especially in places like aita", "Genuinely delusional opinion lol", "what did i just read lmao", "Lol!! Your take is delusional. There was one person on that flight responsible making the kid not wail and disturb passengers, it was the mom. There is nothing to be empathetic about here other than a parent who thinks strangers should be responsible for the comfort and well-being of their child.", "is it mean of me to think of using elastic to tie it to the kids head so when they throw they get immediate consequences :)", "That was my thought, too. It was a game because OP picked it up and gave it back. It would be one thing if OP was okay with playing but obviously, they weren't and asked the parent to have the kid stop. At that point, the mom should have put the toy away immediately. And instead of a lecture after the flight the mom should have apologized.", "The name of that game (in my house, at least) was \u201cPick it up, stupid.\u201d", "Absolutely this - the throwing/ dropping game is endless fun for toddlers, and only stops when you stop giving it back. \n\n\nNTA OP, as another toddler mum, I would have told the toddler after the first time if they threw it again it was going away for the trip, and stashed it the second time. Just get out the iPad in the first place, im all for trying for limited screen time, but on a flight is not the time for it - put some bluey on and let everyone chill out.", "I\u2019d have kicked it 5 rows down after the 3rd time. 5/6 years old is old enough to hear \u201cStop doing that please\u201d from their parent", ">28 month old daughter\n\nYou mean 2 year old.", "My daughter was allowed to be a kid as long as she wasn't imposing on others or being obnoxious.   Definitely would have taken that toy away too", ">put some bluey on\n\nYaaaas Bluey! The most superior of children's tv.", "4 months is a big difference in a little kids development that\u2019s why people say how old babies and toddlers are in months", "Borderline - at that age months still matter. 2 is different than 2 1/2, etc. They make less difference then when youngest, of course.", "Yeah that's what I meant. It's not fair to the kid not to teach them how to behave."]}
