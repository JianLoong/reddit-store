The third time, I kindly asked the mother to stop her kid from throwing it over. It was a total nuisance, and he actually hit me on the head the second time. \n\nShe rolled her eyes at me and told me that her kid was just acting like a kid. I told her that if he did it again then I wouldn't pick it up. \n\nLo and behold, he threw it over a fourth time and this time I totally ignored the toy. I put on headphones and just pretended I didn't notice. The mom  tried to get my attention, but I pretended to sleep. Within several minutes the kid started to wail and freak out. \n\nThe mom ended up having to call a flight attendant over to get the toy. Her kid did it again, but because it took a while for the flight attendant to get there both times and the kid was wigging out while waiting for the toy, I heard the mom finally put the toy away and she gave her son an iPad (which he didn't throw...). \n\nAnyways, after the fight, the mom started to lecture me in line, saying that I was an AH for making the flight so difficult for her and her kid. I told her that she's responsible for her kid, and that I wasn't a babysitter or a butler, and she was the rude one to expect me to keep picking up her kid's toy (plus, I actually went to sleep at one point, so I don't know what she expected). \n\nOne of my friends has kids though, and she thought I was being unreasonable, so I'm not sure anymore.

You're more tolerant and patient than me. They aren't your kids or your responsibility. Sorry you had to deal with this crap on your flight", "NTA. She fully expected other people to help her parent her child.

Having a child on a plane can be incredibly stressful for a parent, no doubt... but you weren't being one of those people that are rude/antagonistic toward children. You just did your own thing and didn't pick on some of the childcare needs of a total stranger. That is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA.  Unless the mum apologised and explained if her son was ND then she was expecting a stranger to be her servant.  She even called a steward instead of getting off her ass herself.  Totally entitled.  I would have thrown it away.

Parents like the one you encountered are bad parents. The kid maybe acting like a kid, but being a parent means actually parenting their child. Teaching them right from wrong and that  includes teaching the child not to throw things, teaching them consequences and when in a plane - keeping their child occupied!  You did nothing wrong!!!", "NTA A 5 year can be expected not to throw stuff or she should not have taken the kid on a plane. This is just another parenting fail.", "I do have kids.

I am a mom, and if mine did that, I would be very apologetic!  I am responsible for my kid. Her child obviously saw it as a game and she enabled. But to mention I would definitely be proactive on that, because airplane floors, like any public floors, are so dirty\ud83e\udd2e", "NTA.  You made the flight difficult for her?  Her lack of parenting skills made it difficult for her.  Her choice to ignore your warning made it difficult for her.  She is rude and entitled.", "NTA. It's not your job to pick up after her kid. It's on her to keep her child calm and occupied during a flight.", "besides that, you even asked her to make the kid stop, so i don't know what she wanted from you", "1st can be an accident.\n\n2nd is intentional.\n\n3rd is a war crime.\n\nNTA.

She just mouthed he's a kid at you and didn't tell him to stop. You went to sleep.

I really hate when people with kids thibk they're entitled to everyone catering to theor needs because they're kids", "NTA... once or twice was generous", "NTA. Planes are public spaces and it\u2019s the parents job to make sure their kids are being respectful of everyone in it. You told her the clear consequences of her actions and followed through. That\u2019s on her. Your friend with kids sounds entitled too if they think you were in the wrong.", "NTA at all, if that was my kid if they threw it twice the toy would be put away, I would be pretty embarrassed.", "NTA. And don't listen to your friend who called you \"unreasonable\". You tolerated shite behaviour from that mother more than you really had to.\n\nI'd have kicked that toy 3 rows down. Oops.", "NTA. Once the toy hit you, it became a nuisance for everyone else and her failure to control her child is on her. When she stated lecturing you about making the flight difficult for her, you should have turned and said that her inability to control her child made the flight difficult for you, especially after the child hit you with their toy however unintentional it may have been. It is always on the parent to control their child, not the people around them.", "NTA. The drop the toy and pick it up game is tedious when you ARE responsible for the kid. And it usually comes with less danger...", "Nta. \n\nIf kid is 5-6 is old enough to understand basic concept of consequences. Mother should be parenting and prepare the best she could for the flight boredom of her kid.", "NTA. I\u2019m the a mom of multiple kids that have all been on flights. If something gets thrown I\u2019m immediately apologizing and putting whatever it was away. I\u2019ve had a child throw something on one flight ever and he was under 2. 5-6 is too old to be behaving that way. That age they are more than capable of being told expectations for the flight and following them.", "NTA. It\u2019s a game for the kid, but you don\u2019t have to play it. One time we went to the zoo with my sister, her friend, and her friend\u2019s kid, and the kid would drop something and I would say \u201cuh-oh\u201d and pick it up (I had seen the mom do this earlier too). Then the kid started dropping stuff and saying \u201cuh-oh\u201d and giggling. He never did it with anything important or that would spill, just toys. It was adorable & I didn\u2019t mind playing along for an afternoon. \n\nBut that\u2019s an entirely different situation than a kid you DON\u2019T KNOW throwing stuff AT YOU on a plane, and you\u2019re not obligated to play along.", "nta i hate when they give them toys like that. my parenting choice is to put a string on the toys and it tied to the kids so the kids could pull them back", ">I told her that she's responsible for her kid, and that I wasn't a babysitter or a butler, and she was the rude one to expect me to keep picking up her kid's toy\n\nSpot on. As a parent myself, it's my job (and my wife's) to babysit our kid, not the rest of the world's. You were a decent human being to pick up the toy for the times you did, but sure as hell ain't your job to continuously do it while she sits back and does nothing. Good on you for setting her straight and actually making her be a parent. NTA", "Notice how the mother put the toy away when the situation became a nuisance for her? She knew how to resolve the problem but choose to make it OP's problem. The entitlement is strong in that mother.  OP is definitely NTA.", "OP says 5 or 6 in the post", "Absolutely this! Could have saved all the drama and annoyance for OP if she\u2019d just given the kid the iPad from the start. I\u2019m not exactly a fan of giving kids screens all the time, but on a flight where the alternative is that he\u2019s an absolute nuisance to strangers? Give the kid the darn iPad. Lady was lucky OP was so accommodating at all, I\u2019ve seen so many people fly off the absolute handle at kids acting up and getting in their space on flights I wouldn\u2019t take the risk of the stranger next to the kid who gets hit by flying toys yelling at my kid or worse. To expect said stranger to repeatedly pick up after said annoying kid? No way! That\u2019s entitlement and negligence to the point of possibly exposing your kid to risk.\n\nFlying brings out the worst in everyone, OP was way more patient than many."]}
