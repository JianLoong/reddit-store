Had this been literally any other day I'd be on your side, but not on her birthday.", "YTA you're possibly concentrating so much on Ellie because of her sickness that you don't even realise how much you are neglecting Maya. The only times you notice it is when she tries to catch your attention.\n\nAt least that's the interpretation I see here.", "YTA.\n\nI can guarantee that Maya is not an attention seeker - I think anyone with a brain can see that she would have been getting a lot less care and attention than she needs and deserves at a bare minimum just for being alive and being her parents' child.\n\nI bet Maya had been looking forward to her birthday for so long knowing that she would be able to feel like the most special person in her family *for once,* which is absolutely fair and understandable. your brother took that away from her, which also means he is an asshole, and when she, understandably, got upset, you - instead of reacting with compassion - belittled and insulted her. \n\nthere is ONE day a year where it's her birthday, and 364 others on which your brother could have made his announcement. \n\nyou were harsh, insensitive, and downright rude to *a child* who was having a difficult moment and who deserved your respect and compassion. apologise and do better.", "YTA. The only relevant info here is it was Maya\u2019s birthday, not Ellie\u2019s. And I\u2019m not going to lie, I think Ellie may be an attention seeker, too.

In the same way that a meth addict who already has the meth is a lot more pleasant to be around than a meth addict that doesn\u2019t have any.", "YTA and I would say with confidence that Maya is not an attention seeking child.

Being a teenage child, Maya responded how most teenagers do when they are neglected over a significant period of time: acting out.\n\nBut this wasn't an incident of her acting out. This was her birthday celebration. Once again she was neglected so everyone could focus on Ellie. And Maya snapped. Understandable and quite right. You owe Maya a massive apology.

That is awesome, and news like that should be shared.  If birthday girl can't handle the few moments of not being in the spotlight,  then tough.  \n\nI understand that it's probably been rough for birthday girl being second after all the attention surrounding her sister and the cancer diagnosis, but that's life and the sooner she makes her peace with that the better off she'll be. \n\nSo I am now prepared for all of the shitty comments to follow...", "YTA.\n\nIf there is **one** night where it's reasonable for Maya to be the center of attention, it's her birthday! Of course, it's awesome news that Ellie is cancer free. It's even reasonable for her to be the center of attention for a few minutes. Perhaps if you'd said, \"You will survive not being the center of attention for five minutes,\" that would have been more reasonable. And then help turn the focus back on her because it's her fucking birthday!", "YTA A family knows as soon as a child is in remission. I\u2019m sure Maya has missed out on a lot having a sibling so close in age (through no fault of Ellie\u2019s, who is probably more reticent because she has had to spend time in isolation). \n\nYou attacked a 15 year old on what was probably a rare occasion when she IS the center of attention and she can be so guilt free with her family worry free. Her own mother agreed that you went too far. Mind your own business.", "ESH except for Maya/bday girl. Your brother sucks most because someone\u2019s bday party is obviously the wrong time to reveal that kind of news to the whole party. Ellie sucks for bringing up being cancer free on her sister\u2019s bday which definitely seems intentional. You OP suck for snapping at a child for wanting attention when it\u2019s likely Maya has been neglected and abandoned and thus, has to be the center of attention for ANY attention. Poor girl, hope she has someone trustworthy in her life since it sounds like none of you are.", "YTA\n\nWay to bully a teenager who had her birthday party become about someone else.", "YTA\n\nWhy didn't your brother know? He's her father. Did Ellie and her mother intentionally wait until the party? I mean who gets test results at night. \nI can see he wasn't thinking and wanted to share the good news but you were a complete AH. \nBetting Maya \"the attention seeker\" has had to do that since everyone was focused on Ellie and her illness. We see it here a lot, healthy sibling ignored just trying to get their parents to notice them.\n\nBTW, any relationship you have with Maya is toast.She is not going to forget this.", "It seems like your family's neglecting Maya and ignoring her achievements.

YTA", "INFO: so ellie is cancer-free - which is *huge* news, but none of you knew about it? She just said it in passing to her uncle at a party? Her parents didn't shout that great news from the rooftops as soon as they knew? Not buying this...", "Holy shit YTA, as is your brother. The announcement could have waited.\n\nThis was Maya's day. This was her *birthday* and she invited people to celebrate her.\n\nThe fact that Ellie is cancer-free is great, fantastic, fuckin amazing and I hope she gets to live her best fucking life because goddamn does she deserve it, but do you have *any* idea what it's like to have to fight for attention because your sibling is the constant focus of the family?\n\nThis is not a problem Ellie caused, Ellie is not at fault but there is obviously resentment there because Maya has not been seen as a direct result of her sister's illness.\n\nShe has had to fight for scraps of care while her sister no doubt feels *incredibly* guilty for causing Maya to essentially be relegated to the sidelines.\n\nApologise to your niece. Tell her you were thoughtless and *cruel* and you did not realise that *she was also hurting*.\n\nDo you not think Maya has been terrified? Worried about her sister? Constantly trying to balance that with the fact that her needs are not being met and she doesn't feel seen, heard or validated?\n\nJesus fucking christ. Imagine being a whole adult and not seeing this. Embarrassing.", "I feel you might benefit from acknowledging your inherent bias here. Ellie has gone through so much, you\u2019re naturally protective of her. I\u2019m sure you - and all adults in her life - treat her as though she\u2019s special, important, especially worthy of your time. And I get it, you should. But to Maya, a young girl with little life experience, she probably constantly feels less than. She likely acts out because of that, attempting to get the attention she feels she\u2019s missing. Instead of coming down on her (you write like you hate her tbh), acknowledge her age and that she\u2019s unaware of how her actions come off/their repercussions. She\u2019s not some evil mastermind; she\u2019s a young girl presented with her own unique challenges stemming from her sister having cancer. It\u2019s a lot for anyone, but especially for someone young. Maybe have a little more compassion. Think about the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the behavior and address that instead of punishing the manifestation. YTA for now. I hope things get better soon for all of you.", "Stay out of teen sibling rivalries. (And while I understand how excited you all were at Ellie's good news - Maya was right about the part where it was her birthday party.)\n\nI am impatient with attention seeking people myself, so I understand you. But, if Ellie has been ill for a long time as you say, its not unreasonable to expect that the focus is typically on her and not Maya? Its a difficult dynamic for young people to navigate, is all I'm saying. Not selfish. Just other worldly different if you're a kid in a family that has another child who is unwell.\n\nMy cousin's son spent 99.9% of his life helping to manage his little sister's illness. He never  complained or asked people to consider he was a kid in the family too. But, had he been different - no one would have blamed him, or judged him as having a failing character.\n\nI don't blame your niece for being angry and bitter towards you.  You should not have said anything so nasty to her. You don't really know what its like to be her, after all? Soft YTA for dumping that on her. Use some of your compassion to consider she's a teenager who is growing up with a sibling who usually because of circumstances IS ALWAYS the one who gets the most attention.", "YTA - oh sure - Ellie is really shy and does not want attention\u2026 wow you dumb. Sounds like Maya is actually starved for attention!", "YTA. Why are you disconnecting Maya's need for attention from Ellie's years of getting all the attention? This has been the way it's gone for Maya through much of her childhood and early teen years. And you berate Maya on one day that could be all about her.", "YTA\n\nDuring Ellys sickness, Maya might have felt a bit neglected as usually all attention goes to the sick sibling in these situations. This can be very hurtful to kids and teenagers. Sometimes the child/teenager that feels neglected will try to find ways to get attention. They look like attention seekers but are usually just trying to find validation that they too are important. \n\nOn this particular day it was Mayas birthday party, meaning that by default she was supposed to be the center of attention. You should apologize to the birthday girl. Not only did the attention turn elsewhere at her party, you had to bring her down even more.", "YTA. It was her party. She had the right to be the center of attention. And I suspect that Ellie has been getting a lot of attention for her illness. Maya wanted this to be her night. Ellie could have announced this another time.", "YTA. Maya has been dealing with all the attention going to her sister as she battled cancer. And while her sister deserved all the attention as she\u2019s fighting for her life, this was Maya\u2019s day. This was her birthday she threw herself a party to celebrate and it was ruined by her sister\u2019s announcement. Now am I happy your other niece is cancer free absolutely. But she could\u2019ve announced it any other time, but instead took the attention away from her sister. You owe your niece an apology.", "YTA. Even just reading this I can see that Ellie tried to steal Maya's attention on her birthday, at her party. Ellie has been fighting cancer, and has been getting the entire family's concern and attention all along. Being cancer free is a great thing, but I doubt it was a sudden surprise. She planned the timing of her announcement, ffs.\n\nI'm sure ELLIE could survive not being the center of attention for one night on someone else's birthday.\n\nEDIT to add: the whole family is included in this judgement. Maya would never have to \"seek attention\" if anyone actually gave her any consideration.", "ESH everyone except Maya are asshole . Ellis could have choose any other day to tell people she was cancer free but she choose her sister birthday to do it that's suspicious \ud83e\udd14 and the brother was a down right dumbass to announce it like that and you was a mean bullying dumbass for saying what you said to a literal 14 yr old child who had her birthday hijacked", "Dude YTA.  I think Ellie specifically chose her sisters birthday party to steal the spotlight.   If it great she's cancer free?  Yes.  Could she have waited ONE DAY?  YES.  I know someone who was in a similar situation.  His sister was seriously sick and ALL attention was heaped on the sister and he was often left out and forgotten.

Maya literally does have only 1 day a year that she can hope to get more attention than her older sister. \n\nYou don't make big announcements during someone else's event.", "YTA Being the sister of a cancer patient, Maya most likely was used to most of the attention of her parents and family going to her sister (despite of your assumptions). This was her birthday. Your brother should not have picked this moment to make a big announcement about Ellie. He should have done that before the party. I understand that your brothers announcement at her party was upsetting for a 14 year old longing for some attention from her loved ones. You should not have gotten mad at her.", "Dude it\u2019s her bday the one day she is supposed to be the centre of attention.

Is that a bad thing?", "You seem biased to begin with, ngl", "YTA a bit but your brother is the real AH\n\nMaya might be an attention seeker, but have you ever thought why??

Also, you mention Maya always displaying attention seeking behavior? What does that usually look like, how exactly is she acting?", "YTA\n\nKids who are siblings of kids with cancer get forgotten a lot during their siblings treatment. Her attention seeking behavior is likely because if she didn\u2019t act that way then she will sit on the back-burner. For the last 1+ year(s) everyone has likely been catering to Ellie and been making Maya feel bad if she asks for or needs anything. \n\nMy cousin went through cancer.

No one wanted your opinion or input in that situation. Why do you think you are entitled to speaking like that to her?  And i feel so sorry for Maya. Believe me, if Maya could switch families to have a \"normal\" family, she would, anytime. She is an attention seeker because she never had attention on herself. She was always supposed to be the grown up, the responsible and less needy kid, because, well, she doesnt have cancer.

Assholes like you are why people go no contact with their \"families\".", "So the whole family ignored Ellie the whole time she had cancer?  No one gave her any attention?  From your comments you are a pretty shitty excuse for a human being.", "Info: how is she the center of attention all the time?", "The thing about sharing is that it's consensual, not the result of stealing. Maya had the spotlight taken away from her, and your response is telling her to let it be taken? I bet if someone took money out of your wallet and told you it wouldn't kill you to share, you'd be about as willing as Maya was.", "Or the cancer free announcement should have been its own thing, not tagged onto someone else's birthday party. YTA.", "This kind of announcement overshadows the person the party was for. Just like you don\u2019t propose at a wedding without the bride and groom\u2019s permission. That\u2019s their moment. This was Maya\u2019s moment. It should not at all have been about Ellie. Ellie could have her moment at the party they were planning to throw. Maya might be an attention seeker because in her daily life she is not the priority given her sister\u2019s health.", ">They were planning to announce it in a party they were planning to throw. Ellie was just too excited to keep it a secret\n\nInteresting that you interpret *Maya* as the \"attention seeker\" when Ellie couldn't bear to see her sister being the centre of attention at her own birthday party.  Ellie's just a kid and of course she's excited that she's cancer free. But it's telling that she knew just how to ensure she would still be the centre of attention and did not like to see her sister being made much of by her friends. I don't blame Ellie: she's a kid. I do blame you and your brother.", "Ellie would have survived another night without making her announcement during her sister's birthday. That almost seems malicious.", "They kept the news she was cancer-free from her father? Who does that? That's monstrous.  This seems so intentional to ruin Maya's party", "In my eyes ellie is the one attention seeking here. She has been getting everyone attention during her time sick. Now she wants to do it in someone\u2019s birthday. The one time that was about maya it turns about ellie. Yta 100%", "sorry, still not buying it. And I'm speaking as someone who's niece battled cancer --  that kind of news is not withheld from the family in order to wait and throw a party", "They\u2019re both children. This is literally the logic that will drive a wedge between them. They are not the adults here. You are though and you can\u2019t separate Maya\u2019s needs from her sister\u2019s.", "Ok, so what has the period between Ellie's diagnosis and Maya's recent birthday party been like (and would you even REALLY know as I assume you do not live in this household)? Has it been 80%+ of the parents/family's attention going to Ellie herself/catering to Ellie's need due to her illness? Ellie didn't choose to be sick but Maya also didn't choose to have to share attention with a sick sibling. As parents of a child with special needs (whether temporarily or longer term/indefinitely), you should never push aside the needs of the healthy child(ren). Extended family could help with care/making arrangements for the sick child and/or with spending time with the healthy child. Sure if a child is sick for one week, fair enough 90% of the parents' time goes to that child. But when we are talking months or years (cancer), this is neglectful to the healthy child.\n\nYou know that a 14 year old healthy girl also needs parents, right?", "This right here is why Maya has to advocate for her family to give her attention and why it may seem like she is an attention seeker. She isn't an attention seeker. She is a 14 year old girl who is neglected by her family. She can't drive yet, how often does she get to see her friends or are he parents too busy taking Ellie to doctors appointments and treatments? Do her parents have time to support her activities? Help her with homework? If not, she is neglected, and you just reinforced that her birthday isn't even important. This kind of behavior will make her resent her sister and family..", "I think you should be more understanding of what Maya has been going through too. Of course it was horrible for Ellie, but it was horrible for Maya too. The fear, the sorrow, the pain of her loved ones, the sacrifice, the lack of attention. That\u2019s a lot for a 14 year old. Have some compassion.", "And this is why Maya goes NC with her family as soon as she is able", "Maya spends every minute of every day being told she has to be understanding of her sister. Why do you think she is so desperate for attention? Yes, it is terrible that Ellie had cancer, and it is wonderful that she is cancer free. But there are two girls in that family and this was one single night that got to be about Maya. Then your  brother took that away from her and you had to be an AH to her.   \n\n\nYTA", "Yes. Your brother didn't need to grab attention from the birthday girl at her own party. He just did it because he thought his feelings matter much, much more than the glass child of your family, Maya.  \n\n\nBest birthday wishes to Maya, who I'm sure was also glad to hear Ellie was cancer-free, but it would have been nice if her family acted like she mattered *too,* even if only one day out of the year.  \n\n\nYTA, and your brother too.", "Yes, to quote yourself- Ellie would have and should have survived the night of her sister's party without making herself the centre of attention. You were a AH to the wrong neice.", " Yes I can totally blame him, and in fact I strongly do.", "Ya he\u2019s a shit father", "It's more that you tell Maya that she is self centered that we can blame you on.\nYATA.", "You can be happy for someone without announcing it to the rest of the party. You know how? You just say quietly to the other person \"That's fantastic news, let me take you out for ice cream next weekend?\" and then you go back to being part of the party.", "Yes, I think he was in the wrong. It was not for him to decide to make a big announcement, especially not at someone else\u2019s party.", "Yeah, yeah I can blame him. There are 365 days in a year and  minus a few hours, all of them arnt Maya's birthday party.", "right? like wtf OP?", "My brother is not their father it's their uncle", "I\u2019m with you\u2026 the only attention seeker in this scenario is OP \ud83d\ude06", "She didn't go through any of that. Judging by the things that we saw, she couldn't care less about Ellie. She only cares about herself", "You were still an AH. Poor Maya, the healthy child clearly  crying out for attention then birthday ruined.", "Well apparently the men in your family lack empathy, wisdom, and tact if you and your brother are any indication.  \n\n\nWhat a matched set of assholes, ruining a child's birthday and then attacking them for being upset over it.", "Oh fuck off, I find it hilarious that if this is real you as an adult as expecting a child to show more maturity and u derstanding than you are \ud83d\ude02. Like talk about being a hypocrite.\n\nWhy do you hate the child? And don't use \"they are attention seeker\" because you are literally on social media for validation right now, so why do you hate your neice?", "Of course she went through all of that and more. You just don\u2019t recognize it, because she doesn\u2019t express it in the way you want.", "Are you even around her that often like lmao", "Lmao as though you know what a 14 year old is feeling. Do you not remember being a teenager, or are you still a teenager? Because that's how you're behaving. Zero emotional intelligence from everyone in this story *but* Maya, really.", "Of course she would since there's no one else to care about her :/", "She could have handled it so much better by then saying her birthday was e even better now with this wonderful news", "most 14 year olds aren\u2019t as emotionally developed as adults are.", "She's a hurt child who was blindsided.  Few adults have that emotional maturity. Seems unfair to expect it of a 14 year old moments after having her birthday ruined."]}
