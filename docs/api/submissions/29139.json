I don't owe you even basic civility in my home, but you owe me your company, so do as I tell you!\" Not signs that Mom really wants to see her daughter enough to make an effort to make her welcome instead of stomping her feet and demanding like an entitled toddler.\n\nOP does not owe her mother any length of time being berated and insulted by Mom's girlfriend because Mom is not willing to put her daughter's comfort and well-being over her girlfriend's need to shoot her mouth off and make her daughter feel unwelcome and unloved. If Mom wants her to visit AT ALL, Mom needs to get her crap together, demand her girlfriend be at least civil to her daughter, and work on making her daughter's visits a pleasure rather than a painful ordeal."]}
