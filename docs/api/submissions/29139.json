It would probably be long-term better for your relationship if you went, but if you can't handle it, there's nothing wrong with choosing not to go.

Your mom's girlfriend blames you for another adult's behavior and choices. Your mom allows it. That's emotionally abusive in my opinion and I would not go either.
