It\u2019s the same with my mom. The summer before my first university year i\u2019ve babysat my nephew ALL SUMMER. And yeah i understood that i have to help out the family and i didn\u2019t mind it. I could never go out because of my nephew. And again i didn\u2019t mind it. \n\nBut lately it seems to be getting out of hand. The first semester of uni has been really stressful and whenever i tried to sit in the library to do some work mom and sister would both call and text me saying something along the lines of: \u201cwhere the fuck are you?\u201d, and \u201cYou never help out\u201d. \u201cI did so much to raise you and for what?\u201d If i go out with friends she\u2019d get mad as usual and say \u201ci was just waste of her time\u201d, \u201cjust stay home and watch your nephew, u got nothing better to do anyways\u201d\n\nBut the that made me most upset was- \nDuring finals week, i was swamped with work and had 1 exam every day from Monday to Friday. Everyday mom asked me if i had exam the next day and when i say i do she\u2019d get really mad and would say \u201cYou\u2019re so useless\u201d, and sis would add that \u201cI\u2019m being selfish\u201d. \nI really truly think that i am NOT responsible for my nephew. I just don\u2019t know at this point. I\u2019m really lost. Am i the asshole? And if i am, why? I genuinely don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1672144791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwer6n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_look_after_my_nephew/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You must keep those studies up and do well in college to ensure your future - your sister should appreciate that. As much as you can, continue to help out and be a team player, but it sounds like you need to install some boundaries that need to be respected.
