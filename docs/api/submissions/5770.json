It\u2019s the same with my mom. The summer before my first university year i\u2019ve babysat my nephew ALL SUMMER. And yeah i understood that i have to help out the family and i didn\u2019t mind it. I could never go out because of my nephew. And again i didn\u2019t mind it. \n\nBut lately it seems to be getting out of hand.

I even feel a little sorry for you and your nephew - both of you are in a toxic place", "NTA. I\u2019m about to be facing a similar situation myself. My family is very dependent on me and my sister recently got pregnant with her second child, with an abusive guy who\u2019s no longer in the picture. I\u2019m getting out of here ASAP, as should you. When someone decides to have a child, they have to accept the responsibility of being a parent and that nobody else has to be there to pick up the slack. I\u2019m 22, I\u2019ve worked very hard and been very careful to not have a child because I want to live my life and become financially and emotionally stable enough to have one. I\u2019m not going to set my life aside for someone else\u2019s child, I just won\u2019t, regardless of how my family will react to that (I have a million other reasons for cutting them off but this was a huge one). You should never have had to accept responsibility for something that was never yours to begin with. Prioritize yourself and your future, because it\u2019s clear that they aren\u2019t even grateful for how much you\u2019ve stepped up so far out of the kindness of your heart. Don\u2019t let them take advantage of you and ruin your opportunities and steal your youth because your sister wanted to have a child.\nEDIT- I also helped raise her first child because she was out and about \u201cliving her life\u201d, meeting new men, etc. I will not do it again, I realize I may have a harsh viewpoint on this but I don\u2019t think a parent is entitled to other people watching their kids for free when they chose to have them. As a parent, you have to step up and take responsibility.", "This. OP, what your family is doing is not okay. If you worked instead of watching your nephew you might be able to afford a room with other college students. I'd be looking at loans or grants that might help you afford to live on campus, or see if you have friends or family you can live with. Either way, I'd start limiting how often you're at home and I'd be responding back, \"I am not the mother of this child. When I babysit, I'm helping out. Stop acting like it's my job to raise this baby.\" I would copy and paste the same response EVERY time. And I would tell your sister, \"The next time you send me a text asking where I am when your child isn't my responsibility is the LAST time I help you with your kid. PAY for daycare or a babysitter, don't guilt your siblings into doing your job.\" And I would stick to it. \n\nIf you think your mom will throw you out though, and you have nowhere else to go, I would just ALWAYS be gone and not bother doing more than scanning their messages because you know it'll be toxic, manipulative stuff.", "OP clarified she can but doesn\u2019t see the use of hiring one when OP is there.", "I\u2019m guessing that the idea of paying you to babysit never crossed either of their minds. Is your mom doing this so you have no social life and will not be able to date and get someone pregnant or has your sister always been the golden child? And where is the baby daddy in all this? \nNTA and you need to set some boundaries and look into living elsewhere.", "Tell her to hire a sitter because you're done helping her.", "Tell her you are NOT THE FATHER therefore NOT responsible. She went to uni and now it's your turn so YOU can have a career. Is it possible for you to move to uni campus? Or have a friend you can crash with until you get a part time job to help with expenses with a roommate?", "She doesn't need a sitter. She needs a nanny if she is going to work those hours. That kid is not your responsibility. Your responsibility is school and work. If she didn't want to raise a kid, she should have adopted him out. NTA and stand your ground.", "If she is 26, she is at best an intern or resident and definitely not making the large salary you think she is. She is probably making a good but not great salary and working long hours. BTW, I did my training 30 years ago. Being a single mom would make it really tough without help.\n\nRegardless, the OP is NTA. If the sister is living at home, she can afford child care", "I\u2019ve met a whole bunch of techs who misidentify themselves.  Plus, the sister sounds dumb and seems like one of the techs who would do this.  Lol.", "Yes, so did I. But I am from Germany and didn't go to college during a cost of living crisis. Especially here in the US, it is not feasible for every 18 year old college student to leave home from one day to the other.", "Not in this economy."]}
