She got upset and made the case that, because it's summer, staying out super late should be allowed & the case that the drinking is not \" super bad\". She followed that up with, \" You're acting like I went and became a teenage parent. Oh, wait, that wasn't me...who was that?\", which was clearly directed at me.

Right as she came home?\n\nEDIT: NTA. \n\nShe did it once and was spared any consequences with a discussion instead. She immediately exploited it and when questioned the second time, she made personal insults at you.  While I\u2019m not sure you handled it perfectly, I do think the punishment fits, but you are going to have to work on keeping better tabs on her. Maybe set a curfew, make sure you know where she is and possibly consider if alcohol should even be allowed PERIOD.", "NTA\n\nYou have your daughter some latitude and she took advantage of it.  She needs to understand there are consequences for her behavior.", "As somebody who started drinking at 15, I got caught the first time because I left the liquor cabinet open, I feel like she\u2019s just being a kid. And lotta kids drink around this age for the first time, and I think you\u2019re doing the right thing where you gave her leniency one time, but then put the hammer down hard this time if I were you, I\u2019d also show her the drunk, driving accident videos that cops out on their body can, that was something that really got to me and I never had one sip of alc and drank and drive after that when I got my license, even at 22, I get an Uber. My parents install the fear of God me about drinking and driving or can you do situation and drinking, but they also understood how they were as kids, and how I was. I think ur NTA, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s hanging out with the wrong crowd, I think she\u2019s just a normal highschooler, just make sure your educating her on the dangers of drinking, driving while under any influence, and how you always be available, she ever needs a ride. Those are the things that made me drink safe even to this day.", "NTA. You got a kid breaking the rules.  You gave her a pass with just a talk the first time, and she (as teenagers do) pressed her luck to see how serious you were.", "It sounds like your child doesn't have a curfew, or a lot of limits on her behavior.  It also sounds like you treat her as an adult, and in a sense like an equal, so her mouthing off to you about the teenaged parent thing might have felt more normal to her than to a kid with a parent who makes them salute.\n\nGiven that Haley is going out late drinking at parties, I think you need some clear rules or guildlines -- not the \"long leash\" mentioned here.  Clearly, like most kids her age, she lacks the judgment to make her own rules.\n\nYou need to figure out what is and isn't OK with you, and then you need to convey that to Haley in a clear, direct, parental way.  She's not an adult.  She's not your equal in experience or judgment and she's making some really bad choices.\n\nSo here goes:\n\nStep one:  A curfew.  You need to establish a curfew.  You need to lay out what the consequences will be for violating the curfew.  (A month of being grounded seems excessive, although 2:30 in the morning dead drunk for a 16 y.o. is so dangerous and problematic...)\n\nStep two:  Drinking and drugs.  Is it OK with you if she drinks or smokes pot?  If this is not OK with you, you need a rule.  If she stumbles home drunk, one consequence.  If she calls you from a party where there's drinking to come get her, you will always come get her.  Zero consequence if she isn't drinking.  Lesser consequence that won't deter her from calling you if she is drinking.\n\nStep three:  You always need to know where she is at night.  Period.  Finished.  Decide if it's OK with you if she's at a house with no parents present.  Set the rule.  The phone has to be turned on.  There's a tracker on the phone.  What's the consequence if she turns off the phone?\n\nI think you've assumed that your child had the judgment and the impulse control of an adult.  She doesn't.  You're the adult.  A one-time, month-long grounding that sounds like it's a reaction to disrespectful mouthing off more than this other stuff doesn't suffice.  You need to lay out the groundwork for Haley to have a safe life.  She's going to be extremely pissed off.  Live with it.\n\nYTA but not for the thing you posted about", "NTA\n\nYou treated her like an adult and sat her down the first time and explained why her behavior was out of line, and what your expectations were going forward.  She said it wouldn't happen again, indicating she understood.  Then she went back on her words and repeated the behavior.  She needs to learn now, before she's an adult in the real world, that actions have consequences.  \n\nThe way she blew up at you might indicate something else going on that you are unaware of.  Then again, it may just be teenage rebellion.  That's for you to figure out.  \n\nIf you raised your voice and yelled at her, that *is* asshole behavior, and I recommend you apologize for that once you both cool off.  You are the adult, she is the child, and yelling is not how adults should handle things.  That doesn't mean adults don't mess up.  You're only human.  Just like she is.  Talk about it.", "My dude, I gotta say YTA. It's loooong past time that you should have snugged that leash. 30 days of being grounded is never going to even out 16 years of minimal discipline. Better late than never, but expect MAJOR pushback from here on out. Set firm rules, establish (and hold!) consequences for breaking those rules and hope like hell that the next 2 years+ don't end up being a crapshoot of \"will I see my daughter after she turns 18 if I don't allow X thing?\"", "NTA. I was raised in a similar manner to how you are raising your daughter, but if I took advantage of that leniency I faced consequences for it. I had to earn that level of trust and if I did something to break it, I\u2019d lose it. And that sounds like the situation you\u2019re facing now - she\u2019s abusing the level of freedom you gave her and is now refusing to listen to you, and there are consequences for that.\n\nEspecially if I mouthed off to my parents the way your daughter did to you.\n\nEDIT: I do recommend talking to her about everything again in a couple of days, when tempers have cooled - explain again why you grounded her and what your concerns are, and that her cheap shot at you hurt, and then hear HER side of the story. And go from there.", "NTA\n\nA drunk 16 year old out at night is a vulnerable 16 year old who no longer has good decision-making skills. She's also breaking the law, depending on where you live. So serious stuff.\n\nAnd she needs to learn that it's not ok to be snarky. Snarky has consequences.\n\nThe you're horrible, mean, etc. stuff has been screamed at parents by teens through many years. It's almost a rite of passage. \n\nHold your ground. There's a light at the end of the tunnel but it will take awhile.\n\nedit: one caveat: Tell her never to get in a car with a driver who's been drinking and to call you instead to come get her, and make sure she knows she won't be punished under those conditions no matter what led up to it. You want her safe and alive and not afraid to contact you for help if she messed up.", "NTA\n\nYou should have grounded her a lot sooner.", "Kinda YTA.\nSeems you had a discussion with her about it in the middle of the night when she's a bit drunk? Of course she won't listen to you and give attitude.\nHere in Qu\u00e9bec vast majority of teens do drink at 16 during parties, so she's kinda right it's not a big deal drinking.\nInstead of scolding her, I'd instead try to find solutions to keep her safe. How is she going and coming back from the party, making sure she doesn't drive after drinking or catch a ride from someone who drank. Knowing that she can call you if things get dangerous at the party or something already happened. Or depending on the laws and how strict, that she has the parties in your basement/backyard.\n\nGrounding her or preventing her from going to parties is just a good way to insure she sneaks away and doesn't tell if something happen.", "YTA \n\nI feel like you just ensured your kid turns into a sneak and liar and tells you nothing therefore putting herself in danger\n\nShe will now lie and say she sleeping at Trudies house but be laying drunk in a paddock. \n\nDude, she\u2019s 16! Your only weapon is good communication and mutual respect and trust.", "YTA - a month is a long time and doesn't get to the root of the issue. I'd have opted for a required month of therapy or something that would help her in the long run.", "NTA in any way.", "NTA.\n\nHeavy alcohol use as a teen causes permanent changes to the addiction centers of the brain.\n\nIf she can\u2019t be respectful, then she can\u2019t go out.\n\nIn our house, you get one freebie. After that, all bets are off.", "NTA, and why are teenagers so MEAN??! Going thru a similar situation with our 16yo son; who up until this year has been pretty respectful and close with us, but now we\u2019re in daily arguments pushing back on our rules (he\u2019s no longer allowed at his gf\u2019s house since her mom gave them alcohol and then left to go on a date; a direct disregard of my request that when he\u2019s over there they are not left alone which she agreed to) and omg he\u2019s so disrespectful and arrogant and rude and mean. \ud83d\ude2d I finally had to come to terms with being ok with him hating me for a couple of years. And it sucks, but all my friends are telling us we\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nSince your daughter broke the rules twice now I think the grounding is appropriate. Since she was on a long leash before, I would also recommend laying out your exact expectations and boundaries. Stay strong!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is definitely taking advantage of your leinancy, most parents would have blown a gasket the first time. You two should go to family counseling though, her comment seemed pretty directed and someone may be talking crap about you to her.", "NTA in general, but a month is pretty long all things considered.\n\nIf you treat her like an adult, she will treat you like an equal. Isnt that what \"treating like an adult\" essentially means? You should remove a bit of the blame you put on her for that.\n\nShe IS NOT an adult yet, and she IS overstepping, but you have been acting differently until now, and the first time she tried to test how true you were to your word, she managed to get away without really getting punished. Thats what teens do, they test the limits.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is flip from \"you can do everything\" to \"you arent allowed to do anything\", because to a teen 16 isnt so far off to 18, if you get what i mean. They FEEL like adults already.", "Hmm I'll go with NTA but I don't think you handled it well. Your initial reaction was better. I personally already have a whole ass plan for when my daughters are this age.. I was only a few years older when I had my kids so I can understand that 'you're young enough to remember that age' bit and totally understand why you're freaked out.\n\nI plan to find some good documentaries and interviews etc about the dangers of drinking, specifically for young women. For myself I will be detailing my experience with being r*ped after having my drink roofied and being hospitalized with alcohol poisoning. I'll also be detailing the amount of people I saw taken away by ambulance when I was bartending at a nightclub. \n\nNot all at once but these are things I want to raise my kids with a general awareness of. Because they're very real and happen very very frequently.\n\nI would be having a lot of conversations about how to stay safe if you are drinking and I will be saying to my kids that I would prefer to know before they go out drinking that they're planning to drink and asking them to check in with my now and then whilst out and to message me when they're ready to be picked up or if they feel they've had too much...\n\nYou really can't punish this behaviour because it's likely to just exacerbate it. I still think NTA because I get it. I'm a parent too and it is really scary.\n\nGood luck. I hope she keeps herself safe.", "NTA\n\nLetting your minor drink at all is your business. Letting your minor insult you, get drunk, stay out late, and not receiving corrective action would make you an uninvolved parent. I think you did the right thing.\n\nYou treated her like an adult and she proved she was unable to behave like one.", "OP you are her parent, not her friend.  You are legally responsible for her and if she does something illegal you are responsible for her actions.  I'm sure that's the way you were raised, just like I was and the rest of the commenters here were too.  It's your job to prepare her for what the world is expecting from her, and it's important that she has rules to follow, which doesn't include underage drinking.  She may not like you now, but at least you care enough about her to discipline her.", "NTA but I think a month is too long. Cut it in half.", "NTA but a month is harsh. I would discuss some options for her but the partying has to go. If only I had some brain scans for you...alcohol and drugs can have up to twice as much damage on the brain until the age of 25.", "This. Is she hanging with a new crowd? Has something happened at school you don\u2019t know about? Either way NTA. Explain to her that you want to continue to trust and give her leeway, but if she\u2019s behaving like this and putting herself in danger (and others if she is driving) you have no choice but to set tough boundaries. If something is going on, consider therapy. Good luck.", "Prior to this, the stuff she was doing was like little white lies or talking back to a teacher, but, this is obviously a new level", "I should've clarified in OP, and I'll edit in a second, but, no, it was the next morning.", "I\u2019m so impressed with this advice. Very well thought out. I love it.", "I didn't giver a curfew, but, I told her when she started going out to use her best judgement and be reasonable. Usually she's home by 10:45-11:15. No pot, mainly because I can't stand the smell. Drinking is something that, on special days, like christmas, thanksgiving, I've been fine with, she'll have a single glass of wine and that's it.", ">She's not an adult. She's not your equal in experience or judgment and she's making some really bad choices.\n\nOooooh, I like that. I'm gonna tuck that away for hopefully never (but realistically, let's hope i remember it in 10 years)", "I'm sure op would love to have mutual respect and trust but his daughter is taking advantage of his leniency and being super disrespectful. She needs to come to the table for it to work, she seems unwilling.", "I think OP\u2019s daughter found his throwaway account. (NTA)", "Could be teenage angst, could be something deeper.", "Clarify this also: What country do you live in OP, bc in the US the legal drinking age is 21 and even in Europe its 18. \n\nI know you want her to be independent and have been \"treating her like an adult\" but this isnt a Disney movie. This is the real world and she is a child. You seem very ok with her beaking the law and endangering herself and everyone around her. You need to let her know of the very real consequences of this kind of behavior. The best case worst scenario is she ends up pregnant. The absolute worst is she ends up cut into pieces and left in a ditch. \n\nYou gotta stop being her friend and start being a parent.", "Thank you.", "OK, it sounds like you tried to allow her to develop her own good judgment, but that has stopped working this summer.  So now you need to really sit down and think about what the limits are.  \n\nFirst, what is the latest it's OK with you that she comes home on weekends this summer?\n\nWhat will the consequence be if your limit is midnight and she comes in at 1:30?\n\nSecond, what are you going to tell her about drinking or smoking pot at parties or when just hanging out with friends?\n\nWhat will the consequence be if she comes home drunk or stoned?\n\nHonestly, OP, you have two incidents that could have turned out very, very badly for Haley.  Were there older kids at the party?  How old?  Was a 20 year old guy doing shots with her?  Who was she hanging out with?  Do you know?  Were there drugs beyond pot?  Where was she and who was she with?\n\n(You really need to know this.  Even if she were showing up at 11:15, you would still need to know this.  But especially with these two drunken party nights, you need to think this stuff through and decide what's OK with you.  Not what's OK with Haley as coming come drunk at 2:30 is OK with Haley.)", "Sure she is. She\u2019s a 16 year old teenager. \n\nI mean in Australia kids have a Medicare card at 14 and can go to a doctors appointment without a parent. \n\n16 year olds are usually starting the last year of high school. \n\nMost parents are aware their kids drink and are trying things but want to set guidelines that keep them safe. \n\nGrounding a 16 year old for a month for being drunk a second time will just teach her to sleep at someone else\u2019s house and not come home. \n\nShe is likely having s\u00e9x and making all sorts of adult choices. \n\nCommunication, communication, communication! That\u2019s it. That\u2019s your weapon.", "Yep, and it\u2019s kind of hard to tell until shit hits the fan. My sister started drinking around the same as OP\u2019s daughter and her temperament and attitude took a real spiral, which we all assumed at the time was teenage angst.", "Legal drinking age (for beer) is 16 here in Germany, so you are not entirely correct.\n\nAt least in my friend circle it was not unusual to come home drunk (more like tipsy) after midnight, though we informed our parents beforehand.\n\nNot that I condone the behaviour, I just wanted to chime in with my experience. \n\nIf you are worried about her walking home alone, offer to get her, no matter what. Safety should be paramount, and she should know that she can count on you to get her. Sure, it is annoying to get up at 1am, but what is the alternative? Let her get into a car of a drunk friend?", "11:45 would be my absolute latest. I guess the consequences need to be groundings. From what I gathered it was just her usual group of friends, they've just now decided that it's time to start getting fake IDs and buying alcohol", "This is good.  If 11:45 is your latest, you need to tell Hayley very clearly, not angrily.  You know, not in a new sheriff in town kind of way, but very matter of factly.  And then tell her exactly what happens if she violates this curfew.  I do think that a month is excessive for just violating (as opposed to violating drunk, which is a whole different thing), but it's completely up to you.  You're the dad.\n\nAlso, clarify what you mean by grounding for her.  Does it mean she only goes to school and comes straight home?  Are there outside activities she can still participate in?  Is she allowed to have friends over at your house?  If so, only when you're there, or whenever?  Does she have complete access to her phone and and of her electronics?\n\nIt's different in different households, and as you haven't done this before, you need to figure out and then clearly communicate what it means to be grounded at your house.\n\nAlso, if you're friends -- or at least cordial acquaintances -- with Hayley's friends' parents, and if they seem like reasonable people, you might want to talk with them.  If your kid came home drunk that late, it's likely that their kids did too.  You might want to feel them out to get their take on the situation and to  find out how they're handling the change.", "Your advice is fantastic. I'd just like to say, if OP insists on keeping the grounding a month, which imo I feel is a bit long for a first ever grounding attempt, then I'd relax it a bit each week.\n\n E.g week one- full grounding, straight home from school\n\nWeek 2- if not broken rules in week one, allow friends at the house\n\nWeek 3- same but with full explanation of new rules as laid out by yourself in your parent comment to OP. And if not kicking up a fuss:\n\nWeek 4- ungrounded."]}
