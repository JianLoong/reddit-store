I'll go ahead and say it: street food is not equal, especially when it comes to sanitary practices. Wearing gloves like many others suggested is like the tip of the iceberg when it comes to food preparation, others including where the food is sourced,  how long the food is cooked, how clean are the cooking and prepping surfaces, is there disinfectant in sight,  etc. You DO have to listen to your gut when you're travelling as everyone's immune systems is different too, especially if you grow up in one country and climate, you are more susceptible to a different country's climate and bacteria and viruses. One thing you CAN do is search up reviews of what seem like the most safe for foreigners food stalls online, like ones with recommendations.

The fact that he\u2019s okay with his wife eating it actually speaks to the conclusion that he\u2019s probably *not* racist: he just doesn\u2019t feel comfortable eating it himself.", "You sound like something who has never traveled to a third world country.  I have eaten \\*some\\* street food, but it's pretty intimidating how unhygienic it is - right in front of you.  They aren't trying to hide it.  My friend had the sharts for the trip home after he bravely ate something the rest of us couldn't stomach.", "I agree. I'm European but live in SEA with my spouse who's from here. Street food is not some \"curiosity\" over here, it's a way of life and a lot of people eat what's considered street food in the West multiple times a day. Unless you were at the end of some shady alley, I'm willing to bet that there were other street vendors and stalls near the area you were going to eat at, and likely plenty of customers. Similarly, this is the vendors livelihood - if people regularly get sick from their food, or even if it's not very tasty, they will soon be out of business because their money comes mostly from locals, not from tourists. If OPs wife has been going there for so long that it's one of her long standing favourites, it's not gonna be dangerous. Sounds like OP needs to address his internalised racism, especially if he's married to a POC.", "Now that is dumb.  He\u2019s racist because he doesn\u2019t want to eat street food in a possibly less developed nation?  We don\u2019t even know where this was.  His logic makes sense.  I wouldn\u2019t want to get food poisoning in a foreign country and shit my brains out.", "One of the dumbest comments I've read in some time. Culturally racist because he doesn't want to catch a norovirus? Lol", "Not wanting to die on the toilet is not racist.", "Your weird, guy didn\u2019t use gloves, in OP\u2019s opinion it grossed them out. They have every right to determine what food they eat, y\u2019all are crazy. HUGE NTA", "I agree with you.", "I don't even want street food in the US... I've traveled a bit, and yea, some street food can be super dodgy. Not everyone is practicing hygienic, safe, clean spaces when preparing meals. Pending on parts of the world, it's advised to travel with tums and things to help with dehydration in the event you get food poisoning.", "Man I agree, if any of these yt people are saying it\u2019s not racist, well they probably give off a lot of microaggressions as well and deny it. Imo it\u2019s worse to deny it and hurt poc than it is to accept it and do better but people don\u2019t often learn", "Oh no, don\u2019t get me wrong! If OP admits that he never eats out, he always cooks at home, and he never touches what his dad has barbecued because the old man\u2019s got a weak bladder, and after a few beers, the seal breaks and he\u2019s off to the toilet every ten minutes in between throwing food in the barbecue\u2026\n\n\u2026if he answers like that, I would obviously make my judgement in his favour.\n\nStreet stalls can vary in quality, true, and I have a sneaking suspicion that his partner, actually being *from* that country and city, probably knows the best (kinds of) places to go and eat. He thinks he knows better than she does about her homeland, which is a whole other issue.\n\nI agree with you though. I am an unabashed A H, but that\u2019s not important right now.\n\nEdited: typo", "rejecting cultural practices because they don't meet your \"standard\" doesn't make you bougie it makes you racist", "I've travelled all around SE Asia and I've gotten way sicker eating at Chipotle than I have eating from street vendors.

Sure as others have said he has veto over what he eats, but in terms of respect and trust for a spouse it's not good.", "Not like that \ud83d\ude02 I was being sarcastic, indicating that he won't die from eating street food unless otherwise stated. If it's popular enough, it's edible.", "I can appreciate that but also...\n\nHave you ever seen reports from food inspections and the restaurants they closed up? Because if you think these street food stalls or restaurants in south east Asia are that much worse than what you can find in the \"developed\" world, you are truly mistaken.", "He says specifically South-East Asia though, not South Asia", "It\u2019s not, the OP said Southeast Asia.", "This is why you get a short course of antibiotics just in case before you leave to a foreign country - just in case! I\u2019ve not had issues, and that includes some reeeeeeally sketch street food in west Africa (iron stomach is the trade off I get for other health issues I guess), but knowing I have both broad antibiotics to deal with food poisoning and anti-diarrheals in case there\u2019s a long travel day ahead and I need to stick a cork in it, I feel ok with street food unless it is like\u2026a stall surrounded in trash, or there\u2019s obvious cross contamination with raw/cooked meat or something.

In my family of 5 we can all eat the same thing and I will be the only one with food poisoning.i was told I have an over sensitivity to certain bacteria.

Yeah, I am NEVER eating at one. None of them look like they are the remotest bit clean, they are literally squatting in dirt or in a dirty street and nothing they are cooking with looks clean. I have seen them do a ton of unsanitary stuff. And then they are posting videos about it! So these are probably the \"good\" ones. No thanks. And if I know you don't wash your hands in the bathroom or you just nasty, then no, I am not touching your pot luck. But I pray restaurants are semi clean. It is not racist to not want to eat stuff that is being prepared in a dirty environment, aka a freaking street. Just the name makes me nope right out of that. I am sure he is fine eating all the Asian food prepared by Asian people in nice clean restaurants", "You mean the same restaurants that will have employees handle money in the very same gloves that they will then prep your food with? Gloves are only good if you replace them every fuckin' time you switch up tasks. It'd be like a dr not changing gloves between patients.", "Just no, clutching at straws. There was nothing in the post which stated that the conditions were unhygienic because they were in Asia. Any person could make that claim about any street vendor, anywhere in the world if the conditions don\u2019t look hygienic enough. Your looking for racism where there is none. There is an Indian take away 5 mins down the street from me which I will never order from because it looks dirty inside, does that make me a racist? No. I\u2019d prefer to not get unwell if I can help it. Plenty of other places to eat so why risk it if your unsure?", "is a restaurant not a stranger?", "Haha I know, I just couldn\u2019t resist!

But yes, I also firmly believe that food safety in general is going to be far worse in a developing country than in the US, with exceptions for sure.

I also look up restaurants to see if they\u2019ve recently been inspected and what grade they got by the health inspector lol. \n\nA local restaurant got shut down for 6 weeks with egregious health violations.
