I'll go ahead and say it: street food is not equal, especially when it comes to sanitary practices. Wearing gloves like many others suggested is like the tip of the iceberg when it comes to food preparation, others including where the food is sourced,  how long the food is cooked, how clean are the cooking and prepping surfaces, is there disinfectant in sight,  etc. You DO have to listen to your gut when you're travelling as everyone's immune systems is different too, especially if you grow up in one country and climate, you are more susceptible to a different country's climate and bacteria and viruses. One thing you CAN do is search up reviews of what seem like the most safe for foreigners food stalls online, like ones with recommendations.

The great thing about street food is that you can actually tell if something looks genuinely unhygienic (like food is being cooked but then left in unheated containers before serving, or raw and cooked foods are being kept together, or food isn't being cooked for long enough to kill bacteria).
