My parents have had their dog, call him Mickey, for over 5 years.  Mickey has never been comfortable with me.  He actually seems to have an aversion to all larger women, which I am.  My parents were convinced if I just gave it time, he'd get over it.\n\nMickey's fight or flight reaction when startled is to lunge teeth first.  He is hyper protective of my parents, and they adore him.  Outside of their house, he's better, but I almost only see him at their house. \n\nDuring the time they have had him he has lunged at, or actually bitten, several female guests.  Only 1 solid bite I know of, and that seemed to be shrugged off.  That was a family member, and the bite was never reported.\n\nAll family gatherings happen at my parents' house, as they are the only ones with enough space.  Normally Mickey is tethered on one side of the living room near where my parents usually sit.  Last year at one gathering Mickey was being good, so they untethered him, and all was okayish.  Then they encouraged me to give Mickey a treat.  I really did want to get along with the dog.  I love animals, and miss dogs they had in the past.  So, sitting on the couch, I gave Mickey a treat.  He took it, that was fine.  Then I made a mistake.  I leaned a little forward to pet him.  He looked up, saw me looming over him, and lunged.  He tore the top I was wearing.\n\nFor Christmas last year, we were told that Mickey would be closed in their bedroom for the day.  That lasted all of maybe an hour, because Mickey can't be separated from Mom and Dad and started barking at whining.  They brought him out and tethered him, so I spent the rest of the day nervous.\n\nI talked with my husband (49M) and he agreed that we should let my parents know that we will no longer be coming to them if Mickey is present.  I have asked them to please look into having a canine behaviorist come to their house to work with them.  But their groomer said it probably wouldn't help, so they never looked into it.\n\nThey boarded Mickey for the day once so I could see a family member who was visiting from out of state at their house.  They also boarded him for Thanksgiving for us this year.  However, they were not able to get a reservation for this Christmas.  My mother started talking about how he'd be tethered, and it would be fine.  I stopped that by stating that if Mickey was there, we wouldn't be.\n\nHusband is fully on board, confirming his willingness to walk out and drive more than an hour home if they ever tell us Mickey's boarded but then don't board him.\n\nI have always had a close, loving relationship with my parents.  They love to see us, and they tell us we are always welcome.  This is the first time in my adult life that I am at a loss for how to reconcile their disregard for my safety.  Their house is not safe for me when Mickey is there.\n\nAm I the Asshole for telling my parents that I will no longer come to their house when Mickey is there, even if it costs us time and even holidays together?", "created_utc": 1701542213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189a0eo/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_christmas_if_my/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents cannot control the dog and for whatever reason, won't accept that Mickey is scary and dangerous.\n\nEither they board the dog or you stay home. It's your face, your skin and your enjoyment of the holiday. No one wants to spend time in the emergency room getting stitches on Christmas.", "NTA. They have options, including crating and muzzling him when there are visitors. They are making a choice about their priorities and you should too. If you don\u2019t stand your ground, they will not change anything.", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was a child my relatives had a (small) dog that HATED children. I was afraid of the dog and my parents told me he even tried to attack us children. One day my father had enough and screamed at them to take the dog away when children are present. They brought the dog to another room when we were over and that was it. \n\nOne of my pet rats years ago hated men. I dont know why, but the moment someone male touched him, he would instantly bite that person and wont let go. Solution: no male could touch him and he wasnt out when someone was over. Why would I risk the health of others?", "NTA I've got an Xmas gift suggestion for your parents - a large dog crate. The dog could be in the same room, but unable to bite people. \n\nPeople with untrained dogs that they won't take steps to protect their visitors? Those are who should be in a cage, IMHO.", "NTA\n\nI know it\u2019s hard with family but do what you must to stay safe. *If* it would put you at ease (no shame if you don\u2019t trust the idea), would your parents be open to Mickey wearing a muzzle? Normally not something I like to see on animals, but it maybe an acceptable compromise.", "NTA.\n\nMickey has a history of biting and your parents have a history of lying. It is perfectly reasonable for you to refuse to put up with that. \n\nOne solution would be to not go at all. You wouldn't be an asshole for doing that, but it seems sad. It sounds like you would like to see your parents if possible.\n\nI think your husband's support is wonderful. He's willing to walk out and drive home if necessary.\n\nHere's what I suggest. Set a boundary like this: \"Mom and Dad, I just can't handle being at your place if Mickey is off the leash. If he is off the leash, then I will leave the house and drive home.\" Here's the thing about effective boundaries: You need to communicate them ahead! Be absolutely clear with your parents about what you need and what you will do if your needs aren't met. And then you must follow through! **The first time you see Mickey off the leash, get up, walk out, and drive home.** \n\nYou can talk with them when you are setting the boundary. You can tell them you are scared to come because of what's happened in the past. You can tell them that you are **proposing** this boundary. They don't have to accept it, but if they won't, then you won't come. So it shouldn't be like you are just springing this on them. Have a conversation about it so that by the time you visit, they are absolutely clear about the rules.\n\nEven so, I suspect you will need to be strong. Your parents might be outraged. Your parents might say you are causing drama if you walk out. Hopefully they will apologize and never do it again. I mean, hopefully they will respect your boundary and not do it in the first place! But for a boundary to work, you must be willing to actually carry it out.", "NTA - In addition to him lunging and tearing your clothes, he has is a history of biting with no consistent training. \n\nGiven this, I am sorry.  It must be very hurtful for them to brush aside your sound request. They did not prioritize boarding him and I suspect they did not call boarders within a 60 or 90 miles radius. This conveys, \"You are not worth it....you'll adjust....you're exaggerating, etc. So, 100% leave if the dog is there; no compromises. If there are folks you want to convey hugs to ask them to step outside. Tell them you are leaving due to the dog; transparency is golden.\n\nAlso, the past 'solid bite' could have been a home insurance claim. Their insurer can chose to not renew their policy or will not cover future dog related incidents. If they bounce to another company they can reserve the right to not cover them if they still have the dog (repeat, repeat). They don't know how serious insurance companies respond to a 'bite'. However, loving and protecting you should be their critical focus, always. Best to you!", "NTA - The dog has a history of aggression and isn't safe to bring guests around. You shouldn't have to put yourself in danger to spend the holidays together. There are options, and if they choose not to take them, then you aren't being unreasonable by not going to their home. Your parents are making a choice, too.", "NTA.  You are NOT safe at their house and they are not willing to take the necessary actions to keep the dangerous  animal contained or trained. Enjoy your time at your home with your husband.  Tell your parents they are invited to your house, sans Dog, so you can have a late Christmas together", "NTA. Your parents are being huge AHs", "NTA If they are hosting or inviting guests, it is their responsibility to ensure the dog is secure and everyone is safe.\nWhat kind of dog is it?", "NTA. I have dogs, and love my dogs like family. With that said, I would never allow anyone to feel unsafe in my home. It is the host's responsibility to ensure no guests or family members are at risk from aggressive pets.\n\nYour parents' behavior is irresponsible, at best. You can't make them take corrective action, but you can certainly show them there will be consequences by refusing to come to their home.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to risk your safety because your parents refuse to acknowledge the reality of the situation. Mickey is reactive to you, and apparently to people who fit your description. They have taken no measures to try to understand why or to fix this (if it even can be fixed at this point. I have my doubts that the dog will ever get over this fear). It is all but guaranteed that, if given the chance, Mickey will bite you again. He can't help his fear reaction.\n\nAnd why would they want to put Mickey in that situation? Why would they want him to be uncomfortable or even afraid? And why would they put Mickey's future at risk? If he bites the wrong person, or the bite is serious enough, it will get reported. (If you go to the ER with a dog bite, the doctor is obligated to report it and Mickey will be investigated as a potentially vicious dog.) Why risk that Mickey will be taken away and/or euthanized? It's irresponsible on all levels.\n\nPerhaps, if you explain the latter to your parents, they will finally get the seriousness of this situation.", "A muzzle would be a wonderful compromise if your parents are willing to spend every day of the next three weeks acclimating him to the muzzle and training him to wear it, and even then that\u2019s very soon to expect him to wear it for an extended amount of time. If it\u2019s just slapped on him, it\u2019s cruel, and he will probably bark and whine - I know this from experience.\n\nA properly fitting muzzle needs to be big enough for the dog to eat, drink, and have a full pant, usually big enough to accommodate the dog\u2019s mouth if it were holding a tennis ball. Close-fitting muzzles worn for more than a very short amount of time like a vet visit are genuinely dangerous to the animal. And none of this is Mickey\u2019s fault.\n\nI suspect that if your parents are unwilling to engage with a behaviourist and unwilling to accept that their dog is dangerous and that he will - not might - cause further harm is allowed, then they\u2019re not the type of people to train the dog to accept the muzzle to a point it won\u2019t be at least a very uncomfortable and aversive experience. This means they won\u2019t be able to get it on him the next time they try - the dog has already learned to bite and snap as an effective tool to communicate his discomfort.\n\nYour parents suggestion that you feed an uncomfortable dog is also very unwise. That can create conflict in a food-driven dog, as you learned when he took the treat and you were then too close. The only way you won\u2019t have a hugely stressful holiday is if the dog is boarded or kept in another room as per your request.", "NTA. I have a fear aggressive/resource guarding (me being the resource) albeit tiny chihuahua and not only would it be irresponsible to put my guests at risk of being bitten by his tiny teeth it\u2019s doing a huge disservice to my dog to put him in stressful/fearful situations.  \n\nHe and the two other chihuahuas go in a crate with kongs to play with when guests who this dog doesn\u2019t know/isn\u2019t comfortable with come over.\n\nYour parents ATH not only for putting your safety at risk but stressing out their dog.", "NTA Even if the dog wasn't aggressive, I'm with you on this one. I'm terrified of dogs in general. It doesn't matter if a dog is apparently \"nice,\" and I get really tired of people trying to pull that excuse. I'm not going to automatically become comfortable around a dog solely based on that.", "NTA, you tried, they didn't bother. Set this boundary, don't come over. I get that boarding a dog during hollidays may be a challenge, but the should've known better and did that in advance.", "NTA", "It sounds like doggy anxiety--the over protectiveness, the biting, etc. Your parents are bad dog parents because they continually reward this behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Usually I say it\u2019s not fair to ask others to do things with their pets in their own home.  \n\nHowever, this is valid.  The dog is violent and sounds like a major accident waiting to happen.

I know they are too lenient with him, he has learned exactly how to get his way and they think it's funny/cute. \n\nAnd yeah, I do understand that being in the same room with Mickey means he is getting fear signals, which doesn't help either of us.", "That's not control, that's restraining him. A controlled dog doesn't need to be restrained.", "But they untie him because he\u2019s behaving so well.", "Tethering is not being able to control a dog. They are restraining the dog from being able to attack. Controlling the dog would be getting it behaviorally assessed and then training him to not be so reactive, defensive and anxious. \n\nThere's so many things that can go wrong with just tying up a dog, point and case in this story. The dog looks like it's behaving \"well\", gets let off then defensively attacks. If the dog gets too wound up it will make its way out of the restraint and bite someone. \n\nHowever I don't agree with OP, the dog shouldn't be boarded, that's just risking the dog biting other people who will report the bite (which may mean one dead dog. The parents need to wise up, grow up and find a behavorist and trainer to work through the dogs issues. But for some reason they're intent on listening to a groomer and risking their dogs (and other people's) safety. OP should just stay home.", "Sounds like you need to teach the kids dog safety an not let them overwhelm your dog to the point of unsafeness", "NTA.  Parents are.  My dog gets fear aggressive.  She's great with me and my kids.  Whenever company comes over, she gets locked in the bedroom.  Doesn't matter if she whines.  Safety of guests is more important then her being in the same room as the food.", "My big old great Pyrenees was a rescue who adored me and husband, we adored him, and he HATED everyone else (which I totally vibed with). We always crated him when guests came over, because it wasn't worth the risk. He barked, even tho he was perfectly fine in the crate and slept there regularly. Oh well, we dealt with the barking.\n\nNTA.", "Your parents are shitty dog owners if they didn't even crate train the dog properly.", "It's because they haven't crate trained him. I have a giant 80 lb neurotic velcro dog. As we speak she's trying to figure out how to crawl in my skin because she's somehow just not close enough \ud83d\ude44.  She's been crate trained since she was a puppy. \n\nShe's also reactive and the training was a life saver. Maybe search in r/dogs for some tips you can send to your parents?  The reality is any dog can react, but if it's constant they're reactive and you need behavior training. \n\nYou're absolutely NTA.", "Then why don't they have him wear a muzzle?", "Because they didn't crate train him right. Which, BTW is a gift because at some point the dog will spend time at the vet's and will be crated and it will add a huge magnitude of stress to the dog who is supposed to be getting better.", "NTA. Imagine if you had children!? \n\nOut of curiosity, what kind of dog is it?", "Bark collar", "This exactly.", "If your parents won't even consistently tether Mickey, I guarantee they won't muzzle him.", "My dog is trained to use one of the cage muzzles. She can breathe, drink, take treats and pant freely. The only thing she can't do is bite anybody. \n\nI went extremely slowly with her because she's a very nervous dog but it took me about one week for her to get used to it, and she used to be excited when we were putting it on because it meant we were seeing people or going out of the house. \n\nIf they refuse to do training, refuse to muzzle the dog, and refuse to find somewhere else for the dog to be then I wouldn't go. They put their own selfish desires over the possibility of a serious bite and that's not okay.", "If they can't keep him on a leash or in a crate for more than an hour I can't imagine they would be on board with a muzzle. Even if they agree you know you'll turn around at some point and they'll have taken it off.", "NTA. I have worked with rescues and I specialize in high anxiety dogs and dogs who have aggression. What your parents are doing is dangerous. Both for their dog and those visiting in their home. Part of being a dog owner, especially owning a dog with aggression issues, is knowing your dog, their triggers, quirks, and what they can and cannot tolerate. Their dog cannot tolerate others in the home. Period. That is the way their dog is. They need to set him up for success by not having him out when other are in the home. And not just tethered in the room, this dog needs to be locked up in a different room away from everyone. One of these days, and it will happen given their flippant responses to you and others who have raised very valid concerns, the dog is going to bite someone and injure someone to the point of needing medical care. Then a report gets made, the dog is seized and put down, and they will be on the hook for legal fees, medical bills and possibly a lawsuit. They are playing a dangerous game of roulette with their guests and their dog. And everyone will lose when this comes to a head. Not if, but when. I currently have a dog that had a rough life before he came to me. He can only be around 2 other people on this planet, besides me,, that happen to reside in the home with me. If anyone is coming over, he goes up to my bedroom, with his water and food bowl. I turn the TV on for him and check on him every hour or so. If he has to use the bathroom, our guests go and hang out in our finished basement until he is secure in my room again. It is not ideal, it can be a pain in the behind, but I love him and care about the safety of the guests in my home. Everyone is safe. That is the responsibility I have taken on and I take it seriously. You absolutely should not feel any guilt in keeping yourself safe. Your plan sounds like a good one. Just have the conversation now with your parents before the holiday is closer.", "Did you take a picture of yourself in your mangled blouse?  It\u2019s a great reminder.", "You're NTA at all but they probably won't and shouldn't board their dog this Christmas if you're in the US. There's a really scary respiratory virus for dogs going around. No one should be boarding dogs until they figure this out. \n\nYou're totally NTA though and your parents are horrible for letting this dog's behavior go on like this. Someone is going to be severely injured someday and your parents will be liable....", "yeah sounds like he was probably abused by bigger person but unless shelter saw him come in contact with that they probably didn\u2019t know to be aware of it. poor baby some humans are trash and shouldn\u2019t have dogs. i\u2019m glad you don\u2019t hate mickey. but it\u2019s only right to keep guest safe they run the risk of someone turning mickey in for biting them if they don\u2019t limit his contact with others or try to train him. they aren\u2019t doing anyone any favors including mickey. but glad he is in a better situation then he was", "They have a restraint for the dog, so if it's small and unlikely to break free or something, then I don't think there's an issue here.", "Have they talked to their vet about this? There are anxiety medications they can try. \n\nUltimately it sounds like your parents don\u2019t actually believe he\u2019s dangerous and don\u2019t want to put any effort into changing things.", "Fair enough. Still think about the fact that this animal lives with your parents and you asking to board, tether or hide a family member away makes you the AH", "That doesn't make any sense. If the dog is restrained while OP is there, then what is the issue??", "This dog is always not going to be safe around young kids. That's why we step in to stop the behavior on both sides. However, these are not my kids and I can only ask they leave her be. I do give her a safe space to be away from them if they won't stop pestering her.", "Some dogs simply cannot be crate trained. We've had a couple \u2013 they just had too much trauma, and crating them only caused them more trauma. It's helpful if dogs can be crate trained, primarily because they may have to be in an emergency, but it is *not* essential, and not doing so doesn't make people bad dog owners. Not even trying to work with a qualified trainer or animal behaviorist to help an aggressive dog, on the other hand, absolutely *does* make people bad dog owners. And OP's parents are really shitty dog owners.", "It sounds like no training of any kind has taken place with this pup. It's usually the humans who need to get some training first, and that's the case here.", "I agree - basket muzzles let dogs drink, but they cannot bite with them in place.", "Op should copy your post and send it to her parents. Well said!", "Read my comment about the young mama getting her nose 1/2 bit off and other multiple stitches. If your untrained dog shows aggression (bit and tore her shirt) that is a RED FLAG!  No the dog has not bitten someone bad enough for someone to need stitches but that scenario is coming like a runaway train!", "The family member is a violent animal. For them to choose a biting dog over their own daughter might be their right, but it absolutely makes them assholes.", "Most family members don't get violent with and bite their guests. This is manifestly a false equivalence.", "The issue is that the parents have let the dog off leash before if he is \u201cbehaving well.\u201d OP fears they they will do this again, since they have already minimized her fears and not taken her seriously when she asked them to remove the animal.", "Restraints break, and regardless.. Who can relax and be comfortable in a room with an animal that wants to bite them? Went to a dudes house to pickup some weed with a friend and dude had two large dogs in appropriate metal crates. One was just vibing, but the other was in a warped cage he was chewing on. That's when I saw the *already chewed through broken cage in the hallway and then made eye contact with that foamy mouthed dog*.\n\n\nI waited in the damn car.\n\n\n I have a dog. I love animals. Large, small, doesn't matter. If it has teeth and has shown aggression toward me I will not be around it. It's a concept called \"I love myself and my life\".", "The dog is dangerous and needs an anti bite basket muzzle at minimum.", "Thank you. I love dogs. People...not as much lol. But I HATE irresponsible dog owners that put their animal and others at risk.", "This isn't Cujo. I think if OP was dealing with a dog that chews through cages and foams at the mouth, she would have mentioned that.", "All dogs that bite are Cujo. \n\n\nYou can keep pretending you don't know why OP has a valid concern, but it's kinda dumb tbh. For who? Just to be controversial? No one is an asshole for not wanting to get bit by a dog that already bitten before and has already gone for them.", "They can restrain the dog. They've done it before. Asking them to board it is unreasonable when all they have to do is not let the dog off the tether ffs.", "Like I said, you can stay dumb."]}
