You wrote that it's a regular thing and the adults talk among themselves, not really caring - or noticing - what happens at the \"kids section.\" As someone who was among the eldest among my generation in the family, I know that this can get tiring fast, especially if there aren't a lot of kids sharing your age around and you're expected by default to assume childcare duties or keep the little ones occupied as a stand-in child entertainer.  \n\n\nThat sucks and makes these family get-togethers awful things that just make you grumpy and angry. I'm guessing you know that since I notice that you didn't stay to console the crying kid, opting to escape yourself. So while he shouldn't be mean to a 4-year-old, your parents and family shouldn't be expecting a 16-year-old to be a small kid's entertainer and be happy about it. It's just a sucky situation and I assume your brother has decided he's done with it :/  \nMaybe tell him that making a few non-committal noises and some minimum attention to the little cousin is really all that's needed? Or ask your aunt/uncle to entertain their kid from time to time? Or maybe even just offer a shoulder to vent after/before the get-togethers so he can blow off some steam.
