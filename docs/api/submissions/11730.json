You wrote that it's a regular thing and the adults talk among themselves, not really caring - or noticing - what happens at the \"kids section.\" As someone who was among the eldest among my generation in the family, I know that this can get tiring fast, especially if there aren't a lot of kids sharing your age around and you're expected by default to assume childcare duties or keep the little ones occupied as a stand-in child entertainer.  \n\n\nThat sucks and makes these family get-togethers awful things that just make you grumpy and angry. I'm guessing you know that since I notice that you didn't stay to console the crying kid, opting to escape yourself. So while he shouldn't be mean to a 4-year-old, your parents and family shouldn't be expecting a 16-year-old to be a small kid's entertainer and be happy about it. It's just a sucky situation and I assume your brother has decided he's done with it :/  \nMaybe tell him that making a few non-committal noises and some minimum attention to the little cousin is really all that's needed?

Kids are also notoriously zigzaggy cyclers.  \n\n\nJust like being pet free doesn't mean you are cruel to pets, the same goes for childfree.", "You can probably thank reddit for turning this kid into an idiot, you know he learned it on here with all the crazy childfree people threads. On reddit, childfree means hatred of children and ignoring their existence", "I\u2019m honestly a little sick of these AITA child free posts. Deciding to be child free does not mean completely banning any and all interaction or acknowledgement that kids live in their world. OP is NTA but his little brother is an AH in the making.", "This. I'm childfree as fuck and hope to remain so, but if my best friend's tiny human wants to tell me about every time she blinked at school yesterday, by golly I'm gonna listen.\n\nNot everyone has to be that dedicated, but like, don't be a stupid fartface.", "I'm child-free but I still love my nieces, nephews, and my friend's kids. It just means I also love going home to my quiet apartment and being a crazy cat lady with my fianc\u00e9 lol.", "I thought this is what child free people meant because their comment usually reek with hatred and contempt for children. Bunch of weirdos.", "Or just leave him out of the next family gathering \u201cthere will be kids there and wanted to respect your child free position\u201d", "OP PLEASE DO THIS", "that's a lot of assumptions of brandon's life.", "All these teenagers using psychological terms like they know what they're talking about.", "I think he\u2019s more than likely just indoctrinated in some child free propaganda", "Thank you. It's usually girls who are socialized this way, but if it's just Brandon being sick of being assigned babysitting duties- no problem with his actions.", "I agree.  I'd say OP is NTA, but his brother isn't required to spend time with their cousin if he doesn't want to.  I would say that his brother is being an asshole, but he is under no obligation to spend time with or interact with the cousin if he doesn't want to.", "Who says that kid is not aggravating the shit right out of him? Pulling at his clothes, jumping on his lap etc etc. I\u2019ve had that happen to me and I just to shut that right down and walk away. Yeah they cried. I don\u2019t care. They should have left me alone. I learned how to \u201cGreyrock\u201d.", "SO MUCH THIS - c\u2019mon!", "Exactly!!!!\u2019", "It honestly seems like 4 year old cousin lives with them and just annoys Brandon.", "Thank goodness I am not the only one who is on the kids side. He shouldn't be the defacto babysitter. If this person is SO concerned about Brandon not wanting to hang with the toddler then they can step up and keep the niece entertained. Some people (myself included) just find children extremely taxing to be around.", "SERIOUSLY. this is like the third post i\u2019ve seen this week (it\u2019s Tuesday) that involves someone being childfree and an asshole. and i\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a coincidence that half the posts blatantly state, \u201ci\u2019m childfree and i refuse to be around kids.\u201d i get certain controversial subjects become bait for awhile, but damn, can we stop feeding this bs?", "Do people actually buy that in real life?", "The little asshole is OP for trying to force her brother to hang out with and entertain a child.", "I completely agree, if OP is so concerned he should spend time with the 4 year old.", "I think someone treating any member of their family (or really any person who is not a stranger) the way he\u2019s treating his cousin is incredibly cruel and rude. \u201cSorry grandma, I\u2019m going to refuse to acknowledge your existence when we are in the same room because I just have no interest in old people.\u201d It\u2019s not just that she\u2019s a child.", "He's not required to love any family member, kid or not. He tries several times to disengage from the child because he doesn't want to be around her - kids can be overwhelming especially when the adults just shove anyone under 18 together and then the older kids get stuck entertaining and caring for the younger kids. He could have handled it better but he is 16 and still figuring social intricacies out. If OP feels the niece needs attention so bad then they can take over and lavish the toddler with affection and listen to whatever it wants to say.", "Glad to see someone taking a neutral take. Kids of all ages have to learn to entertain themselves.", "The sight of children makes childfree people go psycho. I think thats not childfree, thats something else entirely though.", "Probably a combo of the two", "Agreed, NAH", "DNA doesn't make you family, mutual love, respect and connection does, and that is quite clearly lacking in this situation. You can never force or obligate someone to form a bond with you and clearly, the brother doesn't wanna form a bond, so they aren't family. To OP's brother, he isn't rejeting his family, he's just rejecting a random kid that he happens to share DNA with.", "I do class myself as child-free because even I can't have children, I wouldn't have wanted them and it is a bit of a reaction to the maudlin sympathy some people feel they must give you as a barren woman, you know one who has no purpose in the world. It is a bit of a loaded term doing a lot of duties. It's a choice as much as a necessity.\n\nI am not child-friendly in wanting to interact with them but recognise that they are children, deserve to be about and they will be bored/noisy/chaotic, am willing to listen to colleagues/friends about them and will engage if need to. I'd be speaking to this little girl, especially as looking at her drawings is easy to do.\n\nEdit: Still feel that if the brother doesn't want to engage, forcing him isn't going to do any good. He's a teen and they have enough to work through.", "Eih.... being around my brother's three 4-6 year olds when I was 15 was enough to realize I didn't want kids. Now that they're adults and don't require maintenance,  they're a lot more fun. Wondering if the cousin or multiple cousins have been pawned off on the 16 to entertain so that adults can adult \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I half wonder, though, if he\u2019s the youngest of the oldest and had been saddled with chilling or \u201cplaying\u201d with the youngest. I had that feeling for a number of reasons and I get it.\n\nI could be totally wrong, but that\u2019s the vibes I get.", "But that's a choice you have made, not a requirement you make of someone who has given advance notice they aren't willing to be around someone", ">I like the surely 16 year old that leaves me alone\n\nAh yes the 16 year old that \u201cleaves you alone\u201d \n\nAt least I know you weren\u2019t lying when you said you were child-free", "That's more childless (wanting kids but not having them) than childfree (not wanting kids and not having them).", "This is my exact experience. I'm infertile and thought it would be a way to meet other people who don't have or don't want kids. Nope, it was a bunch of bitter assholes loathing the existence of children. I'm not a kid person but I'm not mean to them either. Love my niblings and my friend's kids.", "Age is only a protected class for 40 years of age or older. Not arguing, just informing.", "That's not what childfree means! It means not wanting to be a parent, not to not be around kids.", "My country's government is actively making it extremely difficult for women to not be forced to endure pregnancy and childbirth and remain childfree if that's what they want. When society is attacking your bodily autonomy at every angle and even making it hard to sterilize yourself or have access to birth control, it's hard not to view the consequence of pregnancy with some level of hostility or disgust, no matter how irrational those feelings are.", "That could be, but it\u2019s still not ok to take that out on his cousin. I\u2019m the second youngest of all my siblings and cousins, and I got all of their angst towards various parents dumped on me when I was just a little kid. He needs to take it up with his parents if that\u2019s happening. But it sounds like there are no consequences when he ignores her or leaves the room, so that makes me dubious that he\u2019s just trying to break away from some sort of role he\u2019s been put in", "I think people aren't in the wrong of they think negatively of you for how you act in social situations.\n\nNothing in life is technically a requirement. But even if you're right about what you don't have to do, it doesn't mean others will just be okay with it.\n\nHaving a slight amount of patience for someone, especially someone who is just starting to socially develop is just something that will make your life easier.", "Nope. Sure wasn't. The 16 year old gets boundaries.", "I've seen them legit complain that there are children at..... Disney World. Being child free is fine. Loving Disney as an adult is fine (avid Disney lover here). Going to a place that is marketed primarly for children and then complaining that children are present is just wild to me.", "Are you sure it's not other 16yr olds who make those posts there? Lol", "They call parents \"breeders\" what the actual fuck? I totally understand if someone doesn't want children but that?", "They think childfree means child hating, and that babies and children should be hidden as to not inconvenience any adults. As if children exist to spite them.", "I have not! I'm not entirely sure how my algorithm started throwing me random anti-natalist posts as I have a kid and I'm an early childhood educator.  I have friends who are childfree and I'm glad that decision is being normalized now- I see a lot of people who should never have had children. At work and I hope people that don't want to can not feel societal pressure to have them.", "Yeah I agree. And unfortunately in my last relationship I thought I could walk that line of being ambivalent, but she was _really_ passionate about having kids (and lots of them) - and unfortunately that doesn\u2019t work as a couple!", "Omg that is amazing! Congratulations I\u2019m so happy for you! From someone who is CF but loves kids!", "What we all need to find is a way to stop the constant pressure to have children. I hate it when coworkers or even strangers start in on someone about having kids, especially in public places. Whether you want to have kids in the future is your own business. You shouldn't need to find a magic phrase. Of course, I myself am also in search of a magic phrase, one that says \"it's pretty unlikely that I'll be able to have kids\" but that also somehow conveys \"I do not want to discuss my medical history with you, I just can't sit here quietly and listen to you bully someone else about it.\"", "I\u2019m not saying being unhinged is correct, but being beaten over the head with \u201cyou must have children\u201d by everyone you know is exhausting and I can see how it can drive people to be extreme. I had to resort to being a absolute jerk or also wildly inappropriate in response to get people to quit asking.", "Funny that you mention veganism, because I also try and eat vegan when I can - but I almost never actually mention it to anyone because they\u2019ll just assume that I\u2019m going to start throwing food on the floor and screeching about animal murder. I eat vegan when the option is present, but I\u2019m also not going to make a special case just for myself. So if I go to a party or get together where there aren\u2019t any vegan options, I\u2019ll just eat it anyways. The food\u2019s already there, and while I abhor the treatment of animals in that industry, I abhor waste even more and I\u2019d rather eat non-vegan food than have it be thrown away. \n\nBut to your point about parents, I\u2019ve found that the really obnoxious child free people also pitch a fit if parents even mention their kids. Guess what, as parents, a large part of their life revolves around their children - you\u2019re going to hear about them. Some parents can obviously take it way too far, but them just mentioning their kids at all is enough so set some people off and it\u2019s pathetic", "I am childfree, never wanted kids my whole life. I work in early childhood education :p", "Yeah my husband's aunt is child free and freaking adores our son", "Hey, pretty similar situation here! I'm 23 and married but my husband and I both have genetic issues (ex. I have arthritis, bone spurs and degenerative disc disease in my spine to name a few) so we decided we didn't want to pass on our crappy genetics to a kid when there are so many who need homes anyway.\n\nWe won't adopt, for a mix of financial and other reasons, and cannot foresee ever raising a kid. But I LOVE kids, like *really* love kids! They're cute as the sun is bright but pretty much everything worked against us in regards to having kids.\n\nLast year I had a tubal ligation; the plan was originally to have an IUD but lo' and behold, I have a misshapen uterus (forgot the term, but it's heart-shaped basically) which would make it impossible for an IUD to be inserted, as well as an increased risk for pregnancy complications such as stillbirth. The gynecologist who saw me and did the surgery was incredibly understanding towards me, considering I am still very young and I know that makes me a \"regret risk\" basically, but she also adopted all of her kiddos so reassured me that not carrying my own isn't the end-all be-all :)", "With adults though, right? I get that and sometimes it's necessary, but we're talking about an interaction with a little girl.", "I'm just trying to explain logic to you.  The difference of opinion isn't at issue.  If you care about the child, you comfort the child is very basic logic.", "I was dubbed the cool \"aunt\" for my friend's kid from the moment I met him when he was 3. Kid's mom was all \"auntie annarchy will buy you your first beer and go to clubs with you!\" He's almost 21 now, so...I need to step up to my responsibilities, I guess! \n\nSeriously, though, I am not the person to babysit but I am the person a kid can talk to about anything and the person who gets baby Doc Martens as a first present for my friends' babies.", "Unfortunately this sub is basically roulette for how it reacts to certain topics", "I actually can't remember the last time there was a child around me misbehaving. I've heard babies cry, but not excessively or without it being addressed by the parents... and no problems with children old enough to walk and talk. The \"shocking number\" of parents is 0.\n\nUnless this is some uniquely American thing, I find it hard to believe that people on reddit are encountering shitty parents with demon children soooo often that it's reasonable for them to hate children over it.", "Yet, again I understand what you\u2019re saying, I don\u2019t agree with you. Your \u201clogic\u201dis yours\u2026 not everyone has the same instinct and urges to go comfort a child. Especially since the child is not hurt. So yea, your logic is an opinion and it definitely falls under differences in opinion.", "Kudos to your mom for the support!", "I don\u2019t want kids of my own and generally am kind of weird with babies (better at about 1.5-2 hrs when they\u2019re more engaging imo) but holy shit are baby & toddler shoes the cutest. First thing I bought when I found out my brother was gonna be a dad was snag some classic babies adidas - soft soles & a size range that are expected to fit right around when they\u2019re at least standing & trying to walk, if not already walking (the reviews said they were perfect for starter walkers)", "I\u2019m American and have almost never seen this crazy kid behavior that people complain about, so . . .", "LOL  If the child is not hurt then WTF is everyone making such a big deal about?\n\nLogic and opinions are very different animals.  Your logic now makes sense, given that your opinion is that the child isn't hurt.  I have to assume everyone else who agrees with just going after the brother and ignoring the child has that same horrifying opinion that they are basing their logic on."]}
