Calling him mean and discussing how his behavior affects others is warranted, but saying he isn\u2019t child free is doing nothing to convince him of that. Considering how often child free people have others doubt or deny their position, it\u2019s probably going to make him double down and listen to you less. Honestly it looks like it already has.\n\n I do think he himself misunderstands what child free means. Not wanting his own children doesn\u2019t mean he can opt out of engaging with them ever.

They treated him with respect whether or not they wanted kids themselves.\n\nBrandon is not a parent. He is, however, a human, and is obligated to treat other humans with as much respect as he would like to receive. \n\nIt is also really awful for the child to get a cold response like that.

It would be reasonable to say he\u2019s not going to babysit anytime they want or something like that. But interacting with your own cousin when everyone\u2019s hanging out is just being family, and refusing to do so is just being a jerk.", "It doesn't excuse his behavior, but I knew by 11 I never wanted kids. I didn't know what to call it until I was in college - but I was very much childfree before I was even a teenager.", "That\u2019s not passing the care on to anyone else though. You don\u2019t know that the parents aren\u2019t also engaging with the child. The child doesn\u2019t have to engage with just their parents.

Are you also a \"nongolfer\" or \"nonvegan\". \n\nAlso announcing big life decisions when you are a kid is a great way for adults not to take you seriously. \n\nMaybe this is just the old man in me, thinking back to how I was many things I got wrong projecting my future self out. Sure some things I did get right but I really don't get the need to announce that decision at that age. Its also I guess not that big of a deal because if you change your mind, its not like you are held to previous statements.", "Again, if they dont notice it going on, despite it being an ongoing issue then how are they caring for their child?  I can see someone missing it once, but the OP refers to it happening more then that."]}
