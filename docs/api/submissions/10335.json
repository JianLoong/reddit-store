Then we had a falling out with the landlord and got our own place since we didn't want to live with strangers. Around the same time she was diagnosed with cancer.  She's a great person and I really and truly was just trying to help her thru a difficult situation and help get her independence back. We were in our mid 40s at the time. Her daughter was very independent and dependable so she moved with us. To make a long story shorter 5 yrs later she's still battling cancer and we are a couple now, even talked about getting married. \n\nThe problem is she expects me to help her kids financially from time to time..most of the time even the ones who dont live with us and the daughter who lives with us has become very undependable and we count on her for a share of the rent. Did I mention she also moved in her adult son who has schizophrenia and is a severe alcoholic with legal issues. Who she enables with my paycheck behind my back. \n\nBasically am I the asshole for wanting to focus on her and expecting her kids to manage they're own problems. I'm not their father and they have no problem sticking me with the Bill's when paying is inconvenient.  I expect nothing from them since from what I've seen they put themselves first and her second. I dont want to pay their Bill's, buy their groceries,  or pay for their smokes when they went and pissed their money away. All our financial problems are due to her inability to show them tough love. I get that they had a rough child hood and she had an abusive husband, but that's no excuse to treat me the way they do. I'm working 2 jobs 65 hrs a week to make ends meet and still can't catch up. I make over 78,000 at one job and the other job brings in 300 a week extra. \n\nI'm put my foot down, took a stand a few days ago.  I know she's not well , especially lately and she's making impulsive emotional decisions,  but if we continue her way we will lose the house and it will ruin me financially. I know there's more important things than money, but money buys, food, shelter and stability. That's all I want for us.  Her son is a high functioning schizophrenic, he's not dumb or incapable of taking care of himself he just wont and she enables him. Putting a roof over his head and a house full of groceries is enough. I dont have to do more than that. \n\nOn a side note, because of all this I have carried around the same debt I had when I met her. It gotten worse for sure.  I thought we could sort all these issues out and make a life. I think I might have to move on, but she has no income and I wont leave her homeless. I'm thinking we should go back to being friends so I can reset boundaries with her kids and we can all eventually move on. I dont have 40 more working years left in me. \n\nAm I The Ahole?", "created_utc": 1676753794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115qxcw/aita_im_supporting_my_girlfriend_who_has_cancer_i/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Explain you can\u2019t afford to pay for others than her, explain that you need to be saving for retirement and for her medical care. I wouldn\u2019t come at this accusatory or say anything about what her parenting strategy might have been, just stick to facts: what\u2019s currently happening isn\u2019t sustainable. \n\nTalk about your living arrangements, and if you want to take a step back from the relationship, that makes sense. I would say that you might just want to be prepared in case that step back turns into a step away.", "NTA. Don't marry her. It would give her even more access to your money, when you're already struggling to support them. If you want to stay with her, eliminate all access she has to your bank accounts, even if that means opening new accounts.", "NTA, but changing your relationship status back to friends isn't going to fix these problems. You need to set your boundaries with her: you will not support her adult children. Period. It would be best if they moved out of your home, so they're not increasing your bills and presenting you with their own. \n\nShe needs to make a choice here. Right now you're being too much of a doormat, and she knows you won't actually enforce the boundaries because you care about her. I know she's sick, but show her what tough love -emphasis on the love- looks like. \n\nIf you lose your home and ability to support yourself, she's going to fail too.", "NTA just the doormat.  Going back to roomies might be your best solution until you find a way out.  You have absolutely no obligation to her kids, they seem to just use and abuse.", "NTA. If you can separate your finances. Pay your bills and don't give her access to the money.  Time to have a very frank Convo with her. You will lose the house and be homeless while she is in treatment. This will be a major issue and could shorten her life dramatically.\n\nIf she can get SSI, apply for it.  Same for son if he has such issues.\n\nAnd gotta tell her kids, no pay no stay. Unfortunately she's in a terrible situation.  Don't prevent them from seeing her, but they can't live without paying.", "NTA And in case you need to hear this, people with disabilities, chronic illnesses, etc. can still be assholes. Her having cancer doesn't excuse her behavior in regards to her children.", "NTA, she needed to do this a long time ago, and did you. You\u2019re going to work and stress yourself to death.", "NTA. Please draw firm boundaries and take care of yourself.", "This woman and her kids are parasites. Grow a spine and get rid of them.

How are you paying adult children's *bills* and not getting paid back?\n\nThis isn't how most people baby their adult children.

Who owns the house you are living in?\n\nI would separate the finances. Who is buying the groceries? I would be open with your girlfriend that you won't finance the life of 3 other adults and are only able to support her. Buy the groceries on your own and only give her some pocket money and that's it. For the kids: No idea how you can get them out again. Maybe it's cheaper to offer them to pay for their own flat for the first months until they have their own income?\n\nNo idea, very difficult situation. \nDon't marry her!", "NTA", "NTA. You are not a bank for her kids. Cancer or not, she is kind of a jerk for putting you in this position.", "Nta\nMove out", "NTA.   And if she\u2019s using your money to support/help her kids you need to cut her access to a minimum.  With the ongoing cancer she\u2019s probably not thinking/behaving rationally towards her kids.

She may not realize what it's doing to you in the meantime.  It's not because she doesn't care but because she can only process so much.", "NTA obviously but that's not really the issue here, is it? I've known people in a very similar situation - mom is sick, kids say they'll help and end up taking advantage. This situation with your gf and her kids will never change. They will always try to take advantage of her and she will always let them. Maybe she's a good person and doesn't want to see you taken advantage of, or maybe she doesn't care; either way, she will always let her kids take advantage of you. You probably don't want to leave her while she's sick, that's admirable, but just know that this is going to go on as long as she's in your life.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI think you need to accept you just aren\u2019t compatible. You can\u2019t ask her to choose between you and her children, she\u2019ll always choose them- as she clearly has time and time again. You need to accept this relationship is over before you end up bankrupted by her choices.", "NTA...not at all.  cut off those free loading kids", "NTA. You need to cut off her access to your money. With the amount of money you make you should be debt free.", "NTA", "NTA honestly I wouldn\u2019t even want to take care of her at this point if she\u2019s putting her kids on you too that\u2019s not your responsibility. I would put your foot down and let them know that her daughter needs to move out since she\u2019s not supporting herself and pulling her way in this house and if your girlfriend doesn\u2019t like it then she needs to leave too. It sounds like they\u2019re using you.", "Thank you good advice, I definitely do not want to accuse her or make any despagaging comments of any kind towards her or her family.  It's just gotten out of control.", "She's never had access", "Your right and I am. I started a few days ago and I need to see it thru. I'm going to see it thru.", "I get that, fair point. Stress causes people to make decisions they normally wouldn't.  It's hard to get back from that.", "We lost her SS benefits 2 yrs ago due to a technicality bureaucratic nightmare..We have lawyers working on it but it's a long process. The pandemic didn't help. I've been trying to hold it together while that gets back on track.", "I have to learn ....saying no is not being controlling.", "Basically her adult daughter has been coming up short the last few months she's on the lease to.  and I've had no choice but to cover the rent on our house. I'm not getting evicted. Lease is up in June. I will let it lapse if everyone doesn't get it together. \n\nIf all goes south I'll rent my own place and she's welcome to come along as long as boundaries are respected. I won't leave her homeless. It will be up to her what she decides. My girlfriend that is, the daughter is on her own.", "I did set boundaries too late, I was a bit immature/naive when I met here, I'm not anymore.  I thought with my help everyone was capable of getting their shit together, I was wrong.And  She's doing her best under difficult circumstances. She's not blameless, but I know all too well stress causes bad decision making.", "I guess I'm gonna find out, I'm not asking her to choose that would be rediculas. But she can choose to set reasonable boundaries and respect the sacrifices I've made. If she can't then then I would accept your conclusion.", "I think by also keeping it not about her family it better establishes your position - you're her partner but not their dad. She's allowed to make whatever decisions she wants about her involvement in their lives and support them in the ways she can, but well. You aren't really involved in that, and as partners you need to be on the same page about your financial future.", "Just seconding Duckie's advice above, they said it better than I would.", "\u2018who she enables with my paycheck behind my back\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re doing all this to yourself op.", "You stated she uses your paycheck to help her kids behind your back.", "Then more than ever get those finances separate.", "Get your own bank account that she doesn't have access to.  Stop letting your GF control you.", "If things don\u2019t change you shouldn\u2019t let her move in with you again. She\u2019ll co to use to manipulate you to get you to bail out her kids", "OK but she might bring her kids with her. And I'd be wary about giving her money because she will give it to them behind your back like she's already doing.", "OP, can you move out to a one bedroom place , and leave the kids behind? Make it crystal clear that you will NOT be supporting them, going forward?", "I don't blame her. They are her kids. Kids come first. Of course she tries to support them even if she has to abuse your trust for this.\n\nBut giving them money will not help the kids to be independent again. So really not an easy situation. But your health needs to come first. Don't work 65h. Getting burnout or a heart attack isn't helping anybody. And I wonder who would care for you if this would happen. I really hope, she is still a good girlfriend and not only stays with you because of the money.", "They actually are, I control all the money, but I try to balance her needs with mine. I dont want her to feel like I'm controlling her. It's become toxic anyway.", "Unfortunately her kids are taking advantage of her during her illness."]}
