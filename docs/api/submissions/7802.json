I vowed I would never go to the extreme with my child.\n\nI took a slightly opposite route, something I have stuck with since my 12 year old was a baby.  If I make something she's never had before she has to eat 3 bites of it before she can say she doesn't like something.  I am a believer that you can't always know for sure in that first bite, but by 3 you should know.  I do make side dishes I know she likes along with it, just in case, and so she doesn't go hungry.  I do stick to my mom's rule that my kitchen isn't a resturant, and I'm not a short order cook.  Meaning I make one meal, that's it.  If you don't like it, sorry.  That's why I always make sure that only one portion of the meal is new, while the starch, and veggie are things I know she likes so I know she'll eat something on her plate.\n\nWell I just got grief for making my daughter try 3 bites before saying she doesn't like something.  We had dinner with some sort of friends.  I say sort of because we don't know them well.  The main dish was somerhing she's never tried before.  She kind of gave it a funny look (so did I because I've had it before with other people, and I wasn't a fan, but everyone has different tastes).  My daughter tried one bite, and shock her head at me.  I reminded her of the rule, while I ate my quickly to not offend the host too much.  My daughter took her next two bites, and shock her head at me again.  I nodded, and told her to eat the other food on the plate, mashed potatoes, and peas (yuck but my daughter loves peas).  After dinner the husband got mad that I didn't make my daughter eat everything on her plate.

Good rule. A+.\n\nForcing people to clean their plate is how eating disorders start. Forcing 3 bites seems fair. \n\nMay want to work with her on not offending hosts but that can come later. Also what kind of host gets upset that a kid didn\u2019t like their food?", "NTA I call these no thank you bites. I still do this at 37, even when I know it's something I'm not a fan of, maybe I like how this new person makes it. Like I generally hate meatloaf but love mine and my mom's. \n\nIt builds an adventurous eater.", "lolll man some people be too fuckin bored \n\nNTA - if you and your kid are cool with it, it's fine", "As someone who grew up an extremely picky eater, I think your rule is a fair compromise. I like that you also include sides that you know she will always eat so that way if after 3 bites of the main meal she doesn\u2019t want anymore, she has other things to eat so as not to go hungry. \n\nYou are good not to follow your parents original rule of clearing your plate no matter what (especially if for whatever the reason the child doesn\u2019t like the taste/texture of the food) as that I can assure creates major anxiety and stress around mealtime and a child will shut down and not eat at all eventually and could create an even worse situation overall. I would know this firsthand as it happened to me. \n\nBut anyways, NTA.", "NTA and also you're pretty much the perfect parent. Thinking about parenting lucidly, looking fot the balance between not indulging and not coddling, actually listening to your child and also considering others' input (even if they are idiotic meddlers). And also at least trying to cultivate a broad palate.", "NTA\n\nIt is a common rule among parents, and one I enforced with my own kids.  If I made food, you ate 3 bites to get a good taste.  If it had been a while since you last had it?  You got three bites again to try it.  Tastes change.   My son HATED plenty of food at a young age, but the rule was 3 bites and over time, he ended up LOVING things he hated at a younger age.\n\nIt is three bites, not a full serving.  3 bites.", "Info: How many times, if ever, has she disliked something for two bites, and then changed her mind and liked it after the third bite?", "NTA\n\nYour principle is overall good and I think it gives to your kid a nice opportunity to grow and take informed decisions.\n\nYou make sure she will always have food to eat.\n\nJust out of curiosity, did she ever said no at the first bite and changed idea by the third bite?", "I lol'd at this one. One asks why you didn't make her finish, the other wonders why you made her take 3 bites. I think you have a decent rule there. At her age you might talk to her about taking one for the team now and then if you're at someone's house for dinner. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I love this approach. You're teaching her to try new foods, but not forcing her to eat when she doesn't want it. I think this is a really great way of teaching healthy eating habits. I agree that three bites as opposed to one bite is completely reasonable, and it's something you consistently enforce.", "NTA.  Sounds reasonable.  I would never have commented like those people did as this is your child not theirs.  Also, as parents, we all have to come up with some standard and this is yours (and, like I said, imo reasonable.)\nFor the record (and don't really need it anymore as my kid is in jh and isn't a particularly picky eater) has always been to try it on a second occasion if he doesn't like it on the first try.  After the 2nd try no more are necessary.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s dumb to make people everything on their plate. We\u2019re allowed to have preferences. The wife seemed okay that your daughter didn\u2019t like it. \n\nI think in the future it would be a good idea to establish a game plan for when you\u2019re in public and she wants to let you know subtly she didn\u2019t like something she tried if you\u2019re worried about awkward situations.", "NTA, I think it\u2019s good middle ground between having a child who refuses to try new things and having a child who\u2019s forced to eat everything. \n\nI think at this age she probably gets the gist of it and is pretty open to trying new foods, I think you can probably relax the rule here or there if she really isn\u2019t a fan.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think you should have to eat everything on your plate if a host makes a plate for you with items you don\u2019t enjoy. If you make your own plate, it\u2019s intentionally wasteful and should be avoided.", "Mild YTA. At 12, she's old enough to know when she doesn't like something. She's also old enough to have bodily autonomy. My rule is that if my daughter doesn't like what I serve, she can make something else for herself.", "NAH, except husband for being weirdly controlling about food intake of another human. You all just have different philosophies. I subscribe to: we should treat kids like whole humans capable of making decisions of what does into their bodies, with some limits. I turned down a daycare last week who have the \u201cyou must take a bite of your food\u201d policy. But you\u2019re NTA for having your own household rules. Just how confusing for your kid to hear from multiple people that night about how she should be eating instead of being allowed to just listen to her own body.", "\u201cThis is the rule we follow wirh our child.\u201d No other comment needed.

I would keep a wary eye on these \u2018sort of friends\u2019 - they sound like people who can\u2019t keep their opinions to themselves, which is a red flag in someone you don\u2019t know very well.", "Eh light YTA. The logic that it has to be 3 bites instead of just 1 is just absurd to me. Like it\u2019s just strange and unusual IMO. One bite should be enough. But then again\u2026 I\u2019m someone who is sensitive to food and textures and will literally throw up if forced to eat something I know I\u2019m not going to like. Sometimes kids are just difficult. Sometimes they already have food issues. It\u2019s not always in your control as the parent. \n\nForcing kids to eat foods they seem to have an aversion to has been proven to cause more food issues or food issues if they didn\u2019t already have them. Especially after they already tried it and didn\u2019t like it and you force it on them anyway.", "NTA. I grew up with the exact same kind of food rules. I only ask my older kids from the time they were about 7 to eat a bite of something before saying they don't like it. I don't make the little ones try things at all because they naturally eat pretty healthy.  I don't think three bites is excessive, but by a certain age I think you know by one bite if you don't like something.", "NTA. You have a system that seems reasonable.", "NTA. First, making kids \u201cclean\u201d their plates rather that listening to hunger cues leads to overeating. \n\nAs far as the rule is concerned, I did something similar with my kids, because I read research that kids often need to be exposed up to 20 times before they \u201clike\u201d a food. My kids were pretty adventurous, but they definitely didn\u2019t care for some things when we first introduced them (vegetables mostly). What I found was, some of the foods they declared they \u201chated\u201d, became some of their favorites. Unless there are real problems like sensory issues, I don\u2019t think we are doing kids any favors by limiting their exposure to different foods.", "NTA. From the info in your post, it doesn\u2019t seem like your daughter has a problem with this rule, which is what your primary concern should be.

As long as your child is cool with it, it's a good way to help a child get interested in new foods and really pay attention to them. There's nothing wrong with making a child have 3 bites as long as she doesn't have like sensory issues or something, but I'm sure that info would've been included if it was the case.", "That\u2019s the rule in my house. 3 bites and if 7M doesn\u2019t like it he can have cereal or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. \n\nThis has happened a total of 1 time. He will try anything, loves everything.", "NTA \n\nI did the same to my kids, and now as adults they are adventurous and are willing to try new things. They've done the same to their kids.", "NTA. Your kid, your rules. You are not asking anything unreasonable.

If they don\u2019t like it then it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s amazing how many different types of food they learned to enjoy.", "That\u2019s pretty much how I raised my kids, and they all love everything.

I'm not a fan of the one-bite rule, but three bites is just cruel. \n\nIt's one thing if the food is just bland and not great. But what if it's too spicy and makes her mouth hurt? What if there is something wrong with it (like, say, it's not cooked enough or her plate accidentally had tastable traces of dish soap on it)? What if it gives her sensory issues, or just has an ingredient or look that is bad enough to actively be sickening to her? \n\nPlease don't push this until she throws up some day. By all means, teach her how to politely decline. Give her new things to try. But accept her boundaries when she makes it clear that something is a hard no.", "NTA seams resonable.", "NTA, making a child eat the full plate of food they don't like is horrible. \nYou did a good job and the three bites makes sense. If I'm trying new food, the first bite is mostly feeling off because of the new texture and taste, but after the second bite I'm mostly sure if I like the food or not.", "Nta everyones TBs are different. Our daughter knows she has to at least TRY everything once but typically she tries it twice (different times, or different styles) she likes the rule, its fun for her. Some times a first taste surprises us and we arent sure what to think. Im still confused about Blue Moon Ice cream. \n\nAnd yea fluff her husband. I really hate wasting food but im not gonna force anyone to eat anything theyre mouth cant tolerate.", "NTA", "NTA. My friend introduced me to this exact same rule when we were like eleven.

Also, it meant that I would often try different sauces or seasonings on many foods to find ways that I could like them.\n\nAlso now, as an adult, I\u2019m inclined to try everything on my plate whether I think I\u2019ll like it or not, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m that way!

I always make my 6yo try everything at least once. There are certain things I know, without a doubt, she will not eat (Indian food, mushrooms, peppers), and I don't force it or serve them to her. But I think it's really important for children to try everything at least once (unless it's spicy).\n\nA parenting tidbit I adopted from my parents, is that if a plate of food is served to a child, they are absolutely not required to eat it all. However, if a child fills their own plate, they are required to eat every last bite. Whether that's at the table all together, or over the course of an evening (if we're talking dinner). So if my kid serves herself, and doesn't finish it, but gets hungry later, she has to finish what she served herself before she gets anything else.", "NTA good approach.

The three bite rule is well known as a tactic to see if you really don't like something - not just with kids but everyone. The husband demanding a child (THAT IS NOT EVEN HIS OWN) clean their plate is weird and controlling. The wife \\_may\\_ have just been curious but it sounds like she is just swinging the pendulum far in the opposite direction from her husband and is being judgmental about your parenting choice. Either way, both of these people are obsessed with how someone else is eating and need to get all the way off your back about it.\n\nIf it were me, I would not be eating with these humans again.", "NTA\n\nI had a similar rule, my boy had to try a completely new food every year after his birthday.  I suspect the husband had the same training as you (clean your plate). You might explain to your daughter that as she gets older, it might be more polite than three test bites especially at friends' homes. But, ultimately it's her decision and you're doing fine.", "NTA.  In our house if we didn't like something (other than the meat) we still had to eat a large spoonful of it if both our parents ate it.  If one parent didn't like it we didn't have to eat it.  Your way is just as good. They need to at least try it.", "Nta for not making her eat all of something she doesnt like, but I will say now thats shes 12 i think 3 bites are a bit much. I vomited the first time I took a bite sushi. I have a strong textural aversion to it. I clearly knew after the first bite. Your daughter os old enough that she can probably break food into strongly dislike, 3 bite food (do I like this or no?), and I like this.", "Nope NTA this is my rule (mines 2 bites but close enough) and it has really helped my picky eater discover nutritional food that she can enjoy.", "NTA. My parents used to do the \"eat everything on your plate\" rule, but when I was about fourteen , they switched to \"try three bites before saying no.\" And let me tell you: when I was forced to eat things, every meal was a miserable battle, and it got to the point where I refused to eat anything other than noodles with butter and salt. However, when my parents let up on the \"eat everything on your plate\" rule, I found myself actually enjoying trying new foods. Meals were no longer a source of misery and I was so much more comfortable eating. I still struggle with disordered eating sometimes but knowing that I could say \"no\" helped me so much. Good on you.\n\nI don't think the wife was an AH, but the husband definitely was.", "NTA and it sounds like your rule is a fair one. Also it seems like that couple don't even have a clear mentality on what raising their child will be like so that's certainly something.", "Not sure we'll be having dinner there again.  I did not like him trying to force my child to eat a full serving of a food she didn't like.  He said that my daughter was insulting his wife by not eating all her food.", "I agree with not cleaning a plate, unless a kid is allowed to serve themselves and has a habit of taking food and wasting it. Where I disagree is the 3 bites nonsense. She is twelve not 6, having rules like this around eating when she is months away from being a teenage seems a bit odd. \n\nDon\u2019t you know after one bite if you dislike a certain food? With little kids, it\u2019s a great idea to encourage trying new foods and having certain expectations at the dinner table. Teaching a kid that even if they are sure they won\u2019t like a food it is good manners, (at any age), to try one bite then politely declining if offered more. \n\nIf I went to a home for dinner and a 12 year old was forced to eat after clearly disliking something, with \u201cremember poopiekins, 3 bites, not just one! However will you know if it isn\u2019t 3? You know the rule\u201d , I would not have the bad manners to comment, but I would definitely think it a bit much. \n\nSo yeah OP, I don\u2019t necessarily think you are an asshole, but I would I would encourage to give your daughter more autonomy over her likes and dislikes. \nAlso: 12 is also a bit old for you to call out her rule following in front of new people. She sounds well behaved, so it must be kind of embarrassing for her to be treated like a younger kid around people with whom she is unfamiliar.", "Forcing food is still forcing food and still causes food issues lmao\u2026", "Yessssssss I grew up with a parent who really didn\u2019t cook well. Everything was bland and had a horrible texture. Meatloaf was one of my most hated food enemies. But my MIL made some meatloaf a couple of years ago and I tried it to be polite but holy freaking lord it was DELICIOUS.

Even I do the 3 bite rule because sometimes it's just adjusting to a new taste before being sure one way or another.

I give her the option to not eat it, or try to wipe some of the spice off, if that's possible.  You also seem to be under the impression that I'm not eating the same food she is.  If something is wrong with the food, I'm going to stop her from eating it.  Kind of one of the reasons I still precut her meat.  I'll see if it's undercooked before she even tries it.", "OP's said that they're aware their daughter doesn't like spicy foods and therefore won't serve that kind of food to their daughter/wouldn't enforce the three bite rule over something they know she doesn't like. \n\nHowever the other situations are rare to come up--not cooked enough?

Assuming OP doesn't have a dishwasher/dishwasher's broken, OP can just give daughter their plate. \n\nIn fact OP has said that the three bite rule has worked with other foods like fish (daughter said she didn't like it with bite two and then bite three it was something she liked). \n\nOP, as someone who likely would have been content with fishsticks, applesauce and broccoli for the rest of my life as a kid, NTA.", "Due to how my mom was with that, and there were times she would purposefully make foods I didn't like, I just can't bring myself to do that to my daughter.  I spent plenty of nights sitting at the table for hours with cold food in front of me.  I don't care where we are, if after 3 bites she doesn't like it, I'm not going to make her eat it.\n\nKind of off topic, but the first Thanksgiving we did with my husband's aunt, they found out my daughter didn't like turkey very much, but she still took a few small pieces.  I told her she didn't have to do that, quietly as there was plenty of other food she did like she could eat.  She told me she did it to be respectful.  I guess his aunt heard our conversation, took the turkey off her plate before I could, gave her more mashed potatoes, and peas then made a small ham the following year because my daughter loves ham.", "I don't plan on it.  More because of the husband than the wife.", "Sounds like it was a weird personal thing for him. There is not need for him to be offended on his wife\u2019s behalf. Haha", "Imagine caring what your daughter thinks about his wife\u2019s food. He is definitely TA.", "I think that\u2019s a good instinct to avoid eating with them in the future due to the father. I think your rule is a good one and it strikes a good balance as far as being polite. She gave it a fair shot, it wasn\u2019t to her taste and she was not rude about it. That\u2019s totally ok.", "He's a dick. His own wife would've preferred she only try one bite and your daughter was very polite \n\nI think as she's older one bite is likely enough.  But it is fair to insist you try something before you say you don't like it.\n\nWhen they're younger it can take multiple introductions because they're still getting used to eating and textures.  But eventually one is enough.", "It absolutely does! Particularly those with Arfid . It can be highly traumatic.", "Three bites is not forcing. But kids test their boundaries. My niece and nephew were catered two at meal times. Niece got a meal. Nephew got a meal. Then the adults have their meal. Now 4 years later, they eat NOTHING out of chicken nuggets, buttered noodles and mini pancakes. When they attempt to get her to try something she screams bloody murder. She\u2019s a year younger than my 7M and we have the 3 bite rule. If he truly doesn\u2019t like it then he can have cereal or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That has only ever happened once. He loves to try new things and he likes to eat fancy.", "No it doesn\u2019t. And don\u2019t pretend you are an expert about it.", "How much do you weigh?", "My grandmother had the exact same rule for my mom. Only took 25 years and multiple hospitalizations for her to finally get over the eating disorder it gave her. Hopefully that doesn\u2019t happen to you", "If a child thinks they can get out of eating something after one bite, they can hold their nose and force it down without ever giving it a chance. Or they won\u2019t actually stop to consider if what they\u2019re eating actually does taste good. \n\n3 bites forces them to consider it.", "That is just so ableist and stupid. I hate that mentality.", "Definitely!", "There's a difference between \"this is weird\" and \"I don't like this.\" Three bites makes sense for the former, but there are certain things that I definitely know I don't like in one bite. \n\nObviously you're a good mom. It's great that you want to do the right thing for your daughter after your mother failed to do the same for you. (100% with you on the cooked spinach. So gross.)\n\nMy bigger concern is about consent and the expectations that society puts on girls to be compliant. Now that she's heading into her teen years, rules that made sense for a younger child may not anymore. What message does it send that she only gets to decide what to eat after she's complied with someone else's demands about she should eat? How does she feel about the rule? Would she prefer a different approach to new foods? Could you find an approach that meets both of your concerns?", "You literally do though\u2026. Making her take another bite if she says she doesn\u2019t like it is \u201cmaking her do it again\u201d.", "You sound like a great parent. No need to worry about it.", "My mom never cook things we didn\u2019t like, but we learned to eat anything. And never made us stay sit in the table because of it. We had preferences and we could choose but it\u2019s totally rude not eating food that has been offered when you are a guest. That\u2019s etiquette.", "I agree, but to each their own, I guess.", "Well there I\u2019m in total agreement!", "Her kid doesn\u2019t have Arfid and a three bite rule would help not hurt.", "It really does. And FWIW given my experience with kids on the spectrum I am if not an expert at least a party with a good deal of experience treating disorders partially caused or exacerbated by forced feeding. \n\nI understand your resistance but it is real and the person you are speaking to clearly has issues regarding it so if you want to fight with someone on the subject I\u2019m thrilled to do so.", "I\u2019m literally someone who has food sensitivities lmao\u2026. But please do educate me.", "Why the hell does that matter", "I agree that forcing food can cause massive issues. I weight 130 and I\u2019m 6ft. Is that in anyway relevant?", "You don\u2019t need to know my weight. But if you must know, I\u2019m within the average/healthy weight for someone my height \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "I'm not sure it's a disorder, but I do force myself to eat foods I don't like when at someone else's house, like I did at the dinner in the post.", "Give me a *break.* I highly doubt it was the EXACT same rule. OP sounds quite considerate and open-minded. I think people like you just hate having to follow any rules and want to do whatever you please, so you make up shit like this to guilt trip them.", "She's always agreed with it because she's found foods she does really like, but needed a few bites to be sure, as what happened with her, and fish.  Spicy foods I never have her try more than one bite.  If she says it's too spicy after the first bite that's the end of it.  She has the same issue with spicy food that I do.  If I make something for the first, and she's sure she doesn't like it, I don't make it again, or I wait a few years to see if her tastes have changed which has also happened.", "I think we're going to see things differently here because we experience different things.  I respect your perspective, and I hope you respect mine.  You, and me, as well as my daighter are different people who react differently to things.  You have sensory issues which, while I have not experienced that myself, I do understand is a real problem.  One I acknowledge, and would not ignore if it was something my child experienced.  For someone who does not have sensory issues, typically the first bite it more of a this is \"weird\" type bite, and young children have been known to claim not to like something after a first bite simply to test boundaries.  I also know the difference between making my child eat 3 small bites of a food she's never had before, amd forcing her to clear a plate of food that I know she does not like as I lived that as a child.  I think it would be best for us both if we agree to disagree here, and wish each other a good evening/day as I don't know what time zone you're in.", "Unfortunately my mom's response to making things she knew we didn't like was that she liked them so we jist had to suck it up.  The only time we got a say on dinners was for our birthday if she was sober, and in a good mood.", "It\u2019s a cultural clash. There are some cultures that consider you clearing a plate of food as an insult as well.\n\nFor example in my parents home when I was a child I was told how people were starving and would do anything just for a taste of what I was refusing.\n\nThen again I took picky eating to an extreme and I was a child.  I grew out of my extreme food preferences in my teens when I became more curious about different foods from different parts of the world.", "I never said it would? However if the child is extremely resistant it is much better to defer to the child rather than force the 3 bites.", "3 bite rules do not help kids with ARFID!!", "If my daughter had texture sensitivity concerns I would adjust the rule because even though I've never experienced it myself, I know people who have.  I couldn't put her through that.", "3 bites is forced feeding?\n\nIf you can point me to one even credibly made up patient that has an eating disorder because they were forced to eat 3 bites of something, I\u2019ll give you an internet cookie.", "I'll educate you! You're projecting YOUR food issues onto a total stranger because your personal experience with it has biased you into oversensitivity. You should stop. It isn't healthy.\n\n:)\n\nEducated.\n\nBy the way, why did you say \"lmao\"? Are you actually laughing your ass off? You seem angry. What about that exchange was funny? Are you one of those people who pretends to be unbothered by showing how funny they want everyone else to think they find something? Be honest with the you within you!", "wasnt askin you", "No because I wasn't talking to you lol but thanks ig", "Since she's comfortable with it, I change my vote to NTA.", "I would like to point out I wasn\u2019t talking about just sensory issues, as that\u2019s what everyone seems to be hung up on. Other food issues can in fact develop, including eating disorders. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why you posted this honestly, because it seems you were prepared to go tooth and nail against anyone who may think you\u2019re wrong in this situation. \n\nIf you think you\u2019re right, then why post?", "So we\u2019re still talking about the child that ate 3 bites after getting a look from the mom, right?", "If my child has sensory or texture challenges, this would not be a rule for her.  I couldn't do that.  As she does not, the rule exists.", "Well that\u2019s a delightfully good answer. \n\nAnd yes it sucks I\u2019ve had ARFID my whole life and many of my clients are just now dealing with it and it\u2019s tough most people don\u2019t think the way you do and shut down any argument otherwise. \n\nThe biggest issue is social stigma and of course nutrition however the stigma is honestly harder to cope with. I have clients who won\u2019t eat at a table because of the abuse they suffered through absolutely no fault of their own. \n\nWhile I agree with you 3 bites rule I would love to see a disclaimer for spectrum kids because someone might think this is ok for everyone and honestly it probably isn\u2019t.", "Honestly I wish we could create an ASD simulation so I don\u2019t have to answer things like this. One meal with it on and you\u2019d get SO MUCH more compassion.", "And now I\u2019m asking you", "I was just responding to the girl who has forced feeding issues as she was correct and I felt it important she be validated on that. \n\nI don\u2019t believe this is forced feeding though. However she was correct that it absolutely causes horrific issues and 3 bites is fine exemplary even but only so long as the child buys in. If you are forcing your child to try 3 bites of a known hated food that can be literal torture for some kids.", "I was talking about other kids.", "I wish that people didn\u2019t pretend to be experts and give bad advice on the internet. \n\nBTW I\u2019m here for the parent who you are trying to convince is going to give her kid an eating disorder. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you hush.", "congratulations", "It was a food she had never had before.  If it was a food I knew she didn't like off the bat, I wouldn't have said anything if she didn't eat any of it.  If I know she doesn't like something I don't even ask her to try it.  If I can keep it off her plate I will.\n\nFor example, I know she doesn't like spicy foods so I never make her eat spicy foods.  She also doesn't like stuffing so it never goes on her plate.", "Crikey this is hardly  force feeding she didn\u2019t pin her down to eat the 3 bites and it was polite of daughter to try a few mouthfuls to appease the guest well the  husband even. \n\nGood deal with the food my Mum used to put a portion of the food I had to eat before leaving table there was a compromise.", "Thanks, I see you \ud83d\udc9a", "Literally nobody is talking about 3 bites of a known hated food. \n\nAlso nobody here has said they have eating issues.", "It\u2019s actually not bad advice. I\u2019m someone who literally has food issues, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. Please tell me your credentials that give you the power to tell me I\u2019m \u201cwrong\u201d. \n\nThe three bite thing actually can still cause issues, as to a child it definitely makes them feel pressured to eat and they don\u2019t understand the logic behind it. I could go even deeper than that, but this sub has proven to be hive mind trash once again. I\u2019m not here to argue. You can think what you want.", "Oh see that\u2019s great! You even eliminated an entire category of food to her preference and that\u2019s A+ \n\nI don\u2019t think three bites is bad so long as she doesn\u2019t have a gag reaction or heavy issues with sensory experience. \n\nI\u2019m just here because I sensed that someone who was forced and has some issues with it was getting some heat so I decided to deflect and defend.", "Well yeas actually I was just trying to support that girl. She did actually and I\u2019ve seen it before and she deserves to be validated and if means arguing on the internet with you then why not? I mean if you know what Arfid is then really you should already know. \n\nNo this situation isn\u2019t forced feeding but forced feeding can and does lead to extreme issues. \n\nHearing that might help her cope. One of the biggest issues for ASD adults is recovery from ARFID and the stigma of limited pallets. Validation I have found is the easiest way to get the ball rolling.", "If my child had any sensitivities I would absolutely change the rule on trying 3 bites to be sure before rejecting a food.  I couldn't do that to her if there was truly a discomfort issue.  I have had a few instances where my daughter didn't like something new on the first bite when it was simply because it was different.  By the third bite she loved, it, ate all of if, and went back for more.  If she truly doesn't like it after the third bite she didn't have to eat it.  She could eat the sides I knew she likes, and get seconds of those to make up for not eating the main dish.  I also do NOT keep making a dish she does not like.\n\nOk.  Let me change that last line a bit.  As tastes are constantly changing, I might make a dish she didn't like the first time a few years later, put only enough for 3 small bites on her plate to see if her tastes have changed.  If not, no problem, she still doesn't like it so I won't try again later.  If she does, great I'll start making it a bit more often.", "Btw, those 3 bites aren't big bites, but smaller, \"I'm testing this\" bites.", "I couldn't do that to her.  My mom did that crap, and it was horrible.  The worst was cooked spinach, and cow's tongue.  I can't stand either, and there is no way to make either in a way I like, but she would still make both, and force me to eat what she put on my plate.\n\nMy daughter hates spicy foods, sushi (so do I so that works for me), and stuffing so she gets served none of those.", "Eta that girl that got asked how much she weighed. I\u2019m here for her :)", "I think the thing you aren\u2019t getting from my point is, food issues can develop based on how the relationship with food is presented. Most food issues are not something you are born with. Some are, but lots can come later in life, depending on your relationship with food at different points. I think honestly I just don\u2019t agree with this method, because I\u2019m all too aware that just because it might seem like it\u2019s fine now, it may not be later. The judgements will probably land in your favor so you can just ignore me! But I do stand by how I feel about it.", "Does she ever change her mind after three bites?  I have a stubborn daughter who once she decided she didn\u2019t like it wouldn\u2019t change her mind."]}
