It's not that I don't like him or that I don't think they're a good match, but the ring is incredibly important to our family, and we hardly even know the guy. I don't want it to be lost or damaged.\n\nWhen I told him this, he got really upset and accused me of not trusting him with something that was so important to my family.

I think that may be where I'm getting hung up on this also?", "O.P. \u2014 How does BF know that she\u2019d be heartbroken if he didn\u2019t propose with the family ring? And... he has a ring picked out... for what exactly? It\u2019s not in HIS family... it\u2019s in HER family... seems broadly strange...", "NTA. This honestly doesn't make much sense to me. He has the ring picked out but wants to propose with HER family heirloom? It would sound fishy to me, too.", "INFO: \n\nWho originally owned the ring?\n\nIs there a tradition in your family for how it gets passed on?\n\nHow are you in possession of the ring?\n\nWere you given the right to control who gets it?\n\nIs it your plan to use the ring for your own future spouse?", "Info - I am confused. Your sister clearly told him about the ring and told him that you currently have possession of it. Which leads me to believe they have at least discussed the possibility of getting engaged. How is it that she hasn't mentioned to you that he might ask you for it? Or spoken to you about how you two will decide who will use it?", "NTA\n\nSeems like he is just guilt tripping you because he doesn't want to buy her a ring.", "INFO: I assume you're holding onto the ring. Are you the person who gets to decide who it gets passed down to, or is it supposed to be a group decision? Are your parents around, and if so, why don't they hold onto the ring? Why do you feel like he will lose or damage it? He clearly knows the importance of it. About how old is your sister and her bf, and did they know each other before they started dating?\n\nYou are understandably hesitant in not trusting a guy you don't know very well. I personally would not do what he did if I was only dating someone for one year and didn't know their family very well. Maybe have a conversation with your sister about marriage; don't tell her about your conversation with her boyfriend, but ask her questions. Maybe also explain to the boyfriend why you aren't ready to give him the ring and ask him to make more of an effort to get to know your family.\n\nEdit: I'm very confused as to why he would propose with the heirloom and not with the ring he bought her. A bit fishy. Is he into drugs, by any chance? Is the ring itself expensive, or more sentimental?", "INFO: is the heirloom going to be used for show during the proposal then he gives her the ring he bought? And does he really think your sister would be good with that or would she insist on keeping the heirloom?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know him well enough to trust him I wouldn\u2019t give it to him for any length of time besides immediately preceding the proposal. Just in case he bought a setting and intends to use the Diamond from the heirloom for it.", "INFO: Was this deliberately passed on to you for a reason? Do you want it for your marriage or your partners?", "NTA Why can't he propose without a ring?  Many people propose without one as brides often want to select the engagement ring themselves.   If your sister says that she wants to use the family heirloom as her engagement ring when he proposes, you can give it to her then.", "An engagement ring is a conditional gift FROM the man to his prospective bride.

I don't want it to be lost or damaged.\n\nBut it's going to be on your sister's finger. You know her, right? If you're worried about him keeping it in the interim, work out a system where you give it to him right before the proposal so it's only in his custody for a minimal period of time and your sister has it thereafter.\n\nINFO: I don't know if there's enough info here to say fully that YTA.

It sounds like you and your sister own this ring jointly, and you are in possession of it. Did you or your sister ever discuss how the ring would be passed on?\n\nObviously, if the boyfriend knows about it, your sister must have mentioned it to him. \n\nYou need to have a discussion with your sister, perhaps try to be vague and mention that you were doing some spring cleaning and came across it so as to not potentially ruin the surprise.", "INFO: who owns the ring?", "NTA. He's giving her a ring, so I actually don't understand why he wants the heirloom diamond ring that neither he nor your sister get to keep anyway.

You don't need a reason but if he wants to propose with an heirloom ring, he needs to shake one out of HIS family tree. The original purposes of a betrothal gift, which is what an engagement ring is,  were to symbolize the prospective bridegroom's willingness and ability to provide for his prospective bride and,  more practically,  to ensure that she *owns*, in her own right,  an item of value that can be sold or pawned to sustain her in the event of his death, disability or abandonment. \n\nOf course,  that is quite outdated now but it is pretty absurd to propose by presenting the bride with her own family's property .\n\nBeyond that,  I need to know why you are the current custodian of the ring before I can form any other opinions.", "NTA- See the way I thought these things went was, male side passes on family treasure to his new bride.. So if your a guy, then its your ring to give to your future spouse.  \n\nBF is being cheap, sorry he is. He was a nice diamond ring that he doesnt need to pay for so he can propose.    If your sister wanted the ring, you'd think she'd have mentioned it to you in some way over the time they'd been dating.", "YTA. unless i\u2019m doing the math wrong, the ring belongs in your family, with your sister. after her boyfriend proposes, it will be in the care of\u2026 your sister. if the engagement breaks off, it will return to the care of\u2026 your sister. right? and the heirloom belongs to her just as much as you? if you\u2019re really worried about the boyfriend damaging it, why not hold onto it until the day of the proposal and hand it over to him just for the five minutes it\u2019ll take to propose and put it on her finger? \n\nunless *you* want it for your future fianc\u00e9e, in which case, just say that.", "NTA - An engagement ring is a gift from the asker to the asked. In no way is this ring the boyfriend's. So it can't be used as an engagement ring from him to her.", "Nta. The origin of giving a ring was making a commitment to the person receiving a proposal. It is saying 'I've spent a lot of money on this token for you to prove I'm serious. If you accept it you are saying you are serious about me too'\n\nThe message bf is sending is the reverse of that. The guy is a bum and  you are doing your sister a favour.", "NTA but I think you can figure out a middle ground. For example, a contract for starters. Then you can ask if the proposal can be somewhere you can meet up with him right before to give it, and then you can hold back to take photos/videos while it goes down since you might as well make yourself useful\n\nTo be fair, if you proposed with it and then got divorced the ring would leave your family too I think (unless there are different laws around heirloom rings)", "NTA. You have a valid concern about the family heirloom, and it's understandable that you want to protect it. It's not necessarily about not trusting your sister's boyfriend; it's about preserving a valuable and sentimental item that has been passed down through generations.\n\nYou could try to explain your concerns to both your sister and her boyfriend and let them know that it's not a personal slight against him. Suggest alternative options for an engagement ring, and if possible, find a way to incorporate the family heirloom into their lives in a different manner, such as wearing it on special occasions or having it as a keepsake.\n\nUltimately, the decision about the heirloom should be made by your family, taking into consideration everyone's feelings and the importance of preserving the ring's legacy.", "I'm gonna buck the trend and say YTA. \n\nYour sister obviously wants it and you are \"not opposed\" to using it in the future, not a ringing endorsement that it will ever be used. \n\nOther than him stealing it, moving away, and changing his name so you can never find him, the worst case is they get engaged, they break it off, and she still has the ring and could give it to you to use. Engagement rings legally belong to the person who provided it if there is a broken engagement. \n\nI'd bet you that your sis has been dreaming of this ring forever.  That's the ring she wants.

By judging the way the sister's bf is acting towards you I feel like his intention is to sell it to a pawn shop owner.", "So let me see if I got this straight.  Your family has a heirloom ring of unknown origins that typically has been passed down to the oldest in the family.  You are now caretaker of that ring since your parents passed (please allow me to say I\u2019m very sorry for your loss ) You also are the older twin which seems like you would be the rightful \u201cheir\u201d to such ring.
