We have 4 kids that I have been solely responsible for their entire lives. He is military so I have been mostly a stay at home parent, but have always had an income. We have always worried about money bc he lives above our means. I was initially against credit cards &wanted to use cash &budget bc I grew up poor with food & housing insecurity &have been on my own since I was 15. He comes from a well off family, &has a safety net. We made over 150k combined last year, but can live on his salary alone. \n\nIn 2021 we sold our house &received 50k, he put 40k  in crypto w/o consulting me instead of paying off cc debt, we lost all of it. He made me an authorized user on every card w/o consulting me, now I have terrible credit. The bulk of this has happened over the last 3 years, but he has always been financially irresponsible just NEVER to this extent. I stopped using our cc in Jan 22\u2019 when I realized we had spent over 25k in one month. I am now in school for a high paying career bc I finally accept that we are not safe having to solely rely on him. He wants me to work FT making barely 15/hr, take care of 4 kids alone, bc now his clearance is in danger. He hasn\u2019t asked me to quit school but I would have no other option. I have sold important things to feed my kids bc he has left us with no money while he gets 3 meals a day. I doordash some nights to buy food. I am even taking out loans though my education is paid for. \n\nMy last straw was after being away for 3wks he spent the last money to gamble so he could \u201cmake more\u201d he lost it & had to leave 2 days later leaving me with no money to feed our 4 kids. I have taken into consideration he may be depressed, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his choices. I am honestly so embarrassed, there are a lot of things I was not taught & had to figure out on my own, but now that I know better I am appalled. I didn\u2019t stash money under the guise of being a good wife &not \u201cstealing from him\u201d. I have suggested we sell our house to pay off debt, he refused. \n\nI am exhausted trying to keep us afloat &it\u2019s all in vain. He is upset I won\u2019t work but all my money would go to gas and childcare. He has only contributed to our family financially &now he can\u2019t do that w/o my help. He spends his free time playing games &watching YouTube. Any time he spends with us is bc I initiated it &his excuse is always bc \u201che\u2019s tired\u201d or \u201che\u2019s stressed bc money\u201d. I feel I have been patient &encouraging but that\u2019s gotten me nowhere. As crazy as it sounds I do feel like an AH for not wanting to help to pay down more than my portion of the debt. He will always be ok, he has parents that will help him they have before. I am completely on my own in this world, I have no safety net and no one I can call for help and I realize he has taken advantage of my kindness and empathy over the years.", "created_utc": 1682877372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133ygmh/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_spouse_pay_off/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I refuse to leave and end up in a shelter with them. \n\nWe are not in danger and he is not abusive, just financially irresponsible and can be manipulative but I have learned how to detect that and not fall into the trap.

It gives me the time I need to make the smartest and most informed decision that benefits our children and doesn\u2019t leave him in complete financial ruin.

I was NOT a minor, and although looking back now I realize the huge age gap and what exactly that means, we were both legal adults. I have also been on my own since 15 as I stated above. I actually had no parental guidance from the age of 13 so I was a prime target for predators.", "This is an interesting comment. He actually used to be until I set boundaries when I was 23. I guess you could argue he still is that it just looks different now. He\u2019s no longer withholding funds or access, just using it all and accruing debt so that we have nothing extra.", "This exactly. NTA", "His parents are aware but it\u2019s always somehow my fault since I \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d, they are abusive. They also have recently disowned their grandchildren for having minds of their own. Believe it or not one of his parents is a financial advisor. I know my only way out is my education and somehow have managed to maintain a 3.5 gpa despite all the stress. Unfortunately the military is no help, they do not care about the families of their service members.\n\nI do not agree with going after his career because that has a negative impact on our children, but my hopes for salvaging the marriage faded years ago. I knew it was inevitable it would end, just wasn\u2019t sure when or how. Each incident makes me feel dumb because why wasn\u2019t that the last straw? I am fully aware now though so that is more than I can say for my past, I just need to know I wasn\u2019t being an AH.", "I guess it\u2019s been hard for me to label him an addict but the patterns are there so maybe I was just in denial. I do know he doesn\u2019t care though, that is very clear to me.", "He has an addictive personality, meaning he can become addicted to anything. His addictions have changed over the years but they\u2019re always expensive and they\u2019re always a money pit. I believe he has undiagnosed ADHD he\u2019s always looking for a hit of dopamine.", "Unfortunately I was duped into using all of them to buy groceries and things for the kids. I wish I could say I never touched them, but I can\u2019t because I trusted him. I will research what options I have though.", "This is more how I feel because accepting that he\u2019s doing this intentionally would be too much for me but honestly he sees the effects. He sees that we can\u2019t feed our children without me finding a way and that in itself is enough for me. I have enabled him, I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what I was doing but it was. Above I said he\u2019s always had an addictive personality he obsesses over things spends a bunch of money on them then finds something else once that wears off. It\u2019s a cycle I tried to make a joke of but it\u2019s a cycle nonetheless.", "I still have 2 years and it feels like forever after being here for 13, but the time will pass anyway and one of those years he will be gone not spending money so that\u2019s honestly what keeps me going. We ordered out a lot spending roughly $300/day on food during quarantine and he ordered a lot of unnecessary stuff off of Amazon. It wasn\u2019t all him, I never want to make it seem that way, but majority was him and if he never opened the card the debt wouldn\u2019t have accumulated. I can\u2019t open cards or get loans and haven\u2019t been able to for the last 13 years other than one card for a few hundred.", "Omg thank you for saying that. I don\u2019t think anyone has ever said that to me besides my kids \u2764\ufe0f", "People always advise this, but realistically how am I going to support my kids with no education and a minimum wage salary? I have NOBODY but me. I don\u2019t have parents, my siblings are barely making it themselves and have kids of their own. I have no true friends as I have come to realize while going through this. I don\u2019t ask for handouts and I don\u2019t ask people for money. I work my ass off so that I don\u2019t have to but even my \u201cfriends\u201d who could help with a job didn\u2019t and they knew I was struggling to feed my kids. \n\nSo after years of having the illusion of support I am once again reminded that I only have me to rely on and nobody is going to look out for me or my kids. If we were being abused that would be completely different and their quality of life wouldn\u2019t matter as much as them being alive. But we are safe and it would be wildly irresponsible of me to rip them from their lives with no way of providing them a roof over their heads and food in their bellies at the absolute bare minimum.", "Nothing and I only realized that this year. It was only ever a paycheck and now he can\u2019t even do that so there\u2019s truly no point in remaining married. Of course it hasn\u2019t all been bad, but the bad things are huge and detrimental for everyone.", "His parents do not care about me or our kids. They know we struggle and loan him 1k here and there between paychecks but my eyes were opened when they gave him 20k for a car engine he just had to have when we were drowning in credit card debt and a $700+ car payment for that same car he just had to have. Ended up having to sell it a year later. Because he is gone so much now I am in complete control of our finances and he has no access to them while he\u2019s away.", "Thank you for this. I knew about fleet and family we used them for marriage counseling years ago. I was under the impression financial services was for the service member only so I will definitely look into this. I am and have been in counseling for many years as well as our kids. I only worry about his clearance because retirement is so close and I don\u2019t want it to negatively impact our kids with their financial support from him. It may sound crazy but I want him to have every opportunity to go up in rank so our kids get more come retirement. I could care less about what I receive as far as alimony or retirement but I don\u2019t want to fuck it up for the kids out of spite or making a decision based on emotions. We are not in any physical danger as I\u2019ve stated several times so I\u2019m not in a rush, especially since he is leaving. He is still a person whether shitty or not and still my kids father so I\u2019d like to minimize the fall out as much as possible.

My goal is also not to ruin him or take everything from him. We also don\u2019t even owe nearly enough to file for bankruptcy. Our bills are paid and up to date, we just have no extra. Now if our mortgage was behind etc. then yes I would consider but we are ok because of all the sacrifices I have had to make recently. I was naive to trust him blindly, but I am no dummy. He receives bonuses and large lump sums a few times a year that I have access to before he does since he is gone so I always pay down his credit cards with those. The only reason we are not completely in financial ruin is because of my actions.", "He\u2019s not that desperate, his family has always come to his rescue. He\u2019s also almost retired and has no secrets to tell because his job isn\u2019t dealing in anything of importance to national security.", "I take out student loans so we can eat so I don\u2019t have to doordash because of an incident when I was doing doordash at night while he was gone and I could\u2019ve potentially not come home to our kids. That really put things in perspective for me. I have 2 more years of school, no real way to expedite that but while he\u2019s gone I will absolutely make sure to put money aside he doesn\u2019t know about because if he knows about it something that we \u201cneed\u201d always comes up.", "I know this now, but I think I\u2019ve convinced myself I\u2019ll only be able to do that if I\u2019m making a certain amount because I don\u2019t want us to struggle once we\u2019re gone. I never want to be dependent on him or anyone else again so I have to make sure I can financially provide the baseline.", "This is exactly what it feels like and I\u2019ve expressed my concern to him several times in the last few months. There truly is no excuse. Our household bills are paid by his income, but I do understand what you\u2019re saying.", "Yea I\u2019m no longer trying to help him. I learned that a few years ago.", "According to others here I can so I\u2019m going to look into doing that, and thank you.", "Your last statement hits me hard because it does feel like I\u2019m just waiting for the next thing to happen. Luckily with his upcoming deployment It gives me the space to breathe and make a rational plan since he won\u2019t be here and won\u2019t have access to any of our money. I mean, I do have a plan I am just waiting to graduate. Thank you for pointing that part about me being the only one because it\u2019s hard not to make excuses for him.

It is an us problem because it impacts my kids, maybe most people don\u2019t see it that way and that\u2019s fine but the man is close to retirement and I\u2019m not gonna fuck that up for him and and essentially myself. Once I\u2019m done with school his security clearance is not my concern but until then I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen because my kids and I will be negatively impacted. Once I\u2019m no longer in the relationship and can take care of our kids without his money then that\u2019s on him.", "Thank you for this, I think because I make sure me and the kids can eat and we aren\u2019t starving it causes me to look at it more as \u201cwe\u2019re just in a rough patch and this is stressful\u201d as opposed to \u201che put us in this rough patch\u201d. He\u2019s going to neglect the kids whether we\u2019re together or not, it\u2019s not something I \u201callow\u201d that\u2019s his choice. Even if we have joint custody he would neglect them during his time that\u2019s not something I have control over as much as it hurts me to say.

If I understand correctly, active service members and their families can get free in person counseling.\n\nIf nothing else, I\u2019d recommend signing up for yourself if you can.

Rooting for you, OP.", "Do they actually know about your financial position. Assume most of what they know is from him which I suspect is wildly different from the truth.

I was an E-7 and after taxes and sbd I make 2100 so not really life changing money that's for sure. As for the clearance, those things just don't disappear by any means unless you do some illegal stuff. Financial issues happen to most people and the clearance people deal with those probably more than you think. I used to tell my sailors \"the situation is unique to you because you're going through it, it isn't unique to me because I have hundreds of sailors I've dealth with this exact same issue with\" and the financial counselors, clearance people, family counselors etc...have seen some crazy stuff over the years. Continue your path, finish school and don't remove yourself from any cards or anything like that until you speak with the financial counselor as it could negatively impact your credit as well. If you haven't already, I would personally recommend a separate account for the time being, navy fed is great because you can see all your accounts on the app and if needed you can transfer to an account he doesn't have access to quickly.

Our kids are also in therapy because he neglects to foster a relationship with them and I refuse to have them struggle unnecessarily like I had to. I am pretty proactive with them because of how I was raised. \n\nHe is against individual therapy for him and doesn\u2019t think he needs it and also says he doesn\u2019t have the time. That was a nonnegotiable for me once I was privy to the ways in which I was abused by him and his family over the years. It has now been 3 years since I gave them the ultimatum to go and he has not. We went to couples therapy through the military for several years but it never worked because he needed individual therapy. He never felt like he was in the wrong and I realized it was pointless and decided to focus on myself and individual therapy. I will be holding up my end of the ultimatum once I graduate.", "I do not currently work. I have worked over the years and always had an income for the most part. I am in school full time so I take out student loans and I doordash to buy dinner and for gas money some nights but I do not currently work anywhere that gives me a check and when I was he never took my money it just always got spent because both of our checks were deposited into a joint account even though we\u2019ve always had separate and joint I just didn\u2019t keep much of any for myself. Stupid looking back now but it is what was done.\n\n I am also against uprooting our kids lives and having them struggle given my upbringing as I stated in another reply. It\u2019s irresponsible and we are not in any physical danger so it\u2019s unnecessary to put them through struggle for the sake of leaving sooner.

I do see the effects and I refuse to live like this any longer than I have to. Luckily we\u2019re not on the verge of being on the streets but we are one emergency away and that\u2019s close enough for me. My saving grace is his pending deployment.", "I\u2019m not against receiving either, I just don\u2019t want to have to rely on it if that makes sense. Because I\u2019m not in physical danger I have an opportunity to set me and the kids up nicely so that anything I get from him will be extra and can be put into a separate account for them.", "They know because I have told them. I am to blame for being a sahm because I\u2019m perfectly capable of working. He talks to them about all the cards he\u2019s opened, every line of credit, every wild get rich quick scheme he has and his mom is a financial advisor who calls him stupid and then loans him money. They enable him.", "Thank you for all of this.", "Filing bankruptcy can cause him to lose his security clearance, in turn cause him to lose his job so it absolutely will affect his career, I checked. Although there is no minimum amount we are less than 30k in credit card debt so I don\u2019t think bankruptcy is the answer seeing as how I will need to be able to be approved to rent a place on my own after filing and a bankruptcy will tank my already low credit score so I\u2019d like to avoid it at all costs. I never said we have a card we won\u2019t be able to pay off. The credit cards can be paid off with his bonuses he has just chosen not to do so most recently. Again, he brings in more than enough for us to pay these things off if he lived within our means. I have an opportunity in a few months to use his bonus to pay off 2 cards and significantly pay down a few others since he will be away. Again, I am not trying to ruin him despite everything I\u2019ve dealt with over the years because if he can not care for himself how can he care for our kids when he has them?", "It will only because I\u2019ll only be able to bring in about $20k per year on my own before finishing school. Once I finish school I\u2019ll have the potential to be making just as much if not more than him so their quality of life will not be impacted at all once we go. That is my goal. I can not do to my children what was done to me. It would be wildly irresponsible of me to uproot their lives when I can\u2019t afford to put a roof over their heads and food in their bellies at the bare minimum. \n\nYour comment is spot on though because once i started seeing my personal debt compared to his and how much I needed for the bare minimum basic necessities it was much more manageable for me and felt attainable. Keeping the motivation and not falling for his promises is going to be the hard part because I want more than anything for our kids to have their father in the same house but not at the expense of my happiness or health.", "Get your schooling finished ASAP. You will need this for you & your children's future.\n\nThat has to be a prime goal for the short term. If you are on the CCs, you can cancel some (you still have to pay off the balance).

I believe they do but only for the service members. I will have to check if it\u2019s offered to the spouses as well.", "FYI, authorized users can't close accounts, just remove themselves from the accounts. I still advise removing yourself from all CC accounts you're unwilling to make payments on, as any CC account your name is on will affect your credit score.", "He does make me question, he\u2019s very good at manipulating my emotions because I am empathetic and can see his side.

It's worth a few calls, certainly. \n\nThere is also a recent movement in the military to be aware of abuse. The financial shenanigans of your husband, resulting in food insecurity for 5 family members, certainly would count to my thinking. But, that could blow-back on his career & I don't know how nuclear you want to approach things.\n\nHugs to you.\n\nYou ever want a coffee date north of Boston, reach out :)", "Oooooh. Do you feel that he is also gaslighting you? The reason I ask is because you are posting here. Do you have any people you can trust to calibrate you, so to speak?

Also to add OP, keep questioning)", "Yea I\u2019m pretty well versed with the programs offered through the military, unfortunately I am not able to take advantage of them because it does expose him and would negatively impact his career which I am against. Regardless of the husband he is, he has sacrificed a lot for his career and I would never take that from him. It takes away from our kids in the long run as well. In our first year of marriage I went to them for help and legal made it very clear I was on my own and they would do everything in their power to back him. They are for the service member, not their family. I have seen many spouses get fucked over in 13 years. It\u2019s very sad because this type of abuse isn\u2019t as cut and dry as his knocking my teeth out. Much harder to prove. And thank you for the offer if I\u2019m ever in town I\u2019ll take you up on that.", "Yes I absolutely do, I also feel like I gaslight myself which is why I asked here. I don\u2019t have friends or family, not because he isolated me, my family is terrible and I\u2019ve been on my own since I was 15 and I didn\u2019t know how to choose good friends as I have recently found out while going through this situation.", "Why not reach out to his family if you and your kids are going hungry? Definitely stash money too, work on your education and toward divorce as well. But perhaps in the short term they might help you out and perhaps put pressure on him to not be so negligent of his family.

They know, they do not care. They have given him 20k for a racing engine for his brand new car while they knew we were struggling and in debt. They think me being a sahm is the reason we don\u2019t have money. They also question the paternity of our kids for no other reason then they came from me the woman who is not their biological child and \u201cthere\u2019s always a question\u201d even though they gave my children a paternity test behind my back. They disowned our children recently because their biological daughter had a child. I haven\u2019t spoken to them in several years.", "Exactly why I haven\u2019t gone to his command. He is in charge of many people this would absolutely impact him negatively. I have no desire to destroy what he\u2019s accomplished at work, his inability to take care of home actually has no impact on his job, he\u2019s a great leader at work. I\u2019ve been jealous over the years because I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s more than capable of compassion and empathy at work, just not with his family. Ruining his career benefits no one it actually hurts everyone involved and if he was a civilian it wouldn\u2019t matter at all."]}
