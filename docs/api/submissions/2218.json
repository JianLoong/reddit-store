Shame on MIL for dragging guests into her domestic problem. She should've compromised and had you stay in a hotel in the first place. The resulting experience was poor for you and for her husband.

Explain that her partner's discomfort wirh sharing - the way he obviously didn't feel able to traverse his own home while you were there, his statement that he'd rather take a vacation next time than spend it with you - is hard to ignore.

His behavior is a red flag because of the way he's isolating her from her loved ones/support group, as well as the way she feels responsible for his emotional regulation. Sometimes that's just a personality quirk, but it's very frequently a sign that a relationship is unhealthy and perhaps even abusive. Codependency in older adults is something we tend to overlook. But I work in family law, and I used to do a lot of elder care and probate work. The way codependent adult relationships can devolve into outright abuse as the parties age is something we've all got to learn to be more mindful of.
