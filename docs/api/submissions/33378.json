Our kids together are 22, 20, and 18. Ex MIL and exH have a strained relationship, because if this, and rarely talk, so ex MIL reached out to me as neither exH or the kids seemed interested in talking to her.\n\nEx MIL asked me why none of her grandkids bother to see her for Christmas or any holidays/birthdays for that matter. She said she loves the kids and misses them terribly but feels lonely and wants to spend time with them. That she can't understand what she did to make them treat her this way.\n\nI tried to gently explain to ex MIL that the kids felt rather neglected by her. Ex MIL lives 2 states away and since the oldest has been born, she's only traveled here once to see the kids. Every other time it was my ex and I when we were together or just my ex and the kids after we split up. Unless the kids were there in person for holidays or birthdays they never got gifts from her. Ex MIL also never calls just to say she misses them or loves them to the kids,  nor does she call oh holidays or birthdays. The few times a year she does call its a guilt trip with a side of pity party, the conversation is only about her. (Ex MIL is decently well off and she can drive so it's not impossible for her to make the trip, I'd be understanding if that was the case.)\n\nThe kids are all young adults now, so not really kids anymore, and they see how little their grandma puts into seeing them and being part of their lives. They've all taken the attitude of, we'll go see grandma when grandma comes to see us. My ex and I both agree it's their choice and they are old enough to make that choice. The last time they traveled to see ex MIL was 6 years ago to attend a funeral, there's been no visits since then\n\nI relayed all of that to ex MIL, telling her that effort begets effort and other than her choosing not to be more involved she had always been welcome. Ex MIL started crying, saying that those are her grandchildren and she deserves to be in their lives but she feels like they all hate her.\n\nI responded with, they don't hate you yet, but you're the only one who can fix that, and hung up the phone.

Truth hurts sometimes but needs to be said.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA.  She created the situation for herself by her own inaction.  Sad the truth hurts but it is the truth.", "> she deserves to be in their lives \n\nYes, she does. Therefore, she should be in their lives. Unfortunately, this requires a minimum of effort, whereas she thinks \"being in their lives\" is something passive. NTA.", "NTA if she wants to fix the relationship she has with them then she needed to hear the truth.", "NTA.\n\nYou just described my children's relationship with my mother.", "NTA   my sons paternal g/parents and aunts were never that interested. When we separated it became screamingly obvious the couldn't give a shit.   I moved OS for a year or so to be with my family. Child was 2.    Ex had no problem with this as he was just as pathetic .  In the year child never got a card or present  for 2 Christmas and a birthday.   One of the aunts was visiting a year later and through ex I heard that she would like to come and take my child for the day but didn't think I would let her.   Damn bloody right I didn't. He had no clue who she was.  I didn't even let her come to see us.", "NTA\n\nMy MIL is like your exMIL.  Never had any interest in any of my kids... and now wonders why none of them go and visit her..\n\nWhy would they... she wasn't interested in them as kids.. why would they be interested in her as an old lady who actually hurt them by her disinterest (let's just say that there are other grandkids that she did spend a lot of time with).\n\nI don't know why she was like that.  Probably because they are my children... rather than looking at it as her son's children.  Ironically my husband is the one who drops everything to help her while living several hours drive from where she lives while the other kids who live 10 mins and 30 mins from her... seem to drop off the radar when it comes to helping her.", "NTA", "NTA. Nobody is owed love. Love is a gift. Some people are luckier than they deserve and are loved despite putting little or no effort in. But that doesn\u2019t mean love is *owed* based purely on relationship.", "You're NTA. You answered honestly. She is getting back exactly what she put into the relationships. It's sad, but she is at fault here. \n\nWe lost my grandma 6 and a half years ago, she was in her 90's. We were constantly visiting, taking her out- to the mall, movies, restaurants, and her favorite- drives on the beach. She would always say *why are you all so good to me?* and I would say, *granny, you're reaping what you have sown.*\n\nShe did everything for everyone and earned the loving devotion she received. Your ex MIL sounds like she could have taken some lessons from my grandma.", "I did end it abruptly but I also know the guilt trip antics too well to stay on the phone long enough for those to really start.", "NTA.  She wants them to care about her and spend time with her but she has never done anything to nurture a relationship with them. A good family relationship takes work and she didn't want to do it. NOW she thinks the kids should jump to see her because she has time and is lonely. Sucks to be her...it is a bit of a FA and FO situation!", "NTA. Truth hurts. Her lack of effort has come home to her.", "NTA. Sounds like MIL is a very selfish person who manipulates people into meeting her needs. You can't win with those people. Indifference and civility is the best way to keep yourself insulated and maintain some self respect.  \n\nYou only doubt yourself because she makes it clear she resents people that don't fulfill her misplaced sense of entitlement.\n\nCreating human beings doesn't entitle you to unconditional love from them and their heirs for life. Bearing children is not an MLM.", "NTA OP, I was your children. My grandma moved to the States for work way before I was born, then lived in my country for a short time after I was born only to go back when I was around 4. My dad (and tbh all his siblings too) has abandonment issues because of her, and it has colored my relationship with both of them and all of my dad's family. I'd talk to her maybe twice a year, and now  that she's moved back after retiring, she never misses an opportunity to tell me how absent a daughter/granddaughter I am.\n\nMy mom never made us seek her out because she saw how little effort she put in, and let me tell you, my relationship with my mom is much better for it. You were kind in how you explained the situation, and if she's hurt it's only because it's true, and the truth stings.", "NTA.  Treat others how you want to be treated.", "Good for you! XMIL 'deserves' to be in their lives. Nope. No one deserves that if it's only in their interest. The kids don't know her, why should they invest time and love in a relationship with her. She sounds like a cold fish. One that smells bad. NTA", "NTA. When she says she deserves to be in their lives, she sounds like what she really means is that she deserves for them to do all the work to include her in their lives. She could easily do that work herself but she thinks it's the responsibility of others. \n\nThat kind of attitude is sometimes present in elder family members as if their age means other people are responsible for all the effort and emotional labor and that they are simply due that because they're the \"grand\" or older whatever.", "What she technically said, \"I deserve to be in their lives as their grandma, and they should put all the effort in making it happen.\" NTA. You are right. She needs to do something herself to have a relationship with her grandkids and not expect them to do all the work.", "Yep my dad rarely sees his grandkids or calls. He doesn\u2019t even know how to spell my daughter\u2019s name correctly lol. He told my niece at my daughter\u2019s bday party something about not seeing her in a long time. And she just responded \u201cwe all make choices in life\u201d. He only loves an hour and a half away but also house sits a lot in my city. So understandable your kids don\u2019t make an effort.", "And it's not like the effort needs to look the same for everyone. My mother's parents lived in another country and visited only once; it was always us who flew to them otherwise. But that country was and still is quite poor, they simply did not have the means to pay for visits whereas we did. And when we were there, love and support was just oozing out of my grandparents, they were really caring and hands-on. (No internet yet or such so otherwise it was phone calls here and there.)\n\nSo yeah, I always felt close to my mother's parents and I knew they loved me dearly. They showed their love in any way they were able.   \n\n\nThere are many ways to show you care. Granny here chose to apply exactly none of them. But demands that people show caring to her...", "Most of my family doesn't understand this. My niece and nephew run to me at family gatherings because I'm the only one to drive all the way up to visit them once a month.", "If you didn't also include her guilt trip antics on the list of reasons why your kids are uninterested, then you were being exceptionally kind.\n\nEither way, NTA."]}
