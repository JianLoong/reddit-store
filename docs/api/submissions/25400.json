We have been friends for about two years now and she is getting married to one of my other friends in Sept 2024. She had asked me to be a bridesmaid in the wedding and I said absolutely I will be. Some personal reasons (financially) came up with me and I had told her about and she asked me if I could still afford the wedding. I said yes it wasn\u2019t a problem being as I would be more financially stable by the time January rolled around when all the stuff for the wedding would be bought. On July 31 she had sent me a text message that sounded like a robot. It didn\u2019t even sound like her. Text message reads: \u201c\u201dHi Christine, Dave and I have been communicating with family. We're switching the wedding party around and unfortunately we are removing one person. We made the decision based off of the length of the friendship and ours is the shortest. I'm very sorry, but we are no longer including you in the wedding party. But you are still invited as a guest and hope our friendship stays the same I love you very much.\u201d\u201d I said \u201cno problem\u201d and then she proceeded to apologize and stated she still wanted to remain close friends. I had no problem with that. August 4th rolls around and we are both at the same truck show (Carlisle Truck Nationals) for the weekend. I proceed to walk over to her, her fianc\u00e9 and the rest of our friend group under the tent. She wanted nothing to do with me. I said hello and she brushed me off. I thought nothing of it because it was hot that day and we were all tired. Next day comes around I walk over say hello to everyone and she brushes me off again. At this point I was like \u201cok what did I do\u201d I waited until after we all went home mind you I live in PA and they all live in Jersey 2.5 hours away. A couple days after the show she had messaged me basically stating she purposely ignored me all weekend because her fianc\u00e9 had told her I was mad at her. For what reason I do not know but I was not mad at her at all. Last night I was talking with a mutual friend of ours and his wife explaining the situation and he had told me that I had left the bridal party for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d which wasn\u2019t true. I got kicked out of the bridal party because I supposedly sent a titty picture to another mutual friend who is married. That never happened either. I don\u2019t go sending out random titty pictures to married man nor to mutual friends. Needless to say she still wants her glass back but she is not getting it and I am not responding to her RSVP for the wedding since I will not be attending to make myself look like a fool. So am I the asshole for not giving her the bridesmaid cup back and unfriending her and all the other mutual friends we have on social media?", "created_utc": 1692878455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zzyoq/aita_for_refusing_to_send_back_my_bridesmaid_gift/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
