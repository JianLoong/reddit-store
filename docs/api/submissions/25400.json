We have been friends for about two years now and she is getting married to one of my other friends in Sept 2024. She had asked me to be a bridesmaid in the wedding and I said absolutely I will be. Some personal reasons (financially) came up with me and I had told her about and she asked me if I could still afford the wedding. I said yes it wasn\u2019t a problem being as I would be more financially stable by the time January rolled around when all the stuff for the wedding would be bought. On July 31 she had sent me a text message that sounded like a robot. It didn\u2019t even sound like her. Text message reads: \u201c\u201dHi Christine, Dave and I have been communicating with family. We're switching the wedding party around and unfortunately we are removing one person. We made the decision based off of the length of the friendship and ours is the shortest. I'm very sorry, but we are no longer including you in the wedding party. But you are still invited as a guest and hope our friendship stays the same I love you very much.\u201d\u201d I said \u201cno problem\u201d and then she proceeded to apologize and stated she still wanted to remain close friends. I had no problem with that. August 4th rolls around and we are both at the same truck show (Carlisle Truck Nationals) for the weekend. I proceed to walk over to her, her fianc\u00e9 and the rest of our friend group under the tent. She wanted nothing to do with me. I said hello and she brushed me off. I thought nothing of it because it was hot that day and we were all tired. Next day comes around I walk over say hello to everyone and she brushes me off again. At this point I was like \u201cok what did I do\u201d I waited until after we all went home mind you I live in PA and they all live in Jersey 2.5 hours away. A couple days after the show she had messaged me basically stating she purposely ignored me all weekend because her fianc\u00e9 had told her I was mad at her. For what reason I do not know but I was not mad at her at all. Last night I was talking with a mutual friend of ours and his wife explaining the situation and he had told me that I had left the bridal party for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d which wasn\u2019t true. I got kicked out of the bridal party because I supposedly sent a titty picture to another mutual friend who is married. That never happened either. I don\u2019t go sending out random titty pictures to married man nor to mutual friends. Needless to say she still wants her glass back but she is not getting it and I am not responding to her RSVP for the wedding since I will not be attending to make myself look like a fool.

They are slandering you, and I would not just leave with a hanging head. People need to know what really happened and what shitty \"friends\" they are.", "Any chance you can post the message you got from her about kicking you out of the bridal party and tagging all your mutual friends?", "Dang it lol.", "That\u2019s petty though.", "It can also be used as a way of serving notice of a legal herring.", "Have an angry upvote.", "NTA. It was a gift, they dropped you after sending it, who cares if they want it back.\n\nIf you want to find out the truth or care about some of these other friends then I'd go full group text to everyone, list the lies you've been informed have been spread about you and you want everyone to say exactly who they heard it from and when. You want the person who stated you sent a titty pic to a married guy to identify the guy so they could prove if that rumour is true or not. Someone int hat group is clearly lying about you and you want to get to the bottom of it.\n\nIf you don't get block them and don't look back.\n\nIt's kind of got that smell of jealous bride, like maybe one night while drunk she asks the husband if she's hotter than all her friends and he's dumb/drunk enough to say you're hotter than her and she decides to sabotage the hell out of you with everyone.", "NTA. \n\nI would not give it back, but I wouldn't keep the cup either. I would get rid of it. Don't need it as a reminder of what went down.", "NTA, it's a gift you can't ask for it back. I would put her on blast for her behavior and lies she's told.", "If you have not told her that you will not give it back, respond that you donated to a thrift store when you were kicked out of the wedding party.", "Okay, so it wasn\u2019t just me then.  I was like WHAT GLASS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT", "I support this.", "Welllll given that you have nudes on your onlyfans, I can see how it's plausible you may have sent a titty pic to this friend unknowingly lol", "Do you still have the text she sent you?  Send to everyone invited to the wedding you know.", "If I were being generous, I might infer a connection to the bridesmaid gift mentioned *in the post TITLE*, but the body of a post needs to be a self-contained work if it's to make **any** sense.\n\nHow the hell would *a glass* be a bridesmaid gift, anyway? Much less one worth asking for back.", "Too far dude, too far.", "No COD is cash on delivery.", "It was my understanding that Scottish and English personally delivered the fish, generally via using it to slap the intended recipient upside the head. Being small island nations this made the most sense.\n\nIt was only in the Americas, North America in particular, that \u201cMailing COD\u201d became common. It was a concession to large overland distances and a lack of ready access to the ocean across the continent.", "It's ok to admit you didn't get the joke...", "Thank you, I am not a historian by training and haven't gone to the primary sources.", "Stop changing the subject. I want to know more about the fish.", "I mean, that's always a possibility.  It just didn't read like a joke \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well, the fish was called Wanda", "Screw her, she's not your friend.  Block her number and quick.  NTAH.", "She kicked you out of the wedding party and spreading false rumors about you, yeah SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT getting that gift anymore now", "A gift is a gift.", "NTA 100%", "Include a burned black candle in the box with the broken cup. Just for fun. \n\nNTA", "This person is FILLED WITH DRAMA \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThat took a hard left turn!  Suddenly there's nudes involved?!\n\nYou're better off without this drama honestly.", "Don\u2019t just break it. Shatter it. Lots of nice and tiny shards that can\u2019t be glued back together. Then mail it in a package marked \u201cfragile\u201d. I\u2019d even pack in lots of bubble wrap to maximize shock value. But I\u2019m petty like that.", "Buy a titty glass and send that.", "I reread the post so many times too \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udee0", "Me too, god help me", "Only if it\u2019s legally a red herring\u2026", "I believe, for a small additional fee, the mailman will stand proxy and slap the recipient with said fish.\n\nSource:  I worked for the usps.  And truth be told, a lot of the carriers would pay YOU to let them slap people with fish."]}
