She's asking you to make your daughter and your friends uncomfortable in YOUR house.", "NTA it's your place and it's very rude of your sister to be acting this way.

Family *ALWAYS* invite themselves over and when you tell them NO they get butthurt.  Stick to your guns!", "NTA- you have to establish the boundary. I'd flat tell her this- if you think that weaponizing my own lake house against me is going to secure invitations.. you should massively reconsider. If you let this go now this can be the end of it and you can be assured that your summer invitations are forthcoming. If I have to hear another word about it.... you can be assured that they are not. This is a place of peace and joy only.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your place, and your choice of who to have there. \n\nIt\u2019s rude to invite one\u2019s self to someone else\u2019s home/event.", "NTA.

It's not like your never gonna have her over, she's being over the top in my opinion.", "NTA for not inviting them, it's your place, not hers. But you shouldn't have said anything about last time going well, as it blends the boundaries.

If you had said no, and she respected that, then sure don\u2019t bother mentioning the kid issue. But when she\u2019s haranguing you and torturing you over this, it\u2019s very reasonable to tell her the clear reason you have.

She isn't entitled to your vacation house.", "NTA this is your place and you have the right to pick who you want there. It\u2019s not like you have said you are never going to invite SIL.

The end.", "YTA\n\n\nIt sounds like your actively excluding the girl because of her disability and teaching your kids to do that as well.", "ESH.

This seems logical and it seems quite rude honestly that your sister feels entitled to go.  I have no problem with not wanting too large of a group and having close friends instead of your sister.\nHowever\u2026\n6 year olds are a lot and bossy.  If this child\u2019s behavior is out of line it seems like a loving one on one with your sister should have been step one instead of not inviting them.   You didn\u2019t have that conversation,  your friends didn\u2019t speak up so there we steps you could have taken .The adults need to fix this but please don\u2019t use the child as your excuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It'll be our first weekend at the lakehouse with our boat and everything ready. My wife and our friend are both teachers who just got done for summer. We just want a relaxing weekend.

Then not invite you to events because of your child\u2019s behavior?\n\nHonest question. Not starting a fight just want a polite discussion.\n\n\nPersonally I would want to be told my child is being a bully. She is bossy and the other kids don\u2019t want to play with them. This way I can address the issues. I would hate not being told and them becoming the family outcast but that\u2019s me.\n\nEdit to add: I would not or do not think the kid should be around when this is being discussed!

If it was just my sister and her husband I'd love to have them over. But he has full custody so they never go anywhere without her. Her being around changes everything and just makes it generally less fun for everyone else involved. Im hoping she grows out of that but as of a couple weeks ago when I last saw her, she's still the same way.

Having an adult conversation with her is step one.  If my sisters kid was being an asshole I would want to work with her and her child not exclude them.   I would be hurt if she didn\u2019t do the same for me.  This just feels like a bad excuse.", "You\u2019re fine. That\u2019s an understandable reason, not an excuse. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have boundaries with people.", "I get it I really do!  I just feel like having a conversation with your sister would have gone down better then just not inviting her.   As parents we all need a little help and advice. I would expect my sister to let me know I had the asshole child and work with me, not exclude me.  That hurts worse.", "Hard agree ESH. Breaks my heart to think of the reason being that they prefer to exclude a ND child. So many ways around it if they want to invite the sister\u2019s family, and so easy not to blame the child if they want to stick with not inviting them. Get the feeling OP just wanted to say his piece.", "Nope. Still a reason, not an excuse. The OP still has plans to invite the sister and her family at another time.

It would have made my childhood much more peaceful and happier.", "We had a conversation about it when she asked if they could come for memorial day. Im not throwing a huge party so there wasn't a reason to reach out to her about it proactively. When she asked if they could come I told her no because we having a low key affair with our friends. Then when she kept on pressing, I was honest with her.", "What is wrong with saying his piece? \" if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it\" only works if you can just walk away. The sister PRESSED OP AFTER BEING TOLD NO. Some people don't understand NO is a complete sentence. When trying to be nice by simply say NO doesn't work,  at this point what is wrong with telling someone who is insufferable that they are insufferable?", "OP, be careful.  If Sis knows where the house is, don't be surprised if they crash this weekend with the expectation that you won't turn her away.\n\nTurn her away at the door.  If you let her stay, she'll show up uninvited again and again.", ">She kept pressing and said we were excluding her and her family and keeping her stepdaughter from seeing her \"friends\"\n\nThis kind of thing always needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP.

No is a complete sentence. You do not have to go any further than that. Enjoy your peaceful memorial day weekend.", "NTA. Have a fun relaxing weekend as planned. Have the stressful weekend another time.", "NTA- you don\u2019t have to invite anyone family or otherwise for whatever reason you feel, you also don\u2019t have to explain your reasons for not inviting them. Have a fun weekend.", "NTA. She\u2019s not invited. Period. She\u2019ll just have to get over it. You can block her temporarily on your phone if you half to, and don\u2019t be surprised if she shows up. She sounds relentless.", "NTA - your sister didn't understand no.

It's your house and you will invite her when you want her there. She needs to stop pushing.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your rules. You aren't cutting off your sister and her stepdaughter entirely, just not this weekend. Not everyone is invited to every single thing! \n\nAnd I don't know if I'm paranoid, but I would be very concerned about whether sister just shows up anyway. You should have a game plan for what you would do in that case.", "Your vacation house, your rules. No is complete sentence.\n\nAs a thought exercise, think about how you would handle it if your sister and her family decided to show up anyway this weekend.\n\nIt goes without saying that you should not give out keys to your vacation home to anyone.", "NTA.

We feuded from early childhood through our teen years. We only recently started somewhat talking as adults in our late 20s. We still don't see eye to eye, but we finally don't hate each other. Being forced to include someone who you don't like teaches kids nothing. It teaches your daughter and her friend that their feelings are lesser than the cousin. It teaches your sister's stepdaughter that her behavior is fine. ADHD is hard. (I have it!) I dont vibe with a lot of people because of it. Your sister is probably seeing that and it's hard for parents to watch their kid get excluded. The kids will be near each other sometimes but there's no reason to force them to be together.", "NTA you\u2019re not obligated to invite anyone over ever", "NTA. She's pressuring you to invite her because she feels entitled to it. I just hope she doesn't show up and try to force her way inside.", "NTA - I wouldn't invite her ever. I only invite people who are nice to be with and definitely not people who act this entitled.", "NTA you're allowed to just hang out with friends without inviting family. I'm sure that was hard for your sister to hear tho, I imagine part of wanting to come is wanting her daughter to be included with the other girls. I hope she's able to get support for her daughters ADHD so she's less isolated.", "**NTA** \n\nYour sister is being rude and pushy. \n\nBest to send the boundary now \u2014 that she will be invited when *you* choose and that you prefer to socialize with your friends separately", "NTA.  Find out how she learned of the weekend and put a stop to that.", "NTA. There doesnt even need to be a reason beyond you dont want them there. She can be mad, and tbh i mightve been annoyed too, but theres nothing she can do. Its not her choice. You want to spend time with your friends. There is PLENTY of time for her and her family to visit.", "Stop responding and just ignore her. She is being incredibly rude so you don\u2019t have to continue being polite by responding to her.  \n\nNo matter what, do not give in to her bullying. Her behavior is 100% unacceptable and the fact that you are questioning whether or not you should give in shows you have been conditioned to it. Set up your boundaries and stick to them and eventually she will stop this behavior, at least with you. NTA", "NTA. Your house is not a hotel. She can not make a reservation. Guests are /invited/ and she has not been invited. Boundaries are a good thing in the long run, even if difficult to set up now.", "NTA. Your sister and family can go a different weekend. Don't start caving into her bad behavior, it will never end. Have a great time. You have done absolutely nothing wrong", "NTA.
