For those not from the US, this upcoming Memorial Day weekend is kind of our unofficial beginning of summer.

We also have a 5 year old daughter who is good friends with their daughter.\n\nMy sister has been asking since we got the place when she'd get to see it and we told her at some point this summer we'll have them over, and that truly is the plan. We didnt invite them for this weekend because we really wanted it to be a nice relaxing weekend and my sisters stepdaughter is just a lot sometimes. She means well but she has bad ADHD and can be very very loud and shrieky. When we had a birthday party for our daughter 6 months ago, she was all over the place, our daughter and our friends daughter both said she was trying to be bossy and take control of everything while they were just trying to play their own games. My friends are too nice to say anything but we could tell they were annoyed too. Given that my wife and I arent really fans of her and the kids arent either, we just wanted this weekend to be peaceful and figured we'd invite them another time. \n\nWell now my sister found out that we are going there this weekend and got really mad I didnt invite her.

But you don\u2019t have to give her a reason - I wouldn\u2019t say anything more about her kid. It\u2019s your house and you were generous enough to say you\u2019d invite her this summer. Not this specific week. Your sister sounds insane", "NTA. You didn't invite her, she doesn't get to invite herself. Why is she entitled to your house?", "NTA. She's asking you to make your daughter and your friends uncomfortable in YOUR house.", "NTA it's your place and it's very rude of your sister to be acting this way. I guess we know where the stepdaughter has the bossyness from..", "NTA \u2026 your house, your decision. Let your sister know that, if she pushes this, she won\u2019t be coming this summer at all !", "NTA - This is a problem with vacation homes.  Family *ALWAYS* invite themselves over and when you tell them NO they get butthurt.  Stick to your guns!", "NTA- you have to establish the boundary. I'd flat tell her this- if you think that weaponizing my own lake house against me is going to secure invitations.. you should massively reconsider. If you let this go now this can be the end of it and you can be assured that your summer invitations are forthcoming. If I have to hear another word about it.... you can be assured that they are not. This is a place of peace and joy only.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your place, and your choice of who to have there. \n\nIt\u2019s rude to invite one\u2019s self to someone else\u2019s home/event.", "NTA. In my opinion she can wait. It's your house, your rules. She should respect that. It's not like your never gonna have her over, she's being over the top in my opinion.", "NTA for not inviting them, it's your place, not hers. But you shouldn't have said anything about last time going well, as it blends the boundaries. If you say no, it means no, regardless of who has said what in the past.", "NTA and your sister pressing the issue means it was totally appropriate to tell her why. If you had said no, and she respected that, then sure don\u2019t bother mentioning the kid issue. But when she\u2019s haranguing you and torturing you over this, it\u2019s very reasonable to tell her the clear reason you have. In an ideal world, she would take that feedback into account, but here in the real world, she probably won\u2019t.", "NTA. It's your house, you can do whatever you want.\n\n\"We've planned (this) for the weekend. You and come (another weekend) instead\".", "NTA it\u2019s your home your entitled to invite who you want. Your sister seem very entitled to preside someone to invite her to a place they don\u2019t want her at.\n\nI am a firm believer you don\u2019t force kids to hand out with others that are mean and bully them.", "NTA. It is your house you can invite whoever you want. And you don't have to invite your sister. Especially as it is your first long weekend there. \n\nDon't let you be guilt into letting them come.", "Tell her to drop it as you\u2019ve clearly said no multiple times, and that if she doesn\u2019t then there won\u2019t be a weekend this summer that they are invited.  You sister can go buy her own lake place if she doesn\u2019t like it.  NTA 100%.", "As you said, you plan to have them over this summer. You aren't excluding them, merely delaying. Demanding an invitation to something that is not yours smacks of entitlement.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n She is your sister, not your kid. She isn't entitled to your vacation house.", "NTA this is your place and you have the right to pick who you want there. It\u2019s not like you have said you are never going to invite SIL. To be honest she sounds very entitled, demanding other people\u2019s resources for her benefit. \n\nI do wonder if she\u2019s going to turn up anyway.", "NTA. You already have plans to invite them to *your* lake house, just not during that weekend.", "NTA, this is why partner and I say if we ever buy a lake house, nobody in our family can know about it.", "Your house. Your rules.\nIf she paying the mortgage? No? Then she can STFU.\n\nNTA.", "NTA it\u2019s your home your entitled to invite who you want. Your sister seem very entitled to preside someone to invite her to a place they don\u2019t want her at.\n\nI am a firm believer you don\u2019t force kids to hand out with others that are mean and bully them.", "Clearly NTA, but it doesn't need to be about your sister's daughter. Maybe just figure out another weekend and make some plans. Or not, you're not obligated to hang out with your sister. I would just avoid making it about the kid.", "Nta. It is your house not your sister's. She does not get a voice in who visits. Explain to her that if this behavior continues she will never be welcome at your vacation home. How rude of her to decide she has rights to your home. Stand up to her now or this behavior will just continue to happen.", "NTA she's more worried about a weekend in the water and she needs to be worried about her kid.", "NTA\n\nWell, you let the cat out of the bag, so no going back. But try not to feel too bad about it. Unless you and your sister have all the same friends and do everything together, why would you invite her?\n\nThis is a weekend you have chosen to spend time with just these friends. We do that as adults.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour sister for obvious reasons.  You, for bringing up her stepdaughter's behaviour and that the other kids don't like her.  \n\nAll you had to say was \"We're having over friends for the holiday, we'll do a family weekend in the summer\" or whatever. The end.", "YTA\n\n\nIt sounds like your actively excluding the girl because of her disability and teaching your kids to do that as well.", "ESH. Your sister , for assuming that she can invite herself, not take no for an answer and continuing to text you about it.\n\nAnd you, for using your daughter and her friend as a scapegoat instead of owning the fact that you don\u2019t like her step daughter. \n\n being firm and offering another weekend option kindly would have been a great option,   but tattletaling and putting *your OWN DAUGHTER* in a potentially awkward position in the future was definitely not.", "ESH\n\nI think you are absolutely fine saying that this weekend you are having friends to the lake house and you'd rather get together with them another time. \n\nI think making it about their daughter's medical condition that neither she nor they can control is an AH thing to do. \n\nInvite the friends this weekend, but maybe find a different time when you could go to the lake house and invite your sister's family to come too.", "YTA for using a 6 year old as an excuse.\nThis is the first memorial weekend you have had at your new place and you have every right to want to keep it low key.  This seems logical and it seems quite rude honestly that your sister feels entitled to go.  I have no problem with not wanting too large of a group and having close friends instead of your sister.\nHowever\u2026\n6 year olds are a lot and bossy.  If this child\u2019s behavior is out of line it seems like a loving one on one with your sister should have been step one instead of not inviting them.   You didn\u2019t have that conversation,  your friends didn\u2019t speak up so there we steps you could have taken .The adults need to fix this but please don\u2019t use the child as your excuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In my opinion people like her legitimately need an \u201cintervention\u201d where someone in their life is willing to tell them the truth.

Your sister, however, is an overly entitled AH. You TOLD HER that you'd have her over some time this summer. That should have been good enough. It's your house. You have the right to invite your friends over without your sister being present. \n\nI would say that your sister has just lost any future invites to your house.", "NTA- tell her NO means NO.\n\nRidiculous that she keeps insisting she gets invited.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if she shows up anyway tho. \n\n\nMaybe just be honest with her and tell her that you don\u2019t want to deal with her rowdy kid .

You're not being malicious but truthful, obviously do it after the trip.

Your house, your timing, your decisions. It's not like they're barred - they simply have to wait. Sounds like they had no plans for the long holiday weekend and expected you to make it an all-family affair weekend. You're allowed to say No whether it's because of your step-niece or not.

Haha.\n\nThanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude03", "Not once did they say that in the post.", "I think she will if she knows where the house is.", "That was my initial reasoning before she kept pressing.", "I think the mom should be told about the step daughters behavior. I think addressing the issue and giving the parents time to correct the child\u2019s behavior is better then always excluding the child because of the behavior.", "Its not because of a disability its her behavior that makes everyone else have a worse time. It'll be our first weekend at the lakehouse with our boat and everything ready. My wife and our friend are both teachers who just got done for summer. We just want a relaxing weekend. Im not saying our daughters are perfect but they arent constantly running around or shrieking. They're both pretty mild mannered for their age and have  a lot of fun together. When the other girl is thrown in the mix, it just becomes a worse time for everyone else.", "Excluding her for a weekend because of her behaviour. Everyone is entitled to some time where their needs are met, it\u2019s healthy to teach kids to advocate for themselves too.", "Its not just me, none of us like her stepdaughter. The reason I said the thing about my daughter is because my sister said I was depriving her of her friends. I corrected her that they aren't friends. Im realizing now that I probably shouldn't have said that, but its the truth.", "I am not arguing but asking an honest question?\n\nParents would you rather someone come to you and tell you listen your child\u2019s behavior is causing problems. She is being bossy and bulling the other kids to the point they don\u2019t want to be around her?\n\nOr \n\nWould you want family members to be nice to your face but think oh hell here they come with that kid? Then not invite you to events because of your child\u2019s behavior?\n\nHonest question. Not starting a fight just want a polite discussion.\n\n\nPersonally I would want to be told my child is being a bully. She is bossy and the other kids don\u2019t want to play with them. This way I can address the issues. I would hate not being told and them becoming the family outcast but that\u2019s me.\n\nEdit to add: I would not or do not think the kid should be around when this is being discussed! I think if your going to have a conversation with a parent. It should be held in private. When no other or children are present.", ">Invite the friends this weekend, but maybe find a different time when you could go to the lake house and invite your sister's family to come too.\n\nThats exactly what he said he's doing", "Not wanting a disruptive kid who makes your own daughter uncomfortable is not \u201cusing a 6 year old as an excuse.\u201d It\u2019s a legitimate reason to not invite them.", "I get what you're saying but Im not using her as an excuse. If it was just my sister and her husband I'd love to have them over. But he has full custody so they never go anywhere without her. Her being around changes everything and just makes it generally less fun for everyone else involved. Im hoping she grows out of that but as of a couple weeks ago when I last saw her, she's still the same way. Its not regular behavior for a kid her age, I have a daughter that age and am involved in her school, my wife is also an elementary school teacher. She is an outlier behavior wise.", "I also typically hang out with my friends and my family separately. Just because I invited friends over *does not* mean my family is welcome to crash lol", ">Thats when I finally told her what  my daughter and friends daughter said the last time they hung out with her and htat did not go well either.\n\nFrom the post.", "Yeah, and it should have been your second/third/fourth answer too.\n\nWhen someone hears the same response over and over, they get the picture that the discussion is over.", "Don't listen to this guy. NTA.\n\nOP you don't need a reason to when and who you (don't) invite to your own property. Don't let that kind of entitlement fly.\n\nPointing out your sister's claim about the niece being deprived of seeing her friends is false, by telling her the truth that no one really likes her is perfectly her is valid. Some people just can't sense that other people don't enjoy their company/presence, you just need to be blunt and let them know.", "This is op sister not some random kid in the playground.  Having an adult conversation with her is step one.  If my sisters kid was being an asshole I would want to work with her and her child not exclude them.   I would be hurt if she didn\u2019t do the same for me.  This just feels like a bad excuse.", "You\u2019re fine. That\u2019s an understandable reason, not an excuse. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have boundaries with people.", "I get it I really do!  I just feel like having a conversation with your sister would have gone down better then just not inviting her.   As parents we all need a little help and advice. I would expect my sister to let me know I had the asshole child and work with me, not exclude me.  That hurts worse.", "Hard agree ESH. Breaks my heart to think of the reason being that they prefer to exclude a ND child. So many ways around it if they want to invite the sister\u2019s family, and so easy not to blame the child if they want to stick with not inviting them. Get the feeling OP just wanted to say his piece.", "Nope. Still a reason, not an excuse. The OP still has plans to invite the sister and her family at another time. The sister has no right to try to intrude on their time with their friends. She\u2019s being entitled.", "I wish my parents didnt make us include assholes who happened to be related to us growing up. It would have made my childhood much more peaceful and happier.", "We had a conversation about it when she asked if they could come for memorial day. Im not throwing a huge party so there wasn't a reason to reach out to her about it proactively. When she asked if they could come I told her no because we having a low key affair with our friends. Then when she kept on pressing, I was honest with her.", "What is wrong with saying his piece? \" if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it\" only works if you can just walk away. The sister PRESSED OP AFTER BEING TOLD NO. Some people don't understand NO is a complete sentence. When trying to be nice by simply say NO doesn't work,  at this point what is wrong with telling someone who is insufferable that they are insufferable?"]}
