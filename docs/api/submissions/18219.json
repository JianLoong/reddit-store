She's asking you to make your daughter and your friends uncomfortable in YOUR house.", "NTA it's your place and it's very rude of your sister to be acting this way.

Family *ALWAYS* invite themselves over and when you tell them NO they get butthurt.  Stick to your guns!", "NTA- you have to establish the boundary. I'd flat tell her this- if you think that weaponizing my own lake house against me is going to secure invitations.. you should massively reconsider. If you let this go now this can be the end of it and you can be assured that your summer invitations are forthcoming. If I have to hear another word about it.... you can be assured that they are not. This is a place of peace and joy only.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your place, and your choice of who to have there. \n\nIt\u2019s rude to invite one\u2019s self to someone else\u2019s home/event.", "NTA.

It's not like your never gonna have her over, she's being over the top in my opinion.", "NTA for not inviting them, it's your place, not hers. But you shouldn't have said anything about last time going well, as it blends the boundaries.

If you had said no, and she respected that, then sure don\u2019t bother mentioning the kid issue. But when she\u2019s haranguing you and torturing you over this, it\u2019s very reasonable to tell her the clear reason you have.

She isn't entitled to your vacation house.", "NTA this is your place and you have the right to pick who you want there. It\u2019s not like you have said you are never going to invite SIL.

This seems logical and it seems quite rude honestly that your sister feels entitled to go.  I have no problem with not wanting too large of a group and having close friends instead of your sister.\nHowever\u2026\n6 year olds are a lot and bossy.  If this child\u2019s behavior is out of line it seems like a loving one on one with your sister should have been step one instead of not inviting them.   You didn\u2019t have that conversation,  your friends didn\u2019t speak up so there we steps you could have taken .The adults need to fix this but please don\u2019t use the child as your excuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It'll be our first weekend at the lakehouse with our boat and everything ready. My wife and our friend are both teachers who just got done for summer. We just want a relaxing weekend.

Then not invite you to events because of your child\u2019s behavior?\n\nHonest question. Not starting a fight just want a polite discussion.\n\n\nPersonally I would want to be told my child is being a bully. She is bossy and the other kids don\u2019t want to play with them. This way I can address the issues. I would hate not being told and them becoming the family outcast but that\u2019s me.\n\nEdit to add: I would not or do not think the kid should be around when this is being discussed!

If it was just my sister and her husband I'd love to have them over. But he has full custody so they never go anywhere without her. Her being around changes everything and just makes it generally less fun for everyone else involved. Im hoping she grows out of that but as of a couple weeks ago when I last saw her, she's still the same way.

Having an adult conversation with her is step one.  If my sisters kid was being an asshole I would want to work with her and her child not exclude them.   I would be hurt if she didn\u2019t do the same for me.  This just feels like a bad excuse.", "You\u2019re fine. That\u2019s an understandable reason, not an excuse. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have boundaries with people.", "I get it I really do!  I just feel like having a conversation with your sister would have gone down better then just not inviting her.   As parents we all need a little help and advice. I would expect my sister to let me know I had the asshole child and work with me, not exclude me.  That hurts worse.", "Hard agree ESH. Breaks my heart to think of the reason being that they prefer to exclude a ND child. So many ways around it if they want to invite the sister\u2019s family, and so easy not to blame the child if they want to stick with not inviting them. Get the feeling OP just wanted to say his piece.", "Nope. Still a reason, not an excuse. The OP still has plans to invite the sister and her family at another time.

It would have made my childhood much more peaceful and happier.", "We had a conversation about it when she asked if they could come for memorial day. Im not throwing a huge party so there wasn't a reason to reach out to her about it proactively. When she asked if they could come I told her no because we having a low key affair with our friends. Then when she kept on pressing, I was honest with her.", "What is wrong with saying his piece? \" if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it\" only works if you can just walk away. The sister PRESSED OP AFTER BEING TOLD NO. Some people don't understand NO is a complete sentence. When trying to be nice by simply say NO doesn't work,  at this point what is wrong with telling someone who is insufferable that they are insufferable?", "OP, be careful.  If Sis knows where the house is, don't be surprised if they crash this weekend with the expectation that you won't turn her away.\n\nTurn her away at the door.  If you let her stay, she'll show up uninvited again and again.", ">She kept pressing and said we were excluding her and her family and keeping her stepdaughter from seeing her \"friends\"\n\nThis kind of thing always needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP.

No is a complete sentence. You do not have to go any further than that. Enjoy your peaceful memorial day weekend.", "NTA. Have a fun relaxing weekend as planned. Have the stressful weekend another time.", "NTA- you don\u2019t have to invite anyone family or otherwise for whatever reason you feel, you also don\u2019t have to explain your reasons for not inviting them. Have a fun weekend.", "NTA. She\u2019s not invited. Period. She\u2019ll just have to get over it. You can block her temporarily on your phone if you half to, and don\u2019t be surprised if she shows up. She sounds relentless.", "NTA - your sister didn't understand no.

It's your house and you will invite her when you want her there. She needs to stop pushing.", "NTA. \n\nYour house, your rules. You aren't cutting off your sister and her stepdaughter entirely, just not this weekend. Not everyone is invited to every single thing! \n\nAnd I don't know if I'm paranoid, but I would be very concerned about whether sister just shows up anyway. You should have a game plan for what you would do in that case.", "Your vacation house, your rules. No is complete sentence.\n\nAs a thought exercise, think about how you would handle it if your sister and her family decided to show up anyway this weekend.\n\nIt goes without saying that you should not give out keys to your vacation home to anyone.", "NTA.

We feuded from early childhood through our teen years. We only recently started somewhat talking as adults in our late 20s. We still don't see eye to eye, but we finally don't hate each other. Being forced to include someone who you don't like teaches kids nothing. It teaches your daughter and her friend that their feelings are lesser than the cousin. It teaches your sister's stepdaughter that her behavior is fine. ADHD is hard. (I have it!) I dont vibe with a lot of people because of it. Your sister is probably seeing that and it's hard for parents to watch their kid get excluded. The kids will be near each other sometimes but there's no reason to force them to be together.", "NTA you\u2019re not obligated to invite anyone over ever", "NTA. She's pressuring you to invite her because she feels entitled to it. I just hope she doesn't show up and try to force her way inside.", "NTA - I wouldn't invite her ever. I only invite people who are nice to be with and definitely not people who act this entitled.", "NTA you're allowed to just hang out with friends without inviting family. I'm sure that was hard for your sister to hear tho, I imagine part of wanting to come is wanting her daughter to be included with the other girls. I hope she's able to get support for her daughters ADHD so she's less isolated.", "**NTA** \n\nYour sister is being rude and pushy. \n\nBest to send the boundary now \u2014 that she will be invited when *you* choose and that you prefer to socialize with your friends separately", "NTA.  Find out how she learned of the weekend and put a stop to that.", "NTA. There doesnt even need to be a reason beyond you dont want them there. She can be mad, and tbh i mightve been annoyed too, but theres nothing she can do. Its not her choice. You want to spend time with your friends. There is PLENTY of time for her and her family to visit.", "Stop responding and just ignore her. She is being incredibly rude so you don\u2019t have to continue being polite by responding to her.  \n\nNo matter what, do not give in to her bullying. Her behavior is 100% unacceptable and the fact that you are questioning whether or not you should give in shows you have been conditioned to it. Set up your boundaries and stick to them and eventually she will stop this behavior, at least with you. NTA", "NTA. Your house is not a hotel. She can not make a reservation. Guests are /invited/ and she has not been invited. Boundaries are a good thing in the long run, even if difficult to set up now.", "NTA. Your sister and family can go a different weekend. Don't start caving into her bad behavior, it will never end. Have a great time. You have done absolutely nothing wrong", "NTA.

So understanding what they do and why they do things is important. This can help how you tolerate and ultimately handle the child's behaviors. Do not leave it all up to your sister. Gentle interventions into any play is important to maintain peace and encourage proper growth in social situations because they /literally can't help themselves/ even if they /know better/. \n\n\n Whole adhd family here. I was completely excluded from my entire family as a child and now that I am an adult because I was \"different\" no one calls me. I haven't spoken to anyone in 9 years and it's really lonely. now I watch as my son (adhd) gets passed up by my inlaws for events. They dont even mind saying to us how hes a \"bit too much for them\" They also do this to my epileptic autistic neice. Bless him he can be pretty naive about it all but it really hurts to be excluded and I see this in how desperate he is to please and get attention from other family. \n\nThey will be rightfully upset because you put friends first, after they already asked you to let them come over.

It will not be easy, but I suggest some deeper research into how to help kids with adhd as well as understanding they can't help but mess up and need a lot more \"do this instead\" interventions not just \"don't do that\" so on and so forth because this will help with how your perceived his behavior or tolerate it.

Neither is the social consequences of doing so.", "One of my good friends has an adult son on the spectrum and she never set limits for him as a child bc she felt guilty. He's now 6'2\", 250lbs and violently rages when he doesn't get his way. I fear that one day he'll beat her to death.", "As the one who was always stuck watching the younger kids while their parents talked and ignored their responsibilities... I feel this.", "I get the feeling that the niece doesn't have any friends because of the way she acts and is trying to push a friendship with ops kid", "I rarely see extended family at all, even those who live fairly close by.  Why are so many people so far into their family's business that they feel slighted if they're not automatically included in everything?", "Hard agree. I get it, no one likes to be left out, but I am startled by how many grown adults freak out to the NC/\u201chow dare they!!\u201d level when they or their spouse or kid isn\u2019t invited to something. There are some circumstances where I get it, but people act like it\u2019s some kind of crime if someone doesn\u2019t want their/their spouse\u2019s/their kids company in every instance that they want want to be there. People are not obligated to want to hang out with anyone all the time and not everyone is going to love or even like you. Some people are better friends than other or closer family members. I feel like most people learn this growing up and come to terms with it, but to here AITA tell it, it\u2019s a cardinal sin smh.", "NTA", "NTA.  When your sister buys a beach house she can invite anyone she pleases.  This is your place and nobody has any say about who you ask to accompany you", "I agree! \"No\" means no. I don't even need to have a reason and I will not give any excuse. When I say \"No\" that's all I'm saying. Otherwise people just argue with you and give you reasons why they think you are wrong. Just say no and walk away.", "Yes, it is hard. All parenting is hard, but raising a child with behavioral needs is a whole different kind of hard. You have to figure out your child's specific needs, determine boundaries and expectations that are reasonable, and figure out which consequences actually work on your child. \n\nIn the meantime, you're stuck physically removing your (increasingly heavy) child from unsafe and/or socially inappropriate situations, enduring up to hours of screaming when your child cannot be soothed, and knowing the entire time that your child is suffering and you don't know how to ease their pain. Meanwhile, judgmental assholes are giving you the side-eye because \"he just needs boundaries/consequences.\" If only it were that simple.\n\nMy son is on the autism spectrum and he had a really rough time in his early years. Parenting books and our friends' and families' experiences didn't really apply to him because he didn't respond to things the way most children do. We had a lot of trial and error and a very miserable child until he was about 6 years old. Those were the most stressful 6 years of my life and I'm just glad my now-14-year-old doesn't remember them.\n\nPlease don't try to tell me that raising my son was easy. I am so grateful for my brave, sweet, quirky teen, but getting him through those early years was the hardest thing I've ever done. I wouldn't hesitate to do it all again because my kid is worth it; but kind Redditor, don't ever try to tell me, or any parent of a neurodivergent child, that it's been easy.", "I have ADHD too, but my brother and I were parented very differently. He was let to run wild, my mother took the \"boys will be boys\" approach with him, while I was consistently knocked back for the most minor infractions. I don't think this did either of us any favors, but he definitely got the worse deal.", "Thank you. \n\nFWIW, I have appropriate degrees from prestigious universities & a 40+ year career in neuropsychology. That someone (without a Y- chromosome) wants to berate my argument strictly on the basis of my gender is quite the example of ironic humor.", "I worked for an airline for 20 years. The very first time I met my husbands aunt (outside a grocery store) she asked me for free tickets for her whole family to Vancouver. \nShe wasn\u2019t joking.", "If you were speaking about me, I was disagreeing with the fact that he implied that disciplining neurodivergent children is the same as raising neurotypical children.\nIt isn\u2019t. \nFurther, the way he mentioned \u201cstrict\u201d with the discipline reminded me of parents who don\u2019t know to pivot and give grace when required.\n\nFor example. You go to dinner with your kids at a place that plays music. The music is louder than you expect. ASD child copes as well as he can but eventually starts crying or melting down and may not be able to articulate why. Parent A might get angry, tell them they expect them to behave, maybe issue a threat, etc. Parent B knows the child is not trying to misbehave , but they are overstimulated by the light, noises , etc. \n\nIf you were the ASD kid and had Parent A, think of how much worse your existence would be simply because your parents were applying the same disciplinary rules to you as your NT siblings. Siblings who *would* be subject to discipline because theirs would be a tantrum, not a meltdown.

If she shows up tell her sorry but this weekend you already have plans. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she did just show up. You really have to set boundaries on your place. Your sister won\u2019t be the only ones trying to invite themselves to your place, seen this happen before. You owe no one explanations. You\u2019ll find it easier as you go along.", "OP looks down on her and his sister. It\u2019s really a bad look.", "EXACTLY THIS.  She's already made the whole weekend a drama and it hasn't even started yet and she's not even invited.  \n\nCut the drama.  Enjoy your holiday.  You think there's going to be LESS drama when she's physically there?  No.", ">they brought drugs to the property\n\nI am sure your beach house was a risk of being seized by the Police or DEA for having drugs at the house.
