My fianc\u00e9 just told me his parents are planning a family trip to Florida (where I really wanted to go for my birthday but didn\u2019t because of health issues) for 4 days the week before Thanksgiving to go to Disney and all that, and I\u2019m not invited.\n\nImportant back story I was just recently diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. It can cause thinks like rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, trouble breathing, etc. I\u2019ve been to the ER twice in less then 4 months once by ambulance. Needless to say it\u2019s not safe for me to be home alone.\n\nMy immediate reaction was what the fuck? I asked him am I not family? I told him that I was upset and he was like \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d but he could. He could fight for me to be able to go or not go himself. And I told him I wouldn\u2019t let my family do that to him, I wouldn\u2019t let anyone exclude him especially if he was disabled. He insists there is nothing he could do and he\u2019s gonna go so I\u2019m sitting here rethinking our relationship cause to me this is fucked up that I will be left home alone to take care of all of our animals plus his brothers animals by myself for 4 days knowing I will struggle and it could be dangerous for me to be home alone.\n\nI feel like I might be TAH because I\u2019m obviously not entitled to go on the trip but I also think it\u2019s shitty that I\u2019ve lived here for 2 years being part of the family just to be excluded from a \u201cfamily\u201d trip. Part of me thinks it\u2019s because of my illness they just don\u2019t want to deal with me. And I\u2019m even more hurt that my fianc\u00e9 is okay excluding my.\n\nTLDR fianc\u00e9s family is leaving me behind while they go on a family trip and I\u2019m upset.\n\nEDIT: before anyone is confused I don\u2019t except them to pay for me, they are paying for their 4 sons, but Im not even being given the option of paying for myself. And I do pay rent here it\u2019s not much but it\u2019s as much as I can afford.\n\nAlso to avoid answering the same complaints over and over again, \n\nif they did parks and rides I\u2019d be fine staying in the hotel room or hotel pool to avoid the heat and loads of walking. I also have a wheelchair for when we go out to try and avoid being dizzy and walking to keep my heart rate low. Being disabled doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t exist outside my home. I definitely need to be more careful but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t exist outside the house \n\nI don\u2019t have family or really any friends that could help nearby. He and I knew that when I moved here 2 years ago if anything were to happen he\u2019s all I have. \n\nI would never demand that he stays home, I voiced my concerns to him and left it at that. I don\u2019t expect him to wait on my hand and foot. If there was an emergency he\u2019d end up coming home.\n\nI\u2019m fine to be left in a hotel all day I am worried about being left alone for days, no I don\u2019t expect to be \u201cgallivanting\u201d around Disney if I were to go, I just want to be near him if there was an emergency rather then waiting for him to try and get a flight home. I know my limits, I have no interest in pushing them. \n\nI have no issue with them wanting to go on a trip and spend time with their sons, im worried about the safety of being left alone for days and the possibility of him having to catch an emergency fight home. Im said it\u2019s framed as a family trip but im not being seen as family while being told I am family. We\u2019ve been together since 2016 im in no way new to them.", "created_utc": 1693877091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16aadgg/aitah_for_being_upset_im_being_excluded_from_a/", "score": 281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know the issue and it does not sound like you should be going to the ER every time you faint\u2026  That part is strange for me as someone who frequents the ER not sure what you\u2019re doing there and why he would need to fly back from a 4 day trip for a non life threatening condition that everyone is well aware of.", "Cost of your hotel room should be in the $500 range per night. That's 2 months of what you can afford in rent, per night. You're willing to spent thousands to not experience Disney but - according to some of your comments - stay in the hotel room. With a non-zero risk that you may have another medical emergency which your fiancee & family would have to manage. There are cheaper ways to make sure you will be ok; you could hire a pet-sitter to stay in the house to take care of the animals and keep an eye on you! Or get a webcam for long distance friends to check on you periodically. Or have friends phone you every couple of hours. Or pay for an old friend to come hang out with you while they're gone. Or get a life-alert type device - a much better long-term investment of that kind of money than tagging along with this family. \n\nYou're saying that your fiancee should lovingly unselfishly refuse to leave you at this still-delicate time; but also shouldn't you lovingly unselfishly refuse to be a burden that holds him back from a cool vacation? (And if they had invited you, shouldn't you refuse to impose on them?)\n\nYTA", "Info:  I want to better understand the dynamics here are you employed, and do you contribute either in chores or monetarily to the family?", "Since your condition seems fairly recent would you even qualify for travel medical insurance if you have an issue in Florida?\nHow do you propose to pay your cost if you can only afford to pay $250 / month in rent?", "YTA it\u2019s very normal for people to go on trips with only their biological family and it\u2019s literally only for 4 days. If you came it sounds like you\u2019d expect him to spend most of the trip looking after you. Your logic doesn\u2019t make sense at all you can\u2019t be left alone, but you\u2019re happy to be alone in a hotel room? If your illness is so bad you can\u2019t be home alone then you\u2019d need to consider a carer instead of expecting your fianc\u00e9 to take you absolutely everywhere with him and not be able to go out and enjoy a holiday because he has to look after you 24/7. Being alone for days is the same as being alone for 8 hours while he\u2019s at Disney. Disney is packed and crowded and he may not even see if you message him so if you faint he still won\u2019t be able to be there as soon as possible. You need to plan what to do if something happens to you that isn\u2019t only relying on him. Many people with POTS live alone. \n\nYou only care because youre jealous and want to go to Florida and now you\u2019re guilt tripping him into taking you. Disney is expensive, you can only afford $250 a month on rent and you keep avoiding people asking you how exactly you\u2019re going to pay for it", "I hate to say it, but maybe his family just wants to get away for 4 days of fun without having to worry about your health needs?\nI have a good friend with POTS ( she is 50 ) and she lived alone without issues.\nShe doesn\u2019t drive and just takes an Uber when required.\nIf you are concerned about falling you should consider getting a Lifeline medical device.", "YTA, living with someone for two years doesn't make you family. I have a couple relatives that married into the family via my aunts and uncles over five years ago, and I still don't see them as family compared to my aunts and uncles who have been around my entire life. It will happen eventually as you stay together, but pushing the whole 'but I'm family and should be on every trip you do' will only make them push back.\n\nAnd you say in your comments that you don't mind being not being included in every trip, but also that you're more comfortable close to your fiance wherever he goes... so since he'll be on every family trip that his family does... you are effectively arguing that you should be on every family trip his family does. You see how it goes in a circle and reaches the same conclusion?\n\nHonestly, I'm guessing the real issue is that your fiance is your entire support system and he's burning out. You said you don't have friends or family around and everything rides on him, which is a difficult position for him to be in. I mean, you're so dependent on him that you think he's horrible to leave you alone on a trip with his family for FOUR days.\n\nNo matter what happens with this trip, you need to find a new support system where you're living now, because there will inevitably be times when your partner travels without you (business trips, trips with friends, more family trips, etc.), and you can't keep dealing with that by guilting him into taking you or staying home.", "Can you afford the trip?", "YTA! Op is being selfish and self centered. Why would the family want to take along someone who would need constant attention, and says they would be ok in a hotel room and being pushed in a wheelchair. Even having someone around who would be in a hotel room and all that is not an enjoyable time for the family. Its always going to be in their mind that you are in the hotel waiting for them to return. You say you can be left alone, so how are they supposed to have a good time on THEIR vacation worrying about you? And then having to find accommodations to suit YOUR needs. And having your fiance' push you around the parks in a wheelchair? How  much fun is that for them? Going out to eat and finding room for your wheelchair and all this.. JUST NO! You are not family yet. They have no obligation to you. Getting you in and out of the car and dealing with your wheelchair and catering to you is not my idea of a vacation! If you and your fiance' want to go to Disney on your time, fine. Expecting this family to deal with you is ridiculous!", "Move out. This is your sign.", "YTA and entitled AF. Do you want people to start treating you in a \u201cspecial\u201d way because you are disabled? I would think that\u2019s disrespectful. It\u2019s four days! Your boyfriend is allowed to have a life outside you! What if he breaks up with you? Who would be your caretaker then?", "YTA . Unless you're married, don't assume they see you as family yet. You also sound like you're a lot to handle. I don't blame them for wanting a break from you and the mom has every right to spend time with her son's and make memories without the gf being there.", "INFO Can you even afford to go? You're only paying 250/month in rent cuz you say that's all you can afford. Four days at Disney would be hundreds of dollars. That's just for tickets and food, not even counting the hotel or travel. They pbly know you can't afford it in addition to you not being well enough to deal with the heat and lines.", "Info:  Do you honestly believe that going to Disney is safer than staying home?   Or are you just trying to get your fiance to stay with you instead?", "YTA that is not fair on your bf that you put your entire health and safety into his hands. He should be able to have a life outside of you without having to worry about you every second. You need to find outside resources to help you manage", "NTA\n\nYour BF is an AH for not standing up for you.\n\nYou should rethink your relationship, and if possible be gone when they return.", "\"Needless to say it\u2019s not safe for me to be home alone.\"  \nMaybe they think it's not safe for to travel, either.", "NAH\n\nI rarely think anyone is TAH for their feelings... you feel sad and excluded. By your account, you expressed that once and let the conversation end. \n\nYou can feel these things and not attempt to bully yourself into the trip or leave him though. \n\nEveryone at every stage of life needs to do things without their partner. If your health is the primary reason you want to be together you honestly need a better plan than keeping your fiance within arms reach because it sounds like it's dangerously close to codependency which won't be good for your safety or relationship in the long run.", "Not being invited to a trip with a family that you\u2019ve been a part of for so long before you even moved in, must really hurt. Rejection is a bitter pill to swallow but please consider their point of view as well\u2026\n\nI\u2019m gonna be brutally honest here OP, I have a feeling they just want a break from you. Just reading your frantic replies, I\u2019m getting dizzy myself. \n\nI can imagine being new to a POTS diagnosis is scary. You haven\u2019t figured out how to manage it well enough and you can\u2019t quite yet tell which string of symptoms lead to a minor and which to a major episode. Being left alone is scary but it is also an opportunity to learn to listen to your body and learn more about triggers and how to deal with symptoms. Everyone who says \u201ciT\u2019s NoT tHaT bAd. IT\u2019s NoT eVeN dEaDly\u201d never had to deal with what feels like the world crumbling around you as you hit the floor and hope you didn\u2019t crack your head open.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot for you. It\u2019s also a lot for them. While not being invited is kinda rude and absolutely sucks, no one ever \u201cowes\u201d it to you to take care of you and maybe they\u2019re taking this opportunity to take care of themselves mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re left behind but you can embrace this opportunity of having the house all to yourself and do some fun shit! Or relaxing shit.", "YTA, you keep saying you wouldn't let your family do that to him, but you live with your fiance's family and you can't get anyone from your family to check on you for 4 days? I see why you're upset about your fiance going, I wouldn't leave if I were him, but even though you recently were diagnosed, this sounds like a lifetime condition and you need to figure out a way to handle being alone. Especially with technology now, shouldn't be hard to set up a check-in type call from people.", "I\u2019m kind of conflicted..I understand why you are upset.  However on the other hand I can see why you might have been excluded.  Your health condition makes Disney a not so great destination.  While fun, Disney can be overwhelming.  What if you got sick there? \n\nHave your doctors told you can\u2019t be alone?  If taking care of the pets for 4 days is a challenge, Disney will be difficult for you to navigate.  For that reason YTA", "YTA. It\u2019s fine for them to want to take a trip with just their kids, there aren\u2019t any other SOs and you don\u2019t have to be included in everything.\n\nNot wanting to be home alone is a separate issue, if you are not comfortable go stay with a friend or have someone stay over. Or even just arrange for someone to stop by and check on you every evening. There are solutions other than relying on fianc\u00e9", "I'm saying this as someone who has chronic illnesses too - YTA. Let them have a break.", "NAH- First, they are allowed to take a family vacation with them and their kids. I think it\u2019s gracious they let you live there for a fixed low rent. I think you are being a bit bratty. It\u2019s okay that your feelings are hurt. It\u2019s okay to feel left out. It\u2019s even okay to decline taking care of anyone\u2019s pets but your own if it\u2019s really too much for you. But you can\u2019t expect your fianc\u00e9 to stick to you like glue 24/7. In some comments, you say you can\u2019t be alone and other comments you chastise people for suggesting this time of vacation wouldn\u2019t be in your best interest. So I think it really does come down to having a bit of a hissy on your part.", "OP - I understand you don\u2019t want to be alone in case something happens. Say you go on the trip with SO\u2019s  family. Do you really think your fianc\u00e9\u2019s going to let you spend all the time by yourself in a hotel room when you have constantly said how you can\u2019t be alone because something could happen medically, especially because you said if something happened medically he\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. he\u2019s going to most likely stay with you in that hotel room so you\u2019re not alone.", "YTA\n\nPeople get to go on vacation with who ever they want to.  Parents are allowed to take just their kids on vacation.  Inviting other people (even people that live with them) changes the dynamic.\n\nYou're also the AH for saying your boyfriend shouldn't go.  Why would you strip an opportunity from him due to your jealousy?", "YTA because you seem to be really needy about being taken care of. I don\u2019t know anyone with your condition that can\u2019t be left alone? And who are you going to hire to watch your pets if you went?", "YTA dude\n\nthey are going with their sons, what does that have go to do with you? \n\nyou are so manipulative.\n\nfirst you are totally healthy to leave the house and stay in the hotel room. but you dont feel medically safe to be at home and he has to ???catch an emergency flight home. i smell dramatique queen here. \n\ni hope he breaks up with you. its incredible. do you not work or do anything and just lounge around at home? please reassess your relationship and let your partner find someone better", "YTA from what you have said about your illness it sounds as though you shouldn\u2019t be going to theme parks anyway and wouldn\u2019t be able to participate in the activities they plan on doing. This would mean they either couldn\u2019t do them, or you would be left out constantly on the holiday. They are probably not including you because they know you can\u2019t come anyway. Also, is your boyfriend suppose to stay at home with you 24/7 incase you need to go to the hospital? Seems a bit unfair to him. I know it sucks not being able to do the things you want to do, but that\u2019s something you are going to have to get use to with your illness.", "YTA. They have let you live with them for 2 years. How is that not enough of an indication of their affection for you? It doesn\u2019t make them AHs to want to do something with their family\u2014or for them to not consider you officially family until you are married. When are you getting married? It\u2019s pretty normal for them to want a family of origin trip before the wedding.\n\nAnd you have health issues that make it dangerous to be home alone but you want to traipse around Disney?

If him and his family can\u2019t even have 4 days to themselves after being there for you all this time it\u2019s the other people in your life you should be questioning, especially your own family.

It's simple, don't go where you are not wanted. This won't fix the problem by insisting. There is more to this than what is explained here. POTS can be treated, and you can learn to see the signs or even get a dog trained to help with this. But such things take time. Either address this head on and take the consequences or give them time and don't go where you are not wanted.", "Is there somewhere else you can stay during that time?\n\n  Leave the pets that aren't yours to be sorted out by this family who obviously don't count you as family.  \n\nI'm wondering whether someone has said that you don't want to go and would be happy staying at home.", "Eesh, did you ask why you weren't invited? \n\nAre there other SOs invited on this trip?\n\nFinally, why are you so bent out of shape that you can't be left home alone by yourself, because it's dangerous,  that is your issue, not theirs to figure out. \n\nMy guess they could he getting tired of you being around.\n\nPull up your big girl panties and figure out how to deal with it.", "It sounds like it would be dangerous for you to fly, walk, go on rides, walk, etc. Needless to say you shouldn\u2019t travel.

Why would you make him miss out on time with his family? If it\u2019s so dangerous for you to be alone what do you do while he\u2019s working?

I honestly hope there is a remedy for what you\u2019re going through medically. Medical issues can have a profound effect on mental health too.

It doesn\u2019t make him a bad person to want to go on a short vacation with his family. \n\nYou\u2019ve experienced a trauma, passing out and being in the ER is traumatic, being diagnosed with a dangerous illness is traumatic, it sounds like your entire way of life is different now with your POTS diagnosis, so I can understand why you want your fianc\u00e9 to be close because he\u2019s probably one of the only things in your life that hasn\u2019t radically changed. But the thing is, even though you are now disabled, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have control over your life. \n\nFrom the comments you\u2019ve left it seems like everytime someone offers a good suggestion you turn it down: you can\u2019t stay with family because their six hours away, the one friend you have in the area doesn\u2019t drive, you\u2019re too ill to care for the dogs by yourself, etc etc. The thing is, you\u2019re trapping yourself.

As a parent of three boys, one of whom is now married I can tell you that if I was planning a family trip where I was paying for food and hotel, I wouldn\u2019t have invited girlfriends. ( If you don\u2019t have a ring and a date- you are a girlfriend.) my other boys want to spend time with their brother. ( Not his girlfriend. They like her alright but really they just want him.) So that\u2019s the reality. Having to pay for an extra hotel room adds a few thousand dollars to a trip that they may or may not want to pay. All of things add up to the fact that it\u2019s their family trip and they get to invite who they want and schedule it how they want. This doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with you- it has a lot to with their kids. \n\nBut now you\u2019ve made it about you, which isn\u2019t good. Your fianc\u00e9 is in a hard spot and you are being a little overly dramatic. \n\nHow long have you not been working? Being in their home for two years is not good.

After reading most of the comments, OP's and others. I feel like OP's concern is being home alone. Not being in a hotel alone, it's the same thing imo.  \nMy guess, just from OP's comments is that since the POTS is extremely new, she has no set plan of treatment. No relief as of yet and no support system except Fianc\u00e9's family.  \n\n\nThey have every right to get a break, including Fianc\u00e9. All the passive aggressive comments just make me think that said Fianc\u00e9 would naturally be called back to hotel from enjoying a day at Disney several times. If your health is that precarious then going anywhere is not a good idea. I understand it's all new to you, but eventually you will have treatments and be in a better place to go and do whatever you want, but right now, you need to let them have a break. All of them. I am disabled so I know what you are going through. It's not fun. Not fun to feel like a burden to your loved ones and it's never fun to not know how you are going to feel just trying to get up.   \nThat being said, give yourself a break as well. Find someone to help with the animals and rest.  \nI would say a very soft gentle yta", "Instead of venting on the matter, have you taken a proactive approach & openly talk to the family on the reasons you\u2019d be safe to go?

Accept their reasons out of respect and politeness because they have been helping support you. \n\nFirst start with your fianc\u00e9. He should have been having your back on this to begin with, and he likely knows the reasons the family has for not inviting you already. \n\nBut honestly, (and really keep this in mind for everything), you\u2019ve living in their house for 2 years now. While this may feel like a stab to you and feel as if they are implying you\u2019re not family, they may legit just want this to be one of their last family trips, with just the original members because it\u2019s their dream from childhood. \nBut whatever reason it is, accept it. Don\u2019t fight them on it, no one wants to be forced into doing something. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t go your way, prove to the house you can be autonomous and responsible for yourself by finding somewhere to stay with someone that cares for you.

But from a 3rd guy's point of view I would suggest that:\n1. They had already discussed between themselves well before telling you and whatever reason/s they came up your fiance agreed.\n\n2. His family has in all probability started putting pressure on him not to go thru with marriage. Your disability maybe a deal breaker for your fiance and he may just not have told you. Just saying it's a possibility, nothing more.\n\n3. Book your own holiday somewhere where you do have family/friends during the same time maybe for 5 days or more. Give them time to organise pet sitters.\n\n4. Go away, clear your head and realistically think about all the risks/ benefits you are facing in this relationship. Think clearly with an open mind, like you would play chess, leaving emotions out as you're planning survival mode. Obviously don't divulge this part. You're just taking a holiday.\n\n5.

On one hand you're not married and even though you are engaged you're still not technically family.  You also have the fact that you are disabled with health conditions that make being alone dangerous for you. My question is: are you planning to go stay with your family during their family trip? Are there going to be people checking up on you to make sure you're okay? And who says you're responsible for his brother's pets? Him the fiance? Because to me, even though you are not entitled to go on the trip and it is shitty that they are excluding you that doesn't make you free Doggy Daycare for people who don't consider you family enough to go on a family trip. \n\nI would politely tell your fiance that his brother can find someone else to dog sit because you need to make accommodations for yourself during the time that he is gone so that you are safe and don't know if the people who will be helping you will be able to assist with dog sitting for his brother's animals. \n\nIf they get mad just tell them flat out I'm not family enough to go on a trip with you guys and quite frankly since you don't care about my personal safety I don't see a reason to go out of my way to accommodate your personal family trip. \n\nI also want to point out that if this is how your fiance is treating you I would be very prepared for down the road that he is not going to take your disability into consideration for any future events or issues. And because his family is doing something fun that he will always think about his own personal selfish wants above your legitimate needs.", "I really can\u2019t pick so a conflicted NTA it is.\n\nOn a separate issue - POTS is pretty common. I have it (and quite severely, too). It\u2019s manageable and safe for you to be home alone. I\u2019m unsure where you got the idea that you can\u2019t be alone safely. I\u2019d suggest switching cardiologists.\n\n1. The most important thing is to hydrate. You need to drink at least 2 liters of water a day. I strongly suggest adding electrolyte powder to your water. It makes a world of difference. You might ask to be put on a water pill to help you retain better.\n\n2. Don\u2019t bend forward, squat down instead. The act of standing from a squat helps move your blood better. No matter what, stand slowly.\n\n3. Getting up from a lying down position should be done slowly. First sit up and don\u2019t move for at least 30 seconds. Slowly stand but don\u2019t take steps yet. After that 3 second wait before the dizziness hits and passes then take a few slow steps.\n\n4. Sit down if your HR gets too high and drink water. Your heart itself, unless you have separate heart problems as many of us do, is fine. You have a volume regulation issue not a heart issue. Remind yourself of that to keep panic at bay or calling an ambulance. POTS is *not* life-threatening.\n\nEdit:  I might be changing to Y T A. I mean wanting to be included is reasonable so feeling left out makes you N T A. I\u2019m torn on this one. I think I\u2019m biased because POTS *is* manageable and I get super irritated when people make it seem life-or-death. You can be left alone. You will not die from POTS. At the same time, I\u2019m disabled (many times over) and I never want to shit on anyone else\u2019s disability. Invisible disabilities can be serious and require grace from others.  It seems like you\u2019re using your POTS as a crutch/for attention? Or are you just *that* afraid of it?  If it\u2019s the former, cut that shit out because it makes people with invisible disabilities have a harder time being taken seriously. If it\u2019s the latter, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there, including tons of us with POTS, and other cardiologists. Getting worked up about it does not serve you and only makes you panic, which makes your HR increase. Tell yourself that you\u2019re fine, your heart is fine, do some grounding, lie down, drink water, tell yourself again that you\u2019re fine and that your heart is fine. Control your breathing. Your HR will lower. No, you can\u2019t do all of the physical activities you used to and that sucks. But you can be alone ffs.", "Yeahhh. YTA.

Other siblings? If so, what are their genders/ages? Do any of them have partners who are or are not going? Are they staying at a Disney hotel or offsite? Asking all this because one of the only reasons I could kind of see for excluding you is a room situation - hotel rooms around Disney aren\u2019t cheap, but Disney hotels are another story altogether, and if another room would need to be booked (whether just for numbers or awkwardness), that could get insanely expensive regardless of who\u2019s paying.\n\nYou\u2019ve been with him for a long time; what have trips looked like in the past?

Disney is happy to make accommodations, you aren\u2019t bringing any problems they don\u2019t already see ten times a day.

In the final month, I would almost pass out daily while driving to work, and when I'd get there, I'd have to lay on the floor for a while before I could stand and start working. After about a week of that, I stopped working because I was terrified I was going to cause an accident. I was basically on bedrest then because I'd get so light-headed and dizzy I pretty much had to be flat. My blood pressure has always been low too, and my heart races. Is the doctor you're seeing a POTS specialist or dysautonomia specialist? I ask because even though POTS is starting to get more notice these days, the majority of doctors don't understand it, don't know how to test for it, and don't know how to treat it. \n\nSome people are able to improve their symptoms with exercise, and doctors often recommend graded exercise therapy for dysautonomia patients. It seems like that might be a good fit for you since you had improvement before when you were running. Though you should probably have a work up before trying something like that to make sure that you don't have any comorbidities that don't respond well to graded exercise therapy. I'm not sure if you've looked into testing yet, but the Tilt table test is the gold standard for diagnosing POTS. Mine was done by a neurologist, but most of my care is done through an Electrophysiology clinic (they're a special kind of Cardiologist) and it is usually a good idea to get a heart workup too, to rule out the racing heart being from an actual heart problem. And to find out if your heart races all the time or just when you change positions (cuz that's not technically POTS, it's a different form of dysautonomia called Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia but is treated in pretty much the same way). I'm bringing this up, because finding these types of doctors is generally difficult and so they have wait lists that go out for months (it took me 6 months to get in to 1 and 9 months for the other), so the sooner you learn who you need to see, the sooner you can find them, get an appointment and be seen. If you already knew all that, then just ignore me.

Get a carer for these 4 days and be independent", "It was unclear to me if you were agreeing with me or disagreeing with me, so I thought I'd take a more neutral approach by responding with the laundry list of things which isn't attacking you if you were agreeing with me, and is educational for everyone. I do appreciate that this post is bringing visibility,  but I don't want the takeaway to be that POTS isn't a big deal and people just need to be careful standing up and they're good to go. \n\nBecause I DO think that the other person was dismissing it as only being careful when you stand up. Also while it's technically non-life-threatening if it is poorly controlled and you pass out it is possible to hit your head on a counter or table or statue or even the floor wrong and get a head wound that could kill you or suffer other injuries like broken bones. And it sounds like OP is newly diagnosed. It sounds like you've been living with it a long time and are pretty stable with the treatment plan you've been using, but if you think back to when this started for you and how scary and overwhelming it was and all the trial and error figuring out what worked for you and what didn't, that's where OP is right now in her journey. So for people to dismiss her valid fears and concerns makes me grouchy. I didn't like it when it happened to me (and still does sometimes unfortunately) and I don't like it happening to someone else.  \n\nI'm also really glad that you found a treatment plan that works for you and that you seem to be doing well! :)", "That's what SHE claims. I actually doubt that. At least the fiance must have given her THE OBVIOUS REASON or maybe other reasons that she simply doesn't like. She sounds like she is trashing the fam that has been taking care of her for 2 years because she was told no for once.", "If she can't be alone, how is being alone far from home better?", "I regret it's a very straightforward assumption based on all your comments here, sorry. And looks like it's the opinion of most of us.\n\nYou requested a jugement you got one. Apply cold water if needed.", "Probably the parents are just tolerating her as much as they're required to. The son is marrying someone he's been with since high school at age 23, and that person is too severely disabled to be left alone for 4 days.", "Board the pets.  POTS can go to parents.  4 boys & parents can have one last relaxing bonding family vacation before 23 year old son commits to marriage.", "No, you're not being specific with any of this. By being mean, I mean like in the sense of them leaving you out of a \"family\" vacation. \n\nAlso neither of you have a home? You'll be living with his family full time even after you're married?", "I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re experiencing vitriol, please know that most disabled people don\u2019t see it as a competition and will not ask you to prove that you\u2019ve suffered enough to be in this fun little club of \u2018bodies that don\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to\u2019 that none of us asked to be in.", "I understand the pet issue. I don\u2019t understand why she should be invited on the trip. She is not yet their sons wife and they may want to be having a holiday with their children. They have taken her in (for a discounted rent) and she has not mentioned anything that suggests she is mistreated at home. Her fianc\u00e9 is the only one that would have any potential obligation to her but he is still entitled to take a trip with his parents and siblings.", "Was about to ask the same thing. + why is traveling to Fl ok, but family 6 hrs away is presented like a great distance?", "Rover. My family is just a separate issue", "She is codependent \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Did you read where she said she can't take Uber because the risk of rape is high?", "It's still a dick move to exclude someone who has been atound for 7 years and lived in the same house for 2 years. My now-MIL took me on holiday for the first time when my partner and I were together for less than a year and I didn't even have to pay the full price because I was a poor university student. It's just decency to welcome the partner of your child into the family. Especially after 7 fucking years.", "Is $500 a month not an acceptable amount, assuming her fiance pays the same amount, to a house that is possibly already paid for/no mortgage? It's a 7 year relationship and they don't consider her family, it's literally that simple. They just decided she would look after all of the pets. She isn't even saying she expects to go, but that she's upset she wasn't even asked.", "Yup. Yikes.", "She is the one who said it\u2019s discounted. I don\u2019t know what the expected costs in her area would typically be. \n\nMaybe they wanted a holiday without having to accomodate her. They are entitled to that."]}
