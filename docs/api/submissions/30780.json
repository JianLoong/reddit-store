Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can\u2019t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that\u2019s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 \u201ccourses\u201d but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.\n\nMy husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too. \n\nThis afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, \u201ccan we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She\u2019s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It\u2019s rude\u201d\n\nAnother person replied, \u201cat least last year she made an actual meal. I\u2019m mad I even brought a gift\u201d\n\nI sent \u201cwtf?\u201d back and the whole chat has been silent since. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don\u2019t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also\u2026 if I\u2019m making people feel like they\u2019re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that\u2019s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they\u2019re right.", "created_utc": 1699729025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t12vr/aita_for_not_serving_a_full_meal_at_my_birthday/", "score": 2378, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were actual friends, they would have had a conversation about how \"you are like this every year\" rather than just shit talk you behind your back.\n\nGoing forward, with a new group of friends, if you do something not \"main stream\", I would say, hey I'm fascinated by the idea of XYZ.

You hosted a party for yourself and invited your friends, you \"forced\" no one to participate, they could have said no. \n\nSounds like the food was a lot of effort. I am eating my dinner now and it was probably like 10 bites total so if you served 15 things, and some or all were multiple bites, I imagine that was plenty of food. \n\nNTA at all. It sucks when you hear what your friends say behind your backs. They owe you an apology.

There's nothing wrong with niche activities, but maybe save them for you and your husband (unless the members of the friend group express an active interest in those niche activities) and make socializing the goal of your party. \n\nThey should've told you to your face, but on the bright side now you have an excuse to make new friends?", "Yes its weird.  It started with molecular food.  Who talks like that.  Just say, snacks for food tasting provided, feel free to bring a snack on the invite.\n\nThere its said in the front what the expectation is. The person who said they shouldnt have brought a gift isnt a friend and misses the point of a gift", "NAH.  I think whether we commenters find the party idea compelling or not isn't really the point.  You threw a party that wasn't as fun for them as you thought it would be.  Not everyone wants the same things, and navigating that is part of having a social life.\n\nI'm sure you would have liked if they enjoyed your birthday party more, but they also had expectations for a night out that weren't met.

But these are the sorts of things that aren't anyone's \"fault\"; just mismatched expectations.\n\nYes, it is shitty that they were careless and you heard their negative reaction to your party, but once you get past the initial sting, it doesn't seem super malicious: if they didn't like your party, they didn't like your party.  They're entitled to their feelings.  What do you want them to do if they didn't like it?  I think we all get annoyed with our friends from time to time.\n\nI realize this is a super weird take, but: the fact that they didn't like it and tried (albeit unsuccessfully) not to let you know probably means that they like you enough to care about your feelings and for you to have a happy birthday and to indulge you from time to time.  They didn't like whatever you did last year--but nonetheless sucked it up to do it again for you this year!  They tried for you, and that matters more in friendship than similar taste in parties.\n\nYes, it was stupid and shitty and clumsy of them that you accidentally saw their grumbling about your party, but realistically, honestly friendship means begrudgingly doing a lot of shit for other people.  I don't think this is the red flag about your friends that some in the comments here are making it out to be.   Without any other evidence to suggest they're bad people, this seems like just grumbling and complaining.", "Idk\u2026 if friends are still expected to bring gifts to a 29th birthday party, that\u2019s a bit much.\n\nOnce I turned like 23 you\u2019d bring alc to their house for the pregame or party but that was all that was expected. And you\u2019d usually get to drink it then and there, with the host getting the leftovers. \n\nOnce I got to be 27 or so you might bring a gift wine instead, but it was still normal to bring the party-alc.\n\nDo you all do this for each birthday? Or is it expected for yours since you have your party at home, and not for theirs since they all have theirs out?\n\nI would say this is one of those moments where you find you\u2019ve grown apart, or you all discuss like adults and maturely change the status quo (which likely won\u2019t be in your favor)", "It sounds like there are other things at play and maybe you don't have the self awareness that maybe you think you do. From what you described, you are not an asshole, but clearly there is somethings else going on or \"she always does this\" would not have happened. \n\nMy guess is you're a bit high maintenance but you think you're casual and you have no idea.

So what did you do last year?\n\nTalking behind your back sucks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue to have smaller group chats in a friend group this size.

I am sorry you had to overhear that, I would also be very hurt. \n\nThat said, I think there's a whole lot of missing context about how you two operate within in your friendship group and that conversation made it pretty clear they think you are out of step with the rest of them. Their exasperation with you was clear.\n\nI love the idea of what you did but I think you should have provided a full meal over a longer evening rather than effectively just a cocktail party when your group typically shares a restaurant meal for birthday celebrations. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't necessarily leap to the conclusion that there is another group chat specifically set up to exclude you. It could just have been a 1-1 conversation between those two people. I use Whatsapp and I quite often send the wrong message to a person or group because I'm having two conversations at once and click on the wrong one. However, I'm old and learnt early on never to put in writing anything I wouldn't want overheard by the world and its maiden aunt so I've stayed out of this kind of trouble. \n\nIn your situation I might reach out to the third couple to ask if they also felt you'd got the event horribly wrong. They would at least be more tactful in sharing their disappointment. Objectively, though, I really can't see anything wrong with their frankness in what was supposed to be a private conversation. It was ungracious but, to be fair, reciprocity is an important feature of adult relationships. \n\nI'd probably be gracious and express sincere sadness for disappointing them and say something like \"in hindsight, we should have planned a more comprehensive evening, and perhaps not on a birthday since we have now realised that we are out of step with the rest of the group for birthday celebrations\". Then see whether they are good enough friends to go into their own apologies and reassurances. If they don't you will know they are done.\n\nHowever, I am surprised the two disgruntled friends haven't already made a group apology because their mistake has made it awkward for the other four people at your event. So that's telling in itself. Don't they care enough to make amends?\n\nFina thought: You guys are obviously foodies so it might be time for you to extend your friendship base towards like-minded people!", "This is what happens when couples friend groups happen, there\u2019s probably a few diff group chats you don\u2019t know about to shit talk other people in the group", "Info...what time of day was this hosted and did the invitation state it would only be light refreshment?", "I love parties like that.

Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can\u2019t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that\u2019s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 \u201ccourses\u201d but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.\n\nMy husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too. \n\nThis afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, \u201ccan we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She\u2019s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It\u2019s rude\u201d\n\nAnother person replied, \u201cat least last year she made an actual meal. I\u2019m mad I even brought a gift\u201d\n\nI sent \u201cwtf?\u201d back and the whole chat has been silent since. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don\u2019t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also\u2026 if I\u2019m making people feel like they\u2019re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that\u2019s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they\u2019re right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As well, I've survived an eating disorder; one of my residual weird hang ups is about small and limited portions. I can work with my own brain pretty well--but I need time to emotionally prep for the ED demon to be adding a running commentary.  \nWhile I'm certain what OP planned was fantastically fun, it would be one of my worst nightmares.

Small is obviously relative, but unless OP specified the whole thing adding up to a snack I'd be expecting that the tastings would add up to roughly a meal.

Or what you want to serve?\n\nPersonally I love trying new food and a tasting event sounds like my cup of tea, but I propose that ops friends didn't get it and that might be why.", "And if we can interpret it differently after the event with extra info, then I'm guessing OPs friends could too.\n\nIf food is involved, then I think at least a few people will expect to have a filling experience.\n\nIm not blaming op, and op doesn't need to manage anything, but a suggestion to prevent this, would be to explain what a tasting event is.", ">But it kinda sounds like this is a bigger deal to OP\u2019s friends than it would be to me personally.

I'd probably grumble (silently, to myself, like a normal person) on my way to get a slice of pizza after the party, but I wouldn't actually be annoyed at OP.\n\nI am curious to know what the friends meant by OP does this often. Does she just like to do birthday parties that aren't strictly restaurant meals and this is somehow weird to the friends, or is it more serving food that's outside the other's comfort zones? Neither would change my vote, but if the friends have very basic palates I can see resentment building up if every year OP is serving things that they're not into. Obviously its on the friends to speak up if they're not comfortable with something, but navigating people's tastes can be hard!", "Agreed. But if multiple are sick of your shit and they\u2019re all talking about you, then maybe you\u2019ve done a lot of things other than putting on a bougie \u201cgastronomic experience\u201d.
