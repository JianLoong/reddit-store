Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can\u2019t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that\u2019s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 \u201ccourses\u201d but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.\n\nMy husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too. \n\nThis afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, \u201ccan we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She\u2019s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It\u2019s rude\u201d\n\nAnother person replied, \u201cat least last year she made an actual meal. I\u2019m mad I even brought a gift\u201d\n\nI sent \u201cwtf?\u201d back and the whole chat has been silent since. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don\u2019t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also\u2026 if I\u2019m making people feel like they\u2019re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that\u2019s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they\u2019re right.", "created_utc": 1699729025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t12vr/aita_for_not_serving_a_full_meal_at_my_birthday/", "score": 5394, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they were actual friends, they would have had a conversation about how \"you are like this every year\" rather than just shit talk you behind your back.\n\nGoing forward, with a new group of friends, if you do something not \"main stream\", I would say, hey I'm fascinated by the idea of XYZ.

You hosted a party for yourself and invited your friends, you \"forced\" no one to participate, they could have said no. \n\nSounds like the food was a lot of effort. I am eating my dinner now and it was probably like 10 bites total so if you served 15 things, and some or all were multiple bites, I imagine that was plenty of food. \n\nNTA at all. It sucks when you hear what your friends say behind your backs. They owe you an apology.

There's nothing wrong with niche activities, but maybe save them for you and your husband (unless the members of the friend group express an active interest in those niche activities) and make socializing the goal of your party. \n\nThey should've told you to your face, but on the bright side now you have an excuse to make new friends?", "Yes its weird.  It started with molecular food.  Who talks like that.  Just say, snacks for food tasting provided, feel free to bring a snack on the invite.\n\nThere its said in the front what the expectation is. The person who said they shouldnt have brought a gift isnt a friend and misses the point of a gift", "NAH.  I think whether we commenters find the party idea compelling or not isn't really the point.  You threw a party that wasn't as fun for them as you thought it would be.  Not everyone wants the same things, and navigating that is part of having a social life.\n\nI'm sure you would have liked if they enjoyed your birthday party more, but they also had expectations for a night out that weren't met.

But these are the sorts of things that aren't anyone's \"fault\"; just mismatched expectations.\n\nYes, it is shitty that they were careless and you heard their negative reaction to your party, but once you get past the initial sting, it doesn't seem super malicious: if they didn't like your party, they didn't like your party.  They're entitled to their feelings.  What do you want them to do if they didn't like it?  I think we all get annoyed with our friends from time to time.\n\nI realize this is a super weird take, but: the fact that they didn't like it and tried (albeit unsuccessfully) not to let you know probably means that they like you enough to care about your feelings and for you to have a happy birthday and to indulge you from time to time.  They didn't like whatever you did last year--but nonetheless sucked it up to do it again for you this year!  They tried for you, and that matters more in friendship than similar taste in parties.\n\nYes, it was stupid and shitty and clumsy of them that you accidentally saw their grumbling about your party, but realistically, honestly friendship means begrudgingly doing a lot of shit for other people.  I don't think this is the red flag about your friends that some in the comments here are making it out to be.   Without any other evidence to suggest they're bad people, this seems like just grumbling and complaining.", "Idk\u2026 if friends are still expected to bring gifts to a 29th birthday party, that\u2019s a bit much.\n\nOnce I turned like 23 you\u2019d bring alc to their house for the pregame or party but that was all that was expected. And you\u2019d usually get to drink it then and there, with the host getting the leftovers. \n\nOnce I got to be 27 or so you might bring a gift wine instead, but it was still normal to bring the party-alc.\n\nDo you all do this for each birthday? Or is it expected for yours since you have your party at home, and not for theirs since they all have theirs out?\n\nI would say this is one of those moments where you find you\u2019ve grown apart, or you all discuss like adults and maturely change the status quo (which likely won\u2019t be in your favor)", "It sounds like there are other things at play and maybe you don't have the self awareness that maybe you think you do. From what you described, you are not an asshole, but clearly there is somethings else going on or \"she always does this\" would not have happened. \n\nMy guess is you're a bit high maintenance but you think you're casual and you have no idea.

I am sorry you had to overhear that, I would also be very hurt. \n\nThat said, I think there's a whole lot of missing context about how you two operate within in your friendship group and that conversation made it pretty clear they think you are out of step with the rest of them. Their exasperation with you was clear.\n\nI love the idea of what you did but I think you should have provided a full meal over a longer evening rather than effectively just a cocktail party when your group typically shares a restaurant meal for birthday celebrations. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't necessarily leap to the conclusion that there is another group chat specifically set up to exclude you. It could just have been a 1-1 conversation between those two people. I use Whatsapp and I quite often send the wrong message to a person or group because I'm having two conversations at once and click on the wrong one. However, I'm old and learnt early on never to put in writing anything I wouldn't want overheard by the world and its maiden aunt so I've stayed out of this kind of trouble. \n\nIn your situation I might reach out to the third couple to ask if they also felt you'd got the event horribly wrong. They would at least be more tactful in sharing their disappointment. Objectively, though, I really can't see anything wrong with their frankness in what was supposed to be a private conversation. It was ungracious but, to be fair, reciprocity is an important feature of adult relationships. \n\nI'd probably be gracious and express sincere sadness for disappointing them and say something like \"in hindsight, we should have planned a more comprehensive evening, and perhaps not on a birthday since we have now realised that we are out of step with the rest of the group for birthday celebrations\". Then see whether they are good enough friends to go into their own apologies and reassurances. If they don't you will know they are done.\n\nHowever, I am surprised the two disgruntled friends haven't already made a group apology because their mistake has made it awkward for the other four people at your event. So that's telling in itself. Don't they care enough to make amends?\n\nFina thought: You guys are obviously foodies so it might be time for you to extend your friendship base towards like-minded people!", "This is what happens when couples friend groups happen, there\u2019s probably a few diff group chats you don\u2019t know about to shit talk other people in the group", "Info...what time of day was this hosted and did the invitation state it would only be light refreshment?", "I love parties like that.

Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can\u2019t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that\u2019s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 \u201ccourses\u201d but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.\n\nMy husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too. \n\nThis afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, \u201ccan we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She\u2019s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It\u2019s rude\u201d\n\nAnother person replied, \u201cat least last year she made an actual meal. I\u2019m mad I even brought a gift\u201d\n\nI sent \u201cwtf?\u201d back and the whole chat has been silent since. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don\u2019t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also\u2026 if I\u2019m making people feel like they\u2019re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that\u2019s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they\u2019re right.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am a picky eater and super weird about textures. I would never have eaten anything you served but I also would have been polite enough to sit through this weirdness and just grabbed some fast food afterwards and never would have said anything negative about you.

Didn\u2019t even involve myself in the fight as it was a busy week\u2026but I read thru it a few days later and liked a few things\u2026and she didn\u2019t like it. I was unfriended for a few months and then she friend requested me again. This happens fairly regularly. \ud83d\ude44", "I mute the whats app for my son\u2019s class.  Folks need hobbies.

However, 20 tablespoons of food, plus other snacks, is more than acceptable party fare, even if it's being served at dinner time.\n\nA birthday party is also not a meal by default.

Having a Super Bowl Larry type appetizer spread is different than having a little Chex mix and some vegetables. Or something like that.", "In my friend group it\u2019s normal to the point of being expected to serve food if the party is around meal time and because people eat at different times this means even late night parties will specifically outline if snacks are served, if it\u2019s byob, if people are encouraged to bring food, etc. \n\nIt sounds like OP did give enough of a heads up and the timeline of the party wasn\u2019t a problem, but yeah if I was invited to a party at 5pm that went late into the night and I was told there would be food but it ended up being just snacks and cocktails?

You are no friend of that person!", "You're kidding! \n\nThey were downright snarky! And if you want to complain to a friend about a friend, you don't do it in a group chat FGS!

Seriously?

And as it seems op has a history of being \"weird\" and cooking her birthday meal for her friends, then I am *pretty sure* op is aware of their dietary restrictions or, failing that, would not hold them down and force the *molecular pairings* down their friends throat. \n\nSo.. it isn't that difficult!

No main course. It's like... hummus, veggies, cheese, crackers, some deli meats, we all pronounce prosciutto and bruschetta wrong because one friend grew up bilingual with her emigrated from Italy chef dad and we all say it wrong to annoy her. Bonus points if nothing remotely resembles bruschetta. At some point she'll break and tell us, again, we're all saying it wrong.\n\nWe eat our snacks throughout the night and play One Night Werewolf and have a terrible dance party and sometimes people sleep on a dog bed. At some point, we may get drunk and make dino nuggies.\n\nIt's just sort of what we do. No cooking a big meal, because it requires cleaning up a whole meal. We have chips and chex mix and pretend we're fancy adults with salami and water crackers as we play flip cup.\n\nNobody has ever bitched about snack parties. We all do it. So much cheaper than going out for dinner, and you can play flip cup and laugh at the one person who cuddled the dog on a dog bed and fell asleep there. What restaurant allows Secret Hitler? None.\n\nBut it sure is fun.", "Hosts generally let their guests know what the food situation will be. It\u2019s basic etiquete.", "That\u2019s literally what they\u2019re saying. My god he vitriol in your response for something they\u2019re basically agreeing with you on is ridiculous. People seriously just come here to be rude at this point. \n\nAll the person you\u2019re replying to with such anger was saying is that it\u2019s common courtesy to give people a heads up about the kind of night that\u2019s going to happen. At NO point did they say someone was obligated to feed them how you ever jumped to that conclusion is beyond me. \n\nSomeone hosting a party should let people know what kind of night it\u2019ll be. That\u2019s really simple stuff. For example if you\u2019re going to have a micro tasting party with 15 courses but the portions will be quite small explain that to your invitees so they can do exactly what you\u2019re yelling about and be \u201cadults\u201d and eat a little extra before they show up. \n\nI\u2019ve learnt that if someone has a party or event where food will be involved to clarify if it\u2019ll be enough food to actually count as a meal or if it\u2019ll be more of a tasting/appetizer thing but not everyone thinks of that. I\u2019ve learnt my lesson though after ending up completely starving at more than one event to the point where I just wanted to leave. \n\nExpecting people to be mind readers and somehow figure out what you have planned so they can prepare accordingly is selfish. We don\u2019t know what exactly her invite included though and whether she provided her guests with that kind of heads up. Either way it\u2019s irrelevant because they acted like assholes talking shit about her in a group text like that. If I went to an event and didn\u2019t get a heads up and ended up starving I\u2019d just have to leave early and go get food. I wouldn\u2019t stay there all night pretending to have a good time and then talk shit about them the next day.", "Some people are. I'm required to eat at 6 hour intervals outside of sleeping hours. I'm not in a wheelchair but I have enough nerve damage and paralysis that I have to eat on a schedule. Diabetics have similar needs. Your comment just shows that you lack empathy and consideration. If op advertised it openly as to what was going to happen, then those people are petty assholes. If op scheduled the event in a way that conflicts with dinner times like dude above is saying 4pm-11pm and they were expecting dinner and got some weird sampler, op would be the asshole for not having adequate food for the party.", "Well, if I eat beforehand, I\u2019m not eating whatever she prepared.", "No but why would I assume you wouldn\u2019t have a meal at mealtime for a longgggg party? Lol", "Most people wouldn't want to invite their friends to things they wouldn't enjoy, or purposefully drag them along for their own personal satisfaction, even on their birthday. At least, nobody I'm friends with acts that way. I invite people to things I think they will enjoy too, so that we can enjoy it together. If it isn't shared, I would rather do it alone than demand I have a forced audience for my own entertainment.", "Right, and if someone had swooped in to apologize and explain, it might be different. I think we all kvetch behind each other's backs from time to time, but this just seems mean-spirited in the face of a lot of effort on the part of the OP.", "Really! Interesting. Idk man\u2026 I love a lot of weird things.\n\nWhat I\u2019m imagining for molecular pairings is a strawberry and one peppercorn, or a bite of mashed potato with grape jelly in the middle, or a\u2026 puddle of soy sauce and a small pile of ears of corn. I feel like I probably would not love the \u201cdishes\u201d, but I would love the experience and comparing them and talking about them. \n\nI\u2019ve never been to one though, so I actually have no idea how I would find the experience to be.", "And even if they were weird and I hated them, I would not text rude things about them to other people! What the hell!\n\n(OP I hope it\u2019s very clear that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re weird or that your friends hate you; I\u2019m just using an extreme example to illustrate how horrible their behavior is)", "I\u2019d go to OPS party!", "You\u2019ve spent a lot comments arguing with people over what I think is a misunderstanding. They think you\u2019re agreeing with the friends while you\u2019re saying something that\u2019s not quite coming across how you want it to. \n\nHaving a birthday is absolutely carte Blanche to do what you want. You\u2019re right on that count. It is however polite to give people a heads up as to what they can expect so they can plan accordingly. That\u2019s all people are saying. \n\nSo using the dinner party micro pairing thing as an example I wouldn\u2019t be pissed about someone doing that. Like you said in a different comment it\u2019s not a Caligula style orgy. BUT I would REALLY have appreciated a heads up because I tend to eat a decent amount of food and there\u2019s no way that what she served would have been enough for me. I\u2019d have NEVER said anything about it to her. I wouldn\u2019t have judged her choice or shit on her parade. What I would have done though was eat something before leaving or on the way to make sure I didn\u2019t end up starving by the end of the night. \n\nThat\u2019s all people are saying. So for example the person with the allergies can find out before hand if they won\u2019t be able to eat a lot of the food and bring something they can eat or eat a little extra before. The guy who can\u2019t eat pork would know whether a lot of the dishes had pork and do likewise. \n\nNo you don\u2019t have to adjust your party how you want to have it for other people but giving them a heads up as to what to expect is common courtesy. Like let\u2019s say she planned to leave home half way through the night and go to a bar. If she tells people that in advance they can bring a change of clothes if needed, or different shoes, or let the baby sitter know it\u2019ll be a late night. That\u2019s all people are saying.\n\nThat being said this point is irrelevant because they were just absolutely nasty in their texts to the group chat and their issues clearly weren\u2019t any of the kind I detailed above. They seem to just not like anything different or particularly even like her much for that matter.", "But see, that\u2019s not even accurate. Queen bees can choose to use their powers for good. The fact of the matter is that these are just nasty people.", "They work in HR.", "Ditto. Also, so far op only knows two ppl though that/agreed with each other. I would much prefer to find out if they ALL thought that and were just too gutless to say so.\n\n\nSeriously, 29yr Olds?!?\u203d Whelp. Age is not an indicator of maturity, unfortunately. \n\n\n\nOp, I would LOVE to attend your parties, if that's what they are like.
