Her parents disowned her for it due to religious reasons but reached out right before my eldest nephew was born. \n\nDespite reaching out years ago, my brother and SIL only set up a date for them to meet my nephews recently. I was babysitting the boys that day and was waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up so I had the \u201cpleasure\u201d of meeting her parents/in laws. \n\nWell idek how it came up, but another thing about my SIL is that she had many miscarriages before giving birth to my nephews. Her mom was talking about god and said that those miscarriages were my SIL\u2019s punishment for giving her so much pain and for marrying my brother. She used my nephews as proof because according to her, my SIL was only able to give birth because her parents had finally forgiven her.\n\nMy brother was with one of the boys in the nursery so he wasn\u2019t present but I was and I was pissed. My SIL bursted into tears and my nephews were about to cry too because their mom was upset. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even trying to be polite so I admit, I yelled at them to get out. They were all like \u201cwho even are you?\u201d but I ignored them and told them if they didn\u2019t leave, I would call the cops. They told me I had no right and I\u2019m clearly not apart of this but I had managed to get them out the front door and shut the door on them mid sentence. My brother heard the commotion and immediately went to his wife so I went out to make sure they left but their car was still there and they started yelling at me about god so I went \u201cfuck you and your god\u201d and said it was all a bunch of bullshit. \n\nThey told me I went too far disrespecting their religion but ultimately left. I didn\u2019t think much of it till my brother called me yesterday asking me what exactly I said to them because apparently they made a Facebook post about religious discrimination and being a minority and we (me mostly) are getting flamed. \n\nI did not mean to discriminate them or anything, but since when was that ever a valid excuse. I\u2019ve been reading the comments and I feel shitty now because I have friends who are apart of this religion and I just feel like a dick. Not for insulting them, but for saying that shit I said about god/their beliefs. Of course these people don\u2019t know the whole story and I don\u2019t regret standing up for my SIL but I feel incredibly guilty for making so many people feel hurt by my words.

You did the right thing imo.", "Amen to that.", "It's not a specific religion telling mothers that they had miscarriages as punishment, it's down to individuals themselves interpreting their particular religion in a very twisted way.
