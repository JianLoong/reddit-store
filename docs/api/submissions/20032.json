We\u2019ve had many family discussions (with the kids) about what polite dinner manners should include. I don\u2019t have them written down in a list or anything, but they include things like (a) use your silverware, (b) no discussions about poop/pee or anything disgusting while people are eating (they\u2019re boys and they find these topics hilarious), (c) if you need to burp\u2026 cover your mouth, turn your head away from the table and say excuse me, (d) chew with your mouth closed, (e) no throwing food. Pretty basic, courteous, conscientious stuff. \n\nKids are constantly pushing boundaries. It can be exhausting for parents to reinforce rules at the dinner table all of the time. But what is the alternative? If you let it slide, they think it\u2019s okay and start to do the \u201cbad\u201d behavior more. The rules are intended to build good social etiquette as opposed to being morally good/bad. \n\nAt dinner tonight, there were several times that I had to say something to the kids regarding polite dinner manners. \n\n(1) The boys were sitting next to each other and were getting goofy, which is fine, but that escalated into them putting food in each others\u2019 faces and they started to get handsy with each other. One of the dinner table rules is \u201ckeep your hands to yourself.\u201d As it was escalating, I asked them to remember their polite dinner manners and keep their hand to themselves. My husband says they\u2019re just being silly and they\u2019re not doing anything wrong, so he totally undermined me. \n\n(2) Later, one of the kids asks about a friend of theirs\u2026 asks if the kid \u201cpees Ranch [dressing] because he likes it so much?\u201d Husband laughs and answers the question with \u201cyes, he pees Ranch.\u201d Again, I ask them to remember their polite dinner manners. Husband undermined me again and this time I call him out on it. \n\n(3) Finally, one kid burps loudly without covering his mouth. Husband says something about polite dinner manners and asks the kid to say excuse me, which he does. \n\nThis \u201cbattle\u201d over the dinner manners happens constantly. First, we agreed to the rules as a family. Second, I am almost always the only onto enforcing the rules. Third, I am regularly being undermined by my husband. \n\nSo, AITA for addressing every breech of the family dinner rules, thus making dinner \u201cstressful\u201d?

One meal and you know you can NEVER go out with them again. I\u2019d imagine they were raised in homes that either didn\u2019t teach or reinforce basic table manners. You have a husband problem. He needs to back you up and help enforce rules. One thing that helped with my kids getting handsy at meals was assigned seats. I made them sit where they\u2019d least likely cause problems and that became their permanent seat. It\u2019s been years and they all still sit in their assigned spots. Table manners is a thing for me too so I\u2019d totally die on this hill.", "NTA. Tell your husband to get his stuff together. You have 2 kids not 3.", "NTA.

You don't want them to feel like they're constantly in the wrong.", "NTA Your rules sound very reasonable. There are some things I would try though. First, talk to your husband about backing you up. Maybe discuss only strictly enforcing the rules at certain meals. Anything goes on Saturday, but on week days they are on their best behavior? I\u2019d also remind him that while letting them do what they want may be relaxing for the kids, it isn\u2019t relaxing for you. I can\u2019t eat if there is talk about bodily fluids are the table. I would not be relaxed. \n\nSecond, have some conversation starters prepared. You can find lots of ideas online. My youngest is 16 and we still do high/low a few times a week. \n\nThird, you can practice table manners outside of meal times. Maybe do a tea party once a month. You can even dress up. Set the table. Use different dishes. Talk in \u201cfancy\u201d voices and go all in -backs straight, no elbows on the table, etc. it\u2019s quicker than dinner, can be at a time where everyone is relaxed, and it\u2019s fun because it\u2019s pretend.", "NTA.  That\u2019s not silly.  That\u2019s failing to teach and model basic social activities.  Your boys and your household have or will surely get the reputation of uncouth animals not fit for sleepovers, birthday parties or any social occasion.

Are there actual consequences for \ud83d\udc94 Ng the rules? Kids love parental attention, so long as you are reacting, and sounds like significantly reacting, to their bad behavior it's just going to reinforce it.  Might I suggest a calm nonverbal consequence?  Like next time a kid screams pee you calmly say ten minutes off video game or TV time or whatever is an age appropriate consequence, then just move on.  It will suck the first few days but if you actually enforce the consequences (assuming no trauma in the kids history) should work.  Parenting is hard as hell and I'm sure you're doing a great job!  Good luck!", "NTA but it does sound like family dinner has become etiquette training and not every night has to be a battle between you and your kids. The first 2 sound more like little boys being little boys and a simple redirect would have been sufficient and probably more effective than making a bid deal of it.", "'Asshole' is a subjective term. So, no. \n\nImo, what you're doing isn't wrong. But it is wholly ineffective if you're constantly being undermined by your husband. You'll probably have to discuss this with him privately and agree on a dinner decorum standard that both of you believe in, and will consistently reinforce as a team. \n\nThis means discussing what the expectations from each of you are, and why that's important to you. Then finding common factors and negotiating uncommon ones without attacking each other's character. \n\nIf you're asking whether kids shouldn't fool around or discuss pee/poo at the dinner table, the answer differs for each person. I'd wholeheartedly participate in such a discussion, but I'd also politely decline if the parents expressed that they'd rather not have that.", "NTA you\u2019re trying your best to teach your kids about basic manners, and being respectful to others at the table. \n\nyou need to talk to your husband on why you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s teaching right now when parenting is partnership, why is he leaving it all to you and kind of making you the villain-parent here?", "NTA but your husband is. I feel horrible for folks who are forced to be the bad cop to their kids all the time bc of a partner that only wants to be the good friend. It\u2019s not fair. Consistency is key and the more your husband undermines you the longer this will drag out. That being said I\u2019m not uncomfortable with the \u201cpeeing ranch\u201d thing. That was funny. I get bc it\u2019s a bodily function but good conversation and laughing also make a meal great.", "NTA teaching them manners, but personally I don't think it needs to be a *constant* thing. They are kids, after all, and young boys tend to gravitate naturally towards burps and roughhousing and such. Constant vigilance won't (and hasn't) made it go away. So loosen up a bit (not entirely!) and as they age they'll likely naturally not want to embarrass themselves as much around others.", "NTA but it does sound unpleasant (for you). Maybe now that you have the basic etiquette down it\u2019s time to shift focus on best vs good behavior in different settings, and that certain things may be ok at home but not out. Either way talk to your husband and get on the same page.", "NTA. If you dont teach them they will be acting feral out in public.grabbing other people's food belching loudly etc \n\nBut rather than continue along the path which really isnt working you need to try another tactic Now they are doing it so you will call them out, apparently they want negative attention.  \n\nI would suggest sitting them down after the next meal and asking them to tell you what they understand the rules to be.  They will likely remember most if not all of them, which confirms they are not slipping up but are doing it intentionally. If they missed any, remind them of those they missed \n\nThen tell them from now on they have to pay you $2 each time they dont follow the rules. Or if they dont have birthday savings.or get an allowance, then you could dock them 1 hr of computer time or tv time, whichever they like the most.\nOr each time they break the rules, then they have to clear away the dishes or load the dishwasher.\n\nYou need to up the ante so they dont  think mealtime is time for inappropriate conversation or actions. And they are old enough it shouldn't be a daily battle.\n\nI think if you create a penalty you will see a vast improvement.\n\nOr if you had rather do positive reinforcement, you could tell them that they will earn X after one week without issues at mealtime. X being something they would be willing to modify their behavior for.  Could be going to see a movie, or maybe they earn $7 (a dollar for each day they behaved at mealtime but they have to do 7 days in a row without issue ), you get the picture.  \n\nThe  issue with earning a reward is that it implies they will continue to receive the reward as long as they behave, which could fet expensive.\n\nSo in this case id prob go with a penalty for misbehaving.", "My mom did home manners and restaurant manners. So in those moments she\u2019d remind us that those were not restaurant manners. I think it helped her just not have to fight every battle and we got to laugh at my dad burping. Idk if that\u2019s helpful or not but imo sometimes it\u2019s good to relax.", "NTA, but I think you undersell how much your husband values being silly with the kids. I may be projecting as I am very pro-silly. Tell your husband he doesn't have to harshly shut that down but just explain the poo/pee was wrong and give an example.

We have \u201cthe pig\u201d. It is a brass pig that fits in your palm, so not easily broken. Any pig will do. The point of the game is not to end up with the pig. Pig faces whoever shows poor manners. Pig continues to face you until someone else is caught showing poor manners then pig faces them. No one is exempt from getting the pig except guests because it\u2019s bad manners to point out a guest\u2019s poor manners. It is not just parents catching kids using poor manners. Kids can catch each other and parents. I thought I had good table manners until the game, but I have gotten caught plenty of times! Husband needs to get on board as he is making the manners worse!

Look, I do think having a sense of good eating manners (especially in a public setting with other diners being impacted) is important for kids and 8 and 10 are ages in which playing with food at the table maybe isn\u2019t the best and could stand to be reinforced as not ok at mealtimes. But everything else? For just having dinner together as a family? That\u2019s too much and you\u2019re doing too much. \n\nMy father was a choirboy, raised on super strict table manners, and he made every mealtime a nightmare for me.

What does your husband plan on doing when your kids get invited to dinner at a friend's house?

Your husband needs to have a long think about the kind of people he's raising and whether or not he wants some grandkids at some point.", "[deleted]", "NTA but also not necessarily doing the right thing. Kids can be difficult and sometimes you might just have to let things go. Your kids will probably still grow up to have good manners, but just realistically it may just be impossible to force them to abide by every rule. As a kid, sometimes you just break rules on purpose and nobody's going to convince you otherwise.\n\nLike, how far are you willing to take the enforcement of rules? It seems like the boys were fighting but they stopped eventually, even though your husband didn't enforce it. Would they have actually learned a better lesson or become more polite if they were yelled at or punished? It's never a straightforward answer. You also don't want them to start dreading family dinner because it's etiquette training hour. Sometimes your husband's reaction of laughing it off can be an actual solution to get them to stop. \n\nThe main problem here is that you aren't on the same page. He shouldn't do that if he agreed to help you enforce the manners rules, but maybe it's time to discuss them again? Because parenting is a very personal and cultural thing there's not really an asshole here, just the need to communicate and find a solution. I personally find the extent of your manners rules quite extreme - I grew up with 3 siblings and we'd do stupid stuff at dinner but now we are adults and extremely polite and well-mannered. The language thing is also very strict to me - piss is not a bad word in my opinion, but again it's subjective. Maybe try talking to them and coming up with a list of words they agree are off limits, so they have some agency in the manner making process.\n\nJust remember that kids doing silly stuff during dinner doesn't directly translate to them becoming rude and unmannered adults.", "Have you just recently started these dinner manners?", "Thank you.

The mixed messages they are getting will prevent them from improving.", "NTA, but I do have a funny anecdote.\n\nMy parents did very well teaching us good table manners and how to be guests in other people\u2019s homes. When we were teenagers though, we were more lax in our manners at home. We\u2019d reach in front of people, talk with our mouths full, etc. I can\u2019t remember if it was my mom or dad, but one of them asked, \u201cAre you like this outside of the house?\u201d And without missing a beat my brother said, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I act this way around people, do you?\u201d", "NTA but it seems you need either more motivation like a good dinner behavior star chart or consequences other than reminding them when they break rules.\n\nI think they should not sit next to each other as one consequence of putting their hands and food on each other.\n\nMaybe if they are somewhat competitive getting stars and possibly rewards might spur them on to better behavior.\n\nI would have a talk with your spouse on how shitty they are to agree to rules and then participate in breaking those rules. He needs to be a parent too.", "I\u2019m going with NTA/NAH. Purely because I wasn\u2019t there and don\u2019t now how tense you were. And because I\u2019m a boys mom too and I feel you... My husband is also stricter than I am.\nAnd luckily have only my youngest beast to worry about \ud83d\ude00. \nMy kids are usually very well behaved and I let some things slide at home. My oldest hates most of the things the little one does (eating with his hands, burping,..)\n\nSome things that might help:\n\n1) Could you loosen up at home but definitely not at a restaurant/ with others around? It works wonders for our kids and they are super well mannered when eating out. \n\n2) I had to let go of the pee/poo talk thing. It\u2019s too exhausting. Luckily they don\u2019t talk about it too often (almost never). \nBurping isn\u2019t that bad either (they don\u2019t seem to find it funny?) but it tends to be less funny when it\u2019s allowed so I don\u2019t bother.\n\n3) the boys are not allowed to sit next to each other or on opposite sides of each other. This way they\u2019re eating in peace. Otherwise they won\u2019t stop bothering each other. The rare occasion when they do sit together, they know very well that there\u2019s no warning: fighting will get them changed places. My husband is even firmer on that one then I am.\n\n4) utensils: maybe you could make some sort of competition? Using the utensils gets you bonus points?\nThis one is harder since my husband and oldest son eat everything with utensils. My youngest eats with his hands and to be completely fair, I myself have to be mindful all the time not to take a tomato or something like that with my hands\u2026 I do try all the time, but it\u2019s some sensory thing I guess\u2026 fries, cheese and uncut fruits/veggies are way more fun and easy to eat without a fork.\n\nGood luck!!", "Your effort should be teaching them good manners without ruining a pleasant time together.\nYou might add different approaches to spelling out the norms\nLike briefly mimicking chewing with your mouth open to signal one boy what he is doing, without interrupting the conversation.\nOr rolling your eyes and sighing in a funny way when some topics are brought up. I would keep it as light as possible.", "Your Husband is the AH, they won't change if he constantly undermines you, you need to be a united front", "NTA I'd talk to husband separately and explain your trying to prepare them for how to behave out in public and he isnt helping by undermining your efforts in front of them", "OP, you didn't say, but was this dinner at home or in public?", "So true, I do not get along with my cousins, so I do not see them very often but when I do it seems to always be at a meal and their manners disgust me.  They are in their 60's and eat like toddlers.  One actually will put her chin on her plate and shovel the food in.", "TBH, it really stinks that your husband is basically forcing you to be the mean parent while he gets to be the fun one talking about pee pee ranch", "Awwww! The good old \u201cboys will be boys\u201d excuse where we accept, and even sometimes valorise, a certain behaviour from a group of kids and not from another based off their genitalia. Probably that very same thinking which leads good old daddy here to believe he doesn\u2019t need to intervene and feels it\u2019s appropriate parenting and partnership to undermine his wife\u2019s interventions.", "8 and 10 are not little boys anymore. If they were three and five these behaviors would, of course not be acceptable, but make sense for their age group. 8 and 10 years old is old enough to be having dinner at people's houses away from Mom and Dad, to be having sleepovers with people, to be going out to dinner with a friend's family. That's old enough to embarrass yourself. If a 3-year-old or a 5-year-old starts grabbing food or belching at the table it's annoying but you can still say that they are learning. An eight or a 10-year-old? That's a quick way to get a reputation.", "If thats how you behaved they probably are not sad about it", "And enforcing it when it suits him so he can say he dooooessss enforce manners what do you meeeeeaann", "They will just do the same things from the opposite side of the table.  One thing that helps is to remember they are still young, and maybe asking them to not goof around at the table is too much right now.  Let them be kids & have some fun at dinner, just not fun that involves bodily functions.", "Or maybe it's because most boys of that age like to talk about pee, poop, facts, etc, and most girls of that age do not. But hey maybe your opinion that just screams \"I've never been around young children in my life\" is correct. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "My thoughts exactly. 8-10 yo arent little any more.    \nGood on OP trying to instil table manners,but it needed to start much younger. By now the kids should have decent table manners- Ok some laughing and joking at the dinner table is allowable as part of conversation,but they shdnt be grabbing,burping etc.  Would help if Dad had been involved in the training,not leaving it all to OP.", "Tell me you don't have kids without saying you don't have kids. 8 and 10 are still little boys. Hell, 18 is a little boy in a lot of ways except legally. If you're more worried about your reputation than letting your kids have a little freedom to be themselves in their own home, do us all a favor and don't reproduce. It's normal for kids to act better in public and away from their parents. The only thing op is teaching them is that she is more worried about their manners than them as individuals.", "I agree; you are absolutely right. They are also racist, nationalist, homophonic, transphobic, bigots.", "And girls. There are 4 girls in my family and we also had to be banned from discussing pee and poop at the dinner table \ud83d\ude02", "I have a 9yo son and I\u2019m a single father. Yes, he likes to talk about poop but I do not allow it at the table. Other times it\u2019s fine and I\u2019ll even joke about it with him but I emphasize that there\u2019s a time and place for that sort of thing.", "They\u2019re just rambunctious young boys who are doing what young boys do.", "And the need for table manners is why you cut them off, good end result but weird line", "There. Thank you. It\u2019s totally normal for a kid to want to talk about bodily functions (and find it funny) at a certain age. It has nothing to do with their genitalia and more so with the social views on such subjects.\n\nSource: I have 7 nephews and nieces and also studied child developmental psychology."]}
