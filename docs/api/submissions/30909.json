Lyrica was the worst one that caused me to gain 30 pounds in 2 months with no diet changes, even though it helped I had to stop because that much weight gain in a short time scared me. Bodies are weird and can do some crazy shit. Society needs to stop looking at a person and putting all the blame on them for being obese. Even it\u2019s because binge eat, they should be respected and helped instead of blaming. Would you blame a person who\u2019s anorexic or bulimic? No because people would blame the mental illness. Yet binge eating is also an eating disorder and should be treated as such also. Which means treating the mental illness that is causing someone to binge. People are quick to help those who are anorexic and bulimic by changing small aspects of daily life, so why not do so for those who have food addiction issues. Let encourage people instead of making the struggle harder.", "I am also morbidly obese. I also have 3 other adults in the house - a husband and adult children.

I mean, how self centred can you get??", "Oh no, there are people in the world who are active, have a healthy lifestyle, and don't eat dietetic food. Yes, in their own parents' kitchen, they eat food that doesn't help dieters lose weight! \n\nI'd tell you how appalled I am by that outrageous fritter of yours, but I'm snickering too hard to type the words coherently.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - so she wants you to create an unhealthy relationship with food to make her happy? Yeah. No. Definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nYou work your ass off to be able to eat the stuff you want to, if she's not happy about you eating whilst visiting your mother then she can go for a walk or stay in her room.", "NTA.  I honestly thought this was going to be a situation where you lived in the same home and you were bringing all kinds of crap into the house.  One time you are there with an apple fritter and latte?  You're just fine.", "Nta", "Definitely NTA!!!!  You've earned that fritter and drink! \n\nI will skip meals all day or maybe only eat like 16 raw almonds throughout the day in order to save up (spare calories) to eat chocolate chip ice cream for dinner.  Calories are like money to me, you're sister is seriously In Debt! and needs to pay back that loan she took. You on the other hand have Earned those treats with all your activity.  Your sister should try to get on your fitness plan, then she can be on the same diet plan.", "If you walk into a room and don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in it, the thing to do is walk out of the room. \n\nNTA", "Don't apologize.  She needs to manage her food issues.  That said, if your mom says don't bring x food, don't.\n\nNta", "NTA. Your sister sounds like she blames everyone else for her problems. What will she do when someone walking past her is eating fast food or ice cream? It's her own will power and it's not your responsibility to police yourself with food bc she is trying to diet. That's absurd and I'd want an apology from her for acting like a lunatic when you came to your parents house and you had a donut. This is so incredibly dumb. I wouldn't apologize to her. She should get her own house if she wants to police what ppl eat around her. 24 going on 14.", "NTA, no sympathy for inflated humans", "NTA. I'm allergic to broccoli but I don't snap at people around me for eating it.", "NTA having self control is half of the challenge (coming from someone who is also trying to lose weight and watch what they eat)", "Jesus I can see why shes fat, what a coddled babby!\n\nNTA - omg", "Nta", "I cannot eat dairy or anything from a cow so I am vegan because it\u2019s just easier that way. I get jealous of people eating pizza in front of me because it\u2019s hard to control myself. But that is my problem. People I love eat pizza in front of me all the time. I can be envious at the same time I\u2019m happy for them. \n\nThis is going to sound blunt and unnecessarily mean but: How is denying you food that you enjoy going to make your sister not fat? It makes no logical sense. It\u2019s not like you brought a box of donuts to taunt her. While you can be supportive of someone\u2019s weight loss journey, ultimately it\u2019s her sole responsibility to control what goes infer body and the level of activity she participates in. \n\nI\u2019d stay away from your family for a while, but not because you did anything wrong. Because you don\u2019t deserve to be the scapegoat. \n\nNTA", "NTA No need to apologise imo.", "Info\n\nDoes your sister have an eating disorder? Strict rules about other people\u2019s food happens with disordered relationships with food", "Apparently the lady shake helps?! It will stop her from being hungry therefore craving foods, or certain foods at least!", "NTA, I feel for her in how hard it can be to radically change your diet / cut junk, but she doesn\u2019t get to hold it against other people who can eat the stuff she is choosing not to eat.", "\"I'M on a diet, so YOU can't have a doughnut.\" Yeah.. good luck with that Fatty.", "I'm sorry, I have to ask.\n\nWas there someone with a weapon present not allowing sister to leave the room or ignore the food she cannot eat?  \n\nI'm guessing if this is sissy's reaction, mom's reaction is because the parents aren't 'allowed' to have such things in their own home because of sissy and that's why she chewed out OP.\n\nNTA.  Tell both women to grow up and get some some spine.  Criminey.", "My stomach hates me and I can eat very little, but I still cook meals for my family that they eat around me. Does it suck, yes but you have to except that people eat differently to you", "Yeah. NTA.", "Adding to this: and give her someone to blame when her attempt at weight loss fails.", "Sister's never going to be successful dieting until she takes ownership of her own decisions on what she eats, and how much she exercises.\n\nAt the core it's a personal decision and blaming other people for her own choices is just a convenient excuse to let her slide.", "It would have been different if OP brought like a dozen donuts for everyone to share. Why is there a problem with someone bringing in food that isn\u2019t even for sharing?", "Congratulations!", "Congrats on your significant weight loss, that had to have been challenging!\n\nDoes Sister also not watch TV?  Nothing on YouTube?  Doesn't look at websites or read books or magazines?  Listen to podcasts that insert their own commercials? Food is everywhere because food is normal.  It's not up to the whole world to cater to her.  She has to make herself work with the world, not act it's the other way around.", "This is a fantastic take! Honestly, losing weight and becoming healthier is hard. Temptation is everywhere. It\u2019s about having a healthy relationship with food. It\u2019s about realizing that we fuel our bodies and taking steps to become better at it. We can\u2019t force everyone around us to have the same diet.", "Congratulations!! What an amazing accomplishment!", "Bet she was hangry and the carrot she was headed for was not looking so good next to that fritter. She will have to get over the fact that other people can eat things she cannot - but it wouldn't kill you to give her a little grace on this journey.", "Good for you! Congratulation on the 40!  That's amazing!  \n\nI automatically cut all meals in half.  I've found if I eat half, then pause, I'm usually satisfied, not necessarily Full, but satisfied, and happy that my lunch for tomorrow is already made.  :)  A half a burger makes a great lunch.  Keep up the great work!!!", "Absolutely agree. The sister didn't need to react that way, and could have let the OP know calmly. But, now that OP knows the sister is trying to improve her dietary habits, it's the nice thing to do.", "Username checks out", "My thoughts\u2026 except, if she is medically morbidly obese, then her hikes are measured in yards, not miles (or meters not km \ud83d\ude01), so inviting her on hikes is probably a future event, not present.", "I don't think the hikes are a great idea. My boyfriend is from Switzerland and I have a hard time keeping up with him on the trail. I don't know if my sister could hike the mountains and trails we usually hike as she isn't used to the activity or difficulty level.", "She tries not to eat fried foods, but going into the house, I didn't expect to have to conform to my sister's diet.", "Exactly! I have been at a function that was a five course meal and I couldn't eat the first two courses due to my food allergies. I sipped my water while looking forward to dessert that I knew was from a safe bakery.", "Im sorry but it is not \u201cunhealthy\u201d for an otherwise normal adult to eat a donut once in a while. Yes, a donut is not a healthy food but it can absolutely be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. \n\nLots of people have dietary issues and yours were thankfully just temporary. I would never expect anyone else to avoid all the foods I can\u2019t eat. That\u2019s extremely childish and selfish and just extremely odd.", "I agree with these thoughts.", "I wouldn\u2019t go LC - I\u2019d just quietly stop going by mom\u2019s house. Otherwise normal communication. When she cottons on and asks why, I\u2019d simply stare that I\u2019m not comfortable visiting places where my food preferences and consumption are policed. And then mom can make her own decisions regarding that.", "She didn\u2019t yell at a random person in public though. And I would totally ask my family/friends not to smoke in my home if I was trying to stop smoking. (No one smokes inside houses anymore but you get the idea). \n\nI\u2019ve definitely avoided smoking around people I know are trying to quit.\n\nETA.

I'm not morbidly obese, but Chubby and have joint problems unrelated to weight (yay AS) and I know I can't go on long hikes at all without pain and wouldn't feel confident climbing without possibly injuring myself. Light walks, tuning the length to what she can handle and maybe increasing it gradually, are probably better for her sister rn.", "My boyfriend is Swiss and I can barely keep up with him on the mountains we climb and trails we take.

No one offered her food, they were feeding themselves. \n\nHealthy habits doesn't include abolishing any food deemed \"unhealthy\" from the house.
