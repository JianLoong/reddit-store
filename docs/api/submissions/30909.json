Yet I\u2019m not losing a crazy amount of weight. Part of the problem is that I\u2019m on 22 medications for my conditions and several have caused weight gain or make losing hard. Lyrica was the worst one that caused me to gain 30 pounds in 2 months with no diet changes, even though it helped I had to stop because that much weight gain in a short time scared me. Bodies are weird and can do some crazy shit. Society needs to stop looking at a person and putting all the blame on them for being obese. Even it\u2019s because binge eat, they should be respected and helped instead of blaming. Would you blame a person who\u2019s anorexic or bulimic? No because people would blame the mental illness. Yet binge eating is also an eating disorder and should be treated as such also. Which means treating the mental illness that is causing someone to binge. People are quick to help those who are anorexic and bulimic by changing small aspects of daily life, so why not do so for those who have food addiction issues. Let encourage people instead of making the struggle harder.", "I am also morbidly obese. I also have 3 other adults in the house - a husband and adult children.

But she seems to be aware and by her reaction I wonder if this has happened before as well or she is just dismissive and unsupportive in general.", "You understand that everyone's struggle is different, right? And she needs to do the baby steps, maybe with someone else holding her, before she can walk it alone.", "I'm not seeing the question in your original post, and I don't see where the OP is not supportive.  It all seems fairly cut and dry.  I get the OP not anticipating that eating a breakfast they brought for themselves would be an issue.  I get the OP questioning whether they should apologize, given that there was no forewarning about bringing the food."]}
