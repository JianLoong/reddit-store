This is the first time either of us have lived in a HOA and we\u2019ve been trying to adjust and learn more about it. We\u2019ve been starting to get more involved in the community as time has gone by.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the families in our community is a family of 4, the mom Jen (33F), the dad Manny (32M) and their two boys, Rayce (13M) and Murray (11M).\r  \n\r  \nMy husband and I have met Rayce a number of times in the past 6 months, always in the fitness center. The minimum age to use the fitness center alone is 13, so he\u2019s just old enough to be there without parents, so we hadn\u2019t met his parents or Murray yet. Rayce would talk to us sometimes, about a variety of things like his girlfriend, school, ect. He only brought up his family a few times, and the main thing we remember about his family was that he told us he hated his brother, he told us this was after Murray had been transphobic to one of Rayce\u2019s friends, so we could see why he was mad. He mentioned his brother was \u201cintroverted and nerdy\u201d and was glad he never wanted to go to the gym. Rayce also mentioned he was not a natural blonde one day. He was talking about how he and his baseball teammates dyed their hair blonde for some tournament he was in, and when Rayce saw the blonde, he liked it better than his natural dark brown hair. Rayce has a fairly normal fluffy, fairly short haircut that I\u2019ve seen a lot of middle school boys have. \r  \n\r  \nOn Saturday, our HOA had a \u201cwinter block party\u201d, so we decided to go. We ended up running into Rayce and his family, my husband made a comment about how Rayce didn\u2019t look related to his family bc he dyes his hair, then Murray said \u201clike a f\\*g\u201d. My husband and I were shocked and didn\u2019t know what to say, but we could see Rayce was uncomfortable. Murray and the parents had walked to a different booth at the party, when Rayce apologized to us and told us Murray will regularly make bigoted comments and it embarrasses Rayce but the parents do nothing. My husband asked Rayce if he needed help, he said he didn\u2019t care either way. My husband and I went to the parents and told them we were concerned for Rayce, they told us to mind our own business and said that the boys \u201calready hate each other and don\u2019t need more division\u201d, she said that \u201cyou Gen Zers are so judgy when you\u2019re not a parent yourself and told us to f-off.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the fair ended, the mom went on Facebook and posted about me in the HOA group. I explained my side of the story online to. Since then, my husband and I have gotten dirty looks from some people in the community. However, on the upside, Rayce told me that hes thankful for us because other members of the community have called out his parents for their parenting and now his parents feel pressured to punish Murray.
