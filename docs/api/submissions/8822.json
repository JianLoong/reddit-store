He asked if she had a boyfriend, I said no to which he insinuated I\u2019d be going to the bars and clubs with men around which wasn\u2019t our intentions at all. He said I should save my money, wait for him to go, and that it\u2019s not safe. I then asked what would happen if I went despite him not liking it and he said \u201cfuck around and find out\u201d.

Your boyfriend is being controlling and his comment about going to bars and clubs with men sounds to me like he doesn\u2019t trust you.

I intend to go there some day and I will probably be going by myself (F) and I'm not even a little worried about it. But that's beside the point.

Telling you not to go is just controlling, and he obviously thinks you will cheat on him.\n\nSome men (not all) will react that way because if they were in the same situation, on a boys trip they would go clubbing and to bars/looking for women and they probably wouldn't say no or be able to reject advances- so they think \"if I couldn't handle it/not cheat how can she\" . \n\nEven if you did go to a bar or club, as long as you are loyal and respectful to the relationship I don't see any issue at all with this.

Have a stirn conversation with your boyfriend (not over the phone if possible), tell him that he doesn't get to control your life like that (saying \"do whatever the fuck you want\" is very manipulative) and tell him that he either has to accept it or get out.

Do you want someone holding your relationship over your head like this whenever he can't be around to supervise you?", "It sounds like he is using 'your safety' as an excuse to control you. Even if there are legitimate concerns for you safety, you still have the right to make your own decisions. The point of personal freedom is that people have the right to make a choice even if some people don't agree with it."]}
