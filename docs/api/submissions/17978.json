Next time try and come up with a compromise.", "Soft YTA\n\nI think you should apologize to your mum and take her out for a redo mum/son day. As for your gf I can't begin to understand how hard mothers day is for her but I don't think it's healthy for her, you or anyone to keep that cycle going because all mothers days will be like this and that's not fair on anyone. I feel like she could have had some understanding and came with you to see your mum and also showed some empathy for what your mum has been through. You only get one mum, imagine if she passes and you never spent mothers day with her. \n\nThere is always a way to work things around. You could do something special with your partner in the morning that honours the memory of her baby. You could plant a tree, donate, volunteer, if there is a gravesite you could take flowers and have a picnic or have it at a park or a  memory box that you can add things to each year even writing down thoughts and feelings. Some parents of stillborn births don't feel like they are acknowledged as a mum or dad so it's good to validate that and ask her questions about her baby as some have said they find that easier for them. Then spend the late arvo/dinner with your mum. Or vice versa and you could take the next day off with your partner and fill the day full off fun activities or just to have a movie day. I think the second day is important as the grief for mothers day will affect your partner the week leading up and the week after. \n\nBut definitely don't let your partner swindle the full day away from your mum or even her mum because as I said before it's not fair or a healthy cycle for all parties.\n\nEdit: I just read more info and it must be hard for the both of you especially being 2 years ago. I stand by what I said but I also think your mum should understand how difficult it still is on this day for you guys and in the future you can do the spilt day as I said and then another day where it's just you and your mum. Also I would spend the first part of mothers day with your mum and the rest with your partner because as the day carries on the mental toll will get heavier.", "YTA.

And like others have said, why couldn't you see Rose in the morning and mom in the afternoon? Or vice versa? Or bring Rose to the outing with your mom? Why do they have to be separate events? \n\nThe way it's written makes me feel like you told Rose you had to go, and she prevented you from seeing your mom.", "YTA literally what the hell is wrong with you?", "Well, YTA for breaking your promise, but I don't get this thing about spending time with your mother once you leave home. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe it's just me but I don't see many UK adults going specially to visit their mums on Mother's Day. Once I left home I sent my Mum a card and flowers. The only reason I've seen her every Mother's Day in the last decade is that she lived alone a five-minute walk away and always comes for Sunday lunch.

It's understandable that it would be a difficult day for her, no matter how much time goes by. OP is an AH for how he handled everything, but there's nothing unreasonable or outlandish about how his gf was feeling.", "That\u2019s not what was asked. OP was asked if Rose, the GF, is aware that OP\u2019s mother had cancer. It wasn\u2019t whether or not OP\u2019s mother knew about the stillbirth.", "Oh wow I did not understood she lost the baby 2 years ago. I still voted for AH but he is even more so... And yes the GF seriously needs therapy.", "I didn\u2019t realize they lost the baby two years ago. I thought this all happened close together. Yikes. YTA and the GF needs therapy", "Not anymore.", "His girlfriend gave birth to their stillborn baby. Rather traumatic and understandable she also needed support on this day.", "Ah, yes, you\u2019re correct.", "Yeah that\u2019s always why I try to read comments before I say anything. He answered it in a comment.", "I mean she was still a mother of a baby, that baby just died. It\u2019s not insane to celebrate it. She gave birth. But it is a little over the top that he couldn\u2019t even go with his mother for dinner or something.", "Okay I'm not saying GF wouldn't benefit from therapy but it's not abnormal that she's grieving two years later, especially on mother's day, especially when it's near the anniversary. It will always be a hard date for her, no matter how many years pass.", ">it's not abnormal that she's grieving two years later\n\nNot at all. Some people aren't getting this.", "He is not the AH for prioritising his GF over his mother, he is for not having the decency to inform his mother before Mother's Day when she was expecting to spend the day with him.", "Right? I\u2019m suspicious of this whole thing though, bc he also says he\u2019s \u201cthinks\u201d his Mom was aware they had lost the baby\u2026.but she would have been the Grandmother, and I feel like that\u2019s something she would remember. He said stillborn, so far enough along in the pregnancy that surely people would have known & been aware of a coming baby.\n\nEdit: Correction, I misread the comment he answered where he said he thinks she\u2019s aware - that was in reference to his GF being aware of his Mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis, not his Mother being aware of the loss of the baby.", "Yeah but the whole thing is still weird/sketchy.", "Agreed"]}
