Next time try and come up with a compromise.", "Soft YTA\n\nI think you should apologize to your mum and take her out for a redo mum/son day. As for your gf I can't begin to understand how hard mothers day is for her but I don't think it's healthy for her, you or anyone to keep that cycle going because all mothers days will be like this and that's not fair on anyone. I feel like she could have had some understanding and came with you to see your mum and also showed some empathy for what your mum has been through. You only get one mum, imagine if she passes and you never spent mothers day with her. \n\nThere is always a way to work things around. You could do something special with your partner in the morning that honours the memory of her baby. You could plant a tree, donate, volunteer, if there is a gravesite you could take flowers and have a picnic or have it at a park or a  memory box that you can add things to each year even writing down thoughts and feelings. Some parents of stillborn births don't feel like they are acknowledged as a mum or dad so it's good to validate that and ask her questions about her baby as some have said they find that easier for them. Then spend the late arvo/dinner with your mum. Or vice versa and you could take the next day off with your partner and fill the day full off fun activities or just to have a movie day. I think the second day is important as the grief for mothers day will affect your partner the week leading up and the week after. \n\nBut definitely don't let your partner swindle the full day away from your mum or even her mum because as I said before it's not fair or a healthy cycle for all parties.\n\nEdit: I just read more info and it must be hard for the both of you especially being 2 years ago. I stand by what I said but I also think your mum should understand how difficult it still is on this day for you guys and in the future you can do the spilt day as I said and then another day where it's just you and your mum. Also I would spend the first part of mothers day with your mum and the rest with your partner because as the day carries on the mental toll will get heavier.", "YTA.

And like others have said, why couldn't you see Rose in the morning and mom in the afternoon? Or vice versa? Or bring Rose to the outing with your mom? Why do they have to be separate events? \n\nThe way it's written makes me feel like you told Rose you had to go, and she prevented you from seeing your mom.", "YTA literally what the hell is wrong with you?", "Well, YTA for breaking your promise, but I don't get this thing about spending time with your mother once you leave home. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe it's just me but I don't see many UK adults going specially to visit their mums on Mother's Day. Once I left home I sent my Mum a card and flowers. The only reason I've seen her every Mother's Day in the last decade is that she lived alone a five-minute walk away and always comes for Sunday lunch.

It's only been TWO YEARS since she gave birth to a baby who wasn't alive and it's a double whammy of mother's day and being near the anniversary. Maybe she thought she'd be okay. Maybe OP didn't tell her he'd be going out and sprung it on her. He's not exactly stellar with communication.", "That\u2019s not what was asked. OP was asked if Rose, the GF, is aware that OP\u2019s mother had cancer. It wasn\u2019t whether or not OP\u2019s mother knew about the stillbirth.", "Oh wow I did not understood she lost the baby 2 years ago. I still voted for AH but he is even more so... And yes the GF seriously needs therapy.", "I didn\u2019t realize they lost the baby two years ago. I thought this all happened close together. Yikes. YTA and the GF needs therapy", "Not anymore.", "His girlfriend gave birth to their stillborn baby. Rather traumatic and understandable she also needed support on this day.", "Ah, yes, you\u2019re correct.", "Yeah that\u2019s always why I try to read comments before I say anything. He answered it in a comment.", "I mean she was still a mother of a baby, that baby just died. It\u2019s not insane to celebrate it. She gave birth. But it is a little over the top that he couldn\u2019t even go with his mother for dinner or something.", "Okay I'm not saying GF wouldn't benefit from therapy but it's not abnormal that she's grieving two years later, especially on mother's day, especially when it's near the anniversary. It will always be a hard date for her, no matter how many years pass.", ">it's not abnormal that she's grieving two years later\n\nNot at all. Some people aren't getting this.", "He is not the AH for prioritising his GF over his mother, he is for not having the decency to inform his mother before Mother's Day when she was expecting to spend the day with him.", "Right? I\u2019m suspicious of this whole thing though, bc he also says he\u2019s \u201cthinks\u201d his Mom was aware they had lost the baby\u2026.but she would have been the Grandmother, and I feel like that\u2019s something she would remember. He said stillborn, so far enough along in the pregnancy that surely people would have known & been aware of a coming baby.\n\nEdit: Correction, I misread the comment he answered where he said he thinks she\u2019s aware - that was in reference to his GF being aware of his Mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis, not his Mother being aware of the loss of the baby.", "Yeah but the whole thing is still weird/sketchy.", "Agreed", "You sound immature for a 24-year-old. You say your girlfriend had a stillborn baby, not that 'WE' had a stillborn baby. You made a promise to her to ALWAYS spend mother's Day with her? Then you tell your mother you'll spend time with her and blow her off because your girlfriend is 'feeling lonely'? Grow up and maybe get some counseling instead of asking for opinions on Reddit. ( BTW, did your sister spend mother's day with mom?! There was no mention of that.) YTA.", "Obviously YTA. You were stupid to promise your gf at the time to \"celebrate\"/mourn every year with her. Your mother almost died on you. You prioritized your girlfriend having the sadz. \n\nAnd your gf is also an AH for allowing you to do something so stupid and hurtful to your mom.", "YTA...and your \"friend\" needs to know better. She's manipulating you and will separate you from your family..watch yourself.", "Here's a bonus tip OP.  Cancer isn't curable.  It's goes into remission.  If you're lucky it may not come back.  Given your mom's age, she'll likely face this battle again. You really f\\*cked up.  And honestly, I'm not a fan of your GF for not considering what your mom has gone through.  I understand GF's loss but it doesn't make her the only person to face a tragedy.", "YTA \u2026. You spent some time with your girlfriend.  You could\u2019ve went and did whatever with your mom and came to her . You literally said your mom had cancer , she was given a second chance you basically saying she\u2019s not important . Your girlfriend would have been okay and it was selfish for her to take away that day completely smh !", "Yta why would you make a promise like that? You put yourself into a bad situation. The only way out is through clear communication and action. To gf \"I apologize for making a promise that I couldn't keep. I know that you were hurt and feeling down last year but my mother has had cancer and is still my mother and it's important to me that I, but preferably we, spend this time with her\" and to mom \"I apologize for telling you I'd do something and I left you hanging. I made a promise I couldn't keep and am still learning to navigate my relationship properly. I'd love to take you to dinner to make it up to you\" if your gf isn't receptive to you communicating in a healthy way and trying to do the right thing, simply because she's selfish and needy, you'll need to get rid of that one", "YTA. Your mom has cancer and who knows if it will come back. Time is limited regardless since she\u2019s getting older and one day she might not be around. Your girlfriend and her apparently get on, so you could have spent the day with both. Also get her to seek out mental health support for her loss.", "YTA. My son bailed. No hard feelings overall but I\u2019d never speak my honest truth to him. I guess that makes me the asshole to myself. I just started leaving family suppers early and saying goodbye in my Merry way.", "YTA. \n\nAre you insane? Your mom just beat cancer and you didn't spend mother day with YOUR MOTHER to be with your NOW girlfriend - who may or may not be your future wife?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you are young, but how clueless can you be? Did it even cross your mind that you don't know the future and maybe this was the last mother's day you could spend with your mom?", "YTA - Your mother had a big wake up call of \"how many Mother's Days do I have left\" and wanted to restraighten your bond now that she's back in good health. It is very unfortunate that your GF had a stillbirth but dedicating every Mother's Day to her going forward is not a proper way to get process grief. The day is now tainted with remembering the tragic event instead of being something more celebratory. Why is the promise made to your GF stronger than the one you made to your own mother? Lastly, with this was also being your child, thus making them the grandchild to your mother, why didnt you just take them both out to brunch or something they can both enjoy together? I truly wonder how saddened your mother must have been to not only be dealing with cancer but also losing her grandchild.", "YTA - There are so many options that you had that could've made this work for all parties but you chose the one that said, with no notice, \"Fuck, Mom\".", "I would like to give you my sympathy for the loss of your baby. You and Rose went through some that no one should ever have to go through. I do wish the best for both of you. If you (or Rose) have not done so already, please join a support group or find a therapist. Grieving is healthy and Rose should be allowed to grieve, but she can't stay there. \n\nShe needs to be able to live. You need to be able to visit your mother, especially when you don't know how long she has left. I honestly think the three of you need to create an activity you can do together. \n\nYTA mainly because you never told your mother you weren't coming. You failed in that regard. Cancer is a very scary thing and she just wants to spend time with you", "YTA!  I understand that Rose has suffered but YOUR MOM JUST RECOVERED FROM CANCER.  Do you not understand that?  She's 45 yrs. old and faced the idea that she could die.  45 years old.  She didn't celebrate Mother's day with you last year because she was battling CANCER.  She then told you she wanted to spend this Mother's Day with you, you agreed and then bailed on her.  I completely understand why she's hurt.  Do you even care about what your mom went through.  I hope you never have a child who cares as little as you do.", "YTA. Don't make plans you that you're not going to follow through with!

You could have explained to her (mom) that you have another commitment, but would love to schedule mother/son day for another day. \n\nBut your Mom is unreasonable if she thinks her adult son should put her ahead of the mother of his child for mothers day. \n\nAlso -- in the future, you really shouldn't say \"my gf had a stillbirth\" when it was your child.

Yes, the cancer is a big deal, but he could spend a special day with his mother ANY day of the year. He did however make a promise to his girlfriend and he is an AH for not telling his mother about this commitment when essentially double-booking himself. He is not an AH for sticking to his promise to his GF. Stillbirth is absolutely heart- shattering. I'd be torn to bits mourning what could have been, particularly on a day when everyone else is running around with cards, chocolates and roses. GF lost a child. It doesn't make her any less of a mother.", "YTA", "Yeah why was just splitting up the day not considered here? \n\nBottom line, OP promised his mom he would be with her that day and he bailed last minute.

You especially can't make promises and then just bail without a word.\n\nYou could... should... have been an adult and made a decision.   Some people might think bad of you if your decision had been to keep your promise to your GF.

You could (should) have handled this so much better by being upfront and telling your Mom, this is a hard day for Rose, I'm going to be with her and that's the way it needs to be as I need to support her until she decides she doesn't need it.   It's this specific day for a specific reason, I hope you understand and can we have our day  at whatever day you choose.

You could\u2019ve included them both, you could\u2019ve spent time with one then another say brunch or dinner or what have you. Your gf, while that was horrible to happen to her, could take that time you are with your mom (if for some reason she can\u2019t be included) to herself, get a massage, grieve and reflect alone or with friends, maybe go to a therapy session or grief counselor. She\u2019s an adult and unfortunately she cannot dictate every minute of the day and needs to learn to self soothe and cope. She never should have dominated your whole day. Finally, soft AH to your mother continuing to hold a grudge and be petty (again the chemo part does make it a soft one since I get that she didn\u2019t get to celebrate last year) I\u2019m guessing she has no idea about the reason why though and probably thinks you don\u2019t care. Still she could\u2019ve handled that better. Next time communicate with all parties, schedule actual times with them and follow through. This is teenage logic IMO. And you should make it up to your mom, get her flowers and you cook her dinner snd surprise her and apologize!!", "YTA.  Why couldn't you split the day with both of them? That would have been the easiest way without making anyone mad at you for skipping I have my wife, my mom, and my MIL, and for 10 years before my son was born, he was always split 2 ways. for the last 12 years, the day is split 3 ways.", "YTA. You made a promise to your mom and broke it. You told your girlfriend you\u2019d spend every Mother\u2019s Day with her- you also lied because you told your mom you would spend it with her. So you were going to lie either way?\n\nYour girlfriend is also a huge asshole. Your mom just survived CANCER. And because she was \u201clonely\u201d you ditched your mom. What is wrong with her. This is such a selfish BS thing to ask you to do. And you are a huge asshole for doing it.\n\nYou owe your mom a HUGE apology.", "Dude, YTA, you could have spent ANY amount of time with your mother and chose not to, wtf? Even just an hour to have lunch or something. That\u2019s awful of you! I\u2019m sorry your gf miscarried, but your own mother matters too and you just told her she doesn\u2019t to you.

Why didn't you AND your girlfriend go visit your mom for a while - I mean it's great that your being kind to Rose - but to \"promise to do Mother's Day\" with her every year seems like you are already planning on future days to be disrespectful to your mom - which is what the day is supposed to be about - not your girlfriend.

Yep, she's being petty and A H ish.\n\nYou've promised that you'd do every Mother's Day with Rose, so you will have to make some plans for your mother for her future Mother's Days.\n\nI think that means you have to have both of them celebrate together. How likely is that?\n\nYou're ~~NTA~~ A H for not letting your mother know your plans. I can already see conflict between your mother and Rose (or who ever you will eventually marry). \n\nWork on that realizing that you can't please everyone but keeping everyone in the loop will prevent you from being a TOTAL A H.\n\nEdited", "Mother's Day is just a made up commercial date to sell more hallmark cards and expensive flowers.

I don\u2019t think anyone can know how traumatic a stillbirth can be unless they\u2019ve had one (I haven\u2019t, but am pregnant and had a miscarriage scare and it was probably the most agonizing thing I\u2019ve gone through). Your girlfriend was and is a mother, even if her baby isn\u2019t physically with her or you. She deserves to have you there for Mother\u2019s Day.

Instead, you unilaterally chose which promise to keep, and that means you unilaterally take the blame.", "YTA , so every single mothers day, you have to be with your gf who isn't even a mom a child that ever lived outside the womb?? \n\nNo. Just no.

It was unfair to cancel - you could have still spent part of the day with your girlfriend too.", "YTA\n\nThere is so much missing conversation and communication from this. Wait am I so understand that you have NOT apologized to your mother and you're waiting on deliberation from your friends?\n\nWhat did you tell your mother when she asked to spend Mother's Day together and you already promised it with your girlfriend? Did you just walk into this entire situation not communicating clearly to either of the women in your life?\n\nIt would also be really helpful if you were to give information about the relationship between the two women in your life. If she was going to be the mother of her granddaughter, is she not also upset about that? Have they ever spoken about that, or do they hate each other and they compete over your attention all the time?", "YTA. This woman fucking won c\u00e1ncer. It's one day.

Yes, YTA.  I understand your gf needed you that day, but you still should have informed your mom that hey, my plans changed cause my gf really needs me. Or at the very least compromised with gf and mom by doing lunch or dinner with mom instead of the whole day.", "Ok, YTA here but is anyone else noticing the part where Rose said she was lonely and didn\u2019t want him to leave?

Your girlfriend had a tragedy, and on mother's day I know for a fact she probably felt like the whole world was against her. I know that your mom will be angry for a while, but in the end you don't have to explain or make up for anything. You made a choice, and now you have to live with it. Honestly either way this coulda went, someone would have been mad. Your mom openly, or your girlfriend silently. And honestly I don't envy either situation. Just take it easy, and make sure everyone feels validated in the end. You don't have to explain yourself, but you do have to make sure the situation doesn't unnecessarily escalate.", "YTA.

(Most holidays are) You could celebrate the holiday on any day of the year. Setting a specific date just makes sure it\u2019s not continuously pushed off and lets society as a whole celebrate mothers. And where Im going with this is that OP could have potentially planned to celebrate his mom on like the Saturday before or something. Maybe it would have still caused issues, but still leagues better than making plans and flaking out. \n\nESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THIS IS THE FIRST MOTHER\u2019S DAY SINCE THE MOM WENT INTO REMISSION! Basically this was the Mothers Day of all the past skipped Mothers Day as well as further celebrating the mom\u2019s remission.", "???", "Did she even try and consider how important it was for you to spend time with your mother who just went into remission for cancer?

Your cancer surviving mother never gets a Mother's Day with her only son ever again? Wow.

I also HAVE a stepmam and a Mam. \n\nMother's Day, I do brunch with my Mam and my brothers. I meet up with her before the others to go shopping. We have a nice meal, go for a walk, then my brothers go home to spend time with Mam while I come home to my kids, where we watch favourite movies and have a nice dinner together. \n\nThe next day, I go down to see my stepmam. \n\nMOST people end up splitting the day somehow.", "Yeah I\u2019m all for creative solutions but everybody suggesting they just combine events is nuts. The assumption is OP\u2019s girlfriend wants to \u201ccelebrate being a mother\u201d too even though he never said anything like that!!!! It\u2019s just as likely, actually more likely, that she is just devastated on this day and OP doesn\u2019t know what to do about it. This isn\u2019t a Mother\u2019s Day hog situation like we\u2019ve seen posted here a lot recently\n\nEdited to add; and OP didn\u2019t say this specifically, but some things have suggested he has some trauma around this day also", "So, is your gf in therapy? What r future plans? If you have children (birth/surrogacy/adoption), are they gonna be allowed to celebrate Mother's Day? Or will they have to sit it out every yr while they watch their classmates celebrate it? What about when your mother passes? Are you gonna be able to remember this and not hold resentment toward your gf? Because I know many ppl that when their mom pass all wish for 'one more Mother's day' with them and look back with regret at all the missed times. Will you be able to look back at this and not hold anger that you had one and it was missed? Whether you're an AH or not, it doesn't matter the decision was made. Now you gotta look into what that means for your future and if you're able to handle the consequences of it.", "OP doesn't even know if his gf knows about the cancer.

I found myself depressed and crying on Mother's Day because I thought I'd be celebrating it or at least be pregnant. I couldn't imagine if I'd had a failed pregnancy along the way, let alone a still birth.\n\nIMO, OP should have spent either half the day with both of them, or done an early mother's day celebration with his mom on Saturday and stayed home to comfort his girlfriend on Sunday.", "Haha I am!", "Yeah something is weird about this post. Sometimes in miscarriage or stillbirth situations (which are pretty different for the record, I\u2019ve had a miscarriage which was bad enough but giving birth to a dead baby is the stuff of living nightmares) the dad really checks out through, either because it hurts too much to think about or he just doesn\u2019t think he has the right to grieve too. So I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he was just totally noncommunicative with his family about the situation. That might be the root of the whole issue", "OP didn\u2019t handle this right but I honestly can\u2019t understand why people are surprised she\u2019s still upset on Mother\u2019s Day when her baby died only two years later (and she clearly considers Mother\u2019s Day close to the anniversary of it). Do you guys not know a stillbirth is not a miscarriage?", "Definitely possible! I'm just like... For it to be late enough for it to be considered a stillbirth, did the family not know she was pregnant??", "I sincerely doubt she wants to *celebrate* it, she probably just feels horrible and despondent on the day itself because it reminds her intensely of her child that died", "Oh yeah I was interpreting that as \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they *remember*\u201d not \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they know at all\u201d", "Yeah that\u2019s what I meant I guess. I just saw some people behaving as if this poor woman doesn\u2019t have the right to call herself a mother\u2026 she gave birth! To a whole baby! It just wasn\u2019t alive. I feel for her I do.", "That is such a sad picture.", "Oh I get you, and agree, I\u2019ve seen those comments, and people apparently thinking it\u2019s totally abnormal the gf is still fairly traumatized.  There\u2019s some serious lack of empathy happening in the comments this post, but that\u2019s kind of common for stillbirth and child loss situations unfortunately", "She could have had the support of her partner for most of the day and then let him go spend some time with his mother who had just gone into remission from cancer.", "He could have spent any other day with his mother. His partner\u2019s grief over the anniversary of losing their child, on top of it being so close to Mother\u2019s Day, and the fact that he already promised he would be there to support her through that, takes precedence over a mother son day that could happen any time. His mistake was double booking himself. You would think a woman who is in remission from cancer and realizes how fragile life is would have more sympathy for a woman grieving her child\u2019s death on Mother\u2019s Day. And if she wants to see her son so badly bc she is worried about not having more time, she shouldn\u2019t be so petty as to disinvite him from the birthday."]}
