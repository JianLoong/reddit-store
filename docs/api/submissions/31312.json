They go out to plays, events and travel all the time.  Not saying they are filthy rich but let\u2019s just say money is not an issue \n\nMy husband and I are not struggling but I stopped working when I had kids cuz it\u2019s cheaper than paying for childcare.   We watch our money but doing fine financially. We can still dine out occasionally, movies, travel only locally and stay within a budget \n\nSo\u2026we\u2019re not starving but it really bugs me that the in laws aren\u2019t more involved with the kids.  When the school have fundraisers, they\u2019re practically begging for them to donate and they put in $20.  At the same convo, they will brag about donating to their college thousands\u2026.enough to be named on a wall. \n\nThey will take and pay for their other daughter (who is single and over 45)  to travel with them but never once asked us.  Same for tickets to concerts or Hollywood bowl events.  They don\u2019t hate us and will get along the few times we are together (they live locally by the way\u2026they\u2019re just too busy to see us) and seem to like the kids but they certainly don\u2019t act like grandparents.  My kids are their only grandkids btw.  \n\nMy husband tries to keep the peace and don\u2019t want to say anything but it really bothers me especially when i hear how \u201cgrandparents spoil the kids\u201d and having to lie when people make comments of how they must be.  (They are highly regarded because of how much they donate/contribute to different places)\n\n2 weeks ago when i heard them talk about all the stuff they been doing and donating/sponsoring, i couldn\u2019t help myself and call them out on it.  I\u2019ve had enough after 10 years!  In my most sarcastic fake sweet voice I asked why they donate so much but yet can\u2019t support the kids and their school?  And why don\u2019t they make more time for the grandkids.  Sometimes the kids ask why they don\u2019t do more and I just told them they don\u2019t want to.\n\nMy husband is mad and said I was out of line.  That his parents have a right to do whatever they want with their money.  So I said I have a right to not have to listen to it.  They can\u2019t brag to their friends and family about \u201cthe grandkids\u201d as if they are super involved grandparents and I\u2019m supposed to sit idly by and let them take credit for things they don\u2019t do?\n\nThey are in their 80s so I do feel kind of bad.  Except they are not \u201cold\u201d and they so spry and have more energy and social life than me\n\nAnyways, AITA for calling them out?  Should I have just kept my mouth shut and continue to brush off the kids when they ask why?  Or just nod and smile when people just say the kids must be the luckiest to have grandparents like them.\n\nAm I in the wrong to tell my husband at the minimum I get to walk away when they start bragging so I don\u2019t have to hear it?", "created_utc": 1700414426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z1yxh/aita_for_calling_out_parent_in_laws_for_not/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth of the matter is, yes YTA. If you wanted to make a point, you could have easily corrected those who bring up the in-laws being being wonderful grandparents. When you state facts, not emotional diatribes, you make a point while still have ground to stand on.

You most definitely crossed a line - the ILs have a right to spend their money however they want.

Seriously. Even if it is true, you don\u2019t tell them that! The only person you are hurting is them.

So why lie and agree with them in that? They do have the right to decide where to spend their money though. It sucks that they might be able to donate something for the fundraisers of their grandkids school but at the end of the day it remains THEIR money, theirs to spend however they decide. They do suck for bragging about being involved grandparents if I'm understanding your post correctly, and they aren't. Because time with their grandkids even away from you if they so chose, doesn't have to cost them a dime. You're not entitled to their money though and while I get you're frustrated, you should find someone else to vent to and not cause an issue because you feel your kids are entitled to their grandparents wallets", "ESH. Obviously you're not entitled to their money. You know that.\n\nBut it sounds like you are saying they bragging about being doting grandparents when they aren't. That would annoy me to no end.", "YTA and entitled and yes you do sound aggressive. Why should your husband's parents do anything with your children if they don't want to. They're your children so your responsibility.  They're in their 80s so perhaps they also feel too old to look after your children and have just decided not to tell you that. It's also their money so they can do what they like with it.", "ESH. Your husband is right that it's their money and they're entitled to spend it however they wish. You aren't owed their money. Also, it makes sense that if their daughter is single, she might be more inclined to want to holiday in company with her parents. \n\nHowever, the flip side of that is that you don't need to lie for them and pretend they're generous and involved as grandparents. If someone gushes that they must be amazing because of how generous they are with their *alma mater* or other charities, just say that you get on fine when you're in company but their primary interests lie elsewhere.", "So my parents have the money to donate to the grandkids and my in laws do too however\u2026my SIL & BIL don\u2019t involve neither my or my husbands parents.  They don\u2019t invite them to soccer games, don\u2019t invite them to the fun runs at school.  When they have a fundraiser at school the parents send a link to the grandparents, aunts and uncles\u2026the kids aren\u2019t the ones asking and no one ever gets a thank you.  I honestly don\u2019t blame either set of grandparents for not donating.  As an aunt, I\u2019m done after this years fundraisers.  Doesn\u2019t teach the kids any work ethic if they can\u2019t ask me in person or by phone to donate.  I\u2019ve spent $150 between 2 kids and don\u2019t even get acknowledged.  Not looking for a hand written thank you card, just a simple acknowledgement.  Not saying you don\u2019t/do do this, just letting you know the reason why my parents and in laws don\u2019t donate or donate the bare minimum to the nieces and nephews.  Zero appreciation, parents just expect everyone should be handing out money.  The kids complain every time they have to see the grandparents.

If I were them I would make sure that you don\u2019t get anything out of my will after your meltdown.", "YTA. You thought you were marrying money, but his parents just refuse to kick off, huh?", "ESH. My in-laws just loved to have people say how generous and thoughtful they were, but at the end of the day, weren't good grandparents at all. I would hear how they gave money to people they barely knew, because they wanted to be loved. Buying love only lasts as long as the cash flow does.\n\nBUT - it is their money. They can spend it how they want. You could have been tactful and asked them in a very measured way, rather than lose it. You should have put some thought into how you wanted to address it. It's fair to have the conversation but approach can be half of the battle.\n\nI get being upset. My husband didn't want to fight with his family either, as they were very manipulative and had an adoring outside audience as well. But the day that I called my SIL out on something, I had thought about how to approach it for years before I finally did. He was also mad at me when we were alone and said I shouldn't have said anything, and I just shrugged and said, \"Well, I don't care. You said for years you would handle it. You didn't.\" Your husband is probably mad at himself for not sitting his parents down and having an honest conversation. He could have said, \"Instead of giving yourself a membership to the zoo, maybe you could give it to us.\" Also, maybe his parents are giving him money that you aren't aware of.\n\nI think it's time to have a conversation with your husband about his inability to have an honest conversation with his parents, and also about your frustration. I think half the problem is that he's dismissing your feelings for peace.", "Probably, but who cares. They aren't going to do anything different and you probably won't either. Your husband will get over it too. Was it an asshole thing to do, certainly, but I think you meant to be an asshole after letting your frustrations get the better of you. YTA.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.", " NTA. Well it is there money and they have a right to do what they want with it. The fact that your kids are asking how come grandma and grandpa don\u2019t wanna spend more time with them is telling.

I agree you don\u2019t have to listen to them talk about it it\u2019s also not fair that they\u2019re telling their friends and other people they know how involved they are with their grandkids when they\u2019re straight up lying. That\u2019s what they need to be called out on not where they\u2019re spending their money, but how they\u2019re not involved with their grandkids.

Its not about the money. its about the time, care, and attention that my cousins got and my siblings and I didn't.\n\nI don't think its the money that OP is talking about, but its more that it symbolizes priorities of dedication. No wonder OP is feeling hurt and frustrated, especially because the kids can see how much more excited the grandparents are about their endeavours than about them.\n\nOP and kids aren't entitled to ILs money, attention, or enthusiasm.

Really weird vibe.", "NTA.. by the sounds of it you gave them a family reality shock, you are not going to be so popular for a while and I'm sorry to say this , it's going to be hard to hear, it may eventually cost you that $20 donation every 12 months to the school..", "YTA.

They go out to plays, events and travel all the time.  Not saying they are filthy rich but let\u2019s just say money is not an issue \n\nMy husband and I are not struggling but I stopped working when I had kids cuz it\u2019s cheaper than paying for childcare.   We watch our money but doing fine financially. We can still dine out occasionally, movies, travel only locally and stay within a budget \n\nSo\u2026we\u2019re not starving but it really bugs me that the in laws aren\u2019t more involved with the kids.  When the school have fundraisers, they\u2019re practically begging for them to donate and they put in $20.  At the same convo, they will brag about donating to their college thousands\u2026.enough to be named on a wall. \n\nThey will take and pay for their other daughter (who is single and over 45)  to travel with them but never once asked us.  Same for tickets to concerts or Hollywood bowl events.  They don\u2019t hate us and will get along the few times we are together (they live locally by the way\u2026they\u2019re just too busy to see us) and seem to like the kids but they certainly don\u2019t act like grandparents.  My kids are their only grandkids btw.  \n\nMy husband tries to keep the peace and don\u2019t want to say anything but it really bothers me especially when i hear how \u201cgrandparents spoil the kids\u201d and having to lie when people make comments of how they must be.  (They are highly regarded because of how much they donate/contribute to different places)\n\n2 weeks ago when i heard them talk about all the stuff they been doing and donating/sponsoring, i couldn\u2019t help myself and call them out on it.  I\u2019ve had enough after 10 years!  In my most sarcastic fake sweet voice I asked why they donate so much but yet can\u2019t support the kids and their school?  And why don\u2019t they make more time for the grandkids.  Sometimes the kids ask why they don\u2019t do more and I just told them they don\u2019t want to.\n\nMy husband is mad and said I was out of line.  That his parents have a right to do whatever they want with their money.  So I said I have a right to not have to listen to it.  They can\u2019t brag to their friends and family about \u201cthe grandkids\u201d as if they are super involved grandparents and I\u2019m supposed to sit idly by and let them take credit for things they don\u2019t do?\n\nThey are in their 80s so I do feel kind of bad.  Except they are not \u201cold\u201d and they so spry and have more energy and social life than me\n\nAnyways, AITA for calling them out?  Should I have just kept my mouth shut and continue to brush off the kids when they ask why?  Or just nod and smile when people just say the kids must be the luckiest to have grandparents like them.\n\nAm I in the wrong to tell my husband at the minimum I get to walk away when they start bragging so I don\u2019t have to hear it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m just tired of listening to them saying to people ALL the stuff they do with us, for us, when it\u2019s not true.   Why do I have to lie to make them look better?", "You don't. Stop lying for them and let people form their opinions of your in-laws with the truth. \n\nStop lying to the kids. It will hurt them less. Assure them the in-laws love them, but don't cover for them. \n\nStop worrying about SIL vs you/husband. Maybe they know your family has each other and she has them. Maybe they understand each other better. Maybe they feel your resentment. \n\nWhatever the reason, it's their money to spend how they wish. Stop expecting it to be on you or your kids. It might be nice if they did - but you shouldn't expect it. Appreciate what they do and let the rest go.", ">I\u2019m just tired of listening to them saying to people ALL the stuff they do with us, \n\nthis is why you're NTA because your issue appears to be (and I got this from the main post too) that they're bragging around how supportive they are to their grandkids but they barely spend time with them, can't donate a measly 20 bucks without the kids begging and show favouritsm to their other kid BLATANTLY in your family's face.  \n\n\nPeople on Reddit LOVE to take a hardline stance of \"it's their money!\" but that is clearly not the issue you're having"]}
