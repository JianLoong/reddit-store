We had english together. We soon began hanging out outside of class and the summer after sophomore year he asked me out. I had already met his mother a million times before because we were always with each other. Surface level, she seemed nice, sweet, and charming.\n\nWe went to the same college and would spend weekends in each others apartments. \n\nLast summer my fianc\u00e9 proposed to me. It was like it was from a storybook or a fairytale. It was really personal and I was crying for many hours after the fact.\n\nHer odd behaviour started after we began dating. (Why don\u2019t we call her Sheila.) Sheila began being really touchy with my fianc\u00e9 (let\u2019s call him Bryan). She would would hug Bryan more, more than a mother would at least. \n\nShe just began becoming really really protective. I would call him and she would pick up, having his phone. And she would say something along the lines of \u201cYou don\u2019t love him. Not as much as I do. I will always be his first love. I am the most important woman in his life so maybe think before saying you love him because you will always be second to his mommy.\u201d \n\nThis made me really uncomfortable and it made me begin to grow distant with him. I also found (and find) it really weird when she called herself mommy after him growing out of it SEVERAL years ago.\nAnytime I was at his house she would barge in,  she would yell slurs at me and cuss me out. Or she would come over to Bryan and begin hugging him and calling him odd pet names. \n\nWhen we broke the news to Sheila that we were engaged. She broke down crying yelling that Bryan was going to \u201cforget him so some used up slut.\u201d This really hurt my feelings. She continued to drone on, eventually pushing me off the couch so she can cry into his arms.\n\nI left and sobbed for a good 45 minutes until Bryan came out of his mothers house. We haven\u2019t talked to his mother that much.\n\nWe spent the next year planning the perfect wedding. We sent out the invitation and she responded with an RSVP. We planned to have the reception and the party last week. The reason I called it off though, ruined the whole thing.\n\nRight before the wedding began I was getting dressed when Sheila came in the room to congratulate me but instead she \u201ctripped\u201d and spilled wine all down the front of my gorgeous gown. I went off, I told her that (word for word) \u201cYou have abused me ever since Bryan and I started dating. I put up with it because I love your son but I don\u2019t know if I can be in this family if you are in it. You disgust me.\u201d Is basically what I said with tears running down my cheeks and further staining my gown.\n\nI ran out of the reception hall and found myself in Bryan and my shared apartment. Nobody had known where I went until I finally answered a call from my friend. Still sobbing, I told her the whole story. She immediately came over. \n\nSo yeah, I called off a wedding because of an almost mother-in-law.
