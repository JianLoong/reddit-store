She's a very active woman, and she regularly goes to the gym. I would join her, but after my knee surgery, I don't feel as good exercising as I used to. She, on the other hand, works out at our local gym 4 days out of the week. She has told me about how she got a trainer there to give her personalized workouts, and previously, I thought nothing of it.\n\nOver the past few weeks, she has been coming home from the gym with more and more good things to tell me about her trainer, and I was happy for her as working out is one of her favorite hobbies. However, I was under the assumption that her trainer was a female, until I found out a few days ago that her trainer has been a man this whole time. \n\nHer trainer is younger than I am, and I know that my wife and I have a significant age gap. However, I never thought 'til recently that my wife could potentially be flirting with a younger man. She always talks about their new workout routines and how it's making her feel healthier, and I can't help but get jealous thinking about all the time she spends with this random guy. I even brought up the suggestion about setting up a home gym, but she told me she wouldn't get the same experience. \n\nA few days ago, I confronted her about spending too much time with this guy, and she got upset. She said I didn't trust her, and she told me she has no feelings for her trainer whatsoever. I personally am uncomfortable with the idea of my wife spending so much time around another man, even if he's supposedly a professional trainer. I told her she either had to get a new trainer (preferably a female) or leave the gym entirely. She got angry with me and yelled, saying I was too controlling, and refused to comply with my request. She has been passive aggressive towards me since. \n\nAITA for being concerned about my wife?", "created_utc": 1700969187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1841er1/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_cant_see_her_gym/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (39M) recently got into an argument with my wife (28F). She's a very active woman, and she regularly goes to the gym. I would join her, but after my knee surgery, I don't feel as good exercising as I used to. She, on the other hand, works out at our local gym 4 days out of the week. She has told me about how she got a trainer there to give her personalized workouts, and previously, I thought nothing of it.\n\nOver the past few weeks, she has been coming home from the gym with more and more good things to tell me about her trainer, and I was happy for her as working out is one of her favorite hobbies. However, I was under the assumption that her trainer was a female, until I found out a few days ago that her trainer has been a man this whole time. \n\nHer trainer is younger than I am, and I know that my wife and I have a significant age gap. However, I never thought 'til recently that my wife could potentially be flirting with a younger man. She always talks about their new workout routines and how it's making her feel healthier, and I can't help but get jealous thinking about all the time she spends with this random guy. I even brought up the suggestion about setting up a home gym, but she told me she wouldn't get the same experience. \n\nA few days ago, I confronted her about spending too much time with this guy, and she got upset. She said I didn't trust her, and she told me she has no feelings for her trainer whatsoever. I personally am uncomfortable with the idea of my wife spending so much time around another man, even if he's supposedly a professional trainer. I told her she either had to get a new trainer (preferably a female) or leave the gym entirely. She got angry with me and yelled, saying I was too controlling, and refused to comply with my request. She has been passive aggressive towards me since. \n\nAITA for being concerned about my wife?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA, this is not a porn movie, she's definitely just working out and so happy she shares her progress with you. Don't be insecure.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nIf you don't trust your wife, that's your problem. Talk to her about it and fix it on your end. She shouldn't have to subdue to your demands because of your trust issues. \n\nAlso, 'get a new trainer, preferably a female'. What do you mean preferably? Would you be okay if it's another man? Is the problem that they're getting too close? If so, is your wife allowed to have other male friends? It's the same thing.", "You are the AITA. You have no basis to accuse your wife of having an affair. You are dictating what she has to do, or else? If you do not trust your wife and your relationship there are bigger issues to address.", "Bugger off. She was open with you about him obviously cause there is nothing going on. If you are self conscious about your age gap deal with it yourself not try to dump it on your wife and put restrictions on her. Also red flag - should she be worried if you ever interact closely with another woman ??", "YTA. You should apologize for being jealous, controlling, untrusting, and for getting in the way of her fitness. I can\u2019t believe you even had to ask this question.", "YTA. Go to the gym with her and rehabilitate your knee.", "NTA, your fear is valid. Especially when she keeps mentioning him. Hope you have a good prenup.", "I\u2019m curious, I think it is natural for someone to feel inadequate in a situation that is uncomfortable. Your wife is happy, you are not able to accompany her in the gym. Has she invited you to join her? If you asked would she be uncomfortable? This is cliche for you to see her as suspect in alternative activities, but maybe this person is a professional. Is there problems with your relationship? If not then maybe a conversation about your feelings is necessary. Before you assume there is infidelity, be sure that you are accurate by talking to your partner. I don\u2019t think she would tell you how good she feels if she was involved with other forms of exercise, would she?", "ESH - Ok, I think the \"wisdom of the crowd\" here is at least telling us you could have handled this better.  Probably so.  But I think this also tells us something that so many redditors would just throw this legit concern right back at this guy... use it as an opportunity to puff out their chests and grandstand over his \"insecurities\".   Also feels a lot like projection... others fantasizing about being in great shape and getting physical attention from a personal trainer... stepping up to defend this kind of risky relationship behavior because it sounds exciting and self-actualizing.  Tells me that most of these people are ignoring human nature... and are probably - on average - gasp! - not all that successful at staying married.  \n\nAlso, I guarantee anyone if we took a truly anonymous poll of men if they would prefer their wife had a female trainer to a male trainer the results would be high 90th percentile for the female trainer.   So let's stop with the grandstanding... the projection... and let's be real with this guy for a hot second. \n\nPeople have asked, has she done anything to make him suspicious?  I think he stated that he's picking up on her increasing \"enthusiasm\" over this guy and their interactions. That would make any reasonable ~~male~~  person suspicious... especially in this context.  \n\nTo the husband... If you know you're not a particularly jealous/insecure/controlling person (maybe ask others that have known you a long time - not reddit) and your gut is telling you something is off here... then go with your gut.  That's not insecurity... that's a reasonable response and impulse towards *protecting* the relationship you have with your spouse.   \n\nJealousy is not always bad.  But, of course, it can be a suffocating for those in relationships with truly insecure people.   Regardless, there should be room in a healthy relationship to be vulnerable and real with each other on stuff like this.  If there's not, you probably have some more serious issues that would best be addressed through a competent counselor.", " YTA. \nI go to the gym three days a week and work with a trainer. When I started, my husband assumed I was working with a female but my trainer is male. He expressed he didn\u2019t like it. I told him I understood but that it was his hang-up to work through. He acknowledged this. Mind you, he never jumped to cheating. He knows I\u2019m not. He just doesn\u2019t like the idea that this guy could be touching me. My trainer NEVER touches me. He\u2019s a professional and it\u2019s his gym. He observes, gives verbal correction, and demonstrates so I can see what he\u2019s talking about. But my husband does not know this. He\u2019s never come in to check on me, and he\u2019s never brought it up again or picked an argument about it. In fact, some mornings I\u2019m too tired and I don\u2019t want to go, but he now encourages me to get up and get over there. Because he sees the gains of my effort and how proper support has helped me improve my health immensely (I wasa COVID long hauler and working out at home or independently at a gym was not working). And he trusts me. I go to the gym, I come home. My working with a man in no way implies there\u2019s flirting or inappropriate touching. It is not disrespectful to my husband because I am not doing anything disrespectful to my husband. Your wife is going to the gym, coming home and talking to you about it. You noted she loves working in her fitness. She\u2019s excited. She wants you to be excited for her. Support your wife. Love her right.
