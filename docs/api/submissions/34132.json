He sounds like the kind of asshole that will blame you and learn nothing. If you need more time with your mom, she needs to be the one to set boundaries with him. If you don\u2019t wanna be around him, choose not to be around him. But trying to make another person change doesn\u2019t really work. You need to set boundaries for yourself, and so does your mom. don\u2019t try to change him, just tell him that you will only tolerate certain behavior in your life, and then stick to the boundary. Which means it\u2019s up to you to leave, or don\u2019t open the door when he comes. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if you guys are all living in the same house or not. Obviously, whoever owns the house gets to decide who enters the house.  But telling him off isn\u2019t going to fix this. You need to avoid him.", "NTA, you shouldn't have to silently suffer through *one* shitty uncle's behavior, let alone two.", "Apologies in advance if I pass out and stop answering.
