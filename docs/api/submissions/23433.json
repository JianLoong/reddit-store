When I first started reading I thought maybe it was a financial burden with tuition, but then later on read she got a full ride.  You can't forbid her from her college education desires and completely change the path of her entire life all because of selfishly wanting her around.  If the school turns out to be a mistake, it's a mistake she has to make and realize on her own.", "YTA\n\nYou are selfish and holding her back, why have  kids if you don\u2019t want to do what\u2019s best for them and set them up to be successful adults?", "YTA, she isn\u2019t a baby anymore.  Plus going to this school will help get into a better university.  Plus she there are probably services there to help get scholarships that her high school can\u2019t offer.  You want the best for people you love please don\u2019t be selfish.", "YTA, and I don't know how anyone can say \"gentle YTA,\" no, what you did was a truly terrible thing to do. Do you think she's going to live with you the rest of her life?  She's going to leave sometime very soon, no better reason to leave than to go to a prestigious school.", "Yta- your daughter will never forgive you for hindering her education because you can\u2019t handle your emotions.", "YTA.  She's a junior in HS; she stopped being your \"baby\" a long time ago.  Treat her like an adult and allow her to reap the benefits of her hard work!", "YTA 100%. I'm in pretty much the same situation as your daughter, only 1 and a half year older. I've known since I was 11 that I would go away for my studies - nothing wrong with my family, they're great, I love them more than anything, it's just that I am ambitious and getting into that school will gave me the power to accomplish my dreams (i.e the exact f\\*ing reason your daughter wants to leave). I also always knew that it would be hard for my parents and my brother to see me go away, as we're extremely close. But ALL of them told me to go, pursue my dreams and live my life as I wanted, that I shouldn't be restricted by them. In a month I'm leaving, and though it's sometimes tough to think a lot of things will be different, we're all very excited, and they helped me a lot in finding a flat, buying new stuff, preparing for next year and appeasing my anxiety.\n\nAll of this to say, you can be sad and stressed out to see your little baby go away, while being great, supportive parents. I would have been crushed if my parents did to me what you did to her. This would have strained our relationship for ever, I'm not even sure I would have forgiven them at one point. But if they did do so, they would not have been my awesome parents. So yeah, if you force her to stay, your little girl will stay. Will she have the same relationship with you, forgive you, or just talk to you ? Hell no. And if you're doing that in thinking young people can't hold a grudge and she will soon have forgot, well... maybe she won't mention it in her speech a your funeral ? At the condition, of course, that she will attend...", "YTA she is not a baby and you are a controlling AH. \n\nYou can't keep her at home because that suits you.", "Why even let her apply if you were just going to shatter her dreams when she inevitably got accepted??\n\nYta.  Big time selfish mom fail.", "YTA. You\u2019re letting your needs trump your daughter\u2019s. That\u2019s not what a good parent does.", "This is an amazing opportunity. You are being so selfish right now, taking away something she earned, and from the sound of it, is an extraordinary student. Let her go. YTA", "INFO - why did you let her apply?", "YTA and she\u2019ll go NC with you if you blow opportunities for her.", "She got a full ride to a great school. Let go!!!!!!", "INFO: how much time did you get, from the day you found out that she applied, to the final day for making a decision? \n\nYour post makes it sound as if she applied in secret & didn\u2019t tell you until her place was confirmed. \n\nIf so then that was not sensible of her. This isn\u2019t something you can decide quickly. Although I\u2019d want to know why she felt the need to do it in secret before choosing N T A.", "Our daughter was in the exact same situation except we allowed her to go to the elite prep school. She did miss home but the education she received was unparalleled.  Dreading an empty nest is something that you must work through and not punish your daughter for.  Her hard work has been rewarded, I hope you will not allow your emotional issues to prevent your daughter from experiencing what could lead her to the fulfillment of her destiny. Consider that it is time to set her free.", "If you raised your daughter correctly, you should trust that she is capable of making the right decisions and keeping communication with you while she's away. \n\nI think that an opportunity like that does not come often and you won't meet other children who could accomplish it like she did. \n\nDon't hold your daughter back from a better and fruitful future due to your own insecurities and selfish wants. \n\nYTA (but I get why you feel the way you do)\n\nAlso, you can idk....visit her??? You know what they say, distance makes the heart grow fonder.", "YTA, ur daughter EARNED an amazing opportunity and u are holding ur own daughter back. She has done nothing but prove herself, don't push ur fears onto her.", "Yta my god did you get a daughter because u wanted her to have the best life or for you to just have a daughter so \u201dyou\u201c feel good?\nWhy the fuck did you get kids", "Of course YTA, but I'm also sensing that no amount of people telling you that will make you change your mind. You are putting your needs ahead of your child's, which makes you selfish and self centered. Your daughter deserves better after all her hard work.", "She's crying about how she doesn't want to let her baby go but if she's keeps parenting like this then the baby will go and never come back when they're 18", "How does the daughter suck here\u2026? She\u2019s upset her mom won\u2019t let her go after all that hard work but the daughter isn\u2019t really being an asshole", "All this. \n\nYTA", "This is what I was thinking, why not tell her to not even apply if you weren\u2019t going to let her go?"]}
