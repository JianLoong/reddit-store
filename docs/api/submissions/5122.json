Your family needs to stay out of your business and respect your boundaries. Your body doesn\u2019t exist for their convenience.

Rather, go NC with your family members if they continue along this line.\n\nChances are high that if you were a surrogate for your sister, she would feel free to drop the children on you (as a free babysitter/coparent) whenever she wants, without notice, expecting you to accept her every request because you conceived the babies.", "NTA.

It does sound like they would try to lay a lot of responsibility at your feet if you do surrogate. Honestly you\u2019d likely be expected to babysit often, etc. if you do do Ross, draw up a contract that states you have no obligation to the kid.", "NTA... i mean its your choice. your parents shouldn't get involved or make you feel bad for not wanting kids or make some for your sister. it was probably hard enough to carry out two pregnancies, your not a baby factory after all.", "NTA, clearly they have no respect for your boundaries.", "NTA. \n\nwhy is your family viewing being pregnant as such an easy experience? its a physical and emotional challenge for those who are pregnant and with the added pressure of potentially raising your sister's children, it makes the pregnancy experience more stressful. Youre giving up your body and changing your life drastically for 9 months and your family is acting as if youre wearing a new sweater for 9 months. If your family really wants an addition to the family, they can find the money for a surrogate.", "100%Nta, they do not respect you or your boundaries, seriously if possible you should put them on a time out if you don't want to cut contact with them, that means no phone calls, no texting, no email, no letters nothing for a weeks to a month, and when time is up make it very clear that if they keep pulling this sh\u00a1t, that you will go full nc, if they don't suck it up and accept it, it's your body your choice.", "Nta. Being a surrogate requires boundaries. They have none.", "NTA\n\nNo means no. It\u2019s a complete answer. You shouldn\u2019t have had to explain yourself even.", "NTA. They are being insensitive, cruel, and bullies. Hold onto your boundaries.", "NTA, and they're only calling you those things because they want to guilt you into it. Trying to harass someone into carrying a child is .... it's so wrong I can't even think of a good word for it.", "NTA\n\nPeople need to understand if someone says they want to be childfree then that's it.  It's nothing wrong with it.  My BFF always said she wanted to be childfree.  Her ex-husband thought he could get her to change her mind.  Oh well that didn't happen and now they are divorced.  You have to respect the person who says she want to be childfree and move on from there.", "NTA, it's obviously up to you who you surrogate for but I think your reasoning is bad. It is so unlikely that your sister and her partner would die while the kid is still in childhood that it seems like a silly sticking point.

Run it past a lawyer if necessary. The standard surrogacy agreement, of course, whatever that entails, and add that you will not assume any parenting responsibilities for any baby born from this surrogacy. Your parents should be willing to pay you for the service, and then they will have their grandkids. Your sister will then need to sit down with her husband and very seriously consider who they would want to appoint as guardian should they not be around. Couples do that all the time, and there is nothing to say that you are the only candidate. Your parents could do this! Or other siblings, or friends.. if you do the surrogacy, I think that is above and beyond anything else that anybody could ask of you. And you need to make sure everybody understands that. That's my opinion.", "NTA Parents demanding grandkids is rediculous.
