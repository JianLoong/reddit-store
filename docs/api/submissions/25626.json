Pregnancy can excuse an overemotional reaction to certain things, but it is not some sort of blanket excusal of every moronic decision the pregnant person makes.  This was premeditated and idiotic.", "She was certainly fishing for something. She told them the name and when no one remarked on it, she stirred the pot and tried to make thr moment all about the name, not about the baby. I don't think either \"dumb\" or \"clueless\" is entirely accurate. She knew what she was doing, and did it with purpose. Maybe reunification, or maybe she just wanted to be the center of drama. She's certainly a piece of work. I hope her newfound relationship with grandpa is worth all the other familial relationships she just damaged/sacrificed.\n\nNTA", "If my kid named his child after my deadbeat dad, I'd call him an idiot to his face. I cannot fathom the lack of thinking here.", "She was aching for a fight and was upset that the name didn't cause an argument. Without the argument, she couldn't set herself up as the hero doing this for selfless reasons. She's also upset that the name didn't bring an immediate reconciliation as if having a child named after her grandfather means dad has forgiven or needs to forgive his dad. She's a meddling, bumbling fool if she thinks the name makes everything all better. \n\nWhen called put on it, she retreats to victim mode and \"How dare you speak to a new mother that way!\" Giving birth isn't a free pass to say and do what you want. She's trying to manipulate everyone into creating a fake, big, happy family because she has no problem sweeping her dad's feelings under the rug.

The tree does not become friends with the axe 20+ years later, that isn't how it works.", "ESH\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the way to approach the discussion on either side. \n\nShe\u2019s being a bit unreasonable in her expectations and controlling by trying to force the conversation. That said, she does get to choose the name of her child. Also, she\u2019s legitimately recovering from a huge physical toll on her body but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she has drawn a bit of a line in the sand.\n\nYou are entitled to your feelings about it, but calling her dumb is unhelpful and rude. Giving her a hard time about the name won\u2019t change anything, either.\n\nIt sounds like the person who did handle this like a champ is your dad. He chose to focus on the love he has for his new grandson, and not to engage in the a discussion that is probably complicated and difficult for him.

My bet is her dad starts calling the baby by a nickname.", "NTA - giving birth doesn't give people a free pass from consequences and accountability for their actions and choices. She knew that this wasn't going to be a popular move and tried to strong-arm everyone into creating some kind of a Disney-moment where they magically reconciled with this \"estranged grandfather\" and finally came together as a family through the miracle of birth. Goodness gracious she needs to respect people some more.", "NTA\n\nMy mother did a similar thing to me. I was adopted as a baby. She and my dad agreed on a first name, and my mother used her mother's maiden name (last name she has before getting married). That means, my middle name was her grandmother's last name. I didn't like the name much but I didn't think too much about it. Then my mother tells me how abusive and mean her grandmother was to her; the same person who's last name is my middle name. So, when I got married, I dropped that name and gave myself a new middle name. My mother was very disappointed and hurt, but it's my name and I don't want to be associated with an abusive relative. Pretty much everyone on my mother's side was mad at me for changing it and accused me of hurting my mom on purpose.My grandmother/mom's mother was a good person, but I didn't appreciate the assiciation with her maiden name. I even asked my mother if she wanted to honor her mother, why didn't she use her first name. I may not have changed it when I got married if that was the case. She said she didn't know.", "NTA\n\nShe knew what she was doing. \n\nIf you choose to do something like this you have to be prepared for backlash. \n\nHer goal was to not tell anyone until after the baby was born because in her deluded mind everyone would compliment her.

We ended up at a standoff and she was like that's no way to speak to a newly post partum mom.
