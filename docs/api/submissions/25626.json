Why not name her son after y\u2019all\u2019s dad? You know the man who actually stuck it out and raised his children? Is calling names ever nice? No. But sometimes people need a slap in the face to realize just how out of touch they\u2019re really being. And also, being called dumb by her brother is probably a hell of a lot easier of a blow to take than hearing what y\u2019all\u2019s dad probably truly thinks and feels on the inside.
