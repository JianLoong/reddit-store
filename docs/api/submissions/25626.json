The reason I think I went too far and made myself an asshole is I really went hard on her when she had only given birth a couple of days before that. I know post partum is hard on the person who has given birth and that a couple of days is not enough time to be fully back to normal.

Your sister is crossing some major boundaries here, not because she named her son after your grandfather, but because she directly confronted your dad about it.
