I usually do desserts for friends and family, and also occasionally bring stuff to the office to share with my coworkers. This past weekend was my friend's birthday, so she decided to celebrate it Monday since a lot of us had off work on Memorial Day. As a gift to her, on Sunday night I made a delicious, 4-layer chocolate cake with chocolate frosting to bring to her party. She was super appreciative and loved the cake. I realized I had a lot of excess frosting after finishing making her cake, so I made a second, smaller, 2-layer cake to bring to the office on Tuesday (yesterday) as a fun surprise. My coworkers seemed excited about the cake and many thanked me, and I decided to cut it up around lunchtime to serve to people.\n\nAs I was cutting up the cake, one of my coworkers (40s? M) said, \"You really need to work on your piping work with the frosting. It just looks a little sloppy.\" Now I'll be honest, the cake *did* look a bit sloppy. I was really only making it to use up the excess frosting leftover from my friend's cake, so I did run out when I was piping a border around the edge of the cake. But I was also really annoyed because I went out of my way to make a cake just to be nice for my coworkers, and he felt he had to critique my work? It's not like I'm a contestant on Great British Bake Off here! It's also not like the cake was disgusting or poorly slapped together, it still tasted fine and just looked like an amateur cake, and I still put a lot of effort into it.\n\nAnyways, I responded by saying, \"Alright, then don't have any\", and didn't hand him a piece. I realize I probably came off rude here, and he looked a little shocked and walked away. Later that day, I got a warning from our HR rep about being rude and not bringing baked goods in if I wasn't going to let certain people have any, so I guess he went to HR about it. I'll probably talk to HR about it later today and try to clear the air but I don't know if I'm at fault and should apologize or if his comment was unwarranted.

Hopefully HR sees that.\n\nIt's possible that his comment was a neg gone awry, in which case good riddance.", "Funnily enough, some people will do just that. I worked with someone who did in fact go to HR over not being invited to another employee\u2019s yearly pool party despite the fact that neither one of them got along at all and not everyone in the office was invited - just the people that were friends outside of the office and their families. If they were specifically held as team building events, i could understand feeling left out. But they were literally just parties that this lady threw for her friends and family every year and invited some of us to, as well. Thankfully our HR just told the complainer to get over it, that they can\u2019t force everyone to be her friend.", "According to the post OP said \u201cwell don\u2019t have any then\u201d not the he couldn\u2019t have any. OP didn\u2019t hand him a slice sure but she didn\u2019t specifically say he couldn\u2019t eat any. \n\nTo me saying \u201cdon\u2019t have any then\u201d is quite a flippant response, and gave him ample opportunity to realise he\u2019d been a dick and backtrack. Instead he went to HR", "True, killing them with kindness does always work better. I also would\u2019ve gone that route instead of showing visible anger. But it could\u2019ve just been in the heat of the moment, depending on the tone in which he\u2019d said it and the amount of people present, we just don\u2019t know.", "Meh, it takes way more to create a hostile work environment, at least if you\u2019re in the US.", "That's not what a hostile work environment means.", "That's the point. Let him go back to HR to start digging his own grave as the unnecessary complainer so they stop treating his childish complaints as actual legitimate grievances."]}
