For context we only met the woman once when she showed up uninvited to my birthday party unannounced, and it really rubbed my mom the wrong way.

He should be the one doing something for her.", "Dude! What's wrong with your sister? She sounds immature, spoiled, and narcissistic. All of you should be focused on your mom's happiness that day. You're not the asshole. Your sister is.", "NTA. It\u2019s really sweet that your sister wants to make Mother\u2019s Day special for her MIL too, but asking you to share in that is unfair, and it\u2019s very fair of you to see that, if it\u2019s a joint gift from you and your sister, it should only extend to people you BOTH feel that sort of attachment to.", "NTA  \nYour sister is making no sense and is guaranteeing the event would be a failure.  Your mother would not want this woman there, everyone is saying that. The whole brunch would be awkward making it uncomfortable for everyone. How is that a gift to either woman? Not to mention her bf wouldn't be there so how would this be from him? \n\nSounds like your sister (or her bf)  are being cheap and trying to do glom onto your mother's lunch to save a few bucks. Was she going to make OP pay part of bf's mother's meal too?", "NTA. You're right. This is a gift for your mom, so if your mom would be turned off by it, it's not a good idea to invite her. Why can't your sister celebrate her bf's mom on another day?", "NTA. If she wants to do something for her boyfriend\u2019s mom then maybe she should plan something for her? Mother\u2019s Day is a whole day. Why can\u2019t she plan a separate special thing?", "NTA this isn't about BF's mom, it's about yours. And the BF isn't even coming!

This is not simply a girl\u2019s brunch, but one to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day. Your sister\u2019s bf can take his mom out, or the 3 of them can do something later in the day.", "NTA. Why cant she and her BF do something separate for his mother? Celebrate your mom at brunch first and then take her BF's mom out to dinner?\n\nIt's weird and awkward if your mom doesn't know her and doesn't have a relationship with her. Your sister is trying to make it easier on herself but it may rub your mom the wrong way.", "NTA - I wouldn't want to celebrate Mother's Day with another Mom I don't know.

Your sister is being selfish and not at all thinking of what your mom might enjoy. NTA but your sister is.

This is a gift for your mom and is all about your mom on Mother's Day, not about her boyfriend's mom.  This would offend nearly every woman I know when celebrating Mother's Day.  2.  They are not trying to do something special for his mom.  They are trying to hijack your plans and pretend that it is their gift to his mom.  They need to make their own plans for his mom.

There is also dinner. They can go out for dinner the three of them.", "She is young, in love (early in the relationship), hard working, and stubborn.

If you want to do something special for your BF's mom, then do something special that is also* ***separate.***", "This is the explanation I needed at the time during the conversation, and words failed me. The only thing I could say at the time is none of us were bringing our partners or their mothers and her reasoning was \u201cyeah but other sister has never even met his mom and you don\u2019t like your partners mom and that\u2019s not my problem\u201d. She already was ready to fight back about how it was my problem, and not accepting of the fact that it was weird for multiple reasons.", "His mother already takes advantage of my sister as well, and makes her pay rent and treats her like a minion to get stuff done that the mother \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d do or afford (even though she is sitting on a lot of money, but that is another story). My sister already goes above and beyond for this woman. She shouldn\u2019t have to crash our Mother\u2019s Day. My sister shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not inviting her. Something about this feels weirder now that I\u2019ve thought further along this line\u2026.", "I even told her to ask my dad what his opinion would be, as to further prove the point, and that\u2019s when she decided she just was not going at all then. This makes it even more awkward, and almost ensures that the nice plans I had are now not going to work and make everything more awkward too.", "We weren\u2019t planning to do this on Mother\u2019s Day either, it is for a later date which is why we were trying to put reservations together. She asked me as I was planning reservations if she could add her boyfriend\u2019s mom in and got hostile with me when I said it might be weird. This was being planned as a group present, and quality bonding time thing. My family has some issues (like most families do), and I was trying my best to make it a special moment for the 4 of us.", "As much as I agree I don\u2019t want to cut her out because I love her and want her there. We are closer than I am to really even my mom and my other sister which is why this extra sucks. I know I\u2019m not going to enjoy time without her there because the dynamic tends to be on the toxic side if she is not there too.", "I\u2019m willing to pick up extra expense for her as my sister or for my mom as my mom, but I\u2019m not willing to fork out extra for her boyfriend\u2019s mom because I can barely afford this in general, but I want my mom to have a good experience for once because I\u2019m not the best at showing that I care through anything but acts of service.", "I hardly know them at all, and my sister and the boyfriend have only been together 6 months. On my birthday, which was Easter weekend, my sister showed up with her whole boyfriend\u2019s family in tow  knowing that it was an issue (she apologized to my mom and basically told her she knew it would be a problem for us, but that basically it would be uncomfortable to tell them no), and it was awkward and uncomfortable, and his entire family came off as rude and distasteful the entire encounter. I know they left a bad taste in my mom\u2019s mouth already, but I can\u2019t tell my sister that strictly based on this alone her coming is not a good idea.", "Oh yikes I would flip out if she ended up doing that. Guess I\u2019m going to need to talk about boundaries when/if it comes time to plan a wedding. I never would have thought about this!", "We\u2019re doing this after Mother\u2019s Day so it should be even less of an issue.", "But she's not over compensating or being hard-working. She's coming off as cheap and lazy. Inviting this woman to your mother's lunch sounds like she doesn't want to bother thinking of something to do for this woman and your sister and her bf are trying to avoid having to pay for the 3 of them to go out.", "Excuses, excuses, excuses. She's a goddamned adult who should know by now she's not the center of the universe, nor do her needs automatically come first.", "Do something for her, specifically for her, with something you planned for her. Exactly.", "I think your sister probably thinks (most likely subconsciously) that because she\u2019s proposing doing something so altruistic (she is), that should *automatically* trump other people\u2019s personal reservations (it shouldn\u2019t).\n\nIf you want to talk her round, I\u2019d suggest praising to the skies her desire to make her MIL special - but saying that, since it\u2019s a *joint* Mother\u2019s Day gift, you only want to include people that you *both* see as a mother figure", "You said in another comment that she is early in the relationship, keep an eye on this situation. It kinda feels like they are taking advantage of her since she is young and doesn't know any better. The fact that she is already doing the whole \"if she can't come, I won't come either\" feels like they are trying to cause a rift so they can alienate her from your family.", "does your sister live with bf and his mom? If this is a new relationship and they are already using her like this then I'd be very concerned. Are your parents aware of this?", "Why does her boyfriend tolerate his mother treating your sister like this?", "I hear ya. Paying for family and loved ones is one thing, virtual strangers quite another.", "There. \nAnd having 3 daughters (still to young to invite me for bunch) I looove the idea of sisters mother brunch.", "Worse than that. His sister is being an insensitive, narcissistic, asshole. There. I said it again. She needs to grow up and realize what she wants doesn't always count.", "I did praise her for wanting to include her and do something nice for her. I kind of had this thought right here after she got mad when I told her I thought it was weird after she asked me about it. I sensed the defensiveness and immediately switched to oh no, I know she thinks she is trying to do something nice how do I solve this mode. It\u2019s a really hard position to be in.", "Thank you for saying this. I always get told that I\u2019m paranoid, but I\u2019m autistic and pick up on patterns like this in behaviors and my red flags start becoming a field of red flags and everyone always acts like I\u2019m overreacting until the exact scenario I warned them about unfolded exactly how I said it would and then they\u2019re upset that I was right. I try to avoid issues like this with my family for this reason, as there is constant interpersonal issues that ripple through our family.", "They have been dating about six months and she moved in with him as they started dating. Their family has several big red flags, but we can\u2019t talk to her without her getting defensive and basically cutting us out for an unknown period of time because she\u2019s mad or upset with us for getting involved in her business. Which to an extent I understand, but now we are at the point where none of us bother unless it is something we know NEEDS to be said for her safety or well being, and can live with her being mad at us over.", "I hate to say it, but when you get raised in a home that normalizes it, you don\u2019t always recognize bad behavior. \nHis home life from only the little they have shared with me is horrific. I\u2019m not sure why either of them would subject themselves to the bullshit, or excuse it as \u201cthat\u2019s just how she is\u201d. I couldn\u2019t do it.", "I thought it would be a really nice idea to get dressed up and have a fun brunch with them. We only really get along in a group setting too, so it would have been a refreshing moment. Things have been testy between the 4 of us over the past couple years. I just wanted one nice brunch where everything went right.", "Have you asked her how she\u2019d feel in your shoes? You\u2019re planning a really nice Mother\u2019s Day gift for your mum, but now you\u2019re told you have to include someone in it who isn\u2019t a mother figure to you? How is it a special thing for your mum that you\u2019re doing solely because she\u2019s your mum, if you have to include someone on the same pedestal that you\u2019ve only met once?", "I tried but she got mad and walked off. She\u2019s still currently not speaking to me.", "Baby sister can attend the brunch with the family and do something special later for bf's mom. Besides, despite her history of showing up uninvited to other family gatherings, the bf's mom may feel out of place at a brunch that's clearly intended for a mom and her children. NTA.", "I know my sister barely has the money to afford to go to this restaurant on her own, so that was a concern of mine as well. I'm not exactly well off, and have saved a little extra cash and want to do something nice for us as a family. Now I feel like my plans have been ruined.", "I suspect that line is straight from the BF's mom's mouth, and that she uses it to manipulate her son and OP's sister.", "The BF's family looks pushy and less than nice.\n\nCan we be sure this wasn't the BF's mom who guilt tripped your sister by saying \"ooh, poor me, nobody ever does things like that for me\" after she heard your sister talk about your plans for your mother?", "No, my sister tried to tack it on at the very end of planning while in the same room as me. We had run the idea passed a few days prior, so maybe her boyfriend suggested it? Or maybe she was doing it on her own ambition. I'm not entirely sure. But, either way, she's not someone that was included in the original plan at all regardless."]}
