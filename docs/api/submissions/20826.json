His is a \"man-cave\" it's got a bar, a pool table, a TV and some recliners it's spacious so he always invites his friends over for game night and they just hang out down there. My special room is an indoor pool that has a sunroof so that's where I usually go to unwind. The other day  my husband and his friends went in there while I was gone and left the place untidy, like beer bottles/empty sweets and chip packets on the floor and used my egytian cotton towels and then just left them lying on the floor. I wouldn't have been as angry if they had cleaned up after themselves but they didn't my husband thinks I'm being unreasonable by getting myself so worked up about a mess even though I never go into his personal room and let alone trash the whole place. It's been two days but I'm still angry and he doesn't seem to get what the big deal is since the room has already been cleaned. I've since told him to stay out of there and if him or friends want to swim so badly they can just use the outdoor pool and now he's not talking to me and it's making me feel like I may have overreacted.\n\n\nEdit : it seems like most of you completely disregarded the whole point of my post and are instead focusing on how much money a person has.
