It was sudden, traumatic and I\u2019ve been grieving pretty hard about it. Right after she passed away I texted my ex (who\u2019s cat it initially was) that she died suddenly and that I was sorry. My husband saw the text and completely blew up at me saying I disrespected him by sending the text. I told him that I\u2019d want for him to tell me if my cat died and don\u2019t really understand why he was so upset. My cat died. I\u2019m not talking to the ex. I just sent a single text letting him know she died. He didn\u2019t even respond. AITA?\n\nFor some background I had two cats with this ex boyfriend years before I was married. During our breakup I just took both cats so they could stay together. My husband really doesn\u2019t even like cats. I don\u2019t think he really understand how sad I\u2019ve been. He also hasn\u2019t been supportive much. I had to even take a day off work because I was crying randomly.

And I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nWithout seeing the text, we can\u2019t know if, in your grief, you might have worded it poorly - that would be understandable, if true.  But the bare fact of sending him a text to notify him is absolutely NOT disrespectful - it\u2019s a courtesy, for heaven\u2019s sake! - and if he knows you at all, he should understand how shattered you are right now and not be looking for nits to pick.\n\nBest wishes to you.", "NTA. Do you feel safe?", "NTA - I am sorry for your loss. You cat meant a lot to you and your husband doesn\u2019t understand this. At this point he needs to get over his jealousy. \n\nYour ex didn\u2019t respond, so probably not worth texting him in the future about anything.", "Your husband is TA. WOW. Leave his uncaring bullshit behind and find someone who cares about you.", "NTA- divorce him he sounds awful", "NTA, where did you find this parahusband?", "NTA - Your husband should have been more understanding and supportive during this difficult time. Losing a beloved pet is heartbreaking and it's only natural that you would want to share that news with someone who was once a part of their life. Your actions were not disrespectful at all.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry your cat died! That is such a hard thing to live through and sometimes we don\u2019t give ourselves enough grace when it happens because it\u2019s \u201cjust an animal\u201d. I really hope you get some time to grieve and some loving support from people around you soon. It\u2019s normal that you wanted to tell your ex that his pet passed away. My ex reached out to me to tell me when our cat died, and so did my husband\u2019s ex when their dog died! It was the right thing to do, because he deserved to know. \n\nAs for hubs, that stinks. Some people are really rotten about this kind of thing. My ex was the same sometimes and wanted me to be fully no-contact with everyone I\u2019d ever dated. I think it\u2019s a bit controlling. It\u2019s normal to worry that your partner might hurt you emotionally, but it\u2019s not normal to control who they can talk to in order to quell that worry. My husband is not controlling in this way, thank God. We are friends with one of my exes actually, and love him very much! It helps that he trusts me, I think, but a big part of it is that he\u2019s not so self conscious: he knows that controlling who I may or may not speak to isn\u2019t an avenue to trusting me or feeling secure in our relationship. We have to trust each other face to all kinds of things (conversations with exes, new jobs around new people, going to a bar, etc.). We have to build those things independently! I hope this helps. I know it\u2019s kind of just a relay of my experience but I wanted to express that what your husband is doing seems kind of controlling, and that he might be doing it because his self esteem isn\u2019t as strong as it could be. He may be a wonderful husband in every other way! So it\u2019s worth talking to him about. Try to be understanding of his feelings that caused him to reach for controlling behaviour, but have a frank conversation about whether you both think that kind of thing is appropriate (e.g., would he be okay if you stopped him from having female friends if that made you worry he might cheat, for example?) You could chat about the different between healthy boundaries (maybe \u201cplease let me know before you text your ex so I\u2019m not surprised by it\u201d) vs coercive controlling boundaries (\u201cyou can\u2019t talk to that person at all, and if you do it\u2019s disrespectful to me\u201d). Wishing you the very best! I hope this works out. It\u2019s sticky stuff for sure but people persevere much!", "Hold on, your husband thinks you disrespected the ex that should know about the cat, or you disrespected him, the husband, by texting your ex at all? Sounds like the husband needs to chill because you are NTA for letting someone know about the passing of their furry friend.

You did the decent thing by letting your ex know about the cat. As long as that's all the text was, sounds like a big overreaction from your partner. If you were reaching out to the ex to look for comfort, that would be wrong.", "NTA.  Hmmm, sounds to me like your hubby disrespected YOU instead and didn't acknowledge your loss.  Why wouldn't you have told your ex?  He didn't respond anyhow so is a moot point.  Hubby needs to grow up.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Your husband sounds insecure or controlling, or both. Contacting your ex has nothing to do with him and I can\u2019t see how it could disrespect him.", "You \"disrespected\" your husband by telling your cat's former owner that she passed away?? What??? He sounds like a massive jerk. But, you factor that in with \"he doesn't like cats\" and how distant he's been, I'm sorry to say I'd suspect *he's* the reason kitty died suddenly.\n\nI'm so sorry about your cat.

I have no idea why she died\u2026 she was only 6 years old. It was sudden, traumatic and I\u2019ve been grieving pretty hard about it. Right after she passed away I texted my ex (who\u2019s cat it initially was) that she died suddenly and that I was sorry.

This smells like an impending divorce.", "NTA. Your husband is an AH. You did the right thing.", "NTA.  You did nothing wrong. Sorry to hear about your cat.", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nYou're NTA but your husband is. Hw doesn't have to like cats to understand how you feel. I assume he can both see and hear so he can hear you crying and see you're sad. That's all it should take for him to be there for you and comfort you. Instead he chose to pick a fight about you texting your ex. Even if he wasn't comfortable with you texting your ex, a person that cared would've waited to address it or simply said they'd prefer you didn't text your ex or maybe let him know if your ex responds before you respond.\n\nIf this isn't the 1st time your husband hasn't been understanding or supportive, and you often find yourself excusing away incidents like this, you should probably rethink your marriage. Men can sometimes be oblivious to why their wife is upset or feeling hurt about some things, but this isn't 1 of those situations. You don't have to lose a child or even be a parent to understand that losing a child is devastating. \n\nThe same applies here. He doesn't have to like cats or even ever had a pet to know losing a pet like a cat or dog hurts. He's not even saying he thinks you're grieving too long. I'm not sure how long you've been married, but you might want to get out before you have kids. How would he deal with a crying baby? \n\nToddlers have multiple meltdowns a day for just about any reason. They're finally able to have some control and think everything should go the way they want it to go. That kinda sounds like what you just experienced with your husband. Imagine your toddler outgrowing that phase and your husband never does.", "perfect", "Thank you, I think this is what I needed to hear.", "I disrespected him (my husband) by contacting my ex to notify him the cat passed away.", "So she was at the vet recently for shots and everything was fine. She stopped eating for a day. Thought maybe she didn\u2019t like the food to be honest..? I really don\u2019t know. Then I came home from work and couldn\u2019t find her. She was laying in the litter box. It was pretty sudden and unexpected as she just died so maybe she had cancer or ate something she shouldn\u2019t have. My other cat is completely fine.", "That\u2019s a terribly big red flag\u2026 I hope this isn\u2019t a common theme in the marriage.", "i\u2019m sorry. \n\nnta. your husband sounds controlling, and he sounds jealous. he doesn\u2019t decide who you talk to, and blowing up at you and telling you that you disrespected him by talking to someone is completely unacceptable."]}
