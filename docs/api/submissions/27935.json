He has done his duty. At a certain point you've got to take care of yourself.\n\nYou say you've been to the doctor, but I encourage you to go get a second and third opinion. This is not normal at all, or you have an extremely low pain tolerance. Either way, you've got to get a handle on this.", "YTA, you are being dependent on him and that's borderline u healthy. It's okay to want to be comforted, but as you've said he's been over multiple times a week, still managed to drop your food off anf will be back again today.

This is not normal for periods.\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. You want someone to suffer with you, and boyfriend or husband or life partner, that's not okay to shove onto someone else. You're, unfortunately, suffering. What exactly do you want them to do except be there to watch you? They can't make the pain go away. They can't really distract you much either from that kind of pain. You're debilitated. What exactly is he supposed to do? He brought you food. He's not your monkey to ask to dance to entertain/distract you. Watching you scream and writhe in pain is NOT fun for him. It wouldn't be pleasant for anyone to witness. So yeah, find something else to do during shitty periods. And yes, I know how bad they can get. I've been there. I collapsed on the sidewalk and had to get driven to a hospital for meds. It sucks. And when there's 'nothing wrong they can see', that also means there's nothing you can do except for dope yourself up and sleep through the worst of it. I suggest doing that.", "YTA\n\nYou need to learn how to rely on yourself or others and stop being so dependent on your bf. He was over there every single day during the week which is totally sufficient.\n\nHe even dropped off food and you still whined and threw a fit. Get your shit together.", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like he's meeting you halfway, and you're upset he isn't giving you more. He can't drop everything for a week every time you have a bad period; it's unreasonable to expect anything more than what he's giving you.\n\nAlso, if you're this debilitated, I have a really hard time thinking that there is not a medical issue going on.", ">I generally just cross my fingers for a good period because I'm scared of the side effects of birth control.\n\n\nYou don't get to be upset about people not catering to your discomfort when you refuse to get (a very common and well studied) treatment.

Do you expect him to just be sitting around doing nothing in his life and wait for your call whenever you need something? \n\nHaving him have to give up time with his friends and family once in a while for emergencies is fine. But it sounds like you expect this to be an everyday thing. For the times you are feeling well, do you go to him and show him support or is the relationship always as unfair and unequal as it is now?", "YTA for refusing medication that could fix the issue.", "YTA you're a grownass woman, you don't need a babysitter 24/7.", "YTA\n\nYou already know that you can do something about this which is to go on birth control.  Work with the doctors to ensure any side effects aren't as bad as you think but surely none of them could be worse than what you are experiencing at the moment.  \n\nI understand the pain can be debilitating but not willing to do something about it shouldn't make it your boyfriend's problem.", "YTA. You need to look after yourself. He has a life and he can\u2019t drop it 7 days a month to look after you. If your periods are this severe you need to go to a doctor if you haven\u2019t already. And get on blimmin birth control.", "This has to be fake. Maybe grow up a little...or a lot.

I suffer from a condition that makes ovulation and periods horrendously painful. The pain is one thing but the mental exhaustion and hormones can make you feel very isolated and mess with your head.\n\nThat being said, it isn't fair of you to expect your boyfriend, who sounds otherwise extremely supportive, to neglect the rest of his social circle. He made sure you had food and had already spent a large portion of his week with you. He even said he would return after the party. He hasn't done anything wrong and shouldn't be made to feel guilty for having time for himself.\n\n I think it would do you a lot of good to discuss some treatments with your doctor. I know you are wary of birth control but surely it might be worth considering if the alternative is being in so much pain you can't complete daily tasks? Personally, my life has completely turned around since I found the right birth control. I know it's a personal decision though and one solution doesn't fit all.", "I feel like it is your pain and hormones talking. Looks like your BF actually makes effort to spend some time with you and help you out and you can't expect him to drop everything he's doing because of your period. So very gentle YTA, though I understand you and that your pain can mess with your head right now. Stay strong and really do consider BC. Talk to your doctor about your fear, because side effects will most likely be a lot better than what you're going through right now.", "I\u2019m going with YTA but really it\u2019s a toss up. You have a serious medical issue that you have a responsibility to see about. A period is going to be a part of your life for about 40 more years. You need to see a specialist about this condition.  (FYI, don\u2019t expect a man to understand or take care of you. It\u2019s possible there is one out there that might, but not likely).", "Mild YTA. What would you do if you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend? You\u2019d get groceries/ food delivered and manage alone. You need to be a bit more grown up about this. But please get more medical opinions to try to find out what the problem is.", "YTA \n\nGet a better doctor \n\nGet better coping mechanisms \n\nIt's a period. People  go through cancer alone ffs", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t have a boyfriend you would have had to deal with it by yourself.", "YTA. You are 27. Stop acting like a child who needs a constant babysitter. Get your shit together before he dumps your ungrateful ass", "YTA  You seem to refuse to do anything to help your situation. There's way more involved in painful periods than abnormal ovaries. You're scared of the side effects of birth control, you say. Have you spoken to a doctor about your fears? There are lots of different options out there, one of them is probably right for you. Your boyfriend is allowed to have a life. He shouldn't have to abandon everything one week a month to nurse you.", "What exactly did you expect him to do? If you are taking pain relievers like Midol and are still screaming in pain, you need to go back to the doctor. Your boyfriend cannot fix this for you. If on the other hand, you have something called- pay-attention-to-me-ittus, then YTA.", "HF, OP. Download a food delivery app, get a heating pad, and some ibuprofen with methocarbol (brand name robax). There\u2019s no need to suffer like this. I\u2019ve got a polyp, a cyst, and a fibroid. Every period is awful, so pain control is everything. Waiting until you\u2019re in agony to take pain meds makes it only that much harder to control. You\u2019re hormonal AF, and asking way too much from a BF. YTA.", "YTA. You can drive.", "Nta for being upset and crying because periods can be wild however I'm trying to find a nice way to say this (but as another woman who has had pretty painful periods on and off for as long as ive had periods).. it hurts and that sucks but your boyfriend has already done more that my partner of 10 years. Your a full grown woman so do yourself a favour and don't rely on men to take care of you for a week a month. I promise you can deal with it on your own if he won't help \u2665\ufe0f", "I'm sorry for your pain, but screaming and crying at your boyfriend for not taking care of you is unbelievably obnoxious!

He\u2019s been trying to support you well so I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing anything wrong. And I think you\u2019re this upset because of your fluctuating hormones, it\u2019s understandable that being on your period, you\u2019re more emotional, but you should also realise that you\u2019re emotional right now and may have a different view of the situation than if you were off your period.", "Neither of you is thinking very much about the other.  But he's told you his boundaries - he doesn't want to be relied on to play nurse when you're sick. Did you really expect anyone to hang out with you while you feel like shit though?", "I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re having such a rough time!\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting the person you love to be with you when you\u2019re in pain, and I can see why you\u2019d feel abandoned. \n\nI think you should have a calm conversation with him at a neutral time, when you\u2019re feeling better. Does it freak him out to see you in distress? Is it a relatively new relationship? Does he need more space than you do? Does he have a pattern of tapping out when you\u2019re struggling or things get a little intense? Does he feel guilt tripped? \n\nYou need to understand what he\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt makes me upset and I don\u2019t know what to do when I see you in pain\u201d or \u201cthis is all more intense than I\u2019m ready for\u201d are very different than \u201cdon\u2019t trouble me with your problems, you baby\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for crying, especially in a moment of pain and vulnerability.\n\nEdit: I think it\u2019s worth trying birth control. Trying it doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay on it forever if it doesn\u2019t work or the side effects are too much.", "NAH. I know you feel upset and abandoned, and I can certainly see why you feel that way. Sometimes when you're in debilitating pain, all you want is someone to take care of you, and that doesn't stop when you're an adult. \n\nYes, while you should be able to do things for yourself, it's okay to lean on your partner sometimes and ask for help. People here act like wanting to be babied is the worst thing you could possibly do, but like, sometimes that's what you need when you're in pain. However, your boyfriend did his best, and it seems like he did a really lovely job, so he's definitely not wrong here. \n\nAlso, I just want to say, OP, a lot of comments I've read are horrible and insulting, and I hope you don't take those words to heart. People can make bad choices when they're in pain, and sometimes they have unrealistic expectations that people just can't live up to. You can't really control how you feel, and periods are kind of crap with the hormones and emotions. (Can't tell  you how many times I've cried over nothing on my period). So maybe wait until you're better to discuss this further\u2014it'll probably be a lot easier and go a lot further.\n\n I would also consider looking into different options to manage your bad periods, because they sound *awful*. Maybe discuss your fears with your doctor, so you can figure out a plan that works for you?", "It\u2019s ok to have a girlfriend for sex but obviously not for a relationship.\n\nGet out of there! \n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
