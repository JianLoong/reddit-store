I was young and dumb and not aware that more medications than just antibiotics could render birth control less effective. My neurologist and OB knew my meds and BC but hadn\u2019t informed me of any instructions and I stupidly never looked into it myself. However, my (ex) fianc\u00e9 and I were both in college and also employed. It wasn\u2019t an \u201ceasy\u201d situation (what teen pregnancy is?) but we had the means to do it on our own.
