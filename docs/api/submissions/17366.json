I'm her only child. But she has been a stepmom to my half siblings for 20 years now. My half siblings mom died and our dad met my mom 3 years after and they got married. My half siblings hate my mom. She always deluded herself into believing she is their mother and that they care about her. I remember her always trying to reach them and being rejected, sometimes harshly and sometimes they just ignored her. Both my half sister and half brother are married with babies now. Neither of them invited mom or me to their weddings. Dad got a solo invite and didn't go. My mom has never actually met their babies. She sent them each a package when their firsts were born and they were promptly sent back with the stuff destroyed.\n\nI asked mom not to make Mother's Day plans so I could plan something and she agreed. Mother's Day came and she was gone before I woke up. I couldn't get through to her on the phone. At like noon my dad said his son had called and she had shown up at my half siblings houses, trying to spend the day with them and trying to show that they still had a mother on Mother's Day. They kicked her out but stayed the whole day. I had spent money on a couple of mom's favorite places to make sure we could go and I lost that. I had both a bought and hand made gift that were left sitting there too. By the time it got to 4pm I tore the wrapping off the gift I bought, found the receipt and decided to return it yesterday after school. I got more and more mad and she finally got home at like 8pm and I asked her where she'd been and she told men she was showing her older kids and grandkids that she loved them and was there.\n\nI asked her how many times she had to be told she was not their mom or their kids' grandmother for her to get it. She told me I couldn't possibly understand at 16. I asked her about the stuff I had planned and she told me it was no big deal and I could give her the gifts. But that she needed to be there for her older babies and it was just a homemade dinner I had planned for her. I told her it wasn't, told her all about the stuff I had planned for her, and she told me to rebook and we'd try to get my siblings involved and make it a real celebration. I told her she had a child who loved and wanted to celebrate her and instead she went chasing after two grown adults who never wanted a thing to do with her. She told me she never planned to spend the day with me and was always going to seek out her other children. I tossed the gift I made into the fire in front of her and she told me I was being so childish and I had to share her rather than being a spoiled selfish \"little madam\". I told her she's going to end up bitter and lonely one day and I won't be there when it finally sinks in that my half siblings will never accept her. I told her I'm not going to be anyone's consolation prize.\n\nMom yelled at me for the disrespect and she and dad told me I was out of line yesterday.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684217078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iwoqt/aita_for_telling_my_my_mom_shes_going_to_turn/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Emotionally, I\u2019d cut your losses now, because she\u2019s not going to change.", "NTA\n\n> She told me I couldn't possibly understand at 16.\n\nI am 60. You understand perfectly. She is the one who doesn't get it. This sub is *swamped* with kids (and adult kids) who have suffered from step parents trying to enforce family intimacy.", "NTA.

You were great and I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself so she knows that is not acceptable to put you in second place. She made a commitment to you and then for some strange reason decided to go off the rails.  That\u2019s unacceptable. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how you were out of line, yes, you threw her gift I\u2019m the fire, but you hadn\u2019t given it to her yet so it was still yours to do with what you wanted.

But you are very mature for your age. You are a very level-headed girl.\n\nWork hard and get away when you can. Build a life for yourself, and seek therapy if you have to. My guess is when you move out your mom will try to pull the same BS that she is doing now- so it is best to cut contact with someone who clearly doesn't want to get better.", "NTA Your mom is the one out of line.

You put in a lot of effort for someone who puts no effort for you.\n\nI know at this point you are dependent on your folks and mother and have to remain under their roof.

And nobody would blame you if you went no contact.", "NTA. You went out of your way to plan something nice and get her a nice gift.  \nI think  your mother might have had dreams when she married your father  concerning your elder half siblings and has a hard time letting it go.\n\nStill, she went too far . She has a child at home who loves her and she can't see that love as she's hellbent on getting accepted as a mother of people who want nothing to do with her, maybe because of her behaviour.\n\nYour feelings are valid and you are, as you say, not a consolation prize. It worries me though that your mother can't see that the hurt your half siblings put her through with them ignoring her, she inflicts onto you by doing the same. She's being discarded by them and she passes it down.\n\n  \nShe needs therapy as well as you  with her and  your dad together.\n\n@ mom of OP in case she reads this.  \n I hurt for you. I'm sure that what you want is for them to feel your love. You want acknowledgement, you want/need love. That is valid, that's good.  \nThe way you have handled it may have been out of line in regards to respecting boundaries. I wasn't there.   \nYou showing up at their house last time when you were told not to do so, shows you don't have regards  or respect for those boundaries. Love is not forced. Sometimes loves need to grow and showing respect for boundaries is a part of that.", "wow, your mom really knows how to make sure she has NO ONE to help her when she's old huh.\n\nBOTH of your parents suck. Your dad for siding with your mom over his other kids, and for him siding with your mom over you.

Let her destroy her own life running after something she can never have. Let your dad go with her, because he obviously doesn't give 2 shits about any of his kids.", "NTA as you said your mother is delusional which I can clearly see and entitled. The irony she\u2019s trying to chase after two grown adults who want nothing to do with her while driving away someone who actually loves them despite their huge flaws. \n\nIf she\u2019s like this towards you there\u2019s clear reasons why your step siblings cut her off same I can see with your father. Let her figure out her flaws if she even can. It\u2019s best you consider doing similar when you eventually move out.", "NTA.\n\nIn trying to force herself into a relationship where she's clearly not wanted, she's basically destroyed the relationship she had with you. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but I think you're right.", "NTA, she obviously needs help. You don't deserve to be a consolation prize to your own mother. You weren't out of line. Your Mom needs to stop deluding herself and your dad needs to grow a spine.\nI would stop doing things for her.", "[removed]", "This one is difficult to rate, I'm going with ESH. You're 100% NTA for getting angry at her, but YTA big time for saying something so hurtful to a woman who's suffered constant sh!t behavior and bullying from her husband's children for longer than you've been alive.\nThere are details about your mother's relationship with you and your step siblings that we're not privy to (what's dad's role in the way his children treat you mom, for example?), but I think you, mom, and dad need to have a serious talk together, with no adolescent burning shit and yelling.\nEdited a typo.\n\nEdit: I know the consensus seems to be \"off with her head\", but I think some situations are more complex than that. You may downvote me to hell and back, but as much as I can relate to a turbulent relationship with a relatively toxic mother (boy, do I know), I also believe that everyone is hurting here and talking things (in and out of therapy) usually helps people in OP's situation more than hurting each other more and more.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it was never me she wanted.", "I can get therapy in a couple of years but I am not putting more energy into making my mom feel better when I'm not good enough for it.

All she wants is the two kids she cannot have.", "I suspect Mother Dearest is going to discover her back pocket has a hole.", "Yep grass is greener mentality", "Downside of that viewpoint is that she is taking daughter for granted and her love isn't guaranteed. My parents always chased after my sister because she was dramatic and they were scared they'd lose her so got pushed to back burner a lot. All that came to me as that I was taken for granted and she was the valued one. Realistically I was also the one more likely to walk away because all they teach you is to be emotionally distanced and independent of them. If they don't value your love, they dont value you so why keep investing to get hurt? \n\nMother seems both greedy and selfish in this case. She wants what she wants regardless of whatever anyone else wants. And the burden of \"sorting\" her isn't on OP- OP is a minor, she's not responsible for mending adults. But therapy for herself and maybe with her Dad, though he is a AH too for not seeing her pain, so she knows she is loved and valued by at least one parent.", "Really? That\u2019s your take?

Luckily his final years we had a great relationship and he also had a relationship with my children.  \n\nDon't be fooled it wasn't easy.  I did have to put him in place a few times.
