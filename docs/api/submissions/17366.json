She doesn\u2019t seem like a very kind and understanding person, so please remember you have every right to be extremely upset with her.

She will undoubtedly find something to complain about and some way to hurt you.  If you can, get away and distance yourself as soon as possible.  Get therapy.

Life can and will get better than this.\n\nI\u2019ve been estranged from my mother for years because she didn\u2019t want a daughter, she wanted a scapegoat, a servant, a dustbin to pour all her self hatred into, and a doll who would look pretty and reflect well on her.  She obsessed over things and other people too, and frankly she is exhausting.  No matter what I did, I was never ever good enough.\n\nLet your mother chase after other people who don\u2019t want her.  You are her child, not her parent.  You are not responsible for her emotions or her mental health.  Do you have friends with supportive parents, or a kind relative/counsellor/teacher you can speak to in confidence?\n\nNTA, and you were right.

She used to do this. Luckily, she got that under control. She still has the drive to do it and obsess about people but she recognizes why it is inappropriate and intrusive. She can't control the thoughts. But she can control her actions", "So the thing with OCD repeated actions isn't that they relieve anxiety, it's that your brain fools you into thinking that if you don't do the action (the technical term is 'ritual' so I'm gonna use that from now on) then a bad thing will happen. The action is part of that anxiety cycle. So I feel tap on certain surfaces a certain number of times in a certain way *specifically because* there's this insistent thought that people I love will be endangered if I don't. I don't want to make universal statements about people's mental health, but to the best of my knowledge this is the most common fear that your brain tries to make sense of OCD with - most if not all OCD rituals are done because the sufferer is scared that people will be hurt if they don't do the thing. Doing rituals is not a calming thing. My tapping ritual is so stressful I get dizzy doing it, and more and more scared as I do it. Sometimes in my desperation to do it I cause myself physical pain, but I do it because my brain (I know, irrationally) is convinced that it's the only way to keep people safe. People with OCD are less likely than average to harm other people, because it's a disorder that partly generates out of wanting other people to be safe.\n\nThis is turning into a long and complicated comment, sorry, but people actually understanding what OCD means is important to me. So another aspect of OCD is that it's a troll of a disorder because that perception of danger *isn't* a true delusion. You're aware the whole time that what you're doing is irrational. I know my tapping cannot have any link to people's safety. I don't want to do it. I hate being trapped by this disorder. And in a way that's very hard to describe to people not going through it, I still do it in the moment because there's an urgent sense of 'oh god quick do it anyway'. It's that 'lifting tree trunks off of cars' sort of urgent response to help whilst you are totally aware there are no tree trunks. I have really pretty bad OCD, and even with me if I can find some space to think about it, I will be able to stop myself - and/or that moment of fear/urgency exhausts itself in a matter of minutes and I'm left in a massive state but not doing the ritual anymore. It's true that doing the OCD ritual will mean I feel a little more like I've kept people safe, and that's how those brain patterns get reinforced, but that's both a really short-term cycle and doesn't leave me feeling un-anxious, it just temporarily resolves that false narrative. My point is that I don't see any way that such a multifaceted, premeditated and lengthy process as stalking could possibly be an OCD ritual; OCD rituals are in many ways just the visible trappings of a particular fear spike/cycle, something like stalking isn't the sort of the urgent, panic-spike-and-immediate-response, magical thinking action that OCD rituals axiomatically are. \n\nIt's a really scary, debilitating disorder to live with at its worst, and the focus of it is all inward - as far as I understand the neuroscience it's like your brain has developed an addiction to fear, and keeps cycling this loop of panic - which is why it's really important to me that people understand. People with OCD are not dangerous and they are not a fitting target for the butt of jokes (I know that's not what you were doing, just a side note levelled at all of the 'omg I'm so OCD' nonsense when people like neat desks).\n\nFinal little bit of explanation, because I suspect you're not actually that interested in all this? but it feels important to write anyway. So the washing hands stereotype is that's because a fear of 'contagion' is specifically really common in people with OCD. I'm pretty sure this is an extension of what happens in that gap between knowing something is irrational and doing it anyway: your brain tries to construct any chain of reasoning to explain why you should do the thing anyway. So as a little sci fi geek growing up, my brain offered up 'if you don't go round in this little circle again and again \\[my most common ritual at the time\\] then you won't end up in the right alternative universe and you'll get stuck specifically in an AU where your friends get hurt'. Like I said, I didn't believe that, I was aware of reality, but that was the stupid narrative my brain tried to justify why I felt like I had to do the thing. It's not my thing, but I can totally see the idea of harmful germs serving the same purpose linked to a ritual of washing hands. Hoarding is another mental health problem often comorbid with OCD because anxiety disorders rarely turn up alone. I could see that feeling like you have to eat a particular food might be a ritual, but I've never heard of it (doesn't mean it can't be) and I suspect probably the link is more likely to be that autistic people experience higher incidences of OCD and having safe foods *is* a common aspect of autism. People may often describe stalking celebrities as OCD, again I haven't seen it before now but I can believe they would, but that is stigma, it's wrong, it's not on the symptom list of OCD, it doesn't fit the profile or the emotional 'needs' of a ritual, and I suspect its basically lazy journalism where journalism is involved. Checking the NHS list of symptoms just now and my old psychology course textbooks just to make absolutely certain, it's not even on the list of comorbidities - although you are right that hoarding and eating disorders are. But again, these are different conditions that a person with OCD is often also at risk of having, not the same condition.\n\n**Honestly I think possibly the central tl;dr is that the anxiety/'relief' cycle that your describing is a waaaaaay more short-term situation than I think you're understanding it as. Like seconds to minutes, and one basic action that your brain has magically connected to preventing a scary outcome. And you know what you're doing is irrational, and - anecdotally - you're usually hyper-tuned in to whether what you're doing could be hurting people you love.**\n\nI agree that the mum here probably has some sort of mental health problem - she is definitely exhibiting stalking behaviour - but her underlying anxiety doesn't seem to be terror and sense of doom and danger so much as it's desperation to be loved or have a particular status. She's taking a variety of actions with a central aim - i.e. trying to get and keep in touch with them in a variety of ways - rather than repeating the same basic action again and again; and the action described here isn't a basic one, it's a lengthy, premeditated, composite process. And in many ways her behaviour is rationally connected to her desired outcome: talking to people to develop a relationship with them is a real process with a real cause and effect, the disordered part of her behaviour is that in this context it's socially completely inappropriate and threatening. OCD would be her to be touching a photo again and again to magically ward off fear of being unloved or something: OCD requires that magical thinking element. And like I said, people with OCD know what they're doing is irrational, and the mum seems not to. As far as I can see it just doesn't hit any of the hallmarks, other than there being anxiety the two are completely unrelated. \n\nJesus, long comment, sorry... gonna do something else with my day now. Hope the rest of your day is good despite this disagreement :)."]}
