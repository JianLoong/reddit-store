I work fulltime and pay for heating oil, property taxes, as well as pretty much whatever other money she asks from me (including a few hundred in rent each month, usually her phone, and any groceries we run out of before the end of the month). This weekend my sister and brother-in-law went on a getaway with some friends and dropped my niece (1) and nephew (5) off for my mom to watch them. My partner and I are going Christmas shopping today - we were going to last week but he had COVID, so I haven't seen him at all for two weeks. Since I told her of the plan, she has been noticeably upset with me and said \"It would be nice if you wanted to help\" and keeps making jabs about how I'll \"be gone all day\". I told her I was not going to feel bad or cancel my plans in favor of babysitting and she said I was being an asshole. This is not a new thing with her, babysitting or not; she often bemoans when I'm \"gone all day\" with my partner instead of staying home to help with whatever chores she wants, even when I inform her in advance of the plans - she will then decide that x or y gardening/cleaning/etc. MUST be done THE DAY I had plans. She also is noticeably upset that I'm going to my partner's family's for Christmas this year again because she'll be \"all alone\". Am I the asshole for sticking to plans with my partner instead of staying home to babysit?\n\nETA: inb4 the \"mOvE OuT\" comments, I am in the process of saving for a security deposit and just switched jobs to be closer to where I want to move to.\n\nETA 2: I am doing Christmas Eve with my partner's family and staying the night because it is a few hours away.

If moving out is not a possibility, then I suggest you talk to your mom about your expectations going forward\u2026and how she should get herself some hobbies.", "NTA. Your mother obviously either agreed to babysit her grandchildren, or she can chew it out with your sister who left them. I hope you find a way to move out soon.", "NTA. She has abandonment issues that's she's projecting on to you. You need to understand that it has absolutely nothing to do with whatever it is you're going to do instead or whatever task it is she wants you around for. It has to do with her fear of being alone. Frankly, she needs friends. She needs encouragement to get out more and socialize with others.\n\nIt might be nice to try to get her an X-mas invite to your partner's gathering. If there's cause for you not to, that's fine. But if there isn't I'd strongly consider doing so, especially as you transition more towards a joint family. That's totally an aside from the other drama. That's the only situation I'm seeing where her loneliness crosses over towards being reasonable. Broken clock being right twice a day sort of thing. And if your side of the family isn't doing anything special, inviting the solo person left out is simply a nice thing to do.\n\nEither way, don't let her guilt you into not living your life. This really isn't about you, it's about her. She needs to see a therapist to do a deep dive into her abandonment issues.", "NTA. Your mom agreed to babysit, you did not. You cannot be expected to help out if you don\u2019t want to. And your mom clearly has some issues with expecting you to be her companion and by her side whenever she decides that\u2019s what she needs or wants. That\u2019s not your burden to bear.", "NTA. She accepted the babysitting ask, not you and is now trying to guilt you into this. \n\nWith your mother, the lines are also getting blurred. If you\u2019re paying close to what a renter would pay, she shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate a chore schedule. Howe ever, if you are paying significantly less than a renter, I\u2019d have a conversation around her passive aggressiveness as this isn\u2019t sustainable for you.", "NTA\n\n\"When you stop treating us like the help and more like a family member, maybe we'll want to spend Christmas with you.\"", "No, definitely NTA.  However, you may want to consider building a nest egg to get out from your family.  The assholes are the people dumping their young children without A: asking in advance and B: compensation for their niblings care.\nFurther, your mom is an exceptional asshole since you are basically paying for the property without the title while demanding you do labor for her on top of your career to the detriment of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're a grown person who should be living on her own if that's what you want. I know that rental markets differ depending on location, but my last two apartments haven't required security deposits, just paying the first month (and a pet deposit, but if you're not moving with a pet that wouldn't apply). The tradeoff is a corporate landlord over a small one, usually. There are certainly pros and cons to that, but if you're looking to move and not in a tight rental market you might want to see if it's an option for you.  The last two places I've lived haven't been in tight rental markets, so if you're in a major city or outside of the US this might not apply.", "Nta", "NTA Mom should be encouraged to make friends with an eye toward potential hobby and travel companions.", "yta for leaving your mom alone on christmas when she is so kindly housing you for basically nothing. the least you could do is talk to your fianc\u00e9 about inviting her to his family gathering. for nearly 30 years shes supported you, thsts a hell of a way to repay her..", "then she needs to stop living at her moms house for basically free", ">basically nothing\n\nI pay her $500 in rent+her phone plus property taxes (300/month), heating fuel, and repairs that come up plus any extra groceries we run out of before the end of the month.
