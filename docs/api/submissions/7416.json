Ivana is very close cousin of mine, she is like my sister. \n\nIn our country, after church wedding is over, you go to bride, groom, best man and maid of honor, and wish them all good luck. It's like: you come up to them, say: Congratulations!, shake their hand and kiss them on the cheek if you want, and move to the side where you wait for that part to finish.\n\nWell, I congratulated and kissed Ivana, Phillip and MOH (31) on the cheek, as I knew them, but I skipped BM (34) and just shook his hand, as this is the first time I saw him.\n\nLater, all guests (about 200 of them) went to the dinner, we danced until 4 a.m., and most convos I had, was with my family that were seated at the same table as me.\n\nDay after wedding, I, my mom, grooms' mom and some of the bridesmaids came to wedding hall to pick up decorations and to clean it from confetti, baloons etc. I started to chat with one of the bridesmaids, Maya (30), Marcos' sister, and she said Marco felt uncomfortable by me congratulating him, because he felt I was into him, and his wife was there. I apologized for making him uncomfortable, said that he doesn't have to worry as he isn't my type, and brushed it off. She kept saying how he complained to her how I was giving him looks and how he felt I had a crush on him because my hands were warm when I was shaking his hand. (Of course my hands were warm, it was -3\u00b0C outside, and I was wearing a coat in a church with a heat on. If it wasn't a church, you could wear a tank top inside.) I said that he misunderstood it, it was just a traditional handshake and nothing more. I quickly finished what I was doing and went to help my mother as this convo creeped me out a bit.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I get a Facebook message from Marco, asking me who the hell I think I am, and that I am not Miss Universe to be so arrogant. Apparently his sister told him about our \"conversation\", and he was offended that I said he wasn't my type, and that I didn't properly congratulate him. I reminded him he is a stranger to me, and that Maya said that even handshake was uncomfortable. I said that him not being my type meant nothing would happen even if he looked like Tom Hardy, because he is MARRIED, he is too old for me, and even if he was single, my personal boundaries are telling me not to kiss strangers. It's plain weird. He wasn't having it, and went on whole rant about my manners and lack of tact. I literally left him on read and blocked him.\n\nI'm now realizing my comment about him not being my type probably sounded to them like I think I am better than him, and that I was \"masking\" my \"crush\" towards him, complete fu*king stranger. I'm trying to remember what did I do to give him impression that I like him as a man. \n\nAITA for not kissing him on the cheek when I was giving my congrats, and was my choice of words that poor that it made me an asshole?", "created_utc": 1673801352, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cog8r/aita_for_not_kissing_a_best_man/", "score": 479, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm glad that someone knows that whole line up thing is awkward as hell, and I'd rather skip it, but couldn't because bride was really close family member.

But if you want to know: you smoke, your teeth are jank, you smell, you slept with prostitutes and I\u2019d be worried about getting a disease, you do hardcore drugs, and you cheat your friends out of money, you call yourself a \u2018good muslim\u2019 while doing all of those things, and doing all of those just makes you a hypocrite\u201d.\n\nHe was speechless.

You don\u2019t owe creeps anything including a second thought.", "Let me preface this by saying that OP is 100% NTA, and this guy definitely sounds like a creep. However, it sounds like OP is from someplace (this is a VERY common custom in southern Europe, the Balkans, and parts of the Middle East) where it's a custom to greet friends and family with a kiss on the cheek, or both cheeks. And some (usually older) people just do it to pretty much everyone. Some communities will do this upon being formally introduced to someone(again... Usually older people). (My wife was a little surprised when we visited the village in Greece where my father was from and all the old yiayias (grandmothers)and papous (grandfathers) kissed her on the cheeks upon being introduced) And sometimes, there's some social awkwardness involved when it turns out that two people have different feelings with regards to how close they are to each other or how comfortable they are with the custom itself. But the kiss is absolutely non-sexual, non-romantic in nature. It's given and received from all genders and to all genders.\n\nMy point here is that being married or not doesn't matter at all here. And indeed, it sounds like there is zero reason for Marco to feel offended or anything else about OP not kissing him, and he very well would know that. It sounds like he's projecting and a freaking creep. The kiss or lack thereof doesn't change this.", "Yes, BM (Best man) is Marco, sorry if I wasn't clear.", "I was just thinking \"oh gosh.

Lol", "NTA. You were deliberately put in a no-win scenario because of other people\u2019s egos.", "NTA the only thing I would have done differently is block him after the first message without replying. You can\u2019t argue with somebody that stupid.", "NTA, 100%.  My take on this is that Marco thinks he's some kind of \"god's gift to women\" & deserves to have them all throwing themselves at him.  Or as other commenters have said, it's possible his wife is behind this & somehow thought you were coming on to him & she's actually the one who sent the nasty message.  Altho from what you've said, there was only the moment when you shook his hand, so that seems way out there.  I would talk to Ivana & see if this is Marco's normal behavior. \n\nInfo:  What relationship does Marco have with your cousin's husband?  I would be extremely careful if you go to any dinners/parties at Ivana's that Marco will be at.  He sounds like someone who would try to trap you in an out of the way corner & force himself on you.", "NTA, dude is a creep lashing out in a rage because you bruised his fragile little ego.", "NTA.\n\nI come from a country with a similar custom. Tell your parents and let them handle this. The fact that he not onlyade a big deal out of you shaking his hand but also reached out to you to complain? \n\n**Yeah, he is a creep!**\n\nDo not ignore this because he is for sure talking crap to anyone that will listen. Talk to your parents and have them handle the situation. That man should be embarrassed by his actions.", "Don\u2019t forget about being delusional over a handshake \ud83e\udd1d mate must have never touched another person outside their family before", "I bet it\u2019s his wife sending the messages", "And OP should bring it up to her cousin because this guy might try to spin a different story and cause problems for OP if he gets the first word"]}
