My husband knew a couple days in advance that I had these plans. Husband had no interest in joining so he wanted to spend his Saturday relaxing at home. Cool, fine by me. \n\nI left the house around 1030am and predicted I'd be home around 3 or 330pm. Husband was okay with that. I said I'll also grab dinner at our favorite local deli so we don't have to cook tonight. Husband was okay with that. \n\nI made 2 stops for my errands and got to the park around 1115, same time as dad. (He volunteers there a lot so it's not out of the ordinary to spend a Saturday afternoon there doing some yard work or whatever needs done. Not sure if that really matters, but whatever) Dad and I are cleaning up weeds and brush and then we go to the gun club down the road. \n\nThe property line for this gun club is on the side of a mountain. The hike is steep up the first side. The top is flat and the other side is obviously downhill. It's a tough trek for just about anybody. My dad is 65. Another guy helping us is around the same age (not sure exactly how old he is) and he had a heart attack last year. I'm a little chunky myself, so the three of us took our time hiking, checking the fence, clearing brush, etc. We didn't want anyone to get hurt so we didnt rush. \n\nI realized this was taking longer than predicted so I texted my husband to let him know that I'm sorry, but it's going to be later than I thought. He didn't seem too upset. \n\nWe finally finished around 430pm and I immediately placed our dinner order. Pickup was going to be 525pm. I texted my husband once again, apologizing that I'm late and letting him know what time I would be getting dinner. No response. \n\nI get to the deli at 520pm and as soon as I park I get a text saying \"I sure hope you're in (town) right now getting our food.\" \n\nMe: Yes I'm waiting for it. I'm sorry. \n\nHim: Now what? \n\nMe: For being so late. \n\nHim: (smiley face cowboy hat emoji) \n\nIdk what the emoji response meant. But our order wasn't ready until 550pm because the deli was so  busy. I didn't get home until 6pm. \n\nAs I walk in the door he said \"I might as well just go to bed.\" And he gave me the silent treatment the rest of the night. \n\nSilent treatment again this morning until we both blew up. He yelled at me for leaving him alone all day. I yelled at home that some of what happened was out of my control. \n\nI've been crying on and off all day. I had so much spending time with my dad. I don't get to see him much anymore so I cherish the time with him. Did I take it too far by being 3 hours late? AITA? \n\nTLDR: Spent the afternoon with my dad and got home 3 hours later than predicted. Husband is mad and accused me of purposely leaving him home alone all day.", "created_utc": 1680451494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129pjkp/aita_for_spending_a_saturday_with_my_dad_and/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Permanently alone. Get a counselor just for yourself- you are being driven to a day of tears by his manipulative silent treatment and controlling possessiveness. He wants you to feel upset and off balance so he's punishing you until you do. But you aren't doing anything wrong.

No reason HE couldn't have placed an order at your favorite local deli,  or made himself a sandwich?", "NTA Plans change. Sometimes stuff happens you can't prevent. Your husband is a grown ass man, too old to be behaving like a petulant child. Personally I'd love it if I had the whole house to myself on my day off because it very rarely happens. Your husband had the choice to go with you or stay home. He chose to stay home. Yes you were home later than you planned but Boo Hoo your husband had to be all by his little lonesome for a few hours. And its not like you didn't communicate more than once when things got changed. I'd spend next Saturday doing something away from him as well, if hes gonna behave like a little child all the time. I'm petty like that. And besides, you're an adult. If you need to do stuff you don't need his permission to do so, and sometimes stuff takes all day.", "NTA.

He is not the boss of your time. He is not your entire world. If he tries to make himself the sole person in your world, that is unhealthy and could be a red flag toward co-dependency and abuse. You are an adult and can go where you want. You also texted him to let him know you were running late so he wouldn't worry. You are not responsible for entertaining him the entire day. He is also an adult and can take care of himself. You are not responsible for his happiness. If he is mad, it is his fault, not yours.", "NTA your husband is trying to isolate you from your dad.

The fact that you checked in with him so many times and apologized so many times makes me think this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s made you feel guilty about spending time with anyone who isn\u2019t him.

Why did you have to keep reporting to him where you were and how long you were going to take?\n\nDo you not see your father much because that controlling prick you married is isolating you by demanding your time and space? \n\nAnd now he is emotionally abusing you with a cold war. Girl, you need to wake up and see how bad it is.", "My ex used to simmer and blow up at me for \"taking too long\" with family tasks like \"visiting my terminally ill grandfather in the hospital\" and \"going over my dad's updated funeral plan.\" He basically felt that anything that I was doing personally was way less important than just hanging out and bullshitting with him, and that my family were just people while his family were vitally important.\n\nIt's fine to be annoyed when plans go sideways and create inconvenience, or to want a certain amount of communication/warning.

Do you feel the need to over apologize to keep him from getting mad at you?", "He is not Kevin McAllister.

Especially if you were spending time with a loved one. \n\nHe seems controlling. Leaving him alone all day isn't going to be the death of him. He sees you everyday and you live together. I totally agree with others who called this borderline abusive behaviour. If there's one thing abusers do...it's limit our contact with others...and ik he isn't exactly doing this here but if he ever does...RUN FOR IT. And the silent treatment is really just emotional manipulation. Whatever happened to communication? \n\nNTA but your husband sure is", "NTA.  \n\n\nYour husband needs one or more hobbies.

Yeah, put the whiny  husband to bed.", "NTA  more info, is it your husbands time of the month?", "NTA\n\nSerious here. He needs some therapy to learn self-regulation for emotional regulation and awareness. He needs to learn how to communicate effectively and be by himself. He had the choice of going with you or not, and this was the natural consequence of not. Plans changed time wise not event wise and you communicated them as you could. Your relationship with your dad and community is just as important as an SO.", "Is this something that happens often? If so, your husband has a right to be annoyed. My boyfriend has poor time management skills sometimes and is consistently late for stuff we have planned, but when he has plans with other people, he miraculously figures out how to be on time. It makes me feel like I'm less of a priority and I think he just thinks since we live together and see each other all the time being a little late isn't a big deal, but to me it is. That being said, your husbands reaction was extreme and was probably getting hangry by the time you arrived with food. You're definitely not an AH for spending time with your dad and he could have gone with you.
