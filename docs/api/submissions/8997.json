The due date is not an appointment (if it is not induced or CS). You need someone to be ready at least 2 weeks before and 1 week after the due date. And that feels a bit short tbh, I would like more time from the designated babysitter if I were you.\n\nIt is only reasonable to share the readyness between your mom and MIL.

To this day my mom regrets letting her insist on helping but she was the closest option at the time and my mother genuinely hoped she'd be better about it.\n\nBottom line is: you should be focused on what's going to give you the most peace of mind during this period.

You don't want to stress while you're in labor, and as you know, babies don't wait.", "Honestly, is sounds like the \"don't have the baby on X day\" comment was a joke.  Did she tell your husband the nature of her schedule conflict?  Was it something medical or legal that would have been difficult to reschedule or was it something purely social where it was just a FOMO thing?  Personally for peace of mind I'd see if your mom can be the primary (if she's agreeable) and let your MIL in law know that it's taken care of and even though it didn't work out you genuinely appreciate the offer.     \n\n\nThe last weeks of pregnancy are a stressful time (LOL and having two children under five is pretty darn stressful as well lol) and you don't need the additional stress of potentially having to figure out where your kids are going at the last minute.   Given that MIL isn't 100% committed to this the statistical probability that she black out yet another date needs to be taken into consideration.", "I agree she does not need to be stressed out, and the MIL certainly worded it very... odd?\n\nBut I do not see how it should stress her out to have 2 numbers to call depending on what day it is. Sunday - Friday:  MIL. Saturday: Mom. No biggie.", "OH and absolutely NTA", "I\u2019m not really sure that I see a problem.  Line up your Mom for the 27th.  So that if you go into labour on that day you are covered.  Any other day would be your MIL.  \n\nI am puzzled that she made plans on that day knowing that was your due date.", "INFO: what are her plans? Are they something she can't change like a doctors appointment or something that can be changed or canceled?", "NTA  \n\n\nHow can MIL care for children when she can't seem to grasp the basic concept that babies are born on THEIR timetable not the MIL's timetable.   \n\n\nYikes.", "Phone tree. Even if it was a joke, she made you question her reliability and your mother is as valid of a choice as any. I wouldn't toss her out entirely just in case the unthinkable happens, but she can be below your mother on the phone tree.\n\nPersonally, I think I'd have a loooooong phone tree including both mothers and then others, but you've had two kids already so you have an idea of what you're in for, you don't need my advice on that. \n\nOne thing though, it seems really manipulative to demand to be the one to watch the kids, because it seems like the purpose is probably more selfish than selfless. She wants early access to the newborn, first sighting aside from you two. Which she'll definitely get if she's watching your kids in your home while you're at the hospital. I'm petty, admittedly, so depending on my relationship with her I might deny it out of pure spite.", "What are the plans? Too broad to know.", "\"make sure she doesnt have the baby on that day as i have plans\"? like she expects you to just hold the labor as if somebody holding their pee for awhile? she is awfully clueless, and so is your husband.  when the contractions start, nothing and nobody can stop that. NTA", "NTA\n\nBut, I don't get it. What's the big deal?  MIL is being a bit possessive and not a little irrational to make plans for your due date. But, hey, feces occurs. So you have your mother standing by in case 2/27 becomes the birthday for child #3. If that spoils MIL's little power play, so what? \n\nAgain, NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom has just as much right to be involved, and your mil knows very well you can't control when you go into labor. Making plans around the due date is asking for trouble and adding stress to you", "NTA.  I mean, what type of person actually thinks you could control when you go into labor?  I suppose if you did go into labor that day, she would be unhappy with you.  She's making this about her, which is a red flag.", "NTA. MIL has 364 other days to do these plans and chose your due date. That says all you need to know.", "NTA, but your husband is.", "NTA. Your MIL is.\n\nCall your mom, make the plans you need to keep you at ease, and let DH and MIL sort out their own shit.\n\nThe end.\n\nedited for typos", "NTA.", "You are about to pop a baby out and the last thing you need is additional stress. Go with your intuition and if that is to ask your mom, then do it. Your husband and MIL can deal with it. Congrats on the upcoming baby and good luck OP.", "NTA. Sometimes things come up, so I dont blame her for having plans,\nHowever you need to do what is easiest and less stress for you. If you feel more comfortable having it be your mom, so be it.", "Op - if you are being really honest do you like you MIL? If no, have you ever told your SO how you truly feel?", "NTA.  Because it's SO easy to say \"Hey kid...can you just wait a lil bit longer\" when they are on their way out.  Your MIL has proven she can't be reliable, so it's smart that you have another backup available!", "NTA.\n\n>My husband thinks I'm being irrational and it's just one day.\n\nIt's not just one day, it is your *due date.*  That is the one-day MIL shouldn't have made any concrete plans for, tentative plans would have been okay.  If you go into labor that day what is your husband going to do?  Try and hold the kid in?!\n\nTo your husband: Dude your wife isn't being irrational.  If she goes into labor on her due date *someone* needs to watch your kids.  Your mother has made herself unavailable by her choice.  Rather than running around on and being stressed out about who is taking your kids your wife chose to have *more reliable* childcare in place.", "Pregnant woman have all the say, whatever makes you more comfortable", "NTA do whatever you need to make it easier the mil needs to not be flaky in the future", "What if you have to have a C section on 2/25? Is she going to take the kids for 2 days but not the 3rd? NTA.", "NTA, this is so bizarre. It is not the mother's decision, the baby may come anytime. Ask your mom for help. Your husband is being unreasonable.", "NTA. This, OP, tell your husband you're stressed enough. Your mom is going to watch them. He needs to let his mom know that you both understand she made other plans, but you need someone who can be available at any time, so your mom is going to watch the kids.\n\nIf your husband argues, I'd be giving him the side-eye. I've had multiple kids and my husband treated me like an angel. He saw how brutal everything was and wanted to do everything in his power to make it easier on me. If your husband doesn't want to do the same, that doesn't say anything good about him.", "Exactly. When I was expecting my second and third children, WHAT WILL I DO WITH MY OLDER CHILDREN WHEN I GO INTO LABOR was a worry that sent me into anxiety spirals. Make plans you can count on and put your mind at ease (as much as possible during this stressful time).", "It's three weeks out so it's very, very unlikely to be a funeral. The dead rarely wait for anyone before things get smelly or dusty. Waiting even a week requires some fairly extensive precautions.", "I dont see why having her mom be primary with MIL as back up is an issue. If you can't be available on the literal due date, you should be the back up. Its just logical.", "Why  we need to take a face value? Maybe, just maybe, the MIL was joking? Being playfull? \n\nShe is a mother herself it is safe to say that she know you can't \"hold on the labor\"", "My husband has 3 sisters, and one of them volunteered to be on call to watch our dogs and cat when I went into labor. She reiterated it about a week or two before I had my baby. The day I went into labor, she said she was unable to come. Husband had to leave the hospital to walk and feed the dogs before the baby was born. Thankfully, another sister was able to come by a few hours later. \n\nWe learned after that SIL...took the week of my due date off of work. Girl, it's not an appointment. Both her and other SIL work from home, so either of them could have covered without calling out, minus the commute to our place.", "I see you\u2019re getting a lot of downvotes, but you aren\u2019t wrong. Ofc this doesn\u2019t apply to abusive and terrible MILs, but sometimes it\u2019s just a case of personalities clashing.  \n\nMy MIL and I didn\u2019t get along at first. I thought she hated me. One day I realized that I was going to be dealing with her for 20+ years and I didn\u2019t want my kids seeing a dysfunctional relationship play out. I knew one of us had to go first so I decided to just start being nicer. Luckily, she\u2019s a great person and followed my lead. Now we get along great and my ILs have been wonderful to know all these years. We don\u2019t agree on everything but they know when to step back and I know when some things aren\u2019t worth arguing over. We feel really lucky to have them in our lives. \n\nThis would not work with everyone. Some people can\u2019t resist being petty and some will take advantage. If that\u2019s case then you have to keep your distance. If you have reasonably decent people for in-laws it\u2019s worth it try to get along better. If they don\u2019t reciprocate restructure your boundaries, but sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised.", "I don't understand why you didn't just ask your mom in the first place?  You obviously want your mom's help & your MIL should understand this.  The fact that she doesn't want you to have the baby on your due date is messed up to me.  Makes no sense.  Sounds like MIL is the AH.", "NTA. Your MIL is the one who made plans on your due date, knowing that she might need to watch your kids. You need to make the decision based on what will be easiest and less stressful for you since you are the one who will be giving birth!", "NTA\nYou can't control when the baby will come out. Even though it's rare, giving birth on your due date is absolutely possible, my daughter exactly came on her due date.\nIn this situation you have to be sure about your other kids being cared for and if your MIL isn't willing to be reliable, then ask your mom.", "Sis, do NOT set yourself on fire to keep her warm.\n\nLabor is about you and your medical needs. Not pacifying your MIL.\n\nCome up with a plan B and make that plan A. Call your Mom the moment you go into labor and have her watch the kids. That makes more sense anyway since she is reliable.", "NTA, but it's your mil so you have to pretend like she's not a selfish B. Be gracious, be appreciative but let her know that her plans are on your due date so there is a good chance she's going to get the call on that day. Ask her if that happens will she be able to come or do you need to make other arrangements. You don't want to be in labor looking for child care. Honesty and direct communication is always the best bet!", "Nta. If you promise to cake take off the children when you go into labor then i would make sure i don\u2019t have any plans around your due date. You never know what can happen. What she did was making empty promises", "Your MIL **insisted.**  You didn't make that decision, she took it away from you.  \n\nSo take it back.  Make the arrangements you wanted to make in the first place, with someone that you know you can trust and rely on, which is a necessary thing for you during labor.  You don't have to tell her, just make the arrangements you want to make.  Get the bags packed for the kids, and take them over early to your mom's so that you don't have to worry about their stuff last minute.  Give her the numbers she needs for them, and go get her signed up with permission to pick them up, and take other people off that permission.  Do the plans you want to do.  And when MIL asks about your plans, tell her it's  handled, she doesn't have to worry about it.   And don't give her details.  This isn't about what MIL wants.  It's about your needs.  One need is for you to have plans for the other kids, and to know that you can trust the caregivers to actually be there.\n\nYou taking back control over your own life isn't wrong.  NTA.", "Do what is easiest for you but one day of plans does not make someone unreliable lol.", "Absolutely not. You are right", "NTA. \n\nThis is the last thing you need to worry about, your MIL know that. \n\nI\u2019d find someone else. You do whatever makes you comfortable. \n\nGood luck!!", "NTA", "Why does ANYONE in your life believe what THEY want trumps YOUR baby delivery?

Cross your legs and hold it in? They come when they come!\n\nNTA. You don't need to be worrying about this on top of the stress of late pregnancy.", "INFO: Did you ask what kind of plans MIL has?  They may not be the kind of thing she has control over.", "NTA. If someone doesn\u2019t understand that you can\u2019t hold a baby in, they don\u2019t understand basic biology and are  unfit to be responsible for kids.

Reminds me of when I was pregnant with my youngest. My mom told me not to go into labor on certain dates because she had plans. My MIL did the same thing. Between the two of them, they had most of the month I was due \u201cblocked off\u201d. I was complaining to my dad (he and my mom are divorced) and he just shrugged and said, \u201cThat baby\u2019s gonna come when she wants to. I don\u2019t know what they think they\u2019re gonna do about it.\u201d", "Even though OP's MIL seems to be deliberately aggravating OP about this, you're spot on that she may not have done anything unreasonable and may be willing to cancel.  Furthermore, I don't think having a \"plan that won't require a backup\" is reasonable.  Babies don't come on a schedule and expecting anyone to keep their schedule completely free for 5+ weeks isn't really tenable.\n\nI am unsure why OP asking someone else to be on call on that specific day in case it's needed would be a problem.", "Right, I get it - but did you ask her what the plans were? I find it odd that she would have made something that she couldn\u2019t cancel. But - if this is something she has to do, at this time, on that day, where she has no choice in cancelling, then it is out of her control. Does she has a doctors appt with a specialist that takes a year to get into? It must be super, super important. I don\u2019t think she would have done this on purpose. But - did you ask her what they are? 95% of the time, im sure, that even if she said they can\u2019t be cancelled, they could be if you actually do go into labor or if you have already had the baby and she is watching the kids. There is a 5% chance that there is no choice and you won\u2019t know unless you ask her. \n\nI am clearly also in the minority here as the Reddit moms have come out in force for not the AH. \n\nBut, I still think you should talk to her and find out exactly what is happening. And express your concern as well. Seems like everything is going through your husband and it should really be you talking to her directly since you are the one so concerned. \n\nOpen communication, like adults.", ">My husband thinks I'm being irrational and it's just one day\n\ndoesn\u00b4t sounds like they made a playful joke"]}
