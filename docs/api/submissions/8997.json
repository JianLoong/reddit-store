Needing to have a backup on standby is ridiculous. Especially when she was adamant on wanting to help. Labor is unpredictable and stressful and you know it - this is not your first rodeo. You need to have all your ducks in a row before hand. Your request is simple - can you be available on or around the 27th? If the answer is no, then you need to find someone to fulfill your request. You might not have the time to call multiple people to figure out who\u2019s taking your kids. Not only that, your kids are 5 & 3. To make this whole thing less stressful for them, they should know the plan and know exactly where they\u2019re going before hand.  \n\nI had a 3F at the time of my second delivery. My water broke at home. We had a plan in place. My husband immediately called his mom and drove there to drop off my daughter. From the time my water broke, til he returned to pick me up was 20 min. I was one push away from delivering my second daughter in the car on the highway.  I\u2019m not telling you that to scare you. I\u2019m telling you tell your MIL and husband that story.

It's a thoughtless comment that probably wasn't supposed to be repeated to you. \n\nI don't think you should hold this against her but definitely ask your mom so you have a backup. You have an easy out here, just tell your mom your MIL would prefer to take them so you said okay but MIL had some other things going on so can she also be available? I would recommend as many backup plans as you can get. \n\nDon't respond to this in kind. Just let it go.", "As if you have any control over when you go into labor.

I didn't look at that perspective. I think the main thing that made me upset was her, maybe joking and saying \"make sure you don't have her on the 27th!\" Like I have that control.

Do you really think your baby will arrive bang on this random day? There's a chance, sure...but it's not a big one.

Why can't you have your mum on stand-by?

But I did mention in my posts that I am fine with her making tentative plans as long as she is able to cancel them when I need her on that day. But the plans she did make she can not cancel. Also, my first child was born on her due date, it's not as rare to have your kids on the due date anymore.", "Yeah, that was a pretty thoughtless and flippant thing for her to say. I totally get where you're coming from. I had my son on his due date, too. Still, from what I'm reading it really does sound like it's reasonable to keep her as your Plan A except on the 27th, when you can ask your mom to be Plan A. All the best.

You are making it a big deal before you have proper information.", "If it's something she wants to do, it maybe something that has a long waiting list and maybe she's already put down a none refundable deposit.  \n\nIn any case, if you already have someone else who is prepared to babysit, I'm not entirely sure why you're getting worked up.  She's given you plenty of noticed, which is not considered unreliable.", "That's the thing, though - You don't know she can't cancel the plans, you're assuming.  Her saying \"make sure she doesnt have the baby on that day as i have plans\" might just mean that the plans are important to her, not that she can't cancel them if she absolutely has to.", "4% of women have their babies in their due dates. Only 4%.  That means there is a 96% chance you will have this baby any other day.  \n\nYTA.  This isn\u2019t a reason to be upset.  Just use your mom as a backup."]}
