It sounds like you blew her off as she had to get back in contact with you instead of you calling her after you made your decision. You try to make it out like you didn\u2019t think she would like it there and you didn\u2019t have a lot of space to try to act like you were sparing her misery but she probably took it very differently. At the same time these could be very legitimate points and could be a problem for your wife if she usually uses that office for work especially if she works from home. \n\nI will say as a woman in my 40\u2019s I clearly remember how I felt about my dad and step mom when I was 17. I always felt unwelcome, like I was a burden to them if I wanted anything from them. Over two decades later I still feel that way sometimes and my kids basically have no relationship with them.
