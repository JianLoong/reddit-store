I would also be pissed if there was no main course to a dinner I\u2019m going to. And if someone else was bringing the desert then she kind of stepped on their role to do this. Literally the least she could have done was swap with someone, and make it a two people surprise.

The happy to upset whiplash is probably why most people are actually upset. Definitely something to scream into a pillow about or drag a sympathetic ear into another room and let off steam.", "YTA, why have someone unreliable make the turkey.

That outburst just made you look petty to people in attendance who might otherwise have agreed with you about the turkey.\n\nShe should have been assigned either something small (as you suggested) or to make a cake, since she clearly was not to be trusted to bring a turkey.  Who the hell does what she did?  It was a ton of effort when she could have put that effort toward putting a turkey in the oven.\n\nThe hat system your family used for these tasks is the stupidest way I think I've ever seen this done, btw.  Some people are not cut out for some tasks or may not have the resources for them and that needs to be taken into account.  The main entree should have been done by the host, or else (in a case like yours where your mother was strongarmed into hosting in the first place) by somebody *very* reliable.", "Literally all the adults suck here. Everyone knew how unreliable she is. You or your mom should have made a turkey just in case then although your cousin dropped the ball again, you would have had a real turkey and the cake which would have been awesome.", "ESH & the moment you said she's into baking, I knew she was gonna bake. It's beyond me how yall tasked the BAKER in the family with the turkey. I'm also baffled the host didn't provide the main dish, that's the etiquette almost everywhere. Host: main dishes & maybe some wine. Guests: side dishes & usually more wine if alcohol is served. If yall were gonna assign the main dishes, you should've assigned it based on what that person can do.\n\nYou said in a comment you used a hat system for assigning tasks. Yall suck for that. You also suck because you wanted to intentionally hurt her so you fired at her with information that shouldn't have been used against her (also NONE of your business). This is like bringing up someone's mental illness as a come back for messing up something.\n\nYou also suck for your punctuation and lack of paragraph usage & hurting my eyes as a result.", "ESH. Also, a tip: anytime like half the post is trying to convince us why the other party should be the AH instead of just getting into the situation usually isn\u2019t gonna help the poster\u2019s case", "ESH, mostly her. She was assigned a turkey. She did not bring a turkey and did not have a good reason for not bringing a turkey. Your anger was justified over that immediate irresponsibility, but bringing up college was not relevant; it was you venting what you admit is a one-sided beef.", "ESH there\u2019s no way the typical 22 year old should be assigned the turkey/entree. No one does this. It\u2019s bizarre all around", "ESH \n\nI love food too much and would have been so annoyed that she was so cavalier about being tasked with bringing the main dish and decided to do a show and tell of her realistic cakes. \n\nBut you managing to bring her very irrelevant college fund into it just makes it sound like your reaction was less about the turkey and more about your distaste for everything Jenna. \n\nIt served no purpose at all!", "If your cousin's issues are as well documented as you claim, then EVERYBODY in your family sucks. You all set your cousin up to see if she'd follow through. It was worthwhile entertainment for you all. Who gives one of the hardest, most time-consuming tasks to the least responsible person? Yeah, I read all about the drawing tasks randomly. You all pitched in to create this situation. You set her up to fail. \n\nYou say you were worried from the start. Did you volunteer to help out? Of course not, because you were busy with your own responsibilities and life. Did you check in with your aunt and uncle privately? Did you make sure there would be enough extra food otherwise so no one went without? You were clearly overfunctioning, but not in any practical way. You just waited for her to \"screw up\"-- and she did of course.  She makes cakes, and technically she did bring a \"turkey\" to Christmas dinner.  (Very clever and with a bit of support and structure she really could launch a successful business venture.) And you humiliated her drudging up her previous mistakes and failures. How did that improve the situation in even the slightest way? How can you think you're not the asshole here? You may not be the only asshole, but you're definitely not exempt and are on the fast track to outstanding asshole status You honestly sound petty and jealous or resentful. This situation could have been handled a thousand different ways from the start. Even in the moment there were other choices available to you and you went for the jugular. I feel sorry for your cousin. Whatever her issues are, they aren't improved upon with family that behaves as you do.

Does it seem like her mom was in on the joke?", "NTA I be pissed if I went to dinner at someone\u2019s house and this happened.\n\nNext year I do my own dinner and they can put up with her bullshit", "Could this have been any more predictable?", "YTA, your family doesn\u2019t care why should you?", "ESH.  She was wrong to just bring a cake but you were T A for shouting & bringing up things that are none of your business.", "I could have guessed she was going to make a cake. That should have been her assignment all along. YTA for expecting her to do otherwise.", "ESH\nIf you were so sure she would screw it up why didn\u2019t you make a ham or something to cover in case this happened? She should have told someone she wasn\u2019t making an actual turkey.", "NTA\n\n\nYour mother didn't want to host, people agreed on potluck, they insisted on your cousin getting the turkey and at the end you ate a meal without main, kind of sucks.", "After reading all OP\u2019s responses, NTA. I would have smashed her face into that cake for good measure.", "I\u2019m sorry but ESH. I mean yeah Jenna didn\u2019t bring the main dish she was supposed to bring but you completely overreacted in response. You\u2019re letting prior feeling dictate your reaction. Calling her out for not bringing the Turkey and just that woulda gotten you a N-T-A, but bringing up passed mess ups as a way to further bring Jenna down is cruel. Frankly who cares if she wasted the college fund if the parents don\u2019t care then why should you.", "What idiot told her to bring the turkey? And how ridiculous for her to think a cake would suffice. If this is a true story, which I doubt, I\u2019d throw her out for ruining the dinner.", "NTA - why in the hell would you let the narcissist party girl make the main dish?", "ESH.", "ESH.

She\u2019s 22. Her college fund is super none of your business and you sound jealous. She brought a Turkey. It wasn\u2019t what you wanted, but you also left the biggest dish of the meal in the hands of an unreliable 22 year old, so\u2026 It\u2019s just one of those things. If you wanted things done your way you have to do them yourself.", "Yell at her.\nGo to the store and get a ham.\n\nI would have gotten a turkey at Popeyes and kept it out of sight until Jenna proved what an unreliable person she is.\n\nWhy are you surprised?", "NTA she agreed on the food item, then made something completely different probably trying to show out and of course didn\u2019t see any issue with it.", "***\"Half of the family is siding with my uncle and aunts and saying I didn\u2019t have to shout at her while the others are saying I\u2019m in the right.\"***\n\nNTAHmmm.... saying that you didn't have to shout doesn't actually mean that you are in the wrong. I would say that sums it up pretty accurately though. You didn't need to shout at her but you are certainly in the right. What kind of an inconsiderate, irresponsible child blows off the main course to make a cake??**YOU** ruined Christmas?? Tell your aunt and uncle that \"ruining\" Christmas is 100% on their daughter.  \nPS: Throwing in the comment about her college fund was a low blow and an AH move.", "The kids probably thought the turkey cake as a main course was great. \n\nThe people who designated who provided the various food items is at fault here. They didn't use common sense and go with people's strengths. Cake aside, I wouldn't ask a 22 single woman who has never prepared a turkey in her life to provide one. If she couldn't bake, I would have asked her to bring something easy, like a salad.", "No NTA. I\u2019d be pretty angry if this happened. Someone needs to start calling her out in her bs. Nothing you said was untrue.", "NTA. Your family insisted on giving the most important job to the golden child even though she is chronically unreliable, you warned them she would fuck it up, she fucked it up, and now they are mad at you for saying she fucked up?\n\nIt's not like she tried her best and burned it or dropped it, she deliberately chose to show off and make something else knowing that the whole family would only have side dishes to eat on Christmas Day, and your family is still defending her like they have every other time.\n\nI don't know why people are saying YTA because she shouldn't have been given the job in the first place, because you tried to tell your family that and they wouldn't listen because she can do no wrong. I also don't know why people think YTA for holding a grudge - it's not a grudge when what you're angry about is an ongoing problem. Your cousin is a flake who constantly screws up, never has any consequences, and your family keeps giving her responsibilities and letting her inconvenience everyone else because they think the sun shines out of her ass. Who wouldn't be frustrated?", "Why would you task your \u201cunreliable, spoiled\u201d cousin with the main dish?!? \n\nThis was set up for failure and when people praised her you lost it \nESH but YTA, deal with your own feelings with this cousin", "ESH. \n\nI knew from the beginning once you said realistic cakes where this was going, and your cousin wouldn't have sucked so much if she had also brought an actual turkey. It's great that she has something she is actually good at and excited about, but this was not the right time to showcase it without bringing the actual item she was supposed to bring. \n\nHowever, you are the AH for what you said to her, and just how you talk about her in general. I get that she is probably in fact spoiled, but you come off as jealous as well. Then, when she didn't bring the turkey you threw so much into her face rather than just being annoyed by the one thing at the moment. \n\nHer parents suck for spoiling her too.

We used a normal large tote bag for the serving dishes and utensils and the one pan I needed to finish the sauce at their house. I brought the other sauces and salad dressing in jars we got from a local restaurant when they were doing take out cocktails during Covid. Honestly, the transporting it all the way to my in-laws (they live about 7 towns away) and having it all arrive at the right temperature was easy.

I, I am guessing like most 22 year olds, did not own a roasting pan in which to cook a turkey, much less a cooler in which to conveniently transport it. I definitely didn\u2019t own the niceties that makes it easier like a brining bag or a huge, fancy, heavy-bottomed roasting pan, or roasting rack, or meat thermometer, or baster, or turkey lifting forks (to flip the turkey and take it out of the pan for serving/carving!

But, none of that changes the fact that cousin was extremely selfish, entitled and she single handedly ruined Christmas (or greatly altered it at the least). She absolutely deserved to be called out on her willingness to ruin the dinner. It sounds like OP is the only one to attempt to teach her cousin some social and behavioral cues that most people take for granted. She has been spoiled for so long, she doesn\u2019t live in reality.

She delighted in telling the world what a colossal screw up her cousin is and has always been and how she's always gotten away with it until OP finally rubbed it all in her face. This is my personal bias, but I think intention should always be a factor in assessing these kinds of judgments. I think OP's intention was to hurt her cousin and feel justified in doing so. That's ultimately why I chose to hold her more directly accountable.", "Tbh, I agree with much of what you've said above, particularly about the cousin's selfishness and entitlement. But OP asked for judgment on her \"reaction\" and like most people, she gave too much unnecessary backstory. If she had called her cousin out just for the issue at hand, I'd have little to say except to nod in agreement. But no, she had to let us know that she has one-sided resentments and list all of this cousin's failures long before Christmas day. And she waited, dripping with bitterness, to hurl it all at her cousin at the opportune moment. Did the cousin screw up? Yes. OP's cousin has got issues, to put it mildly. Maybe she's just spoiled, but regardless OP didn't do anyone any favors. Now she's got drama with her cousin, her aunt, and her uncle. She made a bad situation worse. (Consider this: OP's cousin seemed genuinely surprised that OP was upset she didn't make a turkey. I'm shocked, honestly.) \n\nOP has centered herself here, but she's not the only person in this family inconvenienced. She's not more entitled to outrage that anyone else. Not her mom who hosted. Not everyone else who went hungry. She actually shouldn't be the first in line to ask for accountability. Yet she took it upon herself to insult her cousin -- again, throwing everything up from the past at her face. Do you think that this somehow magically taught her cousin \"social and behavioral cues\" after all this time? No, OP just unloaded her personal resentments. That's asshole behavior and it's always asshole behavior. There's room at the table for more than one asshole. Accountability doesn't require cruelty and in the moment it definitely didn't matter that OP's cousin screwed up her college fund. If OP's cousin were writing this, I'd definitely call her out for agreeing to take on this responsibility without any intentions of or plan for following through.

You don't have to be nice to a 22yr old adult who decides to ignore the task she was given for a family dinner especially when she was given an out when assigned it but agreed to do it anyways.", "NTA a million times over. I'd have been furious. Did she think it was cute to show up with a damned cake instead of a turkey and not even bother warning anyone that their main course would be missing? She's obviously been allowed to get away with murder for years and years and someone needed to put her in her place.", "NTA\n\nIf she made a cake to look like an insignificant side dish, she'd get a pass from me. Her job was to prepare the MAIN COURSE of Christmas dinner! She selfishly decided to spend her time making a cake that NO ONE asked for! How anyone could let that slide without being pissed off at her is beyond me. Literally a case of \"you had one job...\"", "NTA she had one job and she couldn\u2019t even do that.", "Resentment central over here. Wow.", "You're right, but you're also an AH.", "ESH You are old enough to know better than to talk to people in that way. You lost any high ground you had VERY quickly.", "I would've sent her back out to get rotisserie chickens. NTA", "YTA only because as unreliable as she is at 22 you seem salty about money. So as long as you can admit that straight away - you feel entitled to what she has - go ahead and bag on a barely adult.", "YTA because you can't write a proper paragraph, and this is an annoying post to read.", "ESH\n\nThe family must have known Jenna wasn't going to bring the turkey so why task her to do it\n\nThere was no point yelling or bringing up her past history on xmas day.", "ESH Jenna made Christmas about her and her talents whilst actively lying to you and letting you down. She has no right to be upset by your understandable reaction.\n\nWhat are you doing mentioning her college fund? Her family\u2019s finances are literally none of your business.", "I was a bit on the fence about it but the lack of paragraphs makes it YTA from me.", "YTA for not using paragraphs.\n\nI can't comment on what you're asking, because I can't read that massive block of unbroken text.", "NTA. She could have done so and brought the turkey herself or asked someone else to. Instead she decided to make it about herself and deprive others of the main protein of the meal.", "ESH - you didn't need to bring her college fund into it assuming you weren't the one paying. It's none of your business. \n\nYou were right to be annoyed about the turkey though. She should have organised a real one too.", "ESH but more also YTA \n\nEveryone knew what happened so you didn't have to state the obvious and bring up past issues!", "The half telling you off are just scared of her parents' reaction. \n\nThis is what happens when you don't parent a child because you think they are special. Irresponsible and selfish.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She seriously dropped the ball. I say this as a vegetarian who wouldn\u2019t care about the turkey missing.", "\"Then let them eat cake\"\n\nNTA", "I think you had a right to complain about the turkey, but bringing up her college fund, eesh. It was not the right time or place, nor any of your business.", "Yta, if she do dessert and cake, you should had ask her for cake. Not turkey.", "I still can\u2019t imagine how you guys didn\u2019t have a backup dinner planned given how unreliable she is. I wouldn\u2019t have given her any task to begin with, and she sounds extremely exhausting. The yelling was not necessary, but I understand why you did it.", "YTA. She\u2019s 8 years younger than you, and those 8 years mean a lot when they\u2019re your 20s. And why go off on her not just about the Turkey, but about her life choices?", "ESH - Bringing up her college fund was not called for. You should have simply asked her, what was everyone going to eat for dinner?", "I\u2019m going with NTA, but there was no need to bring up her college fund. Although, a nice \u201cI told you so\u201d to everyone might have been warranted.", "YTA. Do you ever have to ask? How is it any of your business or concern what happened with the college fund? Also. Did you die because there wasn\u2019t any turkey? Good fucking lord you must be insufferable.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nCongratulations, you no longer have a *one-sided* beef with her.", "Agree completely.", "Agreed, and I also think bringing up the college fund was over the top.", "At 22, she is also old enough to say whether or not she is capable of completing the assignment. She thought to one-up everyone else with a cake that wasn\u2019t included in the menu rather than do what she was assigned and then add her cake if she felt it was so necessary. OP was only making a point to say \u201cyou can f-up a f-up!\u201d And \u201cI told you so!\u201d all in the same breath.", "It's an entertaining story, but almost definitely fake.", "You don't know what I can and cannot do and making an unjust opinion because a person can't write a proper paragraph is sooooo", "Like 90% of what is on this sub, only Liz would ever do that", "It honestly depends. Sometimes theres a dedicated person who just does the main dish so well and they enjoy doing it that they want nobody else to do it (My partners mother) \ud83d\ude05. But I'm fine with that because we host since she moved into a smaller home and spaz out on the decorations/gifts like crazy for the family's kids anyways.", "I don\u2019t think it had to be the host.  Hosting is a lot of work, so outsourcing the main dish isn\u2019t an awful idea.\n\nOutsourcing it to a flakey college student is.\n\nEntirely with you on the ESH.", "exactly what I was going to say! And a story to tell in the years to come! I actually thought it was kinda hilarious. I also saw it coming when OP mentioned realistic cakes", "I'm going to disagree.  A 22 year old is a fully grown adult who is old enough to have graduated college.  There is no reason whatsoever someone her age couldn't have cooked a turkey.  And while you can make it complicated to cook a turkey, you can also put salt and pepper on it and stick it in the oven for the time they tell you to on the package and take it out when the thermometer says to.  It's truly one of the most basic dishes you can make.\n\nI agree the one-sided beef is ridiculous but I'm not sure why we're infantilizing the 22 year old.", "BEST response", "Shrimp aren\u2019t kosher.", "Right? It wasn't OP's idea.", "omg your poor mom \ud83d\ude2d my family was always stuck with the hosting aka my mom and dad prettty much providing everything. Probably because we had the bigger house to accommodate everyone and she\u2019s a great cook. Maybe 1-2 family relatives brought a side dish or dessert. She finally put her foot down 10 years ago and it stuck ever since. I\u2019m hoping your mother doesn\u2019t have to deal with all of that anymore.", ">And while you can make it complicated to cook a turkey, you can also put salt and pepper on it and stick it in the oven for the time they tell you to on the package and take it out when the thermometer says to. \n\nThe issue isn't so much that part, as then transporting a family-sized turkey. I don't think I have anything large enough to carry a whole turkey other than the baking pan, which would be too hot (and heavy) to transport.", "That's a stupid system!", "I swear, people skim through the posts and make a foolish judgments/comments.", "I don't think she even planned to make anything but a turkey cake from the second she drew it in the lottery.", "I believe the personal is put in mainly to say - this woman has had a history of being flaky. The parents knew that, and yet they still enabled that behavior. Now when she was to perform where it impacts others and just not the parents - the parents were STILL unwilling to step in. All the way to her baking a cake and her parents are still in her side.", "I understand that upon re-reading, but the question asked what they ate, and the answer was \u2018we had turkey\u2019. Being autistic, I do take things very literally lol!", "Is it really a big deal to not have meat for one meal? Sounds like there was plenty of food to eat, and no one was going to go hungry. Sure, she should have brought what she said she would. But it was hardly the disaster OP made it out to be.", "1. OP didn\u2019t design the system, so your dislike of it is irrelevant. The cousin could have just asked for something else. \n\n2. The cousin could have SAID NO. Why are you acting like this GROWN ASS ADULT can\u2019t use her words? \n\n3. You\u2019re acting like she tried really hard to make the turkey but didn\u2019t realize what a big job it was and it went terribly wrong, which would have been irritating but understandable. Instead, she didn\u2019t even bother in the first place, LIED TO EVERYONE and then cried like a goddamn child when people weren\u2019t absolutely thrilled. \n\n4. 22 is old enough for basic manners and consideration of others.

I\u2019m surprised at these comments looool", "I've had some awful turkey, or hours-late turkey, from people who don't know how to do it well. Dried out is common, but also half raw and needed to be put back in the oven an hour.\n\nNot everyone can follow recipes.", "I\u2019m not defending the cousin. I\u2019m saying this was a foreseeable outcome. Based on what OP told us about this person, it was practically that something would go wrong with the turkey. It was either going to be dry, undercooked or nonexistent. There\u2019s a reason families make people earn the privilege of cooking certain dishes for holidays.", "Yep!", "Yup.  A guest bringing a whole ass cooked turkey is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve read today", "It kind of does ruin it for the Jewish family when the only other protein available isn\u2019t kosher.", "It's not your autism, I read it the same way because that's what she wrote.", "For some people, it is a big deal, especially if everything else was made as a side to accompany a main meat dish. Not the end of the world but definitely a disappointing meal.", "In another comment OP said the cousin was excited to do it. She also had plenty of time to ask for help if she was finding it difficult. There\u2019s absolutely no excuse to make a turkey shaped cake in place of a turkey when there are plenty of other options at your disposal. Regardless of how the responsibility came to her, by volunteer or assignment, it was still her responsibility and if she realized she couldn\u2019t do it she should\u2019ve asked for help ASAP", "We've had a few holidays where my sister in-law forgot to turn on the oven, or someone leaned on the control panel and turned off the  oven.  \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05  Always an adventure, but I love it all", "Agreed! It\u2019s so odd they do it this way! I wouldn\u2019t want to have to try and transport a Turkey to someone else\u2019s house!", "You have to do more than add butter. But adding butter is often the part people miss. They don\u2019t add enough fat and so their turkeys dry out.", "Not for people that know how. It\u2019s very easy for me. Most people don\u2019t put in the effort to do it well and dry out their turkeys.", "So someone takes on a task to make a turkey but makes a cake instead and somehow other people should have  known.\n\n\nAre you the cousin?", "1. No one needed to eat meat that meal. If she chooses not to eat shrimp because her husband is kosher, her choice. \n2. No where was it mentioned that it was a kosher turkey and if either of them are that strict, they should be bringing their own food anyway. \n3. Get over it. It\u2019s Christmas. There\u2019s plenty of food. If your day is ruined because of a cake, I\u2019m jealous of your life.", "It is what was literally written, but it was clear from the context of the entire rest of the post that there was no turkey, otherwise what would be the point of it", "There is failing - oops the Turkey is under done! Oops the Turkey is over done! It\u2019s too salty! That\u2019s a fail but understandable.\n\nHey everyone I baked a cake instead of a Turkey - insane!", "Except she didn\u2019t \u201cscrew it up\u201d, did she? She never even bothered to try to make the bloody turkey because making herself the center of attention at the expense of everyone else there was just too tempting for such a vapid, self-involved person.", "My Mom destroyed every turkey she ever met. LOL\nShe was one of those who got up at 4am and cooked the damn thing all day long.  It was always dry. The soup she made was awesome though\n\nThe amount of time she spent intimidated me.  Imagine my surprise when I looked up how to make it. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nMy brothers still argue with me that I don't spend enough time on it.  \ud83d\ude44", "Based on what OP reported, her past behavior, their own reservations about her being assigned the task, it's a reasonable conclusion to think that this person is going to perform in a manner to be the star. They baked realistic cakes, do what do they do? They bring a freaking cake. I don't know the cousin and I saw that coming.  No, I am not the cousin. I am not that stupid. Where are you getting that I think the cousin was right? I think her behavior was totally self-centered, since she only thinks of what gets her the most shine. And her parents back her up in this foolishness. Based on this situation, wtf would anyone trust the cousin with anything.", "I simply maintain that this was practically setting the girl up to fail. OP was right - she did not understand the assignment. I just know far too many 18-22 year olds to be shocked at all by this story. It totally tracks.", "People do a lot of things for weird reasons. Especially when young. I maintain she shouldn\u2019t have been put in this position to begin with. OP is a little TA for being so obsessively negative about their cousin, but the real AHs are aunt and uncle here IMO.", "That\u2019s exactly it. And as a parent you gently ask - hey you got the Turkey under control? I have a few recipes that work - it was hard my first time so I relied upon the two recipes. That is much easier than  any and at that age I did it \u201cwith\u201d my mom so I learned how to do it just perfectly.", "My family ruined a lot of turkeys too!", "SHE PUT HERSELF IN THIS POSITION. What are you not getting? SHE agreed to participate in the draw, SHE accepted the assignment instead of using her words like the grown adult she\u2019s supposed to be. SHE continued to lie about it. No one forced a single thing on her. \n\nIt\u2019s bizarre to me that you\u2019re excusing her actions like she\u2019s some incompetent toddler. She\u2019s an adult capable of saying no. Instead, she said she\u2019d do it, continued to lie to everyone until the last second, and not because she was embarrassed. It was so she could make sure she was the center of everyone\u2019s attention, at the expense of all of them. \n\nWhy are the aunts and uncles assholes? If everyone in the family liked the way they assign dishes (INCLUDING THE COUSIN, WHO WAS THRILLED WITH HER ASSIGNMENT), then why does some rando on the internet thinking it\u2019s a bad idea make them assholes?\n\nEdit. Why on earth shouldn\u2019t OP be negative about the kind of lunatic that cuts off peoples hair as they sleep?", ">why does some rando on the internet thinking it\u2019s a bad idea make them assholes?\n\nMy dude, this is the entire point of AITA \n\nI\u2019m not that invested in this. I just disagree. I don\u2019t think OP is the AH at all. I think OP is frustrated for a thousand reasons that are valid. I simply think this anger is misplaced. They could see a thousand miles away this was going to happen. I place the blame on the aunt and uncle because a) they put pressure on OP\u2019s mom to keep hosting Christmas and b) when warned something could happen they assured OP it wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean, OP set up that cousin is kind of a screw up. This is not a shock that she did, in fact, screw up."]}
