Bullying someone constantly like she did to the point you had to change schools is abhorrent. Saying that you won't go to the funeral of the bully to support your sister who didn't support you during the bullying is a legitimate choice that is no way comparable and for them to claim that is mind boggling. Do what is right for you and your mental health, especially if you have the support of your parents and brother.", "Your grandparents are no better. \n\nNTA- you don\u2019t owe your sister anything.", "Then she chose her feelings about her friend over you. If there is a problem in your relationship with her, it is on her. Fair enough that she goes to the funeral, I get that.
