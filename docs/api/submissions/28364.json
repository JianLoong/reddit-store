I'm more friends with Dan since I've known him 15 years, but I've known Tina for 7 years. They have a 4yo daughter, Ally. Dan and Tina recently broke up and Tina wants to move back home to the west coast, we're all currently on the east coast. Naturally the topic of child custody for Ally came up while Dan was hanging out with my and my husband. Dan wants to propose that he and Tina each get 6 months of custody with Ally. Jan 1st-June 30th then July 1st-Dec 31st and it switches off like that every year. I asked what about Ally going to school next year? Dan said she'd be with one of them until end of December then fly across the country and spend the other half of the school year with the other parent.  I told Dan that idea is completely stupid and will never work. You can't uproot a kid in the middle of every school year. No judge with any common sense would ever sign off on that agreement. Plus, Ally needs a primary residence for school, doctors, and extracurriculars and anything else. Dan didn't like being told that and ended up leaving before dinner. My husband says while he understands my views I was really harsh. I personally feel that arrangements would be an absolute nightmare for Tina, especially as she gets older and doubt any court would allow it. I did text Dan to apologize for my wording, but no response yet.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I know I was harsh. I reacted to a surprisingly bad idea in a very poor manner. That said, that's been our friendship for years. We've always called each other out over things that were stupid or we didn't think through. Dan's called me out countless times and I have him.

Thank you for standing up. And it would make sense you'd show some shock in your response. It's a blatantly terrible parenting plan. If he was this way behind closed doors with his ex, I can see why they may have split. \n\nAnd if I might ask, did mom do most of the caretaking while they were together?", "NTA. Dude is an idiot and needed to be called out.

His idea is, of course, not workable in reality but his emotions are running high. He likely realised you were right but it's just another obstacle or difficulty in his life and he is overwhelmed.", "You are right. Unlikely the mother or judge would agree to that as it is not in the child's best interest. Schools do not follow the same educational plan and switching schools every 6 months would create big gaps in the child's education.\n\nYNA", "NTA- I'm the son of divorced parents and I feel like even going to a neighboring city that my dad lives in sickening (he's a good dad but he lives in the worst part of town.)

It means attending a different school every year. \n\nA better solution is one parent takes the kid for the year. The kid flys to see the other for all breaks of one week or more. \n\nYes, one parent would see the child less but the other idea harms the child.", "Nta that\u2019s stupid and detrimental to the child.

The difference between being a friend and being an enabler are these types of situations.\n\nYou told your long-time friend he was thinking about something in a seriously stupid way, and while harsh, what you said was true.

Six months is long enough to half-forget the parent on the other coast.  \n\nAnd with your lack of tact, you undermined any chance you had of bringing some sensible ideas to this situation.  And some advice that puts Ally first is really needed, she needs to be the first priority, for someone who is thinking about this.\n\nIt is a fraught situation for the parents.  Their conflict is with each other, and Ally is a counter for who has more points.  \n\nWhy don't they find one house, for her, and the parents take turns living there for six months with her, so she isn't facing living like a nomad for the next dozen or so years?  The parents would likely consider this a ridiculous way for them, as adults who understand and are choosing what is happening, to live, but somehow it's okay to impose on a four-year-old?  \n\nOr a ten-year-old?  Or a seventeen-year-old?  They need to think long-term.  Changing schools halfway through the year may work once, when she's in kindergarten, but it will be absolute hell for her as she gets older, has established friends, and is involved in extracurricular activities.\n\nThe parents need to figure out a sensible way for Ally to live.

Even uprooting them for vacations (e.g., summer vacation) is hard for the kid.", "You weren't harsh just to be harsh. You were harsh because the topical requires a harsh decision/thought process.\n\nHe can still have his daughter half of the time... just plan it around her school breaks. When she gets old enough to voice her opinion on where she wants to spend her time, allow her that. That's good parenting.", "NTA.  Essentially, your friends are doing what is mosst convenient for them without any thought to what is in the best interest of their child.

If he wants to co parent, then that can be arranged.", "ESH. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not feasible and it would be really damaging to the child, but your delivery makes you the AH. You can still be right while still being an AH.", "A little of both imo. While it's not your place to say you were informed of what the said plan was thus being able to offer an opinion. While it was harsh it is totally on point and sometimes you can't sugarcoat these things.", "NTA. That's an absolutely terrible custody idea and I doubt any judge would ever approve of it. Assuming the move goes through, what will happen is one parent gets primary custody and the other gets holidays. One of them will absolutely lose out more than the other but too bad for them. The child's needs come first.", "NTA. That wasn't harsh at all, men just can't stand hearing that something they thought is Real Genius Shit\u2122 is actually really friggin' stupid, especially when it's for reasons that take maybe 30 seconds of critical thinking to see. His custody arrangement would be great for a dog or cat, though.", "NTA - Only for caring.  \n\n\nBut really, its none of your business how they parent their kid. And they dont need a judge to sign anything. As parents, if its what they agree to do and theres no harm to the child, its their decision. No one elses.", "NTA.

Better he hear it from a friend then from a judge.", "NTA: The child should have the stable home and the parents should spend six months of the year in her house.", "Gentle YTA.

So you saying it can't work, you're just factually wrong. Now, it's unlikely the judge would order it if it's contested. But if they both agree to it, they can do it if they want. So telling him it's stupid, and can't ever work, you are just incorrect. It's also none of your business. He's probably at the lowest point he will ever be at, you're preoccupied with saying something to prove how smart you are (which ends up being wrong) and on top of that, you're not being the emotional supportive FRIEND he needs, you're just being an asshole.

You're right, it's a terrible plan in most instances, but there is homeschool and other options that could make it work. But whether right or not, you should not be weighing in on any divorce or custody issues between your two friends--just stay as far away from it as possible. If it's amicable, let them figure out things between themselves and if it's not then they likely have professionals advising them.  They don't need your input.", "YTA.

When they were a couple, she did more hands on parenting, but their circumstances have now changed, their not together and he is clearly willing to take on more of this role.\n\nSomething they will have to sort out themselves, but surely way more complex than \"that's how it always was, thats how it always should be\".", "So because he went to work and provided for their family he is a lesser parent in your eyes?", "And she will no longer be one.", "Or when she takes the kid to the opposite coast, enrolls her in school and then tries to switch up the custody agreement. \n\nOnce she has a home and a school and more present support system with the ex's family... it will be incredibly difficult for him to fight for full custody. His ex will so clearly be the primary parent I can't see any judge agreeing to remove her.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

On soooo many levels \n\nI think it's wrong for the mother to just up and take the child across the country,the child has memories and some small friends a room her toys her mom and her dad, I think uprooting  the child is the wrong thing to do also. \n\nThey both need to grow up and put the child first.", "We both made jabs at each other during stuff like bottle breaking and potty training.", "Thought I was replying to another human.", "I have never put together a parenting plan that gives each party physical custody for half the year, especially with school-age children. If they're in different parts of the country, one parent has the child for the entire school year, with the other parent having the child for all school holidays which are more than a single day (think Christmas vacation, spring break) and summer break. That's how we arrange it.", "Stability, not being uprooted from her school and friends, parents who put her best interests above their own wants.", "When I divorced my ex, I had primary custody and he had secondary custody. He had 3 weekends a month, every other holiday and summers were 1 week with me, 2 weeks with him. But we lived 30 minutes apart and once emotions settled down we worked together for the kids.", "They didn\u2019t say he was lesser, just that one parent will often take on the bulk of the parenting  due to work or other circumstances. Projecting much?", "Assuming you are a lawyer? That's what I'm expecting to happen in this situation.", "So frequently I see men be automatically assumed to be lesser parents. It\u2019s pervasive on this sub and frankly sickening.", "Yeah one parent will. Lucky for the mom the kid isn't in school yet because otherwise a judge might give primary to dad to keep them in the same school and close to whatever existing safety net the kid has. Mom will still have an uphill battle to get the kid under her full custody and moved. Most that do this wait to move until after they have primary custody and even then the other parent could stop it. \n\nFor example, in Florida you are legally required to get consent to move the kids unless you get a court order that they do not grant without *good* reason. In contrast, in Washington state the custodial parent has to legally inform then the other parent has 30 days to court up and stop it. \n\nThe current state has authority over the kid and there has to usually be a quality of life upgrade to uproot them. So this move with the kid might even be a pipe dream for the mom and op lit a fire under dads ass to lawyer up."]}
