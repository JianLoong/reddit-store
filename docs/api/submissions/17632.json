That\u2019s ridiculous of your grandparents and parents. You need to get this across to the adults and have qualified person do the caring rather than you, if the school doesn\u2019t have such a person then your family need to find him a place where there\u2019s such provision of care", "NTA if you're getting blamed for him pushing someone down the stairs because you were supposed to be responsible it makes sense to refuse to watch him from here on out. Now if something goes down they can't blame you. Also, they are parentifying you which isn't fair. You should not have to take care of an autistic teen as a teen.", "NTA\n\nI think that it's not your fault that he pushed the girl off. You are not his parents and you should not be included in this. If the family wants him to graduate and go to work, they should hire him professional teacher, who is educated and can deal with this. Also, why do the parents think it's a good idea to transfer him to YOUR school? You can't be there ALL THE TIME!!! Nonsense. Tell your parentd that you DO NOT want to babysit him, because school is there to learn something and make friends...etc. NOT to babysit someone. And you said you didn't have any friends growing up right? This is your chance to make friends. Idk if people want to be friends with you & your autistic uncle.. \n\nHope this helps, my English is not that good,but I hope you know what I mean.", "NTA your uncle needs to be in a school which can cater to his needs tell your school you don\u2019t feel comfortable or equipped to support your uncle", "NTA. It\u2019s your grandparents responsibility for his well-being.", "NTA\n\n He needs to be in a school that can look after him and his needs properly. You are not responsible for his actions, you are not his parent, you are not his legal guadrian. I can understand looking out for him, but this is extreme. Your grandparents need to step up and put him in a school that better suits him. They are being irresponsible. The girl who he pushed down the stairs may still be alive, but if he does it again....there is no guarantee. It should be worse.....", "NTA. Reach out to a guidance counselor or teacher about your concerns. It\u2019s the school\u2019s ob to manage him. And I would find a way to do college and early career out of my hometown.", "NTA - This is a huge responsibility to take on, so definitely NTA for feeling significant trepidation, and frustration, at being asked to do this.\n\nYes, your uncle experiences barriers to learning and socialising that are greater than yours, but it shouldn't be forgotten that you are also in your final year of High School - an important and fun, but also, often, trying and confusing time for everyone. To be asked to manage your uncle's school routine as well as your own is no small thing.\n\nYou haven't said whether your own parents are in the picture and what they think? Do you have their support? Maybe try to sit down with your grandparents and explain that you're very happy to look out for your uncle when in school, and to support in some ways (only you know what your boundaries are), but that, as it's also your final year and you have things you want to accomplish, you don't feel you can support in all of the ways that are being asked of you.", "Absolutely NTA, and you need to shut this down.  Go to your guidance counselor or school office and request that he be removed from your classes. It is not your responsibility to look after him and make him behave and it's unfair that your family is expecting you to.", "NTA. The adults in your family are putting too much pressure on you to control uncontrollable forces. You're a really sweet person to work so hard to help your family, but you aren't qualified for the job (helping people like your uncle is a job that adults are paid to do).  \n\n\nEdit: Literally too much literally.", "NTA. Do you have a trusted teacher or counsellor who you can talk to about this?", "NTA. Honestly it sounds like he shouldn\u2019t be in a mainstream school anyway.", "NTA forcing you a minor, to do this job is o\nparentification, which is a crime. It's a parents job to attend to him, or failing that, finding another adult teacher or minder to help him.\n\nYou deserve a life. The time for you to sacrifice your happiness is if and when you have your own children.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I\u2019m really sorry about your predicament but this is not fair to you. You seem pretty young yourself so this is a huge thing to ask. Taking care of another human is *not* a basic thing to do. Your uncle needs to be in an environment that can better care for him and assist in his development and you deserve the full educational experience of being in school, making friends, learning, finding your interests etc. This is not your job.", "NTA how old are you and where are your parents\u00df", "How could you have been his babysitter since elementary when you talk about his previous schooling?", "NTA.\n\nHow would it be your fault that your uncle pushed another girl down a flight of stairs? If this behavior is as normal as I'm getting from this story, then he needs to be institutionalized or something before he kills someone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because if you are he needs an IEP/504 plan. The SCHOOL should be accommodating and supervising him. \n\nNTA though.", "NTA\n\nThe responsibility for looking after your uncle at school, home or anywhere else for that matter should not be placed on you. If his behaviours mean that he needs someone to be with him all day, then your grandparents should be applying for that support themselves via the school instead of relying on you.\n\nSince you haven\u2019t told your family how you\u2019re feeling yet, I would as gently as possible inform them that you don\u2019t want to be your uncle\u2019s caretaker. Not only do you want to enjoy your final year of high school with your friends, you will also be working hard for your exams and having to look after him is going to distract you from that.", "NTA. You are not his parent and shouldn\u2019t have to handle all of this at your age. Also you definitely should not be blamed for anything he does. By them putting this all on you they are teaching him not to take responsibility for his actions. One of the worst things you can do for people who are neurodiverse is teach them it\u2019s ok to act however they like and use \u201cI\u2019m autistic\u201d as an excuse. I\u2019m so sorry you are in this situation. Is there someone in the family who you can go to that will stick up for you?", "NTA. You\u2019re still a kid and another adult is not your responsibility. I\u2019m sorry your family is trying to put this on you.", "I hate it when adults put their responsibility on children. He needs a trained professional work him.", "HE pushed a girl down the stairs and you got some of the blame? He need to be in specialized classes for kids with learning disabilities, if that\u2019s social or academic. I was in one due to my adhd and missing a lot of school due to surgery the first years. I knew a kid that chased me with a metal bat to hit me. \nTalk with the school about what your family is pressuring you to do and tell them about that accident so it will be taken more seriously.\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA. And absolutely NOT your responsibility.\n\nSend an email to your parents, your grandparents, and the principal of the school. TELL them that he is not your responsibility and that you will NOT be taking care of him. \n\nYou shouldn't feel bad at all! You should never have been made to take care of him. Ever. You have a right to enjoy school. Plus, he needs care and supervision that you cannot provide.", "NTA. You are still a teen yourself. You should not have the responsibility to look after someone else. That is your uncle's parents role. Stick to your boundaries. Talk to a trusted teacher. He is not your responsibility, he is the responsibility of his parents and the school.", "NTA.  This is called parentification.  It\u2019s on his guardians to watch out for him, not you.", "NTA. Try not to feel bad. Hes not your child, hes not your responsibility. If there is anything youd be willing to do, maybe a couple hrs of scheduled study time a wk, or transportation to & from school, i think that would be generous of you, and a kindness to your uncle. But its unreasonable to put any pressure or responsibility on you. Maybe also talk to your school and explain your predicament. When my daughter and i moved to the town my nieces lived in i asked her school if she could be put in a class with one of them, and they said no, they keep family members separate for this reason.", "Nta. Please go talk to the school.  It's not appropriate to have you assigned as his caregiver.  He needs someone certified.", "Why can\u2019t his parents take him to school and back and help him with homework ?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he shouldn't be in a mainstream school if he needs that much help. \n\nYou need to speak to someone at your school that you trust about the situation.", "Hello! My parents also want me to look after him, since they feel bad that he got bullied in his previous school, and also because they\u2019re trying to respect my grandparents. I tried telling them that I simply can\u2019t just be his caregiver but they don\u2019t seem to care about my personal life. As for my grandparents, I don\u2019t know if I can tell them this. They were so used to me being my uncle\u2019s support in school that they never really thought of my own opinion about it and it sucks knowing that I\u2019ll be missing out on a lot (especially when it comes to hanging out with friends)", "Right? OP needs an adult on their side to advocate for them. The parents/grandparents are doing a poor job of taking care of OP's needs.", "Hi! yes, I\u2019m actually 15 and 9th grade was the only time I actually had a circle of friends that I could hang out with after school. They expect me to teach him about commuting or helping him adjust to our school activities (We have a lot of school work and online work which might overwhelm him). It\u2019s super hard trying to explain my situation to my parents because they were so used to the idea of me babysitting him when we were in elementary school. I keep telling them I can\u2019t be there for him every time but they don\u2019t seem to care about my own personal life (sorry for the bad english!)", "Hi! from 2nd grade to 6th grade, I was in the same school as him, looking after him. For the first years of highschool, we went to separate schools (I have a few friends now, and my main worry is that I won\u2019t get to hang out with them once my uncle transfers). Now that I\u2019m in my last year of hs, that\u2019s when he\u2019s transferring to my class this year (sorry if my english is bad or if i explained it badly! It\u2019s not my first language.)", "Hi! No, I don\u2019t live in the US, I live in a country where there\u2019s no such thing as Individualized Education. We have Special Education where kids with disabilities all learn together, but my grandparents enroll him to my schools because they say he\u2019s smart enough for it", "Ah I see, that makes complete sense. If you don't feel that you can talk to your grandparents directly, maybe try speaking to your parents again and see if they can understand your perspective, and then maybe they can calmly put your feelings forward to your grandparents?\n\nSay exactly what you said in your post: that you love your uncle, that you want him to thrive and do well, and that you've been happy to support him over the years, however, as you go into your final year, the responsibility of managing both his and your own time, routine and workload, as well as being expected to semi-manage his behaviour (prevent him from being physical again), is making you feel stressed. I'm sure they'll want to support you if/when they understand that this is preying on your mind.", "Yeah, these expectations are really unfair. You have a right to enjoy your childhood with your friends without the constant stress of having to watch out for and prevent your uncle from behaving badly. \n\nYour grandparents really need to be looking into getting proper support for him at school instead of relying on you all the time. Can you talk to someone at school about how you\u2019re feeling?", "Refuse to watch him and speak to the school. During school hours it's the school's responsibility to watch him. And after school it's his parents' responsibility.", "Where are they?? They are his parents. Let them accompany him or hire a professional. What happens when he pushes someone and they get hurt? Or he pushes you? They are setting you up as a scapegoat to shirk responsibility and accountability. They should be ashamed of themselves.", "Smart isn't the issue, it's his wildly inappropriate behavior. I'm autistic and there is *nothing* about autism that excuses **pushing someone down the stairs**?? That's so incredibly violent, he could have killed her! You are not you uncle's keeper and he needs serious intervention."]}
