If the family wants him to graduate and go to work, they should hire him professional teacher, who is educated and can deal with this. Also, why do the parents think it's a good idea to transfer him to YOUR school? You can't be there ALL THE TIME!!! Nonsense. Tell your parentd that you DO NOT want to babysit him, because school is there to learn something and make friends...etc. NOT to babysit someone.

You are not responsible for his actions, you are not his parent, you are not his legal guadrian. I can understand looking out for him, but this is extreme.
