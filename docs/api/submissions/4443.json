Names have also been changed.\n\nI (37f) am currently living with my oldest of four brothers (50m, 47m, 44m, and 41m) while I am doing residency for an MD. My brothers take a cruise together every year. It's not that I'm not invited, I'm at residency and am flat broke, and am living with my brother rent free. They were on the cruise last week and were supposed to be home this weekend.\n\nI got a call from my youngest brother, Levi, telling me that my oldest brother, Gabe, was in a waterskiing accident a couple days ago. He'd been trying to call me to let me know, but reception in the islands is spotty at best, and he finally got hold of me today. Apparently, Gabe has a pretty serious lung and head injury and they weren't even sure if he would survive until this morning. They airlifted Gabe to a hospital in Texas to stabilize him, and once he's stable enough they'll airlift him to a hospital closer to where him and I live. Levi was able to catch a doctor long enough, and the doctor explained some of the situation to me, and being in the field I understand how serious this situation could turn at a moment's notice.\n\nLevi had also been trying to get hold of our mother, but for reasons stated above he hadn't been able to reach her. I called her and let her know what was going on. I don't know if she didn't understand the gravity of the situation, but the first thing she asked was when she could plan for us coming in for Christmas. I told her I didn't think we would be coming for Christmas unless things changed drastically for Gabe, but I wasn't going to chance his health and healing on anything.\n\nMy mother started ranting about how I was overreacting, and things like this happen all the time to him and he would be fine. Gabe has been on many cruises, and this is the first time he's ever hurt himself, much less ended up in the ICU. I pointed this out to my mother, who continued to complain that I was overreacting, everything would be fine, and we would leave her alone on Christmas. My two middle brothers still fully intend to be there for Christmas with their wives and children, and my aunts will be there with their grandchildren. I'm not sure where my mother is getting it that she'll be \"alone.\"\n\nAt this point I was fed up with my mother and proceeded to tell her I felt like she was being unfair, unreasonable, and extremely selfish. My brothers all seem to agree with me, but my aunt texted me saying I really hurt my mom's feelings. So, Reddit, I come to you: AITA for calling my mother unreasonable?\n\nTLDR: My brother was seriously hurt in a waterskiing accident, and I would prefer to stay with him and make sure he is okay for Christmas.

For my mom, I think that the idea of her own mortality, and the fact that she has relatively little time left, scares her.  And she certainly is scared about the health of her loved ones.  So when an issue she doesn't want to deal with appears (and scares her), she twists and turns it around in her mind until she (consciously  or not) comes up with something that she can actually verbalize and have a reaction to, no matter how inappropriate or unrelated to what actually happened.\n\nThis stuff scares my mom, and maybe yours, too.  It usually takes my time and patience, and explaining and co-opting relatives to the cause, to deal with the situation.\n\nMy best and hopeful thoughts are with your brother and you.", "Sounds like you know what you're talking about.
