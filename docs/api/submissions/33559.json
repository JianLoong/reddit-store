What a slap in the face that would be to your 17 year old. She worked hard and saved her own money for it (when she could\u2019ve spent it on clothes, food, literally anything) and then your younger daughter just gets it for free? \n\nNot to mention, as you said, it being significantly more expensive. \n\nWhen I personally was 11-14 (I\u2019m 22 now), I thought everyone was judging me for not having a smartphone, or an iPad touch or whatever, but trust me, nobody cared. But kids that age are so obsessed with comparing what they have to their friends. \n\nI\u2019d consider proposing a way your daughter could EARN it, such as doing a large amount of chores around the house, getting As in school, maybe saving up some birthday money too, but I wouldn\u2019t make it a Christmas gift.", "NTA\n\nIn my own opinion and basing this on my own life, I think MacBooks are only more useful for high school and college. I got my first PC in middle school and had another one in high school. College is when I got my first MacBook Pro and it got worked hard for college. Got another one for grad school and then just have one as I got older. She doesn\u2019t need three computers. Tell her no and once she\u2019s older, you can discuss it but right now she doesn\u2019t need a thousand plus MacBook because her friends do. \n\nYour daughter has a chrome book. That\u2019s a laptop and it\u2019s functional right now. The only reason that she wants one is cause she sees the kids with someone shiny and new. She can do anything she can on a MacBook with a Chromebook.", "NTA\n\nThis is a case of classic materialism. She doesn\u2019t need one, but her friends and sibling have one, so she feels entitled to one. Good for you for standing firm and teaching her some important life lessons.", "Nta.  The 11 yr old can get one if she pays for it.  If that takes till she's 17 then so be it.   What about the fairness to the 17yr old who wasn't given one.  \n\nWhat about the younger kids? When does it stop?  Seems like a great opportunity to talk to your kid about keeping up.with the joneses", "NTA since it\u2019s literally a $1200 gift. It\u2019d be really nice, yes, but she doesn\u2019t NEED a macbook so much as she just wants it. Is it possible to get her a slightly nicer computer?", "Info: does your wife also want to let your 11 year old drive a car right now?", "NTA, if the slow Chromebook is really a problem, there are a ton of good windows laptops that are more powerful and useful, but are not near the price of a MacBook Air. Or maybe there are some good second hand deals. \nRegardless there is a valuable moment here to teach your kid about being content with what they have, and to teach them that not everyone can afford expensive new things. And the fact that your 17 year old can work for it and the 11 year old can\u2019t is a rather weak argument, the 17 year old was also 11 once and you didn\u2019t give her expensive stuff you could t really afford either. Times do change, but not in the way that somehow everyone needs an expensive laptop.", "NTA. She has no idea of the real value of money. Also the \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one made fun of\u201d tells you it\u2019s not really about the computer itself. What will be next?", "NTA, your reasoning is valid. I think it\u2019s important to affirm to her that even though it\u2019s easier said than done, any kids who would make fun of her are not people she should pay mind to. Buying a $1000+ MacBook so she can \u201cfit in\u201d enables her to link her self worth to materialistic things. \n\nI will also say that as someone who attended a middle/high school where we were provided MacBook Airs, kids would drop and break them CONSTANTLY. There\u2019s no problem with waiting until she\u2019s older, more responsible, or demonstrates a significant need for the technology to consider buying her one.", "I was in this situation when I was young, except my little brother got everything I had to save and pay for myself.\nDO NOT BUDGE.\n\nYour 17 year old will not forgive you and even start to resent you in the long term.", "NTA\n\nAlso, she may not have a job, but you could suggest to her that she save up her birthday/christmas money for one. My parents didnt have a lot of money, so thats what we did. If we got a gift card to somewhere we werent too interested in (like walmart or target), our parents would \"buy\" the gift card off of us since they would use it towards groceries, etc. Mac books are expensive, so it will take a while, but that way she can decide if she really wants one.", "NTA. I\u2019m 15, and an owner of a MacBook Air myself. My parents bought it for me after my cheap old school laptop decided to stop working. I offered to pay for majority as I do have a job through the week but they said they\u2019d pay the whole thing as I needed it for school. I am extremely lucky that my parents could and were willing to afford it, but If it wasn\u2019t used for school then I don\u2019t see why you should buy such an expensive laptop, especially for your kid who isn\u2019t in high school just yet.", "Obviously NTA. I was over 40 when I first got a MacBook Pro. \n\nAt 11, your daughter can do some light jobs - to earn her way to the \u2018trophy\u2019 laptop. Maybe next Christmas a mini iPad. Very few young children actually **need** a professional laptop. She simply wants a Mac Bragbook.  Stand firm, Dad. You\u2019re absolutely correct.", "NTA. It's not expected to get a child an adult's tool, that comes at an adult price. If you have reservations about the ability for your 11yo to be responsible with expensive kit, then trust your instincts. If it's about money, trust your instincts. My parents borrowed money to purchase my first computer that got me on the path of tech and cybersec when no-one had a computer at home. It was  $5,273.78 in today's money and I was 15. I eventually paid them back but not in today's money.", "NTA - don't feed into the apple shame that people try to force on others.\n\nAlso I know school has changed alot since I was there, but I can't possibly see how a 12 year old needs a lap top for school", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe 11 year old needs to learn that she won't get something just because other have it. She has a computers at her disposal to use and it would be unfair to other if she'd get 1200$ macbook.  \n\n\nYou can give a way to earn at least part of the money for macbook in terms of giving her money if she helps out with chores. That way she can get macbook although much later and it teaches her importance of saving and being smart with her money.", "NTA oldest bought it from her own money so the youngest should do the same. Tell her you cannot always get what you want. You need to work hard for it.", "NTA\n\nEven if you're swimming in money, she doesn't need it.", "NTA.  If her friends make fun of her over something like that, they're not worth having as friends in the first place.  Better she find that out now than later.", "She's 11. She doesn't need a new MacBook or whatever electronic device is in now just because everyone has one. Your oldest has one because she bought it, and in high school, she needs more advanced devices for her school work and assignments. she'll be fine with what she has. don't let your wife bully you into buying one. nta", "Nope, NTA. \n\nI would not buy a Mac anything for a 12 year old. The don\u2019t understand the concept of the value of an item like that and the consequences of what dropping a MacBook whatever on the concrete would mean to them. \n\nI work in IT, every week an ADULT drops a $1000+ company laptop and breaks it. We then have to prepare a replacement and transfer their data to the new computer and arrange for the repair of the damaged one. I\u2019ve worked in IT for 11 years, it\u2019s job security, but it does get old.\n\nMy youngest, (at 12!) dropped her first cellphone in a river and was in inconsolable for days afterwards. I was able to getting it working after a battery replacement. But we made her wait because we\u2019d told her to leave it in the car.\n\nIf your wife disagrees, tell your wife she can pay for it and then stand back and wait because you already know what will happen.", "I am a P.C. guy so I am biased . Anything Apple sells is overpriced and unless you are doing video editing , it\u2019s not worth it . Even with video editing , you can find a P.C. that can do the same or beat it .", "As the oldest child I resented working for all I had like my cell phone (even paid my own bill) while my brothers had all of it handed to them and paid for at a younger age without working for it. Unless it\u2019s something that is absolutely needed then absolutely NTA. \n\nAnything a child works for and earns should not be a factor in making a decision for another sibling. \n\nMy oldest got a phone last year at 12 earlier than I had anticipated because of what she was going through at her other parent\u2019s house. I wanted to give her access to call for an emergency whether it was me or someone else. My middle child asks when she can have a phone. I\u2019ve decided 12 as well as I want to be fair across the board.", "Lmao fuck no. Unless ur kid is like genius level. Do not buy them a macbook just because.", "NTA.  But not very imaginative.  Put her to work doing chores with no fixed payment schedule, but that she knows there is one.  When she reaches the point where she understands the value of productive work, she gets the macbook.  If you tell her the goal she will tell you everyday that she has learned.  You will have to be artful, encouraging, informative, not critical for this to work.  You can do it, dad.", "NTA. She doesn't need it, she wants it and we all know why a kid wants a mac book.", "NAH - honestly, I spent a lot of money (my own, saved slowly) on Apple products as a pre-teen and I got wayyy more out of the experience then than I do now. It\u2019s not wrong to want something purely for the aesthetic and it\u2019s fine to want something pretty of your own, even if it\u2019s a bit frivolous. I was completely hooked on upgrading to the latest and greatest every year when I was 12; today I use the iPhone 8 and a 2009 MacBook. If she\u2019s been good all year and you can afford it I don\u2019t see why not!", "Massive yes to being an asshole. You should buy a child a mac book when they are born.", "NTA\n\nStop your children from making Apple or whatever their identity.\n\nTeach your kid to build a personality so she doesn't need to use useless electronics to validate her existence.\n\nI feel like this is one of those moments that will greatly impact how she is in the future with her personality\n\nWhat do I know though, I'm on reddit \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really needed as much as wanted.\n\nBUT, if you both were willing to compromise a little, could you look for a used and slightly older version? It would be far cheaper, she\u2019d still have a MacBook, just not the latest and greatest.\n\nIf that compromise is not good for her, then it\u2019s just because she wants the shiny new thing. If it\u2019s really about having a better tool at her disposal, then second hand will give her that. Just be sure to get something that\u2019s just new enough not to need replacing too soon.", "So do 11 year olds hang out and have laptop parties?  Does she say,\u201dI\u2019m going to Becky\u201ds house to study\u201d with her Chromebook in her backpack? If the answer is no, I\u2019m thinking BS.  \n\nThe only way I could justify the purchase is if it\u2019s required for school, but that would\u2019ve come up in September.  Stand your ground", "NTA. I supervise several IT engineers across 15 school districts. My first question when talking about this would be, what does the school recommend? If the school recommends a chromebook or issues Chromebooks to the students, that\u2019s what you get her. If they insist on a MacBook Air, then you get her one of those. Windows? That\u2019s fine, too.\n\nThe problem with getting a middle school student any device is that it *will* get broken. And a MacBook is an expensive device to have to replace. Any damage to an out of coverage MacBook Air costs $500 to fix. Two problems at the same time and you\u2019re paying for a new one. So if you did choose to buy one you need Apple Care on the device, and even then you have deductibles.\n\nSo if the school recommends a chromebook, then there\u2019s no reason to go any further than that right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We waste a lot of class time trying to log in to things.", "NTA, though if your kid is interesting in expanding proficiency with computers beyond the basics I would recommend working with them toward building something (assuming they're willing to go with something other than a macbook, as they make terrible starter computers.) I built my first system around that age using second-hand partsband the experience went a long way toward influencing my future career path in lucrative ways.", "NTA - tell her if its speed you need, b/c she doesn't want to use a slow chromebook go get her a nice new (to her) Lenovo T480s quad core with no OS for under $150 off ebay and slap a blazing fast copy of Linux (Mint, Ubuntu, MX, or POP) on it.  Fastest machine in the class", "NTA offer to help design a savings plan. It\u2019s okay to tell kids no, in fact, it supports them in developing critical skills.", "NTA, I\u2018m 22 and a teaching student and I bought my MacBook as well from the money I saved up (just like my sister did as well). Apart from the fact that it would be unfair to the oldest the 11 year old already has options to do online homework/assignments on, even if they aren\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d. If she wants a MacBook so bad you could giver her options to get the money for it, for example instead of having traditional christmas gifts she gets money that she can put towards the MacBook.", "Pretty sure I saw this same post last week, but OP's cake day is today.  I noticed because I recognized that the kid's age changed between the subject and the first sentence last time too.", "NTA. I remember getting Sandisk media players while everyone else was getting iPods. My life has been wholly unaffected the entire 2 decades later.", "NTA but your wife's favoritism makes her an AH.  Absolutely not - do not get the 11 YO a macbook when your 17YO had to pay for it herself.  If you do this - it would make you a supreme a-hole.", "NTA. \n\nJudging by how many broken school Chromebooks I\u2019ve \u201cbought\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t trust my kids (9 and 10) with a MacBook. \n\nMaybe one of those bomb-proof military computers.", "Well spank my bottom, does she want the newest I phone to go along with it?! Lol, NTA", "I know a Mac has its uses but I will never understand why it's treated as if it's some sort of fashion accessory especially by younger people.\nI don't even have a Mac and I'm 29! \n(Not that I need a Mac but it's really, really, really expensive in my country.. think of saving your salary 3-6 times. Maybe later on if I have saved enough or don't have other stuff to worry about)\nIf the Chromebook is really a problem,  there are far better Windows laptops out there.\nIf she really wants a Mac, she should save up or work for it.", "I'm going NTA \n\n*But*, I'd ask her what she specifically wants to do with it. A Chromebook is good for the basics but is she wanted to do something the Chromebook can't and thus the interest? Or is it just her friends having one that makes her want one. I as a kid wanted a computer to develop code and didn't want to mess around with that on the family computer for fear of breaking it.  \nThe Chromebook can code, but maybe for her it's an interest in editing, or some more intense art, etc. I'm not sure. But I'd show her that you are taking the why of it all into your decision, it helps her understand why you make the choice.", "> make it a Christmas g\n\nAll of the above.   \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nBut if she really wants it, next year. She's works around the house, 'earns' money with throwing garbage away, cleaning windows/cars/house/rooms/etc...\n\nMy son has a better PC then me, he 'worked' and saved his money, I only payed the better upgrades (birthday), he did most of the work himself.", "This is what I came here to say. If the 11 year old wants one then maybe come up with a chore/allowance list so they can earn money around the house and save up to buy one. But it would be grossly unfair to the 17 year old to buy a computer for their younger sibling given that they had to save up for one", "I don't think they should buy her the mac book for the reasons everyone's covered.\n\nWhat I want to add onto though is the comment about the 17 year old.\n\nIf OP did decide to buy their kid a mac book I think they should also reimburse the 17 year old.\n\n(Eventually every kid should be handed a macbook or it's cash value against something else if they are happy with something else.)", "My husband has a MacBook and barely uses it. He uses his work laptop as a personal laptop over the MacBook. I used the Chromebook when I was in HS and it was more than efficient, NTA.", "I'm surprised she has her own computer. She's 11. She shouldn't have a phone at that age, much less a laptop or Chromebook.", "I agree with your assessment on whether the parent is an asshole or not (NTA) but a Chromebook and a macbook are *far* from able to do the same things. ChromeOS is basically a glorified web browser. Chromebooks can be used to do a very limited range of things like some basic office tasks in addition to consuming content.", "I don't think the kid will accept anything else but macbook since her main argument was \"because rest of the kids have them\".  \n\n\nI agree that Chromebooks are basically e-waste but I don't think the kid will be happy with just some nicer laptop.", "I don\u2019t even spend that on myself. My laptop which has great specs for watching tv and movies from, only ran me about $800 I think. I have a love of asus.", "lol yeah the work comment was really weird for an 11 year old", "I did the entire Pandemic lockdown wfh for 12 hours a day...using a now 10 year old ASUS laptop. It still works fine. I honestly don't get what a Macbook would do that is so much better than my workhorse that has allowed me to Zoom, create class videos and course materials,  watch movies and entertainment, get new certifications for work, and so on.   Does a Macbook give you a free back massage or something? What am I missing?", "students absolutely need laptops for school. i\u2019m in grad school now, but i was using a laptop from either 6th or 7th grade for my assignments. my schools did not provide them\n\nthat being said, she absolutely does not need a macbook. i used PCs throughout middle school until i started grad school. i started with a cheap one and when i showed an interest on coding, my parents bought me an expensive pc that lasted 6 years. i upgraded to a macbook in my 20s. she needs a laptop and i don\u2019t necessarily think chromebooks are the best option but she 100% does not need a $1200 macbook", "It's been a long while since I've been in school but I've heard a lot of parents at work saying that most of the homework and school projects needs to be submitted via some online portal.  \n\n\nSo it's good that the kid has Chromebook so she doesn't have to fight over family iMac when she needs to do her homework.", "I'm the younger kid and my parents were RUTHLESS about making sure that exactly what you described never happened.  If my sister had to buy it herself, so did I, except I at least got handmedowns.  My mom would calculate Christmas budgets to the PENNY.  So sometimes we'd find change in the bottom of one of our stockings, which was the leftover stuff to make sure we got exactly the same dollar amount for Christmas.  \n\nIt seems bananas and I think my mom was a little nuts, but you know what? My sister and I never argued about any of that stuff and I knew better than to ask my mom to violate the budget and my sister and I have a fantastic relationship today.", "So that they could practise before using a real computer?", "Bite for all kids not only for the 11 year old to be fair. NTA op", "This really doesn't mean anything though.  I've been working technology for decades, and at my last job I turned in my work Windows laptop and just used my personal MacBook for both personal things and work.  \n\nYou should use the system that works best for you, doesn't matter what it is.", "Most schools kids use chrome books every day. Some schools provide the students with computers but they are slow and break very easily. It's easier for a child to have their own computer now. Especially when Some schools don't let students bring home the school issued chromebooks. Stuff saves easier on a personal one also. It's also easier for a parent to monitor one they bought for their child and approve of.", "You do realise kids need computers for school work nowadays? My sisters school required them to have a tablet for class work", "Okay grandpa", "My nephew is 11 and is already doing basic coding on his laptop. Kids that age have skills if they have the technology to do it. But I wouldn\u2019t get an 11-year-old an airbook.", "A 12 year old doesn\u2019t need to be doing much.", "I think the Chromebook is fine for a 11 year old I could get her a windows laptop for her 12th birthday but she's adamant on getting a mac", "Fellow ASUS fan.  Reliable as heck and sturdy.", "My Acer is almost nine years old and launches rather fast, wouldn't believe it's age. I haven't even bought a new SSD in it. \n\nMacbooks looks shiny and cool, they're thin and I guess their op is designed to look smooth when used.", "Man I must be old then haha.  I didn't need a lap top for school until I was in college haha", "Yeah I guess that's true most work is submitted online but like you said she has a chrome book.  MacBook at that age would just be a status symbol", "I\u2019m not to that extreme as I am too lazy to calculate an exact. However I do try to stay within a certain dollar range so it is still fair. I know my kids aren\u2019t thinking about that value, but would definitely think about less gifts. To them they would be more upset if they got 1 gift valued at $500 while their siblings got 10 valued at $50 lol. But kudos to your parents for always making sure things are equal!!", ">You should use the system that works best for you, doesn't matter what it is.\n\nWhile I agree with this, as an adult, there's definitely something to be said for learning to use the tech you're provided. Especially as a kid.", "Doesn't the school provide those if it's required?", "I'm 29. I know schools by me provide them. I've seen them left outside.", "They don't *need* to, but that doesn't mean they can't handle starting to get into more advanced tasks. That's a good age to start getting into more artistic hobbies like photography and photo editing, video editing, and so on. It's also a good time to start learning the basics of programming. A parent isn't obligated to foster these things, but it does set your kids up to be more well rounded later in life. It's about the age range of a STEM program I used to volunteer at before the pandemic hit.", "The Chromebook usually comes with really weak CPU so depending on the model it might be slow that's all I'm saying.  \n\n\nYou can maybe find some older intel based Macbook air that you could get cheaper although it still will be used and not as new and shiny, but I'm with both FlyingBox566 and you that she doesn't really need laptop that is that expensive.  \n\n\nAlthough it was different age I haven't had my own laptop until I was 18.", "She sounds spoiled. I\u2019m guessing your wife babies her", "INFO: Your wife seems to think that the 11 year old needs it and the 17 year old has one that she paid for. No mention about teh 14 year old. Not accusing you of anything just find it funny the middle child isnt mentioned at all :P", "lmao things changed quickly! outside of math class, pretty much all of my assignments were completed using a laptop. my last couple years of high school, teachers let us use laptops in class to take notes instead of pen & paper", "no, not all schools. i graduated in 2016 but i can\u2019t think of a single assignment outside of math class that i could do without a laptop. the school didn\u2019t provide that, my parents had to buy one for me.", "Not necessarily. Some school districts do not buy devices for students. The 1:1 concept is relatively new.", "nope. not every school. my first high school and middle school we could only use our assigned laptops when our teachers checked out a cart. if we had assignments online outside of class, we either had to figure out how to get to the library (we weren\u2019t really allowed to go to them much) or use a computer at home. which not everyone has because they can be expensive", "but it\u2019s not like that everywhere. my second high school gave us laptops for home. my entire senior year it refused to connect to my home wifi, and they never paid any mind when you reported issues. i spent 3 weeks waiting. finally had to give up and use my personal laptop, then when it broke, i had to figure out how to get another because my school still hadn\u2019t answered any of my tickets", ">It's also a good time to start learning the basics of programming.\n\nAll of the programming and stem classes at my son's school use Chromebooks (Tynker, specifically). I get the point you're making and agree that a personal Macbook is certainly going to be more powerful than the prorated district-wide chromebooks that have been in circulation for a few years but these kids aren't doing much GPU intensive work at that age and if they are, it's in the computer lab with a proper PC.", "yeah, it looks like you can get a refurbished intel macbook for under $500.\n\nwill it be what the 12 yr old wants? probably not.\n\nbut maybe- it depends if they really know the difference or if what matters is the logo. \n\ncuz yeah, i was behind a 12 yr old at the phone repair store last night and the kid told his mom that they'd need to take his phone to the apple store to get fixed because that store couldn't fix the back panel and have it keep it's apple logo. he ***needed*** the apple. (his mom did tell him fine but that he got to come for that excursion to.)", "Damn I feel old hahaha", "I meant like loan them. The district by me does."]}
