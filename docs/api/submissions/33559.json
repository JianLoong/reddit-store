What a slap in the face that would be to your 17 year old. She worked hard and saved her own money for it (when she could\u2019ve spent it on clothes, food, literally anything) and then your younger daughter just gets it for free? \n\nNot to mention, as you said, it being significantly more expensive. \n\nWhen I personally was 11-14 (I\u2019m 22 now), I thought everyone was judging me for not having a smartphone, or an iPad touch or whatever, but trust me, nobody cared. But kids that age are so obsessed with comparing what they have to their friends. \n\nI\u2019d consider proposing a way your daughter could EARN it, such as doing a large amount of chores around the house, getting As in school, maybe saving up some birthday money too, but I wouldn\u2019t make it a Christmas gift.", "NTA\n\nIn my own opinion and basing this on my own life, I think MacBooks are only more useful for high school and college. I got my first PC in middle school and had another one in high school. College is when I got my first MacBook Pro and it got worked hard for college. Got another one for grad school and then just have one as I got older. She doesn\u2019t need three computers. Tell her no and once she\u2019s older, you can discuss it but right now she doesn\u2019t need a thousand plus MacBook because her friends do. \n\nYour daughter has a chrome book. That\u2019s a laptop and it\u2019s functional right now. The only reason that she wants one is cause she sees the kids with someone shiny and new. She can do anything she can on a MacBook with a Chromebook.", "NTA\n\nThis is a case of classic materialism. She doesn\u2019t need one, but her friends and sibling have one, so she feels entitled to one. Good for you for standing firm and teaching her some important life lessons.", "Nta.  The 11 yr old can get one if she pays for it.  If that takes till she's 17 then so be it.   What about the fairness to the 17yr old who wasn't given one.  \n\nWhat about the younger kids? When does it stop?  Seems like a great opportunity to talk to your kid about keeping up.with the joneses", "NTA since it\u2019s literally a $1200 gift. It\u2019d be really nice, yes, but she doesn\u2019t NEED a macbook so much as she just wants it. Is it possible to get her a slightly nicer computer?", "Info: does your wife also want to let your 11 year old drive a car right now?", "NTA, if the slow Chromebook is really a problem, there are a ton of good windows laptops that are more powerful and useful, but are not near the price of a MacBook Air. Or maybe there are some good second hand deals. \nRegardless there is a valuable moment here to teach your kid about being content with what they have, and to teach them that not everyone can afford expensive new things. And the fact that your 17 year old can work for it and the 11 year old can\u2019t is a rather weak argument, the 17 year old was also 11 once and you didn\u2019t give her expensive stuff you could t really afford either. Times do change, but not in the way that somehow everyone needs an expensive laptop.", "NTA. She has no idea of the real value of money. Also the \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one made fun of\u201d tells you it\u2019s not really about the computer itself. What will be next?", "NTA, your reasoning is valid. I think it\u2019s important to affirm to her that even though it\u2019s easier said than done, any kids who would make fun of her are not people she should pay mind to. Buying a $1000+ MacBook so she can \u201cfit in\u201d enables her to link her self worth to materialistic things. \n\nI will also say that as someone who attended a middle/high school where we were provided MacBook Airs, kids would drop and break them CONSTANTLY. There\u2019s no problem with waiting until she\u2019s older, more responsible, or demonstrates a significant need for the technology to consider buying her one.", "I was in this situation when I was young, except my little brother got everything I had to save and pay for myself.\nDO NOT BUDGE.\n\nYour 17 year old will not forgive you and even start to resent you in the long term.", "NTA\n\nAlso, she may not have a job, but you could suggest to her that she save up her birthday/christmas money for one. My parents didnt have a lot of money, so thats what we did. If we got a gift card to somewhere we werent too interested in (like walmart or target), our parents would \"buy\" the gift card off of us since they would use it towards groceries, etc. Mac books are expensive, so it will take a while, but that way she can decide if she really wants one.", "NTA. I\u2019m 15, and an owner of a MacBook Air myself. My parents bought it for me after my cheap old school laptop decided to stop working. I offered to pay for majority as I do have a job through the week but they said they\u2019d pay the whole thing as I needed it for school. I am extremely lucky that my parents could and were willing to afford it, but If it wasn\u2019t used for school then I don\u2019t see why you should buy such an expensive laptop, especially for your kid who isn\u2019t in high school just yet.", "Obviously NTA. I was over 40 when I first got a MacBook Pro. \n\nAt 11, your daughter can do some light jobs - to earn her way to the \u2018trophy\u2019 laptop. Maybe next Christmas a mini iPad. Very few young children actually **need** a professional laptop. She simply wants a Mac Bragbook.  Stand firm, Dad. You\u2019re absolutely correct.", "NTA. It's not expected to get a child an adult's tool, that comes at an adult price. If you have reservations about the ability for your 11yo to be responsible with expensive kit, then trust your instincts. If it's about money, trust your instincts. My parents borrowed money to purchase my first computer that got me on the path of tech and cybersec when no-one had a computer at home. It was  $5,273.78 in today's money and I was 15. I eventually paid them back but not in today's money.", "NTA - don't feed into the apple shame that people try to force on others.\n\nAlso I know school has changed alot since I was there, but I can't possibly see how a 12 year old needs a lap top for school", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe 11 year old needs to learn that she won't get something just because other have it. She has a computers at her disposal to use and it would be unfair to other if she'd get 1200$ macbook.  \n\n\nYou can give a way to earn at least part of the money for macbook in terms of giving her money if she helps out with chores. That way she can get macbook although much later and it teaches her importance of saving and being smart with her money.", "NTA oldest bought it from her own money so the youngest should do the same. Tell her you cannot always get what you want. You need to work hard for it.", "NTA\n\nEven if you're swimming in money, she doesn't need it.", "NTA.  If her friends make fun of her over something like that, they're not worth having as friends in the first place.  Better she find that out now than later.", "She's 11. She doesn't need a new MacBook or whatever electronic device is in now just because everyone has one. Your oldest has one because she bought it, and in high school, she needs more advanced devices for her school work and assignments. she'll be fine with what she has. don't let your wife bully you into buying one. nta", "Nope, NTA. \n\nI would not buy a Mac anything for a 12 year old. The don\u2019t understand the concept of the value of an item like that and the consequences of what dropping a MacBook whatever on the concrete would mean to them. \n\nI work in IT, every week an ADULT drops a $1000+ company laptop and breaks it. We then have to prepare a replacement and transfer their data to the new computer and arrange for the repair of the damaged one. I\u2019ve worked in IT for 11 years, it\u2019s job security, but it does get old.\n\nMy youngest, (at 12!) dropped her first cellphone in a river and was in inconsolable for days afterwards. I was able to getting it working after a battery replacement. But we made her wait because we\u2019d told her to leave it in the car.\n\nIf your wife disagrees, tell your wife she can pay for it and then stand back and wait because you already know what will happen.", "I am a P.C. guy so I am biased . Anything Apple sells is overpriced and unless you are doing video editing , it\u2019s not worth it . Even with video editing , you can find a P.C. that can do the same or beat it .", "As the oldest child I resented working for all I had like my cell phone (even paid my own bill) while my brothers had all of it handed to them and paid for at a younger age without working for it. Unless it\u2019s something that is absolutely needed then absolutely NTA. \n\nAnything a child works for and earns should not be a factor in making a decision for another sibling. \n\nMy oldest got a phone last year at 12 earlier than I had anticipated because of what she was going through at her other parent\u2019s house. I wanted to give her access to call for an emergency whether it was me or someone else. My middle child asks when she can have a phone. I\u2019ve decided 12 as well as I want to be fair across the board.", "Lmao fuck no. Unless ur kid is like genius level. Do not buy them a macbook just because.", "NTA.  But not very imaginative.  Put her to work doing chores with no fixed payment schedule, but that she knows there is one.  When she reaches the point where she understands the value of productive work, she gets the macbook.  If you tell her the goal she will tell you everyday that she has learned.  You will have to be artful, encouraging, informative, not critical for this to work.  You can do it, dad.", "NTA. She doesn't need it, she wants it and we all know why a kid wants a mac book.", "NAH - honestly, I spent a lot of money (my own, saved slowly) on Apple products as a pre-teen and I got wayyy more out of the experience then than I do now. It\u2019s not wrong to want something purely for the aesthetic and it\u2019s fine to want something pretty of your own, even if it\u2019s a bit frivolous. I was completely hooked on upgrading to the latest and greatest every year when I was 12; today I use the iPhone 8 and a 2009 MacBook. If she\u2019s been good all year and you can afford it I don\u2019t see why not!", "Massive yes to being an asshole. You should buy a child a mac book when they are born.", "NTA\n\nStop your children from making Apple or whatever their identity.\n\nTeach your kid to build a personality so she doesn't need to use useless electronics to validate her existence.\n\nI feel like this is one of those moments that will greatly impact how she is in the future with her personality\n\nWhat do I know though, I'm on reddit \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really needed as much as wanted.\n\nBUT, if you both were willing to compromise a little, could you look for a used and slightly older version? It would be far cheaper, she\u2019d still have a MacBook, just not the latest and greatest.\n\nIf that compromise is not good for her, then it\u2019s just because she wants the shiny new thing. If it\u2019s really about having a better tool at her disposal, then second hand will give her that. Just be sure to get something that\u2019s just new enough not to need replacing too soon.", "So do 11 year olds hang out and have laptop parties?  Does she say,\u201dI\u2019m going to Becky\u201ds house to study\u201d with her Chromebook in her backpack? If the answer is no, I\u2019m thinking BS.  \n\nThe only way I could justify the purchase is if it\u2019s required for school, but that would\u2019ve come up in September.  Stand your ground", "NTA. I supervise several IT engineers across 15 school districts. My first question when talking about this would be, what does the school recommend? If the school recommends a chromebook or issues Chromebooks to the students, that\u2019s what you get her. If they insist on a MacBook Air, then you get her one of those. Windows? That\u2019s fine, too.\n\nThe problem with getting a middle school student any device is that it *will* get broken. And a MacBook is an expensive device to have to replace. Any damage to an out of coverage MacBook Air costs $500 to fix. Two problems at the same time and you\u2019re paying for a new one. So if you did choose to buy one you need Apple Care on the device, and even then you have deductibles.\n\nSo if the school recommends a chromebook, then there\u2019s no reason to go any further than that right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It took him 4 months to raise his half but he was beaming with pride and joy when he made that trip to Apple.", "Chromebooks suck, when I was in school and had to use them they were annoyingly slow and never worked how I wanted them to. Perhaps instead though I know it\u2019s pretty late in the game, a cheaper but decent laptop from dell or Lenovo would do? It\u2019s a better laptop but it\u2019s not MacBook levels", "NTA.  Though I will say you could find a model a few years older, refurbished for half the cost.", "I don't understand your wife's logic. Of course a 17 year old can get a job and an 11 year old can't.  Did the 17 year old have a job at 11?  It's like comparing apples and oranges.", "I bought one for my 8 year old from Costco instead of having a birthday party for her. They\u2019re on sale.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour 11 year old is just being 11. They'll always want to fit in, and there will always be *something* they insist they need.\n\nPlus there's definitely nothing an 11 year old can do with a computer that would require a MacBook", "NTA\n\nshe already has her own Chromebook so why does she need a MacBook? shes my age too and I get how nice MacBooks r but if you can't afford it, don't buy it lol.", "NTA. an 11/12 year old child does not need a macbook. she especially shouldnt be given a macbook just because her friends have one. your wife is wrong for wanting to get her one just because she wants one, not because shes old enough to actually have a use for it. plus, kids break things.", "NTA.\n\nLook, I get it that as a kid you worry a lot about what others will think of you, but I'm gonna be real, the only people that do are assholes you don't wanna hang out with anyway. One of the most popular kids in my grade didn't have his own phone until he was 17. It made no difference tbh. He was still involved in everything. He had a home laptop he could message us from to arrange hanging out and his parents gave him privacy on it. We saw him at school every day so he was still involved in our in jokes. It really made no difference. And his example is an extreme one.\n\nYour daughter doesn't need a macbook. Nobody good will care about it. Your daughter will be upset, but that's fine. It won't kill her to be a bit upset. If she wants one she can wait until she has a job and get it herself. Also I'm gonna be real, a macbook is shit. Don't spend that much money on something like that.", "If you do get it, I\u2019d go the refurbished route and get one on backstreet or similar", "Hey Man! You're NTA but if you'd like to clear it off your chest buy her a used MacBook! Maybe 2017+ would be a better option so you don't have the massive bezels", "NTA. Your daughter wants a MacBook because it's a status symbol. That's why she thinks she has a \"slow chromebook\". It's because her friends whose parents buy them apple stuff make fun of her for having a chromebook. Guaranteed.", "Your 11 year old needs new friends. I can\u2019t even justify the cost of a MacBook. Your daughter needs to wait until she\u2019s old enough to get a job and then decide if a laptop is worth spending her hard earned money on. You would also be unfair to your older kid by just giving an 11 year old a piece of technology they don\u2019t need, when the elder one worked and paid for theirs.  NTA", "How manipulative. Giving in to this would be a bad idea, she clearly doesn't need it, and it would teach her older sister that you don't value her hard work", "NTA. \"But the child wants it!\" isn't a sound reasoning for...anything. \n\nBut perhaps there's an opportunity here where your 11 year-old can be provided with opportunities to earn extra money from you by doing chores. It will take her a while to earn enough to cover it, which will help her understand the cost of a Macbook and the value of money.", "NTA. She will have a very unhappy life comparing herself to others.", "NTA unless she's honestly looking to start down a path of making iphone apps. Then a discussion is to be had.", "NTA, I got a fancy MacBook Pro for my high school graduation gift courtesy of my parents. Even upgraded galore since I was taking graphic design classes in college my freshman year and needed the extra stuff. We used Chromebooks back in high school, they were fine.\n\nI will say, MacBooks are WAY better longevity wise than a Windows. I had a Windows Lenovo ThinkPad at work and it died after 5 years. My 2014 MacBook Pro on the other hand was still kicking in 2023.\n\nI bought myself an M2 Air when they came out with upgrades to replace my 2014 Pro.", "When your 11 year says their friends will make fun of them, one, it's probably not true, or two, they're talking about one or two people.  It's certainly not fair that the 17 year old bought their own, and actually has a need for it, while your 11 year only needs to ask.", "Dropping and breaking is the very important factor, when parens are considering buying some to their children.   \nMy daughter's school provides the studens sturdy chromebooks - designed to endure 1,5 m fall.   \nIt happened.   \nChromebook survived ;).", "Nowdays even 1st graders use them in school.   \nMy daughter's school provides all the students chromebooks.   \nIt's enough for the schoolwork.", "lol same", "Apple for new MacBooks has the subscription based AppleCare+ that never expires unless you don\u2019t renew at the end of the year (whenever that is based off purchase date). That\u2019s what I have for my M2 Air, it just auto charges my credit card every year for the renewal. \n\nSo, if it\u2019s broke, you just pay the deductible for eternity so long as you renew.", "Asus chromebook user here ;)   \nAfter a few Windows laptops, I decided to buy this chromebook - it's enough for mine needs and purposes.   \nI'm not gaming (not those demanding games anyway),  I don't do any proffesional work on my chromebook - I use it privately for social media, communication, shopping etc - like any average middle-aged people.   \nStreaming is brilliant.", "That is complete BS. Unlike a Mac , you can upgrade your pc to do anything you want", "Not all are equal. My son has one from his school in the past and it was garbage. It broke. The replacement was vastly better. I them bought one for him and the difference was night and day between a generation.\n\nStill, it's absolute trash compared to the weakest mac's out this year.\n\nTruly it depends on what you're doing. Going to start coding in Jr high? Mac is it. You cannot easily code xCode/swift on anything else.", "I take issue with \"expensive\" in this case.\n\nI used to by my wife a new Windows laptop every other year if consumer grade, I might get 3-4 years if business grade.  She does a ton of work on it, so would literally wear through the keyboards, things like that.\n\nThen about 12 years ago, I bought her a Macbook for like 1200 bucks.  Large one time expense?  Yup.  About double what I was buying her Windows laptops for.  Worth every penny?  OMG yes, it lasted 11 years, and finally replaced it like 6 months ago finally.  \n\nMacbooks are built better, flat out.  Mac OSX is a better design for long term use.  You don't get into the whole \"Wipe and reinstall\" every year or so to keep it running well.", "Ditto except the notes thing. They didn't trust us to not play video games while they taught so laptops were closed for the first part of class, then while we worked on assignments they could be open.", "Why not just use paper for most things. I understand it's good to get kids to use computers a bit but it shouldn't be most classes.", "What's easier to keeo track of? Paper or electronic files? Each saved file is put on a server, the teachers have access, the students have access, and potentially parents. Teachers can send assignments to sick kids who cant make classes, students can share notes, ect.\n\nAlso, in theory less environmental impact."]}
