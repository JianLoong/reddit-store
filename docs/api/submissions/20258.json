I think finding the balance between normalizing certain topics and watching what you say in front of your children is hard, especially since kids are also constantly word vomiting w/o any filter. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n\nNext time, instead of blaming your wife, you could be more supportive and instead of saying it\u2019s her fault, maybe say something like, \u201cWhat do you think we could\u2019ve done better?\u201d That way you\u2019re working with her as a partner instead of full out blaming her. \n\nMaybe you could also work with your daughter on especially not repeating things that could potentially be hurtful to another person?", "NTA. These things happen. I was mortified when I took my 6 year old son to a walk-in place in the mall for a haircut. He sits down in the chair, smiles at the stylist and said 'this place isn't as good as the salon you go to where they give you drinks, is it Mom?' I apologized to the stylist. I had pretty much told him that when he asked why I go to the salon instead of the walk-in place. The way to handle it is to talk about what kinds of things are ok to repeat and to whom. You have to actively teach children this. Censoring has its place but you can use these incidents to talk about why we don't repeat certain things, how to be sensitive to other people's feelings, etc", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife was ok with being more open and honest in front of Ashley *until* she got called out. Hypocrisy at its finest.", "NTA, so she expects more from your 7 year old than she expects of herself? It\u2019s a 7 year old. They\u2019re gonna repeat things.", "You are NTA here but your wife is wrong. Kids are going to repeat things. They don't know yet what is appropriate and what isn't and you can't possibly cover every situation with them. So if you don't want them to repeat it, don't say it in front of them. \n\nThat being said, telling the babysitter that she is too expensive isn't the worst blooper she could make. Talk to any kindergarten teacher about some of the funny things their kids have said. Teachers of young children hear it all!", "NTA lol your wife is delusional", "Nta.\n\nYour wife must not remember what being a kid is like.  \nYour daughter is 7. They don't understand the concept of adult discretion. Your wife expecting your daughter to somehow innately understand what she can repeat and what she can't is hilarious, considering for basically all of human history adults have known to moderate what they say around children of that age.\n\nGotta be one of the oldest tropes in existence, tbh.", "NTA. If it\u2019s something embarrassing enough not to want it repeated, it shouldn\u2019t be said in front of a small child. They are parrots, and they do not know any better. They won\u2019t understand why you can say some things and not others. I bet your wife will be more careful now.", "It's hilarious that the mother is unhappy about lack of discretion by her daughter, when the root cause is her own inability to be discreet. If Mom is careful about what she says, daughter has nothing to repeat.", "Sounds like a perfect illustration of the old adage \"Little pitchers have big ears.\"", "i learned this the hard way\u2026i was talking to my dad and  said \u201cshe was dragged by her hair\u201d and a child popped up like quite literally popped up: \u201cSHE WAS DRAGGED BY HER HAIR??\u201d", "Wife was the one who got dramatic about the comment being made public, not the OP.", "Nah, he also scolded his wife for saying it in front of the kid in the first place.", "After wife complained about kid repeating her words.

Telling someone in private \"I don't think it was appropriate\" is not dramatic.", "It is when it was a totally normal, appropriate thing to say. Which is why I think they are both making too much of a simple statement.", "Not talking about worker being too expensive is a common cultural expectation. It may be silly, but it is society as a whole that deserves blame in that case, not indovidual OP."]}
