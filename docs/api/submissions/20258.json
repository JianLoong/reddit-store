I think finding the balance between normalizing certain topics and watching what you say in front of your children is hard, especially since kids are also constantly word vomiting w/o any filter. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n\nNext time, instead of blaming your wife, you could be more supportive and instead of saying it\u2019s her fault, maybe say something like, \u201cWhat do you think we could\u2019ve done better?\u201d That way you\u2019re working with her as a partner instead of full out blaming her. \n\nMaybe you could also work with your daughter on especially not repeating things that could potentially be hurtful to another person?", "NTA. These things happen. I was mortified when I took my 6 year old son to a walk-in place in the mall for a haircut. He sits down in the chair, smiles at the stylist and said 'this place isn't as good as the salon you go to where they give you drinks, is it Mom?' I apologized to the stylist. I had pretty much told him that when he asked why I go to the salon instead of the walk-in place. The way to handle it is to talk about what kinds of things are ok to repeat and to whom. You have to actively teach children this. Censoring has its place but you can use these incidents to talk about why we don't repeat certain things, how to be sensitive to other people's feelings, etc", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife was ok with being more open and honest in front of Ashley *until* she got called out. Hypocrisy at its finest.", "NTA, so she expects more from your 7 year old than she expects of herself? It\u2019s a 7 year old. They\u2019re gonna repeat things.", "You are NTA here but your wife is wrong. Kids are going to repeat things. They don't know yet what is appropriate and what isn't and you can't possibly cover every situation with them. So if you don't want them to repeat it, don't say it in front of them. \n\nThat being said, telling the babysitter that she is too expensive isn't the worst blooper she could make. Talk to any kindergarten teacher about some of the funny things their kids have said. Teachers of young children hear it all!", "NTA lol your wife is delusional", "Nta.\n\nYour wife must not remember what being a kid is like.  \nYour daughter is 7. They don't understand the concept of adult discretion. Your wife expecting your daughter to somehow innately understand what she can repeat and what she can't is hilarious, considering for basically all of human history adults have known to moderate what they say around children of that age.\n\nGotta be one of the oldest tropes in existence, tbh.", "NTA. If it\u2019s something embarrassing enough not to want it repeated, it shouldn\u2019t be said in front of a small child. They are parrots, and they do not know any better.

I bet your wife will be more careful now.", "It's hilarious that the mother is unhappy about lack of discretion by her daughter, when the root cause is her own inability to be discreet.

Thalia sets her own rates, she can take the feedback or not. Normalizing budget discussions with your kid is good, and I see no reason why you should worry that Thalia would be offended about it.", "NTA.  It absolutely is all your wifes fault.

That reminds me of a commercial for granola bars about 10-15 years ago, where the kids were either repeating what they heard or spilling gossip that they weren't supposed to- \"Mom is a LOT older than she tells people\" ,\"Dad lost a bunch of money at the casino\", etc but my favorite was when the kid was telling the bride at a wedding \"My mom said she couldn't believe that you'd wear white!\" \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "NTA at all, kids repeat shit they hear all the time.", "I don\u2019t know if she was offended and I\u2019m certainly not worried if she is.

Me as a bright kid goes up to her and calls her one. \n\nDad learned then not to say that around any of us kids.", "Wife is the AH for ranting about the kid not having a filter when she is partially to blame for that", "I was about to say, gee you say absolutely ANYTHING in front of your kid but don't think THEY would do the exact same thing? The lack of self awareness this woman has is actually funny. NTA however, you CAN help the situation by sitting your daughter down...WHEN YOUR WIFE ISNT AROUND...and tell her to not repeat anything mommy talks about. Tell her some things are for family ears only. Yes OP is correct his wife should practice discretion but if she isnt, he can at least get the daughter to have some.", "NTA number 1 rule of parenting is not to say something around your kids you don\u2019t want repeated. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a kid to an age where you can tell them not to repeat what you say and your daughter is about that age BUT you have to be super specific to them about NOT repeating certain things. Even then there\u2019s no guarantee. While I understand your wife\u2019s thinking she does have to remember that kids are kids and are innocent so a little censorship goes a long way. On top of that it\u2019s never good to talk about others around kids. It only teaches them to talk about other as well.", "NTA, kids are sponges without filters, so everything they hear can be wrung out.\n\nKids don't need to hear everything!", "Mom got exactly what she modelled", "I wish I had an award to give\ud83c\udf96\ud83c\udf96\ud83c\udf96", "Even though Thalia said, \"it's fine\" (which often means it *isn't* fine), it might not hurt to clarify that you absolutely think she's worth her price (assuming that's true), it's just not one you can currently afford.
