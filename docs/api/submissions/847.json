A few weeks ago a friend (27?F) reached out asking about a commission for her new home. It\u2019s a digital piece that she can then print out and frame as she sees fit.\n\nI was happy to oblige, so we talked a bit about her vision & scope & budget. Right off the bat, she mentioned starting a little passion project together that involves selling a bunch of variations of the print I was going to make for her (thru a popular online art marketplace). Honestly, I\u2019m a people pleaser, so I tried to kinda skirt around the idea for a while, offering noncommittal responses like \u201caw, fun idea, but I don\u2019t think I can handle it right now\u201d and trying to instead refocus on the commission she\u2019d asked me for.\n\nWe\u2019re trucking along on the commission now, and she\u2019s mentioned this store idea a lot. At a certain point I did kind of want to know what exactly she had in mind as far as division of labor and profit %s go. The other night she sent me a detailed list of the digital print variations she\u2019d like me to make, along with a proposed flat price for all 24 of them (the price she offered wasn\u2019t great for the amount of product, but she did mention her flexibility there - e.g. taking some variations off the lineup to be able to pay me fairly). Her idea was to then sell these online. She didn\u2019t mention me getting profits.\n\nHere\u2019s where I could be in the wrong - I may have led her on a bit by asking some follow-up questions to this list, like \u201care you open to doing all printing/framing/shipping/customer relations and then splitting profits with me since I\u2019d be making them? Do you want to sell these as PDFs?\u201d etc. But the more I thought about it, the more I wasn\u2019t feeling good about the whole thing. Especially since I looked into it and you can have products printed on demand / drop-shipped with zero manual labor on the seller\u2019s part. I started thinking - if I wanted to sell my art, I wouldn\u2019t need someone else to help me do that. And I don\u2019t want someone else \u201cowning\u201d my work.\n\nWithout waiting for her response, I sent her a long and very nice text explaining all this gently, thanked her for thinking of me, and apologized for backing out. This was yesterday midday and she\u2019s gone radio silent, no response. I\u2019m worried I really pissed her off here.\n\nI know she was super jazzed about this idea, but I really don\u2019t want to have someone open a store to sell my original prints and not be the one 100% profiting from it all, especially if they aren\u2019t putting any labor into the process. We didn\u2019t have any written agreement or anything, but I feel like a butt hole for not communicating clearly enough earlier on. AITA?\n\n\n~UPDATE~\n\nHer boyfriend reached out to mine (they\u2019re brothers) asking if I was aware of the benefits of this proposed deal and wondering why in the world I\u2019m not all-in on it. Which truly is further confirmation for me to stay out of this whole situation. Bf is relaying what I\u2019ve already said.\n\nAt this point I\u2019d like to thank you all for your considerate input, and I plan to stand solidly in my stance - hard pass :-)", "created_utc": 1667352319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjrld3/aita_for_shutting_down_a_friends_attempt_to_make/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
