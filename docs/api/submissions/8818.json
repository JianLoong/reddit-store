My partner is on the spectrum and can sometimes not realise how hurtful some things he does are until its pointed out. We had agreed that my first tattoo and his 3rd tattoo (he had 2 at the time) would be together. We'd talked about it for 2 years and he'd always said about the expense and him not knowing what he wanted etc. Que the end of December last year and he off hand mentions that he and 2 of his mates had planned to get tattoos and picked them out and everything from 2 weeks back. This was 2 days before the set date he was now telling me. I was naturally very hurt as it came across as a deliberate snub or like I was a lower priority. I voiced to him that I was not going to stop him or hold it against him, but that it had hurt me because of those reasons. His eyes went wide as he realised how it came across and within the hour he had called the friends to tell them he wanted me to join and he paid for my tattoo and helped me pick out a design and all.

I would venture a guess that this is because going to Europe isn't something that a majority of Americans do and we recognize that travel within europe is much more flexible than in the US. \n\nOnly 1/3 of our citizens have valid passports. \"Planning\" a trip to Europe is in essence a way of saying to a potential travel partner \"hey there are several places in Europe that sound amazing, let's talk.\" and details of locations can get hammered down from this originalidea of \"a trip to europe\". This is more applicable as a more comprehensive trip as Europe is much more easily accessible by rail and other modes of transportation as opposed to the US. So adding multiple destinations that different travel partners would want to see is more viable. For instance, two populous cities in Europe that are relatively far apart when you consider the size of the continent would be rather accessible without a car or plane. Instead you would travel via rail and it will likely be economical and have major city destinations one could visit more easily along the route. In the US we simply dont have that. If you want to go to a destination city in the US you usually are going to that destination and that's it. If I'm going from Chicago to Vegas, first of all I'm sure as hell NOT taking a train as it's gonna be like $300 and take 3 days. And if I did take a train there simply isn't much else to see on the theoretical route aside from maybe some cool countryside views you could see from the train itself. \n\nWithin the US the only place you would conceivably travel to and have multiple destinations in a manner as simple as Europe would be the east coast. A lot of people take trips to New York City that then extend into other easily accessible rail or bus destinations like Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, etc. Those would probably be the 4 major cities you'd conceivably be able to easily see by rail or bus. Other than that the option just isn't there. \n\nTo paint you a picture of how absolutely garbage our rail system is outside of the major metropolitan east coast. I live in the SF bay area, San Francisco is a major American city. Los Angeles is our next closest major American city outside of the immediate bay area. We have literally 0 direct train line option from the city of San Francisco to the city of Los Angeles. If you want to take a \"direct\" train, you actually have to start in Emeryville. Well, \"where the fuck is Emeryville?\" You ask? It's simply all the way across the san francisco bay and the train station in Emeryville that will take you to Los Angeles is not near any of our other major transit systems or anything else really. So enjoy getting to that train station. Also the train from that station to LA doesn't even take you TO Los Angeles. It takes you to Bakersfield where you then have to transfer to a bus for the last 100 miles of the journey. All of this takes a total of 9 hours. So getting there is a nightmare. \n\nIn contrast I had a 10 day business trip within Europe not too long ago and we had stops in Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Koln, and Brussels. There was a major train station in the middle of each of these cities and we walked to them from our hotel. I agree it's definitely not a comprehensive all encompassing view of Europe,  but that's 4 pretty big cities that are all drastically different than any part of the USA. Sure there is no way we saw most of what someone could in a 5 or 6 day trip to each of those cities but there is a lot to experience in 10 days \"in europe\" seeing those 4 places than I'd get within most US trips. So a Europe trip in any general sense for an American is a wildly different experience.", "This is who you want to have a joint bank account with?", "Is it possible that one of his friends offered to pay at least a portion of it? \nIt doesn't change the fact that you're NTA though.", "Ding ding ding.

I don't like to jump on the \"get rid of him\" bandwagon straight away but really, he's shown you that something that is \"impossible\" with you is easily achievable with his friends. His friends come before you now and this will never change.

He \\***feels**\\* emotionally manipulated by it, but for kids this age a feeling is an action you know? Was the same for me at this age.

Could be the cost of a bunch of them splitting it is less, could be he wanted to save the money but all his friends were doing it so he's going to do whatever it takes because it is his only chance to do this with his buds, who knows. They need to have an open and honest talk using the best language and reiterating what they are hearing from the other.", "Yeh tbh how he\u2019s communicating is way more of a flag to me than the actual trip.

Wether the bf shut it down intentionally or subconsciously (like if he couldn\u2019t handle disappointing op and he was just avoiding responsibility as a learned response) it\u2019s still manipulative. 25 is old enough to learn how to acknowledge their partners feelings without being dismissive. it\u2019s not ops job to be hurt in order for the bf to learn how to communicate", "Right but to be fair a group trip staying in hostels and stuff is not the same as a couples trip. Did you want to do a hostel type trip? If you plan one with another couple he might well do it in a few months.\n\nI think people are getting at the cost difference. A trip for one person to Europe and a trip for two people to europe split two ways are very different. Split 4 or 6 or 8 ways versus 2... drastically different. And if you wouldn't want to stay in the same conditions (and to be honest sometimes as a female I consider safety as well of certain things) the prices may just vary. Plus it doesn't sound like he organized it. If your girlfriends were doing a a cheap group europe trip, wouldn't you find a way to afford it, even if previously you would have told your bf you should wait as you didn't have the money? A.) it's way cheaper and B.) a bunch of other people will not wait. You find a way now or you never get that trip.\n\nI don't think it means anything about his feelings toward you necessarily, idk. I do think you two should have an open and honest convo.\n\nWould it be crazy if you mentioned the possibility of would he be interested in joining for part of it? Do NOT push this, as you know. But he might actually be really into that. If he isn't, it doesn't mean anything but the guys would not like it.\n\nWhy not talk and make a real plan for a europe trip next year? He can ask around about good european hostels in different cities and which cities are the most fun and safe!\n\nBut you two definitely need to talk.

If you can't handle hearing your partner's feelings about a decision then you shouldn't be in a relationship. It is really not a punitive measure at all.

I mean why did you immediately jump to emotionally controlling? Any therapist will tell you that healthy communication is \"I\" statements and having open communication about feelings even ones that seem \"negative\" at first because you can't address them and deal with them if you never say them. \"I feel really disappointed with this. Can we talk about it?\" I think the fact that you jumped to emotionally controlling right away for expressing feelings in a healthy way speaks more about you and your experiences than anything else but ya know you do you and hold it all in I guess.", "I think they would just go on their boys' trip without OP's boyfriend.", "right on point. the problem isn\u2019t that op was sad. the problem is that is seen as a bad thing. even if it temporarily made the bf less excited about their trip, guilt/remorse for not considering op isn\u2019t inherently negative either. feeling shitty about that for two seconds and learning how to cope with it is a lot better than just saying \u201cnah i didn\u2019t do anything wrong you\u2019re just trying to control me\u201d that attitude will affect the relationship and the bfs life in general if that\u2019s how he handles problems"]}
