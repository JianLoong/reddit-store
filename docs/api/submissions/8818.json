My partner is on the spectrum and can sometimes not realise how hurtful some things he does are until its pointed out. We had agreed that my first tattoo and his 3rd tattoo (he had 2 at the time) would be together. We'd talked about it for 2 years and he'd always said about the expense and him not knowing what he wanted etc. Que the end of December last year and he off hand mentions that he and 2 of his mates had planned to get tattoos and picked them out and everything from 2 weeks back. This was 2 days before the set date he was now telling me. I was naturally very hurt as it came across as a deliberate snub or like I was a lower priority. I voiced to him that I was not going to stop him or hold it against him, but that it had hurt me because of those reasons. His eyes went wide as he realised how it came across and within the hour he had called the friends to tell them he wanted me to join and he paid for my tattoo and helped me pick out a design and all.

I would venture a guess that this is because going to Europe isn't something that a majority of Americans do and we recognize that travel within europe is much more flexible than in the US. \n\nOnly 1/3 of our citizens have valid passports. \"Planning\" a trip to Europe is in essence a way of saying to a potential travel partner \"hey there are several places in Europe that sound amazing, let's talk.\" and details of locations can get hammered down from this originalidea of \"a trip to europe\". This is more applicable as a more comprehensive trip as Europe is much more easily accessible by rail and other modes of transportation as opposed to the US. So adding multiple destinations that different travel partners would want to see is more viable. For instance, two populous cities in Europe that are relatively far apart when you consider the size of the continent would be rather accessible without a car or plane. Instead you would travel via rail and it will likely be economical and have major city destinations one could visit more easily along the route. In the US we simply dont have that. If you want to go to a destination city in the US you usually are going to that destination and that's it. If I'm going from Chicago to Vegas, first of all I'm sure as hell NOT taking a train as it's gonna be like $300 and take 3 days. And if I did take a train there simply isn't much else to see on the theoretical route aside from maybe some cool countryside views you could see from the train itself. \n\nWithin the US the only place you would conceivably travel to and have multiple destinations in a manner as simple as Europe would be the east coast. A lot of people take trips to New York City that then extend into other easily accessible rail or bus destinations like Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, etc. Those would probably be the 4 major cities you'd conceivably be able to easily see by rail or bus. Other than that the option just isn't there. \n\nTo paint you a picture of how absolutely garbage our rail system is outside of the major metropolitan east coast. I live in the SF bay area, San Francisco is a major American city. Los Angeles is our next closest major American city outside of the immediate bay area. We have literally 0 direct train line option from the city of San Francisco to the city of Los Angeles. If you want to take a \"direct\" train, you actually have to start in Emeryville. Well, \"where the fuck is Emeryville?\" You ask? It's simply all the way across the san francisco bay and the train station in Emeryville that will take you to Los Angeles is not near any of our other major transit systems or anything else really. So enjoy getting to that train station. Also the train from that station to LA doesn't even take you TO Los Angeles. It takes you to Bakersfield where you then have to transfer to a bus for the last 100 miles of the journey. All of this takes a total of 9 hours. So getting there is a nightmare. \n\nIn contrast I had a 10 day business trip within Europe not too long ago and we had stops in Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Koln, and Brussels. There was a major train station in the middle of each of these cities and we walked to them from our hotel. I agree it's definitely not a comprehensive all encompassing view of Europe,  but that's 4 pretty big cities that are all drastically different than any part of the USA. Sure there is no way we saw most of what someone could in a 5 or 6 day trip to each of those cities but there is a lot to experience in 10 days \"in europe\" seeing those 4 places than I'd get within most US trips. So a Europe trip in any general sense for an American is a wildly different experience.", "This is who you want to have a joint bank account with?", "Is it possible that one of his friends offered to pay at least a portion of it? \nIt doesn't change the fact that you're NTA though.", "Ding ding ding.

I can also understand BF wanting to go on the guys trip- a guys trip to Europe is likely a once in a lifetime chance and something he doesn\u2019t want to feel left out of whereas If he sees a future with you then there are lots of chances for you two to travel together. It sounds like you two need to have another adult discussion where you both work on understanding each other\u2019s perspectives. I would be careful with the joint bank account though. Please don\u2019t let his spending problems become yours.", "NTA. I don't understand how he thinks you wouldn't be hurt by this.", "NTA!!\n\nDo you currently have a joint account? If yes, I'd suggest A) Dumping his sorry butt (after he departs) and B) remove your funds and start new elsewhere. Especially, as you say, he is spending funds he does not have - which, in turn, might mean he's expecting YOU to pay for his \"Trip of a lifetime\"....", "NTA pull all of your money out of that joint account and plan a girls trip", "Tell him he should go but while hes there figure out what are the odds of you still being there when he gets back. NTA", "NTA girl you already know exactly what i\u2019m gonna say. LEAVE HIM.", "NTA.\n\ni\u2019m going to the planetarium with a friend this weekend and before I booked any tickets I asked my fianc\u00e9 which show he wants to see (i knew he mentioned one) & then made sure to book any other show than the one he mentioned. he wants us to go together & i respect that. this is a wayyyy smaller instance & i\u2019d understand my fianc\u00e9 being upset if i saw the show he wants to see with me. this is way bigger than that.", "NTA. You were toeing the line a little bit but that you didn't even ask him not to go? you're totally NTA here, you were just sharing how it made you feel and he went on the attack. Dump him while he's on the trip.", "He\u2019s letting you know his priorities. Friends are more important to him than the plans you\u2019ve made. However you guys are 25, so I may not take it as personally as you guys are still young, and figuring life out.", "Nta have you seen midsummer? Just a suggestion.", "NTA. But probably a big sign that you both view your relationship differently.  He\u2019s still in a \u201cMe\u201d mindset and you\u2019re in the \u201cUs\u201d mindset.  Don\u2019t think twice about moving on.  You are young! Spend these years with someone who wants \u201cUs.\u201d", "expressing your feelings about a situation is not \"emotionally controlling.\" he's trying to make you feel bad for just saying what's bothering you. he is trying to discredit/devalue you.\n\nHE is emotionally controlling in this case. you are NTA.", "NTA but super weird to describe a one year relationship in terms of \"we always talked about having joint bank accounts\". That's super not normal for a relatively new relationship unless you were specifically discussing getting married.", "NTA. Let him go on his trip, and don\u2019t be there when he gets back. If you do have a joint bank account, I hope you\u2019ve already gotten your money out of it! \n\nYou can definitely do better than a guy who takes a vacation you were planning together with other people. And then, he tries to act like he\u2019s the victim by saying you\u2019re emotionally controlling him? I\u2019m sorry, but he just sounds like a selfish, manipulative creep.", "NTA. This is worth breaking up over if a Europe trip is really something you both have been talking about the whole relationship, especially since he gaslighted you.", "NTA but he is. I don't think I'd stay with someone who makes plans with me then carries them out with his friends instead.", "NTA - There\u2019s a huge red flag parade, open your eyes and leave. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA and please reconsider this guy. In fact, tell him bon voyage and use the time he's away to reset your life.\n\nAn ex did this to me. I literally asked him he would go to Ireland with me on break (he was from there). I had never been. He says no, he had too much to do and we should both get extra work hours. So I didn't go. Lo and behold, weeks later he informs me he's purchased tickets to go back home with his \"mates\" for the break. And that I shouldn't be mad because it's a \"mate trip\" and therefore totally different. Nevermind the fact that we had plans to at least go see some movies together and eat out a bit more while we were both working over the break.", "You are too invested in this guy. You've only been dating a year bit you have \"always\" talked strategies for saving money? He's gone on other trips before? In a year? Maybe take a step back and figure out if you and bf are on the same page in your relationship. NTA, and him telling you you are emotionally controlling is actually him being emotionally controlling.", "NTA. Read the writing on the wall. He is too chicken shit to break up with you so he is giving you reasons for you to break up with him. It sounds like he's going to be gone for a while and could careless about your feelings. I had an ex do this to me but finally after my dumbass kept getting dragged a long he got some chick from his college to call me to say they had slept together just so I would finally break up with him.", "NTA except your heading should read EX boyfriend", "NTA. so he suddenly has money to go on a trip? he is blatantly telling you where you stand with him. i would listen.", "Yes op should make sure her account isn't joint with his because he might take the money \"he doesn't have \" from hers. It could lead to worse", "This. OP, don't open a joint bank account with this guy. Do you have any friends you could take this trip with? I'd take a step back from the relationship, because nothing that you wrote here speaks of a loving partner or a healthy relationship. He doesn't seem to care about taking a trip with you, or your feelings on the manner, then tried to flip it around on you and make YOU the problem.\n\nRUn away.", "I would even say NAH here really...their in a 1 year relationship...sounds like OP is more invested than her boyfriend...take this as a sign and make him your ex....keep saving for your own europe adventure", "People in this comment section is showing an increadible controlling and mistrusting toxic attitude towards their partners indeed: everything else gets brutally downvoted. It reminds me of that subs for toxic dating advices for girls\u2026", "So all these points are pretty accurate. I'd say ESH with him being the bigger AH. It's one thing to talk about a fictional trip, like I plan trips all the time, but when the elements come together to take the trip, I damn sure jump on it.\n\nHe shouldn't pass this up, a trip with friends sounds great. And a big group going is definitely a different experience to just one or two people going.\n\nBut he was also a bit of a jerk with how he presented it to OP and how he belittled her feelings. It also sounds like he doesn't really have the money to do this trip, so it will affect his ability to go on a trip with OP in the future. OP sounded like they had a longer timeline for their trip, so if he could afford both then yeah go ahead.\n\nOf course this also all hinges on whether or not OP is the type of person to ever actually go on the trip. I know plenty of people that have planned trips like I do. But they don't actually ever go. I'm not holding out on a trip for any of them.", "Also: how realistic is the chance if gf having her 50% share of their couple trip in a short time? We are missing that half of the story. If she\u2019s a student with no income for example, \u201ctalking about planning the trip\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean actually planning it. He might have jumped on the opportunity to travel now instead than only waiting for an hypothetical future. \nAlso: Europe is pretty vague, it is a continent, not a \u201cplace\u201d. You can plan 1000 different trips and never experience the same twice.", "Also: how realistic is the chance if gf having her 50% share of their couple trip in a short time?

Now if she stops him going she is \"emotionally controlling\" him when really he's emotionally controlling her", "The problem here isn\u2019t with him going, the problem is his response. Your feelings are valid and are a very logical way to react to the situation. His response wasn\u2019t to try and make you feel better, it wasn\u2019t to explain why he could afford this trip and not the one with the two of you (ie bigger group makes it cheaper), it wasn\u2019t to propose a solution that would include you or explain how he\u2019s getting ready for your trip, it was to accuse you of being controlling and shut down the conversation. That is manipulative as hell and that\u2019s a BIG red flag.", "Maybe it\u2019s the only chance he\u2019ll have to go to Europe with all his friends together. Trips like those get more complicated as you get older and people have spouses and kids.", "Maybe OP's finances are the reason they decided the trip wasn't financially feasible?", "Yeah, wasn\u2019t super clear if that happened or not.", "Where does it say they have a joint account?", "Gaslighting implies intent. If he thinks OP is manipulating him, and says that, that's not automatically gaslighting. \n\nEven if your explanation is factually true, this is a big reach.", "She's known him a year and is demanding that her desire for a trip to Europe (which he has to pay for) should take precedence over friends he has done much longer.", "Let's not pretend that not wanting your partner on a trip with your friends means you're cheating on them. If everyone else is there alone and you're the only one with a partner it completely changes the dynamic of the trip for you.

He's not going to get any nicer or kinder.", "Cheaper for who? Do they both have money for the cheaper trip or would he be paying for both of them?
