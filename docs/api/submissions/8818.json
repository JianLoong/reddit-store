Him wanting to go on a trip with friends is fine. However, choosing to specifically go on the one trip you had wanted and planned to do together as a couple with his friends instead,  and not asking if maybe you and one or two of your friends would like to join as a way of still keeping the dream.... mega selfish move. \n\nI had a somewhat similar experience when it came to tattoos with my partner. My partner is on the spectrum and can sometimes not realise how hurtful some things he does are until its pointed out. We had agreed that my first tattoo and his 3rd tattoo (he had 2 at the time) would be together. We'd talked about it for 2 years and he'd always said about the expense and him not knowing what he wanted etc. Que the end of December last year and he off hand mentions that he and 2 of his mates had planned to get tattoos and picked them out and everything from 2 weeks back. This was 2 days before the set date he was now telling me. I was naturally very hurt as it came across as a deliberate snub or like I was a lower priority. I voiced to him that I was not going to stop him or hold it against him, but that it had hurt me because of those reasons. His eyes went wide as he realised how it came across and within the hour he had called the friends to tell them he wanted me to join and he paid for my tattoo and helped me pick out a design and all. That's the difference between him being an A like your boyfriend and not. He realised it had hurt me and made an effort to bring the two promises/plans together.

He did not understand why I got upset and even cried over it. In the end, he called the trip off seeing I was upset but he told his friends the only reason he's not going is because of me.

I would venture a guess that this is because going to Europe isn't something that a majority of Americans do and we recognize that travel within europe is much more flexible than in the US. \n\nOnly 1/3 of our citizens have valid passports. \"Planning\" a trip to Europe is in essence a way of saying to a potential travel partner \"hey there are several places in Europe that sound amazing, let's talk.\" This is more applicable as a more comprehensive trip as Europe is much more easily accessible by rail and other modes of transportation as opposed to the US. So adding multiple destinations that different travel partners would want to see is more viable. For instance, two populous cities in Europe that are relatively far apart when you consider the size of the continent would be rather accessible without a car or plane. Instead you would travel via rail and it will likely be economical and have major city destinations one could visit more easily along the route. In the US we simply dont have that. If you want to go to a destination city in the US you usually are going to that destination and that's it. If I'm going from Chicago to Vegas, first of all I'm sure as hell NOT taking a train as it's gonna be like $300 and take 3 days. And if I did take a train there simply isn't much else to see on the theoretical route aside from maybe some cool countryside views you could see from the train itself. \n\nWithin the US the only place you would conceivably travel to and have multiple destinations in a manner as simple as Europe would be the east coast. A lot of people take trips to New York City that then extend into other easily accessible rail or bus destinations like Philadelphia, Washington DC, Boston, etc. Those would probably be the 4 major cities you'd conceivably be able to easily see by rail or bus. Other than that the option just isn't there. \n\nTo paint you a picture of how absolutely garbage our rail system is outside of the major metropolitan east coast. I live in the SF bay area, San Francisco is a major American city. Los Angeles is our next closest major American city. We have literally 0 direct train line option from the city of San Francisco to the city of Los Angeles. If you want to take a \"direct\" train, you actually have to start in Emeryville. Well, \"where the fuck is Emeryville?\" You ask? It's simply all the way across the san francisco bay and the train station in Emeryville that will take you to Los Angeles is not near any of our other major transit systems. Also it doesn't even take you TO Los Angeles. It takes you to Bakersfield where you then have to transfer to a bus for the last 100 miles of the journey. All of this takes a total of 9 hours. So getting there is a nightmare. \n\nIn contrast I had a 10 day business trip within Europe not too long ago and we had stops in Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Koln, and Brussels. There was a major train station in the middle of each of these cities and we walked to them from our hotel. I agree it's definitely not a comprehensive all encompassing view of Europe,  but that's 4 pretty big cities that are all drastically different than any part of the USA. Sure there is no way we saw most of what someone could in a 5 or 6 day trip to each of those cities but there is a lot to experience in 10 days \"in europe\" seeing those 4 places than I'd get within most US trips. So a Europe trip in any general sense for an American is a wildly different experience.", "This is who you want to have a joint bank account with?", "Is it possible that one of his friends offered to pay at least a portion of it? \nIt doesn't change the fact that you're NTA though.", "Ding ding ding.
