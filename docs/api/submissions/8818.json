Let him go and hope he doesn't return. You need a bf who supports you not someone who invalidates you.", "You shared feelings with him and his response was to make you feel even worse for having those feelings. Not a good sign.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What a selfish asshole. I\u2019d dump him. Anyone that goes to Europe with his buds instead of girlfriend will never make you a priority.", "NTA.\n\nIf you have a joint bank account with him, pull out all the money you put in and take your name off of the account.  Do this sooner rather than later.  Then break up with him.\n\nPlan a girls trip with your friends over the summer, it doesn't have to be to Europe.  Have fun and be happy you got away from this dude.", "NTA\n\nHow would he feel if you suddenly had a girls trip planned?\n\nUnless the trip is being funded by someone else, I don't understand how this trip is more of a \"once in a lifetime\" than a trip with you.\n\nI'd move while he was gone.", "NTA. It's clearly not as though you don't want him to go on the trip, it's more so the lack of communication that accompanied it -- and the fact that he's calling you controlling for expressing how you feel certainly isn't a good thing either.", "INFO: is the cost of this friends trip different than the costs of what you were planning together?", "NTA\n\nYour feelings are valid.

This guy is gaslighting you, attempting to shame you out of holding him accountable for what is essentially a massive betrayal. He does not respect you, and I doubt this is the first/last time he will put his needs before yours. Your feelings are so so so valid. If I was in your situation, I would be walking out and then prepping for my dream solo trip.\n\nFor real, go on a solo trip. I took a solo trip after a break up (after begging my bf to travel with me all through our relationship, but never getting him to buy in), and it was one of THE best things I have ever done\n\nIf you want some trip suggestions, I've got a million!!!!", "NTA for sharing your emotion but a group trip and a couple trip are different and the former probably cost a lot less.\n\nAlso, I'm European and may I say I never understood the whole \" let's visit Europe together for the first time.\". Unless you plan to travel through Europe for one whole year, it's impossible to see everything important.\n\nTo make an example: France and Italy are completely different, and, to be even more accurate, Turin, Rome and Genoa, three Italian cities, are completely different from one another and are completely different experiences to visit.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that him going on a trip with his friends to a certain place in Europe doesn't undermine or devalue your future trip together.", "Info:how did going to Europe with his friends come up and get planned and payed for", "NTA how is he paying for this trip when he didnt have enough for yalls couples trip to Europe.

And visa versa, I'd support him if his friends invited him on a group trip and he was able to pinch some pennies and make it happen.\n\nI think it's okay for you to be sad, but it isn't okay for you to hold on to a resentment towards him for taking this opportunity before he was able to plan something with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Him wanting to go on a trip with friends is fine. However, choosing to specifically go on the one trip you had wanted and planned to do together as a couple with his friends instead,  and not asking if maybe you and one or two of your friends would like to join as a way of still keeping the dream.... mega selfish move. \n\nI had a somewhat similar experience when it came to tattoos with my partner. My partner is on the spectrum and can sometimes not realise how hurtful some things he does are until its pointed out. We had agreed that my first tattoo and his 3rd tattoo (he had 2 at the time) would be together. We'd talked about it for 2 years and he'd always said about the expense and him not knowing what he wanted etc. Que the end of December last year and he off hand mentions that he and 2 of his mates had planned to get tattoos and picked them out and everything from 2 weeks back. This was 2 days before the set date he was now telling me. I was naturally very hurt as it came across as a deliberate snub or like I was a lower priority. I voiced to him that I was not going to stop him or hold it against him, but that it had hurt me because of those reasons. His eyes went wide as he realised how it came across and within the hour he had called the friends to tell them he wanted me to join and he paid for my tattoo and helped me pick out a design and all. That's the difference between him being an A like your boyfriend and not. He realised it had hurt me and made an effort to bring the two promises/plans together. By what you've written, your bf hasn't put even a shred of effort into considering it. You're NTA but your bf is.", "NTA. YOURE ALLOWED TO FEEL YOUR FEELINGS.", "NTA. Girl, pull out your share. Leave him when he is in Europe. Block him and go NC. \nIf you stay with him YTA.  It\u2019s sad to see way too many women allow such disrespect from the \u201cfianc\u00e9\u201d.

He wanted to go to Europe. Just not with you. \n\nThat\u2019s some cold and uncaring shit. Add on that he then tries to guilt you by saying your being emotionally controlling. \n\nGet out. Lose his number. He\u2019s bad news.", "I agree with you so much! NTA", "Mine did too!", "Sounds very similar as far as locations, plans while there, etc. so likely a bit cheaper if costs split between the larger group vs between just us two", "That\u2019s a reasonable way to look at it. I think my issue here is if he has cited money as the reason we can\u2019t do our trip together now, it hurts that he can justify that same expense with other people", "He just told me that in their group chat they made this plan a few weeks ago. Not sure how he funded it, likely on credit as he has debt issues as is", "But if he's spending a lot of money going on the trip with his friends, it makes it harder to save for their trip. It would seem like he's putting a trip with his friends before a trip with her. I don't think it's about him going and having a good time with friends, but that if he goes with his friend's it will make it a lot harder to go with her and delay it. It just shows where his priorities are.", "I guess my issue lies in the fact that the reason we haven\u2019t been able to do this trip has been money. This makes me feel like he\u2019s willing to spend the money to go with them, but not with me.", "NTA. If he didn't come to you talking about how this opportunity was considerably cheaper, he just picked  this trip over the trip together and had the nerve to blame you for getting upset.\n\nPull out your part of the funds from the joint account, break up and move on.", "point is it's not the same expense. I don't know how it works in America but in most European countries I know, there is a huge discount for group trip.

His comment was weird though. I'd be disappointed if my partner wasn't happy for me and my opportunity, but I wouldn't call them emotionally controlling. \n\nYou have every right to be disappointed, and your boyfriend has every right to have a blast with the boys. You two will have your time.", "Gentle YTA, you've only been together a year so acting like him going somewhere without you will make it impossible to do a separate trip is pretty hyperbolic. Just start saving now for the future trip and plan to do it when you can both go.", "NTA. You are entitled to your feelings. If you had already started to enact your savings plans I would quickly pull the amount of money you'd put in the joint account otherwise he will likely use it too fund this trip with the explanation that you can always rebuild it afterwards and it will just take longer for the two if you to go. That is something that is NOT an acceptable action. Of course, the likelihood of this type of thing happening again will become far greater as well.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. Solo eurotrips are great! It's much easier to get around.", "Nta. Do yourself a huge favor and run.... far away.", "NTA.  Move on and find a different bf, this guy doesn't care much for you.  Just like he dropped your plans at the first opportunity, he'll do the same when another girl comes along.", "Seriously, for all we know, bf is planning on using her money on the trip\u2026", "He's probably going to cheat on her while he's away too - he doesn't give a shit about her feelings and a boys' trip is the ideal environment for a \"what happens in Vegas\" agreement", "Is it the same expense? Would he be responsible for helping pay for any of your stuff (food, tourist attractions, etc)? Would he get the same discounts? Is he going to the same places? Does he have the money to pay for himself but you don't for yourself?"]}
