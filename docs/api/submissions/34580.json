My parents were married and happy, of course it was so hard for all us.\nIn under a year he met a new woman and then months later announce they\u2019re engaged. It\u2019s a short engagement, about 8-9 months from getting engaged till the actual wedding. I do understand a lot of people (seemingly more widowed men from stories l've others have told me) find someone very quickly and often be remarried before a year even, so l'm trying not to be naive here.\nFor my siblings and l it has been a little strange as for us as we are still processing the death of our mother but also the new fiance is only a few years older than me and my sister who are the eldest. we've tried our best to make an effort to be happy for him and be welcoming to her, all while processing our grief.\nMy issue is that he so wrapped up with his new fianc\u00e9 that he\u2019s forgotten we are still grieving. To the point that on the 2 year anniversary of our mums death 3 of us got their wedding invite in the post while the others the day after. It hurt all of us that they didn\u2019t think about this date in the days/week leading up to it, but I decided to leave it as I didn't want to taint their joy.\nHe sent a message to my grandma (my mums mum) out of the blue after no contact since the funeral (I was with my grandma at the time) asking for their address so he could send them an invite the day after the anniversary, hence we were with my grandparents to support each other.\nNot asking how they were at this time/how they were coping with loss of their daughter/whether they\u2019d be ok with an invite... just stating they were being invited and he needed their address. My dear grandma said she\u2019d like to attend for our sake, though my grandad refused point blank and was too upset to talk further.\nA month later me and my sisters were added to the hen do WhatsApp group with all new fianc\u00e9s friends all now chatting excitedly and planning the hen.\nFor us that was another pang of heartache, as we are only in this position coz our mum (pretty recently) died.\nHere's where l'm wondering if AlTA...\nI sent my dad a message to say I'm happy for him but feel theyve not though about our grief and would've liked to be asked first before being added to a hen group. But most importantly remember certain dates, i.e. the anniversary, and not send wedding invites in the days/week before this time. He replied saying \"sorry l'm not being thoughtful enough.l'll make sure to check with you beforehand\". Not it might've been insensitive to send his kids wedding invites just before the anniversary. I said I don\u2019t want him to run everything by me, just remember we\u2019re grieving. Then he blamed the post and said that it wasn't their fault it arrived on the day. Now I think he's avoiding me.

You and your siblings are grieving your mum but you can't really even lean on your dad because he's done a speed run at dating. And now on top of your grief, you're trying to figure out two new family dynamics, the one where your mum is gone and the one where your dad has a new, young wife. \n\nI think your response to him was completely appropriate. Do I think the post thing was a mishap? Probably. But it doesn't hurt to ask him to be a bit more mindful where he can.", "You shouldn't go to the Hen party. It's for her friends. Bloody insensitive I think.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is so focused on his own feelings he\u2019s forgotten (or didn\u2019t ever realise in the first place) that his children are grieving. In addition, his upcoming wedding is likely a way for him to avoid his grief and pain. How well it will work, only time will tell. \n\nYour dad did a shitty thing and got called out on it. Instead of copping to it, he\u2019s turned defensive and tried to make it your fault (and the post\u2019s fault which doesn\u2019t hold up given the call to your gran the next day). Whether you decide to let him off the hook or not is your call. Talking to the fianc\u00e9e about it might be an option?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. My mum died at 62 and her partner (of three years so different to a spouse of decades) started dating within months of her death. Fortunately I have no reason to remain in contact with him so I am not confronted with his actions every day.", "NTA. My mum died (also late 50s) of cancer and not even a year later my dad asked me for a plus-one to my wedding. I asked him to consider how I would feel seeing someone sitting in the seat my mother should have occupied at church and then at the reception. He didn\u2019t challenge this but blamed my \u2018sensitivity\u2019 for my reaction (teary but calm).", "NTA for raising it as a concern, but the chances you're going to receive a genuine apology or the deserved heartfelt conversation are minimal at best. \n\nThere's a chance he'll understand the hurt he's caused and reach out, but there's a higher chance he'll sulk, pout and wait to throw this in your face .. Please be prepared for the selfish army to return resolute in their decision. Hold your high and stand by your siblings / maternal family - they need you more.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, I am so sorry for your loss. I am very close with my mom, and I can not even imagine the pain you are experiencing.\n\nSecondly, I will say something that you and other people will probably disagree with and will hurt you, but here it is.\n\nI think your father never actually cared for your mother in a healthy way (cheating and abuse during their marriage, now moving on quickly after her death). I believe you should accept that, and with that in mind, you should approach his relationship with his current partner.\n\nHe put your mother through a lot of humiliation during her life and what you should do is remember her and try to preserve all the memories you have of her (pictures and videos, you should go with the people who cared for her to visit her favourite places, listen to her favourite music, watch her favourite movies). He might start erasing her from your home and it would be good to save everything of hers.\n\nAsking your father to think about your feelings is pointless because he didn't care about your mom or you while cheating. Don't talk to him about how all of this is hurting you because he will turn around and say how selfish you are. So don't give him a reason to blame you for anything.\n\nRegarding the wedding, I would approach it like a task/homework and try not to get emotionally involved. Answer only when you are asked directly and do it the way he wants it. Don't be rude, just do it, and once everything is done or when it gets too much, surround yourself with people who want to remember your mother and do something that would make her smile.", "NTA\n\nSorry but your dad is a huge ass for this imo.\n\nit's cool if he find someone else, and pretty fast after your mom death. Good for him, really, but it's not hard to understand and respect the fact that the rest of the family might still be very affected and still be processing the death of a loved one. \n\nEspecially his own children, who lost their mother, and his parents, who lost their daughter !  \n\nI mean no shit your grandad refuse the invite and got upset for it, i would have smack the shit out your dad if i was him... That's beyond disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry this is happening. \n\nYour dad is so wrapped up in \" moving on \" / with a much younger fianc\u00e9e as well ... / That he completely disregarded everyone else in the process. \n\nNot sending out invitations so close to the anniversary is just basic logistics, but he just didn't think. He can blame the post all he wants , but the truth is, the fact this might be painful for you or his late wife's parents, just didn't occur to him. He is building a new life and the old life is now gone, done. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9e also didn't at all consider that whilst for her this is an exciting time and she's free to start planning the hen with her mates, her future husband's children are still navigating their grief from losing their mother. \n\nThey are both just self centred, inconsiderate people, and you need to protect your own wellbeing at this point. Your dad already told you where he stands... \nMaybe once the dust settles and the excitement of the new relationship wears off, you can have a frank conversation with him about this, but right now, I think, all you'd get is half apologies.", "NTA there was nothing wrong with your message or request. He is being insensitive and frankly so is she. How did neither of them think about the fact that the anniversary was then?", "Unfortunately it's a very real stereotype for some men to speedrun the replacement of their spouse asap.  Sometimes even while she's ill.  \n\nNTA.  Your dad didn't even bother to read the room or remember to consider even a scrap of empathy for you and your mother's family.", "I'm so sorry you are going through this, my dad also met his new girlfriend within 6 months of mum dying. And it's been so hard on the rest of the family (not helped by her being an absolutely awful human). \n\nHe refused to come to my first born child's 1st birthday because the new gf wasn't invited - the fact that my mum died 3 weeks before my child was born and was clearly a really hard reminder for me that my mum should have been there didn't even occur to him. \n\nThe only advice I can give you is to set some boundaries and stick to them, if you allow him to trample on your feelings at the beginning in the vague hope he might eventually learn to be more sensitive then you are setting yourself up for failure. I can't say it'll get easier, it certainly hasn't for me, but at least over time your grief won't be so overwhelming on top of dealing with an insensitive parent. Look after yourself x", "NTA\n\nI am very sorry for your loss, this must be a very difficult time for you. \n\nYou are not asking him to not get married nor do you seem to be hostile about the fact that he is remarrying. You have simply made your feelings known and asked them to respect that which considering the insensitive actions (intended or not) is completely fair enough. \n\nIf you are to consider his feelings in wanting to get remarried to move on he should consider yours in doing what you have asked. Everybody is trying to learn how to navigate life with grief, it is different for everybody and the path is not easy or clear. The best we can all do is support each other as best we can. And for that to happen feelings need to be communicated. I hope you can all work through this. \n\nIF he is more concerned about this being a dampener to the wedding then there is the bigger issues of your feelings being second to his new life. I hope that is not true and everything works out.", "[deleted]", "Why do men move on so fast during the dying process or after their female partner dies? Because they need a woman to subsidize their lifestyle.", "OP, you mentioned in a comment that your father used to be physically abusive, and that he cheated on your mother. there is no universe in which you could be in the wrong here. NTA, and also i would strongly recommend going low/no contact with your father, and seeking therapy or similar for everything you've been through.", "NTA. As a matter of fact you\u2019re not the asshole ENOUGH. I\u2019d be way more of an asshole. Sorry about your mama \ud83d\udc94 she\u2019s always with you.", "NTA But I have to say I'm wondering why you're even still talking to him. I've read your comments about all the cheating and what he did at your wedding. Honestly I would have quit talking to him long ago. I certainly wouldn't be going to his wedding.", "NTA. Sending it on the anniversary is pretty insensitive.", "Well your dad sounds like a dick... that's what he seems to be thinking with in any case. \nIt personally makes my stomach churn seeing old men date young women ... or old women date young men. It's gross. \nYou're totally NTA, and have every right to be hurt by his thoughtless actions. \nSadly I think he stopped loving your mother a long time ago. My MIL passed away 15 years ago, my FIL cried for her every single day. Never wanted another partner, even still signed her name in every card and kept using her email address.  In 2021 he finally joined her. THAT is true love.", "How old is everyone in this scenario? I have very different advice if ppl are in there 30s to if everyone is early 20s.\n\nMy dad died of cancer and my mum met my stepfather at a cancer widower (his wife had died a few months earlier) support group 6 weeks later. At the time I didn't understand it, but now as an adult I do. My mum, like my stepfather and many other ppl, doesn't like being alone. She needed the companionship you can only get within a relationship. My father's parents mourned him forever, my sister and I still reflect on what our lives would have been like even after 35 years since his passing, my mum moved on. She was devastated when he died (refused to let go of the coffin in the cemetery devastated) but ultimately a partner and the place that fills in your life can't be fulfilled by a memory, it is replaceable only by the living. For my grandparents and my sister and I, his memory can fill the void his death left.\n\nSo where does that leave you after 2 years .... Well that depends on your age. If you are very young I think your father needs to be a lot more sensitive to your emotions. If you are in your late 20s, early 30s I think you need to realise that while you still may be grieving it's a bit cruel to ask your father after 2 full years to structure his planning around your grief. It hurts watching your parent move on, it feels like your parent is being replaced, their memory erased, their mark on this world gone. It really really hurts and if you are young and still without fully cooked brains your father should be very sensitive to this pain, but there gets to a point (and personally I think for ppl 30ish plus it's about 6 months) where unless it's an overtly cruel or insensitive action you need to just process the grief seperate from your father. I do agree with you that the invitation timing was a slip up but it wasn't intentional.\n\nMy grandpa used to tell me that death is hardest on those left behind but we should never allow our grief to become the millstone around our necks.", "NTA. That apology doesnt seem like a genuine one either. \n\nHes ready to move on, and he expects everyone else too. \n\nYou are and your siblings are adults. You dont have to be there or support him if you are not ready. Its not fair to be tossed into something for someone elses sake. Im a strong believer in if an event is a mockery or misery for you or the pain or grief you are experiencing - you shouldn't be there. Imagine how you would look in pics. Your face will be forced, you will be stressed, can you genuinely wish them happiness in that state?", "NAH. It\u2019s reasonable for you not to like this situation, but it\u2019s reasonable for your dad to move on. You will grieve your mother for the rest of your life. Your father is older and is ready to move on - your mother was not his mother. \n\nIt\u2019s complicated and therefore NAH.", "NTA sounds like you are completely right and he\u2019s so wrapped up in himself that he couldn\u2019t see beyond his own selfish wants and wishes.", "I\u2019m so sorry, OP. The same thing happened to me. \n\nPrepare yourself for your Dad to go full-on into his new life without so much as a second glance. My mother was literally never mentioned again after my Dad remarried. It\u2019s extremely hurtful. \n\nNow is the time to get hold of any of your mother\u2019s possessions which remain in your Dad\u2019s house.", "YTA. There is a time and place for everything. Two years not that long but long enough you should separate the issue. You said it was \u201cyour issue\u201d. Let your dad have his day, it\u2019s time to move on. No one is disrespecting anyone only you are . It could be worse and on the day.", "OP, some people are terrible at dates.  Do you actually believe that your father intentionally sent those invitations on a date at or near the date of your mother's passing?  Your father is probably just oblivious to the exact date.  This is hard for you, but it seems like you are looking for missteps on the part of your father.", "Yta. Your mum is dead. She isn't replacing your mum. You're all adults.

You're being way too kind with him. He seems to have lost his mind a bit with this new relationship. Probably, assuming he loved your mum, it's his unhealthy way to cope with grief - ignoring it and moving on. But he can't ignore his sons and daughters grief while coping however he wants. His excuse of not being his fault if the invitations arrived that day is super lame, because even if it's true \u2013 and I don't think it was calculated or he'd be a psycho \u2013\u00a0at the same time he didn't send any message to you or your grandparents related to the anniversary, or thought to apologize when he realized people where replying to him on that date, so it was not on his mind at all. And having to find an excuse instead of just apologizing is immature and defensive itself. Even the fact he hasn't talked to your mom's parents since the date of the funeral is pretty strange. I'm really sorry. Again, you're being way too mature and kind about all this, if anything. Don't even think you're being an AH.\n\nEDIT to add I'm reading some of your comments and yes, he's always been a prick. cheated on your mom, went to happily live with another woman, then came back, and after your mum's death he dated the woman she had cheated her with? You are justifying him way too much. He's always found a way to do whatever he pleased disregarding others' feelings and getting away with it. Possibly you've been emotionally manipulated by him too. I think you need to keep a civil relationship with him if you feel you don't need other dramas, but I'd try and have the least possible exposure to him from now on.

OP didnt say her father couldnt  get married or move on, she just asked him to be respectful of her feelings. A reasonable request", "Ok. We range from 36-26. If I\u2019m honest I think I was quite numb for about 1 year and some months after my mums death. I couldn\u2019t even cry, just numb, but the grief hit hardest for me personally around 7-8 months ago.

I am so sorry your mom passed away. It has been 12 years for me and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t miss my Mom.  He is being callous and insensitive tbh.  \n\nThe audacity of contacting your maternal grandparents who only lost their daughter 2 years ago to invite them to his new happy life? WTF - does your Dad have any compassion? I am not saying he can\u2019t be happy and in a relationship but 0-60 seconds while running over people just 2 years out. It is beyond the pale.  Personally I would tell my grandmother she doesn\u2019t have to go.  It is too much to ask a woman to watch this.

I don\u2019t care if you are 12 or 24 or 54. Two years is to fast. Personally I would cut him and his fianc\u00e9e wife off.  I would not go to anything at this point.  He is avoiding you guys because he can hide from that voice in his head telling him he is being a gigantic jack ass.  There is no way after 2 years at your age I could have watched my Dad remarry. It too soon.  I won\u2019t even address the age and the like of any compassion by his fianc\u00e9e.  She sounds like a whole other post.

It's okay to be hurt. It's okay to be sad and to grieve that he he isn't present or able to meet your needs.

Not every small unintentional hurt needs to be brought up. If it's a pattern or if it was deliberate, sure, but everyone is thoughtless occasionally.

My mother earned a lot of money while she was alive (how she supported 6 children and a delinquent husband).

They don't want to change, and we don't need the stress, so despite the fact that as humans we're designed to want our parents approval/love, sometimes it's easier to go to therapy than to keep banging your head against against the same stubborn jerkface who's supposed to love you.\n\nBesides, they seem perfectly capable of making their own excuses.

Where is the empathy?\n\nHaving said that, I remember someone once saying that a widower remarrying can be seen as a confirmation of a good marriage to his first wife: if he hadn't had a good experience, he wouldn't be quick to enter a another marriage.   For many men, 2 years is a long time.\n\nBut your dad is not being sensitive to any of you who understandably aren't ready to see a new wife and a much younger one at that, on his arm.\n\nI feel foe all of you - your siblings and grandparents.

Younger people usually have more of a social life outside family but for your g'parents, their daughter was probably a huge part of their lives. \n\nNTA.", "I understand. What I would do is to enjoy the house as much as possible. If you are able, you could organize a sleepover/party with your siblings and your mom's parents to just have fun in the house and to have the best possible goodbye to the incredible home as a thank you to your mom. Take as many pictures and videos as you can to remember it all. I would film a video and go into each room and share the best memories of your mom you all have. \n\n\n\nAlso, what is your relationship with your dad's fiancee?

How are her family and friends treating you?", "You really think he sat there and went \"hmmmm, the anniversary of my wife's death is next week, I want to send a signal to the world by sending out my new wedding invites today\" or do you think he went \"yay, invites are done, I'll drop them at the post box tomorrow\". When you are counting instances that you consider thoughtless or cruel just remember that even if it hurt you doesn't mean it falls into the thoughtless or cruel category. It hurts watching your parent move on, but you are all adults with fully cooked brains. He doesn't need to tiptoe around your grief, especially after 2 years which is actually a pretty long time.\n\nAlso, just as additional info because I'm a family solicitor. Across my career I couldn't count the number of men I've seen die within 12 months of their wife, women however seem to be fine, but so many men completely collapse. I've formed the opinion that in general men are just not good at being alone. No idea why, it's just a trend you notice when you have been in the game for as long as I have.", "He has other anniversaries that you don't even know about. After our mom died, my sister's and I would go to lunch on her death date and to the cemetery. Our dad did not. He had first kiss, first date, first home memories that we did not. I think grief for a parent and grief for a spouse are completely different. Also, I find that as I age, loss becomes less traumatic. Maybe it's the accumulation of many losses. Your father has lost both parents, his wife, probably a sibling or 2, numerous friends, and relatives, and possibly a child. Grief is not new to him.", "Not thinking about it at all is honestly not much better though in my opinion, if, when it does get brought to thier attention, it does not elicit even a tiny modicum of an apology or regret. \n\nI'm sorry to say it, but he doesn't care about your grief, just like he doesn't care about losing your mom and likely only cares about his new partner because she is still shiny and young and new. When that novelty wears off he will treat her just the same as he treated the woman who worked herself to the bone to support his lazy philandering ass- as disposable.\n\n I'm sad for you and your family, I'm sad for your mom that she didn't have a better partner, and I'm even a bit sad that your dad's new partner doesn't realize she should demand better for herself than a man who could act like this.\n\n I think you are way too hard on yourself about possibly dampening your dad's \"joy\" (barf). He's rubbing your nose in it, and it doesn't matter if it wasn't intentional because he's certainly not trying NOT to, nor sorry about it after the fact.\n\nHe's not going to worry about hurting your feelings it seems, so you don't need to stretch yourself so thin out of worry you'll hurt his at your own expense.", "Yes, I think regarding my grandparents that was pretty poor. They lost their child.

It could be that dates and anniversaries don't register with him as much as with you and your siblings and grandparents (I am one of those people - i miss my mom terribly, but the anniversary of her death isn't of any special importance to me), so it might not have occurred to him that it was a bad time to send out invites.  That said, you let him know how it made you feel, and at the very least he should have felt some remorse for even inadvertently causing pain to his own children and to in-laws that he was obviously close to, or he wouldn't want to include them in a new wedding.  \n\nI would like to give your dad the benefit of the doubt, and assume that this was not intentional.

My best friend of 23 years lost her mom when we where 22 (so like 5 years ago now). She woke up and went to play tennis and then while on the court she had a stroke which ruptured a brain aneurysm.\n\nIt was sudden and tragic.

There\u2019s so many things you still needed your mom for. \n\nWhat\u2019s different here is that it sounds like your parents where still in love with eachother (my friend\u2019s dad is a narcissist and by the time his wife died he was already cheating on her and he also got married within two years) \n\nIn this case I\u2019m thinking that the dating of someone and getting engaged so quickly also is coinciding with him not wanting to feel the grief. He doesn\u2019t seem to be letting it wash over him and doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of it. \n\nI think you pointing out that you and your siblings are still in the throes of grief to him feels like an attack on his moral character. Probably because deep down he knows this is too quick or he is doing this for potentially the wrong reasons despite if your future step mom was/is actually the right person for him. \n\nI think if he continues with the lack of care and awareness it\u2019s worth sitting him down and having a bigger conversation about him respecting your grieving process. And if he continues to claim you not being full throated in your support, in whatever his definition of that is, then I think you need to decide if you and your siblings want to attend or be involved. At some point you can\u2019t force him to respect your boundaries. You need to respect them for yourself and part of that is respecting the loss that has occurred in your life. So hopefully this will all work out and you and your siblings will go and your dad will understand how this is a pain spot for you. Hopefully you all will be able to talk it through (maybe trying family therapy could help too since you will have a mediator essentially) and then it will be something that makes you all stronger and connected as a family. \n\nBut don\u2019t let him steamroll your grief because it\u2019s convenient for him. My friend\u2019s dad did that to her. And he only really acknowledges their mom because his new wife (who is wonderful) expects him to behave a certain way (ie a decent dad) and he\u2019s to scared she will leave him.

I would be afraid of doing something stupid as well. \n\nIn this case, when the new wife is so much younger, I think he will eventually realize that he does not have that close communication that he once had.

If he is 60 years old she will soon be nursing him through the first signs of aging like cataracts, knee replacements, and the usual aches and pains of aging. \n\nWhat I am saying is that I can understand why the father would fall for a young vibrant woman, but I fear that he will eventually regret this marriage.

But if OP doesn't tell her, we have a woman unknowingly marrying a husband who treats his kids callously and has no respect for his late wife, AND is set up for potentially lots of strife due to being rejected by her husbands family. This doesn't scream feminism either. I agree with that burdening her with more 'wifely responsibilities' is problematic, but to me, telling her at least lets her make an informed decision- though it may increase her burden, it's her choice to take it on.

This guy hasn\u2019t earned the benefit of the doubt.", "I would post about his behaviour directly into that whatsApp group and how insensitive it is to send out wedding invitations on someones death anniversary, especially when it hasn\u2019t even been that long since it happened. I would also not attend  if I were you", "I am so sorry for you loss of your mom.  It's so distressing to have on top of that your dad's bliss over his new partner . . . and neglecting you and your siblings and grandparents who are all still grieving. Some people can be enormously insensitive and unapologetic about it too . . .. You are not the AH but tried to gift you dad to have a little more understanding about his family's feelings instead of running rough shod over them. You did nothing to put a damper on his \"bliss\" but the rest of you are struggling and he needed to know . ..  now it's up to him to understand everyone else but I wouldn't hold my breath.  . . . sending virtual hugs.", "Seems like he could have mitigated at least a tiny bit of the hurt if he\u2019d just given y\u2019all a heads up that they were coming instead of it being a surprise. And texting your grandma seems cruel. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong at all.", "You can\u2019t blame him from when the mail gets delivered. I do think you\u2019re being unfair to him. He has moved on your haven\u2019t and that\u2019s ok but you can\u2019t expect him to run things by you. You say you don\u2019t want that but how\u2019s he supposed to know what to run by you and not? Your grief is yours to process, it\u2019s been two years. How long do you want him to walk on needles around you", "Oh this is some very important context.  Your dad has always been selfish and always been a jerk.  Of course he's behaving the way he is now, he's the main character in his life.  Other people's feelings, pffft, what are those?  I'm sorry OP, but I'm glad that you've got your siblings and your grandparents to rely on for emotional support.", "OP could your dad be spiraling because of grief? He\u2019s behaviour sounds addictive, like he can\u2019t be alone, he will fulfill the void by any means it\u2019s that painful? \n\nHas he had therapy? Could you ask him to go to therapy with you and your siblings (if you want). It would be a shame not to at least try that route before you step back.\n\nEdit: never mind just read your dad cheated on your mum.", "I agree but if the OP and her family want anything that belonged to their mum they need to get over and take it before the new wife \u201cdecorates\u201d to make her stamp on the house", "Move past the grief. \n\nThat said, there are now two \u201clittle\u201d girls named (same first, middle and last name) for my mother. My brother\u2019s eldest named for our mother just got married two months ago and my eldest likewise names for our mother is about to turn 18\u2026\n\nI do totally understand though the stress you are going through. I was upset with my father when I was much younger over his dating.", "Two years is not a lot, especially when losing a parent you had a proper relationship with and many memories. I lost my dad 2 years and 2 months ago. I thought the first Christmas without him would be the hardest thing in the mourning process, I was wrong. This Christmas, the second without him, hit me like a train. Grief for someone you love and have tons of memories with seems never ending. And special days are particularly heavy. Stay strong, wishing you and your siblings the best,", "Yes there absolutely is. Do you think 20 years of grief is fine? What about 30? When it prevents you from returning to a normal life, its been to long. You can't grieve forever. Years is plenty of time.", "OP said that dad has abandoned the house and moved in with the fianc\u00e9e - little brother is currently living there.  Dad is planning on selling it.  So they're perfectly placed to take what is special to them before dad erases their mother from his life.", "I hope your username is not a reflection to your RL job!   \nTwo years IS pretty recent. And how friggin hard is it, if you're not a narcissist, to not let a wedding invite arrive on the anniversary of someones death!", "Let me get this straight\u2026.you\u2019re a nurse? Based on your username and your post about working in a hospital. Should you really be in a caring role? I\u2019d hate to come across you as a patient", "My grandma passed away 2 years ago next week at 101. My mom is still dealing with the emotional fallout. There is no such thing as \"long enough\" to have to be over it. I hope you and your siblings are able to attend some grief counseling to help you process your feelings.", "I send you a hug, I lost my mom 7 years ago when I was 23. You will never \"be over it\" but you will learn to live with it with time. I needed about 3 years to stop crying every time I thought about her, now I can remember her while smiling and laughing with family. My dad found another woman quite early too but he still hasn't remarried, I understand how hard it is seeing your father building a new relationship when you still aren't ready.", "Good call I didn\u2019t even notice that and I am a women.", "Ouch. New Wife is in for a ride, then. I kinda feel sorry for her.", "He sounds like a treat! Lol. I\u2019m gonna say this from the child perspective of having a narcissistic grandparent, don\u2019t do it for the kids. My mom and her siblings have been through hell with their dad. It took years for them to finally cut him off and that just happened a few years ago. I\u2019ll be honest, as a little kid he was great but you find out VERY quickly who your grandparent is. I don\u2019t think I liked my grandfather since I was about 8. I wish my family went NC with him when I was a child cause it would have saved us alot of drama.", "Isn\u2019t it \u2018funny\u2019 that an army of women have to come together to manage this full grown man behavior so that he doesn\u2019t hurt everyone around him?\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, yes, but it does exist and no matter how much you want someone to be self-aware and take accountability, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t happen. So OP has a choice of whether to continue to try to school Dad, who doesn\u2019t seem very self-aware or have much emotional intelligence or she can see whether she can have an ally in New Wife to help mitigate Dad\u2019s cluelessness. If the first, resentment will likely grow thru the years. If the second, Dad (in his current state of bliss) will likely be much more open to accepting New Wife\u2019s influence here And hopefully be of help. This is assuming, of course, that New Wife has emotional sensitivity to the current situation, which she may not have a full picture of. Dollars to donuts that Dad is probably just complaining about his kids so she only hears one side of the story. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to give it a try. At the very least, OP will get a gauge on her future relationship with New Wife. OP sounds very grounded and naturally gracious, so if They are able to have a civil discussion, it could be very helpful.", "Fair point. Could be true but a maxim I like is Hanlon\u2019s Razor\u2026 loosely paraphrased as never immediately attribute to malice what simple ignorance could reasonably explain.", "Yeah, every single bachelor party I've been invited to has been via text group and that isn't a particularly new thing", "Wow! That\u2019s actually really good insight to have it from the POV of the grandchild. My dad is a lot of \u201cfun\u201d around the kids\u2026.honestly, when he were little children we was a very \u201cfun dad\u201d. But I\u2019d say about the same age, around 8-9 it drastically turned, particularly towards me for some reason. He was so volatile towards me and I think I was 9-10 when he first physically pushed me down the stairs for no reason (or no reason that I can remember).\n\nBut if you say your grandfather was the same and showing that narcism even to the grandkids as they grew older then perhaps distancing from him truly is best. It\u2019s hard to explain to children when they\u2019re so young, but my nieces are slightly older now and I think are beginning to realise.", "What do you think is wrong with their relationship?", "There are so many things wrong with that statement. It's like you think that women only value men for their dicks or their paychecks. \n\nMen can be interesting. They can be funny and smart and have interesting experiences to share.  They can be skilled at things we might want to learn. They can be fun to do things with. Should women cut themselves off from people who genuinely bring positive things to their lives just because they don't want to have sex with that person? Is sex the coinage that women have to use to buy the presence of fun people in their lives if those people happen to be men?", "Because 8 or 9 is when kids start to develop their own mind so that it shows outwardly, something a narcissist cannot abide. Narcissists \"love\" their families in that they are extensions of themselves - that's why they're usually great with the very young children, at those ages kids are little monkey-see-monkey-do creatures, which is great for a narcissist's ego. Once that begins to change, they are forced to exert control using their litany of emotional abuse and manipulation tactics.", "Ugh. I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience all that with your dad. My mom has so many stories about my grandpa where I\u2019m just thankful I\u2019m his grandkid and not his actual child. My cousins and I never got it as bad as my mom and her siblings but it still made a huge impact on my life. All I\u2019m saying is if you are only keeping in contact with him because your kids, just know that in a few years he probably won\u2019t be the \u201cfun\u201d grandpa anymore and you will start seeing his narcissistic personality shine with them sooner or later.", "Without knowing them, I have no way of knowing the particulars.\n\nI\u2019m speaking in broader sense. I\u2019m absolutely comfortable side eyeing someone whose children are the same age as their spouse. It will raise eyebrows. Add in the weird pressure they\u2019re putting on the op, it feels even weirder in this particular case. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is the same power imbalance that would be going on if she were in her 20s with the same age difference, but unless he is her boss or supervisor or otherwise holds a position of authority over her, it\u2019s not necessarily an inappropriate age gap", "Maybe your dad didn\u2019t intentionally send the invites but what about the fianc\u00e9? Would she do it intentionally?", "Of course men can be interesting, etc. and platonic relationships are not only possible but common. \n\nI was specifically referring to when a woman ends a relationship with a man by using the line, \"I would like to be friends\". In that intstance, those words clearly state, \"Sure we can be friends, but we will not be dating and there will be no sex\".  It is the most commonly used \"let down\" line used in the English language for someone who does not want a personal relationship. (Second most used is probably, \"It's not you, it's me\".) \n\nIn colloquial English, \"friend zone\" only means \"You are not getting any\". Nothing to do with friendship.", "I\u2019ve never thought of it like that, but that makes total sense", "I honestly have no idea. We don\u2019t really know her all that well. We\u2019ve met her a few times, but I\u2019ve only ever had surface level conversation I say she seems nice based only on that. \nMy twin has spoken with her the most out of all of us but is convinced somethings amiss\u2026though she admitted that may be due to how she\u2019s feeling about our mum.", "He\u2019s got that right!", "Abdication of responsibility for their actions/victim blaming are 2 of a narcissist's main features... think about the stereotypical abuser line, \"why do you make me do this to you?\" \n\nNow think about what that really means, and what they're really saying. \"If you would just do/be exactly what I want you to instead of having your own agency and being your own person with your own thoughts and feelings, I wouldn't be *forced* to abuse you in order to bend you to my will.\" A very small child is going to be much more moldable than one who can think for themselves, no? The minute they are cognitively developed enough to have opinions or wants different from the narcissistic parent/grandparent, they go from safe to at risk.", "It\u2019s seems so calculated to receive the invitation on the anniversary. There is just no way that was dumb luck, Your dad seems completely oblivious and a complete jerk but not out right cruel. It does, however, sound like something an extremely insecure, immature and very jealous new \u201cyounger\u201d fianc\u00e9 would do.", "This happened after my great-grandpa died. Ggrandmother passed when my mother was 6, he remarried in the 1960's. \n\nWhen I was 12 or so Ggrandfather was gone and his 2nd wife passed, and my grandmother & mother asked after anything of my great-grandma's. Nothing to do with the 2nd wife's kids, but they inherited after 2nd wife & I got to watch the auction with my mom & grandma. Pictures, quilts she made, their marriage bed from the 20's...It was heartbreaking, I still remember it after 30+ years."]}
