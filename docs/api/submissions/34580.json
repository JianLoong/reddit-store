My parents were married and happy, of course it was so hard for all us.\nIn under a year he met a new woman and then months later announce they\u2019re engaged. It\u2019s a short engagement, about 8-9 months from getting engaged till the actual wedding. I do understand a lot of people (seemingly more widowed men from stories l've others have told me) find someone very quickly and often be remarried before a year even, so l'm trying not to be naive here.\nFor my siblings and l it has been a little strange as for us as we are still processing the death of our mother but also the new fiance is only a few years older than me and my sister who are the eldest. we've tried our best to make an effort to be happy for him and be welcoming to her, all while processing our grief.\nMy issue is that he so wrapped up with his new fianc\u00e9 that he\u2019s forgotten we are still grieving. To the point that on the 2 year anniversary of our mums death 3 of us got their wedding invite in the post while the others the day after. It hurt all of us that they didn\u2019t think about this date in the days/week leading up to it, but I decided to leave it as I didn't want to taint their joy.\nHe sent a message to my grandma (my mums mum) out of the blue after no contact since the funeral (I was with my grandma at the time) asking for their address so he could send them an invite the day after the anniversary, hence we were with my grandparents to support each other.\nNot asking how they were at this time/how they were coping with loss of their daughter/whether they\u2019d be ok with an invite... just stating they were being invited and he needed their address. My dear grandma said she\u2019d like to attend for our sake, though my grandad refused point blank and was too upset to talk further.\nA month later me and my sisters were added to the hen do WhatsApp group with all new fianc\u00e9s friends all now chatting excitedly and planning the hen.\nFor us that was another pang of heartache, as we are only in this position coz our mum (pretty recently) died.\nHere's where l'm wondering if AlTA...\nI sent my dad a message to say I'm happy for him but feel theyve not though about our grief and would've liked to be asked first before being added to a hen group. But most importantly remember certain dates, i.e. the anniversary, and not send wedding invites in the days/week before this time. He replied saying \"sorry l'm not being thoughtful enough.l'll make sure to check with you beforehand\". Not it might've been insensitive to send his kids wedding invites just before the anniversary. I said I don\u2019t want him to run everything by me, just remember we\u2019re grieving. Then he blamed the post and said that it wasn't their fault it arrived on the day. Now I think he's avoiding me.

You and your siblings are grieving your mum but you can't really even lean on your dad because he's done a speed run at dating. And now on top of your grief, you're trying to figure out two new family dynamics, the one where your mum is gone and the one where your dad has a new, young wife. \n\nI think your response to him was completely appropriate. Do I think the post thing was a mishap? Probably. But it doesn't hurt to ask him to be a bit more mindful where he can.", "You shouldn't go to the Hen party. It's for her friends. Bloody insensitive I think.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is so focused on his own feelings he\u2019s forgotten (or didn\u2019t ever realise in the first place) that his children are grieving. In addition, his upcoming wedding is likely a way for him to avoid his grief and pain. How well it will work, only time will tell. \n\nYour dad did a shitty thing and got called out on it. Instead of copping to it, he\u2019s turned defensive and tried to make it your fault (and the post\u2019s fault which doesn\u2019t hold up given the call to your gran the next day). Whether you decide to let him off the hook or not is your call. Talking to the fianc\u00e9e about it might be an option?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. My mum died at 62 and her partner (of three years so different to a spouse of decades) started dating within months of her death. Fortunately I have no reason to remain in contact with him so I am not confronted with his actions every day.", "NTA. My mum died (also late 50s) of cancer and not even a year later my dad asked me for a plus-one to my wedding. I asked him to consider how I would feel seeing someone sitting in the seat my mother should have occupied at church and then at the reception. He didn\u2019t challenge this but blamed my \u2018sensitivity\u2019 for my reaction (teary but calm).", "NTA for raising it as a concern, but the chances you're going to receive a genuine apology or the deserved heartfelt conversation are minimal at best. \n\nThere's a chance he'll understand the hurt he's caused and reach out, but there's a higher chance he'll sulk, pout and wait to throw this in your face .. Please be prepared for the selfish army to return resolute in their decision. Hold your high and stand by your siblings / maternal family - they need you more.", "NTA\n\nFirstly, I am so sorry for your loss. I am very close with my mom, and I can not even imagine the pain you are experiencing.\n\nSecondly, I will say something that you and other people will probably disagree with and will hurt you, but here it is.\n\nI think your father never actually cared for your mother in a healthy way (cheating and abuse during their marriage, now moving on quickly after her death). I believe you should accept that, and with that in mind, you should approach his relationship with his current partner.\n\nHe put your mother through a lot of humiliation during her life and what you should do is remember her and try to preserve all the memories you have of her (pictures and videos, you should go with the people who cared for her to visit her favourite places, listen to her favourite music, watch her favourite movies). He might start erasing her from your home and it would be good to save everything of hers.\n\nAsking your father to think about your feelings is pointless because he didn't care about your mom or you while cheating. Don't talk to him about how all of this is hurting you because he will turn around and say how selfish you are. So don't give him a reason to blame you for anything.\n\nRegarding the wedding, I would approach it like a task/homework and try not to get emotionally involved. Answer only when you are asked directly and do it the way he wants it. Don't be rude, just do it, and once everything is done or when it gets too much, surround yourself with people who want to remember your mother and do something that would make her smile.", "NTA\n\nSorry but your dad is a huge ass for this imo.\n\nit's cool if he find someone else, and pretty fast after your mom death. Good for him, really, but it's not hard to understand and respect the fact that the rest of the family might still be very affected and still be processing the death of a loved one. \n\nEspecially his own children, who lost their mother, and his parents, who lost their daughter !  \n\nI mean no shit your grandad refuse the invite and got upset for it, i would have smack the shit out your dad if i was him... That's beyond disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry this is happening. \n\nYour dad is so wrapped up in \" moving on \" / with a much younger fianc\u00e9e as well ... / That he completely disregarded everyone else in the process. \n\nNot sending out invitations so close to the anniversary is just basic logistics, but he just didn't think. He can blame the post all he wants , but the truth is, the fact this might be painful for you or his late wife's parents, just didn't occur to him. He is building a new life and the old life is now gone, done. \n\nHis fianc\u00e9e also didn't at all consider that whilst for her this is an exciting time and she's free to start planning the hen with her mates, her future husband's children are still navigating their grief from losing their mother. \n\nThey are both just self centred, inconsiderate people, and you need to protect your own wellbeing at this point. Your dad already told you where he stands... \nMaybe once the dust settles and the excitement of the new relationship wears off, you can have a frank conversation with him about this, but right now, I think, all you'd get is half apologies.", "NTA there was nothing wrong with your message or request. He is being insensitive and frankly so is she. How did neither of them think about the fact that the anniversary was then?", "Unfortunately it's a very real stereotype for some men to speedrun the replacement of their spouse asap.  Sometimes even while she's ill.  \n\nNTA.  Your dad didn't even bother to read the room or remember to consider even a scrap of empathy for you and your mother's family.", "I'm so sorry you are going through this, my dad also met his new girlfriend within 6 months of mum dying. And it's been so hard on the rest of the family (not helped by her being an absolutely awful human). \n\nHe refused to come to my first born child's 1st birthday because the new gf wasn't invited - the fact that my mum died 3 weeks before my child was born and was clearly a really hard reminder for me that my mum should have been there didn't even occur to him. \n\nThe only advice I can give you is to set some boundaries and stick to them, if you allow him to trample on your feelings at the beginning in the vague hope he might eventually learn to be more sensitive then you are setting yourself up for failure. I can't say it'll get easier, it certainly hasn't for me, but at least over time your grief won't be so overwhelming on top of dealing with an insensitive parent. Look after yourself x", "NTA\n\nI am very sorry for your loss, this must be a very difficult time for you. \n\nYou are not asking him to not get married nor do you seem to be hostile about the fact that he is remarrying. You have simply made your feelings known and asked them to respect that which considering the insensitive actions (intended or not) is completely fair enough. \n\nIf you are to consider his feelings in wanting to get remarried to move on he should consider yours in doing what you have asked. Everybody is trying to learn how to navigate life with grief, it is different for everybody and the path is not easy or clear. The best we can all do is support each other as best we can. And for that to happen feelings need to be communicated. I hope you can all work through this. \n\nIF he is more concerned about this being a dampener to the wedding then there is the bigger issues of your feelings being second to his new life. I hope that is not true and everything works out.", "[deleted]", "Why do men move on so fast during the dying process or after their female partner dies? Because they need a woman to subsidize their lifestyle.", "OP, you mentioned in a comment that your father used to be physically abusive, and that he cheated on your mother. there is no universe in which you could be in the wrong here. NTA, and also i would strongly recommend going low/no contact with your father, and seeking therapy or similar for everything you've been through.", "NTA. As a matter of fact you\u2019re not the asshole ENOUGH. I\u2019d be way more of an asshole. Sorry about your mama \ud83d\udc94 she\u2019s always with you.", "NTA But I have to say I'm wondering why you're even still talking to him. I've read your comments about all the cheating and what he did at your wedding. Honestly I would have quit talking to him long ago. I certainly wouldn't be going to his wedding.", "NTA. Sending it on the anniversary is pretty insensitive.", "Well your dad sounds like a dick... that's what he seems to be thinking with in any case. \nIt personally makes my stomach churn seeing old men date young women ... or old women date young men. It's gross. \nYou're totally NTA, and have every right to be hurt by his thoughtless actions. \nSadly I think he stopped loving your mother a long time ago. My MIL passed away 15 years ago, my FIL cried for her every single day. Never wanted another partner, even still signed her name in every card and kept using her email address.  In 2021 he finally joined her. THAT is true love.", "How old is everyone in this scenario? I have very different advice if ppl are in there 30s to if everyone is early 20s.\n\nMy dad died of cancer and my mum met my stepfather at a cancer widower (his wife had died a few months earlier) support group 6 weeks later. At the time I didn't understand it, but now as an adult I do. My mum, like my stepfather and many other ppl, doesn't like being alone. She needed the companionship you can only get within a relationship. My father's parents mourned him forever, my sister and I still reflect on what our lives would have been like even after 35 years since his passing, my mum moved on. She was devastated when he died (refused to let go of the coffin in the cemetery devastated) but ultimately a partner and the place that fills in your life can't be fulfilled by a memory, it is replaceable only by the living. For my grandparents and my sister and I, his memory can fill the void his death left.\n\nSo where does that leave you after 2 years .... Well that depends on your age. If you are very young I think your father needs to be a lot more sensitive to your emotions. If you are in your late 20s, early 30s I think you need to realise that while you still may be grieving it's a bit cruel to ask your father after 2 full years to structure his planning around your grief. It hurts watching your parent move on, it feels like your parent is being replaced, their memory erased, their mark on this world gone. It really really hurts and if you are young and still without fully cooked brains your father should be very sensitive to this pain, but there gets to a point (and personally I think for ppl 30ish plus it's about 6 months) where unless it's an overtly cruel or insensitive action you need to just process the grief seperate from your father. I do agree with you that the invitation timing was a slip up but it wasn't intentional.\n\nMy grandpa used to tell me that death is hardest on those left behind but we should never allow our grief to become the millstone around our necks.", "NTA. That apology doesnt seem like a genuine one either. \n\nHes ready to move on, and he expects everyone else too. \n\nYou are and your siblings are adults. You dont have to be there or support him if you are not ready. Its not fair to be tossed into something for someone elses sake. Im a strong believer in if an event is a mockery or misery for you or the pain or grief you are experiencing - you shouldn't be there. Imagine how you would look in pics. Your face will be forced, you will be stressed, can you genuinely wish them happiness in that state?", "NAH. It\u2019s reasonable for you not to like this situation, but it\u2019s reasonable for your dad to move on. You will grieve your mother for the rest of your life. Your father is older and is ready to move on - your mother was not his mother. \n\nIt\u2019s complicated and therefore NAH.", "NTA sounds like you are completely right and he\u2019s so wrapped up in himself that he couldn\u2019t see beyond his own selfish wants and wishes.", "I\u2019m so sorry, OP. The same thing happened to me. \n\nPrepare yourself for your Dad to go full-on into his new life without so much as a second glance. My mother was literally never mentioned again after my Dad remarried. It\u2019s extremely hurtful. \n\nNow is the time to get hold of any of your mother\u2019s possessions which remain in your Dad\u2019s house.", "YTA. There is a time and place for everything. Two years not that long but long enough you should separate the issue. You said it was \u201cyour issue\u201d. Let your dad have his day, it\u2019s time to move on. No one is disrespecting anyone only you are . It could be worse and on the day.", "OP, some people are terrible at dates.  Do you actually believe that your father intentionally sent those invitations on a date at or near the date of your mother's passing?  Your father is probably just oblivious to the exact date.  This is hard for you, but it seems like you are looking for missteps on the part of your father.", "Yta. Your mum is dead. She isn't replacing your mum. You're all adults.

You're being way too kind with him. He seems to have lost his mind a bit with this new relationship. Probably, assuming he loved your mum, it's his unhealthy way to cope with grief - ignoring it and moving on. But he can't ignore his sons and daughters grief while coping however he wants. His excuse of not being his fault if the invitations arrived that day is super lame, because even if it's true \u2013 and I don't think it was calculated or he'd be a psycho \u2013\u00a0at the same time he didn't send any message to you or your grandparents related to the anniversary, or thought to apologize when he realized people where replying to him on that date, so it was not on his mind at all. And having to find an excuse instead of just apologizing is immature and defensive itself. Even the fact he hasn't talked to your mom's parents since the date of the funeral is pretty strange. I'm really sorry. Again, you're being way too mature and kind about all this, if anything. Don't even think you're being an AH.\n\nEDIT to add I'm reading some of your comments and yes, he's always been a prick. cheated on your mom, went to happily live with another woman, then came back, and after your mum's death he dated the woman she had cheated her with? You are justifying him way too much. He's always found a way to do whatever he pleased disregarding others' feelings and getting away with it. Possibly you've been emotionally manipulated by him too. I think you need to keep a civil relationship with him if you feel you don't need other dramas, but I'd try and have the least possible exposure to him from now on.

OP didnt say her father couldnt  get married or move on, she just asked him to be respectful of her feelings. A reasonable request", "Ok. We range from 36-26. If I\u2019m honest I think I was quite numb for about 1 year and some months after my mums death. I couldn\u2019t even cry, just numb, but the grief hit hardest for me personally around 7-8 months ago.

It was more about the timing of the invites being sent and arriving on the anniversary of our mums death itself.", "My dad did the opposite. He put our mother on a pedestal and no one could ever live up to her memory.(she was awesome, but everyone has faults)  He spent the last 25 years of his life grieving for our mom. He had fun but we always wished he could have found someone. We loved him and spent a lot of time with him, (like almost every day) but, having someone to watch TV with at night, and argue over the news is important.", "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry you have gone through this. I agree, he seems to be going full steam ahead. They even dropped a bombshell that they were going to adopt a kid (my dad should not be a parent again after what we went through with him growing up)\u2026but either way it does seem like he is erasing her from his life.", "His dad sent a notice on the anniversary of HIS wifes death, how are they an AH for GRIEVING THE DEATH OF THEIR MOTHER. Must be nice to be a sociapath though.....", "Ok, what do you mean please by it could be worse on the day? To be clear, I haven\u2019t said we are unhappy he\u2019s remarrying. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m questioning here. For us the alternative is he goes back to his addictions from years ago so I\u2019m happy he is seemingly happy. I think my main upset was that the invites arrived on the day itself of my mums anniversary. So the \u201ctime and place for everything\u201d would perhaps relate to this too, no?", "you really just told someone who is grieving the loss of their mother to \"move on\"\n\nOP is NTA but you sure are for a statement like that", "My brother is.", "Aww thank you.\n\nMy husband is nothing like my dad! He\u2019s incredibly supportive and is the first partner I\u2019ve ever had to call my dad out as well for bad behaviours (there\u2019s been a few..) \nThough looking back at some past boyfriends I now think I did go through some that were scarily similar in behaviour to my dad! \ud83d\ude05", "Well yes, he is wealthy and inherited all our mums assests and wealth too.", "The party the bride has with her friends before the wedding. Like the groom has a stag do and the bride has her hen do", "Okay , that last sentence makes him an asshole.\nHe can take his blissful happiness and shove it where the sun doesn't shine.\n\nYou asked for a modicum of empathy from your father for your siblings and yourself and he can't even muster that?\n\nNTA", "Oh, fuck him then.\n\nDon't go to the wedding, honestly.", "NTA-Dude I would have lit his ass up.  I am so sorry your mom passed away. It has been 12 years for me and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t miss my Mom.  He is being callous and insensitive tbh.  \n\nThe audacity of contacting your maternal grandparents who only lost their daughter 2 years ago to invite them to his new happy life? WTF - does your Dad have any compassion? I am not saying he can\u2019t be happy and in a relationship but 0-60 seconds while running over people just 2 years out. It is beyond the pale.  Personally I would tell my grandmother she doesn\u2019t have to go.  It is too much to ask a woman to watch this.  I literally have tears running down my cheeks from the amount of pain you guys are going through.\n\nI know you want to be strong and there for your Dad but he should be there for you his children.  I don\u2019t care if you are 12 or 24 or 54. Two years is to fast. Personally I would cut him and his fianc\u00e9e wife off.  I would not go to anything at this point.  He is avoiding you guys because he can hide from that voice in his head telling him he is being a gigantic jack ass.  There is no way after 2 years at your age I could have watched my Dad remarry. It too soon.  I won\u2019t even address the age and the like of any compassion by his fianc\u00e9e.  She sounds like a whole other post.  Please remember that you Mom loves you and wherever she is or you believe she is her spirit will always be with you!", "Your Dad never truly loved/respected your Mom, NTA", "From the sounds of it, your dad is someone that it may be healthier for you to go low contact with.\n\nYour post is full of excuses for his awful behaviour, and involves you bending over backwards to avoid even a short conversation with him regarding the fact he's behaving like a prick. Given the extra context, I'll assume that it's because his reaction begins with DARVO, and I'll leave open the possibility that it may escalate from there.\n\nIt's okay to be mad at him. It's okay to be hurt. It's okay to be sad and to grieve that he he isn't present or able to meet your needs. And it's okay to let go and focus on the people and things that DON'T cause you immense stress, guilt, and pain. It's okay to feel whatever you feel, but he's had enough chances. Give yourself the grace and understanding you're offering him, and find your own peace xx", "Hooboy he\u2019s rebounding all over the place. I predict a lot of mess in his future. I\u2019d focus on your siblings and go low contact with dad for now.", "Woooow. Just Wow!!!!! Jesus so much to unpack in his behaviour i dont think i have space in my brain. \n\nIm sorry your dad is just an insensitive jerk wad!", "Family is always a difficult beast to tackle, especially in grief. \n\nKids losing their parents, and parents losing their kids don't get the option of a replacement.. I am not sure your dad understands that pain, so stick with the people who understand what you're going through. \n\nHope it all works out for you.", "Could you and your siblings buy the house?", "I think this says it all, really.", "Fianc\u00e9 is 39 and dad is 62", "Your ability to manage your grief is like any other form of maturity. The older you get the more independently capable you become.", "The timing was unfortunate, but not intentional. \n\nI've grieved my father's death for the past 35 years and my grandfather's for the past 12. I watched my grandfather grieve his son till the day he died (also of cancer). I love them and miss them both terribly.\n\nHowever, I'm a big fan of being able to let things go. Not every small unintentional hurt needs to be brought up. If it's a pattern or if it was deliberate, sure, but everyone is thoughtless occasionally. Except for making your father feel bad what did this achieve? Unless there's more to the story than this isn't a pattern of thoughtless behaviour that needed addressing, he forgot a date.", "I have never heard of DARVO so just googled what it meant. It sounds spot on! That is his typically pattern if he\u2019s ever confronted.", "Thank you. I did think this too if I\u2019m honest: that he\u2019s just replacing our mum with someone else, but that doesn\u2019t work for us or my grandparents.", "No, it\u2019s an incredible house! My mother earned a lot of money while she was alive (how she supported 6 children and a delinquent husband). If my dad needs to sell it we do understand, I would never insist he keeps it purely for our sake if it\u2019s not manageable for him. But we are not as wealthy, even collectively as my mum was. And we don\u2019t really need it, it just would be very sad given the sentimental connection to our mother and her life\u2019s work.", "Hmm yes maybe. Yeah, well there is a pattern of thoughtless or even cruel behaviour from in general, so maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s struck a chord. But yes, maybe he simply just didn\u2019t think about it.", "I may or may not have noticed some similarities with my parental persons, whose go-to is DARVO. Somehow their ridiculous behaviour is supposed to end in me apologising.\n\nIt's exhausting, and I have C-PTSD from it, amongst other things. They don't want to change, and we don't need the stress, so despite the fact that as humans we're designed to want our parents approval/love, sometimes it's easier to go to therapy than to keep banging your head against against the same stubborn jerkface who's supposed to love you.\n\nBesides, they seem perfectly capable of making their own excuses. You don't need to help ;)", "It doesn't have to. People successfully lead parallel lives where you can check in with your dad, without needing to know about his life and vice versa. \n\nMaybe there's balance embracing his ignorance down the road - But I think it's sage to say that time is not now.", "Your grief is your grief and no one can tell you when you should be moving on.\n\nYour dad is showing a serious lack of EQ. Where is the empathy?\n\nHaving said that, I remember someone once saying that a widower remarrying can be seen as a confirmation of a good marriage to his first wife: if he hadn't had a good experience, he wouldn't be quick to enter a another marriage.   For many men, 2 years is a long time.\n\nBut your dad is not being sensitive to any of you who understandably aren't ready to see a new wife and a much younger one at that, on his arm.\n\nI feel foe all of you - your siblings and grandparents.   Maybe your grandparents in particular.  Younger people usually have more of a social life outside family but for your g'parents, their daughter was probably a huge part of their lives. \n\nNTA.", "I understand. What I would do is to enjoy the house as much as possible. If you are able, you could organize a sleepover/party with your siblings and your mom's parents to just have fun in the house and to have the best possible goodbye to the incredible home as a thank you to your mom. Take as many pictures and videos as you can to remember it all. I would film a video and go into each room and share the best memories of your mom you all have. \n\n\n\nAlso, what is your relationship with your dad's fiancee? Is she trying to communicate with you? Do you like her? How are her family and friends treating you?", "You really think he sat there and went \"hmmmm, the anniversary of my wife's death is next week, I want to send a signal to the world by sending out my new wedding invites today\" or do you think he went \"yay, invites are done, I'll drop them at the post box tomorrow\". When you are counting instances that you consider thoughtless or cruel just remember that even if it hurt you doesn't mean it falls into the thoughtless or cruel category. It hurts watching your parent move on, but you are all adults with fully cooked brains. He doesn't need to tiptoe around your grief, especially after 2 years which is actually a pretty long time.\n\nAlso, just as additional info because I'm a family solicitor. Across my career I couldn't count the number of men I've seen die within 12 months of their wife, women however seem to be fine, but so many men completely collapse. I've formed the opinion that in general men are just not good at being alone. No idea why, it's just a trend you notice when you have been in the game for as long as I have.", "He has other anniversaries that you don't even know about. After our mom died, my sister's and I would go to lunch on her death date and to the cemetery. Our dad did not. He had first kiss, first date, first home memories that we did not. I think grief for a parent and grief for a spouse are completely different. Also, I find that as I age, loss becomes less traumatic. Maybe it's the accumulation of many losses. Your father has lost both parents, his wife, probably a sibling or 2, numerous friends, and relatives, and possibly a child. Grief is not new to him.", "Not thinking about it at all is honestly not much better though in my opinion, if, when it does get brought to thier attention, it does not elicit even a tiny modicum of an apology or regret. \n\nI'm sorry to say it, but he doesn't care about your grief, just like he doesn't care about losing your mom and likely only cares about his new partner because she is still shiny and young and new. When that novelty wears off he will treat her just the same as he treated the woman who worked herself to the bone to support his lazy philandering ass- as disposable.\n\n I'm sad for you and your family, I'm sad for your mom that she didn't have a better partner, and I'm even a bit sad that your dad's new partner doesn't realize she should demand better for herself than a man who could act like this.\n\n I think you are way too hard on yourself about possibly dampening your dad's \"joy\" (barf). He's rubbing your nose in it, and it doesn't matter if it wasn't intentional because he's certainly not trying NOT to, nor sorry about it after the fact.\n\nHe's not going to worry about hurting your feelings it seems, so you don't need to stretch yourself so thin out of worry you'll hurt his at your own expense.", "Yes, I think regarding my grandparents that was pretty poor. They lost their child. My grandad is not the same and still, each time we talk about our mum, says \u201cit\u2019s just not right/it\u2019s unnatural/this is the wrong way round\u201d seemingly to himself.", "Yes, we do still regularly meet together with our children in the house, and one brother is living there atm. It\u2019s the house our mother passed away in, she and we didn\u2019t want her to be in the hospital in the last days. But our mother, despite working so hard for all these things, was also very generous and would always try to teach us to not place too much attachment to things. So having our memories is what we should cherish. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 and her family\u2026.well the number of times they\u2019ve been due to join us for family get togethers but left very early or cancelled last minute, or my dad has turned up alone but then left as quick as possible (like an hour or less) with an excuse that they have responsibilities with a pet at home (they no longer have this pet, but the excuses still happen) \u2026.but then have gone on many weekends away to visit her sister a few hours away and regularly see her parents.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve met her parents just one in passing. They seemed nice, but again, it was a passing meeting.", "Ok. To me it feels like yesterday. Not a long time", "Fair enough, he was probably not being deliberately hurtful (and I did acknowledge that I\u2019m my message to him)\n\nBut please don\u2019t start being hurtful and saying I\u2019ve had long enough to grieve. That\u2019s cruel.", "Where did you get that he lost his parents or siblings?", "People will seriously say anything on reddit to excuse men for thier crappy behavior, I swear \ud83d\ude44", "I'm really sorry, OP.  I'm glad you have each other for support in your grief.\n\nHugs.", "Thank you \u2728"]}
