Only you can answer that.\n\nMaybe she has other options \u2013 she must know other people. Maybe she doesn't.

There's posts all the time of 'my ex/friend/bestie/brother/SIL/MIL/whatever came to stay with me for a few days and it's been 6 months and they are trashing my place AITA for kicking them out?'.  \n\nSo if you let her in, I wouldn't do so until/unless there is a clear end date for her stay and an understood path for her to move out.

But my sister is trans, and unfortunately I have seen people bow to their transphobic family members and cut her out. I think if that's what happened his reaction makes sense.", "I'd get details.  \nI'll say she sounds a bit nutty to begin with.  Thus the caution.  \n\nAn 'altercation' could mean his intolerant family found out she was trans and told her to 'get that man out of the house or we won't talk to you again' or some such crap and that led to an incident.  \n\nOr it could mean she started something and they told him to get rid of her.  \n\nEither way it doesn't say good things about him that he let his family order someone out of his life.  But if she did something nutty it may be the right call.  \n\nBasically until you figure out if it's her fault or not, hard to make a decision.", "Don\u2019t let guilt manipulate you into helping her.

Well, sounds like he did the right thing!\n\nI'm glad she had supportive people, emphasis on had, because it sounds like she's not going to have anyone left if this is the way she keeps behaving. This may sound cruel, but you might just need to let her hit rock-bottom. If she doesn't have people to keep bailing her out, eventually she'll have to get her shit together.
