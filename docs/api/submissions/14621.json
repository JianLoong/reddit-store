She has really long hair and sheds everywhere while I have short hair. \n\nWe used to have a problem with the shower getting clogged with hair and I kept having to ask her to clean it which she did but she would complain about finding poop in it as she picked out the hair. Where I grew up, it is considered unclean to use toilet paper and toilets have a handheld mini shower we call a shatafa and use to spray clean our bums. I am not religious and this is not a religion thing, I just find the thought of smearing poop around to clean it disgusting as some of it probably adheres to the skin.\n\nSo after I poop, I clean up in the shower. The only reason poop got stuck in the drain is because her hair had clogged it there, otherwise it would have gone through.\n\nRecently she got a drain cover to make it easier to clean, the drain cover holds her hair but the problem is it also collects poop chunks. She wants both of us to clean the drain cover after use, however I think this is unfair as the drain cover is only there because of her shedding problem and without it or her hair there would be no issues. I don't see how it is fair and besides if both of us have to clean it everytime, we use the shower so frequently that it would make no difference if just she did it.\n\nShe didn't say anything when I explained this but she has been acting cold towards me since when we normally get along very well and do things together all the time.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s like $30, hurts for about 5 minutes during, and then it\u2019s almost no worries till it starts getting long again. The only thing you do have to watch out for is ingrown hairs.

I'm so happy for you both. :-)\n\nIf you find that it is uncomfortable to shave, you can also have your nethers waxed. It sounds painful, but when a professional does it, it really isn't. Also, it lasts longer and the grow out is soft. Another option is that when you shave, you don't shave to the skin but give it a very short \"haircut\" instead.\n\nYou can also get a bidet attachment to your toilet. It's easy to install, and that might eliminate the need to shave. We put one on our toilet, and it's just so *clean*! I have a stack of cloths (they're actually old cloth diapers) near the toilet to dry off, and wash those separately.\n\nBest of all though, it sounds like you have really moved in a great direction overall!

He's never understood he's not a toddler, and she's not his Mummy - but that's entered atrocious new chapters (involving his hygiene), in recent years. Yes, she should leave him - and says she would, if she could afford it. I would NOT suggest that you read the following, if any of the above has been too much for you. How we've not had a complete nervous breakdown, I don't know. \n\nSo he started leaving marks all over the toilet. It was 'too difficult' now he was 'getting older' to clean them up (he was about 63 when that started) - even though he'd happily go trotting off to the shops to buy/carry alcohol, would still go engaging in hobbies like gliding, etc. That graduated to leaving shit marks all over their bed, when he sat on it to get changed. I don't even want to think what his laundry was like (which my Mum always had to do, of course).\n\nThere were numerous fights and near-murder over all that. But then things hit new depths, almost to unspeakable levels. He started getting constipated regularly (again, his own damn fault from a poor diet - it was investigated). He'd hog the one bathroom for literally hours, trying to force it (nobody else could POSSIBLY have the right to urinate in the meantime. His damn bowels HAD to be the priority). \n\nThe details are horrendous, but he'd take the wrong type of laxative - and he'd then manage to get fecal liquid all over the seat, even if he couldn't get out what he actually needed.  He'd also often leave shitty fingerprints on the toilet paper, the basin, and his clothes. Then despite further threats of murder and divorce, he'd instead roll around on his bed (for some reason half-undressed, getting shit marks all over the bed again), demanding an ambulance (seriously \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). It seems his further justification for not cleaning up after himself, was just how much 'pain' Diddums was in, from a bit of (self-inflicted) constipation.\n\nThen came 'That Day'. The day that resulted in my Mum (who doesn't swear) effing and blinding like a trooper, screaming and crying, and chucking bottles of cleaning fluid full-force at him (yes, there were deserved bruises on him). He again hogged the bathroom for hours. And at some point, the laxatives gave him explosive diarrhoea. \n\nThis didn't just end up on the toilet seat this time, oh no. It somehow managed to dribble down his leg, onto his foot. A normal person would be straight in the shower. Not this plonker. So yes - you can imagine what happened. My poor Mum went racing into the bathroom, to finally get to pee - and there was the usual horrendous mess. Then to her horror, she realised she was standing in it as well. \n\nAnd she followed the footprints - allllll the way along the hallway carpet, into the bedroom (also carpeted). Where Big Baby was nursing his sore tummy-wummy again - covered in his own shit, rolling around half-naked on the clean bed covers (yet again). \n\nI seriously think the police would have understood if she'd killed him. The diarrhoea stains he trailed everywhere wouldn't come off the carpets (guess who had to try to remove them? Meanwhile, he just dismissively told her not to try to clean them, as they would 'wear' out of the carpets). So all the carpets had to be replaced. And to top it all off, HE accused HER of 'not understanding'. I swear that if there's a hell, my Dad will be employed there one day as a chief torturer. He's certainly going there himself.", "What culture is that ???? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 Hate it when filthy, unhygienic personal habits are blamed on \" culture\".
