It\u2019s frankly none of their business what she does and if she decides one day she\u2019s comfortable with telling them, then she will do that on her own terms.\n\nIm not sure why so many people are under the impression that OP was the one who created the video, but it\u2019s very explicitly mentioned that a relative filmed them unknowingly and either cut out the part about her being a sex worker on their own, or simply arrived after it had already been said and seen them yelling at eachother.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s in the United States, though there\u2019s a decent chance, and regardless not all sex workers are comfortable with prostitution. All we know is she does pornography, and there\u2019s nothing else that suggests otherwise, so simply assuming she\u2019s doing illegal sex work just because she makes porn is just weird.", "You friend is an AH and it was not her story to tell. My two cents, don't trust her with information you don't want everyone to know and if you are ashamed to tell people you work in porn, you might want to consider a different career so, to a certain extent, you are not totally blameless here.

Itsnot a big deal\u2026", "Wow. \\*drinks coffee\\* \\*cracks knuckles\\*\n\nFirst, your initial reasons for being upset with Jenna are valid. She betrayed your trust by discussing your racy line of work at a public event with family and a variety of personalities present. Whether you communicated that your line of work is a private matter, shared only with friends in confidence, or not is worth reflecting on. Really though, Jenna should have read the room. It's incredibly inappropriate to make gags at someone's expense regarding situations that everybody might have a varying degree of comfortability with, or who's moral compass may point in different directions. Additionally, it's *your* fundraiser right? You're the organizer and - from the sounds of it - MC? It's pretty awful for a friend to undermine your hard work and moment in the spotlight.\n\nNow that being said, the situation begs you to honestly reflect on how you responded to Jenna. Did you pull her aside to a private area and speak in hushed tones about her actions and your feelings? Or was it a scene? The fact that there is a recording of the confrontation makes me think that you weren't as calm and relaxed as the OP suggests. What is the \"back and forth\" that was omitted here, and how would it look to an observer? My gut tells me that you were lashing out in rage, so much so that someone thought it would be important to document the confrontation.\n\nThe next question is who is your circle and why are they sharing the recording? If it's a smaller, intimate group of friend's, that's an incredibly immature thing to do when people they care about are at each other's throats. If it's a larger group of say, loosely associated people who text to meet up and go drinking, I would be asking if these people are really your friends and if it's worth staying in that group. The fact that it was shared and spread indicates that these people want you to fail. They don't care about your stability or happiness and would rather find ways to stir the pot than see you succeed.\n\nAnyway those are just my thoughts...
