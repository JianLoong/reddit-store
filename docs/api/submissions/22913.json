Pulling her aside, asking what the hell, saying that it wasn't her info to share, and asking her to leave was great. But when she didn't leave, you should have immediately called security and had her escorted out instead of engaging in an argument and saying stuff about her boyfriend.\n\n3) Whoever recorded and shared your argument online for sh\\*ts and giggles.
