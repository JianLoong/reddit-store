As soon as this chick started railing, OP should have just called security and had her out. Don't get me wrong, it'd be hard AF to step back when someone who claimed to be your friend was insulting you and betraying you like that, but it was the fundraiser she organized, so it really makes her look bad to be recorded at her event talking trash about someone else's relationship in what seems to be a loud, public argument.", "Tits* ftfy", "Everyone sucks here = \u201cyou\u2019re all assholes\u201d", "A lot of sex work is illegal, though. In addition, OP is obviously not proud of her work.", "Agree completely", "ohh okay i figured it meant something like everybody is the asshole haha, thanks!", "OP never said they weren\u2019t proud of their work, so I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re assuming that. Going off the details in the post, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s comfortable enough with it if she\u2019s talking about it openly with her friends.\n\nIm not sure why she needs to tell everyone in her family about her career in order to be proud of it.\n\nAlso your comment about a majority of sex work being illegal was completely irrelevant, since OP does pornography, which is completely legal. Even then, only street prostitution is illegal, though there are some countries that allow it. Prostitution in licensed brothels is legal in several countries.", "If you cannot tell your family what you do, you are not proud of your work. If you create a video abd share it around but cut out the part mentioning your job, you are not proud of your work. Sorry not sorry. Facts not feelings. \n\nProstitution is illegal in 49 of the 50 states, and we do not know if porn is all OP does, which if reading biographies of former adult film stars is never the case.", "There are some things that people would rather not have their family know about. It\u2019s perfectly fine for her to want her career to be private, and I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re so hooked on the idea of being \u2018proud\u2019 of your work. It\u2019s frankly none of their business what she does and if she decides one day she\u2019s comfortable with telling them, then she will do that on her own terms.\n\nIm not sure why so many people are under the impression that OP was the one who created the video, but it\u2019s very explicitly mentioned that a relative filmed them unknowingly and either cut out the part about her being a sex worker on their own, or simply arrived after it had already been said and seen them yelling at eachother.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s in the United States, though there\u2019s a decent chance, and regardless not all sex workers are comfortable with prostitution. All we know is she does pornography, and there\u2019s nothing else that suggests otherwise, so simply assuming she\u2019s doing illegal sex work just because she makes porn is just weird."]}
