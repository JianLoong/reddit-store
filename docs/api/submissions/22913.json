It\u2019s frankly none of their business what she does and if she decides one day she\u2019s comfortable with telling them, then she will do that on her own terms.\n\nIm not sure why so many people are under the impression that OP was the one who created the video, but it\u2019s very explicitly mentioned that a relative filmed them unknowingly and either cut out the part about her being a sex worker on their own, or simply arrived after it had already been said and seen them yelling at eachother.\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s in the United States, though there\u2019s a decent chance, and regardless not all sex workers are comfortable with prostitution. All we know is she does pornography, and there\u2019s nothing else that suggests otherwise, so simply assuming she\u2019s doing illegal sex work just because she makes porn is just weird.", "You friend is an AH and it was not her story to tell. My two cents, don't trust her with information you don't want everyone to know and if you are ashamed to tell people you work in porn, you might want to consider a different career so, to a certain extent, you are not totally blameless here.

But she's a gargantuan one.", "The person who filmed and then shared the clip is the AH here. \nArguments/discussions from friends shouldn't be recorded.", "NTA.

Mind the business that pays you.", "NTA.  You're right, it's not her secret to share.", "NTA, what\u2019s the @?\ud83d\ude02", "Nta. Itsnot a big deal\u2026", "Wow. \\*drinks coffee\\* \\*cracks knuckles\\*\n\nFirst, your initial reasons for being upset with Jenna are valid. She betrayed your trust by discussing your racy line of work at a public event with family and a variety of personalities present. Whether you communicated that your line of work is a private matter, shared only with friends in confidence, or not is worth reflecting on. Really though, Jenna should have read the room. It's incredibly inappropriate to make gags at someone's expense regarding situations that everybody might have a varying degree of comfortability with, or who's moral compass may point in different directions. Additionally, it's *your* fundraiser right? You're the organizer and - from the sounds of it - MC? It's pretty awful for a friend to undermine your hard work and moment in the spotlight.\n\nNow that being said, the situation begs you to honestly reflect on how you responded to Jenna. Did you pull her aside to a private area and speak in hushed tones about her actions and your feelings? Or was it a scene? The fact that there is a recording of the confrontation makes me think that you weren't as calm and relaxed as the OP suggests. What is the \"back and forth\" that was omitted here, and how would it look to an observer? My gut tells me that you were lashing out in rage, so much so that someone thought it would be important to document the confrontation.\n\nThe next question is who is your circle and why are they sharing the recording? If it's a smaller, intimate group of friend's, that's an incredibly immature thing to do when people they care about are at each other's throats. If it's a larger group of say, loosely associated people who text to meet up and go drinking, I would be asking if these people are really your friends and if it's worth staying in that group. The fact that it was shared and spread indicates that these people want you to fail. They don't care about your stability or happiness and would rather find ways to stir the pot than see you succeed.\n\nAnyway those are just my thoughts...

Getting her removed for sharing your business is very sensible.", "As a friend of many sex workers: NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" was being a jackass", "Nta, fuck around and find out is what it felt like!

Your friend should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut.. couple of questions tho, how did your phone magically record that conversation? my phone has never done that and also how did all your friends see it?

You didn\u2019t humiliate your friend, she humiliated herself.", "NTA, Jenna sounds toxic , she knew exactly what she was doing, If she is the type to use someone for their money , then she was trying to take you down in front of people on purpose ,most likely because you were getting attention for donating and doing this fund raiser. What's worse is she doesn't respect you or sex work if that's her attitude. Although I would have told her exactly what she told you, it's not a big deal that you are only using a partner for their money .

Obviously she was an AH, but you responded in kind.  Having her escorted out: appropriate.

Apparently it's totally OK to serial date and have boyfriends supply you with gifts and lifestyle in exchange for your body, but it's not OK to just skip the games and go straight to the business. I find sex work a lot less damaging than the other sorts of behaviors that society finds more acceptable.\n\nLike there's an entire accepted lifestyle of being a trophy wife or marrying someone older and being a sugar baby. How are any of those better than just making porn or selling sex?\n\nI don't get it. I never have. As a guy it's all the same thing to me and the fact you're not manipulating people's emotions makes one less damaging than the other.", "You missed it she is ESH because she fucked the boyfriend over by announcing his relationship to the world as a sham.

That is mega toxic , especially if it's something that 1 doesn't involve you and 2 is something that's personal to those people.

There is a reason she isn't open about it with strangers and her family, and she deserves to have that respected.

It isn't as simple as just quitting because someone bullied you for it or you feel embarrassed. If that were the case, then we wouldn't have any fast food workers. Even if she *was* proud of it, that doesn't give her friend the right to say that. Sex work is still very heavily stigmatized, and hearing that someone does it can completely alter another person's perception of it.", "Her ex friend outed her deliberately to a group of people at the fundraiser.

And  then sites like only fans. And a lot sex workers have huge  a social media presence.

I mention pride because when the other poster mentioned self-incriminating, even though it may not be illegal, if you are ashamed of something, you will go to great lengths to cover it up. \n\nIt was actually never mentioned a relative created the video. You made up that narrative and ran with it. She stated the \"argument had got created,\" and the passive nature of this statement and the fact the parts that revealed information she did not want out-self incriminating-were not there greatly suggests she was the one who recorded it. Or at least edited and circulated it. \n\nYou are right about the States. From OP's profile, she lives in the UK, where sex work is legal. I stated about the illegality from an American standpoint, as a lot of sex workers are involved in illegal activities. Unfortunately, I have known quite a few sex workers, even was roommates with one, and every single one of them was  involved in something illegal. That is just the nature of the beast here.", "Okay, let\u2019s go with the assumption she is \u2018ashamed\u2019. There\u2019s no point in mentioning that since it\u2019s completely irrelevant. It should matter whether or not she\u2019s proud of her career because it literally makes no difference to the incident.\n\nThe reason I assumed it was likely a relative was because the majority of the guests were close friends or relatives, though it could\u2019ve been any one of the guests. I\u2019m not sure what exactly suggests she was the one who recorded it since it was pretty clear that she only found out about the video after the event when it was being shared around their circle. If it was made by a guest at the wedding and was being shared around their circle, the video was likely made by a relative or close friend who had access to her circle\u2019s contact information and either sent it to them privately or to a family group chat."]}
