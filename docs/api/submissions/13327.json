She\u2019s also very angry at me because I just go on my run and then go to work, and she said why should you get such a luxury while I dont?\n\nI then responded that first off, they\u2019re not my kids, and I didn\u2019t choose to have kids, you did, so you need to own the responsibility for your own kids. I will admit that was a brutally honest thing to say, but I\u2019ve been doing this habit since before either of the kids were born and way before I even met her, it\u2019s literally a part of me, and I think my wife is being incredibly rude for suggesting me to drastically change my life.

As their step parent who lives with them, they ARE your children now. The attitude you expressed will not win you any points with your wife.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you wanting to run at 5 am. The issue is all of you co-sleeping. It is unsustainable and will hurt your marriage in the long run, as it has already caused this major issue. Your wife could possibly stay with the five year old until he falls back asleep or find other ways to deal with his nightmares. Children should be sleeping independently so that you and your wife can sleep like spouses instead of roommates. \n\nAdmit you were a thoughtless dumbass who said that out of frustration and work together to get the kids sleeping in their own beds without incident.", "Damn bro, only one year in, and you dropped those ain't my damn kids line lmao. That is brutal and funny at the same time. Here is the key to marriage: comprimse! Talk to your wife and figure out a plan. Sleep on the couch on days you need to run so you can sneak out. Get your kid some help to overcome the nightmares. Let your wife try running in the morning since she wants to have that luxury. Listen, your life before marriage is important and by all means you need to do things that keep you sane BUT your marriage won't last much longer if you don't switch to the \"we\" mentality and drop the \"me\" mentality. Sacrifice is a huge part of being a father and husband. You have a responsibility to 4 people, and they are looking to you for stability. Talk to your wife, I am confident she understands how important running is to you and together you'll find a solution.

These poor kids deserve way better than this.\n\nSecondly, why can't you just change the time that you take your walks?

She\u2019s also very angry at me because I just go on my run and then go to work, and she said why should you get such a luxury while I dont?\n\nI then responded that first off, they\u2019re not my kids, and I didn\u2019t choose to have kids, you did, so you need to own the responsibility for your own kids.
