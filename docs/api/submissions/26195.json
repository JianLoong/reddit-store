She doesn\u2019t care about the noises a toddler makes and you do. You couldn\u2019t come to an agreement.

I wouldn\u2019t want to be near a screaming baby, either. You have choices and you made one.", "NAH. It\u2019s fine if you didn\u2019t want to sit there. It\u2019s fine that she didn\u2019t want to move. \n\nAnd it was a toddler, not a baby. Babies don\u2019t eat mac and cheese. \n\nFor the record, babies and toddlers - like all other people - make noise.", "If she was enjoying being in the babies presence and wished to stay - that doesn\u2019t make her an asshole, you left because you\u2019d find more enjoyment elsewhere that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole either. Babies and toddlers make noise, especially in a busy environment like that - you would still hear them even if you switched seats. NAH just difference of enjoyment. You are pushing it by saying babies shouldn\u2019t be there, that\u2019s absolutely not your call and it seems that it\u2019s a family friendly place not an adult only. I would recommend going to an actual bar or other adult only venues in future instead to avoid this.", "A lot of breweries can be family friendly. Most of the ones in my town are. Also people in general make noise. Not just babies.", "NTA. Not everyone wants to hear a baby. I\u2019m one of those people and I would have left as well.", "NAH\n\nYou each had different baby sound tolerance.", "NTA - you were seated near to something that bothered you, you wanted to move to where the auditory environment would be more pleading to you. You didn't try to have the kid and their designate care giver removed, or make rude comments to them, you wanted to remove YOURSELF from the immediate vicinity. It was a small enough request to make of your friend", "NTA op, I wonder if she'd share the same sentiment on a 12hr+ flight, she pretty much downplayed your feelings,  like she didn't take your seriously", "NTA, what irresponsible, selfish parents bring a baby to a place with alcohol? People shouldn\u2019t have to be bothered your babies just because you chose to have them.", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t want to be near a screaming baby. Don\u2019t know why your friend would, but I\u2019d probably leave.", "NTA.  Seems like such a low-key request to move away from a baby making loud happy noises.  Plus you were there for Happy Hour and I could see how that might kill the vibe.\n\nDon't blame you for leaving.", "YTA\n\nclearly it was a family-friendly brewery (most brewery\u2019s are anyways) and not a bar, so why would you say a toddler isn\u2019t allowed to be there? very odd.\n\nit just sounds like you really dislike young children, which of course everyone has their own preferences but that should also mean you understand some people DO like children lol. clearly your friend didnt want to get up and move over a happy toddler, i mean it\u2019s going to be loud anywhere there\u2019s drunk people, so why is it that big of a deal? i guess that\u2019s just how i see it though. \n\ni think getting up and leaving was a little childish, especially since you were probably just butthurt that she doesn\u2019t share the same dislike for children that you do. But again, that\u2019s my opinion and what I\u2019m getting from this post.", "YTA - there was no screaming baby in your story. There was simply a baby babbling. Your tolerance levels are ridiculously low. Your friend should have just moved tables it\u2019s not a big deal but you up and leaving is weird and if I had been your friend I would probably never make plans with you again and would think you were nuts.", "NTA you asked her nicely to move away from something that irritated you & she refused. IMO regardless of what the source of the irritation is, when one\u2019s date asks to move away from it, one should simply do that. No one should have to be unnecessarily irritated while out trying to enjoy their time with a date.", "NAH this seems like it\u2019s more about you and your friend not being understanding of one another than the baby issue. I will say you are a bit of an AH for your comment that the baby \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d. That\u2019s just flat out wrong. People have babies. Those people like to go out. The baby wasn\u2019t crying nonstop, it was eating and making sounds. When I go out and there are people talking loudly, or cursing a lot, or laughing obnoxiously, I don\u2019t get to say they \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d. I can move tables if it really bothers me, but I can also deal with it because I\u2019m in a public space. Now if someone is throwing a fit, ceying, screaming - regardless of age - yeah, they should probably leave until they can calm down. All I\u2019m saying is there is a difference between disturbing the peace and others, and just existing in a space. Call your friend, have a talk. NAH, especially not the mac and cheese loving baby ;-)", "NTA. And, if she had changed tables, I'm sure she still could have heard the \"cute\" kid.", "NTA I often ask to move tables even if I\u2019m just around a bunch of kids who are being loud and obnoxious. I get easily overstimulated by noise, and \u201cloud background noise\u201d is a lot different than \u201crandom kids/toddlers screaming\u201d noise. Recently I did this when I was at an upscale-ish pizza place and a kids baseball team came in and was seated next to me and my friend. (We tipped generously.) \n\nAlso: I think your friend dismissing your desire to be away from the noise is kind of a d*ck move. Friends should generally be amenable to and sensitive toward their friends\u2019 needs, not brushing them off or telling them it\u2019s no big deal.", "YTA- you don\u2019t like babies making any noises? What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Nta.\nI would have done the same.", "Yta, get a grip.", "NTA\n\nBack in my day you had to be 21 to get into a bar. Now get off my goddamn lawn!", "NTA. You weren't comfortable; you left. No problem.", "Sorry but YTA, breweries near me (NYC) are baby central. Go to a bar and not a relaxed outdoor family-friendly space.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s just a baby for Christ\u2019s sake. Babies make noise.\n\nIs it always fun to listen to? No. Should parents with babies be forced to stay away from public spaces. Absolutely not.\n\nBabies and children- noisy or otherwise- belong in shared spaces.", "YTA, mostly for \u201cexpressing that babies shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d It\u2019s a brewery, not a bar. Almost all breweries I\u2019ve ever seen are family friendly.", "NTA - I don't like to sit near babies or toddlers making noise either. Since this mattered to you but didn't matter to her, I can't understand why she couldn't just move.", "If you don't want to be near babies making noise, why go to a place to drink that doesn't have an age requirement?", "NAH. Just wondering why you couldn\u2019t work out some compromise with your friend. Adults can be loud too, not just toddlers and babies.", "You just left left? Couldn't just get another table and move on? Me and my gf sat beside a baby at a pub once, it annoyed me and I'm a mom.", "NTA. not like you told the parents to make their baby shut the hell up (which would be pretty rude) you just acted like an adult and said hey let's just move. You're definitely not an asshole here.", "YTA .. Breweries that have restaurants and serve food, are for families too. They are not meant to be bars. If you don\u2019t want children around, don\u2019t go to a restaurant. Go to a club or a bar.", "NTA. If someone if uncomfortable the \u2018party\u2019 moves to make sure everyone is at at least a basic comfort level.", "The absence of a loud baby wasn\u2019t going to ruin your friends night, but the presence of it would ruin yours. I\u2019m of the belief that if someone is bothered by something it overrides someone enjoying / not caring about something. She should have moved for you. \n\nNTA", "Ummm even happy babies can shriek or screech at uncomfortable pitches. NTA", "NTA.  If they were other seats, and it wasn\u2019t inconvenient to move, then your friend should\u2019ve accommodated you.\n\nReminds me of a situation years ago, when my eldest son was an infant and still in a car seat. I was out to lunch at an outdoor table with his mom, her mom and dad and I think her brother or something. There were quite a few people. \n\nShe had our son kind of in the walkway. Where waitresses and stuff are going back-and-forth. It\u2019s not like they had to step over him, but their feet were walking close. If they were to drop something, it could\u2019ve injured him. \n\nI asked her to move him and she refused. She said it was unnecessary. She didn\u2019t say that she was too tired to move him or that there was no place to out him (there was) or anything like that. She just didn\u2019t afeel it was necessary to move him. We argued back-and-forth until she moved him. But yeah, some people can be mulish like that.", "NTA! Why are parents bringing their kids to a bar? Irresponsible af on their end.", "NTA. Omfg I wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to a *screaming* baby either. It\u2019s not about a little noise or a baby it\u2019s about a screaming infant hahahah.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to want to move to another table. You were both there for happy hour, not to watch a \u201chappy baby make noises\u201d", "NTA, babies obviously deserve to be in public and be babies but you\u2019re not under any obligation to subject yourself to whatever comes with it, and if your friend isn\u2019t willing to accommodate that then i would have left too. You did nothing wrong", "NTA. Babies don't belong at breweries.", "Listen, I\u2019ve got two grown kids but I wouldn\u2019t want to be near a yelling, crying screaming baby either. If your friend is that insensitive to your request, you were right to leave. NTA", "Nta\nI have two kids 3 years old and 4 months\nMy wife and I refuse to put ourselves into situations where we are going to be annoying people\nIts common courtesy\nKids can be annoying and they are not for everyone.", "NTA. Your request was reasonable. You didn't say anything to the kid or parents. Your friend probably plans to have kids someday and was upset when you made your distaste for toddler noises clear.", "NAH. I've no problem with the baby being there, but OP is entitled to not want to sit next to it. OP's friend is entitled to like babies. This just seems like a difference of opinion about whether a baby in this venue was annoying - that seems like a topic people can have different views on, don't think it makes any of them TA.", "NAH. Sensory overload is a real thing. I'll excuse myself if I can't deal. I carry earplugs, but that is more for when I'm alone. Instead of saying you don't like baby noises, say the loud noise is overwhelming you and you need to move.", "NTA \n\nCertain types of noise can be really uncomfortable for some people. Sometimes it just depends on the day you have had and what your energy is like. You tried to solve the problem by moving and your friend thought you should somehow force yourself to enjoy a noise that you found really jarring? She might have a different version of events but she can't blame you for choosing to leave. What else could you do?  \n\n\nI have occasionally been into family friendly gastropubs and asked if we could be seated away from noisy families. Of course kids are allowed to be in appropriate spaces. Adults who don't have kids are also allowed to try their best to avoid them.", "I'm not a fan of either screaming or babbling babies as well. Especially at a brewery.   NTA", "Wish there were adults only sections at bars.", "The fact that OPs friend knew OP was uncomfortable, \n and friend didn't care makes the friend the ah.

We have 4 kids (all adults now) I wouldn\u2019t want to see a baby at happy hour.  If you\u2019re in a touristy area or it\u2019s a regular restaurant with a brewery, it definitely happens.  I get that everyone is the cool Dad now, but it\u2019s still a bar.  Common sense says go somewhere else, sit in the way back or go at 11:00am for a burger.  I\u2019ve had to wait for a table on a Friday night in the bar area,  because parents are hogging all the real estate with 9 year old little league kids. WTH", "NTA. When a friend disregards your preferences like this it is friendship ruining, even if it is a relatively minor thing it signals they are not willing to compromise (for a minor thing). Like do these people not care about their friends??

And it\u2019s also fine that your friend didn\u2019t want to move.\n\nHowever, for just picking up and leaving I\u2019d say YTA. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know why, but I feel like the baby wasn\u2019t really shouting, and simply their presence was enough to annoy you.", "I don\u2019t usually comment on these as I think people are generally too judgemental and puritanical, there\u2019s two sides to every story, nor do I have an opinion on whether you\u2019re an AH as there\u2019s not much info here either way.\n\nI just want to send out a general request to people to STOP constantly judging and shaming parents for bringing their children into public places and complaining about children existing. Do you think you were all perfect kids who never made a sound? Would you like all parents to forego a social life and stick to their homes and designated play areas so you don\u2019t have your perfect silence tarnished by a giggling toddler?\n\nAll I seem to hear about these days is the untouchable sanctity of child-free weddings or disgust at parents daring to bring their kids into public transport or into restaurants. Then the same people will complain about kids being given phones and iPads to shut them up so you don\u2019t sit there tutting and sighing and sending judgemental looks. Each to their own, but at least accept that not everyone and everything can exist purely for your comfort.", "NTA. Your friends response should have been \"okay, let's move over there.\" She was being rude for not respecting your boundaries. That said, if babies/toddlers aren't outright banned (ie the place isn't advertised as 18+ only), then babies belong there and you need to accept that there's a possibility you'll come across them. Children and parents are part of society and have every right to participate in society just the same as everyone else.", "NTA You can choose to not be around a noisy baby.  A baby of any kind at happy hour seems a bit odd anyway.  Leaving was the choice for you.", "Scariest and most annoying noise in the world is a loud child.

There wasn't even a screaming baby in this scenario.", "Everything was fine until this comment: \n\n> I expressed that babies shouldn\u2019t be there. \n\nThat\u2019s not for you to decide. You can be disturbed by the noise, you can express wanting to sit further away, all good. I even think that your friend should\u2019ve just agreed to move, seeing that you were bothered.

I physically cant listen to baby/toddler sounds, and I understand the need to move away from it if it bothers you.
