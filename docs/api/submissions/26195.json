She doesn\u2019t care about the noises a toddler makes and you do. You couldn\u2019t come to an agreement.

It\u2019s fine that she didn\u2019t want to move. \n\nAnd it was a toddler, not a baby. Babies don\u2019t eat mac and cheese. \n\nFor the record, babies and toddlers - like all other people - make noise.", "If she was enjoying being in the babies presence and wished to stay - that doesn\u2019t make her an asshole, you left because you\u2019d find more enjoyment elsewhere that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole either. Babies and toddlers make noise, especially in a busy environment like that - you would still hear them even if you switched seats. NAH just difference of enjoyment. You are pushing it by saying babies shouldn\u2019t be there, that\u2019s absolutely not your call and it seems that it\u2019s a family friendly place not an adult only. I would recommend going to an actual bar or other adult only venues in future instead to avoid this.", "A lot of breweries can be family friendly. Most of the ones in my town are. Also people in general make noise. Not just babies.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nYou each had different baby sound tolerance.", "NTA - you were seated near to something that bothered you, you wanted to move to where the auditory environment would be more pleading to you. You didn't try to have the kid and their designate care giver removed, or make rude comments to them, you wanted to remove YOURSELF from the immediate vicinity. It was a small enough request to make of your friend", "NTA op, I wonder if she'd share the same sentiment on a 12hr+ flight, she pretty much downplayed your feelings,  like she didn't take your seriously", "NTA, what irresponsible, selfish parents bring a baby to a place with alcohol? People shouldn\u2019t have to be bothered your babies just because you chose to have them.", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t want to be near a screaming baby. Don\u2019t know why your friend would, but I\u2019d probably leave.", "NTA.  Seems like such a low-key request to move away from a baby making loud happy noises.  Plus you were there for Happy Hour and I could see how that might kill the vibe.\n\nDon't blame you for leaving.", "YTA\n\nclearly it was a family-friendly brewery (most brewery\u2019s are anyways) and not a bar, so why would you say a toddler isn\u2019t allowed to be there? very odd.\n\nit just sounds like you really dislike young children, which of course everyone has their own preferences but that should also mean you understand some people DO like children lol. clearly your friend didnt want to get up and move over a happy toddler, i mean it\u2019s going to be loud anywhere there\u2019s drunk people, so why is it that big of a deal? i guess that\u2019s just how i see it though. \n\ni think getting up and leaving was a little childish, especially since you were probably just butthurt that she doesn\u2019t share the same dislike for children that you do. But again, that\u2019s my opinion and what I\u2019m getting from this post.", "YTA - there was no screaming baby in your story. There was simply a baby babbling. Your tolerance levels are ridiculously low. Your friend should have just moved tables it\u2019s not a big deal but you up and leaving is weird and if I had been your friend I would probably never make plans with you again and would think you were nuts.", "NTA you asked her nicely to move away from something that irritated you & she refused. IMO regardless of what the source of the irritation is, when one\u2019s date asks to move away from it, one should simply do that. No one should have to be unnecessarily irritated while out trying to enjoy their time with a date.", "NAH this seems like it\u2019s more about you and your friend not being understanding of one another than the baby issue. I will say you are a bit of an AH for your comment that the baby \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d. That\u2019s just flat out wrong. People have babies. Those people like to go out. The baby wasn\u2019t crying nonstop, it was eating and making sounds. When I go out and there are people talking loudly, or cursing a lot, or laughing obnoxiously, I don\u2019t get to say they \u201cshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d. I can move tables if it really bothers me, but I can also deal with it because I\u2019m in a public space. Now if someone is throwing a fit, ceying, screaming - regardless of age - yeah, they should probably leave until they can calm down. All I\u2019m saying is there is a difference between disturbing the peace and others, and just existing in a space. Call your friend, have a talk. NAH, especially not the mac and cheese loving baby ;-)", "NTA. And, if she had changed tables, I'm sure she still could have heard the \"cute\" kid.", "NTA I often ask to move tables even if I\u2019m just around a bunch of kids who are being loud and obnoxious. I get easily overstimulated by noise, and \u201cloud background noise\u201d is a lot different than \u201crandom kids/toddlers screaming\u201d noise. Recently I did this when I was at an upscale-ish pizza place and a kids baseball team came in and was seated next to me and my friend. (We tipped generously.) \n\nAlso: I think your friend dismissing your desire to be away from the noise is kind of a d*ck move. Friends should generally be amenable to and sensitive toward their friends\u2019 needs, not brushing them off or telling them it\u2019s no big deal.", "YTA- you don\u2019t like babies making any noises?

Go to a bar and not a relaxed outdoor family-friendly space.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s just a baby for Christ\u2019s sake. Babies make noise.\n\nIs it always fun to listen to? No. Should parents with babies be forced to stay away from public spaces. Absolutely not.\n\nBabies and children- noisy or otherwise- belong in shared spaces.", "YTA, mostly for \u201cexpressing that babies shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d It\u2019s a brewery, not a bar. Almost all breweries I\u2019ve ever seen are family friendly.", "NTA - I don't like to sit near babies or toddlers making noise either. Since this mattered to you but didn't matter to her, I can't understand why she couldn't just move.", "If you don't want to be near babies making noise, why go to a place to drink that doesn't have an age requirement?", "NAH. Just wondering why you couldn\u2019t work out some compromise with your friend. Adults can be loud too, not just toddlers and babies.", "You just left left? Couldn't just get another table and move on? Me and my gf sat beside a baby at a pub once, it annoyed me and I'm a mom.", "NTA. not like you told the parents to make their baby shut the hell up (which would be pretty rude) you just acted like an adult and said hey let's just move. You're definitely not an asshole here.", "YTA .. Breweries that have restaurants and serve food, are for families too. They are not meant to be bars. If you don\u2019t want children around, don\u2019t go to a restaurant. Go to a club or a bar.", "NTA. If someone if uncomfortable the \u2018party\u2019 moves to make sure everyone is at at least a basic comfort level.", "The absence of a loud baby wasn\u2019t going to ruin your friends night, but the presence of it would ruin yours. I\u2019m of the belief that if someone is bothered by something it overrides someone enjoying / not caring about something. She should have moved for you. \n\nNTA", "Ummm even happy babies can shriek or screech at uncomfortable pitches. NTA", "NTA.  If they were other seats, and it wasn\u2019t inconvenient to move, then your friend should\u2019ve accommodated you.\n\nReminds me of a situation years ago, when my eldest son was an infant and still in a car seat. I was out to lunch at an outdoor table with his mom, her mom and dad and I think her brother or something. There were quite a few people. \n\nShe had our son kind of in the walkway. Where waitresses and stuff are going back-and-forth. It\u2019s not like they had to step over him, but their feet were walking close. If they were to drop something, it could\u2019ve injured him. \n\nI asked her to move him and she refused. She said it was unnecessary. She didn\u2019t say that she was too tired to move him or that there was no place to out him (there was) or anything like that. She just didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to move him. We argued back-and-forth until she moved him. But yeah, some people can be mulish like that.", "NTA! Why are parents bringing their kids to a bar? Irresponsible af on their end.", "NTA. Omfg I wouldn\u2019t want to sit next to a *screaming* baby either. It\u2019s not about a little noise or a baby it\u2019s about a screaming infant hahahah.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to want to move to another table. You were both there for happy hour, not to watch a \u201chappy baby make noises\u201d", "NTA, babies obviously deserve to be in public and be babies but you\u2019re not under any obligation to subject yourself to whatever comes with it, and if your friend isn\u2019t willing to accommodate that then i would have left too. You did nothing wrong", "NTA. Babies don't belong at breweries.", "Listen, I\u2019ve got two grown kids but I wouldn\u2019t want to be near a yelling, crying screaming baby either.

Your request was reasonable. You didn't say anything to the kid or parents. Your friend probably plans to have kids someday and was upset when you made your distaste for toddler noises clear.", "NAH. I've no problem with the baby being there, but OP is entitled to not want to sit next to it. OP's friend is entitled to like babies. This just seems like a difference of opinion about whether a baby in this venue was annoying - that seems like a topic people can have different views on, don't think it makes any of them TA.", "NAH. Sensory overload is a real thing. I'll excuse myself if I can't deal. I carry earplugs, but that is more for when I'm alone. Instead of saying you don't like baby noises, say the loud noise is overwhelming you and you need to move.", "NTA \n\nCertain types of noise can be really uncomfortable for some people. Sometimes it just depends on the day you have had and what your energy is like. You tried to solve the problem by moving and your friend thought you should somehow force yourself to enjoy a noise that you found really jarring? She might have a different version of events but she can't blame you for choosing to leave. What else could you do?  \n\n\nI have occasionally been into family friendly gastropubs and asked if we could be seated away from noisy families. Of course kids are allowed to be in appropriate spaces. Adults who don't have kids are also allowed to try their best to avoid them.", "I'm not a fan of either screaming or babbling babies as well.

We have 4 kids (all adults now) I wouldn\u2019t want to see a baby at happy hour.  If you\u2019re in a touristy area or it\u2019s a regular restaurant with a brewery, it definitely happens.  I get that everyone is the cool Dad now, but it\u2019s still a bar.  Common sense says go somewhere else, sit in the way back or go at 11:00am for a burger.  I\u2019ve had to wait for a table on a Friday night in the bar area,  because parents are hogging all the real estate with 9 year old little league kids. WTH", "NTA. When a friend disregards your preferences like this it is friendship ruining, even if it is a relatively minor thing it signals they are not willing to compromise (for a minor thing). Like do these people not care about their friends??

Do you think you were all perfect kids who never made a sound? Would you like all parents to forego a social life and stick to their homes and designated play areas so you don\u2019t have your perfect silence tarnished by a giggling toddler?\n\nAll I seem to hear about these days is the untouchable sanctity of child-free weddings or disgust at parents daring to bring their kids into public transport or into restaurants. Then the same people will complain about kids being given phones and iPads to shut them up so you don\u2019t sit there tutting and sighing and sending judgemental looks. Each to their own, but at least accept that not everyone and everything can exist purely for your comfort.", "NTA. Your friends response should have been \"okay, let's move over there.\" She was being rude for not respecting your boundaries. That said, if babies/toddlers aren't outright banned (ie the place isn't advertised as 18+ only), then babies belong there and you need to accept that there's a possibility you'll come across them.

I physically cant listen to baby/toddler sounds, and I understand the need to move away from it if it bothers you.

Because there\u2019s alcohol involved? Shit, tell every restaurant ever to stop allowing kids and babies then I guess.\n\nIs it because it\u2019s a *brewery*? Because all a brewery is, is a place that sells their brewed beer. It\u2019s not necessarily an invitation to come and get drunk, it\u2019s above all else an invitation to come and try their product. A lot of breweries in my area are going the family route, probably because we\u2019re in the suburbs with a high ratio of families. Especially the ones that have an open area like a field. It\u2019s nice for parents because they can relax and their kids can enjoy the space, where as restaurants tend to trap all the sounds together and confine children who really just want to roam and run around. Plus if the space is outdoors then that\u2019s actually super ideal for a baby. It won\u2019t be as likely to be too loud, and there\u2019s not nearly as high a risk of getting sick from sharing the space.\n\nBut my bottom line is, if the establishment allows it, then you can\u2019t really argue that their allowed patrons shouldn\u2019t be there.

What part of that is AH behavior? Why should she be forced to learn to find the shrill voice of an infant pleasant? Why should she force herself to sit through this? And why is she the AH for saying she simply couldn\u2019t? The real AHs here are the parents. I don\u2019t care how cute, angelic, or perfect you believe your offspring to be, there are simply places that children shouldn\u2019t be, and chief amongst those are places primarily intended for the consumption of alcohol. Feel free to whip your titty out at Wendy\u2019s, who cares? But if you\u2019re not old enough to partake of libations, you have no business in a bar. NTA, OP. Parents have become increasingly entitled to the extent that they believe they deserve special treatment and that their child can\u2019t possibly do anything wrong.

A child has no business in this setting, and your friend clearly cares more about her own personal amusement than your comfort.

Some of my favorite childhood memories are weddings of family members, and it's so sad that selfish jerks are causing kids to miss out on memorable life experiences.  No wonder kids have social anxiety these days.", "Don't they lock themselves in the basement when they become teens? Some seem to stay there decades", "whoo does?", "Um, no you can't. Guarantee if you show up at a daycare and say you want to watch the babies the police will be called. \ud83e\udd2a", "It might surprise you to learn that people actually cannot enter daycares just to listen to the children. That usually would usually end with a call to the police.\n\nBreweries, as opposed to bars, tend to cultivate a family-friendly atmosphere and are more strict about public intoxication than bars. At least that\u2019s every brewery I\u2019ve been to. Bars make money from drunk adults, breweries make money from groups of people buying 6 packs on the way out after having a hot dog and a beer flight.", "Many breweries are restaurants and are family friendly. There is a bar section just for adults. I really doubt the baby was chowing down on max and cheese in the bar.", "Meh, maybe.  I own a pub, where we sell high end craft beer and wine...we target families and 30 to 50 year Olds with disposable incomes, and are not open very late.  We get very few drunks...people have a couple beers spread out, or with dinner, and often  take home a growler or crowder.\n\nMy cousin that owns a brewery is open later, but I think closes at 11 on weekends, and again,  not a lot of drunks.\n\nThe largest  brewery in my area is also a distillery and winery, and wven on the weekends closes early, like 8 pm to avoid a lot of drunkenness.  They have a nice restaurant,  and certainly encourage you to buy something to take home, but...", "Lol I can\u2019t tell which one you are replying to on mobile but it\u2019s funny because it fits for most of them", "Breweries literally frame themselves as family places. Parents getting a drink does not harm kids.\n\nBreweries are nit places where adults get smashed  they are places where adults get a drink and normally leave. Perfectly compatible with a toddler in real world.", "It\u2019s rare for people who are drinking to be of any harm to anyone else at an establishment like these. I worked in the industry for almost 15 years. Never have any kids been at risk of harm or neglect while at any of the places I\u2019ve worked at (in the US). \n\nThe only places I\u2019ve worked where kids are not allowed (and also that I would never recommend people bring their kids to) would be a club. \n\nKids are honestly more at risk of being harmed by their own family than anything else.", "I'm guessing OP would also want to move away from a screeching adult too, and they still wouldnt be the AH.", "like when the cicadas come out and make a bunch of noise. it overstimulates me and it makes me want to do violent things, either to them or myself. most times in the late summer i can\u2019t be outside because there are so many of them", "Gotta love the Midwest. I've been in Wisconsin for a few years and I get weird looks when I start stories with \"Me and the 4 year old were at the bar watching football...\" When taking to family back in Texas.\n\nIt's like they expect me to leave her home alone.", "I\u2019m also perplexed by this. I just went to one of the best breweries in the US and it\u2019s kid friendly. I think I\u2019ve only ever been to one that was adults only.", "They didn't throw a tantrum, they asked their friend if they could move tables away from the noisy kiddo.", "This reasoning is justified if OP had confronted the parents of the baby or otherwise made them uncomfortable, but they didn't do anything like that. \n\n\n\nOP expressed that they wouldn't enjoy their experience if they stayed next to the baby and requested to move seats. Instead of moving for their friend's comfort, OP's friend doubled down that their being right next to the baby was more important. \n\n\n\nSome people are wired to be distracted and irritated by babies, which is unfortunate, but as long as they aren't abusing kids or making things awkward for the parents, I don't think their behavior is offensive.", "No one blamed the parents or the baby. OP just wanted to move away from the baby due to noise sensitivity. Is that not a reasonable thing to do? They didn't yell at the other party but made a reasonable suggestion to their own party to simply re-locate.\n\nNTA", "The irony of you calling someone \u201cdramatic and childish for a baby simply existing near them,\u201d when it was the loud noises of the baby that the OP had a problem with, and never once denied anyone any entitlement to the world whatsoever.", "I didn't want to have my own kids so I I'm certainly not interested in anyone else's. Op didn't say anything to the people, she just wanted to move so she didn't have to listen to it. What's wrong with that?\n\n>OP threw a tantrum over a damn baby .\n\nNo she didn't.\n\n>Babies are entitled to the world too you know\n\nSo is everyone else.\n\nYou strike me as one of those parents who let their kids scream and carry on but it's someone else's problem if they don't like it.", "Not everyone likes babies or their noises, and there's nothing wrong with that. If I went to a brewery I would expect it to not have kids in it, and would've left as well. Babies don't need to go everywhere, and shouldn't be welcome everywhere", "No they aren't. Maybe they are where you are but never in my life have I seen a brewery that caters to children. I have never seen a child inside a brewery. I expect this is a regional difference.", "The baby was the DD.", "Lol I grew up in Wisconsin and have been going to bars with my family since I was a kid. I didn\u2019t know most places aren\u2019t like that until I moved away. To my kid self, they were no different than any other restaurant, except it was usually smaller, had greasier food, and an actual bar to sit at. Most eateries in my town blurred the line between bar and restaurant.", "OP went to a brewery that serves mac n cheese and seats babies.", "You\u2019ve got no idea where they went lol", "And having been one, with no consent and no memory of the fact, means exactly what? You have to love everything about babies?", "Right? I had a quick look through this comment sections and this comment's OP is up and down everywhere, losing her (?) mind over people potentially finding loud children annoying.\n\nNot kicking up a fuss and trying to kick the family out.\n\nNot arguing with the parents.\n\nNot yelling at the child.\n\nJust...not wanting to sit next to a loud one. Apparently people are *OBLIGATED* to tolerate noises/stimuli that irritate them if OP thinks so \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, and the friend barely had time to react or get up before Op gathered their things and ditched their friend and left them alone and wasted their time", "She barely gave any time to her friend to understand or get up. Maybe it wasn\u2019t easy to move tables that\u2019s why her friend was hesitant? Maybe she didn\u2019t understand what a big deal it was to OP? Because according to OP she didn\u2019t leave very much time or talk to her friend about it before she gathered her stuff and ditched her. Wasting her friends time and ruining her day. All over a baby", "She told her friend that the baby shouldn\u2019t be there at all (AH) and didn\u2019t give her friend a chance to understand her, hear her out or even get up before OP gathered their things and ditched their friend like that. Sure it\u2019s reasonable to want to move. It\u2019s not reasonable to freak out and ditch a friend like that.", "She literally said \u201cthis baby shouldn\u2019t even be here\u201d", "And you sound like one of those people who don\u2019t like kids, will never have them, so judge parents and children who exist in the world. She did have a tantrum, she didn\u2019t talk it out with her friend she immediately just ditched her friend and wasted her time. Yes everyone else is entitled to space which is my point, OP isn\u2019t more entitled to be there than that baby, even though she doesn\u2019t think so as she said \u201cthe baby shouldn\u2019t even be here\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t even like to hear kids make ANY noise or talk at all. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids. I have been a nanny AND a server for 15 years and no, I wouldn\u2019t let my kids yell or run around a restaurant. A baby making a little bit of noise is not a problem. Everyone else is talking, why can\u2019t the baby gurgle and babble? Bc its a baby?", "You shouldn\u2019t go to an all ages brewery / restaurant and expect no families to be there, that\u2019s your fault. Research 21+ establishments instead. Yes babies don\u2019t need to be everywhere. But at this place, kids are welcome. There is nothing wrong with that family wanting to dine there.", "I completely understand how when OP was seated right next to a baby, they opted for a quieter spot. I \ud83d\udcaf do this EVERY single time I\u2019m seated next to one too: restaurant, brewery, coffee shop etc. Any time I want to enjoy MY time, I will make the effort to ensure I do. I will never ever apologize for it either.", "Yeah, dog barking, cars honking, loud area of a sports bar, baby squealing, if you can find a quieter spot at the same establishment that isn't irritating, go there? It's not like OP yelled at the parents. OP just wanted to sit at literally any other table.", "This right here is what it's about. That is also my comment. This has nothing to do with the baby and everything to do with OP's friend not caring about what bothers them enough to just move to a new seat.", "Breweries are known to be more kid friendly than other drinking/food establishments, plus they must have done the calculus and decided it made more business sense to accommodate for parents to bring their kids, than insist on no kids and not have those guests come.\n\nPlenty of places where there definitely won't be kids/babies. If it's a deal breaker why not go elsewhere?", "#BEERLAND \n^for ^kids!", "Maybe if it was just a bar, but this sounds like a brewery that is also a restaurant. If it was during happy hour, then it was still relatively early in the evening too.  There is nothing weird about bringing a baby to a restaurant that also brews beer.", "in California 21+ means no babies, either.", "Unfortunately the breweries near me are very family friendly. So are the wineries. You\u2019d have to go to a full bar if you want to avoid it\n\nAnd I live in a state where by law, breweries cannot serve food", "Yes but many brewing companies make it family friendly. At least the ones I go to. They have cornhole, connect 4, large sized chess, Jenga, the works. They know that if families can come and the kids can run and play then the parents stay longer for drinks and turn it instead to a whole afternoon affair. \n\nHell even wineries are doing the same now since they realize that it's hard for parents to get a baby sitter and spend money on wine. Why not have a family environment that keeps people in it longer.", "Adults with children in tow shouldn't be drinking.", "Dogs annoy the hell out of me and I hate when they start barking. Like 95% of the breweries I have gone to have dogs all over the place. It's probably not even sanitary but I don't complain or move tables. It's a pub supposed to be noisy.", "I think people assume it's a brewery/restaurant due to the baby having mac and cheese which sounds like a restaurant dish vs something you'd order in a bar?\n\nI can think of two brewery/restaurants in walking distance of my home that explicitly have kids menus (one you can color on with the pack of two cheap crayons). They both serve somewhat hipster bistro versions of American food along with a lot of alcohol and both have killer mac and cheese. A third is not really a brewery (I don't think the company actually makes any of the beer), but has \"and brew\" in the title and people drink a lot of beer there. They have full meals but a lot of people just do alcohol and apps. It also has a toddler sized jungle gym in the middle of the outdoor tables.\n\nNow, maybe you've been to breweries that served food like mac and cheese but weren't also restaurants? Or were adult only restaurants? That's not the norm in my community. (There are bars, that's a different thing.)\n\nEdit: There are also fancy restaurants that people don't tend to take little kids to often, but they are not breweries which tend to be less fancy restaurants and more open to everyone. Also there are places for wine or beer tasting that aren't restaurants which aren't meant for kids.", "You\u2019ve never been to a pub before? They\u2019re full of kids", "It\u2019s 100% normal in the US for breweries to be family friendly restaurants. Every one I\u2019ve been to has a kid\u2019s menu and high chairs available. Kids aren\u2019t allowed in the bar section but are allowed in the restaurant. Breweries have good food!", "It's the same thing as a restaurant except they also make the beer there.", "It\u2019s not completely reasonable since it\u2019s completely wrong. Those places are called breweries but in fact legally they are just restaurants that are simply licensed to brew their own beer. On top of that, they are typically sunk if they can\u2019t attract a wide range of patrons esp families.", "Have you even been to a brewery? They usually are also a restaurant. It\u2019s completely normal and if you read many other comments, breweries are usually very child friendly. People have been drinking beer in social settings where children are present for hundreds of years. It\u2019s not strange.", "Right? Why would you not make your life easier and just go somewhere without things that irritate you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit loves to complain about child-haters (and maybe that is A Thing - I don't know 'cause I haven't paid much attention to that) but child-down-people's-throat-pushers are just as annoying.", "However I would like to be buzzed while grocery shopping. It would soften the blow of spending $8 for butter and $7 for milk"]}
