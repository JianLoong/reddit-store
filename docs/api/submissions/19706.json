It was a moderately priced restaurant (not too expensive, but nicer than McDonald\u2019s) but told them I was not paying for anyone but myself. I said I would pay for their soft drinks but not their entrees or their alcohol. Two of my friends are unemployed but were insistent on coming, I told them as long as they can find a way to pay for their entrees and alcoholic drinks I had their soft drinks covered. They said they would figure it out then two days later said they couldn\u2019t pay, I said that was okay and they didn\u2019t have to come if they weren\u2019t able to. Another friend of mine who has a bit more money than the rest of us said he would cover the other two friends entrees because he wanted everyone to be included. I told the friend he did not have to pay for them at all but he was insisting he would do so. I relayed the information to the other two friends who then made me feel bad about him paying instead of me. Another friend told me she could pay for herself then told me days later she would need me to pay for her as well. I got upset and just told everyone I was canceling the plans because I was not going to pay for their meals on my birthday. Am I the asshole for not wanting to do dinner with them because I have to pay for it?\n\nEdit: the reason I don\u2019t want to pay for everyone\u2019s meals is because I wanted to get myself a birthday gift which I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford if I paid for everyone\u2019s meals.\n\nEdit:\nI didn\u2019t want to go to a different restaurant because I really wanted sushi. I\u2019ve wanted sushi for months now but I don\u2019t want to get myself sushi more often because it can be pricey. The menu is $8-$20 for an entree.", "created_utc": 1686772347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149hbi8/aita_for_cancelling_my_birthday_dinner/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whenever I'm invited to a birthday dinner, I always assume I'm paying for my own meal, unless told otherwise. And we all chip in for the birthday person's meal. \n\nI think you made it a bit more confusing in saying you would pay for soft drinks though; should've just said everyone pays for their meal and beverages. And I don't understand why you bothered telling the friend who did want to pay for two others that they \"didn't have to\" do so.", "Strange people want you to pay for them on your birthday, it's usually others paying for the birthday person.  NTA, and I would go with the friends who are willing to pay their own way and celebrate you, or simply have a movie night at your house with soft drinks and popcorn and everyone.", "NTA re-evaluate your friends because this is giving me some heaping red flags. This is YOUR birthday. Who in their right mind expects their friend to pay everyone else for their birthday? When my friends go out for a birthday, we all pay for the birthday friend\u2019s meal; that\u2019s how it should be unless you\u2019re planning something bigger at a venue or something.

If all your friends can\u2019t afford to do the activity you\u2019ve invited them to do and another friend offers to pay for them, that\u2019s between those friends- stay out of it. If anyone cancels because \u201cthey need someone else to pay,\u201d just say you\u2019re sorry and you\u2019ll miss them. People\u2019s money is their issue and not about you. Enjoy whoever shows up and have fun!", "NTA. Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s not how birthday dinners work.", "NTA. This is so strange?? Genuine question; am I the only person who\u2019s never had to pay for a meal on my birthday? Each birthday whether I plan it myself or someone else does, someone always picks up my bill as a birthday gift. I thought this was typical and I always pay for my friends on their birthdays too.", "NTA but INFO\n\nWhy are you friends with these people?", "Wait a minute, it is your birthday, why aren't your friends paying for your dinner? I get the fact that you wanted a special treat for yourself, but when your friends became involved, they should be fighting over who pays for you dinner or how it is to be split up between them, not you flipping the bill for all of them. I have heard of the one whose birthday it is to make dinner for family or friends because they have a special knack for specific foods they can make, but to offer to buy others dinner at a pricy restaurant, that's insane.", "Guess there are cultural differences. I am from Germany where it is pretty common to ask your friends to celebrate your birthday with you. However, YOU pay the whole tab, food, alcohol etc. \n\nHere in the US it seems more common for your friends to invite you, split your bill and pay for themselves.\n\nYour situation seems more uncommon but at least you told everybody in advance you'd be going \"Dutch\". So I'll give you a tentative NTA", "NTA. Like I wouldn't necessarily expect my friend to pay for their own meal on their birthday, but if I couldn't afford it I definitely wouldn't make the birthday person feel guilty that they couldn't pay for me! \n\nI'm sorry your friends are sucky OP.", "It was YOUR birthday. NTA. Your \u201cfriends \u201c should be paying for the birthday person, not the other way around", "So, If I have this right, and please correct me if I missed something here.....\n\nYou made birthday plans for *yourself,* that's sad enough! Why didn't all these 'so called' friends do that? And you were very clear on what you could & could not pay for. Now, you've got 2 friends crying 'poor' but, at the same time, getting pissy when friend 3 offers to pay for them. \n\nThis then turned into a 'let's toss the hot potato' over who should pay for *their* own food (the 'friends' who couldn't be bothered to organize something *for you*). \n\nWhatever '*to me, from me*' gift you were saving for is unimportant. Did your 'friends' even consider getting a gift for you? Or were they too wrapped up in '*I'm not paying*\"?  \n\nSeriously honey --- you need to re-evaluate your 'friends'. The only one I'd keep is #3, who stepped up & offered to help pay.\n\nNTA    find better friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
