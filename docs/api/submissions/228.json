That's totally understandable and acceptable. You wouldn't be doing any favors by letting them copy and not learning it themselves. I'll help friends study as its usually mutually beneficial, bit people who only want to take advantage? No. \n\nCharge them for tutoring if they want you to help. And then help, but I never let anyone copy off me.", "NTA, and stop helping assholes. If they don\u2019t have a track record of being trustworthy, they should have no place in your life and def should never benefit from your work.

You can help who you want or not.  I found it tiresome to help other students because they abused my time.  It isn't that hard to be a good student, go to class, take notes, study for the test, complete the assignments.  (It isn't rocket science.)  It isn't like they are sick and only you have the medicine.", "NTA\n\nWhen I was in high school, I studied until dinner every day.\n\nMy classmates used to spend the afternoons loitering around the city, then they phoned me to get the homework.\n\nI started giving the wrong homework (bit of a-hole move, but was deserved) and they stopped, but they held a grudge and bullied me.I didn't care. The homework was my work, I didn't see why I should give it to people who weren't even my friends and did nothing for me.", "NTA.  You can choose to share or not share your time.  People may still see you as selfish,  but you are spending your time in away you value, and they are, too.", "NTA. \n\nYour classmate broke your trust. That's reason enough to never help ANY of them again. If your classmate kept her mouth shut, then that's fine, but she didn't, so now the whole class will suffer because of it. These people will NEVER succeed in the real world when all they're doing is being spoonfed answers. They're using you because they know you're good at exams, and they want to take advantage of you. \n\nYou have every right to reject giving help. This is your education. Why should you take time out of your day to help people who have very clearly demonstrated the fact that they'll never pass unless someone helps them? It's not fair for you.\n\nIf that makes you selfish and mean, then so be it. You shouldn't help them ever again. I'm on your side here, OP.", "NTA\n\nDo you get anything in return for helping your classmates?  It sounds like you get nothing back - not even respect or thanks.  So, there's no point in helping them.", "NTA you don't need to help anyone. If you don't want to don't. I advise you to make some friends, however, even just online ones. Humans need humans.", "NTA You never have to help people with their academic work if you don't want to. That's doubly true if they aren't kind or they use your help to cheat.", "NTA. Not sure if you\u2019re in high school or what, but absolutely none of these people will have any impact on your life outside school. Keep working hard and studying, ignore them, and do your thing.
