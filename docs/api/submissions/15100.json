Animal control should remove the dogs, but that\u2019s temporary until she creates another pack to replace what she lost. \n\nFrom your comments, she sounds stubborn and resistant to change, but if your sister and her children live with her, CPS will be called at some point and your mother\u2019s resistance will only hurt her children and grand children. If the kids go to school dirty and reeking if dog urine, the authorities will be called eventually. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if. \n\nHonestly, while I sympathize with your sister, she\u2019s not able to provide a safe home for her children. Intervention is needed to try to turn around this living situation. Your niblings need someone to look out for them. If you want to help them, in addition to animal control for the immediate situation, I would urgently try to find a social worker or someone who can help guide you with what public resources may be available, if you don\u2019t want to go to CPS right away.\n\nEdit: A call to adult protective services may also help to learn what resources may be available for your mother.", "NTA. But, your sister needs to be the one to call. Not just animal control but cps as well. Cps just to explain the (whole) situation, where she is in the process of rectifying, and what her plans are for the future.

She's not a bad mom by any means, but she's immensely dependent our mom for support. I've considered contacting CPS before, but I don't know if I could stomach the potential outcomes. There's otherwise no abuse or neglect I'm aware of in the home, so I was hoping the dogs could just be taken.", "Regarding the cleaning, I have a brother who lives at home who tends to be the one cleaning up after the dogs, but with that many dogs there's consistently fresh piles and puddles throughout the house.

If your mom saying anything just tell her your sister opened the door and they knocked her over and ran becUse they re so big.

She could have, but there'd have been backlash. Unfortunately, Animal Control showed up and didn't decide to remove the dogs. I can't imagine why they wouldn't have, but I'm hoping my mom at least recognizes the harm its causing everyone in her home.", "if the dogs aren't being taken you need to involve children's services. most CS are under-funded and won't take kids out of family environments unless there's fairly severe abuse or neglect. It's important to get your niblings on the CS radar in case things get worse. Who knows - CS might even do their jobs and link your sister into some services. At least things will be more monitored. \n\nI mean, how shitty would you feel if one of the dogs attacked/killed one of the children & you'd given up here?", "The dogs are not the problem. Your AH sister being a shitty parent is.", "You need to get some backbone and call CPS. What you can\u2019t stomach is far less important than what is happening to living children.

Give them a better chance than you had.", "NTA but be prepared for your sister to lose her shit when CPS rightfully tears her a new one for letting her kids wallow in dog shit.", "Another example of why adults need to be completed self sufficient and absolutely NOT rely on their parents for anything continuous. Your sister and her partner are AHs for putting their children, that they obviously can't provide for,into this horrific living situation. Your mother needs help. Absolutely call Animal Control. If this leads to the removal of the children then so be it.

Sounds like your mom has a problem with animal hoarding and is mentally unwell. You need to call Animal Control TODAY to have all the dogs removed, and CPS. Call the local shelters and have them put your mom on the Ban List so she can\u2019t adopt and bring home any more animals due to proven animal neglect. First off your mom is committing animal neglect by continuing to bring home dogs when she doesn\u2019t care for the ones she has, not potty training or caring for them, and refusing to clean up after them. Second, CPS needs to be called to have these kids temporarily removed - it is a SERIOUS HEALTH HAZARD to have 5 young kids living in a house covered in dog piss and shit and breathing all that toxicity into their lungs on a daily basis. On top of that, due to your mom\u2019s neglect I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s never taken any of these dogs to the vet or has them on flea & tick medication so you all have no idea what transmissible diseases the dogs could potentially give the kids. Your sister is the AH for having 5 kids she can\u2019t take care of and forcing her children to live in such filth. JFC.", "NTA.\n\nThis is animal hoarding. It is not safe for the dogs or the other occupants of the house.", "Would not be upset with this outcome if it meant the kids getting a clean home.", "I don't disagree with your perspective. I've encouraged my sister to leave for years because her family is just too big to be in someone else's home. But my mom also helped to create my sister's dependence on her. My sister has the ability to change, but speaking from experience, my mom makes it hard to see that.\n\nAn easy example is when I was in my early 20's, I had a drug/alcohol problem that I'd already been to rehab for, left jobs over, and destroyed relationships for. My mom's input was to tell me I should stop drinking, then buy me handles of liquor cause I was more entertaining drunk. My mom finds our worst qualities and tries to amplify them. Can't blame it all on her, but I'm sure you can imagine the difficulty of being in a situation like that.", "My thoughts exactly.  I definitely feel badly for these dogs and for the children, but seriously..... Where are the gainfully employed and responsible adults in this picture?  Your sister has FIVE kids and is living rent-free with your mom?  And you have other siblings that live there?

At least 8 though.", "She actually throws tantrums when my sister threatens to leave. She \"wants\" her grandkids close", "CPS was my first thought, too.", "That \"otherwise\" is working overtime in that sentence.", "If just a visit left your kids clothes smelling like dog piss, I guarantee you it's only a matter of time before a teacher/councilor/pediatrician/etc smells it on your sister's kids and reports it to CPS. Probably the fact that they're all under 5 and not in school yet is the only reason it hasn't happened yet. You're NTA for calling animal control (because these conditions are not good for the dogs at all), but you need to be prepared for CPS to get involved too.", "Couldn't agree with everyone more though that she needs to change", "My sister and her husband are a whole other animal I didn't dive into in this post lol. They're not terrible people or parents GIVEN that they don't need to work too hard to provide better for their kids. It's unacceptable, but a partially separate issue from the dogs. Before the recent batch of dogs, the kids lived in a typical home.", "Massive well done on getting out of that.", "This is batshit crazy (well\u2026dogshit). I\u2019m genuinely sorry your family is going through this. I support whatever you do that helps the kids and the dogs have a safe and healthier life.", "Excellent point.", "Firstly, they explained they don't want to see the kids separated. And that's a legitimate concern. CPS should be working on it too though, but we all know they don't always do their part properly either. \n\nSecondly, the dogs 100% are suffering there. The dogs should not be living in filth either. They should be taken care of, trained to go outdoors for the toilet, etc. Not crammed together into a house at such large numbers and living in the filth you recognize is not a good thing.", "Lol. At the very least her HOA would get on them. Not a bad idea except that someone outside the house or their pets could get hurt.", "Or the kids get sick from living in filth"]}
