He thinks you\u2019re being manipulative? *whistles* that\u2019s totally below the belt.- he\u2019d be a total jerk to leave his wife close to giving birth or with TWINS to look after whilst he goes on trips! Dereliction of duty there DAD! Your life changes when you have kids, sorry, but it does. Sooner he realises that\u2019s life and not \u2018manipulation\u2019 the better. Do none of your friends have kids and he\u2019s seen their lives change or that they can\u2019t go on so many trips or trips at certain times?", "NTA. Will you be allowed to go on weekend trips and visit friends and leave him at home with the twins? He\u2019s already laying a guilt trip on you for not solo-momming every long weekend; you\u2019re not the one being manipulative.\n\nIs he already planning to miss his children\u2019s first (Christmas, Easter, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving) because they all happen on holidays?", "NTA\n\nAs a father myself I will give you my perspective: What you are asking for is pretty much standard operating procedure for parents when babies come along. The social life falls off a bit as the family settles into a new normal.  It happened to me and it happened to all of my mates. It happened to my wife and it happened to all of her friends.  \n\nIf your husband is the first of his group of friends that is having kids he might have been oblivious to this fact but, now that you raised it with him, he has no excuse. To turn around and call you manipulative for being straight up honest is a pretty cruel thing to do. Essentially he is telling you that his needs and wants are to be prioritized ahead of his family's. \n\nHonestly if he has good friends they will absolutely understand and even expect him to be absent. \n\nBut there is a compromise: for fairness' sake you get to take a weekend away where he looks after the kids for every weekend away he takes. See if he's willing to consider that even as a hypothetical.", "Ugh NTA but you married one. Did he not think his life would change when he bought a house and had TWINS???? You stay home and do repairs and upkeep when you have a house, and you stay home and change diapers and try to remember what sleep was like when you have babies. \n\nHe needs an attitude adjustment in a hurry. Also, tell him since it's no big thing to be home alone with twins, you'll freeze lots of boob juice and plan girls trips and he can stay home with them. Also, get them on a bottle ASAP so Daddy can bond with them.", "You\u2019re not being an asshole, he is. If he continues to be selfish, then you will have some big decisions to make.", "NTA. Leaving on trips with a new house and new kids, especially twins, is unreasonable. The workload in those first few years is going to be immense.", "Never allow him to say \u201cI\u2019ll babysit.\u201d    There is no such thing as babysitting your own kids.  He needs to understand that he has 50% responsibility.  I don\u2019t think anyone understands how big an impact babies are until they are in the middle of chaos!  ; )", "Dude needs to pull his weight. It\u2019s seriously concerning that hes telling you up front now that youll be screwed over with the child care responsibilities. Hes setting it up now to be able to force responsibilities on you and you need to put a stop to that ASAP. Its also seriously concerning that he\u2019s acknowledging now that he wont care about you struggling and wont care about putting hardships on you then abandoning you to deal with it alone. \n\nIt may not sound that serious now, but if he is already setting it up this way, and already refusing to be a supportive husband and dad, then when it actually comes to fruition its gonna be much much worse. The bare minimum of what he should have said would be something along the lines of \u201cof course I will be there to support you through carrying and raising our child, but if i am able to find time without it being a hardship then id still like to attend the trips when its reasonable to do so\u201d he can acknowledge that hey, i dont want to become completely disconnected from my friends while still acknowledging that hes not gonna put them ahead of his family and will only go when it makes sense to do so. Also a good man would realize that youre in the same position, and he would work to make sure there are time you can get a break and go on a trip with your friends too. Having a kid doesn\u2019t mean you have to drop all your friends, but it does mean the kid and family as a whole come first. \n\nThis may not seem like such a huge red flag on the surface, but it really is. It indicates how he will view your relationship and what it means to be a father and mother. It indicates that he wont have your back and will not think twice about forcing workload and responsibilities on you. Bc you\u2019re in the relationship you may not see where this is going, but you need to realize that things like this dont stop here. He\u2019s already telling you this now, once the baby is born youll find this situation replicated in other parts of your life. I can not overstate this enough, resolve this now. Put your foot down now. Of course you are NTA, him saying otherwise is pure gaslighting. It may not be an easy conversation or one that gets through to him right away, but through both your actions and words you need to tell him you will not tolerate a husband that doesn\u2019t put his family first and who doesn\u2019t care about his wife\u2019s wellbeing. Thats like the worst trait you could have in a husband. Hopefully he realizes this sooner than later.", "NTA. Tell him if you have the kids and he's on a boys trip, he'll have divorce papers waiting for him. If you're home alone taking care of newborn twins and he's with the boys for the weekend, you'll have divorce papers waiting for him. He is going to miss out on quite a few trips in the next few years because he's about to have TWO NEWBORN CHILDREN. If he can't understand this then hes not ready to be a father.", "NTA. Your lives are changing, and he needs to understand that. Having your own house and kids is a lot of work, I could not imagine leaving my wife behind for friends on the regular. A couple of times a year, sure, but all the time? Not okay. Mom needs help from dad, especially in the first years of your babies lives where you can't do much, even showering is a challenge without your partner there watching the babies.", "NTA. The first few years of your children\u2019s life will be a lot of work and it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask him to postpone trips for a while. He can still see them and do things with them, so I\u2019m not sure why he thinks you\u2019re trying to keep him from them. I think he\u2019s just adjusting poorly to the idea of your lives changing. Hold your ground on this.", "You should have discussed expectations BEFORE even getting pregnant! You are not an AH though. He is. It\u2019s not that you need help. It\u2019s that you\u2019re in a relationship where everything should be 50/50 including sharing responsibilities and having equal time away to regen.\n\nYou MUST establish this now. He needs to know how to take care of house and kids without you. Try a different tactic. \u201cIf you plan to have 4 weekends away a year, then I get 4 and you have the house and kids to look after.\u201d Make sure he helps when they\u2019re born! Heck, split maternity and paternity leave equally if you can so he truly gets how hard it is.\n\nAdd pregnancy, vulnerability and hormones to your equation, currently. No. NTA. He is. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t agree to the above. Kick him out now. One less child to deal with.", "He shouldn't even be entertaining the thought of going on a trip right now. NTA", "NTA, he definitely shouldn't be going on any trips from when you are 30 weeks pregnant. As you know twin pregnancies can be more complicated and often deliver early. Your husband also shouldn't be going away during the newborn stage. I don't see you husband agreeing to this though, if I were you I would have a back up plan by having someone stay with you when he goes away.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s being selfish and immature. He\u2019s showing you that he doesn\u2019t plan on being a full parent and expect you to do the vast majority of childcare. \n\nHe\u2019s telling you that he plans on parenting so long as it\u2019s convenient and doesn\u2019t interfere in his other life plans. \n\nIs this what you really want?", "NTA, but my dear OP-it does NOT sound like your husband is ready to be a father and \u201csettle down\u201d. \n\nI think solo/friend trips are great-my hubs went to Vegas for his 40th when we had a six month old. That said, since we got married the boys trips significantly declined, and since having a kid I practically have to twist his arm to go\u2026.", "NTA - You should be his top priority, and that includes the house and twins.", "NTA Let him know that you will start taking trips every year too. Without him, and he\u2019ll stay home alone with the kids.", "NTA. But Girl, you made a HUGE mistake having babies with this person. He will never put you and your kids first. My advice would be to start your get away fund right now and be prepared to take care of your babies by yourself. I\u2019m sorry for the pain and aggravation you are going to have to go through.", "NTA, when you have a home and kids those should come first. Life changes so much after you have kids because they should be number 1 for both of you. Until the day those kids turn 18 they should be the first priority for BOTH parents.", "NTA, he needs to act like a husband and father, and the days of gf/bf are over.\n\nKeep in mind (and you may already know this, my bad if so) that these rules also apply to you.", "NTA. This is why I never had kids.", "Nta yeah dude, having a baby, much less TWINS, changes your life COMPLETELY.  There's no more running off to do whatever he wants bc his life is more than him now.", "NTA. This is cold and completely unreasonable. He\u2019s just expecting you to provide childcare whenever he wants for boys trips? Absolutely not. For not just one but TWO CHILDREN? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I would divorce over this. I\u2019d rather be on my own and know it than have a husband who makes me feel like I\u2019m on my own.", "NTA, he sounds shitty though. Be mentally prepared to handle everything on your own cause that is basically what he\u2019s telling you", "NTA. Your husband is a walking red flag. I'm sure he is a lovely boy, but he sure as hell isn't a man. I guess you conceived the twins either in vitro, or you had an immaculate conception. You are rightfully pissed and he needs to reevaluate his role in the household.", "You\u2019re now finding out that your husband won\u2019t be putting you and the kids first. It\u2019s him and his friends. Having one baby is hard enough but twins? It\u2019s all hands on deck. Is he ok with you taking long weekends away and him staying behind with the kids? Because you need to do this if he won\u2019t put you first. You\u2019re going to need the break. Shame on him. He really hasn\u2019t grown up, unfortunately. NTA", "YTA.

Until the twins are older, he will have to do lesser long weekend trips or make arrangements to ensure you have adequate help. That includes him budgeting for paid help. It\u2019s his kids. If he wants to be away, he still needs to step up. You\u2019re not just having one child, but two at the same time. That\u2019s going to be really difficult without the support (not just money, but time and energy as well) of your husband. \n\nBonding time with his friends is important.

He is 50% responsible for those children, not 20% and certainly not only when it\u2019s convenient for him.\n\nHe is being an A and trying to manipulate you by saying you are keeping him from his friends. His choice to have children has the natural consequence of less time to spend with friends and not having the freedom to just pick up and vacation whenever you want.  Don\u2019t let him guilt you.

Your 11, sorry, 21, whoops, missed it again, 31 year old husband better put on his big boy pants and realize he\u2019s now a homeowner and will soon be a father. That\u2019s not a part time thing. Trying to hang on to his \u2018life with the boys\u2019 is going to be a huge problem when the babies arrive.", "NTA at all. He needs to realize that being a parent is more important than weekend trips with his friends. Its selfish if he expects you to watch them alone, and I'm guessing his friends don't have kids. \n\nHe is the asshole if he does actually go through with leaving you to watch newborns and even toddlers on your own.
