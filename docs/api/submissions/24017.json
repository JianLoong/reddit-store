Hence, the child becomes the caregiver. As a result, parentified children are forced to assume adult responsibilities and behaviors before they are ready to do so. In addition, they do not receive acknowledgment or support for taking on these responsibilities.\nThe word parentification was coined by the Hungarian-American psychiatrist Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, one of the founders of the field of family therapy.

As a bi woman, I love being chivalrous to women too because theyre beautiful and wonderful and deserve to have that admiring respect. It's an ongoing process of being able to feel out a situation with a man to determine how he actually views you, as a woman to be respected or as a frail damsel to be put in a box and sheltered? That's a case by case basis with men and as a woman I know you know that. I love men. Men are so silly and fun. They do the dumbest things you've ever seen someone do just to find out what would happen and I live for that energy. I want to liberate them from the patriarchy too. The things I label as misogynistic will always be things that are rooted in an idea that women are in any way less capable or too much. And I will always try to differentiate between \"this is misognyistic\" versus \"this is influenced by/stems from/rooted in misogyny\" because those are different as well. A man calling me a bitch for not giving him my number is misogynistic. A man telling me I should have just given him a fake number to avoid the scene is rooted in misogyny. And those things aren't the same across the board for every man, it changes based on any number of circumstances for each time something happens that feels off.\n\nAgain, I am NOT labeling your father a misogynist. I am saying his aversion to changing diapers and his selecting out a woman to do it for so many reasons stems from the misogyny the patriarchy has put into the world. Even if it's from a good place. My father would never allow me around men he didn't know alone either. Because he knew that the patriarchy influence means danger for me as a little girl. So his choices were informed and influenced by patriarchy. Just like with yours. My dad isn't a misogynist. Neither is yours. But as men in a patriarchal society, they were taught stuff they didn't even realize they were taught and they can have that misogyny in them still without being one. It was a super hard realization to come to but it's only made my relationship with my dad stronger to see the ways the patriarchy failed him too with its teachings.\n\nI'm not trying to attack you or hurt you or tell you you're wrong.

Everything you've said are things *I've* said before when I had another woman challenge me to think about the small things.
