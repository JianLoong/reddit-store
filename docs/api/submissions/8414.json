Well apparently, she wasn't okay with that and gave some snide comment about \"rich people\". Also, one time I went to buy groceries with her and she told me that \"I should pay for it because I'm rich\" when I told her that we should split the cost of the eggs.

So she leaves and around 10-15 minutes later, while Pam and I are still browsing/talking to the clerk, she sends us a text that she's standing in front of the store. It's snowing outside so I told her that she should come in and meet us, but she refused. \n\nAfter maybe 5 mins, Pam is still picking and choosing so I pop out of the store and tell Amy that Pam might take a lot longer, so she should come inside and at least get out of the snow.

Because you don't walk in and purchase something? Get over yourself, plenty of people just browse and leave. \n\nAnyways, she (obviously) didn't take kindly to that and called me a \"privileged ho\" and that maybe I should just get a \"sugar daddy\" to maintain my current lifestyle (??).

You can see why rich parents needlessly buying them for their teenagers just so they can show off when her parents likely can't afford any kind of car for Amy at all, let alone one that costs more than their yearly income *just might* not be something that she finds funny, right?", "ESH. What she said to you was mean & definitely was trying to be hurtful. She's jealous of your wealth, frustrated that she has to struggle while you don't, and she needs to get over that.\n\nBut you do not consider her perspective in the least. You're not even TRYING to. \n\nI grew up poor. My fam was paycheck to paycheck. Although people couldn't tell, it impacts your life in so many ways. Physically, emotionally, psychologically, it even messes with you. You have constant stress and worry about just making it, and you're in constantly on survival mode. You always worry when the \"other shoe is going to drop.\" \n\nI'm now I'm an adult & STILL from time to time, I find myself still thinking this way. You don't know what that's like at all, and haven't even tried to get her POV, to listen to her, to empathize, to make a genuine connection with your friend about how she's had to struggle. I have friends & exes who had significantly more money than me, and they ALWAYS had time to chat with me & listen to me & just be there & supportive of my struggles from day one. That's what a friend does. \n\nFor the record, she IS right about certain shops/places judging you for going in when you \"aren't their target audience.\" I've experienced it, others I know have too, but you'll get dirty looks/looks at security guards being given because you're someone they don't think \"belongs\" there. Think the scene in the Selena movie when she's shopping. We also had the racism/prejudice to fight with myself &my fam, but it's also socioeconomic and they will INSTANTLY make you feel unwelcome. It's gotten a bit better in some cases and over time as  more tolerant people work at stores, but it's still there with some. My best revenge is when I go into a store when someone clearly has that look, I ignore that person, and I go to a nicer or just another store associate and get what I want \ud83d\ude01 But your friend IS right. That still happens & she's valid. \n\nAlso, YTA for how you handled that as well. You could've said, \"hey, you're my friend, and you know I'll have your back if they try to mess with you\" or something supportive/reassuring. But nah, you just told her she has an inferiority complex.", " I grew up on the lower end of the income scale. Last month I was walking in an expensive area of Toronto and I saw a bracelet through the window of a shop. I can certainly afford to buy the jewelry but I was afraid to go inside because I was afraid of being judged. I decided to wait until my husband was with me. And I am 35 years away from my straitened upbringing. Amy\u2019s only a few months from hers. It\u2019s very hard to feel okay in that kind of exclusive retail space when one has always been taught, \u00e0 la Brave New World, that such things are not for one\u2019s class. \n\nESH for a bunch of impolite conversations. I hope you can both learn to be more understanding.", "I think it's more complicated than you being an ah or not. Personally, I think you're kinda the AH, but not intentionally. Let me explain. You grew up extremely privileged. Having done that you really can't comprehend exactly how paralyzing her insecurities can be from growing up in a Low Income household. It fundamentally changes your outlook and self awareness. Having also grown up poor in childhood and early adulthood and having to stretch 10 bucks ( around 2.80 in the 80s, adjusted from when I was a kid) to feed 4 people dinner absolutely makes you self conscious.  It carries into adulthood. When/if you become stable  you tend to be incredibly generous with any disposable income to others or be a  incredibly thrifty.  Her asking you to buy eggs, while impolite the way she said it, is entirely underandable. Asking for help isn't easy and often comes out wrong. You pushing her to come along when she didn't want to shows your lack of understanding and compassion and makes you an unintentional AH", "ESH, more y.t.a.\n\nNot sure why Amy would agree to go to the store in the first place when clearly she didn't want to be there. Her comments after seem harsh and unhelpful.\n\nMuch more y.t.a.\n\nThe only people who say money doesnt matter are people who have money. It is an insane differentiator if you don't have it or grew up without.\n\nIt's fine if you grew up with similar people but not everyone grew up with a family Porsche. You're old enough that you should realize that by now.\n\nBut it boils down to your friend being clearly uncomfortable with a situation/context which it seems like you understand, but are actively choosing to ignore/dismiss because it doesn't fit your internal narrative.", "YTA \n\n\u201cOhhh but everyone has a Porsche sooooo\u2026\u201d\n\nYou definitely like to show people you are better off!

I dated a guy years ago that grew up wealthy who would try to drag me off to designer stores to shop. He walked into them already wearing designer, with confidence and was treated very differently than when I went in on my own to browse. The staff absolutely know who is in there to buy and who can only afford to browse, and the treatment you get is very different.", "YTA\n\nLet her stand in the snow if she wants. Tif&Co is set up to make people of her class uncomfortable, and she would have been uncomfortable there. I too would rather stand in the snow than suffer the humiliation of being kicked out or accussed of stealing, things which do happen to the less wealthy in places like that.\n\nIf someone I know told that Porsche story, I too would make a snide comment about the bourgeois. That story is an obscene display of wealth. Also she asked you for help buying groceries (not in a nice way, sure), and you not only refused, but held it against her. Just pay for the eggs, you have enough money for three lifetimes, right?\n\nYou saying you don't care about people's background, whether they're rich or privileged means nothing until you take active steps to make the less privileged comfortable in your prescence.", "\u201cI don\u2019t need no sugar daddy\u2026\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay in school.  \ud83d\ude44", "Oh. It looks like you have absolutely no clue how 90% of people actually live, to be honest.\n\nStory about driving Porsches on the maximum speed and not being fined is about wealth. It's about rich kid's entertainment that *breaks the law* and them not having to deal with consequences of breaking the law *because their parents are rich* and they are driving expensive cars in rich (and not over policed) neighborhood. You literally told a story about your peers showing off wealth and breaking the law, and endangering other people's lives FOR FUN, and you are surprised that she made *a snide comment*?\n\nAlso... Maybe she *is* rude sometimes. Maybe it's inconvenient for you to accommodate her insecurities. Maybe she isn't even a nice person. Maybe you don't want to deal with comments about your wealth. All of it doesn't make comments about stop-this-poor-people-shit and \"leave your inferiority complex\" okay. It is punching down and mean even if she was rude to you previously.\n\n When she didn't want to go inside the store she didn't stop you from doing it. You could go without her or stay with her, either way there's absolutely no need to comment on her class, complexes or whatever.", "YTA.\n\nI agree that Amy asking you to pay for eggs and judging you for eating out is not right, but for this situation alone, YTA. \n\nAmy didn\u2019t actually say why she didn\u2019t want to enter the store, she only said no. She didn\u2019t complain, or make any comment about poor people not being able enter luxury stores. That was all your own judgment based on how you see Amy as a person. What you said was inflammatory and unkind, and it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t understand how life is different when you don\u2019t have parents with enough money \u201cfor three lifetimes\u201d.", "this is complex but yes, YTA \n\nyou may not realize it but you remind Amy every day of what she doesn\u2019t have / hasn\u2019t had \n\nand those reminders and those missed experiences are more detrimental to her in the long run than her snide remarks are to you \n\nyou\u2019re experiencing her anger and that sucks \u2026 not the way growing up poor sucks though \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some other kind of oppression you\u2019ve experienced that maybe you can use as a comparison but basically the experience of oppression is always worse than the anger that sometimes get directed at the privileged. Young women don\u2019t always get the full experience of sexism (that tends to impact you extra as you enter to the workforce) but if you have had a taste of that you can try and think of it that way.\n\nYou could walk away from Amy if you wanted to. She can\u2019t walk away from poverty. And going to a place like Tiffany\u2019s is being confronted with that in a big way. You can casually buy expensive jewelry as a gift. She\u2019s not had that experience. She\u2019s trying to keep up and tag along but it\u2019s prob mega stressful for her to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s not an inferiority complex - she\u2019s grappling with the complexities of trying to make friends she can\u2019t keep up with financially, prob dealing with college over all which is expensive, and not quite sure how to talk about it with people she likes but who clearly don\u2019t understand her POV.\n\nYou\u2019re both young and college is the first time a lot of people meet people who are very different from them. You\u2019re likely to meet a lot of people in your life who don\u2019t see Porsches and Tiffany\u2019s as mundane experiences. If you can, use this as a chance to learn. Learning how to relate better to people who aren\u2019t like you is one of the best things college has to offer.", "ESH.\n\nYou were rude, but I'd lay money on it that had you not encouraged your friend to go into the shop, she would have told everyone you left a poor person standing in the snow while you burned \u00a350 notes and laughed in her face. \n\nYour friend was being silly, she may feel uncomfortable around expensive things, but that something she has to get over. And constantly making reference to her family's lack of wealth, or asking you to pay for things because yours are wealthy, is not going to make her feel better.\n\nHOWEVER, you need to tone down the rich girl stories. That's a lesson for life. They can make you sound obnoxious.", "ESH.\n\nIf you hadn't said the thing about the inferiority complex, you wouldn't have done any harm IMO.\n\nThe thing is, from what you described, she has obviously been put down in the past for her lack of wealth. I mean where do you think one gets an inferiority complex in the first place?\n\nYou could have just said if that's what you wanna do, and left her standing there.", "I'm honestly confused about these comments. All of you are judging her because she was born wealthy while preaching she should be more understanding and open towards Amy. Why doesn't it go both ways? Why is it that those who are born poor / have a disability / different sexuality get to be assholes without consequences but the second you are white and born in to a middle class / rich family, you're an asshole? \n\nWhy is it that OP has to completly change the way of living her life just to accomodate one person? I mean like she said in the comments, it's not about Amy asking for small financial help (eggs), it's the way she does it. Just because she had an unfortunate upbringing, doesn't justify her being an asshole. And honestly, i would also not entertain someone so demanding judging in my life, no matter how open minden and helpful i am.\n\nSo yes, it is important to listen to each other and expand our views but that doesn't mean we should accept being shitted on for something we can't do anything about.\n\nThis is how life is.

I moved out at 17 and had to hold down a day job and a night job just to survive and pay for online school.

We took the bus to the food bank and held down multiple jobs while in school so we could crawl out of poverty. Now I\u2019m a nurse and make decent money, but I also only work part time because I\u2019m GREAT at money management after been poor for so long. I have had friends make snide comments about being \u201crich\u201d and how I should pay for things, and I just shut them down fast. We\u2019ve always been super generous with our money even when we were poor but were surprised to see how many people felt entitled to our generosity once we started making livable wages\u2026 it\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019d like to give out of the kindness of my heart, not because people expect it of me. Plus, I\u2019m a part time ski instructor and a part time nurse, and my husband is a ski instructor, we\u2019re living OUR personal dream, but would still be considered either upper lower class or lower middle class.

She has a chip on her shoulder and instead of wanting to get over it in order to enjoy life she is content to bring others down to her level.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are definitely some instances where you should share your privilege with her (I'm not saying you don't, I just don't know), like, offering to pay for her meal at a fancy restaurant so that you can enjoy one of life's pleasures together. But not wanting to come into the store with you, that was dumb.

She knew Pam wanted to shop at Tiffany's but agreed to go anyway. She could have just refused on account of being uncomfortable.

Like, I really think she\u2019s a lot more well-off than she makes herself out to be (has a car for herself, multiple pieces of jewelry, a pretty nice mid-high end luxury bag, and is also going to our college with no debt and not full scholarship). Heck, she has more clothes in her closet than me. She sends me so many mixed signals, I don\u2019t understand.", "Honestly the thing that tips OP into asshole territory for me is the way she punched down during the argument. I also would hate it if someone made snide comments about my (relatively privileged) upbringing but I can never ever imagine telling someone with less money 'you have an inferiority complex' and 'my parents will make more than yours would in 3 lifetimes'. Like that last comment is so hurtful and telling of OPs mindset it was a disgusting thing to say. \n\nAlso, to me nothing her friend did was that terrible. It was a bit cheeky to ask for OP to pay for eggs but imo it is way more embarrassing of OP, a very financially privileged individual to be counting pennies and insisting her friend with a total income of 36k pays equally. Ironically it is always rich people who are miserly like this. And why even tell the Porsche story if not to make fun of rich people?

I paid my way or I didn\u2019t go because I had friends at my level of poor you could say? that I would hang out with.

For example, when I used to drive a shitty $500 car I would get pulled over for everything and cops treated me like shit. A couple years ago my parents moved cross country and sold me their car for a good price, this car is a basic white lady car and looks MUCH nicer than my old car. It was still only a couple grand, but it has the appearance of a bit of money to it. I rarely get pulled over now and when I do cops are super nice. Your comment reminded her of your privilege and her struggles.", "And your story further highlighted what a discrepancy between rich and poor there is. For Amy having her car towed would have been a major thing, not jsut because of the inconvenience, but the cost would have had a major impact on her family. Your friends racing their cars without care for the consequences highlights just how privileged you are compared to her. Not only did the rich kids get away with driving in an incredibly dangerous and selfish way that could have cost other people their lives, whilst Amy suffered considerably for what was probably just a minor parking offense, they didn't even care about getting caught as for your friends, the fine would have little impact on your lives. You're kinda being purposely ignorant of the difference your privilege allows you.", "Privilege can basically be boiled down having a choice about whether you want to think about something or not. \n\nStraight people can choose whether to engage with homophobia. They can ignore it if they want to.\n\nAble bodied people don\u2019t have to check for wheelchair ramps. \n\nWhite people can choose to be anti racism but if they\u2019d rather not bother, they can just not. \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable confronting your privilege and realizing that other people don\u2019t have what you have through no fault of their own. And that you\u2019re basically just lucky that you were born who you are. \n\nYou can absolutely choose to stay emotionally comfortable and tune Amy out. Wealth gives you that ability.

Like the kids at your high school not giving a shit about potentially being landed with a speeding fine that could be 2 weeks groceries or even a month's rent, is such a glaring example of the kind of privilege that is hard for Amy to hear about. I can only imagine how much her family must have scrimped to afford her a car on 36k, and how stressful it must have been for her car to be towed...so I really don't blame her for calling out rich kids who don't seem to give a shit about cars that cost like 10 years of rent.", "I meant it when I said you're like this 'unintentionally', I don't think you're a 'bad person' based on this alone and I also think Amy could have approached this better (she could just have not come at all).\n\nBecause of your upbringing and the people you've previously socialised with you've never really had to understand what growing up low-income is like. I obviously don't know the specifics of Amy's life, but it's likely that her parents work *extremely* hard to scrape together enough to get by. And that's likely genuinely the best they can do. They won't ever have as much money as your family no matter how hard they work, and it's quite possible that they put in longer hours than your parents do. \n\nI'm not saying your parents 'do nothing' or have never worked hard, just that hard work doesn't really correlate to income. That said, the lowest income people in any organisation are generally doing the least attractive work, and a lot more of it. \n\nMany rich families hire cleaners and so on as well - does yours? Amy's parents have to do all of that themselves. That's effectively hours of extra work every week. \n\nThings that were trivial gifts for you growing up were unimaginable luxuries for her in loads of ways you might never have thought of. She may have never had an international holiday, for example.\n\nIt's not just long term though, it's day to day as well.Let's look more closely at the food example. Going out to eat or getting a takeout is an insignificant expense for you, and when you do cook you probably never need to worry about selecting ingredients or recipes based on price. Amy's family, by contrast, has to make decisions like that. Were those eggs the budget option, or were they top range ones? She was clumsy in that interaction, but even that tiny expense might have been significant to her, both in raw cost and though it consuming some of her food budget, which could be as low as $15 a week.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/) might be worth a look to get a bit of perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also worth bearing in mind that there are a *lot* more families like Amy's than there are families like yours. Have you ever heard the term 1%? It's that 1% of society has over 50% of the wealth. The other 50% is split between nineteen out of every twenty people.\n\nIt's not your 'fault' that you're rich, of course, but it's not her fault that she's poor either.\n\nI noticed that in another comment you say that you think she envies you. Again, I don't know her and I don't know how she thinks, but rather than assuming it's envy I'd consider that it could be anger at the injustice of income inequality. It might not even be 'about' you as much as you're a constant reminder of it while being (no offence) pretty clueless about what the reality of it means.", "Again... Read the whole thread.

You look \u201csuspicious \u201c and they make you feel like crap. Or even worse accuse you of wrong doing, therefore you just don\u2019t take the risk. \n\nOP can\u2019t even wrap her mind around being made to feel that way - she has a whole different set of societal rules engrained in her and hopefully college opens up her eyes a bit to just how different a privileged life is.", "Am I missing something?

That isn't to say you need to censor yourself, but to realize that you may come off differently than you intend to; you might fair better at that by taking a moment beforehand to think about what you're saying. You don't need to change for Amy, but one of the points of college these days is precisely to put you in an arena where you get to know other people and be exposed to other points of view and other people's life experiences. That's part of how you learn. And if you don't grow from learning, you're kind of missing the point. \n\nFor example, can you see in retrospect why a casual comment about virtually everyone in your *high school* driving a Porsche might come off as privileged and/or boastful? Your new roommate might well be hypersensitive to matters of wealth and that's something she's going to have to work on, but you also need to be aware that you're coming off as pretty tone deaf.", "Apologize.

If you truly didn't care, you wouldn't have got defensive the first time someone in a lower income bracket called attention to rich people bs. Nothing Amy said until you said she had an inferiority complex' was really that personal, and yet you seem extremely defensive about the fact that your high school friends drove ridiculously expensive cars and the fact that you're rich.

However, in my teenage year, I saw my dad lose his job and how he struggle to pay for mortgage at that time which resulting in him working some menial jobs. My mom taking side jobs apart from her full time jobs. And how they seem to be more frugal in their spendings. Of course they don\u2019t complaint and make it obvious to me and my sibling that they are struggling, but you can just see all this and you at your young age just know that you can\u2019t ask for much from your parents. I had joined an extracurricular activity in school because it seems fun but after a while we had to pay a certain fee, and when I knew that, I quit right away. I didn\u2019t even bother asking them because I was worried we cannot afford it. That\u2019s what life are for people who are not born wealthy. We are very conscious about money and I\u2019m not even someone who lives in poverty. \n\nYou however OP, does have a lack in sympathy and you lives in your own golden box that was endowed to you since birth. If you want to have friends from various socioeconomic background you need to know how the real world works. When I entered Uni I met a friend with rich parents and we become best friends. Not once she made me feel small or feel resentful of my upbringing. You know why? Because she lives in the real world, not in her parents shining box. She is fully aware of the cost of living. What she deemed expensive, is expensive to me and what she deemed cheap, really is cheap to me. Despite coming from wealthy parents, she was raised like any normal kids. Were given around the same amount of allowance, she drained them, of course her dad just give her more but not before giving her an earful about her spendings. \n\nBecause she is exactly like us, it always made me forget about her privileges. But there are sometimes when I\u2019m reminded by it like how she got a car during uni. That time I do envy her, but it only lasted for awhile because after that she was talking about doing uber for her petrol. And she did that. She would wake up early and do it for a few hours a day.

But fact is we would do what they did had we been in that position just as easily, we will never know and cannot judge/assume based on what could be\u2026", "OP never said that their parents make more in 3 lifetimes than hers, OP said they didn\u2019t need a sugar daddy because her parents have enough wealth for three lifetimes. That\u2019s not even remotely the same as what you claim was said.", "I definitely side eyed the Porsche comment. It\u2019s kind of \u2026 tone deaf? To talk about how you don\u2019t notice class/class doesn\u2019t matter and then make comments like \u201cpeople drove Porsches to show off, but that\u2019s not impressive cause everyone had Porsches \ud83e\udd2a\u201d. Obviously the friend shouldn\u2019t have done/said the stuff she has either, but geez OP would be grating to be around if she says that kind of stuff often", "You asked earlier if you're destined to only be friends with rich people \u2013 hard truth is that if you ever want to have genuine friends who aren't wealthy like you are, you'll have to put in consistent effort to be sensitive and empathise and understand where they're coming from every day.\n\nAnd honestly, that is a very small price to pay compared to the struggles of being poor. \n\nIf you don't put that effort in you'll probably have a smattering of less privileged friends throughout your life, but you'll alienate so many more within minutes without even realising.", "I know, right? The poors can be so exhausting.", "It definitely is.", "I'm not 100% what you mean here, privilege is absolutely tied to economic class just as it is to race, gender, sexuality etc, am I misunderstanding or do you not think that??", "My best friend comes from a wealthy family and I grew up poor. His mom asked me to be her Maid of Honor at their wedding. It was a small wedding and on my 18th birthday. I said yes but didn't have the clothes so we went shopping. At the first store we went to the sales person was an ahole. So we went to a few other stores and I got some really nice clothes that day. We made sure to walk back through the store and made sure that sales lady saw exactly what I was carrying while walking back to the car. I honestly pulled the whole pretty women move and made sure she realized she lost her commission. \n\nThat said that was the only time I have had that happen. Most sales people are pretty decent. Right before covid I had to go to a wedding. I have a bad back so I don't normally wear heels because they are uncomfortable but he offered to buy them and while they cost a decent amount I have heels I can wear that don't mess up my back. None of the sales people gave me a hard time nor have they 99.9% of the time I have gone in those stores. \n\nThe only way you will ever get comfortable is to walk in the store.", "Having gone through financial insecurity is so much more than a chip. It's subconscious and insidious. However, it doesn't excuse asking someone more wealth to pay for something, that's honestly weird in my opinion. Though maybe her way of asking for help by making it a dig, I don't know. Most people who grow up financially insecure tend to be most generous and very weird about anyone doing them financial favors, but I guess some can go other ways as well.\n\nWays it's impacted me - I find it extremely hard to accept gifts or anyone paying for me. It gives me huge guilt and a feeling of needing to repay so that we can be on equal footing again. This sadly makes many relationships end up being transactional.\n\nI don't try new foods when eating out, even though I can afford it now, there's this inner child that can't spend money on something you may not like, have to get tried and true.\n\nI can't stop eating when there is free food, buffet, weddings, office potluck. It's like some internal mechanism says, \"eat what you can even if it's bad for you because it's free.\"\n\nBringing attention to frivolity can also be a way to fight internal insecurity. I'll be that's what was happening with the Tiffany thing. Is it the right way to handle? Absolutely not. But some of these things are so deep and insidious.\n\nMy gut is she is deeply insecure and knows she can't measure up. Therapy would be helpful. A bit of empathy (or just grace) would be too. College is a hard time for people with different means.\n\nOverall I have to say ESH. Amy's issues arent your problem, but maybe some reassurance that she doesn't need material things to be valued would be helpful. OP, you do come out a bit head in the clouds and naive about how most people have to live. Mentioning that \"everyone drove Porsches so not a big deal\" seems a bit bratty as well.", "You are absolutely correct. Reddit sees an OP with money and immediately goes \"They are the AH.\" Then they complain about poor relations between the socioeconomic classes as if it is entirely the fault of the \"rich snobby people\" rather than a combination of shitty people that permeate all classes. It baffles them that you can be an AH and be poor or be an AH and be rich.", "Yep mea culpa, I accidentally misremembered the quote and do agree that what OP actually said is nowhere near as bad. Although still kind of tacky to say imo.\n\nI can empathise with Amy's behaviour- maybe she wanted to join in on the girls trip and then started feeling insecure or uncomfortable at the last minute. At which point she did the right thing- waited outside. She only became when defensive when OP pushed her boundaries.", "Ah that's fair enough, I misremembered the exact quote when typing my comment", "Someone feeling uncomfortable in a designer/expensive shop is not an inferiority complex. It's a completely natural response to feeling out of place, especially in places literally set up to exclude people below a certain income bracket. Amy has probably grown up with people being snobby with her family in shops. And neither of the other 2 examples OP gave scream inferiority complex either. It's an extremely insulting thing to call someone and disagreeing with someone's and poor choice of words not abuse lmao, and to say so discredits actual abuse victims.", "There's confronting your own privilege (which I agree that OP should do) and then there's putting up with poor treatment from anyone for no fault of your own. Amy is not necessarily wrong for asking for help with groceries but to not say thanks and to \"expect\" OP to pay for her is extremely entitled and makes Amy not a good person to have in OP's life. \n\nWtf? Just cuz you're poor, doesn't make you a charity case. No one is ENTITLED to financial help from their friends.", "This is beautifully phrased! I wish I had an award to give you!", "From the comments I've seen, I think most people are pointing to the Porsche story as an example of how OP is unaware of her privilege.  Like, of course it was unintentional, but you have to know your audience for that type of thing.  People growing up in a different socioeconomic class are likely not going to be able to relate to a story like that, and since they can't relate, it may feel like \"flaunting\" their wealth.  OP may not have meant anything by it, but this is her learning that different people may react differently to these issues.  I think this is part of growing up, honestly.  Everyone in this story is young and on their own for the first time, and likely this is the first time spending time with a more diverse group of peers.  Navigating these types of social situations is, imo, a part of the essential education that comes with college.  I just hope OP's takeaway is \"I should learn to be more sensitive about these topics\" rather than \"dang, poor people are sensitive and entitled, I should only hang out with fellow rich people.\"", "I believe they are referring to class like \u2018having class\u2019 as in behavior.", "Wrong class", "100% this.", "One rule all luxury sellers have is that you treat every client like a star. Most old money folks don't flash their money all day every day. Some don't like high fashion, so they dress \"ordinarily\". Even if someone is poor, if one day they get rich, they'll remember that nice person from the store that treated them well and are more likely to buy there. The number of stories I heard of people not getting commissions because they were assholes or dismissive to the wrong mega rich person that dressed like your high school teacher...", "Amy's issues would be fine if they were internal, but she is lashing out against people that have harmed her in now way other than being different to her. That makes her the asshole, OP did not start anything, nor did she go over the top in her reactions", "All I can say is I have been right more times than I would have liked.", "All I saw is that she made a comment that OP should cover the \u2248 2$ for the eggs. Maybe 2.50$ with the egg crisis. \n\nWhich could have been \u201csnarky\u201d, could have been a joke that didn\u2019t land. Entitled? I guess it depends on how you picture that scene. Based on OP\u2019s description, I\u2019m imaging a throwaway comment. Not Amy stomping her foot and demanding eggs. \n\nBut for sure - could be that Amy demanded eggs as reparations.\n\n(Why should Amy have thanked her? Nowhere does it say OP ended up springing for the eggs \ud83e\udd14)", "gotcha thnx!", "Now this is true! When I went to Burberry, I saw an older Asian gentleman and he looked like a farmer. Very humble clothing. Yet this man was buying out the store for his wife and daughter. They left with multiple bags in each hand.", "This exactly! I'm needed a suit on really short notice once. I was looking at designer ones because they're made to be hemmed usually and I'm too tall for most women's off-the-rack. I'd spent 2 hours basically sprinting between stores looking for anything cheaper that was long enough so by the time I made it to the nice shops I was a gross, sweaty mess.\n\nI got hauled away from the small designer rack at the department store I went to by a woman who insisted I should look at more budget options. When I stomped over to Nordstrom, the woman there came up and asked if I needed help, pulled three madly expensive suits for me to try, and gave me a white shirt that cost more than any that I owned to try them on with even though it needed cleaning after.\n\nNot only did I end up buying the exact suit I was hauled away from in the other shop, but I've since gone back to Nordstrom every time I need something on short notice/without fuss because I know that they won't judge me for how I look, and will find me what I need. I'm not rich and thrift most of my clothes, but good customer service can make a big difference.\n\ntl;dr there's that exact story you mentioned pretty much.", "it does depend on the place but yeah, this is how they *should* operate.  I\u2019ve always been treated extremely well at Tiffany, even when I was clearly a poor kid just fantasizing\u2026 but when I went to Louis Vuitton with actual money to spend, they ignored me so I ended up buying a purse from Coach instead.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  I\u2019ve also witnessed my mom being treated very rudely at a high end furrier in NYC, but that was many years ago and I can\u2019t remember the name.", "Actually I disagree. My first time in LA I went into multiple high end stores, Burberry, Hermes etc and was made to feel like shit. \nI may have gone into the stores that don\u2019t treat everyone well but I had that experience.\nAlso in different countries it\u2019s different. \nI get looked down upon in middle to high end stores in both Australia and New Zealand but in the Philippines I was greeted warmly.", "A lot of places where \u201cfree\u201d or \u201clow cost\u201d therapy is offered, it often comes with a heavy-handed helping of \u201chave you tried Jesus?\u201d", "And like there's a difference between going to browse with your mates when none of you can afford the thing and just want to laugh because none can afford it than going with your mates when one is actually planning on buying anything.\n\nElsewhere she comments about her friend having a Tiffany necklace of her own and it just makes me think of the topaz earrings I was gifted on my 18th as a coming of age present by my family and I could never afford to buy such a thing for myself or a friend now as a working adult and certainly not as a uni student - it's just like that thing your family save up to buy because this is special (and I come from a thoroughly middle class family, not evening working class) and the difference between owning an expensive thing as a gift given to you by family after saving for a special occasion and being able to just casually buy the thing as a college student for someone else", "That\u2019s very probable.", "There are outliers for sure. Those are the fools that screw themselves out of commissions.", "Yes. You will only be friends with the rich, just get used to it.\n\nBeing friends with richer people is stressful on its own due to differences in lifestyles (where you can afford to go out to, for example), and less rich people often don't have the time or energy to deal with that. Unless you are willing to accommodate the lifestyle differences, they just will not be willing to be friends with you. That's their choice, and a direct consequence of your choices.", "Don't go to reddit asking for advice. Your friend has been taking digs at you. You have not done anything wrong. It is always important to treat all people with dignity and respect no matter what situation they are in, but when that is repaid by abuse, you are absolutely allowed to treat people based upon the contents of their character. Also, the idea that you should just be ok with her taking digs at your financial situation is ridiculous. She does that all the time and it is supposedly ok with these Reddit folk. You do it once to get some person to come in out of the cold and you are the AH. They aren't objective, and their advice sucks.", "With Medicaid?", "I hope she does come back at some point and read these, there are some great points being made", "Yep. In rural and low-income areas? Absolutely.", "She is projecting as are all the others supporting Amy.  Lots of people here who have inferiority complex and believe they are entitled to mistreat someone just because they may be wealthier than them.
