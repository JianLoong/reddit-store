Well apparently, she wasn't okay with that and gave some snide comment about \"rich people\". Also, one time I went to buy groceries with her and she told me that \"I should pay for it because I'm rich\" when I told her that we should split the cost of the eggs. WTF?\n\nWell, here comes the AITA part. So, a mutual friend (\"Pam\") of ours wanted to go to Tiffany (the jewelry store) to buy a gift for a relative. Pam wanted us to come along and we both agreed to go. On the day of, we take the bus there and at the entrance of the store, Amy suddenly says that she'll be going to grab boba down at KFT down a couple blocks and will meet us back here. Pam and I feel a bit confused since she never said she was going separately from us but we said okay and that we might take longer than her. So she leaves and around 10-15 minutes later, while Pam and I are still browsing/talking to the clerk, she sends us a text that she's standing in front of the store. It's snowing outside so I told her that she should come in and meet us, but she refused. \n\nAfter maybe 5 mins, Pam is still picking and choosing so I pop out of the store and tell Amy that Pam might take a lot longer, so she should come inside and at least get out of the snow. Nope, apparently \"poor people\" aren't able to even enter luxury stores because of who-knows-what. We're not even telling her to buy anything, and it's not like the store would kick you out for just looking?? I really couldn't understand her logic and told her that \"I don't understand your inferiority complex\" and that you'd rather stand out in the snow because you think that just walking into a luxury store means that people will automatically know *and* judge you for being poor? Because you don't walk in and purchase something? Get over yourself, plenty of people just browse and leave. \n\nAnyways, she (obviously) didn't take kindly to that and called me a \"privileged ho\" and that maybe I should just get a \"sugar daddy\" to maintain my current lifestyle (??).

You can see why rich parents needlessly buying them for their teenagers just so they can show off when her parents likely can't afford any kind of car for Amy at all, let alone one that costs more than their yearly income *just might* not be something that she finds funny, right?", "ESH. What she said to you was mean & definitely was trying to be hurtful. She's jealous of your wealth, frustrated that she has to struggle while you don't, and she needs to get over that.\n\nBut you do not consider her perspective in the least. You're not even TRYING to. \n\nI grew up poor. My fam was paycheck to paycheck. Although people couldn't tell, it impacts your life in so many ways. Physically, emotionally, psychologically, it even messes with you. You have constant stress and worry about just making it, and you're in constantly on survival mode. You always worry when the \"other shoe is going to drop.\" \n\nI'm now I'm an adult & STILL from time to time, I find myself still thinking this way. You don't know what that's like at all, and haven't even tried to get her POV, to listen to her, to empathize, to make a genuine connection with your friend about how she's had to struggle. I have friends & exes who had significantly more money than me, and they ALWAYS had time to chat with me & listen to me & just be there & supportive of my struggles from day one. That's what a friend does. \n\nFor the record, she IS right about certain shops/places judging you for going in when you \"aren't their target audience.\" I've experienced it, others I know have too, but you'll get dirty looks/looks at security guards being given because you're someone they don't think \"belongs\" there. Think the scene in the Selena movie when she's shopping. We also had the racism/prejudice to fight with myself &my fam, but it's also socioeconomic and they will INSTANTLY make you feel unwelcome. It's gotten a bit better in some cases and over time as  more tolerant people work at stores, but it's still there with some. My best revenge is when I go into a store when someone clearly has that look, I ignore that person, and I go to a nicer or just another store associate and get what I want \ud83d\ude01 But your friend IS right. That still happens & she's valid. \n\nAlso, YTA for how you handled that as well. You could've said, \"hey, you're my friend, and you know I'll have your back if they try to mess with you\" or something supportive/reassuring. But nah, you just told her she has an inferiority complex.", " I grew up on the lower end of the income scale. Last month I was walking in an expensive area of Toronto and I saw a bracelet through the window of a shop. I can certainly afford to buy the jewelry but I was afraid to go inside because I was afraid of being judged. I decided to wait until my husband was with me. And I am 35 years away from my straitened upbringing. Amy\u2019s only a few months from hers. It\u2019s very hard to feel okay in that kind of exclusive retail space when one has always been taught, \u00e0 la Brave New World, that such things are not for one\u2019s class. \n\nESH for a bunch of impolite conversations. I hope you can both learn to be more understanding.", "I think it's more complicated than you being an ah or not. Personally, I think you're kinda the AH, but not intentionally. Let me explain. You grew up extremely privileged. Having done that you really can't comprehend exactly how paralyzing her insecurities can be from growing up in a Low Income household. It fundamentally changes your outlook and self awareness. Having also grown up poor in childhood and early adulthood and having to stretch 10 bucks ( around 2.80 in the 80s, adjusted from when I was a kid) to feed 4 people dinner absolutely makes you self conscious.  It carries into adulthood. When/if you become stable  you tend to be incredibly generous with any disposable income to others or be a  incredibly thrifty.  Her asking you to buy eggs, while impolite the way she said it, is entirely underandable. Asking for help isn't easy and often comes out wrong. You pushing her to come along when she didn't want to shows your lack of understanding and compassion and makes you an unintentional AH", "ESH, more y.t.a.\n\nNot sure why Amy would agree to go to the store in the first place when clearly she didn't want to be there. Her comments after seem harsh and unhelpful.\n\nMuch more y.t.a.\n\nThe only people who say money doesnt matter are people who have money. It is an insane differentiator if you don't have it or grew up without.\n\nIt's fine if you grew up with similar people but not everyone grew up with a family Porsche. You're old enough that you should realize that by now.\n\nBut it boils down to your friend being clearly uncomfortable with a situation/context which it seems like you understand, but are actively choosing to ignore/dismiss because it doesn't fit your internal narrative.", "YTA \n\n\u201cOhhh but everyone has a Porsche sooooo\u2026\u201d\n\nYou definitely like to show people you are better off!

I dated a guy years ago that grew up wealthy who would try to drag me off to designer stores to shop. He walked into them already wearing designer, with confidence and was treated very differently than when I went in on my own to browse. The staff absolutely know who is in there to buy and who can only afford to browse, and the treatment you get is very different.", "YTA\n\nLet her stand in the snow if she wants. Tif&Co is set up to make people of her class uncomfortable, and she would have been uncomfortable there. I too would rather stand in the snow than suffer the humiliation of being kicked out or accussed of stealing, things which do happen to the less wealthy in places like that.\n\nIf someone I know told that Porsche story, I too would make a snide comment about the bourgeois. That story is an obscene display of wealth. Also she asked you for help buying groceries (not in a nice way, sure), and you not only refused, but held it against her. Just pay for the eggs, you have enough money for three lifetimes, right?\n\nYou saying you don't care about people's background, whether they're rich or privileged means nothing until you take active steps to make the less privileged comfortable in your prescence.", "\u201cI don\u2019t need no sugar daddy\u2026\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay in school.  \ud83d\ude44", "Oh. It looks like you have absolutely no clue how 90% of people actually live, to be honest.\n\nStory about driving Porsches on the maximum speed and not being fined is about wealth. It's about rich kid's entertainment that *breaks the law* and them not having to deal with consequences of breaking the law *because their parents are rich* and they are driving expensive cars in rich (and not over policed) neighborhood. You literally told a story about your peers showing off wealth and breaking the law, and endangering other people's lives FOR FUN, and you are surprised that she made *a snide comment*?\n\nAlso... Maybe she *is* rude sometimes. Maybe it's inconvenient for you to accommodate her insecurities. Maybe she isn't even a nice person. Maybe you don't want to deal with comments about your wealth. All of it doesn't make comments about stop-this-poor-people-shit and \"leave your inferiority complex\" okay. It is punching down and mean even if she was rude to you previously.\n\n When she didn't want to go inside the store she didn't stop you from doing it. You could go without her or stay with her, either way there's absolutely no need to comment on her class, complexes or whatever.", "YTA.\n\nI agree that Amy asking you to pay for eggs and judging you for eating out is not right, but for this situation alone, YTA. \n\nAmy didn\u2019t actually say why she didn\u2019t want to enter the store, she only said no. She didn\u2019t complain, or make any comment about poor people not being able enter luxury stores. That was all your own judgment based on how you see Amy as a person. What you said was inflammatory and unkind, and it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t understand how life is different when you don\u2019t have parents with enough money \u201cfor three lifetimes\u201d.", "this is complex but yes, YTA \n\nyou may not realize it but you remind Amy every day of what she doesn\u2019t have / hasn\u2019t had \n\nand those reminders and those missed experiences are more detrimental to her in the long run than her snide remarks are to you \n\nyou\u2019re experiencing her anger and that sucks \u2026 not the way growing up poor sucks though \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some other kind of oppression you\u2019ve experienced that maybe you can use as a comparison but basically the experience of oppression is always worse than the anger that sometimes get directed at the privileged. Young women don\u2019t always get the full experience of sexism (that tends to impact you extra as you enter to the workforce) but if you have had a taste of that you can try and think of it that way.\n\nYou could walk away from Amy if you wanted to. She can\u2019t walk away from poverty. And going to a place like Tiffany\u2019s is being confronted with that in a big way. You can casually buy expensive jewelry as a gift. She\u2019s not had that experience. She\u2019s trying to keep up and tag along but it\u2019s prob mega stressful for her to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s not an inferiority complex - she\u2019s grappling with the complexities of trying to make friends she can\u2019t keep up with financially, prob dealing with college over all which is expensive, and not quite sure how to talk about it with people she likes but who clearly don\u2019t understand her POV.\n\nYou\u2019re both young and college is the first time a lot of people meet people who are very different from them. You\u2019re likely to meet a lot of people in your life who don\u2019t see Porsches and Tiffany\u2019s as mundane experiences. If you can, use this as a chance to learn. Learning how to relate better to people who aren\u2019t like you is one of the best things college has to offer.", "ESH.\n\nYou were rude, but I'd lay money on it that had you not encouraged your friend to go into the shop, she would have told everyone you left a poor person standing in the snow while you burned \u00a350 notes and laughed in her face. \n\nYour friend was being silly, she may feel uncomfortable around expensive things, but that something she has to get over. And constantly making reference to her family's lack of wealth, or asking you to pay for things because yours are wealthy, is not going to make her feel better.\n\nHOWEVER, you need to tone down the rich girl stories. That's a lesson for life. They can make you sound obnoxious.", "ESH.\n\nIf you hadn't said the thing about the inferiority complex, you wouldn't have done any harm IMO.\n\nThe thing is, from what you described, she has obviously been put down in the past for her lack of wealth. I mean where do you think one gets an inferiority complex in the first place?\n\nYou could have just said if that's what you wanna do, and left her standing there.", "I'm honestly confused about these comments. All of you are judging her because she was born wealthy while preaching she should be more understanding and open towards Amy. Why doesn't it go both ways? Why is it that those who are born poor / have a disability / different sexuality get to be assholes without consequences but the second you are white and born in to a middle class / rich family, you're an asshole? \n\nWhy is it that OP has to completly change the way of living her life just to accomodate one person? I mean like she said in the comments, it's not about Amy asking for small financial help (eggs), it's the way she does it. Just because she had an unfortunate upbringing, doesn't justify her being an asshole. And honestly, i would also not entertain someone so demanding judging in my life, no matter how open minden and helpful i am.\n\nSo yes, it is important to listen to each other and expand our views but that doesn't mean we should accept being shitted on for something we can't do anything about.\n\nThis is how low is.

We took the bus to the food bank and held down multiple jobs while in school so we could crawl out of poverty. Now I\u2019m a nurse and make decent money, but I also only work part time because I\u2019m GREAT at money management after been poor for so long. I have had friends make snide comments about being \u201crich\u201d and how I should pay for things, and I just shut them down fast. We\u2019ve always been super generous with our money even when we were poor but were surprised to see how many people felt entitled to our generosity once we started making livable wages\u2026 it\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019d like to give out of the kindness of my heart, not because people expect it of me. Plus, I\u2019m a part time ski instructor and a part time nurse, and my husband is a ski instructor, we\u2019re living OUR personal dream, but would still be considered either upper lower class or lower middle class.

She has a chip on her shoulder and instead of wanting to get over it in order to enjoy life she is content to bring others down to her level.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are definitely some instances where you should share your privilege with her (I'm not saying you don't, I just don't know), like, offering to pay for her meal at a fancy restaurant so that you can enjoy one of life's pleasures together. But not wanting to come into the store with you, that was dumb.

She knew Pam wanted to shop at Tiffany's but agreed to go anyway. She could have just refused on account of being uncomfortable.

Like, I really think she\u2019s a lot more well-off than she makes herself out to be (has a car for herself, multiple pieces of jewelry, a pretty nice mid-high end luxury bag, and is also going to our college with no debt and not full scholarship). Heck, she has more clothes in her closet than me. She sends me so many mixed signals, I don\u2019t understand.", "Honestly the thing that tips OP into asshole territory for me is the way she punched down during the argument. I also would hate it if someone made snide comments about my (relatively privileged) upbringing but I can never ever imagine telling someone with less money 'you have an inferiority complex' and 'my parents will make more than yours would in 3 lifetimes'. Like that last comment is so hurtful and telling of OPs mindset it was a disgusting thing to say. \n\nAlso, to me nothing her friend did was that terrible. It was a bit cheeky to ask for OP to pay for eggs but imo it is way more embarrassing of OP, a very financially privileged individual to be counting pennies and insisting her friend with a total income of 36k pays equally. Ironically it is always rich people who are miserly like this. And why even tell the Porsche story if not to make fun of rich people?

I paid my way or I didn\u2019t go because I had friends at my level of poor you could say? that I would hang out with. I think if what the OP side is telling us is true, then there is more to Amy\u2019s mentality of poor victim hood.", ">Was she one of the kids with a Porsche?\n\nWouldn't be surprised!", "I appreciate some of the details were incorrect, but the cost of the cars still matters. The fact that these people feel they can be so reckless with objects that **again** cost more than Amy's family's yearly income is a fundamental part of the issue and I'm surprised you can't see that. \n\nPlease consider the main point of my original comment and try to understand things from Amy's perspective.", "What you did with that comment was remind her that poor people can\u2019t do what rich people can do. For example, when I used to drive a shitty $500 car I would get pulled over for everything and cops treated me like shit. A couple years ago my parents moved cross country and sold me their car for a good price, this car is a basic white lady car and looks MUCH nicer than my old car. It was still only a couple grand, but it has the appearance of a bit of money to it. I rarely get pulled over now and when I do cops are super nice. Your comment reminded her of your privilege and her struggles.", "And your story further highlighted what a discrepancy between rich and poor there is. For Amy having her car towed would have been a major thing, not jsut because of the inconvenience, but the cost would have had a major impact on her family. Your friends racing their cars without care for the consequences highlights just how privileged you are compared to her. Not only did the rich kids get away with driving in an incredibly dangerous and selfish way that could have cost other people their lives, whilst Amy suffered considerably for what was probably just a minor parking offense, they didn't even care about getting caught as for your friends, the fine would have little impact on your lives. You're kinda being purposely ignorant of the difference your privilege allows you.", "Privilege can basically be boiled down having a choice about whether you want to think about something or not. \n\nStraight people can choose whether to engage with homophobia. They can ignore it if they want to.\n\nAble bodied people don\u2019t have to check for wheelchair ramps. \n\nWhite people can choose to be anti racism but if they\u2019d rather not bother, they can just not. \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable confronting your privilege and realizing that other people don\u2019t have what you have through no fault of their own. And that you\u2019re basically just lucky that you were born who you are. \n\nYou can absolutely choose to stay emotionally comfortable and tune Amy out. Wealth gives you that ability. But more of the world is like Amy than like you and you\u2019ll wind up a more open minded, kinder human being if take the opportunity to learn how to sit with the discomfort of how unfair life is.", "You should spend time around people of different backgrounds and do more listening/less talking.  You seem to have lived both a privileged and sheltered life.", ">comfortable enough in her own skin\n\nThis isn\u2019t about her having an inferiority complex or low self esteem. Poor people live under a constant onslaught of social scrutiny and stigma that make a trip through somewhere like Tiffany\u2019s a minefield. Everything from the feeling of being unwelcome to the discomfort of seeing people casually buying things that cost more than your whole family could scrape together in a year. \n\nESH", "*she expressed she didnt want to go but was pressured in to going anyway*  . Read the whole thread. Peer pressure is a mf when you're 18", "Was she wearing the necklace that day? Maybe her necklace is fake and she didn\u2019t want the salespeople to see it, realize, and expose her.", "Privilege doesn\u2019t confer class - and neither does poverty.", "At the end of the day you don't know her entire story. Maybe that piece of jewelry wasn't passed down to her and holds more sentimental value than could ever be price matched? Maybe that clutch is a knock off? You don't dictate people's history. I left home and graduated a US Marine with a watch my parents clearly couldn't afford without help and had a rather pricey ( currently)  silver lighter that was my grandfather's . Parents do alot, more than is required sometimes, to ensure their kids don't feel the same level of despair as they did. You don't know the debt they took on for her to go to school where she does. Whether that's getting a second job, asking for help, extra shifts and going to bed hungry. We do it. You'll probably do it if you decide to have kids later on. Don't judge harshly on outward appearance alone. You don't really know their whole story, unless they decide to share it with you. That sideways smirk? That was embarrassed guilt awkwardly hoping you might help out .  Yes, it came off wrong but Imagine yourself without the means to make a morning meal for yourself. Really imagine it. How easy would it be for you to ask someone? Would you be completely honest and lay it all out, or would you try to retain some dignity and fuck it up a bit?", "Only because of OPs age and limited life experience will lead me to believe this was simply unintentional ignorance. We can only hope they learn from this thread and gain some perspective.", "Um, she was the one that agreed to go. Pam asked who was interested, she said she was.", "Ah, I understand what you\u2019re saying. It has just always been such a simple part of my life that it really takes a minute to think outside of the box. College is really a bigger pool\u2026", "This. This. This. \nYou need to do some growing up", "Such an amazing comment! OP please read this. You say that you never care about the socioeconomic status of someone but that\u2019s a privilege. You don\u2019t need to care but Amy probably feels it in every other conversation. She is dealing with it in an annoying way, sure, but please be aware of your privileges", "No, read OP's comment. Pam asked who was interested and Amy said she was. No one forced her. She CHOSE to go shopping but decided to stand outside the shop while the other two girls did the shopping. If Amy said she didn't want to go shopping but OP/Pam pressures her to go in the first place, then they're TA. But no one did. At least that's what I understand from the post+comments.", "I hope so. Sadly, in my opinion, saying things like 'I don't care about class' while being insensitive about your friend's financial situation and gripping over eggs comes from ignorance...but directly comparing your parents' incomes in the way that OP did comes from malice.", "Oof especially considering getting your car towed is expensive :( \n\nThat might have been a p stressful experience for her.", "Also try to remember that for rich people, so many things aren't actually illegal, because the fines are just small change to them. Like the kids at your high school not giving a shit about potentially being landed with a speeding fine that could be 2 weeks groceries or even a month's rent, is such a glaring example of the kind of privilege that is hard for Amy to hear about. I can only imagine how much her family must have scrimped to afford her a car on 36k, and how stressful it must have been for her car to be towed...so I really don't blame her for calling out rich kids who don't seem to give a shit about cars that cost like 10 years of rent.", "I meant it when I said you're like this 'unintentionally', I don't think you're a 'bad person' based on this alone and I also think Amy could have approached this better (she could just have not come at all).\n\nBecause of your upbringing and the people you've previously socialised with you've never really had to understand what growing up low-income is like. I obviously don't know the specifics of Amy's life, but it's likely that her parents work *extremely* hard to scrape together enough to get by. And that's likely genuinely the best they can do. They won't ever have as much money as your family no matter how hard they work, and it's quite possible that they put in longer hours than your parents do. \n\nI'm not saying your parents 'do nothing' or have never worked hard, just that hard work doesn't really correlate to income. That said, the lowest income people in any organisation are generally doing the least attractive work, and a lot more of it. \n\nMany rich families hire cleaners and so on as well - does yours? Amy's parents have to do all of that themselves. That's effectively hours of extra work every week. \n\nThings that were trivial gifts for you growing up were unimaginable luxuries for her in loads of ways you might never have thought of. She may have never had an international holiday, for example.\n\nIt's not just long term though, it's day to day as well.Let's look more closely at the food example. Going out to eat or getting a takeout is an insignificant expense for you, and when you do cook you probably never need to worry about selecting ingredients or recipes based on price. Amy's family, by contrast, has to make decisions like that. Were those eggs the budget option, or were they top range ones? She was clumsy in that interaction, but even that tiny expense might have been significant to her, both in raw cost and though it consuming some of her food budget, which could be as low as $15 a week.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/) might be worth a look to get a bit of perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also worth bearing in mind that there are a *lot* more families like Amy's than there are families like yours. Have you ever heard the term 1%? It's that 1% of society has over 50% of the wealth. The other 50% is split between nineteen out of every twenty people.\n\nIt's not your 'fault' that you're rich, of course, but it's not her fault that she's poor either.\n\nI noticed that in another comment you say that you think she envies you. Again, I don't know her and I don't know how she thinks, but rather than assuming it's envy I'd consider that it could be anger at the injustice of income inequality. It might not even be 'about' you as much as you're a constant reminder of it while being (no offence) pretty clueless about what the reality of it means.", "Again... Read the whole thread. Amy said she didn't want to go and was leaned into to be there so she agreed.", "I try to have a more hopefull out look, regardless of my pragmatist nature", "Also it's quite possible that due to the income and connections the police turn a blind eye to what people in OP's community did with their cars.", "A little off topic on this particular thread but I think it ties in - not feeling comfortable going into a Tiffany\u2019s to just \u201cbrowse\u201d. A group of rich kids walk into that store with confidence that they should be there even if they don\u2019t buy anything. Growing up poor - you go into a store the clerks seem to just know you don\u2019t have money even on a good day and kick you out for not buying anything. You look \u201csuspicious \u201c and they make you feel like crap. Or even worse accuse you of wrong doing, therefore you just don\u2019t take the risk. \n\nOP can\u2019t even wrap her mind around being made to feel that way - she has a whole different set of societal rules engrained in her and hopefully college opens up her eyes a bit to just how different a privileged life is.", "Am I missing something? Because I can't see where it says Amy was coerced to go shopping in the first place. It says OP tried to pressure her into going into the store once they were already shopping. Please point me out to where it says Amy was pressured to go shopping? I'm not trying to be rude or dense. I'm just really not finding the part where Amy didn't want to go shopping but was forced to go.", "Honestly seeking advice, I don\u2019t get what I\u2019m supposed to say or act to her. I\u2019m not going to change myself for just Amy, but it seems like almost everything about me rubs her the wrong way. Am I just destined to only be friends with the rich or something? I sincerely don\u2019t get what I should do.", "Oof yeah \u2026 lots of layers to this \u2026", "Try being sincere and understanding. You don't have to fundamentally change who you are, just try to see things the way she might and be compassionate. The best friend I know I'll always have grew up much like you. I grew up much like her. They never pitied me, they asked how they can be a better brother to me ( were guys so it was more ' hey fuckstick, you doing ok? ' . Now that I am stable I tend to go out of my way to try to include those who wouldn't otherwise be able to do things to help them privately and respectfully. Not always financially, just supporting them in other ways.  You'll find there are people that take advantage of that. Just make sure you always know that if shit hits the fan they will be there for you as much as you're there for them. Never, ever let anyone paint them as less . Never make them feel less than.", "Honestly, learn to stop taking comments about your wealth so personally. When you grow up with financial privilege is it really that hard to take a bit of ribbing for being a rich girl? None of what your friend said seems out of pocket to me. Like the way you've explained it, she \n1. Referenced your wealth when buying eggs...doesn't seem like a terrible offence despite being cheeky\n2. Made a snide comment in response to a story you told about rich people and their Porsches...can't really blame her when you were the one who brought it up.\n3. Didn't want to go into a Tiffany store...for which you got mad at her???? \n\nI'm confused at how you're not seeing how you're inc the wrong here. Like the correct response to someone feeling insecure about going into a shop they feel too poor for is not 'you have an inferiority complex', it's 'understandable, you can totally change your mind but if not see you in a bit'", "I would say, try to think a little bit more about your context and audience. That isn't to say you need to censor yourself, but to realize that you may come off differently than you intend to; you might fair better at that by taking a moment beforehand to think about what you're saying. You don't need to change for Amy, but one of the points of college these days is precisely to put you in an arena where you get to know other people and be exposed to other points of view and other people's life experiences. That's part of how you learn. And if you don't grow from learning, you're kind of missing the point. \n\nFor example, can you see in retrospect why a casual comment about virtually everyone in your *high school* driving a Porsche might come off as privileged and/or boastful? Your new roommate might well be hypersensitive to matters of wealth and that's something she's going to have to work on, but you also need to be aware that you're coming off as pretty tone deaf.", "Apologize. Ask her if she\u2019s willing to talk about it and listen. If she\u2019s willing to stay friends, in the future try and find activities that are more accessible to her. \n\nIf you want to casually pop into Tiffany\u2019s on a regular basis, yes, you\u2019ll only be able to hang out with wealthy people. Most people end up hanging out with people of similar backgrounds to them because of exactly these reasons. Same reason not everyone has friends outside their race. \n\nIt is possible though if you care about someone enough to be actually empathetic to them and learn about where they\u2019re coming from.", "Also adding in, OP you say you don't care about class' but from a rich person who, to be blunt, seems completely unaware of her privilege, it gives the same energy as a white person who 'doesnt see colour.' \n\nAnd honestly, it seems like you care a lot more about class than you think you do. If you truly didn't care, you wouldn't have got defensive the first time someone in a lower income bracket called attention to rich people bs. Nothing Amy said until you said she had an inferiority complex' was really that personal, and yet you seem extremely defensive about the fact that your high school friends drove ridiculously expensive cars and the fact that you're rich. You took it so personally when she didn't want to go to Tiffany's that you said something really cruel. You have no idea why rich kids speeding in their sports cars with zero consequences is a class issue. Even your username is rishbish..wealth is obviously waaay more wrapped up your identity than you think."]}
