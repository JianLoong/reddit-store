We split when she was 4 months old and he's always had primary custody and I've had visitation every weekend. Last year we switched from having visits to me having her on weekends. \n\nMy daughter has anxiety, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, dyspraxia, and developmental and speech delays. When I started having her on weekends, her stepmom would send her with this huge 3 inch binder with her daily routine, morning routine, bedtime routine, foods she likes, foods to avoid, activities that are \"disability friendly\", activities to avoid, what to do when she has a meltdown, and pretty much anything she could think of regarding my kid. She really stressed the routine and said that she can't function without it. \n\nThe thing is, she stays home with my daughter all day and I'm a working mom with 3 more kids under 5 years old. I can't guarantee we're going to eat at the same time every day. She goes to bed ridiculously early for a 10 year old and I can't do everything on the bedtime routine list and get her in bed on time. I shouldn't have to help her get dressed or do her hair in the mornings. She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nWe don't have a routine here and my daughter is doing just fine. I make her get herself ready in the mornings and ready for bed, we eat whenever I cook and most of the time she eats, and when she has tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThe problem is my ex and my daughter's stepmom swear that these weekends are stressing her out. They say that Sunday nights and Mondays have been rough for all of them, that she hasn't been able to be in normal classes on Mondays (she is in both special ed and normal classes), and that she's been getting sent home on Mondays because of behavior issues a lot more than when we just did visits. \n\nI know it's my kid's stepmom behind this. She's the one babying my kid to this extent and has criticized how I run my house nonstop since I got my daughter on weekends but it's also my ex's fault for buying into this and agreeing to go to court to try to reduce my custody. \n\nAnyways I wanted to know if I was the ass for not having a routine because my ex's wife is acting like I'm a horrible parent because of it.", "created_utc": 1681747424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pmzhi/aita_for_not_following_my_daughters_routine_at_my/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The people who have been raising her for the last decade do know her, and they know her routines, diagnoses and limitations. \n\nOf course they are going to try to reduce your custody.

I think it's sick you're preventing your daughter from doing stuff that works for her because you're vindictive and bitter.", "YTA  \nI understand the reasons you have stated for not being able to adhere to a routine, but it also sounds like you have very little regard for your daughter's abilities, limitations, and feelings. It sounds like her step-mom spends more time with her and clearly cares about her well-being.\n\nYou clearly have more on your plate, but you should also ask yourself why you don't care to try?", "YTA. It's easy to not notice the lasting effects of your decisions when you're not the one dealing with them.

You obviously don\u2019t grasp the idea that your daughter is her own person, with her own needs and wants.

I don't understand how you can type out what you just did without feeling any sort of shame or embarrassment at your behaviour towards your eldest child.\n\nI'm so happy to hear that your daughters father and stepmother are the awesome parents that your child deserves.\n\nYou should be learning from them, nit bad mouthing them.", "Info: Do you ever have contact with any of her doctors or therapists?

I only have ADHD and I have to force myself to have a routine, otherwise I completely go to pieces. The structures you're putting in place now will help her throughout her life.  \n\nI can understand that it's hard with work and other kids to look after, but if the normal routine is too much, how about sitting down with her and coming up with a routine for when she's with you? She might need a bit of extra help to get into it at first, but it might reassure her and give her the structure she needs. It's not ideal but it would be better than nothing. It would at least show that you understand her and that you care. \n\nAlso, I'm sure I won't be the only one to mention it,  but ADHD and dyspraxia get passed down (don't know about SPD). Either you or her dad are likely to have it. Time to read up on it, because it might be that you could do with more structure as well - and that goes for your other kids too.", "You have a disabled daughter you are causing harm to by trying to force not to be disabled.

Doing things you NORMALLY \"shouldn't\" have to do because the situation isn't normal. \n\n>tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThese are not tantrums, nor are they misbehavior.

Let her stay home with the people who are willing to love and care for her unconditionally. That's a real family. YTA", "YTA. You literally listed all the developmental issues with your daughter and then refuse to do any of the work to help her. That schedule and order is there for HER so she thrives when she is at home and away. \n\nYou disrupting it means your ex and his wife have to deal with the fallout. Further you compare your child to your oldest who does not have ANY of the issues your eldest does. That is Apples to oranges. \n\nMaybe sit down with your daughters therapist or workers to better understand her conditions. You clearly have no interest in helping her and need to re consider the weekends with her until you can. \n\nThis is detrimental to HER well being and health.", "YTA--\nYour daughter might seem like she's doing okay, but she's holding it together.  Those are not tantrums. Those are meltdowns.\n\nLook up restraint collapse.  Usually school restraint collapse.\n\nBasically a kiddo will keep it together, then once they are safe at home they let it all out.  And it's horribly hard on them.\n\nSo yes, your child might seem fine to you even though you're breaking their schedule, when they are at their primary caregivers house, likely that they are feeling the effects.", "YTA. Mainly to your firstborn, but also because you can\u2019t realize that having a functioning routine is incredibly beneficial to your 3 OTHER CHILDREN UNDER 5 as well. I was a single mom while my children were small and know the chaos of varying work schedules etc but at the very least some level of food/bath/set bedtime will improve your life and theirs. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re unwilling to do this basic thing for your special-needs time makes me think you should go back to visitation only and or take a class on parenting a special-needs child (I\u2019m honestly surprised that wasn\u2019t required if your custody agreement only allowed you daytime visitation previously). \nYou\u2019re willfully hindering your daughters development.", "YTA. Your daughter needs structure.  You are given a specific and detailed plan and \u201care too busy\u201d to follow it.  You think you know better- you don\u2019t.  Get on board or give up your weekends.  You are doing your child a disservice", "YTA. As soon as I heard you dismiss the stepmother by calling the daughter YOUR kid, I realized you were an asshole. You had VISITATION, and just got the right to see her on the weekends, there is a reason for that. Stepmother is hugely invested in \"your daughters\" care and you see that as some kind of burden. YTA.", "If your kids are all little, an early bedtime for everyone helps rather than hurts.  Yes, your eldest daughter may be able to do more on her own than she's expected to, but just because your younger kid can do things doesn't mean your eldest can.\n\nIt's hard to give a judgement without knowing exactly what the routine is.\n\nFor example, as a teenager I babysat for a family whose bedtime routine including rocking and singing the children to sleep.  Except that for their family this meant Spanish and Italian opera. That bedtime routine was painful.  Their mother was a professional soprano with an impressive range.  I'm an alto with a very limited range.  After their parents got home, the youngest child tried to pay me with candy to never sang to her again.\n\nThat's the kind of routine that can't possibly work for everyone, even if it was absolutely cherished by that family.\n\nOn the other hand are very reasonable routines that include making sure all the children in the household are fed, in bed early enough for each child, and have the help they need.  Your eldest may always need a little extra help or she may not, but going from an only child life to the eldest of 4 has to be very stressful for her, especially if she doesn't have an easy way to let you know when she needs a break, is feeling overwhelmed, or just needs to express emotions safely.", "Your daughter has lived primarily with your ex for all of her life and yet you somehow think you know better than your ex and his wife when it comes to your daughter? \n\nYou absolutely don't, as this post clearly demonstrates. \n\nI'd bet every last dollar in my bank account that those \"tantrums\" (as you call them) are actually meltdowns due to her change in routine and would greatly reduce if you actually made an effort to do the things her primary parents know to be best. \n\nEven if you can't do all of it, I'm guessing you could at least do some of those things in SOME way. Yes, you work, but you only have your daughter 1-2 nights per week - is it not worth it to you to at least *try* some of those things to see if they help her? \n\nYTA.", "YTA and causing incredible harm.

For a child that needs a structured routine, tossing to out the window because you're too busy when she's with you is not the answer.\n\nYou all co-parent this child  You need to find a compromise routine that you may adhere to so your daughter does not have a meltdown when she returns from your home.  It requires give and take and an honest discussion. No one can go into this discussion with a chip on their shoulder and insisting person X's way is the only way.", "YTA.

He gets their son all stressed and upset on the weekends and leaves her to handle the fall out on Monday. You're trying to hurt your ex, but you're hurting your kid.

She\u2019s just masking as well as she can until she gets home to her safe space and can let out her true feelings.  My daughter has some anxiety and does the same thing at school all day then releases her pent-up emotions when she gets home.\n\nAll kids benefit from some semblance of a routine so it wouldn\u2019t hurt your other 3 children to at least attempt to try it on weekends.", "YTA for your attitude. I get that with 3 kids who are under 5, you just don't have the time to do all the stuff that your ex and his wife do since they can concentrate on just one child. The thing is, that as a parent, it's your job to assess the situation and really think through the effect this is having on your daughter. \n\nIf you can't handle whole weekends when she still needs this much support that you are unable to provide, maybe it would be better if she visited you during the day and didn't stay the whole weekend. \n\nAlso, maybe she could be more independent if it was introduced into her routine carefully, but at the moment you are doing more harm than good by having such different expectations in your house.

I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not doing your best, but your attitude is not the same as a loving concerned parent would have. She has a routine and if she isn\u2019t able to brush her own hair like your 4 year old, is because she is not your 4 year old. Stop comparing. You said yourself she is diagnosed with a lot of things, including development delay. It\u2019s expected of her to not be able to do the same as her other siblings. My advice to you is: if you are busy and can\u2019t keep up with her routine, PLEASE, put her best interest in your heart and give up this custody agreement. Go back to visits only if you care for her well being.", "YTA.  You\u2019re only thinking of what is best for you and your current family and dismissing valid concerns by the people primarily taking care of your biological daughter.  Your biological daughter is lucky to have parents that actually prioritize her needs.

You shouldn\u2019t have unsupervised visitation/time with your biological daughter if this is how you act and think.", "Yes. YTA. Your daughter is not being \"babied\", she's being accommodated because of her disabilities. You have a disabled child. Do you understand that? She isn't going to be able to behave \"normally\" like your other three children, and you are actively harming her by ignoring her routine.

She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nDo you not understand what developmental delays are? Ye gods, OP, you could try to pretend you care about your child. She's not a neurotypical kid.

We split when she was 4 months old and he's always had primary custody and I've had visitation every weekend. Last year we switched from having visits to me having her on weekends. \n\nMy daughter has anxiety, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, dyspraxia, and developmental and speech delays. When I started having her on weekends, her stepmom would send her with this huge 3 inch binder with her daily routine, morning routine, bedtime routine, foods she likes, foods to avoid, activities that are \"disability friendly\", activities to avoid, what to do when she has a meltdown, and pretty much anything she could think of regarding my kid. She really stressed the routine and said that she can't function without it. \n\nThe thing is, she stays home with my daughter all day and I'm a working mom with 3 more kids under 5 years old. I can't guarantee we're going to eat at the same time every day. She goes to bed ridiculously early for a 10 year old and I can't do everything on the bedtime routine list and get her in bed on time. I shouldn't have to help her get dressed or do her hair in the mornings. She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nWe don't have a routine here and my daughter is doing just fine. I make her get herself ready in the mornings and ready for bed, we eat whenever I cook and most of the time she eats, and when she has tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThe problem is my ex and my daughter's stepmom swear that these weekends are stressing her out. They say that Sunday nights and Mondays have been rough for all of them, that she hasn't been able to be in normal classes on Mondays (she is in both special ed and normal classes), and that she's been getting sent home on Mondays because of behavior issues a lot more than when we just did visits. \n\nI know it's my kid's stepmom behind this. She's the one babying my kid to this extent and has criticized how I run my house nonstop since I got my daughter on weekends but it's also my ex's fault for buying into this and agreeing to go to court to try to reduce my custody. \n\nAnyways I wanted to know if I was the ass for not having a routine because my ex's wife is acting like I'm a horrible parent because of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you can\u2019t reasonably meet those basics, if the visits are creating additional stress for your 10 year old and bringing her, you, and her siblings closer together, then look at how to do time with her differently. Maybe go back to the old system. Maybe something else.\n\nYou are clearly working hard to balance everything in your life. Take a breath. Accept and work to understand the ways your 10 year old is neurologically different.  Then look at her again. She is a whole innocent person, who, through no fault of her own, processes the world differently.  Love her, and love that part of her, enough to see that she gets what *she* needs.", "I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb, and say that you don\u2019t actually believe that your daughter has these diagnosis\u2019s and think her step mom is just being over dramatic.

For the benefit of this poor girl, you should go back to only visitations.", "NTA - I think its great that you, although more as a matter of circumstance than anything else, are pushing your daughter towards greater independence. Your daughter won't have parents to take care of her forever, and yes, while she has special needs, at some point she needs to learn how to operate independently as it seems that she does have the capability to do so to some extent.", "YTA.

You are an absolute, huge, gigantic, YTA.", "As someone with anxiety and autism who used to have to have my routine upended by having to spend weekends at my dad's house, I can say with a lot of certainty that you are the problem here. Your actions are hurting your child and what you are doing is definitely what is causing her so much stress on Mondays. She is not having tantrums when she's with you, she's having meltdowns, and you are exacerbating the entire situation with her flagrant refusal to properly accommodate your child's needs.

Totally get why ex has the primary custody and it should stay that way", "I just want to add on that you telling her to \u201cgo to her room until she can behave\u201d is so psychologically damaging.

I am a mom of two kids with autism and adhd and anxiety. What a lot of people don't understand is that they cannot do things other kids their age can. As parents we carry them - a lot. And it takes a lot of time to get them to be self-sufficient. More time than for neurotypical kids.\n\nIt is our job as parents to take care of our kids. OP apparently doesn't want to. Good thing that the daughter has her stepmum.", "Common for what kind of kids being in stressed situations? She seems to acknowledge that her child has a lot of different diagnoses.

She has brushed off the instructions as too hard. If OP can't follow the binder, she can't properly care for her daughter. The little girl does not deserve to be treated this way.", "Also, a strong routine that includes everyone in the household is very important when you have multiple little ones and an older kid with higher needs.\n\nYou need to figure out a routine that includes your eldest without expecting her to take on new tasks or skills she doesn't do at her dad's house and that gives her the support she expects and *needs*.

She is a huge asshole. She\u2019s a terrible mother.", "Sounds to me like stepmom DOES have it all figured out. She\u2019s raising a child with complex, intersecting disabilities and has worked out a system that allows her to both learn effectively with special ed and still be able to spend time in a classroom with her neurotypical peers. It\u2019s likely involved hundreds of hours of doctor and specialist visits, advocacy with the school, IEP meetings, etc all for OP to dismiss it as \u2018babying\u2019 and fuck it all up on a weekly basis. She deserves all the credit in the world for how she\u2019s stepped up for this child.", "I see this perspective, but OP's attitude is so dismissive that I personally can't judge her to be anything other than asshole here.\n\nShe doesn't even seem to be trying to understand anything that her ex and his wife are saying, instead just deciding that they're \"babying\" the daughter as a way to keep control even in the face of considerable evidence to the contrary. \n\nIf OP and her ex had something approaching 50/50 custody, and OP's daughter was truly fine at OP's house during OP's half of the week, then I'd say that there's perhaps some validity in OP's perspective.

I'm shocked at how many people rushed to Y T A without considering any of the nuances here.", "The step mom has been the primary caretaker of her daughter for all this time.
