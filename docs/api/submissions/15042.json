We split when she was 4 months old and he's always had primary custody and I've had visitation every weekend. Last year we switched from having visits to me having her on weekends. \n\nMy daughter has anxiety, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, dyspraxia, and developmental and speech delays. When I started having her on weekends, her stepmom would send her with this huge 3 inch binder with her daily routine, morning routine, bedtime routine, foods she likes, foods to avoid, activities that are \"disability friendly\", activities to avoid, what to do when she has a meltdown, and pretty much anything she could think of regarding my kid. She really stressed the routine and said that she can't function without it. \n\nThe thing is, she stays home with my daughter all day and I'm a working mom with 3 more kids under 5 years old. I can't guarantee we're going to eat at the same time every day. She goes to bed ridiculously early for a 10 year old and I can't do everything on the bedtime routine list and get her in bed on time. I shouldn't have to help her get dressed or do her hair in the mornings. She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nWe don't have a routine here and my daughter is doing just fine. I make her get herself ready in the mornings and ready for bed, we eat whenever I cook and most of the time she eats, and when she has tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThe problem is my ex and my daughter's stepmom swear that these weekends are stressing her out. They say that Sunday nights and Mondays have been rough for all of them, that she hasn't been able to be in normal classes on Mondays (she is in both special ed and normal classes), and that she's been getting sent home on Mondays because of behavior issues a lot more than when we just did visits. \n\nI know it's my kid's stepmom behind this. She's the one babying my kid to this extent and has criticized how I run my house nonstop since I got my daughter on weekends but it's also my ex's fault for buying into this and agreeing to go to court to try to reduce my custody. \n\nAnyways I wanted to know if I was the ass for not having a routine because my ex's wife is acting like I'm a horrible parent because of it.", "created_utc": 1681747424, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pmzhi/aita_for_not_following_my_daughters_routine_at_my/", "score": 1663, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The people who have been raising her for the last decade do know her, and they know her routines, diagnoses and limitations. \n\nOf course they are going to try to reduce your custody.

I think it's sick you're preventing your daughter from doing stuff that works for her because you're vindictive and bitter.", "YTA  \nI understand the reasons you have stated for not being able to adhere to a routine, but it also sounds like you have very little regard for your daughter's abilities, limitations, and feelings. It sounds like her step-mom spends more time with her and clearly cares about her well-being.\n\nYou clearly have more on your plate, but you should also ask yourself why you don't care to try?", "YTA. It's easy to not notice the lasting effects of your decisions when you're not the one dealing with them.

You obviously don\u2019t grasp the idea that your daughter is her own person, with her own needs and wants. She is not your other kids, she has special needs. \nYour ex and her new wife seem very dedicated to this child as an individual, meanwhile you drag them through the mud because you want to generalize your children as self sufficient? That\u2019s just ignorant and hateful. \nHonestly this whole post reminds me of my own mother. And that\u2019s def not a good thing.", "YTA. I don't understand how you can type out what you just did without feeling any sort of shame or embarrassment at your behaviour towards your eldest child.\n\nI'm so happy to hear that your daughters father and stepmother are the awesome parents that your child deserves.\n\nYou should be learning from them, nit bad mouthing them.", "Info: Do you ever have contact with any of her doctors or therapists?

I only have ADHD and I have to force myself to have a routine, otherwise I completely go to pieces. The structures you're putting in place now will help her throughout her life.  \n\nI can understand that it's hard with work and other kids to look after, but if the normal routine is too much, how about sitting down with her and coming up with a routine for when she's with you? She might need a bit of extra help to get into it at first, but it might reassure her and give her the structure she needs. It's not ideal but it would be better than nothing. It would at least show that you understand her and that you care. \n\nAlso, I'm sure I won't be the only one to mention it,  but ADHD and dyspraxia get passed down (don't know about SPD). Either you or her dad are likely to have it. Time to read up on it, because it might be that you could do with more structure as well - and that goes for your other kids too.", "You have a disabled daughter you are causing harm to by trying to force not to be disabled.

Doing things you NORMALLY \"shouldn't\" have to do because the situation isn't normal. \n\n>tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThese are not tantrums, nor are they misbehavior. Sounds like she's having an autistic meltdowns, and you're punishing her and isolating her for them. Just face it. You can't hack it as the parent of a disabled kid. Let her stay home with the people who are willing to love and care for her unconditionally. That's a real family. YTA", "YTA. You literally listed all the developmental issues with your daughter and then refuse to do any of the work to help her. That schedule and order is there for HER so she thrives when she is at home and away. \n\nYou disrupting it means your ex and his wife have to deal with the fallout. Further you compare your child to your oldest who does not have ANY of the issues your eldest does. That is Apples to oranges. \n\nMaybe sit down with your daughters therapist or workers to better understand her conditions. You clearly have no interest in helping her and need to re consider the weekends with her until you can. \n\nThis is detrimental to HER well being and health.", "YTA--\nYour daughter might seem like she's doing okay, but she's holding it together.  Those are not tantrums. Those are meltdowns.\n\nLook up restraint collapse.  Usually school restraint collapse.\n\nBasically a kiddo will keep it together, then once they are safe at home they let it all out.  And it's horribly hard on them.\n\nSo yes, your child might seem fine to you even though you're breaking their schedule, when they are at their primary caregivers house, likely that they are feeling the effects.", "YTA. Mainly to your firstborn, but also because you can\u2019t realize that having a functioning routine is incredibly beneficial to your 3 OTHER CHILDREN UNDER 5 as well. I was a single mom while my children were small and know the chaos of varying work schedules etc but at the very least some level of food/bath/set bedtime will improve your life and theirs. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re unwilling to do this basic thing for your special-needs child makes me think you should go back to visitation only and or take a class on parenting a special-needs child (I\u2019m honestly surprised that wasn\u2019t required if your custody agreement only allowed you daytime visitation previously). \nYou\u2019re willfully hindering your daughters development.\n\nETA missing word", "YTA. Your daughter needs structure.  You are given a specific and detailed plan and \u201care too busy\u201d to follow it.  You think you know better- you don\u2019t.  Get on board or give up your weekends.  You are doing your child a disservice", "YTA. As soon as I heard you dismiss the stepmother by calling the daughter YOUR kid, I realized you were an asshole. You had VISITATION, and just got the right to see her on the weekends, there is a reason for that. Stepmother is hugely invested in \"your daughters\" care and you see that as some kind of burden. YTA.", "If your kids are all little, an early bedtime for everyone helps rather than hurts.  Yes, your eldest daughter may be able to do more on her own than she's expected to, but just because your younger kid can do things doesn't mean your eldest can.\n\nIt's hard to give a judgement without knowing exactly what the routine is.\n\nFor example, as a teenager I babysat for a family whose bedtime routine including rocking and singing the children to sleep.  Except that for their family this meant Spanish and Italian opera. That bedtime routine was painful.  Their mother was a professional soprano with an impressive range.  I'm an alto with a very limited range.  After their parents got home, the youngest child tried to pay me with candy to never sang to her again.\n\nThat's the kind of routine that can't possibly work for everyone, even if it was absolutely cherished by that family.\n\nOn the other hand are very reasonable routines that include making sure all the children in the household are fed, in bed early enough for each child, and have the help they need.  Your eldest may always need a little extra help or she may not, but going from an only child life to the eldest of 4 has to be very stressful for her, especially if she doesn't have an easy way to let you know when she needs a break, is feeling overwhelmed, or just needs to express emotions safely.", "Your daughter has lived primarily with your ex for all of her life and yet you somehow think you know better than your ex and his wife when it comes to your daughter? \n\nYou absolutely don't, as this post clearly demonstrates. \n\nI'd bet every last dollar in my bank account that those \"tantrums\" (as you call them) are actually meltdowns due to her change in routine and would greatly reduce if you actually made an effort to do the things her primary parents know to be best. \n\nEven if you can't do all of it, I'm guessing you could at least do some of those things in SOME way. Yes, you work, but you only have your daughter 1-2 nights per week - is it not worth it to you to at least *try* some of those things to see if they help her? \n\nYTA.", "YTA and causing incredible harm.

For a child that needs a structured routine, tossing to out the window because you're too busy when she's with you is not the answer.\n\nYou all co-parent this child  You need to find a compromise routine that you may adhere to so your daughter does not have a meltdown when she returns from your home.  It requires give and take and an honest discussion. No one can go into this discussion with a chip on their shoulder and insisting person X's way is the only way.", "YTA.

He gets their son all stressed and upset on the weekends and leaves her to handle the fall out on Monday. You're trying to hurt your ex, but you're hurting your kid.

She\u2019s just masking as well as she can until she gets home to her safe space and can let out her true feelings.  My daughter has some anxiety and does the same thing at school all day then releases her pent-up emotions when she gets home.\n\nAll kids benefit from some semblance of a routine so it wouldn\u2019t hurt your other 3 children to at least attempt to try it on weekends.", "YTA for your attitude. I get that with 3 kids who are under 5, you just don't have the time to do all the stuff that your ex and his wife do since they can concentrate on just one child. The thing is, that as a parent, it's your job to assess the situation and really think through the effect this is having on your daughter. \n\nIf you can't handle whole weekends when she still needs this much support that you are unable to provide, maybe it would be better if she visited you during the day and didn't stay the whole weekend. \n\nAlso, maybe she could be more independent if it was introduced into her routine carefully, but at the moment you are doing more harm than good by having such different expectations in your house. Talk to your ex and his wife. Be open to do better.", "YTA. Honestly, your daughter has special needs. Gladly, her dad and stepmom do their best to fit in her needs. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not doing your best, but your attitude is not the same as a loving concerned parent would have. She has a routine and if she isn\u2019t able to brush her own hair like your 4 year old, is because she is not your 4 year old. Stop comparing. You said yourself she is diagnosed with a lot of things, including development delay. It\u2019s expected of her to not be able to do the same as her other siblings. My advice to you is: if you are busy and can\u2019t keep up with her routine, PLEASE, put her best interest in your heart and give up this custody agreement. Go back to visits only if you care for her well being.", "YTA.  You\u2019re only thinking of what is best for you and your current family and dismissing valid concerns by the people primarily taking care of your biological daughter.  Your biological daughter is lucky to have parents that actually prioritize her needs.  I get it, you have 3 other kids but the way you speak about your ex and his wife is absolutely vile and disrespectful.  You shouldn\u2019t have unsupervised visitation/time with your biological daughter if this is how you act and think.", "Yes. YTA. Your daughter is not being \"babied\", she's being accommodated because of her disabilities. You have a disabled child. Do you understand that? She isn't going to be able to behave \"normally\" like your other three children, and you are actively harming her by ignoring her routine.

She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nDo you not understand what developmental delays are? Ye gods, OP, you could try to pretend you care about your child. She's not a neurotypical kid.

We split when she was 4 months old and he's always had primary custody and I've had visitation every weekend. Last year we switched from having visits to me having her on weekends. \n\nMy daughter has anxiety, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, dyspraxia, and developmental and speech delays. When I started having her on weekends, her stepmom would send her with this huge 3 inch binder with her daily routine, morning routine, bedtime routine, foods she likes, foods to avoid, activities that are \"disability friendly\", activities to avoid, what to do when she has a meltdown, and pretty much anything she could think of regarding my kid. She really stressed the routine and said that she can't function without it. \n\nThe thing is, she stays home with my daughter all day and I'm a working mom with 3 more kids under 5 years old. I can't guarantee we're going to eat at the same time every day. She goes to bed ridiculously early for a 10 year old and I can't do everything on the bedtime routine list and get her in bed on time. I shouldn't have to help her get dressed or do her hair in the mornings. She's 10. My 4 year old can dress herself and brush her own hair. \n\nWe don't have a routine here and my daughter is doing just fine. I make her get herself ready in the mornings and ready for bed, we eat whenever I cook and most of the time she eats, and when she has tantrums she has to go to her room until she's ready to behave. \n\nThe problem is my ex and my daughter's stepmom swear that these weekends are stressing her out. They say that Sunday nights and Mondays have been rough for all of them, that she hasn't been able to be in normal classes on Mondays (she is in both special ed and normal classes), and that she's been getting sent home on Mondays because of behavior issues a lot more than when we just did visits. \n\nI know it's my kid's stepmom behind this. She's the one babying my kid to this extent and has criticized how I run my house nonstop since I got my daughter on weekends but it's also my ex's fault for buying into this and agreeing to go to court to try to reduce my custody. \n\nAnyways I wanted to know if I was the ass for not having a routine because my ex's wife is acting like I'm a horrible parent because of it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She's not recognizing that she's the issue here and not attempting to make changes or simply not engage until she can make changes.\n\nShes confused and in her confusion, blaming the person directly coming to her with concerns aka the stepmom.\n\nThat doesn't make OP a bad parent but it does mean she's currently neglecting her child.\n\nWe have to give parents room to learn and grow.", "OP was only allowed visitation with her child for the bulk of her life and has only recently been allowed to have extended time where her daughter is allowed to sleep over on weekends. \n\nThe only person who seems to be exaggerating here is OP. First off a 3 ring binder holds anywhere from 560 pages up to 750. I doubt she was given a 3 ring with over 500 pages of information. \n\nShe then went on to list 6 different medical & behavioral issues her child is getting treated for which included developmental and speech delays and yet still compared her to her 4 year old. She dropped that in the post like her daughter is spoiled, lazy and weaponizing incompetence as if the 6 diagnosis she has received don\u2019t create issues for her at all. \n\nSo she downplayed her daughters issues, exaggerated about the binder and conveniently left out a lot of details about what is going on in her house that makes the daughter so uncontrollable she\u2019s getting sent home the Monday immediately after being at OPs home. \n\nA change in routine is a major disruption in this child\u2019s life. Shes spending nights away from home sleeping at a place she normally only visits, trying to find a way to exist in a household that\u2019s totally different than what she\u2019s use to with other kids and personalities she hadn\u2019t previously spent that much time with. \n\nThe least that OP could do is use some of the information her ex has given her to facilitate an environment that will make her daughter feel a bit more comfortable instead of out of sorts, like she\u2019s doing. \n\nShe should have incorporated as much from that book as she reasonably could, and questioned the things she had doubts about and adjusted accordingly when necessary. \n\nOP seems to be willfully ignoring the special needs the 10 year old has just because."]}
