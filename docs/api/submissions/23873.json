{"id": 23873, "submission_id": "15i361l", "title": "AITA for getting upset when my (28M) girlfriend (25F) suggested we split the dinner bill?", "selftext": "\nFor context, this is a 4 year relationship and we live together. I pay for utilities, she buys groceries, we both split rent and pay for our personal bills on our own. We have a joint account where we save for a future home. Finances has never been a huge issue. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are not flat broke, but we are in a place where saving money is a priority. She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do. \n\nMy girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week. She takes me to places I like, or a place we both equally enjoy. She always offers to pay, I always let her. She\u2019s not like normal girls who does the check dance but still expects the man to pay. Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. I like when she takes me on dates, it makes me feel good about saving money. I have good food, she spends the whole evening asking about me, complimenting me, and planning our future. She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me. \n\nThe problem came up last night when she had a huge craving for appetizers and margaritas. She complained about spending her day off cleaning the entire kitchen and she didn\u2019t want to dirty any other dishes. She suggested we go out, and I didn\u2019t see a problem with it. We had a great meal. Between the two of us we had a few margaritas and the bill was adding up. Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget. \n\nThis is where I got confused. She invited me out to dinner, made the suggestion, and is insisting we split the check? I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays. Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me? \n\nWe had a small argument, she got really upset, paid the check, and we walked home without speaking. I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore, this suggestion or any other suggestions wasn\u2019t helpful. \n\nShe\u2019s been distant and incredibly upset and is now mentioning the weirdest problems and making me feel like a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. But we go out for dates every week? \n\nPlease let me know AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for wanting to split the check?\n\nEDIT: \nThis post hit me like a ton of bricks. I\u2019ve never felt so terrible about how I\u2019ve treated my partner. I was so hung up on the principle of her always paying for my meals, and suddenly changing the dynamic. \n\nI was so hung up on the idea of wanting to save money and being impressed albeit jealous of the fact she always had so much money saved. \n\nI have reached out to her with an apology, and have insisted that we have an at home date with a bottle of wine, our two laptops, and a budgeting spreadsheet so we can both be on the same page. \n\nI really admire how equitable she\u2019s been in the relationship, and have never had anyone treat me the way she does in a relationship. It felt so good to be taken care of, but as many of you painfully pointed out, IATA, and she deserves some reciprocity.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: \nI left work early, I called her mom, and while on FaceTime she helped me pick out a dress in her size. She got shoes delivered recently that she hasn\u2019t been able to wear yet. I\u2019m on the way to her job. \n\nShe\u2019s still at work, and still upset. My plan is to ask reception to send her downstairs to \u201cpick up a package\u201d where I will be with her favorite ice coffee. I have so much adrenaline and excitement. She gets off of work in 2 hours. I\u2019m going to pick up sunflowers (her favorite flower as it is tattooed up and down both her arms). I called and got us a table at a new Japanese fusion restaurant that she has been wanting to go to, but hasn\u2019t been my style. It\u2019s not important to me that my food options are limited. I can\u2019t be selfish with this woman anymore. \n\nI\u2019m going to lay her outfit out in the bedroom and tidy up the place as best I can with the time I have before she gets home. \n\nI won\u2019t let her down. I don\u2019t know how she hasn\u2019t left me yet, and I hope I can mend the damage my neglect has caused. \n\nI hope there will be a positive update in the future. She has no idea, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d expect any of these gestures. It\u2019s been so fun picking things out for her.

I pay for utilities, she buys groceries, we both split rent and pay for our personal bills on our own. We have a joint account where we save for a future home. Finances has never been a huge issue. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are not flat broke, but we are in a place where saving money is a priority. She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do. \n\nMy girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week. She takes me to places I like, or a place we both equally enjoy. She always offers to pay, I always let her. She\u2019s not like normal girls who does the check dance but still expects the man to pay. Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. I like when she takes me on dates, it makes me feel good about saving money. I have good food, she spends the whole evening asking about me, complimenting me, and planning our future. She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me. \n\nThe problem came up last night when she had a huge craving for appetizers and margaritas. She complained about spending her day off cleaning the entire kitchen and she didn\u2019t want to dirty any other dishes. She suggested we go out, and I didn\u2019t see a problem with it. We had a great meal. Between the two of us we had a few margaritas and the bill was adding up. Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget. \n\nThis is where I got confused. She invited me out to dinner, made the suggestion, and is insisting we split the check? I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays. Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me? \n\nWe had a small argument, she got really upset, paid the check, and we walked home without speaking. I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore, this suggestion or any other suggestions wasn\u2019t helpful. \n\nShe\u2019s been distant and incredibly upset and is now mentioning the weirdest problems and making me feel like a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. But we go out for dates every week? \n\nPlease let me know AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for wanting to split the check?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How entitled are you?", "WOW. Of course YTA.\n\nYou may be the biggest AH I've ever seen on here, if you're not a troll, because there's literally no way you think that we're actually buying this bullshit:\n\n>She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do.\n\nSo, you do realise that this is just another way of saying, \"I can't be arsed to budget and I spend irresponsibly, so it's fair to say that I never have as much money left as she does because of my refusal to take responsibility for myself. A theme that apparently carries throughout . . .\n\n>My girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week.  She always offers to pay, I always let her. \n\nWhy? Why do you always let her. Why do you not ever offer to pay? Do you not like her? Do you not think she deserves to be treated sometimes?\n\n>Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. \n\nI'll bet you do. I can't think of anyone who WOULDN'T think it was a nice perk to go out to dinner weekly at restaurants and never ever pay. But again, you haven't explained WHY you always let her pay and never offer to treat her. Ever.\n\n>Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget.\r  \n\n\nReasonable. She's paying every single time and you're letting her. She lets you know that she cannot afford this, asks for the nights out that you admit you enjoy to be made more equitable. And . . . THIS is how you respond . . .\n\n>I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. \n\nAgain, why? Do you not love her? Do you not think she deserves for you to do nice things for her the way she does for you?\n\n>She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of \n\nBecause you are literally taking advantage of her. You just admitted that if she didn't pay EVERY SINGLE TIME that you wouldn't take her out at all.\n\n>and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays.\n\nYou just said yourself that this is true. That if you had to pay, you just wouldn't go out with her.\n\n> Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me?\n\nI mean, but that's a flat-out lie. No one is asking you to pay for \"every single date\". She's asking you to pay for ANY dates, EVER. You are literally having a tantrum because she asked you to pay for HALF OF ONE DATE, not even a whole date, after she has paid for \"every single date\" for several years. What are you on about? And how is \"saving money . . . important to \\[you\\]\"? You just wrote above that she's the one who is good at budgeting and saving, and implied that you are shitty at saving and never have any money. So which is it? You're either lying about saving being important to you, or you were lying earlier that you're not good at saving. Either way you're lying to us.\n\n> I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore\n\nSo it's okay for her to pay for all of your dates, all of the time . . .but if she asks you to pay for half of a date, much less pay for an occasional entire meal, you throw your toys out the pram and decide you just won't ever go out for dinner again? That's how selfish you are? How desperate you are NEVER to do anything nice for her?\n\n>She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? \n\nNo, she wants to break up because you literally told her that you would rather never go out again than pay for a single dinner out for her. Or even half of one.\n\n>This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. \n\nThat didn't happen over night, dude. It's been going on the entire time that she's been paying for all of your dates. It's just really being driven home now that you're fully ARGUING with her for your God-given right to never pay for a date.\n\n>But we go out for dates every week?\n\nNo. She buys you expensive restaurant dinners every week. Which you've let her know you would rather never eat again than ever treat her to.\n\nYou told her exactly what she's worth to you, to her face, and it is $0. Or, put another way, not even the cost of half a restaurant dinner. \n\nYTA. My only surprise is that it took her this long to figure out.

She certainly deserves it.", "Yta it wasn\u2019t overnight, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been everything she says and you just didn\u2019t care. \n\nIf your partner is saying she can\u2019t afford the dinner you both enjoyed you should have paid half and then had a discussion about going out and making the food budget more 50/50.

Single.time. Not you. Not even 50/50. \n\nYou got so comfy on her footing the bill 100% of the time. You never once by your own admission help her out. You have saved so much money over the 4 yrs not paying your way or treating her for a nice time. You sound 100% exactly like those girls no one likes who expect to get treated all the time and never pitch in. \n\nYTA. How come YOUR savings is important, but you don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t save and is bleeding money to cover you? She needs to save also. You are incredibly selfish. \n\nAnd she\u2019s been holding back for 4 years all the things that are unfair. So yes she\u2019s now telling you all the unfair things you\u2019ve done. Deal with it and suck it up and do better. AH", "Yta........ obligatory needs to be said: wtf you never thought to step up?\n\n\n\nBeyond your complete idiocy and total okay-ness with mooching off her, you need to apologize, tell her you're sorry for always letting her pay. And then surprise her with the spa day of her dreams. Mani pedi facial massage mudbath and meditation bowls. Whatever she digs she gets.\n\n\nThat being said, I UNDERSTAND your logic of \"she invited you out, she offered to pay, so she pays\". But it's totally tone deaf. The first handful of dates sure, why not. But after that you start understanding that you're in this together and you start pulling your own weight. Let her pay,   why not, of she offers and it makes her feel good, but then you pay for her groceries or whatever else to show your input. And DONT EVER forget that you aren't good enough for her if you don't step the fuck up.", "YTA. She doesn't want to break up \"over a $90 check.\"\n\nSounds like you're saving for your future and she's doing most of the saving \"because she budget so well\" and puts away more money. Nothing stopping you from doing the same. \n\nShe plans/pays for all dates and you don't do anything. Instead, you say we won't go out anymore because she asked for HALF the bill just once. You should be paying to take her out too. Even if the food is her responsibility, you can take her out on dates and stop being a cheap ass. \n\nShe cleaned the whole kitchen and you didn't help. She didn't want to cook and mess up the kitchen after all that. Do you typically not help around the house?\n\nFrom what you said, it appears she is financially more responsible, does the house work, pays for outings, and \"takes care of you so well\" yet you seem to do nothing for her. You ARE taking advantage of her and she wants to break up. My assumption is she's been done with your lack of effort for some time. Apologize and start pulling your own weight or you won't need to worry about it anymore because she'll be gone.", "Oh boy lol, YTA.\n\nDo you like, see the words you've typed out? Your girlfriend DOES have to plan and pay for every date, and your \"suggestion\" wasn't to split the burden but  instead to not go out at all - which is what she was complaining about! \n\nAlso, if she didn't want to clean anymore for the day and you didn't want to spend money, you could have offered to take care of the dishes...\n\nConsider including date nights in your budget. Otherwise, you might not have a girlfriend for much longer.", "This is hilarious. Your girlfriend is a class act and you're a mooch. Date nights were cool when it was on her dime, but now that you have to treat her, your solution is \"lol never again right?\"\n\nYTA.  So much.

Agree to a budget and frequently for dates and either split the bill or trade off paying. And no, NEVER going out to dinner is not an acceptable option if you want to stay in this relationship. You\u2019re GF has spent this long treating you and deserves to be treated once and a while.

I am totally speculating here but I'm not sure your girlfriend would agree you have open communication. First of all, you're probably going to need to wait until SHE is ready to talk. Second, and this is hard, when she's ready (if she ever is) you need to listen and not immediately become defensive. There may be other things you need to hear from her.

If my husband would spend his last $50 on a video game even tho we haven\u2019t had a date in a month, that would hurt. In a partnership you need to have some responsibility to the happiness of both partners. She\u2019s doing it already, you need to find a way to contribute.

You couldn't even reciprocate the thoughtfulness your gf was showing you, she was leading by example and you just kept taking and giving nothing back.", "Wah Wah Wah. That comment is very much like one my narcissistic birth giver would make. Is it always black/white for you? You don\u2019t see ANY options between the way you\u2019ve taken entitled advantage of your wonderful sounding partner and dumping her?\n\nYou sound extremely selfish and want a gold star for \u201chelping\u201d around your own home when she asks. Do you do anything in the relationship without her having to ask. She deserves so much better.", "Well since apparently putting actual effort or making her feel cared about is such a hard thing to grasp yeah you should.\n\nGiving her compliments isn\u2019t showing some they are valued.

Care about what SHE wants at least once in your relationship.\n\nFine, then we won't eat out ever again\nFine then I guess I'm awful ans I don't deserve you.  \n\nFine I guess I'll let you go on without me because I'm not even going to TRY to be better. \n\nGrow the fuck up.

You are well on your way to that.", "Orrrr you clean up your act and be a better boyfriend. Break up with her and she's gonna feel all it took was splitting the bills for one date night.

Now deal with your weaponized incompetence.", "You have been together four years and you don\u2019t know your own girlfriend. Yeah, that solidifies that you don\u2019t really care all that much about her enough to learn about her. While she put in everything to learn about you in order to love you the way you want to be loved. \n\nThat IS heartbreaking, for her and she deserves better.", "You don't even know what she likes? After 4 years? Damn you just failing all the relationship markers. Info how far is your head up your own backside? I'd say get it out there but you'd probably expect her to that for you too", "It breaks your heart? How do you think her heart feels?", "Hey op.. when\u2019s your anniversary?", "Therapy asap. This is so terrible, to not know a SINGLE thing she\u2019d like to do after four years?? This relationship sounds so sad for your gf. I can name things my coworkers like after only two weeks in a new job. And you haven\u2019t even taken the slightest time or effort to get to know her likes and dislikes at all, you clearly don\u2019t care about HER you care about what she does for you.

Y'all have been together for 4 YEARS and you don't know any restaurants or foods she likes or dislikes?!?! DUUUDDE! If you actually cared about her at all you wouldn't even be saying this. Send her the link to this post and let her leave you in the dust for someone that cares enough about her to be able to figure out something that she likes over the span of 4 years.\n\nThis has to be fake, you can't really be so self-centered that you don't know anything about the person you've been dating for 4 years.", "Why didn\u2019t you ever ask her questions about her life? Just basking in the attention of a woman who takes care of you is not a great relationship. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s going to break up with you, but you should print out all these comments in book form to check back on if you ever want to have a loving relationship. \nYTA", "\u2026.you don\u2019t know any of your girlfriend\u2019s favorite things after this long? This is too little too late. She should dump you because she is way too good for you.", "Talk things out, apologize admit you were being a shit partner. Start making a list of things she enjoys, ask her what she would like to do. Does she have a favorite jewelry stores.
