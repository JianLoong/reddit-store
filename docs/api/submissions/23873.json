I pay for utilities, she buys groceries, we both split rent and pay for our personal bills on our own. We have a joint account where we save for a future home. Finances has never been a huge issue. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are not flat broke, but we are in a place where saving money is a priority. She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do. \n\nMy girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week. She takes me to places I like, or a place we both equally enjoy. She always offers to pay, I always let her. She\u2019s not like normal girls who does the check dance but still expects the man to pay. Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. I like when she takes me on dates, it makes me feel good about saving money. I have good food, she spends the whole evening asking about me, complimenting me, and planning our future. She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me. \n\nThe problem came up last night when she had a huge craving for appetizers and margaritas. She complained about spending her day off cleaning the entire kitchen and she didn\u2019t want to dirty any other dishes. She suggested we go out, and I didn\u2019t see a problem with it. We had a great meal. Between the two of us we had a few margaritas and the bill was adding up. Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget. \n\nThis is where I got confused. She invited me out to dinner, made the suggestion, and is insisting we split the check? I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays. Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me? \n\nWe had a small argument, she got really upset, paid the check, and we walked home without speaking. I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore, this suggestion or any other suggestions wasn\u2019t helpful. \n\nShe\u2019s been distant and incredibly upset and is now mentioning the weirdest problems and making me feel like a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. But we go out for dates every week? \n\nPlease let me know AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for wanting to split the check?\n\nEDIT: \nThis post hit me like a ton of bricks. I\u2019ve never felt so terrible about how I\u2019ve treated my partner. I was so hung up on the principle of her always paying for my meals, and suddenly changing the dynamic. \n\nI was so hung up on the idea of wanting to save money and being impressed albeit jealous of the fact she always had so much money saved. \n\nI have reached out to her with an apology, and have insisted that we have an at home date with a bottle of wine, our two laptops, and a budgeting spreadsheet so we can both be on the same page. \n\nI really admire how equitable she\u2019s been in the relationship, and have never had anyone treat me the way she does in a relationship. It felt so good to be taken care of, but as many of you painfully pointed out, IATA, and she deserves some reciprocity.", "created_utc": 1691163027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15i361l/aita_for_getting_upset_when_my_28m_girlfriend_25f/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I pay for utilities, she buys groceries, we both split rent and pay for our personal bills on our own. We have a joint account where we save for a future home. Finances has never been a huge issue. \n\nMy girlfriend and I are not flat broke, but we are in a place where saving money is a priority. She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do. \n\nMy girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week. She takes me to places I like, or a place we both equally enjoy. She always offers to pay, I always let her. She\u2019s not like normal girls who does the check dance but still expects the man to pay. Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. I like when she takes me on dates, it makes me feel good about saving money. I have good food, she spends the whole evening asking about me, complimenting me, and planning our future. She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me. \n\nThe problem came up last night when she had a huge craving for appetizers and margaritas. She complained about spending her day off cleaning the entire kitchen and she didn\u2019t want to dirty any other dishes. She suggested we go out, and I didn\u2019t see a problem with it. We had a great meal. Between the two of us we had a few margaritas and the bill was adding up. Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget. \n\nThis is where I got confused. She invited me out to dinner, made the suggestion, and is insisting we split the check? I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays. Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me? \n\nWe had a small argument, she got really upset, paid the check, and we walked home without speaking. I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore, this suggestion or any other suggestions wasn\u2019t helpful. \n\nShe\u2019s been distant and incredibly upset and is now mentioning the weirdest problems and making me feel like a bad boyfriend. She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. But we go out for dates every week? \n\nPlease let me know AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for wanting to split the check?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How entitled are you?", "WOW. Of course YTA.\n\nYou may be the biggest AH I've ever seen on here, if you're not a troll, because there's literally no way you think that we're actually buying this bullshit:\n\n>She budgets beautifully, and is wonderful with saving money, therefore is fair to say she has more money then I do.\n\nSo, you do realise that this is just another way of saying, \"I can't be arsed to budget and I spend irresponsibly, so it's fair to say that I never have as much money left as she does because of my refusal to take responsibility for myself. A theme that apparently carries throughout . . .\n\n>My girlfriend makes it a point to make us go out to dinner once a week or every other week.  She always offers to pay, I always let her. \n\nWhy? Why do you always let her. Why do you not ever offer to pay? Do you not like her? Do you not think she deserves to be treated sometimes?\n\n>Whenever the bill comes the waiter hands me the check and without missing a beat she always asks, \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship. \n\nI'll bet you do. I can't think of anyone who WOULDN'T think it was a nice perk to go out to dinner weekly at restaurants and never ever pay. But again, you haven't explained WHY you always let her pay and never offer to treat her. Ever.\n\n>Before the bill came she asked if I would mind if we split the check, and began to explain how much these nights out are really eating away at her food budget.\r  \n\n\nReasonable. She's paying every single time and you're letting her. She lets you know that she cannot afford this, asks for the nights out that you admit you enjoy to be made more equitable. And . . . THIS is how you respond . . .\n\n>I would have denied the offer if I knew I would have to pay. \n\nAgain, why? Do you not love her? Do you not think she deserves for you to do nice things for her the way she does for you?\n\n>She also jabbed at me for always letting her pay, and never once offering. She feels she\u2019s being taken advantage of \n\nBecause you are literally taking advantage of her. You just admitted that if she didn't pay EVERY SINGLE TIME that you wouldn't take her out at all.\n\n>and if it wasn\u2019t for her, we would never go on dates because she\u2019s the one who makes plans and pays.\n\nYou just said yourself that this is true. That if you had to pay, you just wouldn't go out with her.\n\n> Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me?\n\nI mean, but that's a flat-out lie. No one is asking you to pay for \"every single date\". She's asking you to pay for ANY dates, EVER. You are literally having a tantrum because she asked you to pay for HALF OF ONE DATE, not even a whole date, after she has paid for \"every single date\" for several years. What are you on about? And how is \"saving money . . . important to \\[you\\]\"? You just wrote above that she's the one who is good at budgeting and saving, and implied that you are shitty at saving and never have any money. So which is it? You're either lying about saving being important to you, or you were lying earlier that you're not good at saving. Either way you're lying to us.\n\n> I said we just won\u2019t go out to dinner anymore\n\nSo it's okay for her to pay for all of your dates, all of the time . . .but if she asks you to pay for half of a date, much less pay for an occasional entire meal, you throw your toys out the pram and decide you just won't ever go out for dinner again? That's how selfish you are? How desperate you are NEVER to do anything nice for her?\n\n>She\u2019s even mentioned wanting to break up, over a $90 check? \n\nNo, she wants to break up because you literally told her that you would rather never go out again than pay for a single dinner out for her. Or even half of one.\n\n>This is news to me, but overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. \n\nThat didn't happen over night, dude. It's been going on the entire time that she's been paying for all of your dates. It's just really being driven home now that you're fully ARGUING with her for your God-given right to never pay for a date.\n\n>But we go out for dates every week?\n\nNo. She buys you expensive restaurant dinners every week. Which you've let her know you would rather never eat again than ever treat her to.\n\nYou told her exactly what she's worth to you, to her face, and it is $0. Or, put another way, not even the cost of half a restaurant dinner. \n\nYTA. My only surprise is that it took her this long to figure out.

She certainly deserves it.", "Yta it wasn\u2019t overnight, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been everything she says and you just didn\u2019t care. \n\nIf your partner is saying she can\u2019t afford the dinner you both enjoyed you should have paid half and then had a discussion about going out and making the food budget more 50/50.

Single.time. Not you. Not even 50/50. \n\nYou got so comfy on her footing the bill 100% of the time. You never once by your own admission help her out. You have saved so much money over the 4 yrs not paying your way or treating her for a nice time. You sound 100% exactly like those girls no one likes who expect to get treated all the time and never pitch in. \n\nYTA. How come YOUR savings is important, but you don\u2019t care if she can\u2019t save and is bleeding money to cover you? She needs to save also. You are incredibly selfish. \n\nAnd she\u2019s been holding back for 4 years all the things that are unfair. So yes she\u2019s now telling you all the unfair things you\u2019ve done. Deal with it and suck it up and do better. AH", "Yta........ obligatory needs to be said: wtf you never thought to step up?\n\n\n\nBeyond your complete idiocy and total okay-ness with mooching off her, you need to apologize, tell her you're sorry for always letting her pay. And then surprise her with the spa day of her dreams. Mani pedi facial massage mudbath and meditation bowls. Whatever she digs she gets.\n\n\nThat being said, I UNDERSTAND your logic of \"she invited you out, she offered to pay, so she pays\". But it's totally tone deaf. The first handful of dates sure, why not. But after that you start understanding that you're in this together and you start pulling your own weight. Let her pay,   why not, of she offers and it makes her feel good, but then you pay for her groceries or whatever else to show your input. And DONT EVER forget that you aren't good enough for her if you don't step the fuck up.", "YTA. She doesn't want to break up \"over a $90 check.\"\n\nSounds like you're saving for your future and she's doing most of the saving \"because she budget so well\" and puts away more money. Nothing stopping you from doing the same. \n\nShe plans/pays for all dates and you don't do anything. Instead, you say we won't go out anymore because she asked for HALF the bill just once. You should be paying to take her out too. Even if the food is her responsibility, you can take her out on dates and stop being a cheap ass. \n\nShe cleaned the whole kitchen and you didn't help. She didn't want to cook and mess up the kitchen after all that. Do you typically not help around the house?\n\nFrom what you said, it appears she is financially more responsible, does the house work, pays for outings, and \"takes care of you so well\" yet you seem to do nothing for her. You ARE taking advantage of her and she wants to break up. My assumption is she's been done with your lack of effort for some time. Apologize and start pulling your own weight or you won't need to worry about it anymore because she'll be gone.", "Oh boy lol, YTA.\n\nDo you like, see the words you've typed out? Your girlfriend DOES have to plan and pay for every date, and your \"suggestion\" wasn't to split the burden but  instead to not go out at all - which is what she was complaining about! \n\nAlso, if she didn't want to clean anymore for the day and you didn't want to spend money, you could have offered to take care of the dishes...\n\nConsider including date nights in your budget. Otherwise, you might not have a girlfriend for much longer.", "This is hilarious. Your girlfriend is a class act and you're a mooch.

YTA OP, and you need to start appreciating your girlfriend because if you don't, someone else will.", "YTA it wasn\u2019t over night she just finally got sick of you. The fact you\u2019ve never offered to pay for dinner ever is fucking insane like I get she wants to go out, but it sounds like if she didn\u2019t suggest it you\u2019d never go on dates ever and she has to plan everything. It also sounds likely that she has to cook and clean everything so I can\u2019t blame her for wanting a night off from it", "YTA\n\nWhy do men do this. You\u2019ve admitted to her planning and paying for literally every date, but when she asked to split one you\u2019ve asked us \u201cis it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date?\u201d. You literally pay for none, not one, nowhere near every one - so stop twisting it!! You\u2019re an entitled prick who\u2019s spit his dummy out because his girlfriend got tired of putting in all the emotional and financial labour to keep your date nights alive and thus your relationship. \n\nYou say you like it because it makes you feel good, taken care of, special, she spends all evening asking about you - do you not think she wants any of this in return?! The people on this sub make me want to tear my hair out sometimes. Get a clue.", "YTA\nMASSIVE ASSHOLE\nHow can you read over your post and not think you're in the wrong here?", "YTA\n\nAnd frankly, your edit feels insincere. I think you don\u2019t like being called out, you\u2019ll try for a while but that you\u2019re going to go back to wanting her to pamper and think about you first, before herself even.", "YTA, a shameless free loader who is unwilling to reciprocate the attention and care your partner provides you graciously. Instead of being open to splitting the costs of these experiences you could continue to share, you shut down and affirm to her you\u2019re unwilling to make an effort for her or your relationship. Lame, pathetic, I hope she DOES leave you because you\u2019re so selfish, dense and misconstrued", "Yta. She didn\u2019t even ask you to pay, she asked you to split it- why do you think you\u2019re entitled to be treated every single time? \nShe spent her day off cleaning and just wanted to get dinner, she wasn\u2019t taking you on a damn date.", "You truly lack self awareness, what do you do to make her feel special or wanted besides penis? I would dump you, you should never stop dating your partner.", "YTA what you should have done was offer\u2026PAY the bill YOURSELF!!!! You have been treated to meals out almost weekly!! About bloody time you chipped in!!!!!", "YTA, what exactly do you bring to the relationship?", "You should break up with her and let her find a man that appreciates what an awesome woman she is.   You don\u2019t deserve her.", "is this one of those posts where genders are reversed to prove a point?", "I'm glad to see you realise YTA before it's too late.", "Is she your girlfriend or business partner?? You ARE taking advantage of her and I bet you wouldn't even notice if she stopped \"asking you on dates\" until you got a craving for something! You are totally the asshole.", "What as ass. You would definitely be my ex", "You seem kind of cheap, here are my reasons: girlfriend of 4 years, always pays when you go out, serious, long term girlfriend, asks you for help splitting the bill after having a nice dinner with you, because she feels she isn\u2019t able to keep within her means if she keeps paying for these dinners, you say no, and if you knew that you\u2019d have to pay your fair share then you never would have gone out. Seriously? You would\u2019ve refused to have a nice dinner with your woman of four years, if the notion had occurred to you that you would have to pay for your part of the meal. And later it turns out it\u2019s only 45 bucks. Boggles my mind that you could possible think she\u2019s the bad guy here", "god do you even hear yourself? YTA\n\n- your girlfriend makes sure to take you on dates she plans and pays for WEEKLY\n- she talks to you, asks about you, shows you appreciation and love, makes you feel special\n- she always offers to pay and you never bat an eye\n\nand this time, she spent her day off cleaning the house you share (did you even help with anything?)\n\nso she wanted something special. and you were both spending more than usual than you might when eating. she asks if you can split the bill because these nice things she does for you really eats into her savings. and she spent all day cleaning. so shes asking nicely just for a bit of help, a bit of kindness, a bit of love, to cover half of this bill she\u2019s never expected you to pay.\n\nby your own admission you like these dates and could afford to contribute to them.\n\nbut no, the mere notion upsets you so much you decide no more dinner dates.\n\nwhen was the last time you took her somewhere? when was the last time you spent money on her? when was the last time you tried to make her feel as special as she makes you feel?? and it only counts if you did it without her having to ask for it.\n\n4 years and half of one bill is all it took for you to ruin your relationship.\n\nshes probably bern waiting 4 years for you to show her she means something to you and now shes got the message, that you dont care about her and cant be bothered to show it.\n\nyoure entitled and selfish and neglectful. i hope she leaves you. cuz this didnt happen over night buddy, its clearly been a long time coming.", "I have good food, she spends the whole evening asking about me, complimenting me, and planning our future. She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me. \n\nHey dude, ever hear that expression, \"treat others as you want to be treated\"?\nShe's showing you how she wants to be treated and you're not listening.", "<this is my first time replying to a post, sorry if i make any mistakes>\n\ni have read so many posts on here\u2026 but yours is so upsetting. \n\nthe first part was going well or so i thought but after reading completely i understood you were praising her ability to save YOUR money by spending hers. \n\nanyways YTA.", "And just to note, your solution to her having an issue with her always paying the bill wasn't going 50/50, it was to never go out to eat again. \n\nThis!  \"Never going out to eat again\" is the reasoning of an 8 yr old.\nHope she takes you up on your solution. She would definitely benefit from not dining with a freeloading deadbeat.", "He spends half of this gushing about how great it makes him feel for her to treat him like this, and it never once occurred to him to make her feel good?  Take her someplace she liked, focus on her, talk about her?  How selfish do you have to be to not even think of that?", "YTA - for exactly the above reason and I would like to add:\n\n>Is it really so awful that I don\u2019t want to pay for every single date, and saving money is important to me?\n\nAsshole you aren't paying for any of them! You are literally letting her take you out and NEVER pay or seem to even be asking or focusing on her. All of the attention is on you and how you feel, and that's all you care about.\n\n>overnight I became an unappreciative and ignorant boyfriend who never helps out, or makes her feel special. But we go out for dates every week?\n\nYou go on dates every week that she is paying for and that you are getting the attention. I mean, damn, she's paying and you can't even ask about her and compliment her so that she feels special. Do you even thank her for taking you out?\n\n>She complained about spending her day off cleaning the entire kitchen and she didn\u2019t want to dirty any other dishes\n\nShe spent her day off cleaning the kitchen (and let's be honest probably the whole place to but voiced this part which you call complaining) that you guys share (I'm sure she is the one that does the cooking right?) , and voiced that she didn't want to dirty dishes. And your thought instead of being \"thanks for cleaning on your day off,  let me take you out\", was oh good let's go out so that after you've cleaned all day you can also pay for my meal?\n\nI hope she does leave you. Clearly, you don't appreciate her. JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE AND A USELESS BOYFRIEND.\n\nETA: And she asked you to split 1 date night check (not even fully pay for the date just your part of it) and your reaction was fine we won't go out to eat anymore. Good luck finding a new girlfriend that puts up with your assholery.", "She\u2019s never expressed a lot of dissatisfaction in the relationship before that night. She would sometimes ask me for help around the house and I always obliged. I thank her for doing the dishes and folding laundry. I tell her she\u2019s beautiful when we go on dates. I thought this was all enough, but I can see now I haven\u2019t been pulling my weight.", "I'd put money on him sliding her the bill after the server leaves or says something to the effect of \"Oh she'll take care of it.\"", "Yup, this is the verdict right here.\n\nThis isn't a typical other person orders a bunch of crap and suddenly wants to split the bill.  OP's been getting free din-din for a while.  He can pony up for a dinner now and then.", "Lol, exactly. What an AH.", "My jaw was dropped the entire time reading OPs post and this so clearly picked it apart.. he wrote this post with both hands and posted it thinking he was the victim in this situation.", "Yea it\u2019s crazy they OP is basically admitting his partner does all of the work in regards to their dates and doesn\u2019t see how big of an asshole that alone makes him.", "Plus the fact that it sounds like OP isn\u2019t contributing to the house work either since she spent her entire day off cleaning the house, seemingly without any participation on OPs part. \n\nSo she\u2019s responsible for the lions share of the saving, and paying for all the dates, and maintaining their home, all while also working full time. Sounds like OP isn\u2019t pulling his weight across the board in this relationship.", "I thought the same thing!! I get wanting your girlfriend to do the check dance, because offering to pay would make you feel like you\u2019re treating your partner and she would show her appreciation? It seems like she\u2019s doing everything for a man who doesn\u2019t want to make her feel special", "At the beginning of the relationship I took her on so many dates, and then confided in her that I\u2019m down on cash and she started insisting on paying. One time I tried to fight her on it, but she was reassuring that she wanted to cover things. I guess I loved that feeling and depended on it. It became our dynamic. Since posting I understand how terrible this was to expect such behavior from a partner.", "And that little dig at \"other girls who do the check dance but expect the guy to pay every time\" when he won't pretend to do the dance in the first place. Fucking delusional.  YTA OP", "I\u2019ve dated people like OP. Really not that unbelievable.", "Pretty sure this is one of those gender swapped posts.\n\nFeels too on the nose.", "My favourite comment of the day!", "YTA.\n\n\u201d \u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d I always agree, I think this is such a nice perk in the relationship.

She\u2019s very sweet and does so much for me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in this paragraph.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to pay?\u201d Is very different from affirmatively saying \u201cit\u2019s on me\u201d.\n\nIt sounds like this is a conversation that she\u2019s been wanting to have.\n\nYou list how wonderful she is for you.  She spent her day off cleaning and is tired.  It would be nice for her to be taken out for the evening.\n\nShe should have brought it up sooner and in a better more direct  way.  But it sounds like this is about more than $90.\n\nShe\u2019s not feeling an even partnership (my interpretation from limited facts) and likely taken for granted.\n\nWatch The Break Up.  Keep in mind it\u2019s never really about the lemons.", "What else can I do?", "I'm starting to think the same... hoping anyway.  Nobody could be THIS lame!", "It reminds me of when one partner tells the other one \u201cHey, what you just said hurt my feelings\u201d and they respond \u201cSince I can\u2019t say anything right I guess I\u2019ll just NEVER TALK AGAIN\u201d", "And I bet she cooks all the meals at home, too.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to enjoy how well your partner makes you feel, and be upset when there\u2019s a shift in dynamic.", "Why can\u2019t you do chores without being asked?

Insane behavior.", "This woman is a gem and I hope you spend the rest of your time together making up for this shit because *it is bad*. I wouldn't blame her for dumping your ass no matter how much you beg.", "You stopped pursuing her and just sat back and let her pursue you, that\u2019s\u2026 Pretty sad. She gets absolutely no attention from you while you expect it from her, which is also very sad. She deserves more, she deserves someone who wants to plan dates as much as she does. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to plan a cute date at home by setting up blankets and snacks, yet you don\u2019t have the brainpower to do that? Do you really care so little about this girl?

OP is shitting of women like they're gross gold   \ndiggers while expecting his gf of 4 years to pay for everything.

This is definitely a conversation you guys need to have but not while you are trying to apologize. Set up an actual date, and pay for it!", "The budgeting spreadsheet is not a bad idea, but don't try to put it in place of a nice night out. Dude, she has given you many of these. You spelled out that you liked how it felt to be taken out and not worry about money, eating nice food, and having her pay attention to you.\n\nSO DO THAT FOR HER.\n\nSave the budgeting for later. I understand where you're coming from, but it's not the fun surprise you think it is. However, I do commend you for trying. Good luck.", "Change. Be better. Learn empathy. Recognize that a relationship is as much about making sure HER needs are met as, if not more, than making sure your needs are met. Learn that people are more important than money.

Because again, you haven\u2019t been reciprocating and you neglected her and her wants and needs over your own and you put her in a financial hole by not paying at least half.", "The only place where he describes here at all he says \"she budgets beautfully and saves wonderfully\" like that's the only thing that matters.", "And you let her clean the kitchen all by herself on her day off?", "I don\u2019t really see the need to do the dishes and clean the entire kitchen immediately after we use it, but if she asks for her I\u2019ll be there scrubbing away at the already cleaned counters", "So you do not help clean after cooking?"]}
