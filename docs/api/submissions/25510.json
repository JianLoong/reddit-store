Since the beginning of the relationship a serious pressure point with us has been gift giving. \n\nMy number one love language (giving and receiving) is gifts. It is not a materialistic thing. It is about the time the person puts into thinking of a tangible object that would be good for you be it practically or aesthetically, and then deciding to put in the effort to get the object and give it as a gift. My partner is TERRIBLE at gifts. \n\nOur first \u201cgift giving occasion\u201d together was Christmas. I bought him a beautiful watch. He got me\u2026 nothing. Valentine\u2019s Day. I got\u2026 nothing. He got a custom made whiskey glass set with stones. My birthday. I got a \u201cday of experiences\u201d that were all things *he* likes to do, and no gift. Finally after almost a year together I sat him down and explained calmly about why I was hurt that I wasn\u2019t receiving gifts on these occasions. I took the time to explain how and why gifts were important to me. That it wasn\u2019t about the money it was *literally* the thought that counts. Fast forward two years to my birthday and the gifts situation has not gotten better. If (big if) I get a gift for an occasion it is obviously not thoughtful and unwrapped. \n\nWe have a combined budget. With my birthday coming up we discussed putting $200 aside for my birthday present and dinner. With 9 days to my birthday I asked, out of concern, if he had any ideas yet on what he wanted to get me since he hadn\u2019t asked me what I wanted yet. He said that he knew so I dropped the conversation. I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential surprise. \n\nThen my birthday rolls around. I work that morning so does he. We get dressed to go out to dinner late in the evening. No gift all day. As we are driving I\u2019m sneaking peeks in the car hoping that maybe he has a gift stashed somewhere. We sit down at the table\u2026 maybe it\u2019s in his pocket? So finally I ask right before ordering \u201cwhat did you get me for my birthday?\u201d \n\nHe says nothing. My stomach sinks. Tears come to my eyes. I do my best to not cry at the table. I lose my appetite completely. The server comes around and I don\u2019t order. I blame it on an upset stomach. I ask him why, after almost three years and all of the gift conversations would he not buy me something. He says everything from \u201cnot having the money\u201d (untrue we budgeted for it). To \u201cno matter what I get you, you won\u2019t be happy\u201d. (Also untrue I pointed out multiple gifts over the years given by friends at many price points and how much I cherish them)\n\nUltimately I don\u2019t order. We cut the date short and we go home. On the way home he mentions that he can\u2019t believe I would ruin my birthday dinner over a gift. Not much has been said about it since on either side. So I\u2019m trying to see before I confront this situation one final time.

I checked back to the beginning of the post to make sure you didn't say he was your husband.  He's thoughtless. Maybe the first year I could see him being clueless. But after multiple conversations about how hurtful this is, he still doesn't think of you. Meanwhile, he happily accepts your gifts and then sits there like a jackass,empty-handed at your literal birthday dinner. He knows how you feel, and he deliberately ruins every gift giving occasion for you by CHOOSING not to put forth any effort. Is this how you want to spend your life? Disappointed and hurt at every birthday. Every Christmas. Every anniversary.  He's showing you who he really is. Believe him.", "NTA, but there is no point in further discussion.\n\nIt shouldn't take 3 years to figure out that this guy is a failure when it comes to giving gifts.

You have to stop giving him gifts and stop expecting gifts if and only if there are good reasons why you want to stay with him. My SO would have a whinge about every single gift I gave him. He never gave me gifts either. So I stopped giving him presents but stayed because the rest of the relationship was fine. \n\nI have found most people don\u2019t appreciate gifts no matter how much thought I give to them. Gift yourself and give whatever you can to others.\n\nOr you could be really petty: buy and wrap something yourself and make a big deal about opening it in front of him. Better still if you arrange to have it delivered and act like you don\u2019t know who sent it.", "NTA.  I'm like you.  I love giving gifts and put so much thought into finding the perfect gift and everyone always loves them.  Even if it's just funny socks that are perfect for them, it shows that you know and appreciate them.\n\nMy ex-wife was exactly like your husband.  I always got her thoughtful gifts or even vacations for her birthday.  Then when my birthday rolled around, she would wish me happy birthday once and that would be it.  No card.  No gift.

I guess that's why she's my ex-wife now....", "NTA.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are LDR right now. She buys and sends me things sometimes because she wants to and it's NEVER about the thing.

NTA.\n\nThis being Reddit, I\u2019m sure people are going to tell you to leave him over it\u2014as is infallibly the advice here about anything in a relationship which isn\u2019t great. \n\nTo me, if he\u2019s an otherwise good partner, I\u2019d think that is an overreaction. It seems foolish to throw away 362 good days a year because on Christmas, your birthday and Valentines Day he doesn\u2019t come through.

My ex made me cry on my birthday one year and that was the year he became an ex. You may be in a relationship where you claim to be happy, but if you two decide to have children, guess who won't be getting a Mother's Day gift. \n\nMen play these games all the time and he knows exactly what he's doing. You can put on blinders or rose-colored glasses all you want, but he also flipped the script on you on your birthday and has you questioning if you're the AH for being HURT and disappointed. Mind you, he knew you'd be expecting something because you asked prior to your day. He lied about why he didn't get you a gift and said you wouldn't have been happy anyway. Hence, his best bet was to not get you anything at all. \n\nStick it out with him if you want, then you'll find yourself stuck, miserable and not even looking forward to the gift giving events you love so much. Ultimately, he wants you to not expect anything from him, so that lets him off easy even though it means so much to you. Do you though, and best of luck.", "NTA. Break up with him", "NAH\n\nHere's my question: how is the relationship other than this? Is he a good partner? Does he make you happy? Do you see yourself with him long term?\n\nIf the relationship is good overall, and he's just a crap gift giver, I would gently tell you to move past the idea that the only way your BF can show you love is by being an amazing, creative gift giver. That's not who he is! Some people are not good gift givers. My family is great about creating wish lists and everyone just picks things off each other's wish lists to give as gifts for holidays and birthdays. That way we always get things we like! Have you tried making a wish list that he can choose items from to surprise you with for holidays and your birthday? Be part of the solution, rather than being teary and a martyr on every birthday.\n\nAlso, if you are in a relationship long term you will probably find that big huge celebrations and gift exchanges peter out over time. My husband and I used to do sentimental gifts and big to dos over every little minor anniversary when we were first together. Now after many years of marriage, he asks me what I want for my birthday or Christmas and I usually tell him not to get me anything or ask if he will just cook an easy meal I like for my birthday. \"Stuff\" matters a lot less as you get older. It's getting to spend time with the people in your life who matter to you, and experiences that count.", "ESH\n\nHe has been a shitty partner the entire time.  He is clearly an asshole because he does not listen.  \n\nHowever, what made you think that he would magically change this time? He has never put effort into gifts and you waited almost a year to tell him it bothered you? And then he didn't change and you waited 2 more years to break down? *GURRRRRRLLLLLL*- you are an asshole to yourself.  When someone doesn't meet your expectations, *AND* you just accept it, you are telling that person it's not that important.  Set expectations and be clear with yourself about what actions you'll take if the person does not meet those expectations repeatedly.", "I thought people who's love language is gifts like to give and it's not about them receiving.

If you decided to stay in the relationship - and there may be good reasons to do so - then you need to adjust your expectations.

Instead, take the money that you would have spent and get yourself something or an experience that you'd really like.

I think that is what you are trying to articulate here: He is very clearly ignoring your explicit cues about needs. \n\nIt isn't about you wanting material things. You want what those things would show you: thought, care, and love. \n\nThis is a pretty big red flag about his feelings.", "NTA.
