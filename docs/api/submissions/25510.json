Since the beginning of the relationship a serious pressure point with us has been gift giving. \n\nMy number one love language (giving and receiving) is gifts. It is not a materialistic thing. It is about the time the person puts into thinking of a tangible object that would be good for you be it practically or aesthetically, and then deciding to put in the effort to get the object and give it as a gift. My partner is TERRIBLE at gifts. \n\nOur first \u201cgift giving occasion\u201d together was Christmas. I bought him a beautiful watch. He got me\u2026 nothing. Valentine\u2019s Day. I got\u2026 nothing. He got a custom made whiskey glass set with stones. My birthday. I got a \u201cday of experiences\u201d that were all things *he* likes to do, and no gift. Finally after almost a year together I sat him down and explained calmly about why I was hurt that I wasn\u2019t receiving gifts on these occasions. I took the time to explain how and why gifts were important to me. That it wasn\u2019t about the money it was *literally* the thought that counts. Fast forward two years to my birthday and the gifts situation has not gotten better. If (big if) I get a gift for an occasion it is obviously not thoughtful and unwrapped. \n\nWe have a combined budget. With my birthday coming up we discussed putting $200 aside for my birthday present and dinner. With 9 days to my birthday I asked, out of concern, if he had any ideas yet on what he wanted to get me since he hadn\u2019t asked me what I wanted yet. He said that he knew so I dropped the conversation. I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential surprise. \n\nThen my birthday rolls around. I work that morning so does he. We get dressed to go out to dinner late in the evening. No gift all day. As we are driving I\u2019m sneaking peeks in the car hoping that maybe he has a gift stashed somewhere. We sit down at the table\u2026 maybe it\u2019s in his pocket? So finally I ask right before ordering \u201cwhat did you get me for my birthday?\u201d \n\nHe says nothing. My stomach sinks. Tears come to my eyes. I do my best to not cry at the table. I lose my appetite completely. The server comes around and I don\u2019t order. I blame it on an upset stomach. I ask him why, after almost three years and all of the gift conversations would he not buy me something. He says everything from \u201cnot having the money\u201d (untrue we budgeted for it). To \u201cno matter what I get you, you won\u2019t be happy\u201d. (Also untrue I pointed out multiple gifts over the years given by friends at many price points and how much I cherish them)\n\nUltimately I don\u2019t order. We cut the date short and we go home. On the way home he mentions that he can\u2019t believe I would ruin my birthday dinner over a gift. Not much has been said about it since on either side. So I\u2019m trying to see before I confront this situation one final time.

Meanwhile, he happily accepts your gifts and then sits there like a jackass,empty-handed at your literal birthday dinner. He knows how you feel, and he deliberately ruins every gift giving occasion for you by CHOOSING not to put forth any effort. Is this how you want to spend your life?

He never gave me gifts either.

Gift yourself and give whatever you can to others.\n\nOr you could be really petty: buy and wrap something yourself and make a big deal about opening it in front of him.

I always got her thoughtful gifts or even vacations for her birthday.  Then when my birthday rolled around, she would wish me happy birthday once and that would be it.  No card.  No gift.

It seems foolish to throw away 362 good days a year because on Christmas, your birthday and Valentines Day he doesn\u2019t come through.

You can put on blinders or rose-colored glasses all you want, but he also flipped the script on you on your birthday and has you questioning if you're the AH for being HURT and disappointed. Mind you, he knew you'd be expecting something because you asked prior to your day. He lied about why he didn't get you a gift and said you wouldn't have been happy anyway. Hence, his best bet was to not get you anything at all. \n\nStick it out with him if you want, then you'll find yourself stuck, miserable and not even looking forward to the gift giving events you love so much.

Break up with him", "NAH\n\nHere's my question: how is the relationship other than this? Is he a good partner? Does he make you happy? Do you see yourself with him long term?\n\nIf the relationship is good overall, and he's just a crap gift giver, I would gently tell you to move past the idea that the only way your BF can show you love is by being an amazing, creative gift giver. That's not who he is! Some people are not good gift givers. My family is great about creating wish lists and everyone just picks things off each other's wish lists to give as gifts for holidays and birthdays. That way we always get things we like! Have you tried making a wish list that he can choose items from to surprise you with for holidays and your birthday? Be part of the solution, rather than being teary and a martyr on every birthday.\n\nAlso, if you are in a relationship long term you will probably find that big huge celebrations and gift exchanges peter out over time. My husband and I used to do sentimental gifts and big to dos over every little minor anniversary when we were first together. Now after many years of marriage, he asks me what I want for my birthday or Christmas and I usually tell him not to get me anything or ask if he will just cook an easy meal I like for my birthday. \"Stuff\" matters a lot less as you get older.

He is clearly an asshole because he does not listen.  \n\nHowever, what made you think that he would magically change this time? He has never put effort into gifts and you waited almost a year to tell him it bothered you? And then he didn't change and you waited 2 more years to break down? *GURRRRRRLLLLLL*- you are an asshole to yourself.  When someone doesn't meet your expectations, *AND* you just accept it, you are telling that person it's not that important.  Set expectations and be clear with yourself about what actions you'll take if the person does not meet those expectations repeatedly.", "I thought people who's love language is gifts like to give and it's not about them receiving.

This man has watched you be disappointed over and over again at his lack of effort and still thought it was okay to do. \n\nIs that something you can continue with? \n\u201cGood enough\u201d is not enough. \n\nSomeone blatantly ignoring a need I\u2019ve asked to be met is a circus full of red flags for me", "I can't believe he ruined her birthday over a gift. (And putting that on her is blame shifting!)", "\ud83e\udd47", "This. I love writing letters, and sending my partner, close friends and family members little random gifts, even if it's something really small. Quite often it's something I've made. It's something I love doing. It's not about the materialism or the expectation from them of receiving something. It's about giving them something that reminds them they are thought of. If I'm giving it in person, it's about seeing their face light up, or watching them laugh. Sitting down and spending the time on writing the letter to them or making the gift with love is like a little ritual to me and it's as meaningful to me as seeing them in person. Giving gifts or being happy to have been given a gift is not always about materialism. \n\nI agree. It's not about the gifts. It's about the fact that this guy is happy to accept love and consideration from her, but offers none back.", "Her expectations are \u201cI\u2019d love a birthday gift. Any gift.

After 20 years of him not bothering, she made up her five-year plan to become independent without making things hard on their children.   A while after their 25th anniversary, he mentioned that they had a big milestone coming up and did she want to do something.\n\nHe doesn't understand why they are divorced.", "No\u2026 No, gift giving, in any meaningful relationship, is part of the fun. It is not selfish to want a birthday gift. My God. No no no.", "I'm guessing that you have tried a \"wish list\" approach? Providing clear ideas of exact things you want? I've dated men that need that much help (i.e., wanting to get a gift, but not totally attuned to what I want, so I had a running list of types of things I liked: gold or bronze jewelry instead of silver, particular colors, styles, scents, my sizes; as well as specific items I liked- this pair of earrings, an item like this that my friend has, etc. that I could keep adding to so for any occasion there's always options).\n\nHowever. Can't tell here if your partner is \"bad\" at choosing gifts or the whole idea of exchanging gifts is just not interesting to him, so he can't understand why it is important to you (no matter how much you try to communicate it). Or, there is some kind of trigger there for him In either case, this may be a topic to take to therapy to explore both of your feelings about it and what you are needing from each other in the relationship.

This is a failure of effort and that\u2019s what\u2019s the most hurtful, feeling like your partner doesn\u2019t care enough to put in the effort to do the things that are important to you.

What is his? Because his needs are probably being met so he can't see that there is an issue. So perhaps what you can do is simply ask him how he would feel if you decided not to meet his needs? Sometimes people are bad perspective and he needs to understand that if he can't love you as you ask, then you can't stay with him.
