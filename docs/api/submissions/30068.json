Me and my husband work long hours, and are temporarily staying with his mom and grandma. My MIL and I have a really good relationship, she voices her opinion with my child but respects my wishes. Her mother on the other hand, does not. We had a long discussion before my baby was born about expectations and boundaries regarding our unborn child, and if our wishes weren't met contact with our child would be limited. I thought everyone would understand. I was wrong. \n\nIt started when my husband's grandma commented on my nursery ideas being stupid. I thought a Monsters Inc themed nursery would be a cute gender neutral idea. She said that would \"turn my child into something they're not supposed to be\".\n\nThen came the baby shower. I had been taking a relaxing bath just a couple weeks before the shower and as I was drying off I could hear my husband's grandmother complaining loudly with my MIL making fun of my shower theme. How I'm \"acting like this was for me and not a baby\" and that the theme was stupid. I locked myself in the bathroom crying and texting my husband who berated them when he got home.\n\nEvery doctor appointment we've had with our daughters pediatrician has basically turned into an argument between my husband's grandmother and me, Because, of course she knows better because \"these doctors are full of crap, don't know what they're talking about, I doubt they even have kids, etc.\" I honestly get tired of arguing with her mother about this stuff but I feel like I have to because If I don't, she'll continue to think it's okay. \n\nThis last appointment for my daughter's 6 month wellness check, we discussed trying to find tricks to help baby sleep. Lately she'll only fall asleep if shes sitting in bed with me, and then scream if I put her in the crib. I'm really not a fan of co-sleeping so I stay awake with her, sometimes all night if she's fussy. And I know for a fact she also takes naps in bed with her great grandma when I'm at work. The pediatrician of course suggested no more co-sleeping. When we came home, we told grandma and great grandma that co-sleeping is no longer permitted for anyone,  and it was at this point great grandma threw a huge fit , saying we can't tell them how to parent when we're not home, how she has her routine with me and a different routine with them, and we will not dictate how they do their routines with her. She said if we had her in a daycare we couldnt tell them how to take care of our kid, so we should give them the same respect. \n\nI got mad. Really mad. I told my husband if that's how it's gonna be I'm just gonna have my mom start watching our baby when we're not home. I don't play these games. I do not feel comfortable leaving my daughter there knowing my wishes will be ignored by someone there. So, if i went through with finding someone else to watch my daughter, WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1698774110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kqpt4/wibta_if_i_stopped_letting_my_mil_watch_my_child/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds adorable.\n\n\nETA: keep in mind that this behavior will last literally forever. It will not stop when your kid gets older- if you want one thing and grandma wants another, she will absolutely try to sway your kid to her thinking. She will trash talk you to your own child.

Great grandma's feelings don't get to count here.  \n\nWhen my first grandchild was born (20 years ago) i learned that babies are no longer put to sleep on their tummies.  Also that crib bumpers are considered unsafe.  Also that blankets shouldn't be used in a crib.  All of that seemed completely wrong to me, because it was the opposite of what I was taught when I had my kids (bumper pads keep baby from bumping his head, babies sleep better on their tummies and it's safer for them, babies sleep better if you swaddle them in a blanket).
