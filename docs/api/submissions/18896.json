Also, as someone who has been in your bro\u2019s position, putting him in rehab before he really wants sobriety would be a waste of money, the rehab bed and your efforts. Facing some of the consequences of his actions will tend to make him more ready to get sober IME.", "This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but I would say NTA. Throughout my time in middle school, high school, and the start of college my sister was addicted to heroin, so I understand where you're coming from. She went in and out of rehab probably 6 or 7 times before it stuck. If he isn't making the decision to go and get clean then it just won't stick. I also understand the personal strain it puts on you, addiction affects so many people beyond just the addict. And you're right, you have to put yourself first in this situation because nobody else is going to do that for you. The addict will always be the main focus, and the siblings are always pushed aside but still expected to help. \n\nI do hope he makes that decision for himself and recovers. I also wish you the best of luck on your surgery!", "NTA, but also is it really true that you can \"afford\" it? Having the funds != being able to afford it, especially since you do have upcoming surgery.", "NTA in the slightest, I also have a sibling with drug problems. I wouldn't pay for their rehab, their anything besides maybe a meal here or there. I wouldn't let them stay in my house overnight even. I still love them but my life has no time for someone else's addiction.", "NTA. He actually has to put in some effort", "NTA - You have your own health issues you need to focus on and have no idea how that will affect your financial stability since you're not even sure how bad your condition is.  You certainly can't count on your parents to help you out if you're out of work for an extended time or have medical bills your insurance won't cover if they're already coming to you for money.\n\nEven if you were healthy and stable, this wouldn't be your responsibility.  I might go with N A H in that case because them asking you would at least make sense.  Never hurts to ask and all that.  But knowing your current situation and still trying to get money from you firmly makes them the A H.\n\nI'm sure they can find a cheaper rehab, maybe one with a sliding scale since your brother is a full blown adult in poverty, so your parents income wouldn't matter if he was checking himself into a facility that allowed sliding scale or financial aid.  But in the end, if your brother isn't the one asking to go to rehab, it's not going to work anyway.", "NTA. Nobody can save him, he has to save himself.", "NTA. Not your responsibility, so many addicts just go in and out of rehab so much money wasted.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is in a shit situation and you could help him out, but it certainly isn\u2019t your obligation and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel guilty for not wanting to pay to fix your brother\u2019s issues. It\u2019s an unreasonable expectation that your parents are putting on you.", "NTA", "NTA - is he the golden child? It sounds like it. Like you said, you have enough to deal with.", "NTA-absolutely not. Your parents are AHs for even asking for money from their kid on behalf of their other kid!! Your brother is an adult. If he wants to borrow money from you, he should be doing the asking himself. He\u2019s not 10yo.", "NTA why is he too good for public rehab?\n\nIt is not a choice between no rehab and pay for the private rehab. \n\nHe can go to public rehab for free. Which is coincidentally within his budget. Doesn\u00b4t that work out nicely?", "NTA.  But your parents are. I have read some of your comments. The closer private upscale rehab is not any better than the further away free rehab. Your parents are most likely his enablers, and if he doesn\u2019t want the help, even overdosing doesn\u2019t mean rock bottom, no rehab is going to work no matter where it is located, and how pretty it is. I wouldn\u2019t waste your money. I have been there with my brother so I am speaking from experience. A lot of money was wasted on upscale rehabs, free rehabs, outpatient rehab, and nothing stuck. Most times my brother was persuaded to go for legal reasons. My brother overdosed and passed away five years ago. I love him and I hope he is now at peace, but darn he put our family through hell. Don\u2019t let your brother do that to you Op. Good luck with you surgery and take care!", "WNBTA   NTA - *He needs to want rehab. Only he can walk this path*. Check out free Al-Anon to understand this.  Not once did you mention his view on this new rehab opportunity. You can pour a $1M into rehab but it will be wasted because he needs to do the work. Once you pay the rehab bill in full you will not be reimbursed...by the agency, your parents, your brother. Like you money was lite on fire.\n\nYou're under pressure, I get it. Your parents sound desperate and are willing to risk your health by funding his rehab....this is atrocious. They aren't emotionally grounded right now. YOU matter. Attend counseling so you are supported through your priorities and address your conflicted feelings (this is normal) about your brother. This will give you strength, skills and insight should he not be revived this year. He has to reach his personal lowest human function and want help. There are tons of free local programs and housing he qualifies for (in the US) that Medicaid pays for. Has he taken steps to secure basic human needs: housing, food, recovery, AA meetings (a sponsor)?  Best to you.", "NTA\n\nNot your responsibility, especially if he is unwilling to recognize his own addiction issues.\n\nSucks, but they need to look into affordable treatment and/or contact local sources for help.", "If he has no job and is basically homeless, social services/medical assistance may be able to send him somewhere.\n\nYou need to deal with you, and it is horrid that your parents are harassing their child that is about to go in for heart surgery.\n\nNTA", "Your country is the AH, for making you pay for rehab in the first place.   \n\n\nIf you could afford it but just don't care, you're kind of an AH sister. Though I don't know how close of a family you are. I just know I would give my arm if it would save my brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Quite frankly, I think the pharmaceutical companies should pay.", "INFO does your brother want to go to rehab, or is it your parents that have convinced him to go?", "YWNBTA  he has somewhere free to go, but even if he didn't, it's not your responsibility to pay for his rehab.", "NTA. And best wishes for your surgery and fast recovery! Your heart definitely doesn't need the additional stress...", "NAH\n\nTbh, if it were my brother I'd bend heaven and earth to help him, however, I also know that you can't force someone in addition to get help if they aren't ready or wiling. If he isn't ready it will just be wasting everyone's money", "NAH\n\nI think your parents are FREAKING the eff out right now. They've got one kid with a defective heart and major surgery coming up, and another who's an addict who just overdosed and nearly died. Basically, they have two kids with absolutely massive problems they can't solve, both facing death.\n\nI think I'm their panic they have latched onto rehab as the miracle fix. If they can just somehow, magically, get him into rehab, everything will be better. It's something they can control, with actionable items they can tackle and check off. Having you help pay would be checking off the \"fix sibling relationship!\" and \"prove we were good parents because OP wound up a generous person and our kids like each other!\" boxes. \n\nBut you have too many things to deal with in your own. You cannot be their emotional support human right now. They need to find someone else to hash this out with, and you need to find someone else for your own issues as well.", "Nta. This is not your responsibility. You arent the one who became a drug addict.", "This.    Your parents need to stop parenting him.  That sucks.  Ask me how I know.   \n\nHowever a bit of concern for your health wouldn\u2019t hurt, now would it?  I am sorry their focus is likely painful much less the guilt the are trying to give you.

It\u2019s just not the one the parents want.", "Can I was you mean by my insurance not covering? I don't understand what that means.\n\nTechnically my brother could go to rehab for free but the only spaces with spots right now are not close to here and my parents prefer the private and more upscale rehab (though I don't know exactly what the difference between them is)", "Just to clarify, my brother could get free rehab through the province but the only places with beds currently open are a little further away than my parents would like. Between that and the private place being more upscale, my parents have a preference for that one.", "It doesn't sound like you've ever been through this in real life.  If you want to chip in for OP'S brother's rehab, send her your contact info.", "Venmo OP some funds if your committed to this perspective.", "He does not want to go but he's going because it's either there or a homeless shelter. (My parents live in a retirement community and can't take him in so has nowhere to go)", "That just makes it even clearer that OP doesn't need to give them money.  There is a free option available.  Getting treatment should be the priority, not trying to get him into a more upscale place.", "\"Prefers the upscale\"...what a bougie perspective. They can want a lot but there is no funding to support this. Your $$ is for your health. Absolutely choose the free option because statistics indicate he will be sustained until released because he does not want rehab on a deep personal level. \\*Location should not matter. If they are trying to save his life, let him rebuild anywhere.", "Might be a location issue.  I'm in the USA and here there is always a risk of the medical insurance deciding they won't cover part (or even all) of a procedure/medication/hospital stay, etc.\n\nIf your parents want to waste their money, that's their choice.  They have no right to pressure you.  Especially as their is a free rehab option for your brother.", "They don't want you to pay for his rehab, they want you to pay for their own personal preferences.\n\nYou not paying doesn't keep him from getting rehab. They can pay for their own personal choices.", "\"Further away than my parents would like.\" :D What even... They can't afford something, and there's a free option, but since they don't like the distance, you have to pay? NTA.", "Then definitely NTA, although you should also clarify that you have no financial obligation for your surgery.\n\nIncidentally, the rehab won\u2019t work unless brother wants it.", "NTA Doesn't this count as choosy beggars?", "NTA \n\nIf your parents are choosing this place and the subsequent expense they can pay for it. Your brother made his own bed. A province supported place will be just as good, especially if he\u2019s not doing this because he wants to, which makes relapse a very real possibility.", "Uh, been through WHAT in real life? Also, why would I chip in for OP's brother's rehab? I said I would do what I can for my own brother. *My own brother. I am not related to these people.*", "Can I ask what Venmo is?", "Another one. I'll venmo my brother some funds when he needs them, since I'm committed to this perspective, since THAT is how the perspective actually works.   \nNice try tho.", "Yep! Exactly", "Oh I see. I'm not American. My surgery is not cosmetic/optional so the costs have to be fully covered by our healthcare system.", "It's probably better for him to not be near them anyway.

My country sucks on healthcare.  \n\nTake care of yourself and don't let your parents bully you.  It sucks that they aren't acknowledging that they have TWO children that are going through serious issues at the moment and could use some support.  Yes, you're financially stable, but I'm sure their emotional support would be appreciated.  At the very least they could not try to put your brother's problem on you while you're focused on your health.\n\nPlease give us an update after your evaluation/treatment to let us know you're okay!", "I won't make that assumption, but they don't sound like the kind of people who I want with me if I have to go to rehab.", "Thanks.
