Also, as someone who has been in your bro\u2019s position, putting him in rehab before he really wants sobriety would be a waste of money, the rehab bed and your efforts. Facing some of the consequences of his actions will tend to make him more ready to get sober IME.", "This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but I would say NTA. Throughout my time in middle school, high school, and the start of college my sister was addicted to heroin, so I understand where you're coming from. She went in and out of rehab probably 6 or 7 times before it stuck. If he isn't making the decision to go and get clean then it just won't stick. I also understand the personal strain it puts on you, addiction affects so many people beyond just the addict. And you're right, you have to put yourself first in this situation because nobody else is going to do that for you. The addict will always be the main focus, and the siblings are always pushed aside but still expected to help. \n\nI do hope he makes that decision for himself and recovers. I also wish you the best of luck on your surgery!", "NTA, but also is it really true that you can \"afford\" it? Having the funds != being able to afford it, especially since you do have upcoming surgery.", "NTA in the slightest, I also have a sibling with drug problems. I wouldn't pay for their rehab, their anything besides maybe a meal here or there. I wouldn't let them stay in my house overnight even. I still love them but my life has no time for someone else's addiction.", "NTA. He actually has to put in some effort", "NTA - You have your own health issues you need to focus on and have no idea how that will affect your financial stability since you're not even sure how bad your condition is.  You certainly can't count on your parents to help you out if you're out of work for an extended time or have medical bills your insurance won't cover if they're already coming to you for money.\n\nEven if you were healthy and stable, this wouldn't be your responsibility.  I might go with N A H in that case because them asking you would at least make sense.  Never hurts to ask and all that.  But knowing your current situation and still trying to get money from you firmly makes them the A H.\n\nI'm sure they can find a cheaper rehab, maybe one with a sliding scale since your brother is a full blown adult in poverty, so your parents income wouldn't matter if he was checking himself into a facility that allowed sliding scale or financial aid.  But in the end, if your brother isn't the one asking to go to rehab, it's not going to work anyway.", "NTA. Nobody can save him, he has to save himself.", "NTA. Not your responsibility, so many addicts just go in and out of rehab so much money wasted.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is in a shit situation and you could help him out, but it certainly isn\u2019t your obligation and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel guilty for not wanting to pay to fix your brother\u2019s issues. It\u2019s an unreasonable expectation that your parents are putting on you.", "NTA", "NTA - is he the golden child? It sounds like it. Like you said, you have enough to deal with.", "NTA-absolutely not. Your parents are AHs for even asking for money from their kid on behalf of their other kid!! Your brother is an adult. If he wants to borrow money from you, he should be doing the asking himself. He\u2019s not 10yo.", "NTA why is he too good for public rehab?\n\nIt is not a choice between no rehab and pay for the private rehab. \n\nHe can go to public rehab for free. Which is coincidentally within his budget. Doesn\u00b4t that work out nicely?", "NTA.  But your parents are. I have read some of your comments. The closer private upscale rehab is not any better than the further away free rehab. Your parents are most likely his enablers, and if he doesn\u2019t want the help, even overdosing doesn\u2019t mean rock bottom, no rehab is going to work no matter where it is located, and how pretty it is. I wouldn\u2019t waste your money. I have been there with my brother so I am speaking from experience. A lot of money was wasted on upscale rehabs, free rehabs, outpatient rehab, and nothing stuck. Most times my brother was persuaded to go for legal reasons. My brother overdosed and passed away five years ago. I love him and I hope he is now at peace, but darn he put our family through hell. Don\u2019t let your brother do that to you Op. Good luck with you surgery and take care!", "WNBTA   NTA - *He needs to want rehab. Only he can walk this path*. Check out free Al-Anon to understand this.  Not once did you mention his view on this new rehab opportunity. You can pour a $1M into rehab but it will be wasted because he needs to do the work. Once you pay the rehab bill in full you will not be reimbursed...by the agency, your parents, your brother. Like you money was lite on fire.\n\nYou're under pressure, I get it. Your parents sound desperate and are willing to risk your health by funding his rehab....this is atrocious. They aren't emotionally grounded right now. YOU matter. Attend counseling so you are supported through your priorities and address your conflicted feelings (this is normal) about your brother. This will give you strength, skills and insight should he not be revived this year. He has to reach his personal lowest human function and want help. There are tons of free local programs and housing he qualifies for (in the US) that Medicaid pays for. Has he taken steps to secure basic human needs: housing, food, recovery, AA meetings (a sponsor)?  Best to you.", "NTA\n\nNot your responsibility, especially if he is unwilling to recognize his own addiction issues.\n\nSucks, but they need to look into affordable treatment and/or contact local sources for help.", "If he has no job and is basically homeless, social services/medical assistance may be able to send him somewhere.\n\nYou need to deal with you, and it is horrid that your parents are harassing their child that is about to go in for heart surgery.\n\nNTA", "Your country is the AH, for making you pay for rehab in the first place.   \n\n\nIf you could afford it but just don't care, you're kind of an AH sister.

Basically, they have two kids with absolutely massive problems they can't solve, both facing death.\n\nI think I'm their panic they have latched onto rehab as the miracle fix. If they can just somehow, magically, get him into rehab, everything will be better. It's something they can control, with actionable items they can tackle and check off. Having you help pay would be checking off the \"fix sibling relationship!\" and \"prove we were good parents because OP wound up a generous person and our kids like each other!\" boxes. \n\nBut you have too many things to deal with in your own.

Getting treatment should be the priority, not trying to get him into a more upscale place.", "\"Prefers the upscale\"...what a bougie perspective. They can want a lot but there is no funding to support this. Your $$ is for your health.
