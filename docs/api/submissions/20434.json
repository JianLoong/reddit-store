Whaaaaaat. Calm TF down.  Don\u2019t marry someone you\u2019ve only been dating for 7 months. Don\u2019t marry someone who would propose after only 7 months.

First off 7 months is WAY too soon to do a trip with your son and partner together. 2nd You're sitter has their own life and it is not a priority to babysit for you.

A sitter does not love Evan. A sitter watches Evan for money. This is not a life changing event for the sitter.

It\u2019s not his life being changed and it\u2019s not his family, AND HES ONLY A BABYSITTER.

The biggest thing here too, is the lack of caring about how your son feels.. as long as everything is convenient for YOU.. everyone else can just flake off right? Including your child. I\u2019m definitely seeing why your ex divorced you and won custody because you clearly put your needs above anyone else\u2019s. Not because \u201che has money \u201c a parent can be poor as a church mouse and still win custody of a child.   You\u2019re in here speaking for yourself, your son, your sitter.. and it seems as long as you get your way.. and everyone bends to you it\u2019s all good? You need some serious self reflection and to think of your child and what his wants and needs before your own. Why in the world are you even taking him if all you\u2019re going to do is stick him in day camp?!?!? Leave him at home with his father where he belongs instead of some trip where he\u2019s apparently a inconvenience to be ignored by you anyway..
