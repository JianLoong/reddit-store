Haha your mom is just like how my dad used to be.\nTo a point I'd literally chose to walk 5 hours to get home just so he'd be out for work in the morning and leave me alone.\nWell I left home to live by myself immediately after finishing school.\nThat was many years ago, I told him the truth one time and we had a good laugh about it. I'm sure she genuinely worried about you, and being free to be out and about to have fun, connect with friends might even be \"unusual\" to her depending on her upbringing. But you're an adult and like you said, you only live once. Just let her know you'll never do anything stupid and that's all she needs to know.", "YTA, there wasn't in my opinion a need to call her crazy to her face. Sure she is being overbearing and should habe more respect for you and the fact your an adult but turning around and acting like a child and resorting to name calling just seems petty. In my opinion you can't  really want to be treated like an adult while acting like a child. To be clear I don't think you're wrong in what your're doing, just in calling her crazy.

Were you not allowed to go out because you were often accused of not being able or trustworthy enough to \"do the right thing\" in relation to your diabetes?
