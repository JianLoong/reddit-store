I really don't know who asked you to do that beside yourself.", "He\u2019s not worried about his daughter he is worried about this guy blowing his cash on a woman he can\u2019t have sex with. \n\nWhich is pretty gross and weird for her father to be concerned about imo.", "What are you talking about?  I shouldn't have spent money?  Are you deliberately trying to pretend I meant spending money on women?  Because I don't do that.  Read what I actually said.", "Oof, so not even worried about the friend\u2019s reaction to feeing he\u2019d been \u201cled on\u201d and his daughter\u2019s safety?  Weird dad. \n\nOn the plus side, thank you, that info definitely helped relieve some of my anxiety.", "NTA i appreciate you looking out for the other kid's feelings too because she could lose a good friend.", "Not the asshole, by ignoring your claims outright, she is taking advantage of this poor boy who will inevitably get his heart broken. As her father, even if she's an adult  you must teach her to behave properly", "This is what r/NiceGuys looks like when they become fathers. Stop empathising with some random dude over your daughter, who is a living, breathing human and deserves authentic friendships and to be herself instead of setting up her life around the possible feelings of a male friend. You're not even concerned for her having a fake friend, your concerned over the potential heartbreak of some dude\n\nBig YTA"]}
