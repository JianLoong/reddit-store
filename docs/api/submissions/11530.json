People's incomes and circumstances can differ massively. Her friend might have a huge amount of disposable income, she might have very little. If her friend can afford to treat her, and is fine with her not treating him back, what on earth is wrong with that? For all we know, he spoils all of his friends in the same way. I really don't see how that makes OP's daughter a bad person in your eyes.", "With this comment he\u2019s really starting to give off \u201cnice guy\u201d vibes. A girl can\u2019t be nice to a guy without leading him on? SHE should know better? Gross.", "\"You can pull him aside\"  why are you suggesting this man involves himself in his daughters friendships? What right does he have to pull someone aside and have a word when she's explicitly asked him to keep out of it? What are you trying to achieve here?", "NEVER. OUT. SOMEONE. *NEVER!*", "Totally untrue. Imagine if he really is just her friend and that\u2019s it like she says. Itd be super weird if she feels that\u2019s the established dynamic but decides to announce she\u2019s not interested. Imagine your friend coming up to you out of the blue and being like I\u2019d never ever date you don\u2019t even consider it, when you never had that thought in the first place. If my friend told me they had no interest in dating me even though I never expressed any I\u2019d feel like they were just trying to tear me down for no reason. Like i said it should never be on women to assume a man\u2019s intentions, regardless of how clear someone else thinks the man\u2019s intentions are. What\u2019s the old saying\u2026 when you assume you make an A out of u and me.", "It\u2019s okay.", "Could also be gift giving is his way to show anyone affection, not just someone he is romantically trying to pursue. I love giving my friends gifts and seeing their reactions!", "Or perhaps she functions as his wingman. Or wingwoman in this case.", "Sounds like she might be partially closeted. OP said a comment that she wasn't out to her mother. That she keeps her sexuality close to her chest. So might be still in the closet. \n\nAnd if she is I wouldn't be surprised if the best friend is aware she's lesbian and is helping her stay safe by doing what he is or is trying to cheer her up since she feels she has to stay even partially in the closet.", "So it's a thing that HE'S willingly doing that's making you uncomfortable, not your daughter, but you think SHE'S the problem and he's the \"poor boy\"?", "friends can spend money on their friends if they can afford it", "How is that your daughter\u2019s responsibility or problem?", "Do you think she's using him for gifts and money?", "I\u2019m bored of you. I don\u2019t need to justify my opinions to you. \ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18", "Nothing. What are you trying to achieve? \n\nI notice you didn\u2019t quote the entirety of my statement? Is that because I specified the outcome of the action and that doesn\u2019t align with this argument you\u2019re trying to have?", "That is not how teen boys think. \n\nThey think \u201cwhy not both?\u201d Instead of picking one.  You don\u2019t shower your \u201cwing woman\u201d with hundreds of dollars in gifts.", "I hadn't thought of that, her friend might be helping to provide her with cover until she's ready and safe to come out. Yet another reason for OP to stay in his lane.", "\"You can pull him aside next time he\u2019s over and tell him \u201cShe\u2019s gay\u201d but that will end in a broken relationship with your daughter.\"  why are you suggesting this man involves himself in his daughters friendships? What right does he have to pull someone aside and have a word when she's explicitly asked him to keep out of it? What are you trying to achieve here?\n\n\n\nThere, fixed it for you. There's your full quote. It doesn't change my point at all. My point is why pull someone aside, tell them your daughter is gay, ending in a broken relationship with your own daughter, when your daughter has already explicitly asked you to keep out of it?", "Unfortunately its still quite common. And acceptable to the community as LONG As it's well communicated and everyone's honest and truthful about the situation", "Again. I already answered this question. Get off my dick."]}
