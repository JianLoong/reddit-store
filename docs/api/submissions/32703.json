I don't expect more from her so this is fine by me. \n\nRecently we were out with some friends, and we played some sorta game about hypothetical scenarios. It was fun and we were all laughing.

The question you were proposed required an answer predicting your own emotional response to a scenario.  It wasn't a question of morality in which lying would have detrimental effects.\n\nAnd though you answered truthfully, abiding 100% by a moral code to tell the truth, what you failed to do in the process was to consider someone else's feelings, which should be a whole other facet of trying to be a good person.\n\nIf you had stopped first to consider the feelings of Gwen and then taken that into consideration in your response, perhaps you could have found a way to respond to the question both without lying and without hurting her feelings.\n\nInstead, because her feelings just didn't even occur to you or you didn't take the time to process that, you embarrassed her publicly by revealing that she had less value to you, from her perspective, than a dog.  It doesn't really matter that it is your dog, and you have a very special bond, to her, in front of all of your friends, you made a comparison that was unfavorable of her.\n\nThis would be the one situation in which telling a white lie . . . or using humor to diffuse the situation . . . or just any clever method of avoidance in answering the question altogether would have been a much better response to the situation than how you responded. \n\nAnd further, what kind of friend is David?  It sounds like he knew or suspected strongly how you might answer and purposefully put you in this situation and the expected outcome.  Why would he do that?  What does he gain?  Does he dislike your girlfriend or secretly want to be her next boyfriend?  Does he dislike you, is jealous, or prefers you single?\n\nImagine the outcome if you had responded in any of these ways to your friend's ridiculous question:\n\n1. *Alright, Dude, let's ask a question in which the answer is not so obvious.  Next question?* **(deflection)**\n2. *\"That's pretty funny.  I think we all know the answer to that one,\"* and then kiss Gwen. **(white lie)**\n3. *\"That's a really ridiculous question, David.  We all know that Rufus is never going to leave me.\"*  And then laugh really hard and kiss the girl.  **(humor)**\n\nAnd, finally, you were wrong.  Put yourself in her shoes and think about how you would feel.  You need to apologize and consider that this may be something very hard to come back from.  She will need reassurances that you care and value her.", "You told your truth\n\nBut you also now have to deal with the consequences of your truth and that you hurt your partner", "Personal I think hypothetical games are like playing roulette.

Don't be an asshole and try to justify it by saying \"I was just being honest\" in the next one.", "YTA. Look, I understand your dog is very valuable to you, but her anger is justified in a way. She probably sees this relationship as very serious relationship (2 years) and hoped you saw her as worth that\n\nAdditionally, she also probably doesn\u2019t want to be compared to, or more highly valued, than a dog. I can sympathize with the fact that this dog has been with you through so much, but you should have made it clear that that question wasn\u2019t a fair one, and should have mentioned that those two cannot be compared and put in the same category.

There are moments in life where you should absolutely lie, or withhold the full truth, with careful consideration of the context/consequences.\n\nIn this case, it would've been to spare your girlfriend's feelings. There would have been zero harm to lie, or deflect that question if you weren't comfortable doing so.\n\nAs for the people who are saying NTA - nobody is saying you can't love your dog more than your partner. Heck, I've been there. But the crux of the situation is not whether the OP is an AH for feeling that way. The OP is an AH for thinking honesty was the best policy in this circumstance, and valued it above the feelings of someone else he supposedly cares about.", "NTA, your beastie saved your life.", "NTA it\u2019s always pets over people man good on ya", "Telling the truth is never wrong ... but I probably would have lied to keep the peace.", "I\u2019m gonna say a gentle YTA.

Your girlfriend is entitled to feel upset because she heard that she\u2019s second place in your life. That\u2019s not nice to hear. But a relationship with a dog and a person is not the same. \nYour answer should have been different. Should have been more diplomatic and considerate about how this will affect her. Tell her how important your dog is to you and why and the way she\u2019s important to you as a partner. Don\u2019t put them both in the same category.", "YTA. Gwen is justifiably hurt.

You've had your dog 10 years, been through tough times, and known your girlfriend only 2 years. And your dog depends on you in a whole other way than she does. You two have been the only things eachother had at tomes. Also when losing a dog it means them dying, while losing a girlfriend means breaking up usually. A relationship can always end, pets are there until one of you die. I would never be more sad to lose someone I meet today, than my dearest cat I've had for years and who depend on me, or my family who I've known my whole life. \n\nThe person who asked the question is the biggest asshole.\n\nGwen is a drama queen. It's not like you wouldn't be sad to lose her, or you ever actually had to choose. She sounds like a \"would you love me if I were a worm\" type of girlfriend.", "If you want loyalty, get a dog!

I can see how and why neurotypical people are saying you should've told a white lie but if you're anything like me I'm guessing it was just not something that was *possible* for you to do at that moment. You would've felt like a deer stuck in headlights and just blurted out the answer that was the actual truth. On the other hand, I can totally see why your gf is mad and upset over this. It feels like a slap on her face and probably embarrassed her a great deal in front of so many people. I do wonder why your \"friend\" asked such an asinine question in the first place.", "All the people saying you are the asshole haven't got a clue.

But it doesn\u2019t make it ok. I don\u2019t think you should have lied, either, bc then this poor woman would be thinking she has a place in your life that she actually does not.

That being said, I understand your dog has been there for you and is your everything, but you need to see that for Gwen you are her everything and if you are serious about her and plan to make her your wife someday, prioritizing a dog over her was hard to hear. It sounds like she is more committed to you than you are to her, you can't change how you feel in this situation, like you said you answered truthfully, but honestly man, your long-term girlfriend should be your #1 priority- over a dog.", "YTA. Are you still a teenager? This is a rookie mistake. Just use common sense. Your dog won\u2019t get hurt if you chose your gf. He won\u2019t understand you.Nothing wrong with a white lie just be truthful when you\u2019re presented with the situation when you have to choose.

You sound like a very hurtful person.", "NTA.\n\nMost people (if they answer honestly, like you did) are gonna value their pets over their partners, cos they provide a level of loyalty and comfort that humans don't provide.  \nYour friend asked a loaded question that would obviously get you into trouble if you answered a certain way, which is exactly what happened (and personally, I'd be asking myself why he asked *that* question specifically).\n\nI completely understand why your girlfriend is upset, but at the same time there really was no right or wrong answer to the question.  \nYou answer her, you lie to her. You answer the dog, you hurt her. You tell a white lie, you're likely to get away with it but it's still misleading.\n\nHonestly, whilst I understand her hurt, I also think she's got the wrong end of the stick.  \nThe question was who would hurt more to lose. She seems to think that pain equals value, and that's not always true.  \nLosing a pet is always different to losing a person.
