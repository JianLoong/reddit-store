{"id": 6995, "submission_id": "108ilm9", "title": "AITA for admitting to my son that I never wanted to have a child?", "selftext": "So, I saw a post here that reminded me of my situation and it made me think to post. I have a 15 year old son Jakob. When I was 18 I married a classmate I was dating, we were stupid teenagers and I got pregnant. He really wanted to have a kid so I was pressured into having Jakob even though I hated being pregnant and taking care of him. Our families were so disappointed that they demanded we give the baby up to somebody so that we can focus on our education. We didn't and Jakob was about six months old when his dad died in a motorcycle crash.\n\nAbout a year after I gave Jakob up to my great-aunt, she legally adopted him and my life got so much better. I finished up my education and by the time I was 26, I became the manager at a club. When Jakob was 11, my great-aunt was diagnosed with an illness and it was determined she could no longer care for him.\n\nSo, as per her wishes, I took Jakob back and began working nights so that I could care for him even though I hate working nights. I have changed my entire schedule to accommodate for him. I never wanted to take somebody to basketball practice, drop off and pick up a bunch of kids in a carpool or have noisy Xbox games played through my apartment. But I do now and have sacrificed my entire existence for him.\n\nAnd here's the kicker, I actually started to enjoy it because Jakob was so great and up until a year ago I was even thinking this was a nice way to live. And then something changed, he got rude, starts throwing his backpack when he comes home, will throw away the lunch I make him, will swear and he won't even hug me anymore. We had an argument yesterday because he started watching WWE real loud instead of doing his chores and that woke me up way too early and I got very upset when he said I wanted to give him away because I don't. I admitted that I never wanted to have him but he's not some toy I can just toss away.\n\nBut instead of thinking about what I said, he just started crying really badly and this morning he wouldn't even get out of bed and go to school, he just won't stop hugging me and crying. I've called in sick for tonight but I'm just wondering if I was wrong to handle it how I did. One of my friends said she would have divorced her husband if he said that to their son.\n\nEdit at 12:31 PM: I get it. I accept the judgment of YTA. I'll just use this edit as one last time to make my point clear: I love my son and I do want him in my life, that is the point I was trying to make.", "created_utc": 1673379193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ilm9/aita_for_admitting_to_my_son_that_i_never_wanted/", "score": 607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a teenager with big feelings and hormones, his swearing and bag tossing are normal teen things. \n\nWhen he was very vulnerable, decided to hurt him right at the core of his being.You confirmed his worst fears: he was never wanted by the people who created him.

As and adopted person, this was very difficult to read. There have been far less severe things said to me that still haunt me, and I\u2019m 28.

Are you even serious, OP?\n\nI thought the story was about admitting to not planning a kid at first, but then falling in love with them. Then I'd say it was fine as long as the \"but I changed my mind and I love you\" part was stressed enough. But no, that's not the case. You only said \"but I can't because you're not a toy\" even though your actions prove that you CAN because you DID IT ONCE.\n\nIn case you can't figure it out from my comment: YTA", "YTA\n\nClearly your kids is going through something. Did he know you gave him to your aunt when you were young? Did he know this whole time you were his mom? Then to tell him you never wanted kids while he's struggling, wtf is wrong with you. You totally handled the situation wrong and the only thing you can think about is \"I've sacrificed so much for this kid\" well you put yourself in that position when you chose to have a kid at 18 and then chose again to take the kid back when he was 11. Poor kid.", "YTA. You fucked up big time, as everyone said. But you can go to therapy for yourself first and work through the grief of having a child too young that you were not prepared for and felt pressured into having. It\u2019s okay for you to resent the situation, but not your son. Therapy for YOU should be the first priority if your son is currently unwilling to go. This can help you learn how to effectively communicate with your son as well and try to fix some of the damage you have done. My parents said a lot of awful shit to me growing up but my mom learned how to communicate and apologize. And now as an adult, I can see she was flawed and unprepared to parent (as so many are) and it has strengthened our relationship. I do think some day your son will see you in a more compassionate light and maybe even forgive you if you take steps now to work on things. It won\u2019t happen overnight and it will require you taking the lead here, as you should, you\u2019re the adult. Once your son sees your progress in therapy it might make him more comfortable going for himself.", "YTA. This will stick with your kid. I have an older sister and once in an argument my mom told me she wished she 'had stopped at one' (I was unplanned and she has admitted she was terrified of having a second but often calls me her bonus baby) and although she didn't mean it, and it was just heat of the moment when I was being an asshole teen saying what I'm sure was far worse than what she said to me - ive never forgotten it and those words hurt me like no other. The difference between my mom and you though is you DID mean it. And he knows that.", "YTA. You \"started to enjoy\" being a parent because he was such a good kid, then he starts to act out and you, **the adult** threw in his face that a) you never wanted him, b) if you **could**, you would \"toss him away\".\n\nDo you know what's missing in your post by the way? That you love him. Jesus fucking Christ, man, if you *do* love him, be an adult, be a parent, and don't lash out and go nuclear on him ever the fuck again.\n\nApologize profusely, **you** are the one who fucked up here. Was he being annoying? Yes. But fuck, talk about a hurricane over a little spilled water - he poked you and you came back with a bazooka.", "YTA You literally told him he is an unwanted child and that the only reason you don't throw him away is because he is a person and you are legally responsible for him. How else should he have reacted? If my wife told that to our children I would have taken them and left forever.", "I feel for you, but YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s a kid, he has no responsibility for the situation you are in. As his mom it\u2019s very emotionally scarring to say that to him at a young age.", "YTA. Last year, the thing that changed is he\u2019s a teen boy and their hormones play havoc with them. People focus so often on girls\u2019 hormonal changes in puberty but boys experience it too.\n\nAs for what you said: My father said that to me a few times throughout my childhood. I confirmed that those were his feelings when I was an adult. It is soul-destroying growing up with the knowledge that you weren\u2019t wanted. I no longer speak to my parents (for that reason plus loads more) and it has taken me decades to have a semblance of self-esteem.\n\nA lot of pregnancies aren\u2019t planned. A lot of expectant parents don\u2019t feel ready for parenthood. I wasn\u2019t, but my child has asked if I wanted them and I could confidently say I did. I wasn\u2019t expecting them and I hadn\u2019t planned for them, but they were wanted.", "YTA. Look I get that being a parent is difficult. Your son is a teenager, they aren\u2019t always fun. But this kid as been bounced around his entire life and it\u2019s obviously affected him. No matter how upsetting he\u2019s being you don\u2019t need to put it out there that there was ever a time you didn\u2019t want him. When I was 23 my mom during a friendly conversation casually dropped that if she had to do it over again I wouldn\u2019t exist. She had me at 19 and I know it wasn\u2019t easy but that comment was so hurtful that it still stings like 15 years later.", "YTA. This is one of the reasons I am pro Abortion. So parents like you who were irresponsible stop blaming the kids for their actions. Seriously what is wrong with you.\n\nMy mother did want me but she was a bad mkther and would tell 5 year old me \"I am not the child she asked for\". That still sticks with me and i am turning 26 this year.\n\nYou on the ither hand were irresponsible and now putting that kn your child. Way to break down this poor kid.\n\nEDIT: Reading from your comments, you are immature and selfish. People are trying to help you understand how HE is feeling and all you do is defend yourself and think about yourself. Poor child seriously. I feel bad for how he is feeling and is gona have a heavy heavy heavy life ahead of him.\n\nAnd YES please do send him to therapy. Even of you think its no good. At least someone will listen to his feelings. You better start growing up if you want to be in his life now because you will be abusive mentally towards him even if you dont intend it.\n\nI have told my mother alllll the shit she has said and done to me growing up but her response was \"I didn't mean it like that\" or \" it's not what i said or did\". She never toom responsibility for what she did to me and my father. And she did pretty f'ed up sh!t. And you are doing exactly what she did and still does.", "YTA in this post and you're a HUGE ASSHOLE in the comments. Get therapy. Poor kid.", "YTA\n\nThe damage is done now, I unno what to suggest.  I really don't.  I mean, I would have said, find out what's wrong that's making him so ornery and all, but it's a bit late for that.\n\nI think you have to tell him you only said that in anger and you didn't mean it, and try to rebuild the relationship.  Good luck.", "YTA.\n\nHe was already feeling crushing abandonment (whether or not it was justified), and your great-aunt (the caretaker who raised him for most of his life) is no longer in his everyday life. Even though your comment is factually true and even if you said it with the intention to mean something totally different by it, it was nonetheless something that can and inevitably was easily misconstrued due to these feelings of hurt and anxiety he was experiencing when you said it.\n\nMaybe instead of reminding him that you never wanted children, you can get to the root of his behavior.

I can't believe that you would say you \"sacrifice\" anything for your son in a positive way. I'm more willing to believe you expected only the good without the cost of the bad times, but it's the bad times when a child needs their parent to set up the most.", "YTA.\n\nDid you consider someone that knows you gave him up and didn\u2019t want him, told him so while you weren\u2019t around? \n\nStop making excuses.", "YTA\n\nHe only now feels safe for his feels to come out for the years you abandoned him.\n\nIt\u2019s good he\u2019s hugging you, he wants you.\n\nStop saying you didn\u2019t want him, assure him you\u2019re not going anywhere and it\u2019s ok to trust that as well as natural to be afraid it might go away given the past.

Your child's safety psychological, physical, an emotional should be a priority.", "YTA - you are damaging that boy", "YTA\n\nIdk what you\u2019re even on here asking? You said you didn\u2019t want your child now he\u2019s so hysterical he has latched on to you and is crying nonstop.

I have lived my life knowing that my mom never wanted kids and she absolutely never wanted a second kid. Hi, I'm the second kid. I'm sorry, but there is no circumstance in which it is okay to tell a child that they were not wanted, or that they were an accident, or that they were a mistake. They live with that for the rest of their life. Joking or not, it's not okay to say; whether they are old enough to know the truth or not, don't tell them; whether they ask or not, don't be honest with them. Yes, YTA.", "So ..your son didn't go to school and won't stop crying? But you came here wondering if you handled this wrong somehow? Like...did his reaction maybe give you a hint?\n\nYTA.

It\u2019s up to you to be the adult. \n\nIt is horribly cruel to tell your child that you didn\u2019t want to have him (even if your opinion has changed). Especially when you follow it up by criticizing his level of critical analysis of what you said. He\u2019s going through one of the most confusing and difficult times people go through (puberty and young adulthood). Of course he reacted emotionally!", "YTA", "YTA.

Much worse that you just come out and say it to him.", "Yes YTA the answer to this is always yes. Never tell your kid you didn\u2019t want to have him even if it was true but you\u2019ve since changed your mind. And then the added \u201cYou\u2019re not a toy I can just toss away\u201d the unspoken implication is that you wish you could even if that\u2019s not what you mean. Your son has no choice but to rely on you as a caregiver, as a parent. How do you think he feels knowing you think he\u2019s a burden? How do you think he feels now his Great Aunt, who legally adopted him, can\u2019t be his mother anymore? He probably feels passed around even if she can\u2019t help being ill. \n\nWhat changed? Teenagers are moody and annoying. They do this thing where they tell you to get the hell away from them and at the same time are very clingy. Add on the idea (for him) that you didn\u2019t want him and he doesn\u2019t know where to turn when he needs his mom. \n\nI highly suggest you get him some therapy and do all you can to reassure him that he has some stability with you.", "YTA you've never heard of puberty?

You became pregnant in a young age, half a kid by yourself. Now you have to raise a kid although you never really learned how to be a good parent or how to have a good family.\n\nHe is a teen now and I would try to exactly explain this. You did not want to raise a kid and that you are ashamed you haven't been a better mother to him. That you are happy to have him and you want to do your best to make him happy.

Of course he is upset and emotionally distraught.", "Wtf, lady. You have a teenager. Do you remember being a teenager? I cannot believe anyone would say that to their child, regardless of the circumstances, because teenagers ARE CHILDREN ALSO.\n\nJfc. You're the ahole.

It will damage your son for a long time to have heard that.", "Yta, his mood suddenly changed, suggesting he's dealing with something difficult.

You made a bad choice to admit that", ">But I do now and have sacrificed my entire existence for him.\n\nYTA. Yes, this is what happens when you have a child. That's the expectation. You can still have a life, but you are a parent first.\n\nHe's approaching his teen years now. He has a ton of hormones and his brain is developing. And my bet is that if you were willing to say what you said to him? That it isn't the first time you've said something traumatic and awful to him. He's been passed around and has no sense of security, so these little quips that you find innocuous can be **damaging.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I admitted that I never wanted to have him but he's not some toy I can just toss away.\n\nListen. I don't know what to tell you, because if you wrote this and hit enter without understanding what you've done wrong, then you have some fundamental lacking of empathy. No child needs to hear this from their parent. Period. Even if it's true. This is something you could discuss with another adult family member or your therapist (Please god, get a therapist. You need one before you do even more harm to that child.) in confidence, to vent, sure, but the fact that those words came out of your mouth to your child is ... well, awe-inspiringly cruel. You basically conveyed that you only take care of him out of obligation.\n\nHe will never, ever forget you saying that. And you can't take it back.\n\nEdited to add: I noticed most of your responses are extremely selfish. \"I'd want my mom to be honest\" \"I wasn't mean when I was a teenager\". You... really need to work on yourself. Respectfully, please get a therapist. It's time you stopped thinking about you, and started thinking about him.", "YTA. What a shitty thing to say to someone.

You can think that shit but you never say it out loud.", "YTA  And from reading your replies you have the emotional IQ of a potato.  YOU hurt your son in a manner unnecessary and unbecoming of you as a parent.  Which is, like it or not, what you are now.  Seek counseling for both of you and DO better.  You are entirely capable of doing better!", "I mean... Wouldn't you be upset if you were told by your mom she didn't want you?\nThe other stuff sounds like normal teenager attitude.", "YTA. Looking through your comments I get the impression that you are lost and genuinely don\u2019t understand how badly you just failed your son. You just crushed him, he was probably depressed (and I\u2019m guessing so are you)and what he just heard is \u201cI should\u2019ve never been born. Nobody loves me.\u201d Or something similar. You need to apologize and maybe get him and you in therapy. When you get into therapy make sure it\u2019s one who works with him and not over him.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter your intention if your impact was harmful. \n\nAnd I think that you really need to look at the comments, especially your own. You asked for judgement, so why are you fighting so hard trying to prove how you aren\u2019t wrong in this situation? I understand trying to provide context, but you\u2019re arguing with people. All you\u2019re doing is digging a deeper hole for yourself. \n\nI say this all genuinely, because your son deserves a good parent. Getting defensive at everyone giving you insight isn\u2019t going to help at all. You need to try to actually listen, otherwise your son will pull away. And I wouldn\u2019t blame him.", "Um yeah YTA. Why did you take him back if you didn't want to be a parent? You were already out.\n\nI never planned to have kids and I thought very seriously about having an abortion when I did get pregnant but was talked out of it.\n\nHave I said that to my teenage child?\n\nFucking of course not, because that's MY issue, not theirs.", "God this aggravates me and I hope this is fake. I got pregnant when I was 16. I was pressured into keeping the pregnancy by the father and his family. I finished high school but lost the accolades I had been working towards because I was no longer allowed to attend the higher education classes by the district. I lost my scholarships, my friends, my extracurriculars, and any shred of free time I had. I graduated early at 17 because of my academics and started working shitty jobs driving a shitty car and paying almost my whole pay check just for child care. I gave up my life as I knew it. I gave up what I perceived at the time was everything, and it was a lot. But I did it because she didn't have a choice in the matter and frankly any of the other options there were to raise her were shitty people. \n\nShe's ten and she's fucking hilarious.

If so, apologize, correct your behaviour and learn from it - perhaps never say those words again to Jakob, who has gone through so much trauma from the 3 adults who are supposed to love and protect him.\n\nRaising teenagers is tough but your situation is very complex.

It's one thing if you had said that you gave him up initially, but have been so glad to have him back in your life...but you basically made it sound like you didn't want him, but now you have him out of obligation. You definitely need to have a conversation with this kid and make it right. He didn't ask to be born, and he didn't ask to come back. He's a teenager, he's going to be moody sometimes. Do your best to communicate and figure out why...don't lose your shit at him. YTA, make it right.", "YTA.

He will always feel like a disappointment and like he is always searching to be \u2018enough\u2019 for you.\n\nNot to mention you say the earlier days on having him in your care were great, you mean after someone else raised him?

You make changes and sacrifices when you choose to bring a life into this world.

She told me, at 35, that she had resented being a mother and having kids, even though she wouldn't change a thing because she loves me and my sister. But I learned our existence was a huge cause of her unhappiness and depression when we were young and growing up, and that explained the sort of distance I felt with her growing up. I was well into adulthood, and her honesty still hurt me at the core.

I have a 15 year old son Jakob. When I was 18 I married a classmate I was dating, we were stupid teenagers and I got pregnant. He really wanted to have a kid so I was pressured into having Jakob even though I hated being pregnant and taking care of him. Our families were so disappointed that they demanded we give the baby up to somebody so that we can focus on our education. We didn't and Jakob was about six months old when his dad died in a motorcycle crash. \n\nAbout a year after I gave Jakob up to my great-aunt, she legally adopted him and my life got so much better. I finished up my education and by the time I was 26, I became the manager at a club. When Jakob was 11, my great-aunt was diagnosed with an illness and it was determined she could no longer care for him. \n\nSo, as per her wishes, I took Jakob back and began working nights so that I could care for him even though I hate working nights. I have changed my entire schedule to accommodate for him. I never wanted to take somebody to basketball practice, drop off and pick up a bunch of kids in a carpool or have noisy Xbox games played through my apartment. But I do now and have sacrificed my entire existence for him.\n\nAnd here's the kicker, I actually started to enjoy it because Jakob was so great and up until a year ago I was even thinking this was a nice way to live. And then something changed, he got rude, starts throwing his backpack when he comes home, will throw away the lunch I make him, will swear and he won't even hug me anymore. We had an argument yesterday because he started watching WWE real loud instead of doing his chores and that woke me up way too early and I got very upset when he said I wanted to give him away because I don't. I admitted that I never wanted to have him but he's not some toy I can just toss away. \n\nBut instead of thinking about what I said, he just started crying really badly and this morning he wouldn't even get out of bed and go to school, he just won't stop hugging me and crying. I've called in sick for tonight but I'm just wondering if I was wrong to handle it how I did. One of my friends said she would have divorced her husband if he said that to their son.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Yeah. \n\nFamily therapy is a must.", "This poor child has been so traumatized by you and your aunt. Get him help NOW. You should have realized something was going on a year ago when his personality suddenly changed. He\u2019s probably going through some major shit that you\u2019re not even aware of. But instead, you\u2019re arguing with him about the volume of the tv and telling him he wasn\u2019t wanted.", "You have failed this child by not standing up to your boyfriend who was a fellow teen, by not giving him up to a family who wants children and by not being able to have any emotional intelligence in raising him. I feel so bad for him. YTA.", "Instead of telling my daughter she is bad, I tell her she made a bad choice. Everyone makes bad choices. It's how we handle the consequences (hopefully with grace and growth) that make us better people.", "oh fuck off. plenty of people have given you \"actual helpful suggestions\".", "He's 15. Teenagers act out at that age.\n\nPart of the reason he doesn't trust therapy because of his aunt is because he DOESN'T have enough trust in you from the prior abandonment.\n\nI'd recommend you get some therapy and help to better address it.", "Kids act out at 15. It's even worse when their father dies and their mother is a sack of garbage.", "Acting out? Don't you mean, started acting like a normal kid that age?\n\nYou have unrealistic expectations. He's a teenager. NONE of the behavior you listed is abnormal.", "He's a person not a dog from the pound.", ">But to a smart growing young man\n\nThis takes time and also takes effort. If hes misbehaving tehre are other ways to go about this then saying what you said because even if you meant well the first thing you said was you didn't want him and that all he has heard. This goes for everyone kid or adult no one should hear that from a parent.\n\nHes a kid hes still learning and your his parent you need to teach him what to do and what not to do\n\nEdit: hes 15 and you left him witjh your great aunt for that long I thought it was a little bit. You left him for a good while and now think he just tolerate your BS saying that you wished you never had him what is wrong with you honeslty.", "Wow, I hope you\u2019re grateful to your great-aunt for raising a \u201csmart, growing young man\u201d and I hope you remember every day that you get NO credit for the fact that he is doing well. None. \n\nNo one is asking you to lie, OP, but when the truth does nothing but a.) serve to make you feel momentarily better and b.) hurts a person to their core, you can just *not say anything.* And no, unfortunately for you, that doesn\u2019t count as \u201clying by omission,\u201d it\u2019s just \u201cbeing a half-decent human being.\u201d You seem to struggle with that and I hope you and Jakob can get the help you need.\n\nYTA.", "You don\u2019t get to choose what parts of child to love. You love the whiney, cranky, hormonal mess that annoys the shit out of you just as much as the independent kid. Why? Because people are multidimensional and won\u2019t always be perfect and pretty. People aren\u2019t books that you can put on the bookshelf when you don\u2019t want to deal with them. \n\nAlso, why the hell are you working nights if you hate it? Most parents (single or two parent households) work days just fine. You can work days while he\u2019s in school.", "That smart, growing young man is that way because your aunt took care of him, not you.\n\nWith therapy, he may be able to continue being that smart young man.  Telling him you didn't want him basically tells him that his existence is an accident and a burden.  \n\nMy god, how can you not see your error here?!", "But if your great-aunt was still capable of caring for him, he\u2019d still be with her wouldn\u2019t he? You didn\u2019t choose to take him back, you did because you had to. Also you\u2019re complaining about the most minor of inconveniences a kid his age does (needing rides, playing video games a little too loudly). So that tells me you don\u2019t want any aspect of being a parent at any point in a kids life", "That's true, this far you've down waaaay less than the bare minimum.", "You literally described doing the bare minimum.", "I just want to adopt him. Op is clearly not cut out for motherhood and my mom instinct is taking over.", "He\u2019s a teenager. That\u2019s what happened.", "This is very normal behaviour for a 15 year old, I'm going through it atm. As a mum I just have to suck it up and deal with as best I can. It won't last forever but if you give him more trauma by saying shit like this, it will be a lot rougher for everyone", "He became a teenager, that\u2019s normal. Especially for a teenager in his particular circumstances. It would be much stranger if he DIDNT change and become moody, angry, etc.", "It's called being a teenager, genius \ud83d\ude02", "By telling a child you think he's comparable to a toy you can just throw out, yes you are abusing him.", "You've already started unfortunately", "Not knowing you're doing it doesn't mean you're not doing it.\n\nBut to give you the benefit of the doubt here: what's the ratio between positive interactions you have with him where you actually enjoy his company and he yours, and times you're yelling at him for not doing what you want, or complaining because of how much work he is or how disruptive his presence in the home is? Not overall, but just in say the last month or two. How is the time you spend with him split between those two modes of interaction?", "I've never met anyone who *was* fit to be a parent, and that includes you. Enjoy your smug self-righteousness and the massive therapy bill your kids are going to stick you with you prick.", "Lol and she didn't ask to have him. If you were forced to have a child you didn't want, what, you think suddenly you would just be parent of the year?", "When have I not accepted? All I've tried to do is clarify what I meant to people who don't get it.", "Judging by your foaming at the mouth with rage comments, maybe you should be considering therapy too.", "No, but you either take it or leave it. You either take the whole responsibility that you know a kid is, or you abandon him. Playing with him and his feelings while whining doesn't help anyone. She should have stayed out of his life instead of \"sacrificing\" and complain about it constantly. Her own words \"a kid is not a toy\", he's not yours only when convenient.", "We all know what you meant but that is not at all how it came across. This will stay with your son, even if you both think you\u2019ve moved past it. In therapy, I learned both my parents dying especially when I was young is a form of abandonment and where my abandonment issues come from. I wondered how that could be since it\u2019s not like either chose to die and they were physically present until they literally couldn\u2019t be. \n\nIf simple death of a parent is registered by growing brain as abandonment, your mom choosing to give you to a relative and only taking you when you have nowhere else to go is abandonment. And you may have meant to tell your son that you didn\u2019t want to have him but he\u2019s here now and you\u2019re not going to give him up. But what you actually said to a kid who has now been twice abandoned (you giving him to his aunt and then his main caretaker, the aunt, dying) just 1. Reaffirmed the first abandonment because you told him outright you never wanted him which now makes his time with his aunt a solidified abandonment. And 2. that if you had your choice and if he wasn\u2019t a living breathing human you would prefer not to have him. We don\u2019t even have time to get into the ways through this post it seems like you have emotionally neglected (read: abandoned) him.\n\nI say this with the caveat that my own abandonment issues may be clouding this next part. I truly don\u2019t know how you move forward and get past this. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d especially given how intense his reaction has been. The only thing that can help save this relationship is therapy. He\u2019s a kid. Make him go. Do not leave this to fester and hope it heals on its own. That would be the biggest abandonment of all. Go to a therapist and learn how to show up for your kid so you have a shot of getting past this.", "No what you don\u2019t get is that what you are doing is the BARE MINIMUM. You want to be \u201epraised\u201c for it because he changed your life and you did so \u201ewell\u201c when all you did is taking care of your OWN SON. You told him that you didn\u2019t even want him in the first place,  yes, you could\u2019ve lie to him. This is one situation where it\u2019s ok to lie so you could\u2019ve avoided to hurt your son who is clearly traumatized by all of this. On top of that you gaslight him so he feels bad and apologized to YOU when you are in the wrong here. Now tell me, where did you ever accepted anything? Did you even apologized to him sincerely?", "You haven't accepted that you fucked up big time. Stop defending yourself. YOU don't get it.", "You are going to gaslight him, aren\u2019t you? All of your comments screams gaslighting.", "You are the one who doesn\u2019t get that it doesn\u2019t fucking matter what you meant. You caused your son deep pain with your words. If you don\u2019t do something to fix it (aka get him AND YOURSELF therapy), you will lose him permanently one way or another."]}
