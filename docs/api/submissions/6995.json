I have a 15 year old son Jakob. When I was 18 I married a classmate I was dating, we were stupid teenagers and I got pregnant. He really wanted to have a kid so I was pressured into having Jakob even though I hated being pregnant and taking care of him. Our families were so disappointed that they demanded we give the baby up to somebody so that we can focus on our education. We didn't and Jakob was about six months old when his dad died in a motorcycle crash.\n\nAbout a year after I gave Jakob up to my great-aunt, she legally adopted him and my life got so much better. I finished up my education and by the time I was 26, I became the manager at a club. When Jakob was 11, my great-aunt was diagnosed with an illness and it was determined she could no longer care for him.\n\nSo, as per her wishes, I took Jakob back and began working nights so that I could care for him even though I hate working nights. I have changed my entire schedule to accommodate for him. I never wanted to take somebody to basketball practice, drop off and pick up a bunch of kids in a carpool or have noisy Xbox games played through my apartment. But I do now and have sacrificed my entire existence for him.\n\nAnd here's the kicker, I actually started to enjoy it because Jakob was so great and up until a year ago I was even thinking this was a nice way to live. And then something changed, he got rude, starts throwing his backpack when he comes home, will throw away the lunch I make him, will swear and he won't even hug me anymore. We had an argument yesterday because he started watching WWE real loud instead of doing his chores and that woke me up way too early and I got very upset when he said I wanted to give him away because I don't. I admitted that I never wanted to have him but he's not some toy I can just toss away.\n\nBut instead of thinking about what I said, he just started crying really badly and this morning he wouldn't even get out of bed and go to school, he just won't stop hugging me and crying. I've called in sick for tonight but I'm just wondering if I was wrong to handle it how I did. One of my friends said she would have divorced her husband if he said that to their son.\n\nEdit at 12:31 PM: I get it. I accept the judgment of YTA. I'll just use this edit as one last time to make my point clear: I love my son and I do want him in my life, that is the point I was trying to make.", "created_utc": 1673379193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108ilm9/aita_for_admitting_to_my_son_that_i_never_wanted/", "score": 10653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As and adopted person, this was very difficult to read. There have been far less severe things said to me that still haunt me, and I\u2019m 28.

I don't blame him for being hurt. \"I never wanted you in the first place\" doesnt make \"you want to get rid of me\" to far of a stretch, especially since you have to remember you already gave him up once, which he knows, and that causes truama.

Are you even serious, OP?\n\nI thought the story was about admitting to not planning a kid at first, but then falling in love with them. Then I'd say it was fine as long as the \"but I changed my mind and I love you\" part was stressed enough. But no, that's not the case. You only said \"but I can't because you're not a toy\" even though your actions prove that you CAN because you DID IT ONCE.\n\nIn case you can't figure it out from my comment: YTA", "YTA\n\nClearly your kids is going through something. Did he know you gave him to your aunt when you were young? Did he know this whole time you were his mom? Then to tell him you never wanted kids while he's struggling, wtf is wrong with you. You totally handled the situation wrong and the only thing you can think about is \"I've sacrificed so much for this kid\" well you put yourself in that position when you chose to have a kid at 18 and then chose again to take the kid back when he was 11. Poor kid.", "YTA. You fucked up big time, as everyone said. But you can go to therapy for yourself first and work through the grief of having a child too young that you were not prepared for and felt pressured into having. It\u2019s okay for you to resent the situation, but not your son. Therapy for YOU should be the first priority if your son is currently unwilling to go. This can help you learn how to effectively communicate with your son as well and try to fix some of the damage you have done. My parents said a lot of awful shit to me growing up but my mom learned how to communicate and apologize. And now as an adult, I can see she was flawed and unprepared to parent (as so many are) and it has strengthened our relationship. I do think some day your son will see you in a more compassionate light and maybe even forgive you if you take steps now to work on things. It won\u2019t happen overnight and it will require you taking the lead here, as you should, you\u2019re the adult. Once your son sees your progress in therapy it might make him more comfortable going for himself.", "YTA. This will stick with your kid. I have an older sister and once in an argument my mom told me she wished she 'had stopped at one' (I was unplanned and she has admitted she was terrified of having a second but often calls me her bonus baby) and although she didn't mean it, and it was just heat of the moment when I was being an asshole teen saying what I'm sure was far worse than what she said to me - ive never forgotten it and those words hurt me like no other. The difference between my mom and you though is you DID mean it. And he knows that.", "YTA. You \"started to enjoy\" being a parent because he was such a good kid, then he starts to act out and you, **the adult** threw in his face that a) you never wanted him, b) if you **could**, you would \"toss him away\".\n\nDo you know what's missing in your post by the way? That you love him. Jesus fucking Christ, man, if you *do* love him, be an adult, be a parent, and don't lash out and go nuclear on him ever the fuck again.\n\nApologize profusely, **you** are the one who fucked up here. Was he being annoying? Yes. But fuck, talk about a hurricane over a little spilled water - he poked you and you came back with a bazooka.", "YTA You literally told him he is an unwanted child and that the only reason you don't throw him away is because he is a person and you are legally responsible for him. How else should he have reacted? If my wife told that to our children I would have taken them and left forever.", "I feel for you, but YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s a kid, he has no responsibility for the situation you are in. As his mom it\u2019s very emotionally scarring to say that to him at a young age.", "YTA. Last year, the thing that changed is he\u2019s a teen boy and their hormones play havoc with them. People focus so often on girls\u2019 hormonal changes in puberty but boys experience it too.\n\nAs for what you said: My father said that to me a few times throughout my childhood. I confirmed that those were his feelings when I was an adult. It is soul-destroying growing up with the knowledge that you weren\u2019t wanted. I no longer speak to my parents (for that reason plus loads more) and it has taken me decades to have a semblance of self-esteem.\n\nA lot of pregnancies aren\u2019t planned. A lot of expectant parents don\u2019t feel ready for parenthood. I wasn\u2019t, but my child has asked if I wanted them and I could confidently say I did. I wasn\u2019t expecting them and I hadn\u2019t planned for them, but they were wanted.", "YTA. Look I get that being a parent is difficult. Your son is a teenager, they aren\u2019t always fun. But this kid as been bounced around his entire life and it\u2019s obviously affected him. No matter how upsetting he\u2019s being you don\u2019t need to put it out there that there was ever a time you didn\u2019t want him. When I was 23 my mom during a friendly conversation casually dropped that if she had to do it over again I wouldn\u2019t exist. She had me at 19 and I know it wasn\u2019t easy but that comment was so hurtful that it still stings like 15 years later.", "YTA. This is one of the reasons I am pro Abortion. So parents like you who were irresponsible stop blaming the kids for their actions. Seriously what is wrong with you.\n\nMy mother did want me but she was a bad mkther and would tell 5 year old me \"I am not the child she asked for\". That still sticks with me and i am turning 26 this year.\n\nYou on the ither hand were irresponsible and now putting that kn your child. Way to break down this poor kid.\n\nEDIT: Reading from your comments, you are immature and selfish. People are trying to help you understand how HE is feeling and all you do is defend yourself and think about yourself. Poor child seriously. I feel bad for how he is feeling and is gona have a heavy heavy heavy life ahead of him.\n\nAnd YES please do send him to therapy. Even of you think its no good. At least someone will listen to his feelings. You better start growing up if you want to be in his life now because you will be abusive mentally towards him even if you dont intend it.\n\nI have told my mother alllll the shit she has said and done to me growing up but her response was \"I didn't mean it like that\" or \" it's not what i said or did\". She never toom responsibility for what she did to me and my father. And she did pretty f'ed up sh!t. And you are doing exactly what she did and still does.", "YTA in this post and you're a HUGE ASSHOLE in the comments. Get therapy. Poor kid.", "YTA\n\nThe damage is done now, I unno what to suggest.  I really don't.  I mean, I would have said, find out what's wrong that's making him so ornery and all, but it's a bit late for that.\n\nI think you have to tell him you only said that in anger and you didn't mean it, and try to rebuild the relationship.  Good luck.", "YTA.\n\nHe was already feeling crushing abandonment (whether or not it was justified), and your great-aunt (the caretaker who raised him for most of his life) is no longer in his everyday life. Even though your comment is factually true and even if you said it with the intention to mean something totally different by it, it was nonetheless something that can and inevitably was easily misconstrued due to these feelings of hurt and anxiety he was experiencing when you said it.\n\nMaybe instead of reminding him that you never wanted children, you can get to the root of his behavior.

I can't believe that you would say you \"sacrifice\" anything for your son in a positive way. I'm more willing to believe you expected only the good without the cost of the bad times, but it's the bad times when a child needs their parent to set up the most.", "YTA.\n\nDid you consider someone that knows you gave him up and didn\u2019t want him, told him so while you weren\u2019t around? \n\nStop making excuses.", "YTA\n\nHe only now feels safe for his feels to come out for the years you abandoned him.\n\nIt\u2019s good he\u2019s hugging you, he wants you.\n\nStop saying you didn\u2019t want him, assure him you\u2019re not going anywhere and it\u2019s ok to trust that as well as natural to be afraid it might go away given the past.

I'm sorry, but there is no circumstance in which it is okay to tell a child that they were not wanted, or that they were an accident, or that they were a mistake. They live with that for the rest of their life.

And then the added \u201cYou\u2019re not a toy I can just toss away\u201d the unspoken implication is that you wish you could even if that\u2019s not what you mean.

How do you think he feels now his Great Aunt, who legally adopted him, can\u2019t be his mother anymore? He probably feels passed around even if she can\u2019t help being ill. \n\nWhat changed? Teenagers are moody and annoying. They do this thing where they tell you to get the hell away from them and at the same time are very clingy.

Of course he is upset and emotionally distraught.", "Wtf, lady. You have a teenager. Do you remember being a teenager? I cannot believe anyone would say that to their child, regardless of the circumstances, because teenagers ARE CHILDREN ALSO.\n\nJfc. You're the ahole.

You can still have a life, but you are a parent first.\n\nHe's approaching his teen years now. He has a ton of hormones and his brain is developing. And my bet is that if you were willing to say what you said to him? That it isn't the first time you've said something traumatic and awful to him.

I don't know what to tell you, because if you wrote this and hit enter without understanding what you've done wrong, then you have some fundamental lacking of empathy. No child needs to hear this from their parent. Period. Even if it's true. This is something you could discuss with another adult family member or your therapist (Please god, get a therapist. You need one before you do even more harm to that child.) in confidence, to vent, sure, but the fact that those words came out of your mouth to your child is ... well, awe-inspiringly cruel. You basically conveyed that you only take care of him out of obligation.\n\nHe will never, ever forget you saying that. And you can't take it back.\n\nEdited to add: I noticed most of your responses are extremely selfish. \"I'd want my mom to be honest\" \"I wasn't mean when I was a teenager\".

You can think that shit but you never say it out loud.", "YTA  And from reading your replies you have the emotional IQ of a potato.  YOU hurt your son in a manner unnecessary and unbecoming of you as a parent.  Which is, like it or not, what you are now.  Seek counseling for both of you and DO better.  You are entirely capable of doing better!", "I mean... Wouldn't you be upset if you were told by your mom she didn't want you?\nThe other stuff sounds like normal teenager attitude.", "YTA. Looking through your comments I get the impression that you are lost and genuinely don\u2019t understand how badly you just failed your son. You just crushed him, he was probably depressed (and I\u2019m guessing so are you)and what he just heard is \u201cI should\u2019ve never been born. Nobody loves me.\u201d Or something similar. You need to apologize and maybe get him and you in therapy. When you get into therapy make sure it\u2019s one who works with him and not over him.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter your intention if your impact was harmful. \n\nAnd I think that you really need to look at the comments, especially your own. You asked for judgement, so why are you fighting so hard trying to prove how you aren\u2019t wrong in this situation? I understand trying to provide context, but you\u2019re arguing with people. All you\u2019re doing is digging a deeper hole for yourself. \n\nI say this all genuinely, because your son deserves a good parent. Getting defensive at everyone giving you insight isn\u2019t going to help at all. You need to try to actually listen, otherwise your son will pull away. And I wouldn\u2019t blame him.", "Um yeah YTA. Why did you take him back if you didn't want to be a parent? You were already out.\n\nI never planned to have kids and I thought very seriously about having an abortion when I did get pregnant but was talked out of it.\n\nHave I said that to my teenage child?\n\nFucking of course not, because that's MY issue, not theirs.", "God this aggravates me and I hope this is fake. I got pregnant when I was 16. I was pressured into keeping the pregnancy by the father and his family. I finished high school but lost the accolades I had been working towards because I was no longer allowed to attend the higher education classes by the district. I lost my scholarships, my friends, my extracurriculars, and any shred of free time I had. I graduated early at 17 because of my academics and started working shitty jobs driving a shitty car and paying almost my whole pay check just for child care. I gave up my life as I knew it. I gave up what I perceived at the time was everything, and it was a lot.

It's one thing if you had said that you gave him up initially, but have been so glad to have him back in your life...but you basically made it sound like you didn't want him, but now you have him out of obligation. You definitely need to have a conversation with this kid and make it right. He didn't ask to be born, and he didn't ask to come back. He's a teenager, he's going to be moody sometimes.

You make changes and sacrifices when you choose to bring a life into this world.

She told me, at 35, that she had resented being a mother and having kids, even though she wouldn't change a thing because she loves me and my sister. But I learned our existence was a huge cause of her unhappiness and depression when we were young and growing up, and that explained the sort of distance I felt with her growing up. I was well into adulthood, and her honesty still hurt me at the core.

I have a 15 year old son Jakob. When I was 18 I married a classmate I was dating, we were stupid teenagers and I got pregnant. He really wanted to have a kid so I was pressured into having Jakob even though I hated being pregnant and taking care of him. Our families were so disappointed that they demanded we give the baby up to somebody so that we can focus on our education. We didn't and Jakob was about six months old when his dad died in a motorcycle crash. \n\nAbout a year after I gave Jakob up to my great-aunt, she legally adopted him and my life got so much better. I finished up my education and by the time I was 26, I became the manager at a club. When Jakob was 11, my great-aunt was diagnosed with an illness and it was determined she could no longer care for him. \n\nSo, as per her wishes, I took Jakob back and began working nights so that I could care for him even though I hate working nights. I have changed my entire schedule to accommodate for him. I never wanted to take somebody to basketball practice, drop off and pick up a bunch of kids in a carpool or have noisy Xbox games played through my apartment. But I do now and have sacrificed my entire existence for him.\n\nAnd here's the kicker, I actually started to enjoy it because Jakob was so great and up until a year ago I was even thinking this was a nice way to live. And then something changed, he got rude, starts throwing his backpack when he comes home, will throw away the lunch I make him, will swear and he won't even hug me anymore. We had an argument yesterday because he started watching WWE real loud instead of doing his chores and that woke me up way too early and I got very upset when he said I wanted to give him away because I don't. I admitted that I never wanted to have him but he's not some toy I can just toss away. \n\nBut instead of thinking about what I said, he just started crying really badly and this morning he wouldn't even get out of bed and go to school, he just won't stop hugging me and crying. I've called in sick for tonight but I'm just wondering if I was wrong to handle it how I did. One of my friends said she would have divorced her husband if he said that to their son.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's the whole issue. She didn't gave him up to adoption. She left him with a relative, the relative got sick and she got him back because that was the only option.

They both sat me down and said \u201cthat\u2019s ok, maternal instinct doesn\u2019t really come naturally in our family.\u201d And told me neither of them wanted children, they just felt obligated to have them, they were honest about considering abortion with all of their kids but something always held them back, and they were forever grateful they never did.  It was such a good conversation because 1. They were honest with me and 2. Able to understand why I don\u2019t want my own kids and 3. Were putting zero pressure on me to have kids. Even now at 26 when I\u2019m copping mad pressure from the rest of the family to marry my partner and have kids my mum and grandma are always in my corner shutting it down, I love and appreciate them so much for that.

My stepdad read him a goddamn riot act over that statement, by the way.

OP is a complete asshole.", "Tbf she hasn't parented him through early tantrum phases etc so she has no idea what to expect.\n\nStill shitty choice of wording though.", "Get some therapy.  I know that gets tossed around a lot, but it will help you unpack your emotions around her and figure out how to set boundaries on care and the amou t of relationship you want/deserve with her.  You. Are. Not. Obligated. To. Care. For. Her. Because. She. Birthed. You.  \n\nI truly hope you can come to some peace here.  \ud83d\udc99", "61 years old and my DNA donor just died. Stepmother wants to keep up the pretense he gave a shit about me and my family for the funeral. (spoiler: he didn't.) I refuse to, but yes, I still feel guilt. \n\nIt's ridiculous but real.", "I plan to move away.", "I will never feel guilt for having nothing to do with my dad, he's currently living in a camper in a neighboring town, but idgaf. He has earned everything he's had coming to him. Family is who you make it and just because someone birthed you or sperm donated you doesn't obligate you to do anything for them. It's harsh, but I never asked to be born, I never asked to raise my younger sisters for years, and I never asked to be financially responsible for my family. You didn't ask either.", "I remember telling my dad once that I knew I was never wanted. It's been more than 40 years since he said it, but I still remember it as if it had just happened.\n\nHe said, \" Oh, no, at first you were wanted very much!\" Then he realized what he had just said and he clammed up.\n\nI was 20 years old then.  All I wanted to know was what I had done to become unwanted and unloved. He never told me.", "I feel the same. Sorry you have a similar experience. I think it's important to keep that boundary. Not everyone needs to or wants to have kids. \n\nI want to be a Mom very badly. But medical issues will prevent that the traditional route. I try to give that love and attention to my nephews and niece. And to the kids of my friends.", "And the way she described his crying like it was annoying her. Ugh", "The biggest downside of that, though, was the age at which she did it. Being taken from your primary care giver and given to someone else after you've already bonded but before traditional weaning age is one of the most significant risk factors for attachment disorders.", "Yeah, there's never a best option to do when someone has a kid they didn't want. Everyone gets fucked in such scenario.", "Funny how caring and awesome parents can raise children without traumas and that have good relationships with others as adults, right? I'm really, really lucky. :)", "Good parenting right here! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "My mom told us that she wanted only girls because (in her experience) boys never took care of their mothers and it was always up to the girl. She didn't want her son to abandon her and wanted atleast one of her kids to take care of her after she got old. I'm not excusing her actions, I'm just trying to shed some light.", "Actually, him starting to \u2018misbehave\u2019 may have been a signal that he was finally feeling comfortable - because Mom was finally starting to enjoy parenting. When he was being an angel was actually just him masking 24/7 to stave off abandonment. They say kids behave the worst for their parents because they are their *safe space* and they feel *comfortable* acting themselves because they know home is always going to be there. It wasn\u2019t until recently he felt that way (likely due to mom\u2019s attitude change). \n\nBut that\u2019s all gone now. Lucky for mom, he might start being a perfect kid again! /s", "I just cannot get over the next day, the sickness of child desperately trying to get confirmation that he is wanted and loved\u2026.", "Sounds to me like thats where you got the neurospice from lol", "I feel guilty, a little, occasionally, but intellectually I know it was the right decision.", "Curious about her location. Blue and red America are SO different when it comes to family planning issues. I have a little kid in Seattle, where people have 1-2 kids max and pour time, energy, and resources into them. I am visiting my sister in ultra anti choice eastern Tennessee and have seen several flagrantly dangerous parenting practices out in public, who knows what\u2019s going on in private. The mind boggles. Why force people to have kids if investing in them isn\u2019t a top priority?", "That's fair and I agree, from Jakob's perspective she did abandon him and OP has no real sense of the damage that did to him, hence her cruel words and then bewilderment at his reaction. Hopefully this causes her to think more deeply about the life Jakob has had and what effect her absence has done to him", "So am I. I heard back from my kid almost immediately, \"love you, too.\" Warmed my heart.", "That is precious! My son loves baking with me. It\u2019s even better when he bakes with dad \u2014 that\u2019s what progress looks like IMO", "I kinda hate that she\u2019s right but I\u2019m hopeful my son\u2019s generation carves a different path. We also have long term care insurance since he\u2019s an only child.", "I\u2019ve heard that too. I long for a girl and even if she ruined my body, I\u2019d love her as much as I love the son I already have.

Thank you for bringing it to my attention.", "Yeah it's really fucking me up, him thinking he is unloved, and trying to get love and physical affection from *the very person* he believes not to love him, *because he has no one else to turn to*\n\nEvery single thing about this is fucking heartbreaking. \ud83d\ude4d\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "It's clear from your comments that you're a loving mom.

YOU TOLD YOUR SON HE WASN'T WANTED!!!!\n\nMy mom once told me she was ashamed of me and to this day I can't forgive her for it, mind you I'm the youngest of 3, she was advised to stop having children for health reasons and still had me.", "This belongs on r/iamatotalpieceofshit", "It\u2019s also not the type of thing to blurt out during an argument.\n\nA lot of people are saying she never should have told her son she didn\u2019t want him (initially), but like, he\u2019s not stupid. He was put up for adoption for 11 years and only taken back when his aunt got sick. I think a gentle, and perhaps a bit sugar coated, but overall honest conversation was due eventually but this was so not the way to do it.", "Going off her comments, she's not apologetic at all. She's annoyed because it's impossible to ignore his reaction to her statements. She won't pretend to be, either, she doesn't want to lie and evidently feels very strongly about that.", ">He really wanted to have a kid so ***I was pressured into having Jakob*** even though I hated being pregnant and taking care of him. ***Our families were so disappointed that they demanded we give the baby up to somebody*** so that we can focus on our education. ***We didn't and Jakob was about six months old when his dad died*** in a motorcycle crash.\n\nMissed that?", "What\u2019s interesting is that I know the exact post OP was inspired by, and the overwhelming majority said that post\u2019s OP was NTA. Not defending this OP at all but Reddit is strange some times.", ">What should have happened, is that he should have been adopted out to a family she didn\u2019t know.\n\nI agree. I'm also concerned that Great Aunt took him out of duty, so we don't know if he ***ever*** felt he was loved and wanted.", "Yeah and that kid's situation was way more fucked up since his mom said that out of nowhere when he only came to her regarding his mental health. At least this kid has a chance.", "I know this is different, but I always knew my dad had wanted a son. My mom wanted one kid (was a girl) so they had a second because he wanted a son. That\u2019s me, a girl. So not necessarily wanted by either but still treated like a loved child, my sister maintains I was the favorite. \n\nI once overheard my dad telling a friend that he\u2019d always wanted a boy but that he couldn\u2019t imagine life with any other kids once he had us. Wish he\u2019d said it to me/us and earlier in life, though.", "I\u2019m sure the loss of her boyfriend was a major blow to her as well but like damn OP your coming off real cringe. Def softer ways she could have spoken to him.", "Seriously. The kid has ALREADY had an unbelievable amount of loss in his life, and now he has to live with THAT as his mother? I\u2019ll take him \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "this is exactly what I'm thinking. OP fucked up big time, but *this should still be fixable* **if** she comes at it from a perspective of explaining herself *but not* excusing herself. \n\nIt's gonna require a lot from OP, and her son will still never forget those words no matter what she does. But, I think if OP is completely honest, begs for forgiveness and explains herself but doesn't excuse her actions, and makes promises that she upholds.. They can probably move past this. \n\nIt's also not something that will be fixed in one day, though. Op might get his forgiveness at some point, but even if she does, it's a long road to keep it.", "My mom kept telling me she thought of aborting, as if I owe her my life. My mom and dad had to move their wedding up 4 mo, and they had to get married at the Hillel instead of his prestigious school\u2019s chapel. That\u2019s another thing I heard over and over.", "I'm so sorry. I can't imagine having an adoptive parents say that. My biological mother told me around 14 if she could go back in time she would never have kids. When I asked her \"so you wouldn't miss me?\" She responded \"how can I miss you if I never knew you?\" Then I told her the whole point is she DOES know me now and is supposed to love me so much she wouldn't want to go back in time and choose never to have me. She shrugged at me.\n\nMy mom now lives alone and when I do call her during the obligated times (holidays and her birthday) the first thing she does is complain about how her kids never call her or visit her and how unfair it is that even my older siblings call my biological father (they're adoptive father) more than her. We're truly lucky that we have one parent that loves us unconditionally. I feel for the kids who have no second parent to fall back on.", "Toddlers do the same thing but OP skipped that stage.", "Well it\u2019s not like OP made any terrible choices as a teenager!\n\nOH WAIT.", "Oh I was a horrible teenager!

That\u2019s some PETTY shit right there. My dad abandoned me so my mom always made sure I felt loved and supported. AS A MOTHER SHOULD. This woman doesn\u2019t deserve him.

My in-laws are my parents now.\n\nI lived in my car after highschool for a while because my dad kicked me out. I was expected to go to college and work a full time job simultaneously. Never did get that degree because I had to work constantly to pay for somewhere to live and didn't have anything after that for school.\n\nMy kids college is already funded and they are 3 and 1 month old. If they don't want to go to school, I plan on helping them pursue their passion to the best of my ability.\n\nI made the decision to allow them only minimal contact with him because he's disowned me several times so I won't put my kids through having to ask me why their grandfather doesn't want to see them if they get attached.", "You've been groomed to feel like that.\n\nI went through that until my mother tried to make me leave my wife and kid to be her slave again. It took me until that happened to realise quite how crazy it was.", "You feel guilty because they raised you to feel guilty, that\u2019s all. You have nothing to feel guilty about. (Just because you feel it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a reason. Emotions usually tell you something, but not in this case because of your twisted upbringing.) Let them reap what they sowed. I wrote off both my parents and I don\u2019t feel guilty at all. I\u2019m angry. The only advice I can offer is to feel angry instead of guilty, I guess. Anger can give you the energy and strength to leave them in a senior home and let them figure it out, as you said. And anger is the logical emotion, not guilt. When you feel guilty, remind yourself of what they did to you and get angry about it instead. F*** those people.", "It\u2019s rough. I was an IVF baby, so my mom can\u2019t even claim she didn\u2019t want me. I know she went through a lot to have kids, she wanted it more than anything.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 for as long as I can remember she\u2019s been saying shit like \u201cif I knew having kids was gonna be this hard I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d \n\nHow the fuck are you gonna have kids and then tell your kid that they were what you wanted more than anything in the world, but they\u2019re such a bad kid that they\u2019re making you regret it?\n\n>\t I\u2019m 32 and my mom told me this year she found out she was pregnant with me when she went in for a tubal ligation. \n\nThat seems like information she might as well have kept to herself, ouch", "Aw I'm sorry you were told that. It's definitely not something easy to forget.", "Yeah it shouldn't have been common but it seems like it is.", "Ya no wonder hes acting out, poor kid I feel so bad for him, teenage shit coming up and all this on top!", "But she was starting to like him when he was fun /s.\n\nOp, yta.", "I was a horrible human being as a teenager.  I wouldn't wish me on anyone", "TBF, her saying shit like that didn't mess me up, but I had a good support system. I was very close to my brother growing up, my dad was a workaholic but otherwise a good parent, and I had really good teachers and friends. Me and my siblings turned out fine and I have a much better relationship with  my  mom now as an adult. She just should never have had kids, but you know how it was, back in the 80s it was just not a thing to be a woman and stay single... family and society expected her to get married, quit her job and have kids. She hated it. I'm glad times are different now and people don't bat an eyelash at a single person without kids anymore.", "This is honestly a hard one. Obviously OP should never have said what she said.\n\nBut damn, OP never wanted the kid and she should never have raised a kid she didn\u2019t want, but damn by the time Great Aunt relinquished responsibilities Jakob would have been so screwed in the foster system. \n\nNow you have a woman who lived a more unhappy life being pushed into raising a kid she never wanted, and is going to get a resentful son her hates her out of that, Jakob is going to have so many issues and have a mother who may love him but never wanted him, while his true mother figure (great aunt) he\u2019ll probably lose soon enough. \n\nThe only way anyone wins is if the person who suggests he goes to an elderly woman gets slapped and he goes to a family capable of raising him.", "You couldn't pay me to be a teenager again. But to not have anyone love you, really love you, is devastating.", "In my house, we call them mean-agers.

She knows she's the asshole at this point but she really needs to know this information, if she actually wants to do the right thing she will run to the closest family counselor.", "This, my report cards in primary school would always talk about how quiet I was and Mum would say who is this quiet child your teacher keeps talking about, I don\u2019t know her", "I\u2019ll bet if the mom shared this post with her son, he would actually feel loved.", "Yup teenage years are the worst even with loving supportive parent, million times worse for this boy", "I was a very well behaved child.
