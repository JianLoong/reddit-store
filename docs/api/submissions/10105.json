She also mentionned that he refused to see a therapist.\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve known A for years and I know that when it comes to minor issues she tends to react really badly, but if you need to have a serious conversation and a major issue, she reacts really really well. \n\nThe thing is you have to be like really clear for her to understand that there\u2019s a problem. \n\nSaying \"hey I don\u2019t like  when \u2026\" will probably result in a \"don\u2019t be such a snowflake\" or \"it\u2019s no big deal\" \n\nSo I thought that if she acts that way with her boyfriend too he might not want to talk bcuz he\u2019d assume she\u2019d react badly.\n\nBut as I said for important manners she listens and changes really quickly.\n\n\n\n\nSo I took the initiative and asked him to have his side of the story and HOLY SH*T\n\n[Edit] I guess I worded that badly but I didn\u2019t talk to him about their relationship, that\u2019s the message I sent :   \"Hey I was just wondering how you\u2019re feeling, not about the situation with A, as it\u2019s not my buisness but just you as a Person, since you got removed from the group  I was wondering if you wanted to cut ties with everyone or not. And  I wanted to know how it\u2019s going from your side of things, though if you don\u2019t want to talk about it It\u2019s 100% fine\"  \n\nThen he said he did want to talk abt it so yeh\n\n\nThe problem she mentionned was that he doesn\u2019t want to be in a couple.\n\nTHAT\u2019S IT \n\nShe told him he should see a therapist because he wants to be single. He feels horrible, forces himself to keep the relationship (that\u2019s why he wanted a break and not completely break up) and she just feels like if they talk things out he\u2019ll want to stay.\n\nBut he really likes her he just doesn\u2019t want this kind of relationship and realized it\u2019s not for him.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m aromantic asexual, so to hear that my best friend thinks someone who doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship should seek help is just- awful\n\n\nSo now he accepted to keep the relationship going and A keeps saying that they\u2019ll just talk things out and that he\u2019s just a bit confused. When really she just made him so guilty that he felt he needed to stay.\n\nT clearly said no matter what happens it\u2019s just not for him, he wants to stay in good term with her but for A it\u2019s all or nothing. \n\nit\u2019s the week of birthday of A and  T said he just wants to make her happy, not let her down now and he wants me to make her feel better. \n\nBut honestly? I don\u2019t want to. \n\nHe also doesn\u2019t want her to know that he told me about everything that happened but it\u2019s really hard for me to keep that to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to betray T\u2019s trust and after all it\u2019s not really my business so idk what to do,", "created_utc": 1676552248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113q0gx/wibta_if_i_told_my_best_friend_the_way_she_treats/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However A is vastly more of an asshole.\n\nI think you need to focus on supporting T and encouraging him to do what is right for him, which very much sounds like he needs to stand up to A and break off this relationship. \n\nYou also need to decide if A is someone you want to keep around you as a friend.", "YWNBTA\n\nWhat your friend is doing is essentially emotional manipulation. If anything, she herself needs to go to therapy to deal with the way she disregards others thoughts and feelings. T needs to  take a breath and have a conversation with her and ignore her reaction, that's the only way he's going to get out of it. He needs to put his foot down and say his peace, then walk away. Yes he says he really likes her but at some point he needs to put himself first.\n\nYou need to put yourself first too. You said she acts that way to everyone so I'm guessing it's not just T she's treating that way. You may not have to bring T into your conversation but definitely talk to A about how she reacts to and treats people.", "YTA. Never interfere in another relationship. Both parties will end up resenting you for it. It's up to T to end the relationship as an adult. If he can't or won't, you cannot do it for him.", "YWBTA for betraying his confidence when he asked you not to. \n\nBut that\u2019s the only reason. She\u2019s being abusive. Mind your own business is not an answer when there is an abusive relationship.\n\nHer advice that he see a counselor is right for the wrong reasons though. Encourage him to see a counselor to help him get out of a relationship he clearly does not want to be in.", "YTA, \"Best friend\" ??\nYeah no, her best friend wouldn't completely fuck her over and go behind her back trying to sabotage her relationship because of claims that they had no context for. \nStop forcing yourself into their relationship and using the excuse that \"oMg bUt iM aRoAcE\" because so am i, and trust me, seeking therapy is a completely valid thing to do if someones mental health is affecting their relationship.\nA straight person falling out-of-love because of personal issues and someone aroace are NOT the same.", "INFO: \n\nSo you\u2019re all very young. And I think you\u2019re all partially in the wrong.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with T**\n\nIt\u2019s totally valid to not want a relationship. But where it becomes a little bit more convoluted is that it\u2019s not really fair to A if T wants all the emotional intimacy of a relationship (and it sounds like he does, you say he says he likes her a lot and presumably wants her around in a romantic/sexual context, he just doesn\u2019t want to commit to a relationship) but doesn\u2019t want to call it a relationship. \n\nThat does sound like confusion and intimacy issues and something he should seek help for. He can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too. If he doesn\u2019t want a relationship, he can\u2019t just keep her on his hook as a pseudo partner without giving her the respect of partnership. \n\n**Now about A**\n\nIt\u2019s really unclear from your description what the conversations have been between T and A. If T is very clearly telling A that he doesn\u2019t want to see her anymore (not just that he doesn\u2019t want a committed relationship, but that he does not want to see her anymore) and she\u2019s giving him pushback on it, then she\u2019s an AH. You can\u2019t force someone to stay with you. But if he\u2019s telling her he doesn\u2019t want to commit but still wants her in his life, it\u2019s reasonable for her to set a boundary that she isn\u2019t going to do that.\n\n**And lastly, you**\n\nWhy did you insert yourself in this? This was none of your business and it seems like you projected a ton of your own life - your sexual/romantic identity, your personal issues with A, etc into their relationship. Butt out.", "Technically YTA, because he told you in confidence, and breaking his trust like that wouldn\u2019t be okay. It\u2019s not your story to tell. I do understand you being upset on his behalf, but taking matters into your own hands would likely just escalate things.\n\nMaybe instead just start to quietly disengage with A and support T through this awful time.", "YTA\n\nYou overstepped to say the least. Either forget what you heard from the \"boyfriend\" or keep it in mind for when they \"really\" break up and your friend falls apart, your choice. But either way, stay in your lane and mind your own damn business in future. Cheezus.", "NTA cause really wtf. This is bad for T but also does A really want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to be with her? Clearly this is just going to end badly whether it's now or later.\n\nBut think clearly about what you are going to do. Coming to your friend, telling her you went behind her back and then confronting her might end your friendship. As shitty as she's being, it might not really be your place to butt in.", "YWBTA. Stay out of this couple\u2019s relationship. You are already an AH for going behind your friend\u2019s back to try to \u201cfix\u201d aka meddle in their relationship. Their problems are their business, not yours. Nothing is stopping T from breaking up with A if that\u2019s what he wants to do.  A will eventually see that she can\u2019t bully people into liking her or wanting to date her, & she was not wrong to suggest T seek therapy although not for the reason she thought. You can decide on your own whether you want to be friends with A, no matter what A & T end up doing.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your business. Butt out.", "ESH. He shouldn't have told you something about your best friend in confidence because I don't know many friends who wouldn't be at least put in an awkward situation by that, but you shouldn't have gone prying. Your friend sucks a lot, because guilting someone into staying in a relationship is wrong on every level.", "NTA, you are clearly friends with both of them and you care for both so this isn\u2019t an issue of minding your own business, you are concerned for the both of them and care for both of them. However I would say that the better option is to ask T if he would feel more comfortable trying to explain the issue to A if someone who has known A for a bit longer is there. I will also say that I\u2019m both aromantic and asexual myself so I understand how the words A used can hurt you, also that I am autistic so my advice with someone being there to help A and T with the conversation might be off. I know that sometimes what I think is completely normal may actually be something most ppl would think of as weird or breaking a social rule so be aware of that.", "You went behind your friends back to speak directly with her (ex?) boyfriend about their issues. Now you want to involve yourself further.\n\nHun, YTA. Mind your business", "YTA. Don't interfere. Going behind your friend's back to talk to her bf is a shitty way to behave. Also interesting that you believe his side 100%. \n\nIf T doesn't want a relationship, he can use his words. A sounds problematic, but is she really an AH for being all or nothing in this situation?", "YTA. And the boyfriend is an AH too.\n\nIt's probably best to stay directly out of other people's relationships unless you are legitimately concerned for their safety.\n\nThe bf is an asshole because he told his gf he just wants a break, but then told you the relationship wasn't for him no matter what. Then he ultimately ended up staying to avoid being honest. Yes, the truth can hurt, but it seldom hurts worse than being lied to. \n\nSince you have both sides, maybe you should just encourage your friend to move on from the relationship. If he's telling her he's unsure of wanting to be a couple after only a few months together, then their future together isn't looking too bright. She's young and has plenty of time to meet someone she's more compatible with, and honestly she deserves better.", "YWBTA. It is not your relationship. You have not witnessed any of what you\u2019ve been told, and you have no business inserting yourself in their relationship. \n\nThere are 3 sides to the story. His, hers, and the truth, which is usually somewhere between the two. You\u2019re taking what he\u2019s saying at face value, without knowing whether or not he\u2019s telling you everything that actually happened, or just his interpretation of what happened. \n\nYour friend hasn\u2019t asked for advice, he hasn\u2019t asked for advice, stay out of it unless you really don\u2019t want to be friends with A anymore- because that\u2019s where that will wind up.", "Y.T.A for going beyond a typical \"sucks to end a relationship\" talk, reaching out to everyone and now wanting to bail. You acted like you cared, but when things got real you ran off.\n\nThat said, don't interfere with their relationship. Offer support if comfortable, but it's not a situation requiring intervention. They need to sort it out themselves \n\nBut generally NTA. Since you've done nothing really wrong, perhaps misguided. The real judgment will be for your future actions. What now?\n\nAnd, if you are hurt because of the comment:\n\n>I\u2019m aromantic asexual, so to hear that my best friend thinks someone who doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship should seek help is just- awful\n\nThen you should talk with her. Not to \"defend\" ex. But to stand your ground.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re getting involved in someone\u2019s relationship. You should never do that. You\u2019re trusting T in this story but how do you know he\u2019s not manipulating you? He might be saying this stuff to you because he knows you\u2019re asexual and it\u2019ll put you on his side. The fact that he\u2019s sharing but saying don\u2019t tell A is very fishy to me.\n\nAlso it\u2019s not like A can force him to date her. So if he really wanted to leave her, he can. There\u2019s literally nothing stopping him. So something isn\u2019t adding up here. I think T is being deceitful and saying don\u2019t tell A so you can\u2019t check if his story is correct or not.\n\nStay out.
