For the first 6 years of our relationship his aunts have excluded me from any holidays or family gatherings because it was \u201cfamily only\u201d It didn\u2019t feel great but I accepted it. I figured they were just really tight knit I didn\u2019t assume it had to do with my race until after we got engaged I was invited to my first Easter and brought Spanish pastries they seemed very uncomfortable by. Then during the wedding planning the side eyes and comments began. Everything I did was wrong and offensive and not \u201chow they would\u2019ve done it\u201d. Then they called my bridal shower tacky despite the fact we kept it very traditional and it was at a family members beautiful house on my husbands side. Not to mention they showed up upset, severely underdressed and refused to talk to anyone. They also gave my husband a check that he was instructed to specifically not to spend on me as if I was draining him financially even go as far to insinuate he was supporting my mom as well. At the time we made similar salaries and just moved in with my mom to save money as she did not charge us rent. After a few more incidents and micro aggressions I stopped being concerned with how they viewed me and with my baby shower coming up I didn\u2019t want to be worried that they were uncomfortable. It was full of people and music and alcohol(not for me). Baby showers are usually a big Caribbean celebration and we all agreed they would\u2019ve hated it but my husband was still on the fence of extending an invite. I told him it was his decision but I was honest and said I personally wasn\u2019t interested in having them around knowing they aren\u2019t interested in being around me. A few days later he got a message from one of them saying they were hurt they weren\u2019t invited and they had a a pretty good constructive talk but it\u2019s made me feel guilty for assuming they wouldn\u2019t want to come or at least giving them the option.

Those ladies can kick rocks. \n\nWhat I AM wondering is why husband let it go on this long in the first place. The entire in-law side, actually, is getting my side-eye.", "No, you're not wrong. As a mommy myself, you don't need the negative energy and stress around your baby. Believe it or not, babies feel what mommy is feeling. If they already know they are negative people, then they should understand your thoughts. Also, your husband's side of the family sound like a bunch of manipulating narcissists. You definitely don't need that foolishness. Don't feel bad. People don't realize that you get back what you give.\n\nCongrats on your little munchkin. \ud83e\udd70", "NTA\n\nI think you can't win with some people, and these aunts are definitely those \"some people.\" I would tell your husband he needs to handle his family, and talk about boundaries.", "NTA. Why should you invite people who obviously dislike you to your baby shower? They can start being kinder to you if they want to be invited to celebrations that you throw.", "NTA. If they don't respect you as family, why should you consider them as such? I think you'd be justified in telling them you won't let them spend time with your child(ren) unsupervised as they may well take their racism out on the next generation too.", "NTA. Congratulations on the baby! Sounds like the shower was awesome. You are not responsible for their feelings. They\u2019ve acted poorly towards you. You don\u2019t need that negativity in your life right now.", "NTA\nIf there was a good constructive talk, it wouldn't have happened without you not inviting them. Maybe now things can move forward.", "Don't doubt yrself! NTA!", "NTA.  Your husbands aunts have been unsupportive of you in the past at best and didn't earn the privilege to celebrate your pregnancy.  They uninvited themselves by their previous actions.  I do hope the recent conversation was indeed constructive but it's time for the aunts to put action in place, words mean nothing.  Do not let the aunts anywhere near you or the baby when born until real change, contrition, and time occurs.", "NTA all the evidence pointed to the fact that they probably would not want to come and even if they did would make at least one horrible or racist comment. You're better off not interacting with these people", "NTA.  I\u2019m a fan of being direct though, and you should probably hash this out personally with them to determine whether or not they should even have a place in the child\u2019s life if they can\u2019t stand Spanish people", "NTA. They owe you a lot of apologies and need to get their heads out of their rear ends if they want to be involved in your life", "NTA\n\nThey are saying they're hurt to stir up drama since they didn't get to do it at your party.\n\nI'm seriously side eyeing your husband for allowing this crappy behavior from them for so long that they feel entitled to mistreating you.\n\nStop feeling guilty because you didn't want to be around people who have consistently been racist assholes to you and have excluded you.", "NTA! \n\nYou never HAVE to invite anyone to an event to honour you and your baby that doesn\u2019t reciprocate with love. I\u2019d have a few more of those constructive talks with them before they are welcomed back\u2026 they were real awful for real long. \n\nCongrats!!", "NTA - I wouldn't have invited them to continue breathing after the way they behaved.  If they actually want to be civilized and have some sort of relationship now, let them prove it by their actions and maybe they can be invited to the christening party or whatever celebration  you decide to have after your baby is born.  Best of good wishes for the welldoing of your pregnancy and delivery.", "NTA.

You have every right to not want your abusers around you. Especially when you\u2019re pregnant and vulnerable. \n\nFurthermore, of course they wanted to come. No one wants to be the excluded family members, whether they deserve it or not. You\u2019re exclusion made them feel like fools. Which they are. \n\nOn top of that, they would have wanted to be there because they get great joy out of bad mouthing you, criticizing your choices, and being on power trips. Most likely they would have criticized the alcohol at the shower and then handed your husband another check that was \u201cfor him and the baby only\u201d and made more snide comments excluding you and criticizing you. \n\nThere was no reason to invite them and they\u2019re suffering the consequences of their actions and poor behavior. Hopefully this \u201cgood, constructive talk\u201d will help them realize the error of their ways, and they will recognize that your husband and you will not tolerate their abuse, but I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath.

I would just suggest that you stop trying to frame things as \"we all agreed they would\u2019ve hated it\" because whether or not they would have hated the crowded party isn't relevant; they consistently have treated you poorly and that's why they aren't invited, and it's totally OK to make that decision.", "NTA. For family only? Not the way they would have done it? And Spanish pastries make them uncomfortable? Jeez. What a toxic bunch of racists.\n\nYour husband, on the other hand, has at least allowed them to get away with this crap without acting on your behalf, and still wants you to do so.", "NTA I had a drama filled childhood that was very stressful and anxious with a lot of toxic relatives, so I vowed the moment I was out from under my parent's roof, no drama llamas in my life. Try to cut out the toxic if you possibly can, especially racial bigots who trash talk you. They weren't hurt they weren't invited, they were hurt they didn't get an opportunity to have a go at you. Caribbean style baby shower with alcohol, wow wish I'd been there. I hope there was dancing and music, it is what I am imagining!", "Nope.  NTA.   They don't get to complain when they would have just showed up and bitched about everything and ruined it for other people.  F--k them.", "Your husband should stop forcing you to be around people who cannot give you the respect you deserve and who are clearly racist asshats.  They don't get to smooth things over with your husband, who they haven't been targeting and mistreating, and you just get to suck it up.  They owe **you** an apology before you even consider inviting them to another event.  NTA", "Not wrong...  They have been disrespectful to you, your family and culture..  Why would this time be any different?  Their behavior towards you, got them uninvited and maybe your husband should call them on it.", "Thank you! my husband has a pretty complicated history with his side. he\u2019s NC and LC with a lot of his family unfortunately so it\u2019s really shitty to feel like he\u2019s running out of family members to trust which is why I\u2019m glad they actually had a good conversation about it so who knows what the future looks like.", "I understand so I did already have the wedding and they did come and they left early. before that I honestly didn\u2019t think it was my place to confront them. Apparently they were also rude to my family at the wedding so I just didn\u2019t want anything to do with them so no I never spoke to them about it. we really didn\u2019t hear from them for over a year until my SIL posted about becoming an auntie and they only said was that she ruined the reveal my husband told them that was a bit rude cus she was just excited and they ghosted him for months until after the baby shower. On my end I took their lack of interest as how they felt.", "I don't mean to be rude, but what planet are you on? Why should she invite people who have been nothing but unwelcoming and rude to her? It's her baby shower. She should be able to have a nice day without worrying about comments and side eyes. You're right it shouldn't have taken 6 years, but that's on hubby, not on OP.  These are the consequences of their actions over the last 6 years.", "My SIL also agrees they are just upset they didn\u2019t get to be there to criticize it. I also learned baby showers are usually very small and only women here. I remember back when we first started dating I brought him to my cousins baby shower and they were very confused why he was invited and I was confused why he wouldn\u2019t be lol.", "Firstly, on review I should have gone ESH. I\u2019m also just saying that the option should have been given as opposed to just not inviting them without them knowing why.\n\nPlanet is Earth btw.", "NTA", "NTA. Of course they want to come - they want to show up and insult you and talk about how tacky everything you do is, and anything that they can't imply is tacky they want to imply that it's overly expensive and you're bilking your husband for money. If they don't add to your peace, don't keep letting them into your life. You're about to have a baby and to find yourself low on sleep and energy, don't let those vipers drain you of anymore peace of mind.", "How dare you not be interested in us - We're not interested in you!\n\nGeez - some people are just exhausting.\n\nNTA", "Yeah although I wouldn\u2019t want to have to kick them out I had assumed they were just kind of strange like I said I accepted it and I would reassure him it was fine to go on without me because I don\u2019t want to cause a rift he eventually he did start to get irritated and stopped going over so that issue faded for a while. During that time there was a few more people in his life that had surprised him with how they felt about him dating outside his race and I think that really shook him. He has a good group of friends now though really supportive guys.", "Sometimes peoples\u2019 hearts and minds can be changed by a loved one. I\u2019ll keep hope alive for your husband that this is one of those occasions. \n\nNTA for not inviting them though. They\u2019d made their opinion of you pretty clear by that point, so you had every right to not invite them and surround yourself with people who love and respect you instead. \n\nAlso, your baby shower sounded awesome, (and that\u2019s coming from an introvert!). So different from the ho-hum showers typical of my culture.", "I know it sucks but it sounds like you both need to go NC with them all. What if your baby takes after you and they start treating the kid like that? Even if your husband finds it difficult he\u2019s a father so needs to put the kid first.", "NTA. You need to set the record straight with your husband and his racist family. \nDo not let them have access to your children.", "You are NTA. These women had always been very rude to you. This is YOUR baby shower. And your husband needed to lay the law down for them a LONG time ago. \n\nA woman's baby shower is about her, and the expected baby. Every baby shower I've ever attended, consisted of the expectant mother, and mostly her female friends. In some cases, sisters, mothers and grandmothers and aunts might also attend.\n\nBut as these women have shown absolutely NO interest in even being courteous with you, and in light of their extremely RUDE behavior at your bridal shower, you were absolutely within your rights to exclude them in the invitations.", "NTA, please for the love of cheese and all good things, stop thinking you have to give people space to hurt you! I\u2019m glad you stood your ground.", "NTA.  They fucked around and found out.  You don't have to hurt yourself in the hope that eventually they'll start being decent humans.  It's good to draw boundaries early and stick to them.  If they want to be a part of your life, the onus is now on them to prove that they're worth having around.", "NTA. They are only upset about not getting an invite because they wanted to see everything and talk trash about it. I bet when the baby is born they will race to see the hair texture and skin color so they can trash talk that too.", "NTA\n\nthe only reason to invite them would be if they had reached out beforehand--unprompted--because they were so ashamed of their behavior and desperate to apologize--and atone.\n\nsomehow I doubt that happened . . .", "NTA but you have a husband problem\u2026 why have you two not gone NC with these aunts? At a minimum, why has your husband not told them their behavior towards you is unacceptable and they will not be invited to future events? Why is your husband \u201con the fence\u201d about inviting them\u2026?!?!?  That should be a hard NO.", "NTA but you need to make your husband put his foot firmly down on the racism. You two are about to have a child and if you think that racism won\u2019t extend to that child you are mistaken", "NTA. They are fucking racist. I would not interact with them at all. I kind of think your husband is an asshole for hiding how racist his family is.", "NTA.  These people wouldn\u2019t be happy either way.  If they had come they would likely have found fault with everything and made snide remarks, but in not being invited they are pissed because they missed an opportunity to find fault with everything and make snide remarks.  Sometimes you are damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t.  You just can\u2019t win.  On the basis of their past treatment of you you have every right to not invite them to your party.  I hope your husband has explained how much their treatment of you hurt you, and only when you are ready can a rapprochement be attempted.", "NTA\n\nIf they wanted to come to the baby shower they should have been nicer to you from the start. Simple (congrats btw)\n\nPregnancy is hard enough without dealing with family drama.  Let them stew and all the best to you and your little one", "Absolutely. NTA. Your response to their appalling bad manners is entirely appropriate.", "Oh I whole heartedly believe that his side of the family is waiting to see who the baby resembles before reaching out since no one has asked us anything my entire pregnancy except that one comment about the baby shower. we definitely will not be sending baby pics to his side.", "Well ultimately I\u2019m glad he started dealing with it in the end and I\u2019m sorry that he had a fair few who felt that way. I\u2019m happy that things have moved on in regards to his friends."]}
