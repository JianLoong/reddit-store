I\u2019m a massive fan. When the release date was revealed I immediately requested PTO for that date as I plan on staying home that day and enjoying the new game. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the day I asked off for is the Friday before Mothers day.  \nMy company has had to limit the requests off for that date now as many people have been asking off for it. I had previously told some of my co workers I was planning on staying home to play the game, and I guess word got around because one of my other coworkers asked me after work to give her my PTO so she can travel for mother\u2019s day. I explained to her that i requested this day off months ago for a specific reason and I really wasn\u2019t willing to change it. She got pretty upset with me claiming I care more about videogames than family and whatnot. I honestly don\u2019t really care about her not being able to travel because I feel like if this was an important date then you would have requested off early, like I did.

If there's a real emergency, that's a different story.", "Right?? OP planned ahead, coworker didn't and lost out. Tough. \n\nNTA.", "or the equally valid op cares about the video game more than the co-worker\u2019s family to whom op has no emotional connection to or responsibility towards", "or the equally valid op cares about the video game more than the co-worker\u2019s family to whom op has no emotional connection to or responsibility towards", "If the PTO was so crucial, the coworker could've requested the date months ago like OP did.\n\nNTA", "OP wouldn't be here if coworker had just asked, accepted no for an answer, and went about her day.  However, coworker is now badmouthing OP to colleagues, and siccing them on OP trying to lay a guilt trip.  That is way out of line and it absolutely makes coworker the asshole.", "Why technically? Cause video games?", "It\u2019s not about the game being there later to play. It\u2019s that I have waited for over 5 years to play this specific game. I\u2019m gonna play it as soon as I can. And as for my co workers, this is a job with no career growth- so no, I don\u2019t really care about their goodwill or whatever.", "Oh, noes.  The manipulation in all its glory.", "Well now I gotta know how this story ends. How did they react? What ended up happening?", "Against a family that means nothing to him? Why are their lives more important?", "Hell no, you're NTA.", "This is a Bot. Partial comment stolen from @illustrious_legs_2537. I hope I copied the OP right but I can't figure out how to copy and paste via mobile", "Whoa, there. You're being all logical and planning ahead. /s", "I usually keep my private life private and don\u2019t talk about it with my coworkers. So any time I get shit like that I just reply \u201cwho says I don\u2019t have kids?\u201d and then never elaborate.", "I DO have kids and I would never try to guilt someone to let me have their day off.  Kids don't care what day it is, really, there's much bigger things in life to get all worked up about! I say if someone wants a day off to sleep all day and lounge in PJs, they should do it and not feel a single drop of guilt", "This just seems entirely unfair. (I\u2019m not directing this at you specifically, you didn\u2019t write the policy after all.) But If you\u2019re in a field that works holidays, everyone should have a place in the rotation. \n\nHow do you define \u201cfolks without family?\u201d I don\u2019t have kids, but my family (parents,aunts,uncles, sister) always do a huge get together for major holidays. To miss that because someone defines \u201chaving a family\u201d as \u201chaving birthed a child\u201d is just bull shit. \n\nI\u2019m currently single and have no children,  I would much rather work New Years than Christmas. \n\nI\u2019ll suck it up and take my place in the rotation if everyone takes a turn, but I refuse to pretend like someone else deserves a holiday off more than I do. If we work the same job, then we both have to deal with the crappy part.", "Just because I don't have kids doesn't mean I don't have a family", "This would have pissed me off. I may not have a family, but I celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday and am in church. They tried that with me at a previous place of employment, and it was quickly rescinded. (On the other hand, I did cover thanksgiving every year, and new years if needed, as well as all the summer holidays. I just needed Christmas and Easter off)", "Did it work out well or did all the people who hated it feel like they had to keep their resentment silent?", "if they dont value my reasons for taking time off, i shouldnt have to value theirs. And, its not ops fault the coworker doesnt like their mother enough to request the time off with enough time lol", "Yes, but it's the same specific Sunday every year. \n\nI'm in New Zealand - Mothers Day is 2nd Sunday in May, Father's Day is 1st Sunday in September - easy to plan for, just look at a calendar to get the actual date.", "But always the second Sunday in May.", "\"My mother has just been hospitalized with terminal butthole cancer...\"  \n\"Shoulda requested leave four months ago like I did.\"  \nIt doesn't take much imagination to think of a hundred valid reasons why you might want to request last-minute leave. Timing is not necessarily indicative of importance.", "Thankyou, edited my response as I did not properly read the last couple lines.", "Because they aren\u2019t an AH for saying no in my opinion, but they could be more flexible if they wanted to be a nice person.", "I got xmas off and they didn't, that was pretty much it, haha", "This is the way.", "Yeah.  Same. I worked at a place that you had to work holidays so there was a sign up sheet that was first come first serve, and everyone signed up for a holiday to work for on the big four of us, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve and New Years Day. We had to sign up for two for a guaranteed one off and pick either the morning shift or  afternoon/evening shift. So I usually chose Thanksgiving morning, food's not ready until after I'd be out anyway, and then New Years Day morning because I'm not a huge New Years Eve person anyway and figured that's one spot for the people who do drink that can take the day off. Of all the jobs I had where holiday work was mandatory, that one was the fairest I thought.", "I had a job try to pull that with me about a day off and he said his family was more important than mine...two weeks after my little brother died.", "I don\u2019t give a shit if you don\u2019t value their reasons for taking time off. Nobody is saying OP should give up his time. Can you indicate where I implied otherwise? I\u2019n not seeing it. Your suggested response to them is unprofessional and childish.", "Because a sudden hospitalization is exactly the same as a holiday that happens literally every year, that everyone knows is coming", "that\u2019s not a valid comparison as there\u2019s no indication that this coworker suddenly needed the time due to any reason like that rather than it just being for the holiday\u2014which frankly can be found on calendars way in advance", "Sometimes it's easy to read these storys as soap operas and forget \"Wait, if they did the most savage thing possible it might just have comsequences\""]}
