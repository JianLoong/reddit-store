What I didn\u2019t realize was that the day I asked off for is the Friday before Mothers day.  \nMy company has had to limit the requests off for that date now as many people have been asking off for it. I had previously told some of my co workers I was planning on staying home to play the game, and I guess word got around because one of my other coworkers asked me after work to give her my PTO so she can travel for mother\u2019s day.

The coworker got pissed bc she didn\u2019t plan well and was missing her kids recital. Like please \ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc everyone needs to get off their high horses. \n\nEnjoy Zelda!!!!! NTA", "NTA but I personally think telling people why / being honest about why he was taking that day off was pretty naive. Obviously people were going to react this way. I guess my advice would be: In the future remember that a lot of people will not understand that what you\u2019re doing with your time is none of their business and it\u2019s not your responsibility to give that up for them - they will just see what you\u2019re doing *vs* what someone else wants to be doing, and judge who deserves that time accordingly - in the court of public opinion etc. \n\nJust lie.", "If anything, your coworker should be ashamed that you care more about your video games than she does about her family.\n\nYou planned ahead. You enjoy it however you want for whatever reason.", "Talk to HR about this person and the collective harassment she incited as well- this is messed up", "I think the OP is NTA and should take his day off, but I don\u2019t think that is the same as saying he cares more about his video games than that woman\u2019s family. If it were an actual emergency where the woman needed help to care for her family, then I would hope OP would postpone his video game playing to help her out.\n\nThis is not that situation, though. She can still see her family without needing to travel on that Friday. Mother\u2019s Day is a nothing holiday, and she can visit her family any other time.", "Tbh I hate taking my parents out on the appropriate parent day because everything is crowded, overpriced, and rushed. I always take them out on a day before or after.", "Yeah, like maybe I'm just a terrible daughter, but out of all the holidays we have, I'd never fly home for Mother's Day?? I'd assume that OP's coworker is also far enough to need to fly if they were asking for the Friday off. Like I can travel home and tell my mom she's awesome on literally any other weekend, without having to buy a themed Hallmark card.", "It's absolutely no one's business why you have the day off.\n\nMother's Day is Sunday. She can travel Saturday and still be there.\n\nYou asked first. \n\nNTA.", "> date then you would have requested off early, like I did. Anyways I firmly told her no, but she told some of my other co workers and they are pissed at me and calling me an A hole for not giving up the date. AITA? edited typos\n\nAs a mother to an adult child I feel like my daughter who has no children should still be given a day off to hang out with her family who loves her dearly!  I also worked a job in animal care that required coverage every day to include holidays, many of my coworkers didn't have children, what we always did was rotate holidays to make it fair, we felt it made for better working relationships in fact we all still hang out with each other 14 years after the fact.. My former coworkers are actually better aunts and uncles than my daughters actual biological aunts and uncles lol", "I am empathetic to how hard it is to be a working parent, so I have stepped up numerous times to help out. But I hate when child-free people are expected to put themselves second to those with children.", "It sounds like OP cared more about this video game than their coworker cared about their own mother lol", "I don\u2019t think it is even fair to classify this as OP caring MORE about his own happiness, this is OP caring equally about their happiness. They both deserve happiness and the opportunity to take days off, and clearly not everyone can take the same day off, so the fair way is first come first serve. If the other lady had planned her day first, OP wouldn\u2019t have tried to get he to switch, because he DOESN\u2019T care more about his own happiness\u2026he cares equally.", "Also wouldn't it make more sense to take the Monday after mother's day off so she won't have to travel that day home to make it to work the next day, also there no reason she can't just leave after work Friday.", "I take vacation days whenever a game I really want to play comes out. I used to work for a company just like yours. Got criticizes to fucking hell for daring to take days off and take people away from their families >.> \n\nNow I'm at a much better company. I can be honest about why I took the days off and when I come back, some of the team is actually interested on how my vacay went.", "Considering the company had to implement a limit due to the number of people requesting off, how many other co-workers requested it off, got turned down, accepted it, and made alternative plans with their mother or their kids? It doesn't sit well with me that she's requesting the time off so close to the event and feels like she can \"jump the line\" of people that had previously requested it by guilt-tripping OP.\n\nIf something is important to you, you plan ahead. I want to take the day off to see the total solar eclipse next year. Do you want to guess the first thing I'm going to do when I get to back to work January 2, 2024 will be?", "This is the best response I've seen so far.", "It actually does constitute a problem for OP, given that OP will face social consequences at work and be a bit of a pariah for awhile since everyone there seems aligned that this isn't cool.", "It\u2019s his business so he can tell whoever he wants.", "Also, they can celebrate the weekend after? Like I don't get why people kick up such a fuss over not being able to celebrate the day of. If you're an adult with other adult friends, good luck trying to plan get togethers and celebrations on that one specific day itself.\n\nFor example, my family celebrated Christmas a week early last year. Because the weekend itself some of my siblings had other plans. It didn't diminish the mood of the occasion. We still got to spend time together as a family, had a great meal, exchanged presents, it was Christmas in everything but the day itself and we honestly didn't care.", "Lmao her problem is not his problem. She should have take the day off in advance like he did. You\u2019re asking him to give up time off that he earned? Entitled AH", "Lol so OP should alter his life because his coworkers feel entitled to his time off? Lol not everyone lives according to others. NTA at all OP", "It\u2019s his PTO that he EARNED. She should have planned better.  Those coworkers and you are an entitled AH for thinking like this", "Messed up? It\u2019s his PTO that he EARNED. it\u2019s his right to not only take that day off, but also brag as much as he wants that it\u2019s to play a video game.", "A coworker who expects you to prioritize their family will rarely return the consideration that they request.", "The good will of co-workers is overvalued. The only good will that matters at work are those that will continue to employ you.\n\nAnd shockingly, I would fully expect my co-worker to do the same.", "Considering OP is responsible enough to request PTO ahead of time, they\u2019d never be in this position so the shoe would never be on their foot", "If this day is so hot, why doesn't the workplace plan better and line up some temps or something? Why have a war over certain days off?", "...As someone who also got the day off to play Tears of the Kingdom, I didn't realize it was time for Mother's Day until I read this post. Now I gotta scramble to get stuff for my mom, grandmothers and godmother.", "Same. I already booked off in June to play Final Fantasy 16. I've been waiting for this game since the first trailer was released two years ago. If someone were to tell me to cancel my leave, I would have told them to go pound sand.\n\n\"It's just a video game\". Like do people not understand that video games are a hobby just like anything else? Like it's no different to looking forward to that concert you finally got tickets for, or that movie or tv series you really want to watch, or even that new book in a series you've been waiting 5 years for.\n\nAnd yeah, anyone with internet can simply go google the dates of important holidays for that year and planned ahead. Like I've taken long weekends before when I see bank holidays on like a Thursday. Just book the Friday off and woo hoo! 4 day weekend! People not being able to plan in advance is not my problem.", "THIS for petes sake OP. What shes doing is not okay, and you know she go to HR for less", "Right? Just send flowers and plan for a phone call.", "Agree. Most people don\u2019t ask but occasionally someone will say \u201cdoing something fun?\u201d  I usually say  \u201cMaybe if there\u2019s time,\u201d implying that something more serious is happening. I\u2019ve never had anyone push for more after that, however someone did push a co worker about what he was doing and after deflecting a few times he said \u201chemorrhoid surgery!\u201d In an angry voice. The whole office was quiet for the rest of the morning.", "In the short term, yes. In the mid-term, it's OP's problem, bc he just made all his coworkers mad going by the post. Nobody is going to lift a finger to help him out in the future, and not just around PTO.\n\nThere's a lot of folks trying to stand on principle in the responses, but like, that's just not how workplace dynamics go.", "FYI - I'm a nearly 40 year old mom and I have also had PTO booked for TOTK's release day so I can play while the kids are in school. Our calendar has been circled since the day it was announced. I literally had no idea it was also Mother's Day weekend until I read this post, sadly not exaggerating. I guess now I have an excuse for pulling several all nighters playing Zelda with the kids all weekend.  :)", "Sorry you don\u2019t know how the real world works. Better luck next time.", "They don't need it for travel.\nThey want it.\n\nIt's not a family emergency or anything like that.", "Every now and again this subreddit gets one of these threads when the commentariat gets stuck on the idea that \"I have the right to be as big an asshole as I want\" and forgets the purpose of the subreddit.", "I took the day off too! I'm a little disgruntled that my play time will be interrupted by family festivities that weekend lol. I suppose I will need a break!", "After over a year working together, one of my coworkers finally found out I am 10 years older than she assumed based on my appearance.\n\nI keep work and private life on deep lockdown.  I don\u2019t advertise anything, and I avoid personal conversations. I am here to work, browse Reddit, pretend to work, and collect a paycheck.", "I use that method myself as well. I have a baby face and despit ebeing 28 years old, my coworkers (mostly women in their 40s) like to pick on me for it. Making anide remarks and belittling me because of my age.

No employer in the US can make you work on a religious holiday if you\u2019re religious.", " she didn\u2019t know when it was going to happen.", "OP made no secret of what the time off was for, and no one seemed upset until this particular coworker went around stirring up shit because OP wont give up thier day off. OP could probably give Coworker all the days off she could ever want by going to HR about Coworker creating a hostile work environment.", "It's called being a decent human being. Travel is something that has little flexibility. Playing a video game, no matter how excited you are, is something that has literally infinite flexibility.", "She can care about her family all she wants, and probably does. It doesn't mean that OP needs to care about that family more than she does her own time. Single childless people are entitled the same time off, and this was literally dibs.

I would sometimes swap hospital shifts with coworkers because their kids had recitals or whatnot, but then it became an ongoing thing to ask me to swap every holiday because of \"the kids.\" My time is not worth any less just because I didn't spawn.", "My dad's birthday is that weekend, too. But he'd understand -- he took off for Ocarina of Time when it dropped.", "We also have that guy.  His reasoning is the same, although he doesn't call off sick.  He just likes to take a Wednesday off.  I love it though, We work in a department of 6 and we can't have too many people off at once.

I even tried to be a good person and accomodate to others sometimes on those long holiday weeks. But then, when it was my turn, no one wanted to help me.\n\nSo f*ck them all. If I can and want to take a free day next to a holiday even when I'm gonna just stay home, I will do it.\n\nMost of the times, if asked, I will say I already have plans.

He's technically in the right to not give up his PTO. But he's absolutely an asshole. There are very few reasons why I would keep a PTO day over a colleague who needs it for travel.
