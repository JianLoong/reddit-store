Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.\n\nRecently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. \n\nDuring the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got \"mom privileges\" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other \"mom things\" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). \n\nShe asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. \n\nShe said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the \"you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it\" card. \n\nI heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't \"get it\" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

So I started meeting her only after she arrived.", "NTA\n\nYou can't imagine that a friend would make a big public stink about something unless she was righteously upset, but it happens all the time (with some people).\n\n1. Being quite late rarely (and with a phone call to update you) or being 5-10 minutes late happens. Being late by more than 30-60 minutes consistently is PLANNED disrespect of your time. \\[Could she be late on purpose because she resents you expecting her to meet you half-way?\\]\n2. Telling you that you don't get it because you don't have children is ARROGANCE on her part. Clearly, you have other friends with kids who apparently get something that this friend doesn't get - how to manage their time and respect others' schedules and plans.\n3. Making a public stink - that's not because she has a right to be upset. That's because she wants to rally people to believe that you are just a mean bully for expecting some basic, common decency from her. She is trying to create or find her FLYING MONKEYS (people who will support her in making you think you are the 'bad guy').\n\nBased on all that, I'm not sure you really want to continue a friendship with her. If you are not quite ready to give up on her, may I suggest a few new steps (some more genuine, some a bit sarcastic):\n\n1. Tell her to give you a call when she is on her way to meet you. Then you will leave your home and meet her at the restaurant. (What will she claim made her late if she's already got her FOUR-YO daughter in her carseat?)\n2. Consider planning to arrive about 35-45 minutes later than scheduled. It would be very interesting to see what happens next. Does your friend continue to consistently arrive after your? When she realizes that you are planning to arrive later than scheduled, does she arrive even later? Does she get mad that you aren't committing to arrive on time even though she never has?\n3. Tell her that you are SOOO sorry to hear she just struggles with being on time for anything (because she can't have trouble with this ONLY when she's visiting with you). You have tons of friends with children who don't have trouble with this and would be happy to have them help her learn how to overcome her challenges with this. You have told them all about how she just isn't capable of being on time, no matter how hard she tries, and they are just chock full of pro-parent tips that she must just not have learned in the past four years. \\[OK, there's a lot of sarcasm here.\\]\n4. Tell her, you'll be happy to meet her at your home. You can agree that one time she and her child come to see you at your home, and the next time you will visit her at her home. On her visits to you, she can still call you when she's leaving so you'll know to expect her about 45 minutes later.\n5. If those options don't work, tell her to let you know when being at least close to on-time is not such a challenge for her. In the meantime, you'll be happy to catch up with her over the phone.

I've never been late to anything, even if I have to wrangle 3 kids alone. Your friend needs to do better", "NTA. Plenty of parents manage time OK. A few minutes here and there, yes, can he attributed to kids, but consistently being a half hour late and then an hour - that\u2019s not on the child unless something major happened. It also doesn\u2019t mean you have to be OK with it.  \n\nCurious to know - how were things before Katie? Is your friend dealing with anything, like untreated PPD?", "So she didnt even leave the house until 30 mins past you meet up time. It is beyond rude.  She knew 30 mins before the meetup time was not going to make it. You TEXT and let know running late. She could gad respected you by giving heads up esp early so you stay home and wait to leave when she leaves.  Im guessing she was like this pre kids. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe knows she has to wrangle her daughter. She knows she has to do these other mysterious \u2018mom things\u2019.\n\nSometimes things are going to come up. Of course they are.

They\u2019re 5,3,&2 and I\u2019m also a stay at home mom. I think I\u2019ve been late less than 5 times for something. I\u2019m always early for everything. I\u2019m the youngest of 8 and we were always late for everything, not because of how many kids there are but my mom especially is late always for stuff besides appointments.", "NTA. This is definitely an issue with Samantha's time management.\n\nLet's lay this out. She showed up over an hour late, including a 25-minute drive. Since the actual timing isn't disclosed, I'm going to run with 60 minutes late because that's the minimum. 60 minutes late - 25 minute drive = she left the house 35 minutes AFTER MEETING TIME. Minimum. That's way outside the realm of \"mom privilege.\"\n\nSo she, knowing what time she needed to be there and how long she needed to drive, decided not to leave the house until over half an hour after the appointed time? How long does it take to wrangle her generally-well-behaved toddler? She knew it's about a half hour drive, the car should be leaving the driveway a little earlier than that. She should be working backwards from there and leaving herself extra room for common complications like a change or the kid mushing blueberries all over her clothes. Instead she seems to start getting ready when she should already be there.\n\nIf you really value this friendship, then in future you may need to adopt a broken stair solution where you give her times an hour early to account for her chronic lateness. But really, it's your call.", "NTA... Drop the so-called friend.  You don't need that in your life.", "NTA. Parents do have to be on time every now and again. And IF something comes up (it happens!), there's always the option of texting the other person in time to let them know. Once she realized she would be more than an hour late, she could have told you and you'd just have left home an hour later. (I wouldn't be so harsh if it was an occasional incident, but being late every damn time is not normal, not even for parents.)", "The thing is, it's not like she had a newborn that she has to swaddle and treat like fragile crystal, she has a 4-year-old.

I am a mom of two and have a gazillion alarms set on my phone to keep us all on track.", "NTA- Mom of two here and anything beyond 5-10 minutes late because someone suddenly can\u2019t locate their favorite stuffy that HAS to go for the car ride is unacceptable. And when that happens, I always text to tell the friend I\u2019m late and apologize. She\u2019s wasting your time and pretty much saying you can wait around because you don\u2019t have children.

Last time I was 10 minutes late because he had peed on the floor and smeared takoyaki sauce on the curtains RIGHT before the babysitter came. I hastily cleaned it up then ran to catch my train, I profusely apologized because even though I\u2019m a mom, it doesn\u2019t entitle me to others waiting for me. I can only hope they understand that I am really doing my best. Being over 30 minutes late is a lot. Even though I can\u2019t judge what happened, that seems due to a lack of planning if it happened repeatedly.", "NTA. You are absolutely right. Your time is just as valuable as hers.

How would this child ever get to school or a doctor's appointment if her mom can't leave the house on time?", "NTA.  Was she incapable of calling you to let you know she was running late, and offer to reschedule?  I have acquaintances who are late quite often.  If they want to meet for lunch, they have 2 chances to be there within 15 minutes of the designated time.  After that I won't meet them for lunch.", "NTA. She's just rude and doesn't value your time.

With that said, I know I have to start getting ready with them at least 1 hour before we have to go anywhere so I do t make plans for anything before 12. I think your friend is taking advantage of the mom card and not managing her time well, which I learned to do over time and she can too. \n\nIf you want this friendship to work, she needs to meet you halfway both in meeting place and in her behavior.

Moms blaming their kids for being late was a pet peeve of mine when I was childless. I had my first at 38. We\u2019ve only been late once in 14 months and it was by 5 minutes.

And guess what, I was very rarely late for work\n2) Over an hour late with no notification is incredibly rude. \n3) She is treating you with contempt. Is the concept of giving herself enough time to deal with her child and get to you on time too difficult for her?\n\nFind better friends.", "NTA, it takes less than 10 seconds to send a text that you\u2019ll be late.

She is in the wrong for being late, for sure. With kids, you plan in time for getting on shoes, time to get them into the car, etc. But- you could have texted and said you were leaving because she was so late.

This friendship seems more aggravating than anything at this point.", "NTA.  Your friend needs to drop the sancti\"mom\"ious attitude and get over herself.  My sister has 5 kids and one one the way.  If she can be on time, anyone can.", "NTA I can understand being a little late because of a small child. But over an hour late is ridiculous.

She just doesn\u2019t respect you. That\u2019s what it comes down to.", "NTA\n\nSamantha is in for a rude shock once her daughter enters school next year.

Your friend is rude.", "ESH. Your friend is being entitled but your little stunt was petty. If you're leaving, tell her. And you didn't leave. You stayed to see how late she'd be. So you're acting all high and mighty about your time and then wasting it just to see how late your friend is like a private detective for no reason. So if you actually liked your friend, you still could've hung out because you were there. She was clearly struggling with her small child. I'm child free but I try to extend compassion to parents because it's hard. You need to admit that her having a kid and no longer being able to easily meet you out makes you not want to be friends with her anymore. Don't torture her like this when you don't even like her. Yes, she should compromise and be on time but not everyone is good at doing that when they have a kid because it's really hard.", "ESH. If she's constantly 30 min late why do you keep showing up on time? \n\nWhile you're annoyed at her and I get it, it's not your job to teach her lessons.

It's a matter of prioritizing.", "Well, to be fair, with kids it can sometimes be that hard. \n\nDespite a few super mums in these comments, kids, especially young babies, can be unpredictable. \n\nIf once every now and again a mum is late due to tantrum / unplanned projectile vomit clean up etc, then people should be understanding.

Why didn't she call you when she hadn't left yet and was _already late to be there_ and let you know there was a problem.

Kids can make you late (they suddenly need a diaper change, they are having a tantrum, they refuse to get ready/get in the car, they suddenly got hurt/feel sick, etc.), but they shouldn't make you regularly 30-60 minutes late.

After 3 years of fatherhood I can have the car seat strapped up  and my son strapped in in no time. There are days when it is tougher, and we may run a bit late, but not every single time.

I use my time with thoughtfulness and respect due to it being a precious commodity. I would say being a parent makes you even more aware of how fast time goes by and makes the whole \"mom card\" entitlement even bigger BS!

That's not a \"friend\" I would keep in my circle!!", "Yeah, I don't get people like this. I'm chronically late, or at least, I used to be, and I could easily be again. I have ADHD, which comes with the general distraction+ timeblindedness, which makes getting on time anywhere an effort and a pain...but I put that effort in every time because I refuse to be that person who makes everyone wait.\n\nIn fact, some people might perceive me as chronically early, because I'm always at least 15 minutes early, if not more.

I'm so, so tired of the \"there was traffic\" excuse. There is ALWAYS traffic; plan for it!

Being 30 minutes late for an appointment that takes 25 minutes to get there means OP could have done an errand or tossed in a load of laundry before heading to the location.

Blaming being a mother for being a late arriver is poor form. It happens and it happens more often than someone who does not have a child due to needs and wants of a temperamental mini me. \n\nIf the OP is exaggerating how often the friend is late then she is the AH, but if its a more often than not scenario, I'd be livid. If she knows she's going to be late, there's nothing wrong with just letting someone know and, perhaps, aiming to arrive early.", "Are you a single parent?", "This, its incredibly audacious to complain about wasting 25 minutes of her time when for her to be over an hour late, OP has already driven 25 minutes and waited 35 minutes before she's even left and to make no effort to inform OP on top of this\n\nDefinitely NTA", "I definitely agree, I had a friend loke ops who for whatever reason went from being on time to perpetually late from the moment she got pregnant on.

There are a lot of people who stay in relationships (of all kinds) out of a fear that they don\u2019t have a right to stand up for what they need and want, or that what they need and want is unreasonable, and that can tend to multiply unnecessarily the unhappiness in the world.

Either that or grab a coffee and chill the fuck out.", "There's not a good answer to this. It'll vary wildly depending on the personality of the person your friend wants to have that conversation with. Some people can/will appreciate the straight-forward approach. Telling them that you feel like they're not respecting your time, others will not.", "Not who you were replying to, but I\u2019d suggest considering your goals in communicating and letting that drive what you say and how. Venting your disappointment in someone\u2019s choices (say, to blast you on social media) may be appropriate if you are trying to stand up for yourself. Simply fading away with vague failures to ever suggest plans or be available when they are would be better if your goal is to just extricate yourself from the friendship without any further fuss. Having a heart to heart about how you feel (using I-statements) and/or checking in on things that might be underlying the behavior (defensiveness in the face of a sense of losing oneself to motherhood, jealousy over your perceived \u201cfreedom,\u201d mental health struggles and something like unaddressed ADHD) might be worth it if saving the friendship is paramount. And so on and so forth.", "I might just plainly say \u201cHey, I noticed being 30-60 min is the norm for you as you\u2019re in this phase of life. No judgment on my part.

I\u2019ll be at a festival with friends ABC next weekend. Swing by if you\u2019re free!\u201d and just live my life assuming they may not show. \n\nYou can also shift all of your recommendations to what I suggested here without explaining why and see if they accept.
