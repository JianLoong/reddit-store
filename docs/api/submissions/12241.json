Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.\n\nRecently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. \n\nDuring the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got \"mom privileges\" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other \"mom things\" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). \n\nShe asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. \n\nShe said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the \"you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it\" card. \n\nI heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't \"get it\" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

However, she has shown a pattern here of not respecting you or your time because hey, she has a kid and you don't.

So I started meeting her only after she arrived.", "NTA\n\nYou can't imagine that a friend would make a big public stink about something unless she was righteously upset, but it happens all the time (with some people).\n\n1. Being quite late rarely (and with a phone call to update you) or being 5-10 minutes late happens. Being late by more than 30-60 minutes consistently is PLANNED disrespect of your time. \\[Could she be late on purpose because she resents you expecting her to meet you half-way?\\]\n2. Telling you that you don't get it because you don't have children is ARROGANCE on her part. Clearly, you have other friends with kids who apparently get something that this friend doesn't get - how to manage their time and respect others' schedules and plans.\n3. Making a public stink - that's not because she has a right to be upset. That's because she wants to rally people to believe that you are just a mean bully for expecting some basic, common decency from her. She is trying to create or find her FLYING MONKEYS (people who will support her in making you think you are the 'bad guy').\n\nBased on all that, I'm not sure you really want to continue a friendship with her. If you are not quite ready to give up on her, may I suggest a few new steps (some more genuine, some a bit sarcastic):\n\n1. Tell her to give you a call when she is on her way to meet you. Then you will leave your home and meet her at the restaurant. (What will she claim made her late if she's already got her FOUR-YO daughter in her carseat?)\n2. Consider planning to arrive about 35-45 minutes later than scheduled. It would be very interesting to see what happens next. Does your friend continue to consistently arrive after your? When she realizes that you are planning to arrive later than scheduled, does she arrive even later? Does she get mad that you aren't committing to arrive on time even though she never has?\n3. Tell her that you are SOOO sorry to hear she just struggles with being on time for anything (because she can't have trouble with this ONLY when she's visiting with you). You have tons of friends with children who don't have trouble with this and would be happy to have them help her learn how to overcome her challenges with this. You have told them all about how she just isn't capable of being on time, no matter how hard she tries, and they are just chock full of pro-parent tips that she must just not have learned in the past four years. \\[OK, there's a lot of sarcasm here.\\]\n4. Tell her, you'll be happy to meet her at your home. You can agree that one time she and her child come to see you at your home, and the next time you will visit her at her home. On her visits to you, she can still call you when she's leaving so you'll know to expect her about 45 minutes later.\n5. If those options don't work, tell her to let you know when being at least close to on-time is not such a challenge for her. In the meantime, you'll be happy to catch up with her over the phone.
