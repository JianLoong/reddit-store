Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.\n\nRecently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. \n\nDuring the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got \"mom privileges\" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other \"mom things\" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). \n\nShe asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. \n\nShe said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the \"you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it\" card. \n\nI heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't \"get it\" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

If you got kids and wrangling your goblins means a longer prep period, you start earlier.  Kids are no excuse for poor time management.", "NTA\n\nSamantha's sense of entitlement here is mind-boggling!! We get it. She has a kid; you don't. That doesn't automatically grant her an excuse to be late or to be rude to you. \n\nRaising a toddler is no doubt stressful and things don't always go as planned. I get it.  However, she has shown a pattern here of not respecting you or your time because hey, she has a kid and you don't. She could choose to get ready earlier, knowing it's going to take her a while to wrangle her kid. She could also have called you when she was on her way so you know when to expect her. At the VERY least, she could have been just a tiny bit apologetic for Always running late. \n\nShe does none of those things and expects you to be ok with her rude behavior due to her having a kid and you not.

They're unpredictable and will sabotage even the best-laid plans.\n\nAnd when that happens, as a parent, you apologize - and try to keep it from happening. Most of us don't play the victim and make excuses. We even contact whoever's waiting on us and try to give them updates so they know we don't take their time or their patience for granted.\n\nWe certainly don't run around disparaging the person who *wasn't* late in all of our social circles. (Though I wouldn't worry about that - those people will also have discovered she's persistently unreliable and refuses to take responsibility for it.)\n\nIf you'd like to maintain this friendship, you can ask her to lunch another day. She may or may not try to make it your problem, but letting her know that you're leaving after 30 minutes seems more than reasonable. (In this case, that literally means she can leave her house when she's supposed to already be there, and have 5 minutes to spare!)\n\nIt's also possible she's just not able to be a friend to you. Maybe not right now. Maybe ever.\n\nSometimes life just pulls us in different directions.", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if someone is coming to your house, but meeting in public, I think it is reasonable to be up to 10-15 mins late with update texts and apologies informing you on the way.

I'm talking my birthday parties, funerals for our friends, a coffee, anything, her kids always seemed to spontaneously combust right when it was supposed to happen.\n\nI knew she was lying and it was confirmed later as her girls got older and added me on social media. Like the family is out at a bbq or something else two hours after the youngest BROKE THEIR ARM and is in pictures without a cast or sling or anything. Yeah but nah. \n\nSo I cut her off and recently she tried to reconcile with me. She was coming to where I live to \"get away from her kids,\" three of which are grown or close to it, one lives a college now. And we were supposed to get a coffee when I got off work one night.

You are still probably going to be late every once in a while, but at some point it\u2019s a time management issue on your friend\u2019s part since it sounds like their child is past napping phase.
