Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.\n\nRecently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. \n\nDuring the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got \"mom privileges\" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other \"mom things\" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). \n\nShe asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. \n\nShe said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the \"you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it\" card. \n\nI heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't \"get it\" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

So I started meeting her only after she arrived.", "NTA\n\nYou can't imagine that a friend would make a big public stink about something unless she was righteously upset, but it happens all the time (with some people).\n\n1. Being quite late rarely (and with a phone call to update you) or being 5-10 minutes late happens. Being late by more than 30-60 minutes consistently is PLANNED disrespect of your time. \\[Could she be late on purpose because she resents you expecting her to meet you half-way?\\]\n2. Telling you that you don't get it because you don't have children is ARROGANCE on her part. Clearly, you have other friends with kids who apparently get something that this friend doesn't get - how to manage their time and respect others' schedules and plans.\n3. Making a public stink - that's not because she has a right to be upset. That's because she wants to rally people to believe that you are just a mean bully for expecting some basic, common decency from her. She is trying to create or find her FLYING MONKEYS (people who will support her in making you think you are the 'bad guy').\n\nBased on all that, I'm not sure you really want to continue a friendship with her. If you are not quite ready to give up on her, may I suggest a few new steps (some more genuine, some a bit sarcastic):\n\n1. Tell her to give you a call when she is on her way to meet you. Then you will leave your home and meet her at the restaurant. (What will she claim made her late if she's already got her FOUR-YO daughter in her carseat?)\n2. Consider planning to arrive about 35-45 minutes later than scheduled. It would be very interesting to see what happens next. Does your friend continue to consistently arrive after your? When she realizes that you are planning to arrive later than scheduled, does she arrive even later? Does she get mad that you aren't committing to arrive on time even though she never has?\n3. Tell her that you are SOOO sorry to hear she just struggles with being on time for anything (because she can't have trouble with this ONLY when she's visiting with you). You have tons of friends with children who don't have trouble with this and would be happy to have them help her learn how to overcome her challenges with this. You have told them all about how she just isn't capable of being on time, no matter how hard she tries, and they are just chock full of pro-parent tips that she must just not have learned in the past four years. \\[OK, there's a lot of sarcasm here.\\]\n4. Tell her, you'll be happy to meet her at your home. You can agree that one time she and her child come to see you at your home, and the next time you will visit her at her home. On her visits to you, she can still call you when she's leaving so you'll know to expect her about 45 minutes later.\n5. If those options don't work, tell her to let you know when being at least close to on-time is not such a challenge for her. In the meantime, you'll be happy to catch up with her over the phone. She doesn't have to struggle as a parent to get out the door, and you don't have to waste an hour plus waiting.\n\nQuestion: If you were to ask her if she thinks she might be consistently late on purpose because she does resent having to meet you outside her house, would she consider the question and answer you honestly... and be willing to give fair effort to finding some mutually agreeable solutions? If not, I guess I wonder how good a friend she really is.", "NTA. I have twins and I am usually on time for things, or 5-10 minutes late. I don\u2019t like being late and I don\u2019t like it when others are late. Based on her attitude, she thinks her time is more valuable than yours. You warned her you would leave if she was late again and she called your bluff.", "NTA but your friend sure is.\n\nMaybe you need to ask her if she is late for doctor's appointments, for work, and other things.   It is highly disrespectful to be more than 10 minutes late.   She could have easily texted you advising that she was going to be very very late, so you could have done something else in the meanwhile if you wanted to or just canceled it.\n\nIf she is blasting you to the 'mommy' group and it's got back to you obviously they don't feel that it is right for her to be late either or you would have never found out about it.    \n\nFriendship is about respecting one another.   For her to use something like \"mom privileges\" or insult you by saying \"you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it is an insult to injury.    When you have friends like that who needs enemies?", "NTA. \n\nMy kids are 20 months apart. I can count on one hand the number of times I was late for things. M\n\nNo, she doesn\u2019t get to play \u201cthe mom card.\u201d What you\u2019ve learned is that she doesn\u2019t truly care about anyone else other than herself and she sure as hell doesn\u2019t have any respect for anyone else\u2019s time.", "NTA. Arriving late is just being lazy. Those \"Mother Privileges\" are just BS. I always arrive on time to the places I need to be with my little girl, and I am completely useless compared to my wife's skills for handling my daughter. Your friend blaming the kid for her conduct is just horrible.", "Mum of 3 kids here. If I'm late, I'm ten minutes late and it's my fault not the kids. A 4yo is not a toddler. You are NTA.", "My brother in law and sister in law (married couple) are the exact same way. They used to make a big deal of me being 5 minutes late when I had to wrangle 6 kids into the vehicle to go somewhere. I was never more than 10 min late and was almost always  (95% of the time) on time. They had their 1st kid, and they were always at least an hour late. After their 2nd kid, they average 2 to 4 hours late for any and all family functions. At least now that the kids are older and can drive, the kids are on time, but the parents aren't. I just don't get it.  \n\nNTA. Not at all. Your friend does not value you, OP. If they did, they would make an effort to be there on time to see you.", "Very true. And while occasionally things do come up that may make you a little late (or even maybe a lot late), if it is a chronic thing than it is you being inconsiderate.", "That ^\n\nWhen you go out with children, the child-hassle (preparing a diapers/formula bag, changing just before leaving the house, etc) is factored-in the travel time\n\nIf she consistently late, she pissing on you, trying to prove that her time is more valuable then yours", "Oh, it most defenitly happens. And then you shoot a quick text to explain what happend, and to ask if it is okay if you start driving after the shower, or if they want to rescedule. Communication, as always, is key.\n\nEdit because autocorrect is being silly", "If there was some hold up at home she could text before she starts the car giving approximate arrival time. \nShe doesn't because she doesn't value you or your time.", "Yeah I'm a mom of two and I have literally never been late for anything, even with babies. Sometimes you have to start getting ready hours before. When you're a parent, you've got to plan for this.", "NTA. There's nothing for you to understand either. Your \"friend\" think her time is more valuable than yours and that's it.", "NTA I have pretty severe ADHD and my daughter was a hyperactive, escape artist demon disguised as an Angel with the blue eyes and the blond curls. My husband worked away so was gone 80% of the time and on top of that I crushed my left leg when she was 10 months and had years of surgeries so was on crutches a lot and I was never late because I respect other peoples time. My time management is on me and no one else. My demon could literally climb door frames and corners of walls before she was 2 so getting a hold of her was a challenge and wrestling her into a harness, yes she was leashed like a puppy I could not chase her, was like wrestling a slicked pig squeals and everything. I would then grab my toddler backpack that had a pouch for her stuff and my crutches and we would go. She would walk for a while and when she started to want to be dragged around I would tell her to get into the backpack and she would climb me like a tree and get herself in. All while on crutches lol. Anyway squirrel brain, her lack of respect and timeliness is on her. If it happened once is forgivable because shit happens especially as a parent, of course then you call or text and let people know, but if it is a constant thing then the mom privilege goes right out the fucking window. Just because a person chose to reproduce does not mean the world bows to them.", "If you sat down in the coffee shop to find out when she'd arrive, that means she doesn't give you at least a heads up about how big her delay will probably be, just expects you to wait for her. \n\nNTA\n\nThat shows your time is of ZERO value to her.", "NTA. This is so annoying. I get maybe being 10 minutes late, 20 minutes TOPS. But 30+? Uncalled for and disrespectful of your time. Late once or twice, I get it. But if this is a consistent thing that's stuuuupid.\n\nAlso kind of sick of hearing about mothers giving the \"you don't get it\" spiel to childless women over things that barely relate to children at all. *She* *decided* to be a mother and that doesn't mean she gets to behave any way she wants to.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention . . . good for you for setting a very reasonable and healthy boundary and sticking to it!", "NTA. You made a promise to leave and kept it. She hasn't been able to keep her promise of coming on time. Also, she's had multiple chances of getting the timing right to accommodate \"motherhood\"-related delays. Just leave 30 minutes earlier than expected if you're always 30 minutes late.", "\"she only ever came out for my benefit\" wait so... she doesn't benefit from seeing you?", "NTA. It\u2019s not hard to get ready earlier, leaving additional time for \u201cchild wrangling\u201d. Just because you have a child doesn\u2019t give you a free pass for being late all the time.", "An hour late and there wasn't an emergency or a call to let you know what was happening. \n\nNTA", "I have ADHD, and have three kids. Even when I was dealing with a 4yo and twin babies, I was never late on that scale. 10-15 minutes occasionally, sure, because ill-timed diapers or vomiting happens, but I don\u2019t think I was ever an hour late. Now there could be all kinds of things going on for why she\u2019s having that issue, but she needs to own her issues here rather than just expecting everyone to put up with it endlessly. NTA.", "She's annoyed about a 25 minute journey when she was 60 minutes late, so unless the issue was traffic (not her story), then she left 35 minutes after she was supposed to already physically be there.  \nWhatever caused the lateness, not texting your friend at that point is an AH move.", "Yes, your time is precious too. I don't have kids either and have a friend exactly like this. I told her other people are single parents - including your sister - and they aren't an hour late every single time. Once in a while, sure. No worries, I understand. But an hour or so late every time is just lack of organisation and it's not fair on the people who always have to wait for them. She needs to start getting organised earlier. It's just disrespectful to make people wait so long all the time.", "I was gonna say YTA but you are NTA. She was 25 min away but took over an hour? Idk man\u2026", "NTA i have a verd strong willed four year old and a baby and i am never more than 10 minutes late. Because i care about other peoples time and consider it very impolite and inconsiderate to be late. Just plan ahead and leave earlier than you would without the kids.", "NTA\n\nShe is just using her kid as an excuse to be a crappy friend. If she really cared she would leave earlier than required to give her the extra time to 'wrangle' her kid.", "Look, it's hard with a toddler. Very hard. My kid slowed me down every goddamn minute. That's why I built in extra time whenever I made plans. If I'm supposed to be there at 4 and it takes twenty minutes to get there, I swear to God, I'd start prepping two hours before. \n\nI was late occasionally. But late meant ten-fifteen minutes tops. And that wasn't regularly.

She could have texted or called you. \u201eSorry (OP) but I am running late\u201c \n\nBut being late and blaming everything on her kid? Nope. If you know you have got a habit of running late, start earlier. She has no respect for you and your time.", "Seems like she is a mean girl. She truly believes her time is more important than your time. She doesn't respect you and certainly has a very skewered understanding of friendship. \n\nIt appears you are so beneath common courtesy and do not deserve a call or text that she is running late to give you the option of choosing to wait or get on with your day.  \n\nShe is completely in the wrong and yet is disparaging you to others.  \n\nYou deserve better. \n\nNTA.", "Sometimes I'm late, especially if I have to take all the kids. But I'm never more than 10 minutes and if I'm late I will text the people I'm meeting.  An hour late GTFO, and stop blaming your kid.

There is no thing like a \"mom privilege\", and it is beyond rude to tell someone \"you do not understand because you do not have kids\".\n\nHow difficult is it to add an extra 30 minutes when you are going to meet someone to account for some unpredictable things that may happen if you are traveling with your kid? If she was late from time to time and apologized profusely because Katie had an accident and she had to change her clothes, I would understand. But claiming some ridiculous BS about \"mom privilege\" is just pathetic.", "NTA. She was over an hour late. That means she left her house more than 30 mins after she was supposed to meet OP. Her kid is four - she's not really a toddler. Sure, there's last minute \"oh I need the toilet\" and \"where are my shoes\" and \"I don't want to leave the house today\" - but she didn't even bother to contact OP to say they would be late?\n\nHow's this friend going to cope when Katie starts school - complain to the principal that school don't understand how difficult it is to get a kid up in the morning?", "I have 4 children.\n99.9% of their lives, I get us everywhere early.\nYour friend is being an idiot and disrespectful to you\nNTA", "NTA this is a constant, not a one off thing and it sounds like she didn't message you.\n\nThat being said, you don't know what he kid might have issues with.

They are not mutually exclusive, and Katie is both", "NTA.   To be that late consistently is because the friend does not value your time. \n\nAlso, if you are going to be that late, you know it.  Sounds like the friend is 25min away by car.   Friend should have known well in advance that she was going to be late and should have texted or called.   e.g. at 10 til, you let your friend know you're running late.  Not an hour after the meeting time. \n\nI agree with the others here.  Time to put a pause on the friendship, or at least, pause with the meetings like this one.   Perhaps invite her to things where being on time doesn't matter, like brunch with a group of mutual friends or a group bbq or picnic or something.   Basically, don't agree to anything where her being late is going to inconvenience you.", "NTA. Having a baby doesn't excuse being a poor human being.", "NTA. \n\nBeing late sometimes is understandable, or being a few minutes late is whatever in parenting world.
