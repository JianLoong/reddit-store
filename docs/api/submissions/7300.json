And when we visit for the holidays we have a 9pm curfew. I think this is all very generous of him, and see no issue with his rules. My sister of course got the same rules freshmen year, and hates them.

She told me she did drink at a party in October, but that was it. I immediately called my stepdad in, and made her confess. She's cut off, and has to move back home. She has a week to find a job or she's out. She claims she's disowning me over this, but I think I did right by my stepdad.

Why wouldn't you be the asshole?", "YTA. How did only some of your friends tell you that you\u2019re an AH?", "YTA\n\nI don't condone underage drinking and think your stepdad's rules are a little too controlling, but this was pure spite. You're hiding behind your respect for your stepdad, while it sounds like you really wanted to hurt your sister.", "YTA.  Do you actually think that it's appropriate and proportionate for your sister to lose out on college tuition because she had one drink in October?  What if she, an adult woman, stayed out until 9:15 one night and snuck back in?  Would you have reported that too?\n\nWhile it is very generous of your stepfather to pay for both your education, that doesn't mean that his conditions are reasonable, or that violating the conditions in a very small way merits the cancellation of the life-changing benefit.  \n\nYou are very clearly annoyed with your sister, calling her immature and ungrateful, and not talking to her for several months.  I believe that you were setting her up when you asked her if she was obeying the rules, and that you had every intention of reporting her failure to meet any of the conditions to your stepfather to punish her.  How is setting yourself up as your stepfather's enforcer \"doing right\" by him?  Do you think he had an expectation that you'd question and set up your sister?  \n\nI think you'd benefit from asking yourself, very thoughtfully and honestly, what you intended to have happen when you asked your sister if she was following the rules.  What were you hoping to accomplish?  What was your endgame?", "100% YTA\n\nYou baited her to provide info under the implicit assumption that you were asking in confidence. You then immediately rattled her put. Prick move.", "YTA. First of all, the rules are not reasonable at all. Second of all, your stepdad is wrong to try to dictate your lives by misuse of money. And third of all, you are a horrible brother for telling on her. She wasn't in any kind of danger. You should have had her back with these unreasonable rules in the first place. And now you impacted the rest of her life negatively because she was just acting age-appropriate.", "Your stepfather is using his finacial power to control your sister's life and you're enabling his control by being a tattle tale.

Ruining her future like that because she confessed something? Of course she'll go NC.", "This is some of the most unkind, willfully harmful things I\u2019ve ever read in this entire subreddit.

Also you stated in some of your replies that you told him out of fear of him ever finding out himself that you\u2019d be cut off for knowing, why the hell would you ask her in the first place then?

You're also an awful brother and I hope she manages to get free of your family.", "YTA. You became a kiss-ass just cuz your education is being paid for. You can still be grateful and respectful without throwing your sister under the bus. She didn\u2019t say she was drinking all the time. She said it happened once.

How do those boots taste?", "Yta. First of all most of those rules are ridiculous and controlling.

Your sister should go full NC with you, and maybe the rest of your toxic family.  I don\u2019t even understand your motivation here.

That's a load of horseshit no one is going to believe. His conditions are ridiculous and you know it.", "These actions reek of jealousy. Was your sister doing better than you academically? Cannot you not accept your sister outshining you? Hopefully she cuts off you and your stepfather. You both sound like nasty, controlling men.", "YTA - i could see if she was an out of control drunk. Missing classes and flunking out. She drank once and thats amazing considering. She trusted you enough to confide and in and you immediately ring the bell? Do you even like your sister? I wouldn\u2019t speak to you ever again either.", "YTA\n\nWhy is it your concern?\n\nYou do you boo, stick to them rules all you like a be grateful for the handouts.\n\nBut don\u2019t snitch, it\u2019s a horrible thing to do", "YTA, and so petty!!

Congratulations op, hope it was worth it.", "YTA couldn\u2019t wait to tell on your sister. I\u2019d cut you off for sure because you can\u2019t be trusted.

Stop wasting your time meddling in stuff that doesn't concern you and she's.right to cut you off", "Hooo boy. Your step dad\u2019s rules are abusive. I\u2019d be worried about what other \u201crules\u201d she was made to comply with. You don\u2019t know everything that happened between them, I promise you. She agreed because she\u2019s young and knew all of her other options were shit. As someone paying off her undergrad loans at 38, I can tell you she had no choice.\n\nYou must\u2019ve been looking for a way to torpedo your relationship with your sister, because you don\u2019t feel as loyal to her as you do to your stepdad, which is weird considering how he is not your blood and she is. And he doesn\u2019t sound like a good guy at all.\n\nAre you a church kid? Is this a Jesus/purity thing and you feel entitled because she is \u201csinning\u201d? \n\nY such an AH", "Yes.

You caused her hardship over one night she told you about in confidence. As siblings you follow the same rules, but that doesn't mean it's your job to blow the whistle. Unless she presented a danger to herself or others, her rule breaking for one night was None of your business. What did you honestly expect? What did you have to gain by ratting her out? A gold star?\n\nDon't be surprised if she never speaks to you again over this. Your actions have cost her stability, ruined her career before it even got started, dashed her dreams, and overall proven that it is not safe for her to talk to you, because you cannot be trusted. You should have never gotten involved, it's not like you planned on picking up the tab for her education or place to stay.\n\nI really fail to see the point of what you did, but I hope it was worth it.", "YTA. Your dad is insane and your awful for ruining such a critical opportunity.", "YTA.\n\nAnd if you ever thought you'd have a relationship with her, well, you just put a hole RIGHT through its head.", "yta \n\nKeep your side of the street clean and worry about yourself.", "Tell me you have daddy issues without telling me you have daddy issues", "YTA snitch", "YTA.

Better hope you never need a kidney or something like that.", "YTA. Not even a doubt yta. You just cost your sister a college education because she drank at 1 party 4 months ago. You and your step dad are way over the top and I hope your sister goes on to a much better life that you will never know about.", "YTA. Those rules are strict, unreasonable and unnessicerily controlling. You went out out of your way to get her in trouble for something that wasn't harming or negatively impacting other people.

You and your sister are not kids anymore. Those rules are treating you both like you are.\n\nFor two: she did it once at a party. I\u2019d get it if she were an alcoholic but it was once and you immediately tell on her?
