I didn't want her to struggle as a young, single mother, and I believed adoption might provide the baby with a better life.\n\nEmma took her time to think things through and ultimately decided to keep the baby.

It sounds like it was the only option but it really wasn't. I'm not saying that you need to take care of her kid, it's her kid so it's her responsibility. There are other things that you can do to help your family, that kid is your grandkid and maybe talking out a support plan would have been better. It could have probably been something minor like helping to buy diapers and baby stuff. Kicking her out was not in her best interest and I think you know that.", "You couldn't bear the thought of her struggling so you're making her struggles worse?? YTA.\n\nGo find a way to help and support your daughter if you love her.", "YTA. The *first* thing you mention is that you feel too young to be a grandfather, and that says a lot about how you\u2019re approaching this. 19 is young, yes, but not ridiculously so, and you say yourself that Emma took the time to think her decision through. It\u2019s her body, her choice, and her child. You don\u2019t have to agree with her decision in order to support her. You have a LOT of work to do if you hope to repair your relationship with your daughter.", "Yeah, YTA, and you should feel guilty.\n\nI agree with you that 19 is young to be a mum, let alone a single mum, but this was a stupid ultimatum to make, and an even stupider one to follow through on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I wanted what I thought was best for her and the baby. I didn't want her to struggle as a young, single mother, and I believed adoption might provide the baby with a better life.\"\n\nYou couldn't have expressed this without setting an ultimatum? Ultimatums rarely end well, because you either end up hurting someone or hurting yourself, and in this case you've managed to do both. Furthermore, you've managed to do the opposite of what you wanted - instead of being part of a support system to your daughter and grandchild, you've actively taken support away from them.\n\nIf this post had been about you being *unable* to support your daughter and grandchild, then that would've been one thing, but the fact that you frame this as \"wanting the best for her\" but going about it in what is probably the dumbest ways possible, and then doubling down on that, absolutely makes you the AH.", "YTA.\n\nI understand you wanted what you thought was best for her, but it\u2019s her body; her choice. Also, adoption can be traumatic for everyone involved, so giving her an ultimatum to push her into putting her kid up for adoption is wild to me.\n\nTake a step back and imagine your life in 5 years. Do you wanna be the estranged dad and grandpa? Or do you wanna be apart of their lives. \n\nApologies to her, let her move back in. And help her set up some saving goals so that she eventually can move out on her own terms. Help her create a safe environment for her kid and your grandchild.", "YTA - a father is there for his daughter. Simple as that. It\u2019s not too late to fix this.

You\u2019ll regret it forever if you don\u2019t.", "You don\u2019t want her to struggle but kicked her out. Read that sentence a few times. Yta.", "YTA.  First, while I'm not sure how far along your daughter was when she broke the news or where you live, it's weird to me that the only 2 options as you saw it were adoption or her keeping the baby.  I may be reading between the lines here, but I suspect this is because you raised your daughter to believe abortion was not a viable option or was \"wrong.\"  And if that's how you raised her, then it's no wonder she'd feel like she needs to keep this baby.  Her choice in this difficult situation is likely directly related to her upbringing &, thus, largely your fault.  You should take some accountability for that.\n\nThe abortion inquiry aside, you acted like a total AH in this situation.  You say you're worried about your daughter's future as a single mom, but by kicking her out, you are most certainly limiting her chances for success in the future.  This move is probably dooming your daughter & to be grandchild to a future (at least an immediate one) of poverty, hardship & struggles.  Your daughter needs your love & support in this situation, & instead, you rejected her.\n\nFurther, your comment about not wanting to be a grandparent at this point in your life is awful.  Guess what OP; this isn't about you, it's about your daughter!  If you want to keep your daughter in your life & have a relationship w/your future grandchild(ren), you should apologize to your daughter asap.  Do better OP.\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA.

We can speculate that somebody made some very questionable decisions resulting in a pregnancy at 19.  But sex happens.  It does no good to punish the pregnant girl after-the-fact.  \n\nStill, it's not good to compound one mistake with another.   If the girl can't take care of herself, then she certainly can't take care of herself AND baby.\n\nSo I see this as a -tough love- situation.  You gave her a choice, and she chose wrong.  Probably because she's still in her teenage \"I KNOW EVERYTHING\" phase.  You were right to stick by your word and kick her out of the house.  That is EXACTLY the motivation she needs right now.\n\nShe can learn to \"adult\" by the sink-or-swim method.  There is no other way for that to happen, as she's literally out of time.  She will either grow a brain, come back to you and tell you that she will give it up for adoption.

Accidents are unexpected by their very nature. I would agree that there's no such thing as \"accidental *sex*\" but there is definitely such a thing as accidental pregnancy. If two consenting adults have sex, and they've been smart enough to use a condom, but the condom breaks, that's an accident. They didn't *intend* for it to break, but it did--by *accident*.", "I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re just OP\u2019s sock puppet lol", "But at 42, saying \"you can do this alone when I could help you but won't\" *is* responsible?

Because anybody with a tax rate higher than ZERO would disagree with you, vehemently.", "Me too. 100%.", "Are you making shit up right now?  Last I checked, it took years of background checks to qualify to APPLY for adopting.  While I admit I am ignorant of what qualifies as a good candidate to adopt a baby, I would be willing to bet that some verifiable source of substantial, stable income would be high on the qualifying checklist....", ">Are you joking?

Before you engage in sex (protected or not) you need to understand the risks and accept the risks.  If you are acting responsibly, there is no accidental pregnancy.   Just pregnancies that defied the odds.  But you have to know that MIGHT happen before you insert tab A into slot B.  There is no 100% effective birth control.  Even using multiple forms of birth control, it still takes deliberate action to get pregnant.  It might be a surprise, but it's definitely no accident.", "Nahhhh.  Just a very pissed-off conservative, leaning toward the RIGHT.  And a proud MAGA Trump fanatic.

Supporting kid and kid's kid will cost an extra $3000 a month, roughly.  Assuming they live in a reasonable cost of living area.  I don't know if the OP has that kind of \"fun money\" to blow.  And if he did, could he still max out his retirement investments?  Because those should have started by now (or many years ago).  Sometimes the responsible thing to do is to say \"NO\".\n\n\"Shunning your child is responsible? \"\n\nRegrettably, this can be more responsible than condoning irresponsible decisions.\n\n\"Showing your other kids that you won't be there for them if they mess up is responsible?\"\n\nOH HELL YES!!!!!

You have no idea what the money part actually looks like but have assumed everything.\n\nI really hope you're not a parent or ever plan on becoming one. Parenting is all about nuance. Sometimes your kids find themselves in situations that have no winning outcome. It's your job as a parent to help them through as best you can. You seem to appreciate none of that. Perpetuating a relationship of fear as a parent is completely unhealthy. JFC you don't understand people at all, do you?", "So let's just keep rewarding mistakes until everybody pays 100% of their income to the government to take care of all the safety nets.  \n\n(oh why do I bother?  This IS Reddit, after all...)", ">JFC you don't understand people at all, do you?\n\nSure I do.  That is why I know that rewarding irresponsible behavior leads to more irresponsible behavior.\n\nIf we assume the family is wealthy and OP could take care of all the kid's and grandkids needs...\n\nIt still wouldn't be right to reward the kid for this mistake.
