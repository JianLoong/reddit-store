That\u2019s a pretty run-of-the-mill watch. I was expecting neon or whacky design.

Sounds like you need to get out more.", "I work in recruitment, I couldn\u2019t care less what watch someone was wearing. YTA", "By acquired taste then you actually mean not to yours. Not to mine either but it's silly to assume your opinion is fact", "YTA. As someone who does interviews, I can say that not one person takes note of a watch. We do take note of the clothes but unless you have facial piercings we don\u2019t really care about accessories.", "YTA, that\u2019s a minuscule detail, and certainly a matter of taste.  I thought it would be a giant dinosaur watch or flashing lights or something.  He won\u2019t be affected in an interview by that.  Maybe ask yourself what your motivation was in speaking up - are you perhaps a bit of a snob, or even jealous of the present?  Imo you owe your family an apology.", "YTA I think the problem here is that you are a bit of a watch snob. My guess is that going into an interview they probably don\u2019t care.  Things are also very different now with watches. I change my watch band out almost daily so it can match my outfits.  Some are more colorful than others. I also feel like people are willing to spend more on watches now that they are an extension of your telephone. As far as old fashioned watches most people probably don\u2019t care and unless it\u2019s a Rolex have no idea if it\u2019s a cheap or expensive watch.\n\nEdit: I saw the picture of the watch. I don\u2019t see the problem here. It\u2019s a perfectly ordinary old fashioned watch.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a watch. No one cares. Why are you freaking them out before an interview?", "YTA. Tbh, I think the majority of men\u2019s watches are ugly and wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at this one. I was expecting it to be covered in fake diamonds so I\u2019m actually disappointed.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, OP: just based on how you speak in this post and the *things* that you choose to emphasize, I\u2019m going to put money on the likelihood that your aunt\u2019s bang on and you are a pretentious AH.", "YTA. I\u2019d wear that watch everywhere and think it looks great. You are all the things your Aunt called you, she appears to be a good judge of character.", "YTA.\n\nThere are two parts to this:\n\nGiving him advice is fine, except given the fact he was excited to wear this \\[relatively normal\\] watch to an interview, I don't think it warranted you to suggest he shouldn't, not unless the watch was OTT and a distraction. Your advice was unnecessary, especially since it obviously would've given him confidence wearing it. If I was his mother/your aunt, I would've taken exception too. The fact she said she was *\"extremely displeased with the person \\[I've\\] grown into it\",* it would suggest to me that you typically make these sort of remarks.\n\nThe other part to this is, how could you possibly believe you're in any position to *demand* an apology?\n\nIn the future, I think you're better served to keep these thoughts to yourself.", "YTA. If the watch you link in your post, why would anyone give a shit about that watch? It's just a cheap invicta watch. Dude, where is your head? Recruiters are looking at their presentation and for brains with the ability to learn.

He's not getting a huge \"flavor flav\" style of clock on a necklace, but you sure act like he does. Chances are your cousing agreed and thanked you to make you stop talking.", "YTA. No recruiter or interviewer is going to give a second look at that watch unless they want to know where to get one", "YTA I clicked the link for the watch expecting this garish gaudy monstrosity, and what I saw was a reasonably restrained black and gold watch.

In what world?", "YTA you seem like the type of person who would pass on hiring a qualified applicant because you didn't like their watch.", "Yta, that watch is not over the top, it\u2019s not an acquired taste, and even if it was those things you are overthinking the situation.

Speaking as someone who enjoys fashion and clothing, I still think watch culture is fucking weird and a bit elitist. It's just a fucking watch, if he was going to bomb a job interview because he was wearing a weird watch then that job is likely not worth the trouble.", "YTA, but only for saying it in front of the gifters. That watch looks like it's gonna sell me crypto, and I would absolutely assume whoever wore it was an ass.", "Unless the watch has a pic of a girl spreading her legs (each leg is either the minute or hour hand) YTA", "YTA. From the description, I was expecting it to be neon green with purple spots on it or something. Even then you'd still be the AH.\n\nI just see an ordinary watch.", "I've interviewed people, that watch is nothing to care about.", "YTA You realise you are dissing the man's mum, by insinuating she gave him a tacky gift? That's just rude.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is 21, and it is an internship. The watch is fine for that.", "Strong YTA here.

The pope? \nIf anyone should apologise, it's you and you only.", "I once had a watch that had ethel merman swimming around in it to tell the time.  Kept breaking the high profile plastic bubble (to give ethel space to swim).  I would definitely have worn that to an interview!\n\nSoft YTA.  You gotta let people be who they are.", "I\u2019m stuck between soft YTA and full blown YTA. It\u2019s gonna be a YTA regardless. Absolutely, a watch doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things and you sound like a watch snob considering your nitpicking. Your cousin\u2019s just happy to wear it, what\u2019s the harm in that? What was the point of raining on his parade? \n\nThe advice you gave your cousin I can understand, wanting the best outcome for the interview and removing whatever can come between that. Benefit of the doubt, you\u2019re not the watch snob your family and I assume you are and you\u2019re just looking out for the guy. It\u2019s a fine reason, but not warranted by any means. Maybe that watch was his good luck charm of sorts, it certainly gave him that extra boost to go through with interviews. \n\nNow why do you feel entitled to an apology? At the end of the day, you made unnecessary commentary about a *watch*", "YTA and ridiculous.", "I think your aunt is trying to go to bat for your cousin considering the enthusiasm he had about wearing that watch for his interviews and perhaps she's viewing this as you dampening that excitement. But she might have also taken it as a slight personal insult as its a gift she gave her child maybe with the intent of him wearing it on the job and her taste is now called into question.\n\nBecause while you are correct in that it is loud on its own, if worn in a darker colour palette it wouldn't be considered \"out there\". \n\nNow that being said, your cousin took your constructive advice well and as long as you weren't digging in at him and making your own opinions on the watch itself known (calling it tacky or whatever), then I don't think you're an AH. \n\nNTA.", "I think your intentions meant well. I personally agree with you. However, I don't think most people would notice the watch. I think your aunt went a little overboard with the insulting, but if your cousin agreed with you in the end... then maybe it makes you in the right. Who knows, lol", "NTA obviously.\n\nI knew it was going to be an Invicta. Lol\n\nYou gave good advice from both a theoretical and real life stand point. That watch is a clown watch lol. Reading the comments here it\u2019s clear most posters have no class or taste. Because if you did you\u2019d know that\u2019s a clown watch.\n\nIf anyone saw that 50+ mm piece on someone\u2019s wrist in real life they wouldn\u2019t be commenting on how normal or nice it is. It\u2019s literally trash.", "I think the watch is fine. It\u2019s a divers watch,just a little on the loud side", "YTA. I\u2019m pretty sure no employer is going to care  about the color and type of watch on his wrist. You\u2019re ridiculous.", "Storm in a teacup. The watch doesn\u2019t matter, but don\u2019t bother apologising or demanding an apology either, it\u2019ll all blow over.", "Depends on what the interview is for. \n\nNo, I don't care if my plumber dresses like a pimp...\n\nYes, I do care if my lawyer has no sense of taste and looks cheap.", "YTA\n\nWhen you said loud I imagined the watch was actually making a lot of noise with each tick, and was ready to give you NTa.\n\nBut you meant loud as in appearance.

While I disagree with you, you have nothing to apologize for.

I can see that you were just trying to help as I would consider this watch to be garish.", "NTA I looked at the watch again and not only is it loud it is also large. I don't know what field he is in but that watch would be an unwelcome eyesore for many professions.", "Judgment is NTA.  Yes, the watch is hideous.  But people are not judged for their taste in interviews.  As long you are dressed appropriately, ie not jeans and a shirt for an interview that requires a suit, no one cares.  You were probably trying to come from a helpful place, but the reason you are getting flack from your aunt is that you are criticizing her choice of gift/her taste not because you advised on what to wear for his interviews.   I wouldn't have said anything personally, but I don't believe doing so really makes you an AH.  You should just have stayed quiet.  That's it.", "nah, NTA. you were just trying to help out your cousin with some advice. not a big deal.", "The response from your family was over the top, but there\u2019s also nothing wild or \u201cloud\u201d about the watch.
