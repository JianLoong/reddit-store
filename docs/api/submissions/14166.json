It was decided that all their 5 kids would sleep in my room since it has the most floor space for air mattresses and it's own bathroom so kids could go pee easily. They're all little so I guess the hallway and the living room with the big glass doors was too scary at night. I wasn't a fan of this idea, but I didn't have a choice. I have a loft bed thought so I had a little private space to myself.\n\nI don't go to sleep as early as them so I was up in my bed playing video games. Around 11pm someone turned on the lights. When I took of my headphones I heard one of the kids screaming. I didn't really get what was going on, but my aunt and uncle took her out of the room. My mom and my other aunt got all the other kids to quiet down and go to bed. So I went back to my game and eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning I find out that the cousin that was screaming had been trying to get my attention because she needed to pee, but was too afraid to use my bathroom because someone had turned off the light that was supposed to be left on for them. She saw that I was awake and was trying to ask me for help. When I didn't answer her she tried climbing up the ladder to my bed. She fell and ended up dislocating her arm.\n\nEveryone wanted to know what happened and why I didn't help her. I said I didn't hear her because of my headphones. Everyone started ganging up on me saying I should have known better than to wear noise canceling headphones since I baby sit. My uncle is the most angry and said that I need to learn to use my fucking head. But I babysit older kids and no one even said I was babysitting so I don't think it's fair for them to say it's my fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I told my dad about them all blaming me when he got home and he told them it wasn't my fault or responsibility.

No one discussed the concept of you babysitting said children, so there's no reason to expect you to have taken any special level of responsibility for said children. You are in your own room, living your life as close to normally as you can in the situation.\n\nIt's unreasonable of them to have expected you to just fully think about any possible implications and assume responsibility for other people in general. But you sound like you're a teenager, ergo still a kid yourself, and it's even less understandable to assume another child would just innately assume responsibility over everyone else in the room without a discussion about it. And there's no valid reason why you shouldn't be able to listen to stuff on your headphones like you normally would \\_UNLESS\\_ you had explicitly been asked to, and then agreed to, act as a semi-sitter for those kids.\n\n100% not on you. It's an unfortunate accident, and I'd suggest the only reason anyone is even blaming you at all is that it's really natural to look to blame someone/something when an accident happens. It's not the girl's fault she was scared or trying to get your attention, it's not gravity's fault for pulling stuff down, so by process of elimination this means it has to somehow be your fault.

Who\u2019s the person who turned off the light the kids were supposed to have on? No one\u2019s blaming them no? Plus people can\u2019t just bounce responsibility of their kids off onto somebody else without even explicitly asking first. It\u2019s not like your were asked and given instructions on precautions to take with the kids. \n\nsucks what happened to the little one but at the end of the day shit happens, kids get hurt and like my granny always said \u201cit\u2019ll be gone before their wedding day.\u201d", "NTA.

Especially with an upcoming funeral where I assume being the young ones usually comes with pole barring duty at funerals.

Sounds like tensions are also high since it's also a funeral everyone is here for, and a dislocated arm now isn't helping the stress. Uncle needs to chill but I assume it's his daughter so he's frustrated (again should have made her stay with you (dad) bucko).

They play a big warning before the movie starts. I've seen \"please mute your cell phone\" announcements that had better production values than some movies. The fact that so much resources go into conveying this message indicates that yes, people do need to be told.", "All the funerals we have in our family are small and only consisted of the people closest to that person. The only funeral I remember attending, was my grandpa's on my mom's side, as all my grandparents passed before I was 8. For his funeral there were only about 7 people in attendance, my mom, her 2 sisters, her 2 brothers,his personal nurse, and me. It was just a 3 hr event at a grave yard. \n\n\nI never even attended my uncle's funeral cause I wasn't invited do not being that close to him, even though we visited them 1-2 times a month for a weekend for nearly 10yrs. The max people at his funeral was 9. His wife, 4 kids, his 3 sisters (one of which was my mom) and his brother. \n\n\nIt's like a general rule that unless it's a life or death emergency, you negotiate child care with family member if you don't want to watch your own kids.\n\n\nThough I have never heard of work flow in a family dynamic. I've only ever heard of work flow used in an actual job context. We don't think of family matters as a job. Also for another of your examples I don't think we have ever had an \"Until the jobs done\" moment. We always have \"Until it's good enough\" moments. Or variations of that. You hear a lot of \"Eh good enough\" or \"That's good enough for milk and cookies\" in my family when it comes to anything family related.", "NTA, this should be the responsibility of the adults. THey are horrible parents/aunts/uncles for allowing this situation to happen, and doubly so for blaming this on you.\n\nI get why they were sleeping in your room, it was a sort of emergency. What I don't get that one of their parents did not sleep there with them. Or why they ASSUMED OP would take charge of them WITHOUT ASKING.\n\nAgain, I get that this was a family emergency, and it would perhaps have been reasonable to ask OP to \"babysit\" them for that one night, but to dump them in her room WITHOUT asking is just beyond me. And blaming her for what happened even beyonder.", "Not really an emergency, funerals are planned events, not spur of the moment things", "I\u2019m happy your dad had your back! \n\nDefinitely not your fault.  Are they trying to imply you were supposed to be babysitting? If so, that should\u2019ve been discussed and they owe you some money! \n\nWearing headphones was the right thing. I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve complained if you hadn\u2019t.", "NTA if they wanted you to babysit, they should have asked and gotten your agreement to babysit. They are responsible for their children, and they are responsible for making sure that someone else are prepared and willing to take over that responsibility temporarily when that's needed. One never assumes when it comes to this kind of thing, so that's on them. Sharing room with so many children, in particular when you don't all go to bed at the same time is a very understandable situation for using your headphones. I hope you won't beat yourself too much up about this.", "NTA the whole floor space for air mattresses thing feels like a convenient excuse to squeeze all the kids in your room so that the parents can sleep peacefully while you\u2019re stuck taking care of the kids all night, and they expected you\u2019d be doing it because you babysit.", "NTA, were they paying you to babysit? No, so it's not on you to \"use your head\" and not wear your headphones in case they needed you, as you were not on duty. I'm glad your dad is sticking up for you and let you know that, I hope your cousin is okay. Just know that the onus is on her parents, not you.", "But who wears NOISE CANCELLING earphones with little kids in the room. ESH.", "If you were babysitting them that would be one thing, but you were not. \n\nThe uncle that told you to use your head, he needs to be told to watch his own damn kid. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you were asleep.

Yes the situation sucks and is unfair to you but it's not the kids fault to be left unwatched and hurt.", "NTA.\n\nYou weren't brought to the attention that one of them was scared of the dark. Lights get turned off out of habit by other kids or left on.\n\nDid the parents even think that they may need to bring a night light along incase something like that may happen?\n\nPlus, sharing a room with kids isn't fun if you're a night owl or work night shifts as you have to find a way to keep that sleep schedule.", "NTA. \n\nThe parents shouldn\u2019t have put little kids in an unfamiliar room with a ladder in it.", "NTA - you should question their parenting. Ask them when exactly they asked and you agreed to babysit? Ask for the confirmation! \n\nAsk them if you rang child protection and put forth their understanding, that an immature 16 yr old was put in charge of 5 kids under 6, without prior agreement, which resulted in harm coming to a child, that this was a responsible parenting choice? \n\nThen finish by saying maybe they should be using their f*cking heads as adults.", "NTA\n\nBut seriously what brand of earphones do you have? Cause I\u2019ve never had a pair that could cancel out a screaming kid. I need these!", "NTA The evil side of me thinks you should inform them if they want you to babysit then it is $20 -$40 per kid; paid in advance for you to loose sleep.

You have the right to play in silence.  I feel bad for the kid getting hurt but not ur fault", "NTA. I was in the same same situation as you a year ago. While I get the logistics behind it, I told them to take care of their own kids, I was not their babysitter.", "This is ridiculous, especially as all these children were forced on you. Parents are always responsible for their own children, so it's very easy and convenient to pin this on you. If you ant to comfortably sleep or play video game because some diaper diver is too chickenshit to enter an unlit room, that's *not* your problem.\n\nNTA. I always hated giving up my room for guests. I had these second cousins over, forcing me to go sleep in the attic. The lights in the landing were always on, and I need darkness to sleep. And there was no door or hatch between the landing and the attic. Great. Next night, the lights in the toilet and bathroom were kept on. But it was still Summer and fucking hot where I slept, making me cranky and tired in the morning.\n\nMy brother criticised me for not being too social with those brats. Which was ironic, because the year before he complained that he was always working - by choice, I might add - and I was always gallivanting with those kids.\n\nStill, nothing like the drama in your story really happened. Actually, a year or so later, the *kids* slept in the attic and we had a little gate installed that prevented them from accidentally falling down the stairs. But they opened it, and the youngest held unto it, and it came off. Just a little scare, perhaps some bruises. And a whole lot of noise, of course. Plus my parents were mad because, despite them claiming to be thirsty, they were supposed to stay put.", "NTA, need to ask what noise cancelling headphones u have though? They sound brilliant", "NTA. Pretty sure you offered your place to stay over, not to babysit. Therefore you had 0 responsibility. Their parents kept every responsibility over their kids.\n\nYou need to learn to be a bit more assertive if you ask me. Ignore them? Hell no! Tell them it's their kids, their responsibility. Their kids are afraid to walk to some dark? Then keep your kids closer so you're there for that part. Non of this was your responsibility, so don't let them blame you.", "NTA. They're trying to guilt you so they don't have to accept blame.", "NTA\nyou're not an adult and no one is paying you and no one discussed this with you other than sharing a room.\nthey should be mad at themselves, really.\n\nthat said - next time i would recommend turning off the nose canceling, is there really that much noise that late? it could've prevented an argument and yknow, you're the big cousin, your younger cousins will appreciate your help, even if it's slightly under duress. but absolutely NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Everyone started ganging up on me saying I should have known better than to wear noise canceling headphones since I baby sit.\" ...

That's on ALL THE PARENTS who approved this situation. You dad is off the hook because he has told you its not your fault (meaning that he isn't blaming you for not following instructions you weren't given).
