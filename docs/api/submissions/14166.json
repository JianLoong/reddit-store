No one discussed the concept of you babysitting said children, so there's no reason to expect you to have taken any special level of responsibility for said children. You are in your own room, living your life as close to normally as you can in the situation.\n\nIt's unreasonable of them to have expected you to just fully think about any possible implications and assume responsibility for other people in general. But you sound like you're a teenager, ergo still a kid yourself, and it's even less understandable to assume another child would just innately assume responsibility over everyone else in the room without a discussion about it. And there's no valid reason why you shouldn't be able to listen to stuff on your headphones like you normally would \\_UNLESS\\_ you had explicitly been asked to, and then agreed to, act as a semi-sitter for those kids.\n\n100% not on you. It's an unfortunate accident, and I'd suggest the only reason anyone is even blaming you at all is that it's really natural to look to blame someone/something when an accident happens. It's not the girl's fault she was scared or trying to get your attention, it's not gravity's fault for pulling stuff down, so by process of elimination this means it has to somehow be your fault. Except it's not, and that's all just a string of fallacious thinking. This isn't anyone's fault, it's a freakin accident", "**NTA -** I\u2019m really sorry to hear that the blame for this is being placed on you, it must be weighing very heavy on your conscience, but in my opinion, I don\u2019t think you are to blame at all.   \nI think you are well within your right to have your own little space while you share your room, I think nearly every person on earth would put on headphones at night in that situation, including the people who are blaming you for it. Who\u2019s the person who turned off the light the kids were supposed to have on? No one\u2019s blaming them no? Plus people can\u2019t just bounce responsibility of their kids off onto somebody else without even explicitly asking first. It\u2019s not like your were asked and given instructions on precautions to take with the kids. \n\nsucks what happened to the little one but at the end of the day shit happens, kids get hurt and like my granny always said \u201cit\u2019ll be gone before their wedding day.\u201d", "NTA.

You weren\u2019t babysitting, you were being forced to share space. The best thing would have been for the kids to stay with their parents regardless. They have no one to blame but themselves for what happened as did they just expect you to sit and do nothing all night.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility considering you weren\u2019t told to babysit and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t even think about such a thing happening.

You weren\u2019t babysitting and the kids are the responsibility of their parents.  I feel bad for your cousin but it was an accident.

They didn't want to deal with little tantrums or find a damn flashlight or nightlight for the kids to sleep with their parents, that's on them. It is sorry that someone got hurt, but in absolutely no way was it your fault. That kid couldn't go pee because big scary dark bathroom but not big scary ladder? Kinda odd but sure. Kids are weird. Everyone needs to calm down a bit, think about what was said, and prepare better for next time. I hope someone steps up for you. This is the most I can do.", "NTA. You were never asked to babysit.

Especially with an upcoming funeral where I assume being the young ones usually comes with pole barring duty at funerals. It was an accident these things happen and honestly if little one was that scared at night she should have been staying with mom and dad. Sounds like tensions are also high since it's also a funeral everyone is here for, and a dislocated arm now isn't helping the stress. Uncle needs to chill but I assume it's his daughter so he's frustrated (again should have made her stay with you (dad) bucko).

Otherwise, they\u2019re kind of the assholes for not giving the room to the family of 7 IMO\u2026 \n\nEither way, you are NTA. 5 kids that young is A LOT.
