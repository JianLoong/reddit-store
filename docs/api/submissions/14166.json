It was decided that all their 5 kids would sleep in my room since it has the most floor space for air mattresses and it's own bathroom so kids could go pee easily. They're all little so I guess the hallway and the living room with the big glass doors was too scary at night. I wasn't a fan of this idea, but I didn't have a choice. I have a loft bed thought so I had a little private space to myself.\n\nI don't go to sleep as early as them so I was up in my bed playing video games. Around 11pm someone turned on the lights. When I took of my headphones I heard one of the kids screaming. I didn't really get what was going on, but my aunt and uncle took her out of the room. My mom and my other aunt got all the other kids to quiet down and go to bed. So I went back to my game and eventually fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning I find out that the cousin that was screaming had been trying to get my attention because she needed to pee, but was too afraid to use my bathroom because someone had turned off the light that was supposed to be left on for them. She saw that I was awake and was trying to ask me for help. When I didn't answer her she tried climbing up the ladder to my bed. She fell and ended up dislocating her arm.\n\nEveryone wanted to know what happened and why I didn't help her. I said I didn't hear her because of my headphones. Everyone started ganging up on me saying I should have known better than to wear noise canceling headphones since I baby sit. My uncle is the most angry and said that I need to learn to use my fucking head. But I babysit older kids and no one even said I was babysitting so I don't think it's fair for them to say it's my fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I told my dad about them all blaming me when he got home and he told them it wasn't my fault or responsibility. We went out and had dinner just us.

No one discussed the concept of you babysitting said children, so there's no reason to expect you to have taken any special level of responsibility for said children. You are in your own room, living your life as close to normally as you can in the situation.\n\nIt's unreasonable of them to have expected you to just fully think about any possible implications and assume responsibility for other people in general. But you sound like you're a teenager, ergo still a kid yourself, and it's even less understandable to assume another child would just innately assume responsibility over everyone else in the room without a discussion about it. And there's no valid reason why you shouldn't be able to listen to stuff on your headphones like you normally would \\_UNLESS\\_ you had explicitly been asked to, and then agreed to, act as a semi-sitter for those kids.\n\n100% not on you. It's an unfortunate accident, and I'd suggest the only reason anyone is even blaming you at all is that it's really natural to look to blame someone/something when an accident happens. It's not the girl's fault she was scared or trying to get your attention, it's not gravity's fault for pulling stuff down, so by process of elimination this means it has to somehow be your fault. Except it's not, and that's all just a string of fallacious thinking. This isn't anyone's fault, it's a freakin accident", "**NTA -** I\u2019m really sorry to hear that the blame for this is being placed on you, it must be weighing very heavy on your conscience, but in my opinion, I don\u2019t think you are to blame at all.   \nI think you are well within your right to have your own little space while you share your room, I think nearly every person on earth would put on headphones at night in that situation, including the people who are blaming you for it. Who\u2019s the person who turned off the light the kids were supposed to have on? No one\u2019s blaming them no? Plus people can\u2019t just bounce responsibility of their kids off onto somebody else without even explicitly asking first. It\u2019s not like your were asked and given instructions on precautions to take with the kids. \n\nsucks what happened to the little one but at the end of the day shit happens, kids get hurt and like my granny always said \u201cit\u2019ll be gone before their wedding day.\u201d", "NTA.

You weren\u2019t babysitting, you were being forced to share space. The best thing would have been for the kids to stay with their parents regardless.

They didn't want to deal with little tantrums or find a damn flashlight or nightlight for the kids to sleep with their parents, that's on them. It is sorry that someone got hurt, but in absolutely no way was it your fault. That kid couldn't go pee because big scary dark bathroom but not big scary ladder? Kinda odd but sure. Kids are weird.

Especially with an upcoming funeral where I assume being the young ones usually comes with pole barring duty at funerals. It was an accident these things happen and honestly if little one was that scared at night she should have been staying with mom and dad. Sounds like tensions are also high since it's also a funeral everyone is here for, and a dislocated arm now isn't helping the stress. Uncle needs to chill but I assume it's his daughter so he's frustrated (again should have made her stay with you (dad) bucko).
