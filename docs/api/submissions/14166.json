No one discussed the concept of you babysitting said children, so there's no reason to expect you to have taken any special level of responsibility for said children. You are in your own room, living your life as close to normally as you can in the situation.\n\nIt's unreasonable of them to have expected you to just fully think about any possible implications and assume responsibility for other people in general. But you sound like you're a teenager, ergo still a kid yourself, and it's even less understandable to assume another child would just innately assume responsibility over everyone else in the room without a discussion about it. And there's no valid reason why you shouldn't be able to listen to stuff on your headphones like you normally would \\_UNLESS\\_ you had explicitly been asked to, and then agreed to, act as a semi-sitter for those kids.\n\n100% not on you. It's an unfortunate accident, and I'd suggest the only reason anyone is even blaming you at all is that it's really natural to look to blame someone/something when an accident happens. It's not the girl's fault she was scared or trying to get your attention, it's not gravity's fault for pulling stuff down, so by process of elimination this means it has to somehow be your fault. Except it's not, and that's all just a string of fallacious thinking. This isn't anyone's fault, it's a freakin accident", "**NTA -** I\u2019m really sorry to hear that the blame for this is being placed on you, it must be weighing very heavy on your conscience, but in my opinion, I don\u2019t think you are to blame at all.   \nI think you are well within your right to have your own little space while you share your room, I think nearly every person on earth would put on headphones at night in that situation, including the people who are blaming you for it. Who\u2019s the person who turned off the light the kids were supposed to have on? No one\u2019s blaming them no? Plus people can\u2019t just bounce responsibility of their kids off onto somebody else without even explicitly asking first. It\u2019s not like your were asked and given instructions on precautions to take with the kids. \n\nsucks what happened to the little one but at the end of the day shit happens, kids get hurt and like my granny always said \u201cit\u2019ll be gone before their wedding day.\u201d", "NTA. You weren\u2019t \u201cbabysitting\u201d. Relatives dumped their kids in your room and expected you to take care of them. It was just an accident anyway. If they want to point fingers, they can go home and take responsibility for their own kids\u2026Also if you are supposed to be babysitting tell your uncle what your rates are and double them since they have you on duty overnight.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t babysitting, you were being forced to share space. The best thing would have been for the kids to stay with their parents regardless. They have no one to blame but themselves for what happened as did they just expect you to sit and do nothing all night.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility considering you weren\u2019t told to babysit and I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t even think about such a thing happening. They\u2019re lucky you\u2019re even cool with sharing your room in the first place. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re to blame and they should have calmly had a conversation with you after the fact to ask you not to wear them again instead of ganging up on you.", "NTA.   You weren\u2019t babysitting and the kids are the responsibility of their parents.  I feel bad for your cousin but it was an accident.  If they wanted you to babysit that should have been made clear.  There were other adults in the home who should have burn listening for their kids.", "NTA\n\nWhoever switched off the light and didn't make sure there was a nightlight there.\n\nYou weren't told you needed to be there to supervise and you were being polite by wearing your headphones.\nHowever next time (if there is a next time) maybe you should ask for a torch in your room as a backup for the littles incase the light issue happens again.", "NTA. You are right and should let them know you were NOT the babysitter. If the kids need that much assistance at night, then they should be with their parents.", "This was a random accident. They are giant AH for trying to guilt you. You were not on babysitting duty when it happened and could not be expected to be listening as you were not in charge of the kids. NTA.", "Nta\n\nYou weren't babysitting them though, they were sleeping in your room, that's all. If they needed to be watched all night they should have been in a different room.", "NTA why the f can't this \"aunt\" and this \"uncle\" let them sleep in their own room.\n\nWhat's their responsibility? They too lazy to fkin care about their own kids? It's not your responsibility, they forced you into this, they didn't give a heck about your opinion.\n\nThe real idiots here was who the heck turned off the bathroom light and who the heck didn't tell you these kids had issues with the dark.\n\nIt's not fair to you buddy, don't worry.", "NTA\n\nFuck that noise, they can care for their own kids.", "NTA. These kids weren't your responsibility, they were their parents'.  And we all know damn well they dumped the kids in your room so they wouldn't have to deal with them.", "NTA. Family can be for sure. They are most likely upset with the events that gathered them and this unfortunate accident could've made them tip over the edge. If nobody stated you were supposed to be looking after these kids while they slept in *your* room, then it's on them to make sure the children are safe and sound. They didn't want to deal with little tantrums or find a damn flashlight or nightlight for the kids to sleep with their parents, that's on them. It is sorry that someone got hurt, but in absolutely no way was it your fault. That kid couldn't go pee because big scary dark bathroom but not big scary ladder? Kinda odd but sure. Kids are weird. Everyone needs to calm down a bit, think about what was said, and prepare better for next time. I hope someone steps up for you. This is the most I can do.", "NTA. You were never asked to babysit. They can put this on you. If these Children are so young that going to the bathroom in an unfamiliar house scares them, they should be staying in the room with their parents.", "NTA... I wouldn't let them stay at my home any longer...your home and you did use your head by having headphones in", "NTA.\n\nYou were not asked to babysit them. They were not your responsibility.", "I wonder how old this kid is that she couldn't figure out how to use the bathroom in the dark.\n\nIf you hadn't been playing games with headphones, you'd have been asleep, and the kid still would have climbed up to get you.", "NTA. If you have a kid who can\u2019t turn on a light and / or pee alone you keep them within reach / hearing distance, especially in someone else\u2019s home.  NTA at all. I would still say this if it was my own kid hurt.", "NTA They are not your responsibility. They have two parents and you aren't one of them. It's unfortunate that someone was injured, but you were sleeping, not babysitting.", "Completely not your fault. Family sucks bro! Dont feel guilty at all", "NTA\n\nIf you were supposed to \"mind\" them, someone should've mentioned it to you.", "NAH. \n\nYou weren't aware that you were supposed to be \"babysitting\" your cousins, no one told you that. So you did what any teenager would do, put on headphones and did your own thing. \n\nIt super sucks that your cousin hurt themselves trying to get your attention, but that could have happened anyway, the world is random.", "NTA. Parents need to stop expecting free childcare from others. Not my circus. Not my monkey.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t babysitting. It\u2019s not your responsibility.

It's the neglectful parents fault. It's because of their own selfish reasons they have a hurt child.

You didn't hear an emergency in your own room.", "NAH, I get you wanting to wear headphones. But I find it odd that your tone is so cold regarding your cousin being hurt. The family shouldn\u2019t be blaming you, accidents happen. But, Your aunt and uncle are probably stressed anyway. (You said people are in town for a funeral, not usually a relaxing event).

Especially with an upcoming funeral where I assume being the young ones usually comes with pole barring duty at funerals. It was an accident these things happen and honestly if little one was that scared at night she should have been staying with mom and dad. Sounds like tensions are also high since it's also a funeral everyone is here for, and a dislocated arm now isn't helping the stress. Uncle needs to chill but I assume it's his daughter so he's frustrated (again should have made her stay with you (dad) bucko). This will pass, just give a general I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was on babysitting duty honestly, just to get this dumb drama over with. But you aren't in the wrong or an asshole.", "NTA, you were not being paid to babysit them. The parents are responsible for their own children.", "NTA\n\nThe kids all should have been placed on air mattresses with their own parents. It is ridiculous to expect that you would supervise five children who are not yours. It was their parents' job to supervise their own children, not yours.", "NTA. If the kids are so young/scared of hallways and doors and the dark, they should have been with their parents. Shame on them. They are blaming you because they were being bad parents. It's truly ironic that your uncle said you should have used your head when he clearly didn't use his.", "NTA. This is so not your fault, and it\u2019s crappy that the adults in your family are placing the blame on you.

Maybe a hotel would have been better for their needs.", "I'd blame the parents. Why can't they squeeze their kids into their rooms.
