{"id": 19634, "submission_id": "1499bkl", "title": "AITA for lying at my friend and not forgiving her?", "selftext": "English isn't my first language so there might be some grammar errors LOL\n\nI(14f) have a crush on a guy from another class(let's call him S). Only some close friends knew about this. My friend G also knew about it, but I later realized she wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She always teased me and said stuff like '[my name] likes [half my crush's name]!', but I took it with humor. However I told her to be more careful in public 'cause I didn't want it to be known by everyone. She always said okay, but nope, nothing changed.\n\nSo yesterday I decided to lie to her saying I didn't like him anymore. I knew this wasn't morally right, but I thought that if this didn't get over, both my crush and I wouldn't have a good time dealing with all the unnecessary rumors. If I 'didn't crush on him anymore' she'd get tired of teasing me. \n\nThe problem is that it didn't go as expected. When I told her I didn't like him anymore. I referred\nto him just as 'him' and I said it in a normal-quiet voice(actually some kids there knew about me having a crush, but they didn't have a clue who he was). Then G goes \"[my name] LIKES S(full name)!!!!\" \"ALSO SHE WAS REJECTED!!!!\". I tell her to stop, seriously, but she ignores me and just goes on. We were in the classroom, and random kids walked by. Then break time ended and we went back to our seats. I was visibly pissed off, so she says she is 'so sorry' and to 'cheer up', with a peppy smile. I later told her I was mad at her, and that I wanted a sincere apology(I was a little harsh here, but I tried to be calm and didn't swear or scream at her). Nope, she just said a bunch of her smiley Don't be so saltys and said that nobody knew who my crush was, just the two girls 'she was directing to'(who I didn't want them to know). However a guy from our class heard and reacted to us when G did what she did, and another friend said she and a bunch of other girls completely got to know my crush's identity; so I didn't believe G's words.\n\nToday she acted distant and according to several close friends of mine, she said she didn't know what my 'fucking problem' was, and that if I wasn't 'taking her apologies' she'd 'cut me off'. I think I might have overreacted. AITA? By the way, it is true I got left on read once by S, but I didn't get officially rejected, so I'm not agreeing with G in this.", "created_utc": 1686752915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1499bkl/aita_for_lying_at_my_friend_and_not_forgiving_her/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
