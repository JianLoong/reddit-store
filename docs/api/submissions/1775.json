My mom and I have a rough past. Without spilling out my entire life sob story, living with her wasn\u2019t awesome so I went to college, I never moved back home. When I was on my own and no longer dependent on her financially, our relationship improved. We\u2019d occasionally grab drinks, go grocery shopping or swimming. However due to some of the cruel behaviors I\u2019ve seen from her in the past, I always tried to keep her at an arms length because whenever things were going really well with her she\u2019d do something awful like make me cry at my birthday dinner, make comments about my weight, hold things out of my control over my head etc. \n\nSo flash forward I\u2019m shopping for my wedding dress. I invite her, my therapist and family suggested I try to include her in more things so she doesn\u2019t feel excluded and lash out. Well, she gets COVID, can\u2019t make it, but I FaceTime her the whole time. I find a dress I love, but notice my mom is upset she missed it. I make a second appointment at a different shop so she feels included and so I can make sure we have that moment to remember together. I\u2019m also trying to maintain boundaries, so I ask that we take separate cars because she has a history of waiting till stuck I\u2019m in a moving vehicle with her to start fights. Somethings change and I need to drive my cousin and my grandma to the appointment as well, I call and text my mom that she can meet me at my house if she\u2019d like to carpool. My mom is upset, she does not like when plans change or she feels left out. She ignores my texts and calls, she drives herself (for context I gave her 2 hours notice, she lives 10 minutes away). My mom is 20 minutes late to my hour long appointment that I scheduled 4 weeks in advance. When I get out of the dressing room in my first dress, she is on her phone and doesn\u2019t even look up at me. I\u2019m fuming. This whole appointment is so she can feel included, and I more than anything want her approval and want us to stop fighting. Like word vomit I say \u201cthanks for showing up\u201d, she starts screaming at me that it\u2019s my fault she\u2019s late because I didn\u2019t pick her up. I tell her \u201care you fucking kidding me I offered\u201d. I\u2019m so embarrassed I go back in the changing room. When I come out again she\u2019s taking pictures of the decor of the store. Makes it clear she doesn\u2019t care about my dresses. I ask her opinion, she ignores me. I ask if she wants to help pick a dress out with me, she says no. She leaves without saying goodbye. We haven\u2019t spoken since. I\u2019m not even sure I want her involved in the wedding planning anymore.
