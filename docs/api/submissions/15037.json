If he really cares that much Google Translate is a thing.", "Oh good grief...he can copy and paste onto Google Translate!  NTA.  Stay away from that drama.  It's nice that you want to be a good friend and I wholeheartedly support that, but for sure keep out of that as much as possible!  He is just hung up on a girl who probably dumped him.  Remind him of the reasons they separated and ask what's changed that will make the relationship work in the future?  She won't change.  He needs to block everything.  Yikes.", "NTA. It won\u2019t make a difference, but you set a reasonable boundary. He can just go to Google translate. He\u2019s going to be sore with you though. You\u2019re going the high conflict route here. But it seems like that is who you are. And to translate her TikTok\u2018s would violate something in your spirit. So keep on keeping on. But be generous and understanding with your roommate. Love is not rational. Have you ever fallen for someone less than ideal? NTA", "NTA- there's literally a \"see translation\" button that comes up when posts are captions in other languages.... he doesn't need you to translate", "NTA - and congratulations for staying out of someone else's relationship. \n\nAlso, has this person not heard of google?

Once a second has passed you can never get it back.  It\u2019s gone forever and I can instantly understand why you don\u2019t want to devote any of your time or energy to the girl", "NTA. It's best for you to maintain your distance and not get caught up in their drama. GOod for you.", "NTA.

You\u2019ve already set a boundary with him about not liking it when he talks about her and he\u2019s overstepped that mark today. Good for you for not enabling his whack behaviour!", "NTA. It's good you aren't enabling him pining over her. If she's toxic, he needs to let it go.", "NTA.\n\nIf he is really interested in this girl - who speaks spanish - he should learn it.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to participate in his social media stalking.

It's not like you are trying to get this girl for yourself or you don't want to see him happy.\n\nHe could use Google translate or something... it's not like you are the only translation option in the world.", "NTA. I think it's perfectly fine for you to lay down a boundary that you don't want to be part of their relationship, regardless of what stage it's at (like right now it's in the creepy she ended it and he's stalking her social media stage). You could even be firm and tell him you don't want to hear about her anymore (but also don't interject your opinions because he's an adult and will do him). But you absolutely are not obligated to help him stalk her social media and translate for him. He can use google translate, or.. like you said, stop being creepy.", "Nta. You have his best interests at heart and you're right that it's not particularly healthy for him to be stalking her social media like this \n\n(Also he's very capable of googling a translation if he's that bothered)", "NTA for not translating, but if you truly care about your friend, your best bet is to stop being judgmental start being fully supportive. Not that you have to lie about your feelings or anything, but focus on being someone they can continue to talk to. That means not alienating them and making them feel like they can talk to you. Isolation is a classic abuse tactic, and friends/family often accidentally help that along by constantly voicing their (reasonable) concerns and even setting boundaries, (similar to what you did here.) It\u2019s definitely not easy, especially when all you can see are screaming red flags, but it might make all the difference if they ever get in over their head and you\u2019re the only one they can turn to.", "Why is he not just using online translators?", "Oh yeah, I totally have. And he was there for me during that time. He was in fact the one to find out and let me know that she was cheating on me.

That\u2019s the line I\u2019m trying to toe. I\u2019ll talk with him later about this to let him know I\u2019ll be there for him in a serious capacity because I do want to continue to fill that role for him", "He probably did after our conversation, but he was used to asking me because I would do it while they were together.
