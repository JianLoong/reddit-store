{"id": 27277, "submission_id": "16nplui", "title": "WIBTAH for telling my husband the real reason I got myself a birthday gift was because he didn't get me one?", "selftext": "I just celebrated my birthday a few weeks ago, and my husband celebrated by getting me cake, flowers  a card and surprise visits from my family. I was grateful, but I would've loved for him to ask me what gift I wanted for my birthday, or gotten me something off of my wishlist. He knows I love jewelry. For Christmas last year he got me a perfume and boots. It's really only on birthdays he slacks off because this is the second birthday he gets me just that. I know birthdays are important to him because he was super touched when he saw his birthday set up and told me what he wanted as a gift. So it's simple. He knows birthdays are important and a great time to give gifts. \n\nI've been needing a new water bottle but he said he went and didn't find any. And I guess he opted out of a gift entirely. Kinda messed up considering I asked him what he wanted for his birthday, and got him one of what he said he needed, tix to a movie he's been wanting to see, on top of a birthday cake and card. \n\nI went to the store to find a water bottle myself and I ended up finding a beautiful pair of shoes at an extremely discounted price. I already have a pair but they're super cheap and low quality, and thus super uncomfortable. I couldn't find anything better so I settled for them. Also I'm not super in love with them. My husband didn't know this but I would have told him had he asked. Also he was there with me when I bought them and he knows they're cheap.\n\nI knew I'd miss out if I didn't get them so I brought them home and told him I got myself a birthday present. When he asked why I said \"because if I didn't get them I'll never see them again!\" What I really wanted to say was: \"had you asked me I would've said I wanted a nice comfy pair of slip ons!\" He then told me I should be saving money, but that if they make me happy it's fine. Lol. I do save money for the record. And we are in no way struggling. We split all of our bills. \n\nFor those who I know will ask: I didn't feel comfortable asking him to get me a birthday gift because I honestly thought that a first year of husband and wife he would get me a gift. It's my fault for assuming this but it makes no sense. It makes me feel like he isn't generous, he gives the absolute bare minimum and wants me to just be happy with that. And I can't be. I don't know how to be. I go above and beyond for him. Why can't he do the same?!\n\nEdit: we are not saving money for anything in specific. He just meant we should be saving our money as in putting it into savings. Well I just sent $2,200 into my savings last wk and I never buy treat myself to ANYTHING but takeout so I told him to put a sock in it. (Not literally obviously but that's what I wanted to say)\n\nEdit: The shoes were $34 in case you were wondering.\n\nINFO: For his birthday last year I got him the cologne of his dreams, and a trip to a nice spa, and cake. For Christmas I got him a pair of long sleeve shirts from his favorite brand. \nFor his birthday this year, I got him a nice pack of boxers (because his were super old and worn out and he specifically said he wanted them!!!!) and movie tickets along with a cake and decorations.\n\nEdit: he had options besides a water bottle. He could've bought me panties as well, which I also need, which he knows because he's reminded me to purchase them myself. lol. He knows what I have and what I don't. He knows every item in my closet and what I like and what I don't. I have one pair of mom jeans, he knows I'd love another pair. I could go on. There's no reason to just not get anything. \n\nEdit: I don't consider the celebration a gift. It's super sweet but I just don't consider it a gift. I got him a celebration on TOP of a gift. That's just normal birthday stuff to me.\n\nEdit: I just realized that he gifted me something he values. Time with family. He doesn't have his family nearby and I know he would've wanted to spend time with them. I do value family time but not as much as him, so thought this IS sentimental, I think he was thinking more of what he'd like for his birthday. \n\nMore info: for those asking my family lives nearby, they don't have to fly out to see me.

I probably have over 15 most of which are private and categorized for specific things like 1 for clothes, 1 for kitchen supplies, etc. But I made 1 public and I gave family members the link and a few times a year I just add things to it. Sometimes when I'm watching my shows I'll move things to it from my other wishlists to update it if I buy things on the public wishlists for myself.\n\nAnd before internet gangsters come for me saying I'm entitled, it started a few years back with my parents not knowing what to get me for Christmas and it worked so well we all started doing it and just kept it up. \n\nSo now the people close to me who would be inclined to buy me gifts never have to wonder what I want because they can just look at the list whenever they want. It works for them because it makes it easy and convenient for them to buy gifts for me and it works for me because everything on the list is something I want. \n\nI make sure to keep things on the list at a variety of prices so I'm not asking people to buy things for me that they cannot afford. I was delighted to get a $5 pack of Avatar the Last Airbender stickers to decorate my laptop case with. \n\nIf you don't want to use Amazon, I coordinated a gift exchange with some close friends years ago using the website Elfster. When you create your profile you can add your birthday and it will send out email reminders to your friends close to your birthday. Also it's nice since Amazon made it so you can't really add items outside of Amazon to an Amazon wishlist so you can add items from different websites to your elfster wishlist. \n\nA practical system like this after talking to your husband about how important gift-giving is to you and how it's a primary love language can probably solve this issue in the future.", "NTA if you don't communicate that you feel like he is dropping the ball after you put in so much effort for him, it won't get better.", "Get a lawyer, a gun, and get divorced now, this guy does not give a single fook", "NTA It's a good idea to tell him because otherwise it will make you feel bad every year.   \nHowever, instead of concentrating on his qualities, like him not being generous (That's more likely to get him to point out other times he's been generous.)

No biggie.\nThree second year he actually organized a party for me and gave me money.\nLast year we went out for the day but he never got me a birthday gift. The next day I ordered myself the helmet I really wanted and had pointed out to him. He casualty said he could pay for that since he didn't get me anything.

I think you need to have a conversation about your differences in love languages here, and maybe take the love language test together and share results. It sounds like he went for \"quality time\" being his gift to you, but for you, a gift is a tangible item.

I've been married for almost 24 years, and I would always have to remind my husband about my birthday. He would tell me he was trying to plan this or get me that, but he never followed through. He also believes that he shouldn't have to wait for a special day to get me a present. And if I see something I want as long as we can afford it, I should just get it. So that's what we do. He gets me things whenever he sees something I would like. We pick a day during birthday months to go out and do stuff to celebrate our special day. \n\nSo I say you guys need to communicate what you all need from each other. Be honest, but not spiteful or angry.", "YTA for expecting people to read your mind. Can't understand people that go into marriage without having proper communication skills towards each other. Probably one of the reasons why divorce rate is so high", "Being he is your husband, this should not have been an issue in the first place. These things should be figured out before marriage.

It sounds like he celebrated your birthday in a thoughtful way but not in a way you felt special - which again, perfectly fine but needs to be communicated. Successful relationships are realizing that other people don\u2019t know what you want and express love in different ways. \n\nShould he have asked if you wanted a gift? Sure, also reasonable but you\u2019re acting like he totally forgot your birthday. Approach the situation assuming he had good intentions and I thinj you both will get what you want from the conversation and from birthdays moving forward instead of being passive aggressive and resentful.", "OP........since I haven't seen anyone else ask you flat out, I will......\n\nYou said your husband surprised you with your family visit. Does your family live nearby or did they have to travel to visit you? Did you husband pay or help pay for their visit?

You said he bought you jewelry for Christmas. Why repeat the same gift?

If you don\u2019t even know how each other like to give and receive love, why are you married?!

You got him movie tickets and a cake, but expected jewelry? He tried to find you a good water bottle, but didn\u2019t find one he thought you\u2019d like.

That's what would make it seem more passive aggressive and less just informative.

And even when both are good at paying attention to subtle hints and non-verbal cues, clear direct communication always works better.\n\nFor example, he got you a cake, flowers, a card and family visits. You are posting because you wanted a gift. But there are a lot of other questions that could be hidden in there.\n\nDid you want a gift instead of those other things? In addition to them? If it has to be some, but not all, what are the priorities? Does it have to be those specific things, or can some be swapped out for other stuff, like a dinner at a special restaurant instead of the cake? What if he thought of a special trip, where does that rate?\n\nCan he figure this stuff out from subtle hints and clues? Maybe, yes...\n\nBut look at it this way. Your birthday comes once a year. It could take years of trial and error for him to learn your priorities. Why deal with years of that when a simple conversation can cut through a lot of fumbling and guessing games?\n\nJust communicating so that he knows what you want could solve a lot of this.
