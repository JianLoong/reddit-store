Now he is suffering those consequences. Sounds like a good life lesson to me. He could try some new foods if he is taking a bite of your food, but he needs to order what he is willing to eat.", "Just to clarify. You told him that acting a specific way will result in specific consequences and the when he acted in that specific way you followed through on said consequences. NTA. You can either deal with these tantrums now or when he's 20. I think now will be easier.", "You and your wife have two choices here: \n\n1. Teach your son this perfectly age-appropriate lesson that he is responsible for his own choices\n2. Let him grow up to be an entitled asshat who believes that other people are responsible for his choices\n\nYou're not an AH but if your wife keeps choosing #2, your son will grow up to be one. Don't let her do that to him.", "NTA. 12 is old enough to be able to pick off a menu and to know what foods he likes/ dislikes. You\u2019re right not to swap, giving in and letting him have your food all of the time would set a terrible precedent going forward. It\u2019s a harmless lesson, especially given that he\u2019s given the opportunity to eat what he likes at home", "At 12, you son is old enough to be responsible to remember what he likes or does not like.  So if he orders something gross, he can choke it down or go without.\n\nAre not NTA.", "NTA. Why didn't your wife offer him her meal? And she calls you a \"huge jerk\" - what does that make her?\n\nYour son FA, then he FO, and he still got fed in the end. Maybe he'll learn from this.", "INFO: what is his goal with this? Does he actually think he'll like it? Does he do it to get attention? Does he do it because he has an innate desire to try new things and have new experiences?\n\nI feel like that should really inform your approach here. You aren't TA for telling him he can't have your food. It's clearly a pattern, it's wasteful, and you're rightfully annoyed. \n\nBut I'm wondering if he just really wants to expand his palette and find out and try new things...maybe you can make it a family affair. Pick one occasion a month where you order something new and crazy off of a menu for the entire table to try. Have him order a safe food as his main dish, but have the new dish as an option, too. That way you can all participate, but it isn't as wasteful or annoying. And if he's doing it for attention, that will slowly go away with this approach, too.", "Just wait when he turns 21 and he wants to swap drinks with you because he got a mule or a gin and tonic.  I\u2019m speaking from experience here.  \n\nDefinitely NTA.  We all have only so many of the same mistakes in us.  It was time for your boy to learn.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is an enabler. She can give him her food next time.", "Tell your son if he doesn't like what he orders he can eat mom's food.\n\nIt seems to me that by 12 he knows this is a jerk move.\nAnd by 12 he should be developing some concepts about money. If he doesn't, his life is gonna be rough.\n\n.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis is a lesson he is going to need to learn, could you imagine he takes his first serious GF out to dinner and then wants to eat her meal because he ordered something he does not like.\n\nI come from an era when what you got for a meal was what you got. There was no menu no alterative. You ate or you went hungry.\n\nWe didn't go out for meals and the only take away was fish and chips.\n\nIn the 1970's in my family there was no room for picky eaters.", "NTA And if your wife is so cool with the behavior, inform her that she can be the one to give your soon her food from now on. He\u2019s 12, he should definitely understand the concept of consequences for choices by now. I\u2019m a picky eater & order things I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll like. I\u2019m not sharing with anyone lol", "INFO: is he ordering the same things that he doesn't like every time, or is it always something pretty different from the last time? Trying out new things isn't bad and probably should be accommodated to some extent (and it'll eventually go away as he discovers what he likes), but if he's intentionally ordering things he knows he doesn't like, there's a different kind of problem and the consequence is definitely the right one.", "NTA because you warned him beforehand and he was able to make a sandwich when he got home.  It is good that is an adventurous eater - maybe encourage him to get new foods as appetizers.", "NTA but you're probably going to want to figure out why he's doing that.", "NTA at all. It's completely wrong to keep wasting food and money. This is a valuable lesson for him, and hopefully, he will learn from it.", "NTA. Looks like he doesn\u2019t get to order for himself anymore. Wasting food and money is not cute.", "The way he made food for himself when he got home makes me feel like NTA where your wife might be TA for hoisting the consequences onto you when son is perfectly aware he has food at home and is capable of getting it on his own.\n\nDinner out is a treat, if he wants to use it to try something new that's ok or if he wants something he knows he likes that's ok too... But either way he is responsible for his choice this way", "NTA. I'm a picky eater, and when I want to try new things, I'll ask my gf to split meals. You need to agree ahead of time, or both of you are only getting half meals, or you always get sick eating a meal you don't want. Teach your kid to be more independent, if he orders it, that's his order, end of story.", "NTA. At that age, he needs to learn.", "NTA. Natural consequences are a great teacher. My son tried this on me and I told him his choice is his choice, and he was 9. He then kept adventure ordering thinking I would bend.... Nope. The result; he now has the most varied food pallet and was a sushi freak by age 11 and eats stuff by 15 that even old gritty Asian guys won't eat. The other side to holding your position here is that he will be much better off later on life because he will actually try things. \n\nParenting is tough, you are making a better person of your son by holding him able.\n\nGood job", "So I have a kid who is kind of like this. He's generally adventurous but sometimes steps into territory that doesn't work out for him. He also has some texture/taste issues that are a result of neurodivergence.\n\nI think there is a balance to strike with this stuff because being too harsh about it makes kids retreat into safe territory and it can actually exacerbate the problem by making them more picky. I want my kid to try new things always and not feel that he's fully stuck if it doesn't work out. I don't want him to think that picking the wrong thing would be a meal-ending choice for him because it discourages trying new things.\n\nThe trick I've learned is to add \"safe\" items to the order. That is, get a side they will always eat and order a smaller amount of the main item. So if my kid wanted fish soup, I'd opt for a cup over a bowl, then order some rice or fries on the side (stuff he'll eat 100 percent of the time). That way, he still has something to eat and while it's not ideal, it's something. I'm not going to give him my food or order something different, but he's safe knowing that he won't go hungry.", "NTA - my 10 yo will do this, but we let her sit there and eventually it stopped.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that he wants to try new things, but if he\u2019s consistently ordering new things and then not eating them, it\u2019s unfair that you have to give up your meal. Have you considered letting him order something new but small alongside something he\u2019ll actually eat? Then everyone could try something new, but there\u2019s still a meal he\u2019ll actually eat.", "NTA. At 12 he needs to be held accountable. I don't know how vehemently you expressed it and if that was the problem with your wife.", "NTA. But stop letting him order things he won\u2019t eat. He can be adventurous when he\u2019s spending his money.", "NTA. People who think consequences for actions are tantamount to abuse are bad parents. By twelve you should probably have worked out cause and effect.", "This is a repeat from a week or so ago.", "NTA- He's old enough to understand the deal. And the deal seems to be him and his mommy pressuring daddy into a consequence free life. He will likely try this again since Mommy is on his side. I would inform if he wants to act like a spoiled Mommy's boy he can ask to swap with her. Dad is no longer playing along", "NTA he needs to learn to not waste food and money. Also be considerate of others. Why should his father have less when he chose to order something he didn\u2019t like. Let him learn his lesson so he knows better next time", "NTA and it is time to sit down with your son and offer him an alternative - if he wants to try to be adventurous, rather than ruin everyone else's dinner by demanding someone trade with him, tell him to learn how to make exotic dishes at home. It isn't that hard to find recipes, shop for the ingredients and spend an afternoon making the dish. He wants to try things (kudos) but doesn't have a sophisticated enough palette to foresee taste, texture and how they intersect with his likes and dislikes.", "NTA let him have the natural consequences of his actions. If it happens enough times he\u2019ll learn to stop ordering food he won\u2019t eat. He can eat at home so he\u2019s not starved and if he is always getting his way you are teaching him to be entitled to other peoples things!", "Your kid definitely needs to learn that choices/decisions have consequences. If he wants to be adventurous that\u2019s great, imo, because not enough people are adventurous with their food choices. However, that doesn\u2019t mean suddenly you (or anyone else) should suffer if he doesn\u2019t like what he ordered. That\u2019s the risk you take when you order new things.\n\nNTA and your wife needs to treat your kid like an adult if she\u2019s going to let him make choices like an adult.", "NTA. If he can't be counted on to order food he'll eat, order for him. You're still the parent!", "NTA. Your son eventually made the wise choice of making himself a sandwich over starving. Your wife is not teaching your son to think before he makes decisions he will have to live with.\n\nVery soon your son will be eating in restaurants on his own occasionally, and the stranger at the next table might not be so willing to swap meals with him.  LOL", "NTA.\nFirst of all, your son is 12. He's old enough to know his palate, and if he still wants to experiment, he's also old enough to wait until he gets home to eat a sandwich. \n\n>This resulted in an argument with my wife. She thinks I am a huge jerk and I am sick of never getting to eat what I order.\n\nIf your wife thinks your son should have someone elses food, she can give your son *her own* plate. Problem fixed.", "NTA, but maybe he is doing this out of other reasons like wanting your attention for his things.\n  \nMaybe he enjoys how you share your food with him.", "NTA", "Nta - but I suspect there\u2019s something else going on here. Have you asked him why he does that?", "NTA.  I was raised on \"order what you want,  but eat what you get\". If he wants to be adventurous,  more power to him,  but he needs to learn to eat what he gets.", "With my daughter we learned to \u201cconsult\u201d on menu choices, she would ask and I would let her know if I thought she would or would not like it. Then the decision was on her.\n\nNTA you made it clear that you were no longer willing to give the meal you chose for their mistake", "Why didn't you stop him when he ordered the fish soup? It's clear he doesn't have a very adventurous palette (which it seems he got from you) so you could've encouraged him to order something more basic like your chicken.\n\nNTA", "NTA, he needs to eat what he ordered or not eat anything else. Keep telling him he needs to accept what he ordered and push through it like the big boy you know he is. You had only one sip of it, keep going, you might end up liking it in the end. And eat your chicken.  \n\n\nI would tell him that anything you order you need to finish it, regardless of how it feels to your tongue or tastebuds. You ordered it, you eat it.", "NTA, but next time? Let him order first and then order the exact same thing ;)", "NTA - \n\nHe's old enough to know better, and I see this as a power play in a game called \"Let's Make Daddy Go Hungry\".  Does he ever ask for mom's food?\n\nOrder what you want, eat what you order ... it's a real simple rule.", "NAH\n\nMostly because I\u2019m not gonna call a kid an AH for trying new foods and finding out he doesn\u2019t like it. \n\nHave you ever asked him about this? Like what\u2019s his thought process, does it sound good on the menu and then he doesn\u2019t like it? Is it a \u201cgrass is greener\u201d thing? Do you return food you don\u2019t like - is he modelling behaviour?", "NTA , your kid is 12 and old enough to know better, he\u2019s probably TA to be honest", "NTA, your son needs to start being responsable for his own choices, at 12 he is old enough to know what he likes so he needs to order food he know he will be able to eat...", "NTA\n\nI swear this is a repost from a few weeks ago.", "NTA\n\nYour son is free to order the food he wants, and if he doesn't like it, maybe the waitress will swap it out, if not, he is stuck.  Why would eating your food even be an option?  If he wants chicken, he needs to get chicken.", "NTA I have a weird thing about texture and I got away with eating what I want. I'm a picky eater for sure but I hate waste. My partner eats everything. I order what I know I like and will eat and try his food. If I like it I order it next time. If cooking food I try it if I don't like it he freezes leftovers and cook for myself.", "NTA natural consequences. If you are hungry you will eat and the option will still be here in the middle of the night if you decide you are hungry.", "NTA. I'd stop taking him out.

Make him use allowance money to buy his crazy food choice if he doesn\u2019t eat it", "Personally I think your son should be encouraged to expand his food choices. Many people on the spectrum have aversion to certain textures. Perhaps your son thought he may like fish in a different form ie the soup as apposed to a baked or fried fillet. \nPerhaps strike a deal that he can still try and expand his pallet but if the food isn't palpable to him he will eat a prepackaged snack/small meal to eat until you get home instead of requesting your food.", "NTA: You eat what you ordered.

It's reasonable to expect him to eat the meal he himself has chosen or eat when he gets home, but it's a good idea to put some restrictions on what he can order. He can choose something he's tried before and was able to tolerate.  If mom got the fish soup last time and he tried and liked it, he can order it today.  But if he's never had cioppino or the salmon chowder before he can't order a full serving of it this time.  Side dish, perhaps, but not his main course.

It's my experience that people make better decisions when they actually have some skin in the game, and having him literally pay the cost of an irresponsible choice teaches a pretty useful lesson.

I used to do this in the past but stopped as my partner didn\u2019t really like it. His dad does this and it drives my mil crazy. (Watching this go down is why I realized I shouldn\u2019t do it to my partner.)", "I was thinking the same thing! An adventurous appetizer, with a meal he will eat.", "I agree, it\u2019s pretty clear that the child is spoiled by his mother at the very least. At 12 years old he should be fully able to comprehend this. The problem is that they\u2019ve given in too many times already. Shit should have been cut the first few times it happened.", "Next time the kid orders something that he actually enjoys, Dad should insist on swapping because he doesn't like what he ordered.", "Sounds like a control/autonomy issue. \n\nHe might be picking these adventurous foods because he's testing the limits of self-regulation, autonomy etc. picking something exciting because it's *his choice* but still running back to swapping with dad because he's got the emotional satisfaction of \"choosing\" even though it's something he doesn't like and still needs comfort (the food he'll actually eat).  Behavior like this also suggests he's still looking to his dad to be there, to 'help him' when he reaches a point past his threshold.  kids often set themselves up in need of minor rescuing to gauge their ability to rely on adults to bail them out.  It is a part of developing risk-management and risk-reward behavioral skills. \n\nIt's an expensive and poor habit but kids do stuff like this *a lot*, especially at the onset of puberty.  Kids generally don't have jobs, don't know how much their parents make and have to budget and have little real concept of cost.  Additionally, up to a certain point, kids are used to, especially with mealtime being given what they want (especially as a matter of conflict resolution). I don't think it's fair to call that spoiling (even if that's close) because winning the war of making sure a kid eats often is worth the losing battle of fighting over it.  At this age however (onset of middle school), the reinforcement of boundaries needs to be set.  OP is well in the right to nip this in the bud. \n\nMy sister and brother did stuff similar: my sister would order the most expensive thing she could (or chicken Parm), eat like three bites and take home the leftovers.  She wouldn't eat them but would monitor them like a hawk and have a meltdown if anyone else touched her food while she left it to rot.  One day my mother had enough and announced the \"Easter Rule\": check the tomb on the third day.  If she didn't eat the leftovers in three days, she clearly didn't want it and it was up for grabs because ultimately my mom paid for it and was tired of her money being wasted. Ma then told my sister if she wanted the leftovers that badly by day three she could pay for them.  Knocked that off real quick. \n\nMy brother would try to order extra (like a second entree after we ate) because he wanted to try something else after eating his whole entree, or extra stuff to bring home, just to see how far he could get with making his requests elaborate. Ma also had to shut that down by telling him anything extra he ordered had to come out of his own pocket or be shared evenly.\n\nOP, sit down with your son and be direct that it's unfair to constantly have to give up your food to correct his misjudgment and if you've been given him an allowance/he's got a paper route or anything like that begin charging him when he waffles on food choices.  Telling him to commit to food he ordered isn't starving him or tell your wife to start offering her food instead.  And don't be afraid to look like a bad guy for ordering for him: if you're paying, you're still entitled not to have your money wasted by his experiments with autonomy.", "Telling a kid that they have to finish what's on their plate regardless is actually a really risky thing to do. It can lead to the kid having a really unhealthy relationship with food. \n\nNow that risk is lessened if it's only at takeout places (depending on how often they eat out?), but it is still a risk. And in addition it also can teach a kid they don't have the right to decide what happens to their body.

Something safe that the son can have should he not like the main meal? You are still teaching consequences but he would have something in his belly albeit a bit more boring than if he had made a different choice.

I just want to eat what I ordered", "That\u2019s what parents do for a 7 year old, this is not age appropriate at all. He is in 8th grade", ">(This is what most parents do - do you want A, B or C?\u201d)\n\nThis is not what any parent of a 12 year old that I know now, or have known in the past does.  My own kids are in their twenties now, and have been ordering for themselves since they could comfortably read a menu.  Even before they could read all the words, they wanted to study the menu and took great pride in making their own decisions.  \n\nIf I would have tried to pull what you suggested, \u201cDo you want A, B or C?\u201d I would have gotten a death stare and told, \u201cMommy, I can pick MYSELF!\u201d\n\nThe kids knew the rule: what you order is what you get.  Mom and Dad aren\u2019t sharing with you.  \n\nOP, talk to your boy about why he continues to order stuff he know he isn\u2019t going to like.  Maybe he is self conscious about not being adventurous with eating.  Junior high is when most kids really start comparing themselves to others, maybe someone made a crack about your son\u2019s \u201cboring lunch\u201d. Or maybe he\u2019s got a crush on someone who brings exotic food for lunch every day? \n\nTalk to him and find out. It might be something so off the wall that you never would have considered it a problem, but your son views it as his duty to now order the weirdest thing on the menu.  \n\nDon\u2019t infantilize him the way u/Away_Refuse8493 is suggesting.  If you were to do that, it would insult his pride as an adolescent male, which could make his weird food hang ups worse.", "I didn\u2019t say \u201cI want my friends to demand I switch with them\u201d??", "My husband always eats my kid's leftovers (I usually can't due to dietary requirements) and if any of us get something \"new\" or \"unusual\", we tend to share a forkful. It's friendly and I love it.\n\nWe also talk about what we're all having *before* ordering so we can optimise. If it's likely that me and kid will want to share, we order it gluten-free, or sometimes we might get extra sides instead of a main to make the food \"share\" further.\n\nOrdering a whole meal for one person who might not like it is a moderately high-stakes way to try new things - maybe there would be a way of trying it without it being a whole meal?", "It goes away sometimes! My younger sister has finally started trying spices and oh-so-scary things like ketchup (she woke up one day at the age of 6 and decided she hated ketchup) and non-kids-menu/plain restaurant foods. She still wont eat potato gnocche despite liking it before she found out it was made with potatoes... but it's getting there. She's just turned 19 though so definitely not optimal lmao", "It went away for me. I still have things I don\u2019t eat, but I try things and eat more variety than my father who swears he\u2019ll eat anything.", "OP when both of your tummies are full talk to him. With the intention of understanding (not the intention of proving to him he\u2019s wrong). *Hey buddy, can you help me understand why you ordered the fish // foods you don\u2019t like?*\n\nThere\u2019s either something hella interesting or hella mundane (seems like kids\u2019 weird behavior is usually one extreme or another). \n\nMaybe you can find a workable solution once you figure out what\u2019s motivating him. Ie, maybe he heard eating fish makes you grow big and strong and even though he doesn\u2019t like fish, he tries to force himself. Easy fix (fish smoothie with protein powder /s)", "You need to try to get to the bottom of why he is ordering food he doesn't like.\n\nPersonally I'd take his choice away and order on his behalf if he makes obviously ridiculous choices.\n\nHowever I know this would not be a long term solution.", "It's past time for you to actually initiate a conversation about this. Maybe it's bullying, maybe it's something else, but obviously just waiting for him to decide to explain why he keeps making these choices isn't working.", "Of course it is. \n\nIt was meant as a joke, since teenagers sometimes want to push every boundary and button.", "Probably means that he should order his son the same thing he wants himself and let the kid pick his own meal again when he's old enough to order something he'll actually eat.", "You misunderstood me. I meant that OP should order 2 of whatever he's eating and let the kid have one of them (instead of ordering something he won't eat anyway). Others have suggested that OP should pick out dishes he's willing to eat from the menu and let the kid choose from those", "Right?  What kind of lesson do you teach a kid by buying him an extra dinner. I love his enthusiasm to try new dishes, but you can't just keep buying him extra meals. Imagine if he buys a second dinner and the kid doesn't like it and wants a third... a fourth...a tenth.... where does it end? When dad goes broke?", "And you should be able to eat your food.  Tell your wife she can give up her food for this child who refuses to order what he actually wants.  HE needs some accountability, making him eat what he ordered is a great natural consequence.", "That's fair, and it's okay to hold your ground as you did. Especially if you continue to warn him right before ordering. Nta", "Tell him he has to order what you do then. He's obviously not grown up enough to order his own food.", "Honestly, you should have done what you did way sooner, NTA", "I think they are suggesting a short term solution cuz whats proposed isn\u2019t maintainable long term. I agree. I wanna eat what i order.  And you didn\u2019t starve the kid. Theres food at home he can make as in the case your kid was already making a sandwich.", "Then don\u2019t let him order that thing you know he won\u2019t like, he\u2019s 12 he doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you spend money so step up and be a parent for once and tell him no he can order what he knows he likes. It\u2019s you and your wife\u2019s fault this is happening for letting him get away with it all the time.", "Then turn it around. Seriously, there are many options here you can employ without wasting all this food :)", "Meh. I don't do downvotes, I find them the sad little powerplays of people without arguments, so they mean nothing to me.", "He's 12. I'm giving a creative solution. One of many there are. He can take it or leave it, no skin off my nose.", "It doesn't sound like wife was at the restaurant. I think ops solution if just saying \"no\" is just fine.", "Eat what you ordered and live with being called a jerk. It will not last forever.", "Keep doing this.\n\nHe can learn to experiment sometimes, and not others.    If he ordered different things and only hated it occasionally, then I'd say it's good to try new things. But if it's everytime?  He needs to learn to order with his own best interests in mind.\n\nNTA.  Good job teaching him to balance consequences and choices", "Your son is a jerk, and you're a pushover for allowing him to 1. Order food he KNOWS he won't like and 2. Eating his food continuously", "Can't you just buy another dish?", "Have you asked him what he\u2019s trying to accomplish when he does this?\n\nDoes he *want* to like what he ordered, and hopes that this time, something will click and he\u2019ll get over his aversion? Is he ashamed to order what he *actually* wants to eat, and ordering what he thinks is a more \u201cadult\u201d meal in an attempt to impress the invisible audience? What is going through his head when he orders something he has an established history of disliking?", "Yeah I agree with you on that, that solution isn\u2019t age appropriate for an 8th grader. You kid is almost in high-school, he probably can hang out with his friends without you.\n\nDefinitely not age appropriate to do the A, B, C choices", "If he's food sensitive and won't eat what he picks, don't let him order it.  Or buy a can of soup that is strange so he can be adventurous. It's your job to make sure your child is fed, so order for him or give him a couple of options and tell him restaurants are too expensive to be messing around like this.", "I was actually kind of sad when I realized my partner doesn\u2019t want to eat my leftovers. I\u2019m not sure why, I guess I associated it so strongly with an act of manly love and heroism (\u201csure honey, I\u2019ll save you from this last bite of pizza, such a sacrifice.\u201d)\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know why these commenters are acting like this is the biggest deal ever. Weird thing to fixate on tbh, and the punitive reaction in the comments is kind of contrary to the point of going out to eat together. \n\nAnd yeah, there\u2019s a ton of good solutions here that aren\u2019t making the kid order only chicken nugs, or OP giving up his own entire meal. They just need to talk about it like your family does.", "Former picky eater here, had massive massive food and texture issues. \n\nMy mom just kept offering me food to try but with no pressure ( not \u201ceat this or starve\u201d) and eventually I started to try stuff, at first it was bites of her food when I asked to try it, and if I liked it she\u2019d serve it for the next evening meal. I once lived off of soup, cheese sandwiches and other \u2018beige\u2019 foods; I now love vegetables and love trying new things. Sometimes these things do fix themselves!", "Yeah, as with most issues that come up on this sub, it could be figured out / fixed / not fixed but a better situation with better communication. This is the right answer here.", "Why does OP need to do this? He seems to have a completely fine system right now where kid orders something stupid, doesn't eat at the restaurant, and eats when he gets home. Eventually he'll probably just start ordering food he actually wants to eat so he doesn't feel miserable at the restaurant.", ">since teenagers sometimes want to push every boundary and button.\n\nSometimes???", "This is really the better answer. He is losing the ability to select his own food at this point.", "Oh wow, the op is letting their son order his own food at a restaurant, next thing you know they\u2019ll be letting smoke and paying his bail when he takes up street racing.", "cool have another", "You gonna pay for it?", "Are you going to pay for it?", "He\u2019s fucking 12\u2026 this kid is in 8th grade. A 12 year old knows that he likes to eat.", "He is fed. He had a sandwich at home.", "It's a waste of food and money", "From a consequences/learning perspective what OP is doing is fine, but it does sound like they're  wasting money (and food) if no one wants to swap and eat what the son ordered. Honestly I'd consider not taking him out to eat for a while, if he's going to end up eating a sandwich anyway then leave him home to eat a sandwich and stop wasting money.", "Yes, other times they're sleeping.", "And ragtime, shameless music!", "Let\u2019s not be dramatic, he\u2019s knowingly letting him order things knowing he won\u2019t eat them and then ask for OPs food and now op is shocked pikachu face that he wants his food and is moody about it, only reason it\u2019s happening is because they\u2019re continually allowing him to do so, which is wasting food and money btw, op has no one to blame but himself", "Just gonna say as a former server, the times where parents made a big stink about what their kid can or can\u2019t order almost never went well. The kid just gets quiet and sad, the parents are annoyed, I\u2019m weirded tf out, and the kid is only gonna eat the side of fries anyway.", "The kid is 12, not 3. Trying to control what a tween orders for dinner is infantile.\n\nLet him order it, let him suffer if he doesn't eat it, do not order a second meal for him. He WILL learn, you just have to be consistent.", "Then he should stop acting infantile", "And for that to happen his parents need to treat him appropriately for his age, hence my advice"]}
