She's been asking for years to get one and I've always said I didn't want the responsibility of looking after one because they are a lot of work, and my career is very stressful and I like to enjoy my off time by relaxing at home or traveling. \n\nThat didn't stop her as she was always constantly looking for one and always sending me pictures. I can't remember how many times I shared my concerns and feelings for not wanting one. Anyways, she sent me a picture of one that looked like her old dog that died a few years ago and said she really wanted to see it, so I agreed.\n\nWhen we're at the pet store, my wife starts bawling her eyes out, saying she really wants the puppy. I said it wasn't a good idea, but I agreed that if she was willing to be the one to take after her, I would be ok with it.\n\nWe've had her now for a few weeks, and things are going OK. I help out a lot, play with her when I get home from work, take her outside, help feed, and take care of her and watch her when my wife's on meetings or has to run errands. I love her, and she is a sweet puppy.\n\nTo the problem, my wife is traveling for work the next couple of weeks. Puppy is 3/4 months old, and my wife expects me to take care of her when she's gone.  I told her I don't know if I will have the energy do to take care of the puppy with my work schedule, and reminded her of the deal we made when we got the puppy that I didn't want to be responsible for it. \n\nWe've gotten into several big fights since then, so I decided I would ask you all to decide if AITA for not wanting to watch the puppy that I didn't want.\n\nEdit: because I'm not sure if this is relevant....we rescued a pitbull/lab (6M) mix 3 years ago. In the same situation as we are in now,  I was against it, but she was adamant, so I agreed. Her dog from before we were together was 12F and ready to move on to doggy heaven. It was a heartbreaking experience for my wife. The dog helped her with her loss.  He grew more of a bond with me, and I think that's why she wanted another puppy to train. \n\nI have no problem looking after a fully grown/mature dog. He stays home with me. The issue is that a puppy requires a lot of attention and supervision\n\nEdit2: I will take care of the puppy. She lives in a good home in a good neighborhood.  The main issue is my wife dumping this responsibility on me when I was against it from the start.

If the pupper is going to be too much, hire a dogsitter to help out for the week.", "NTA - you made an agreement.  Why can't she board the puppy while she's gone?  There are tons of camps that would take care of the puppy.", "NTA, you were clear at the beginning why you didn\u2019t want one. Can\u2019t she arrange the puppy going for a dog hotel or going to a friend/family instead?", "Bottom line is that its your wife's dog but being part of the family means you need to shoulder some of the responsibility. If you are unable to care for the puppy while your wife travels then she'll need to hire someone to come in during the day to take the puppy out for some play and potty time.", "NTA. You expressed a ton of times that if she wanted to get this puppy she had to be the main caretaker of it. You're already helping with taking her out and feeding her on the regular, it's not your responsibility to take care of the puppy during the two weeks since your deal was very clear. Your wife should find a petsitter.", "ESH.  If you really didn\u2019t want to be part of taking care of a puppy, your wife shouldn\u2019t have nagged and pleaded until she ground you down into agreeing.  That\u2019s not good partner behavior.\n\nBut once you agreed to getting the dog, you had to know there would be occasions when you\u2019d need to help out.\n\nIf your concern is about not being able to do all the care, look into local dog walkers - some of them can be booked for one-on-one playtime and attention, so you could get help with the high energy part of taking care of the dog while she\u2019s away with much lower threat to the pup\u2019s health that boarding presents.", "NTA- your wife made an impulse buy of likely a puppy-mill dog and then expects you to help after you\u2019ve clearly stated how uncomfortable you are with this.\n\nShe needs to make arrangements for this puppy. I feel bad for the puppy because the outlook for impulse buy puppies is not very good.  \n\nNot sure why some comments say step up. Either both people want a pet or not. A puppy is essentially a baby and both people need to 100 per cent agree on taking care of sentient life because of this very reason that it will just be one person doing everything and that\u2019s not fair or realistic.", "You are married. You should be a team. Be a decent husband and look after your families dog.", "NTA - Not everyone on earth wants a dog. She emotionally manipulated the situation and continuing to try to do so. If you don\u2019t want to divorce over a puppy, you\u2019re going to have to be a puppy dad. It\u2019s just the way it is. Is the puppy at least the cutest lil thing or what?", "ESH: \nAs a couple you should have planned through how to deal with the puppy in the first few months. It seems a rushed through scenario that neither of you get how important it is. \nShe shouldn\u2019t have hounded you to get one, you shouldn\u2019t be an ass now you gave in. \nThe dog is the one that is the victim here. \nAs the dog literally cannot be boarded due to age, accept your responsibility of being partnered to your wife and in allowing this to happen and take care of the dog. Then perhaps you can both look at boarding options for when the dog can be. \nThese tit for tat marriages sound exhausting.\n\nEdit: Also reading your responses, you sound like TA. Your wife should never travel? You also failed to mention you already have a dog. So making it sound like a lifestyle issue is disingenuous. You are just refusing to do for one what you are already doing for the other. In fact YTA.", "NTA but all the help and interacting with the puppy you\u2019ve been doing seems to give your wife the impression that it\u2019s now both of your responsibility. You were upfront and honest with her about not wanting the responsibility of a puppy and she agreed to take full responsibility of it.", "NTA. This is the story of why I won't marry someone. One day they want a puppy and now you own a puppy together. Then they'll tell you it's healthy to get a second dog to keep that one company!", "NTA for not be willing to take on full responsibility for the puppy after multiple times telling wife you did not want it. \n\nSolution for your current issue? Take the puppy to doggy daycare. They care during the day, you take the night shift.", "NTA you warned her about it. Dogs really make traveling so much harder. She should look into a kennel to board him at.", "NTA. You told her multiple times you didn't want this and wouldn't have the energy to help out with it, but she didn't care once about how you felt, and pushed and cried until she got her way. Now you're already sucked into helping out with it and doing a good chunk of the work for it, and you never once wanted this. Sounds like she really doesn't care about your thoughts or feelings when it comes to these things.", "NTA. You were clear and consistent from the first time she brought up wanting a dog all the way through her buying one that you did not feel that you had the time or desire to be responsible for it. It sounds like although you finally told her to go ahead if it meant so much to her, but that she should know that you still were not willing to be responsible for it. Marriage is a team, like others have said.  She might even be T A (undecided)  She comes off as a bit selfish and only concerned with her desires regarding the dog, allowing them to overshadow your wishes (and the agreement), and now expects you to \"compromise\" (i.e. be miserable because she wants what she wants).  What would she do if you were traveling together and the dog couldn't come?  Kennel it?  Have someone else watch it?  Whatever that answer is should be what is done.", "NTA. She can get a sitter or take the dog with her. She should have thought about this before getting a dog though. She can't expect you to take care of it for multiple weeks when you said you wouldn't do that.", "YTA. As soon as you agreed to buy a puppy, you became jointly responsible for it. It'd be different if she got it without your agreement. \n\nThe innocent party here is the poor doggo. Do what's right - either look after the dog and take responsibility for your decision, or get it rehomed with a family that wants it.", "YTA. You should've considered something like this would happen when you got the puppy.", "YTA , you knew this would happen. If she travels and you can\u2019t take care of the puppy, don\u2019t get it. I read a book recently where the couple had a toy dog for a month and used normal restrictions they would use with the dog to decide if they could get it. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t just board the dog every time the wife  is away because kennels are very stressful for the puppy and so if you aren\u2019t willing to take care of the puppy and she doesn\u2019t wfh you shouldn\u2019t get it. Also, please vaccinate your dog because it should be vaccinated by now. Basic pet ownership.", "YTA You clearly should have discussed this more before getting the puppy. I assume this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s ever had to travel for work, so were you expecting her to never have another work trip? And if she hasn\u2019t traveled for work before, this was something unexpected.", "YTA. Come on I know you agreed it would be her responsibility but you can\u2019t have reasonably expected to never have to look after it, I don\u2019t know whether your wife travelling is a regular thing but if it was something you knew was likely to happen not really thought what would happen in those times.", "YTA, it\u2019s a couple of weeks.

I just don't think it's fair that I'm stuck in this situation because I was firmly against it from the beginning", "Ehm wait, caring for a **adult dog** is **not the same** as taking care of **a puppy!**\n\nThe wife should have taken **care of her own responsibility to the dog** that she wanted and leaving for **multiple weeks** after getting the puppy **she kept begging for is cruel**.\n\n**Ditching your partner with full responsibility** of the pet she wanted and accepted the **owner** role of is just wrong.", "The dog is not a victim.  She is loved and has a good life. She is taken care of better than you can imagine.\n\nMy wife is free to travel whenever she wants. I just don't agree with her dumping her responsibility on me", "They should be a Team! **Yet she ditches him for multiple weeks with a new puppy** she so desperately wanted and wants him to deal with it all by himself.\n\nTaking care of a puppy is no joke and a lot of work.", "But he didn't want it.", "Yes, I fully plan to. Just stinks that I have to compromise my own happiness.", "He already is helping look after the puppy", "Don't worry, we are not lmao", "Yes, she knew she had to travel,  but I was unaware of the dates. I am still trying to wrap my mind about the timing of this entire situation", "What is your financial situation? Can you bring in a pet sitter or dog walker? Kinda like a \u201cmother\u2019s helper\u201d that babysits while the parent is at home. Might be cheaper than boarding, the pup stays in it\u2019s new environment, and you can still do the things you have been doing already. I\u2019m on the borderline between YTA for sorta teasing your wife with the things you are already doing that you said you wouldn\u2019t, and ESH for that plus your wife\u2019s approach to getting you to dog sit. She should have channeled Dale Carnegie and made you think it was your idea!", "Yes they should be at least 6 mos have rabies and such.  She is not lying", "Ok, that actually makes me lean more towards a N T A vote, since his issue was only with caring for a puppy and not an adult dog, so its not inconceivable that they could've gone 1 year with her taking care of the puppy completely. But the idea that he would go 10-15 years without being responsible for the dog was not reasonable at all.", "This is such a big difference. How can he complain about travelling inconvenience when he already has a dog? Puppies are more energy and clean up, yes, but otherwise between an older dog and a puppy, it isn't THAT different, especially when the puppy has another dog to play with and doesn't solely need human attention", "Ehm, wait,  the **way** you **typed** that is **super annoying**", "Not sure why people insist writing in bold but she\u2019s his wife, not his flat mate. It\u2019s a work trip, not a ditching. Life plans change. Can you guarantee everything that\u2019s going to happen to you next week?\nShe shouldn\u2019t have got it, everyone agrees, but he agreed to get it too. It\u2019s irrelevant whether he \u2018caved\u2019 he\u2019s an adult. \nWhat if she\u2019s ill, has an emergency, is he always going to be \u2018well is your dog?\u2019", "She\u2019s not \u201cditching\u201d. She\u2019s going on a work trip. You can\u2019t really choose to go or not go on those usually. They should really just hire a dog sitter/Walker to help him while he\u2019s at work if he\u2019s not able/willing to help.", "She is going away with work, not a holiday. It\u2019s not a lifetime thing. It\u2019s both your responsibility! Life changes, things crop up, if you agreed in the basis that nothing would be any different for the next ten years, or even the next month, you are incredibly naive and so is she.\n\nThe dog is a victim. It\u2019s been brought into a household we\u2019re 50% of it don\u2019t want it. Your wife was ridiculous doing what she did, you are being ridiculous by not taking responsibility for your part in it. It\u2019s a marriage, not house mates. If you can\u2019t cope, hire in someone to help. That dog is developing fast, and all your current actions will shape that dog. It\u2019s the insinuation that your happiness is what is important. You are an adult, sometimes you have to put yourself out. You want her to jeopardise her job against you just stepping up for a week.\n\nAs another poster put, don\u2019t have kids if this is the sort of hill you want to die on. If you are really against it, then that dog deserves to be in a different home.", "Crying at the pet store? She\u2019s not 4. That\u2019s extreme.", "Then you shouldn't have caved and let her get the puppy", "So does your wife never do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do for your sake?", "She\u2019s not just being lazy and not wanting to though. It\u2019s a work trip. Not even a fun vacation. It\u2019s not like she can take the dog with her or put her in daycare yet. If you need help, hire a sitter or see if a family member will stay with you to help with the dog and keep you company.", "And I will take care of the puppy. I just wanted to know if I was the asshole.  Just feels like I'm being taken advantage of", "Being responsible for a puppy is a lot different than being responsible for a trained pet. Puppies require a lot more work. I am thinking a lot of you on here have never been responsible for a puppy and the amount of work it requires", "You **downplay a lot of work that has to go towards a puppy** and leaving your partner with it all alone is wrong.\n\nShe wanted a puppy but leaves shortly after getting it for **multiple weeks** and **ditches Op to do all the work** by himself? and you see no problem with that?", "Is **ThIs** EvEn **MoRe** AnNoYiNg? **Or** JuSt **ThE** sAmE?", "Well, the corollary to that is that he's her husband, not her flat mate, and he's said for years that he doesn't want a puppy.  \n\nShe made a promise, to her husband, to not make him responsible for the puppy, while probably knowing she had a two week work trip coming up.", "It's still ditching, I doubt she didn't know of a work travel for multiple weeks beforehand. \n\nAnd I'm not saying that there is no way they can't solve this situation, but **she should have been working towards solving those problems** and **not just leave him with all the work of a new puppy all by himself**. \n\nShe should have searched a sitter/walker/trainer for the puppy. \n\nExpecting Op to just do it all alone is crazy especially since he is also working.", "Loss of a loved one is a difficult experience.  I can understand why she acted this way", "I agree. Worth considering is that a lot of pet stores don\u2019t actually sell kittens or puppies. They partner with local rescues to help get dogs and cats of all ages adopted. I suppose it\u2019s possible that this could be the case with their puppy as well.", "Pet store animals are typically rescues from the local pound/human society. They don't usually work with breeders", "At least where I live, nearly all pet store puppies aren't for sale, but for adoption; the local shelters and rescue organizations cycle their puppies through display at the pet shops, people stopping in for one reason or another are struck with love at first sight, the puppies get adopted right away, then the shelters bring in the next batch. The system works out really well!\n\n(I have two cats because of this, when I only went in for one...)", "Did you read my response? I was actually giving you more credit on the basis that it was only the puppy phase you were opposed to.", "How does it change the context? It would be easier to watch one dog than 2", "Puppies are more work, yes, but it's not going from 0 to 100, because they already have a dog, that hopefully they're walking and taking care of properly.\n\nIt's not like she's travelling for fun. It's for work, and that's not something that you always know about that far in advance. She already looked into boarding and it can't be done. Sometimes in a partnership you have to do more than your fair share. What do you reasonably expect to be done here? Not travel for work and risk her job? Give back the puppy? Are you recommending OP just stay mad about it? What's the productive way forward here?", "He said in previous posts she was not expected to travel pre getting the dog, it might be worth reading the background. \n\nAnd no it\u2019s not ditching. I\u2019m not sure where you are in work life but telling an employer no is not always an option. Then we get a post \u2018wife got fired for keeping to our agreement. She should have asked me first\u2019 type of thing.", "Probably meant to reply to Nessa_E, they hounded him on another comment too. I agree, taking care of a puppy is hard, even if you work from home. I did it for 5 days for my family\u2019s puppy and even with my two dogs, it was difficult. I was often stepping away to tend to the puppy, luckily with my job I don\u2019t have to be at the screen all day long.", "Because you make it sound you wanted a pet free home. People are responding as though your wife forced you to get a dog when it doesn\u2019t suit your lifestyle. It\u2019s nothing to do with lifestyle. You\u2019ve had a dog already. \nPersonally I\u2019d edit the post to make it clear you already have a dog but it might not garner the responses you want. \nYou wife is also an idiot for taking on a second dog. It obviously isn\u2019t from a desire to have a pet.", "Yes, I agree. My wife has many veterinary friends and has worked in the field. I am not very familiar with the timeliness for vaccines in a puppy, so I trust their advice", "Sorry, I am new to this. It is my first post", "It\u2019s okay, the comment structure can be weird, especially on mobile. For what it\u2019s worth, I think your wife should look into a sitter, maybe even one that can come to your house for the duration of her trip. It\u2019s nice that you still help with the puppy, but I agree being left alone for an extended period of time is tough, especially if you work.", "And yeah I meant to respond to the other one", "Yes. We have a 7 yo 50 lb putbill/boxer and a 9 month old 70 lb pitbull lab. It\u2019s not the easiest thing to do, but it\u2019s a good work out lol. I recommend a waist leash if you don\u2019t already have one.", "I've seen dog walkers with 6 or more dogs on leashes, all of different sizes and ages. Now you just sound whiny.", "Thank you! I appreciate it", "Seen dogwalkers? So you admit you've not done so yourself.  Thanks for your opinion", "I've seen lots of things I haven't actually done, so I know they're possible. Like flying a plane or performing surgery.\n\nEnjoy your puppy!"]}
