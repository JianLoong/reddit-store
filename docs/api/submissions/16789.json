If the pupper is going to be too much, hire a dogsitter to help out for the week.", "NTA - you made an agreement.  Why can't she board the puppy while she's gone?  There are tons of camps that would take care of the puppy.", "NTA, you were clear at the beginning why you didn\u2019t want one. Can\u2019t she arrange the puppy going for a dog hotel or going to a friend/family instead?", "Bottom line is that its your wife's dog but being part of the family means you need to shoulder some of the responsibility. If you are unable to care for the puppy while your wife travels then she'll need to hire someone to come in during the day to take the puppy out for some play and potty time.", "NTA. You expressed a ton of times that if she wanted to get this puppy she had to be the main caretaker of it. You're already helping with taking her out and feeding her on the regular, it's not your responsibility to take care of the puppy during the two weeks since your deal was very clear. Your wife should find a petsitter.", "ESH.  If you really didn\u2019t want to be part of taking care of a puppy, your wife shouldn\u2019t have nagged and pleaded until she ground you down into agreeing.  That\u2019s not good partner behavior.\n\nBut once you agreed to getting the dog, you had to know there would be occasions when you\u2019d need to help out.\n\nIf your concern is about not being able to do all the care, look into local dog walkers - some of them can be booked for one-on-one playtime and attention, so you could get help with the high energy part of taking care of the dog while she\u2019s away with much lower threat to the pup\u2019s health that boarding presents.", "NTA- your wife made an impulse buy of likely a puppy-mill dog and then expects you to help after you\u2019ve clearly stated how uncomfortable you are with this.\n\nShe needs to make arrangements for this puppy. I feel bad for the puppy because the outlook for impulse buy puppies is not very good.  \n\nNot sure why some comments say step up. Either both people want a pet or not. A puppy is essentially a baby and both people need to 100 per cent agree on taking care of sentient life because of this very reason that it will just be one person doing everything and that\u2019s not fair or realistic.", "You are married. You should be a team. Be a decent husband and look after your families dog.", "NTA - Not everyone on earth wants a dog. She emotionally manipulated the situation and continuing to try to do so. If you don\u2019t want to divorce over a puppy, you\u2019re going to have to be a puppy dad. It\u2019s just the way it is. Is the puppy at least the cutest lil thing or what?", "ESH: \nAs a couple you should have planned through how to deal with the puppy in the first few months. It seems a rushed through scenario that neither of you get how important it is. \nShe shouldn\u2019t have hounded you to get one, you shouldn\u2019t be an ass now you gave in. \nThe dog is the one that is the victim here. \nAs the dog literally cannot be boarded due to age, accept your responsibility of being partnered to your wife and in allowing this to happen and take care of the dog. Then perhaps you can both look at boarding options for when the dog can be. \nThese tit for tat marriages sound exhausting.\n\nEdit: Also reading your responses, you sound like TA. Your wife should never travel? You also failed to mention you already have a dog. So making it sound like a lifestyle issue is disingenuous. You are just refusing to do for one what you are already doing for the other. In fact YTA.", "NTA but all the help and interacting with the puppy you\u2019ve been doing seems to give your wife the impression that it\u2019s now both of your responsibility. You were upfront and honest with her about not wanting the responsibility of a puppy and she agreed to take full responsibility of it.", "NTA. This is the story of why I won't marry someone. One day they want a puppy and now you own a puppy together. Then they'll tell you it's healthy to get a second dog to keep that one company!", "NTA for not be willing to take on full responsibility for the puppy after multiple times telling wife you did not want it. \n\nSolution for your current issue? Take the puppy to doggy daycare. They care during the day, you take the night shift.", "NTA you warned her about it. Dogs really make traveling so much harder. She should look into a kennel to board him at.", "NTA. You told her multiple times you didn't want this and wouldn't have the energy to help out with it, but she didn't care once about how you felt, and pushed and cried until she got her way. Now you're already sucked into helping out with it and doing a good chunk of the work for it, and you never once wanted this. Sounds like she really doesn't care about your thoughts or feelings when it comes to these things.", "NTA. You were clear and consistent from the first time she brought up wanting a dog all the way through her buying one that you did not feel that you had the time or desire to be responsible for it. It sounds like although you finally told her to go ahead if it meant so much to her, but that she should know that you still were not willing to be responsible for it. Marriage is a team, like others have said.  She might even be T A (undecided)  She comes off as a bit selfish and only concerned with her desires regarding the dog, allowing them to overshadow your wishes (and the agreement), and now expects you to \"compromise\" (i.e. be miserable because she wants what she wants).  What would she do if you were traveling together and the dog couldn't come?  Kennel it?  Have someone else watch it?  Whatever that answer is should be what is done.", "NTA. She can get a sitter or take the dog with her. She should have thought about this before getting a dog though. She can't expect you to take care of it for multiple weeks when you said you wouldn't do that.", "YTA. As soon as you agreed to buy a puppy, you became jointly responsible for it. It'd be different if she got it without your agreement. \n\nThe innocent party here is the poor doggo. Do what's right - either look after the dog and take responsibility for your decision, or get it rehomed with a family that wants it.", "YTA. You should've considered something like this would happen when you got the puppy.", "YTA , you knew this would happen. If she travels and you can\u2019t take care of the puppy, don\u2019t get it. I read a book recently where the couple had a toy dog for a month and used normal restrictions they would use with the dog to decide if they could get it. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t just board the dog every time the wife  is away because kennels are very stressful for the puppy and so if you aren\u2019t willing to take care of the puppy and she doesn\u2019t wfh you shouldn\u2019t get it. Also, please vaccinate your dog because it should be vaccinated by now. Basic pet ownership.", "YTA You clearly should have discussed this more before getting the puppy. I assume this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s ever had to travel for work, so were you expecting her to never have another work trip? And if she hasn\u2019t traveled for work before, this was something unexpected.", "YTA. Come on I know you agreed it would be her responsibility but you can\u2019t have reasonably expected to never have to look after it, I don\u2019t know whether your wife travelling is a regular thing but if it was something you knew was likely to happen not really thought what would happen in those times.", "YTA, it\u2019s a couple of weeks. What did you expect, for her to not be able to ever leave?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
