I didn't ask for them they just prides themself on a heavy hand pour.\nSo I was very drunk. The last thing I remember is vomiting all over the bar bathroom floor because I couldn't make it in time to the toilet and cleaning it up. \n\nI found out later from my husband that I was passed out in the street against a window to where the cops came and talked to me to make sure I was ok. \n\nI don't remember any of that but he must have told me to order an Uber and somehow I ordered it but in my drunk state ordered the really expensive one since when I checked today after sobering up I saw the trip cost $62 for a 15 mile ride that's usually $20. \n\nAnyway, so he sent me home by myself blackout drunk.\nToday I checked the cameras in our driveway and saw the driver had to wake me up which I don't remember anything so even if he did do anything else to me I wouldn't know. \nWhich makes me feel really uneasy.  \n\nWhen I woke up I asked my husband did you send me home by myself last night in the Uber and he said yea but he tried calling to make sure I got home. \nSo when I didn't answer those 2 calls because I was passed out he still decided to stay out for another 2 hours instead of making sure I was home safe. So I'm annoyed about that too.  \n\nMy sister in law told me she was worried about me even and asked him to check Uber if I got home safe and my husband told her he can't check because I was the one that ordered the Uber.\n\nI have gotten more and more angry as I have thought about it and I blew up and told my husband I wouldn't have done that to my worse enemy and started crying.\n\nHe thinks I'm overreacting but I can't stop thinking about how vulnerable I was last night.\nAm I overreacting? Is this something other people do since Uber is a business and considered safe to take by yourself.\n\n\nEDIT for extra information in comments \n\nThe bartender poured heavy. When we first got there my husband asked the bartender are you a heavy pourer or do I have to pay extra. The bartender said I always pour heavy and at that point I just had a bloody beer so didn't know how heavy his pours were and the next drinks my husband went and got them for me and I told him to get me cran vodkas. \n I didn't know they were double shots until I already had 2 and went to go get my own this time and saw he filled the cup over half full of vodka and splashed some cran juice. I didn't know it was that heavy. Also I figured I am with my husband I can drink and not worry about anything happening to me. \n\nI'm not apologizing for getting drunk with my husband.\n\nBut I was dumb for drinking that much anyway since I rarely ever drink.

And especially when you\u2019re in company that you trust to take care of you. I can\u2019t think of anyone who would fit that bill more than a husband. It\u2019s not like people get blackout drunk with their parents often. \n\nYour husband is the AH. Can we trust this guy with children, in a crisis, if you get awfully sick?
