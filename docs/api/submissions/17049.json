You have moved on and remarried. Your ex is friends of the bride and groom.\n\nDemanding anyone in the family stay away from someone they knew and liked after a mutual breakup as you present it is weird, doubly so after you remarried.\n\nEither it wasn't mutual, or you are acting rather immature. Either way, the bride is right here. It's her wedding, she chooses the guest list. You and your husband aren't being excluded in favor of the Ex, you are all invited.", "YTA. Your title is wrong. You're not asking her to not invite someone; you're asking her to UNINVITE someone. That's super fucking rude. Your family doesn't have to stop being friendly with someone just because you tell them to. Get over yourself.", "I dont understand several parts of this \n\n1. Presumably your extended family knows your husband so why does it matter that they know your ex? Also what does you being pregnant have to do with any of this?\n\n2. The ex is going as their friend while i wouldnt put you at the same table you dont really have to interact with him right?\n\n3. Were you hanging out with your sister before but now you arent? Are you inviting your sister over? How do you know how much time he hangs out with them?", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding day. Your feelings about your pregnancy belly/husband\u2019s attendance don\u2019t matter to her. She is close to your ex, the breakup was amicable and everyone else is acting like adults here. You should too.", "I\u2019m sorry for the situation, but my vote is YTA. You had two choices in front of you (go or not to go), and neither of those choices was to coerce your sister\u2019s guest list. At this point, you should decline the invitation to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to see the ex. Yes, going would have been respectful, but you\u2019ve thrown respect out the window a long time ago. \n\nI hate to say it out loud, but from your story, my gut feels you\u2019ve created a mess in the past 12-18 months. You say the split was amicable, but you\u2019re the one here on Reddit not wanting to see the ex, and not wanting your family to get along with him (while fully admitting that neither of you did anything wrong). \n\nAnd BTW-your pregnancy doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this story, except maybe have something to do with your emotional state. Truthfully, I\u2019m very worried for your husband in all of this. You sound still hung up on ex. Husband is new to the family, and under constant scrutiny. He\u2019s the only one that should be here asking for advice.\n\nEdited to add: maybe a solution would be to send your husband to the wedding and you stay home\u2026", "YTA \nyou are allowed to let your sister know that he\u2019s making you uncomfortable or whatever but it\u2019s your sisters wedding so you don\u2019t get to ask for someone to be uninvited. \nyour ex is your sisters friend and she wants him there. \nif you really have a big problem with your ex, don\u2019t go.", "YTA - the relationship ended amicably and you moved on quickly. He had no hard feelings about that, and your family have stayed close to him, it\u2019s not betraying you as you ended things amicably and he done nothing to hurt you. I\u2019m wondering why you made the comment that it\u2019ll be shitty because you have to go with your \u2018big belly\u2019 \ud83e\udd14 that\u2019s a strange comment you\u2019ve made since you\u2019re now married and expecting a child.", "YTA\n\nYour ex was part of your family since you were kids. Then you dumped him for another dude and, this time, immediately went straight to life partner with marriage, a kid, the whole nine yards, in, what, a few weeks?\n\nYou won't admit that you dumped your ex for another dude, but your sister knows you did.  \n\nWhen your sister called your husband and blamed him, that was a mistake on her part, but she also only did that after you world not stop selfishly sticking your nose into her business.   \n\nWhat you should take away from it was that you and your husband were invited to this wedding as well and I don't hear one word about your ex being a giant baby about it, even though you are going to be there pregnant and with the man you dumped him for.\n\nThat's pretty grown up and mature, isn't it? To go to a wedding , knowing his ex will be there with her \"he's just a friend\" new husband that actually wasn't just a friend at all. Your ex is going for the sake of his friends because it's an important day in their lives. Doesn't that make you respect him more? Who wouldn't want a friend with that kind of emotional courage?\n\nIt speaks volumes that you are the one with the giant problem here.  Your husband will eventually be accepted into your family, especially with the baby coming, but now in their eyes he's just an interloper that is too cowardly to face your ex.  \n\nYour ex is acting like an adult and you and your husband are acting exactly like your family expects you to act after how it all went down, like selfish people who don't want to deal with inconvenient feelings of guilt.\n\nIt's extremely important for all involved that your husband go to this wedding and handle this like an emotionally mature person. If he wants your family's respect, that is. Doesn't sound like he has much right now.", "YTA. You mention it wasn't a bad break up. You never mention mistreatment. Yet you take it upon yourself to force a wedge between your family and your ex who has also known your family 6+ years. You're acting like a spoiled brat who didn't get her way. You ought to apologize to your parents and sister. No wonder they stayed in touch with your ex boyfriend. I'm willing to bet he never guilt tripped them about anything.", "You\u2019re probably the AH.  I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so hung up on the ex despite being \u2018over the moon happy\u2019 with your husband & pregnancy.", "It\u2019s her wedding if you are u comfortable with the ex being there avoid him or stay home. But don\u2019t put your sister in this position of choosing because she may not choose you. Yta", "YTA You don\u2019t have any valid reason not to want him there. Your family members and your ex seem to mean a lot for each other. So of course they invited him. You have no right to deny them a loving relationship. You request is baseless and selfish.", "YTA\n\nYou and your ex parted amicably. There was no wrong-doing that warrants \"siding\" with you *and* you're married and pregnant -clearly you have moved on! If your ex is \"found family\" to your sister and her husband-to-be, you should be a mature, civil adult, and accept that your ex/their friend, going to be at their wedding. MYOB. Your sentiments toward your ex are yours to manage, your husband's insecurities are his.", "YTA. You\u2019re not asking her not to invite him, you\u2019re asking her to uninvite him. You\u2019re clearly aware he already received an invitation as you asked if he confirmed yet. How is it a shitty situation for him to come knowing your family? How is it a shitty situation for him to come while you\u2019re there with your big belly and husband if you\u2019re over the moon happy? \n\nAnd tbh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair of your family to have judged you for the breakup if after only a few weeks you started dating a \u201clong time genuine friend\u201d. Honestly it looks like you may have been having an emotional affair or at the very least, left your bf for your new husband", "YTA. Why are you so obsessed with an EX? It feels like you have not moved on and being an AH to your current husband as well.", "How are you married when you only broke up last year? That would mean you've been with your husband for maximum 17 months. Sorry but this time line doesn't make sense to me.", "YTA. You broke up, muttual you said, even though I imagine when you started with your husband merely weeks after I'm sure he started to doubt you (justified in my opinion), you are married and with chilid so if you feel uncomfortable is for your own conscience not for anything the ex had done, I'm guessing the ex didn't like your relationship with your \"close friend\" during your time together and when you got together you confirmed his suspicion. YTA.", "YTA. It sounds to me like you dumped him for \u201cthe friend she tells you not to worry about.\u201d You immediately got with someone you had been friends with for a long time. That\u2019s your prerogative, but you have to be aware that probably really added salt to your ex\u2019s wound, and your family knows that. INFO: was this friend an affair partner? You also mention in your comments that the times you have broken up has been initiated by you, and the boyfriend has faced more emotional damage. \n\nI\u2019m just pointing that out because this relationship clearly didn\u2019t end amicably or beautifully as you claim. And also you\u2019re the one making an issue, so this is doubly your fault. If you\u2019re so insistent that everyone has moved on, then you need to move on.", "YTA. They are good friends with him and if the split was as amicable as you suggested, you should be OK with running into him in social situations every now and then. It is not like you will be hanging out with him, just say hi, have 2 minutes of awkward chit chat and move on. I do not know how your big belly comes to play into it. Do you expect your ex to cry at the sight and say this should have been my baby? Do you think the extended family will be confused about who you are with?\n\nI think the bigger issue is you seem to feel your sister chose your ex over you, and you were sidelined. You might possibly think that it is their friendship with and loyalty to your ex that makes them unwelcoming to your husband. You might be right or completely off base on that, it is impossible to know as an outsider. Either way though, ultimatums are not the way to go. You should take your ex completely out of the equation. No more questions, no more remarks to your sister, nothing. None of your business. \n\nWhat you should focus on, if it bothers you, is creating a bond between your husband and your sister and her spouse. Invite them to activities you all might enjoy, try to find common hobbies or something you can share. Also try to understand there is a specific reason for your sister to dislike your husband. Maybe it is a misunderstanding/something that can be fixed.", "INFO: Was there any conflict between your sister and SO apart from him not being your ex?", "YTA. Here is why...\n\nYou do not get to dictate who people can be friends with.\n\nYou do not get to dictate if people should be accepting your husband. \n\nYou do not get to dictate who should or should not come to a wedding. \n\nHas it ever crossed your mind that maybe your husband has a personality that people don't like? And don't think that ex cares that you are pregnant or not. Stop thinking that the world revolves around you and your husband.", "YTA. That was frankly self-centred of you and actually quite manipulative. Don't go to the wedding; you clearly don't want to, so don't try to play the martyr here.\n\nYou got with your current husband a 'just a few weeks' after the break up. Your ex they had known for 6 years; your husband they've known from roughly one year. Maybe realise that not everyone is here to work to your timescale?", "YTA - so within a year you broke up, started dating someone else, got married and pregnant? You do see how that looks suspicious right?\n\nJust ask that you don\u2019t be seated near each other.", "YTA. I was prepared to be on your side based on the title but you are being ridiculous. You had an amicable break up. You moved on and are \u201cover the moon\u201d happy. Your ex has a friendship with your sister and her fianc\u00e9 that has nothing to do with you.", "YTA - 6 years and you are dating two weeks after the breakup with someone you\u2019ve known and spent time with. MAYBE you didn\u2019t cheat, but it\u2019s blatant you wanted to and already had them picked out. Your family sees this, they seem to prefer your ex over you at this point. I think you are leaving a lot of info out if they are so dedicated to taking his side", "YTA-  Since the bride and groom regularly hang out with your ex he is now no longer \u201cmy sister\u2019s ex\u201d to them but \u201ctheir good friend\u201d.  It would be rude to not invite \u201ctheir good friend\u201d because he happens to be \u201cyour ex\u201d.   Congrats on the pregnancy and maybe try to celebrate your sister\u2019s big day with out the Gloom and Doom attitude", "Don't really see what your family's relationship with your ex has to do with you. Particularly if you split amicably. Don't talk to him at the wedding if you're so worried about shit going South \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYTA.", "ESH, your sister is friends with your ex who did nothing bad to you, so you don't get to demand she doesn't invite him. But her blaming your husband for your bad relationship with her and seemingly blaming you for breaking up with your ex is just as shitty.", "INFO you grew distant,  was the split amicable? Is there a reason you're unhappy to be seeing him?", "I'm gonna say NAH. I get that it's hard for you with your family still being in contact with your ex, especially where you mentioned he used to be controlling and jealous - you would think that family would distance themselves too due to those circumstances. \nAlso with your husband not being made particularly welcome makes me think that someone could possibly have stirred the pot making it seem like the \"good friend\" who became your husband was the cause of your break up.\nYou had a right to ask, but your sister also has the right to refuse.\n\nNow for a little advice - stop trying to force relationships with people, even family. Family isn't necessarily blood, but who acts like family. Your sister isn't putting much (if any) into actually maintaining a good relationship with you, so distance yourself. Stop reaching out. Concentrate on you, your husband and the little on who is growing inside of you. Build YOUR family.", "[deleted]", "Okay, besides the post I've read a bunch of comments from raters as well as OP.\n\nI would agree with most, that YTA for what you did. (Trying to make your sister un-invite your ex)\n\nHowever, I understand your unhappiness because of the way you and your husband get treated by your family.\n\nI think your break up with your ex was mutual and all. But I think you are not okay, that your ex holds a higher place in your family, than your husband. (you tell us this) And I agree, in a perfect world your family would bond with your husband, too. \n\nBut you have to admit. Even if it happened the way you describe it: Getting together 2 weeks after a break up and then marrying 1 year later looks incredibly suspicious. As everyone in the comment section is drawing their own conclusions, very likely your family members did as well. It just looks super bad, don't you think yourself?\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nNow looping back to what you want and what you did:\n\nYou want your husband to be accepted by your family and everyone to bond. (right?) I don't know what all you did try to make this happen in the past, but all your efforts seem to have failed. And now you went and tried to make your sis uninvite your ex.\n\nWhat did you expect to fruit from this action? You definitely can't eradicate one person and replace it with your husband. That's not going to work, ever. What you should try is to bring your husband closer into the family. Invite them over to you, go visit them. Bring him with you at family ghaterings, etc.\n\nTrust and respect must be earned and due to the way you started dating your husband, you made this pretty hard for him (your husband). This needs time and effort. And you need to watch out what you're doing, because things like \"trying to get your ex un-invited in your sis wedding\" will only make this harder and harder.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nI suggest you take your time and list what is the things you want in as simple form as possible (keywords, where possible). And then you write in similar fashion what you don't want.\n\nFrom there on you can formulate your goals and find ways to make small steps towards them.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nBy the way, if that's true how your ex treated you, then you lived in an emotionally very abusive relationship for 6.5 years. Good for you, for getting out of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He was controlling and jealous and after a few years of trying to understand his pov, I decided he's not the right person for me. Because I refused him controlling me, that led to him being unhappy with me. And I loved this guy, seeing him unhappy with me triggered the 'hey let's talk' talk between us, where we decided to end things mutually.\n\nI never ever asked anyone to stay away from him. My focus was always my own relationship with my family, which was starting to feel cold and unsupportive because of their pity towards him. \n\nSome situations to explain: we (my family and I) had a shared netflix account, where there are a couple of sub-accounts: Parents, sister & fiance, me & my ex. After the breakup it was just me. And after a couple of months of dating, it was me & my current husband. My sister than demanded me to delete my husband's name from the sub-account, since my ex is still using it (I didn't know that). I just switched to my own Netflix account to avoid conflict. This is just not normal to me, prioritizing the ex over my current relationship.\n\nAgain, the netflix thing was just a small situation to explain why I think the priorities are mixed up.", "I never asked her to uninvite him.

She's just supporting him, which is ok by me.\n\nIn this 1y period I was the only one initiating hanging out because I want me and her to get along. She does as well (I guess?) but never really asks.\n\nThe over-arching issue for me I guess is that she knows all the details of my previous relationship and why it ended, how unhappy we were, so on. She also sees how happy I am now. In the first couple of months of me dating my current husband, she explicitly refused to meet him, saying that she's still getting over my ex.\n\nAnd yes, saying 'big belly' just meant 'being pregnant'. I'm not insecure about it or anything. :D", "Thank you for the respond either way. Yes, it's a complicated mess, but it didn't have to be.\n\nI have no hard feelings (or any feelings) for my ex, other than respecting him. We live in a small-ish town so we did bump to each other a couple of times and spoke like two normal human beings :D \n\nI am completely taking care of my husband's feelings because he is uncomfortable in this situation and doesn't feel welcome to the family. Which is why I'm sad and think that my family's priorities got a little bit mixed up.", "It's not said explicitly but there's a mention that it's the husband's fault.

The relationship with the ex wasn't perfect (obviously) but nobody ever cheated or physically/emotionally hurt the other half. The problem was just the incompatibility caused by him being controlling and jealous and me rejecting to respect that kind of behavior any longer.\n\nAlso, I made sure to put an accent on the part 'I am ok with them staying in touch' because I agree that it's normal to get attached to a person you spent time with for the 6+ years.

She lost it and told me I'm being selfish and I don't care about HER big day and her wishes being satisfied on that day.\n\nIf you sincerely think that the above is you \"not asking\" her to uninvite ex from the wedding, then it's easy to see that your previous conversations with sister (regarding your worry that she's not spending enough time with your husband) involved you \"not asking\" her to spend much lesser to no time with ex in exchange for her to spend that time with your husband (with you in tow) instead.\n\nIt's very likely true that sister (and other family members) are biased against your husband due to sympathy to ex, but you doing the same by essentially making sister and others have to choose between ex and your husband is not winning you nor your husband any favors. You and your husband shouldn't be hinging your husband's favorability upon pushing the ex out of the picture.\n\nThis kind of \"not asking\" by you for your husband's sake is part of why sister is blaming your husband for you and her not spending more sisterly time together. I mean, you and her were spending a nice time talking about her upcoming wedding until you \"didn't ask\" her that ex not attend. She clued in that you were again \"not asking\" this for your husband's sake. So of course she blamed your husband for your \"non-attempts\" to get rid of her friend from her and others lives.\n\nEdit: Oh, and your title on this post clearly says, **\"AITA for asking my sister not to invite my ex to her wedding?\"** I'm smelling troll, but it's fun to take the bait and poke at the ready-made holes in your troll logic so going to continue.", "I honestly never expected her to do so.

He became part of your family and close with your sister and her boyfriend. You broke up. You found him controlling and jealous, but you blame yourself for that and allowing it. Within a few weeks of breaking up, you began dating a guy who was a long term friend before. You claim there was no affair and no cheating. Now, more or less a year later, and you\u2019re 8 months pregnant and just married the long term friend turned boyfriend.\n\nI think the problem here is you\u2019re not seeing your sister\u2019s POV. So let me break that down:\n\nYou and BF dates 6 years and he became close to your sister and her BF. You break up with him and, very soon after, begin officially dating a guy who was a long term friend.\n\nYour sister, her BF, and your ex all likely think something was happening. They all likely think it was, at best, an emotional affair. They likely think that any jealousy or controlling behavior by your ex was justified the moment you started to date \u201cthe guy you always told him not to worry about.\u201d (This next one is speculation) They likely believe your currently husband did a good job alienating you from your ex by pointing out how he was being \u201ccontrolling and jealous\u201d when you were spending time with him, and therefore they blame any potential affair on your current husband. That would explain why they dislike him so much; they very likely believe he actively worked to break up you and your ex so he could get with you, or they believe that you were having an affair.\n\nThat is the only explanation for why your sister and future BIL are acting the way they do. To them, your ex is a victim, your husband is a manipulator, and you\u2019re possibly a cheater.\n\nNow, I\u2019m going on the assumption that what you have said is true and there was no affair or anything remotely fishy. That your current husband in no way, shape, or form helped shape your decision to dump your ex and get with him.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is, due to the timing (moving on very quickly and with a guy you\u2019d been friends with for a while) and your ex\u2019s jealousy, there is likely no way you will ever convince them that there wasn\u2019t something fucked up behind the break up. I don\u2019t think there is any way for you to prove you didn\u2019t cheat, and there is no way to prove your husband didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d (for lack of a better term) you away from ex. Truly, I cannot imagine any evidence will convince them, nor can I imagine what evidence could exist.\n\nYou\u2019re justified to be annoyed and upset with them for this assumption. But I think most people in their position would make the same assumption (look at this post and how many people are assuming you cheated).\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019d have to say NAH. You\u2019re right to be annoyed, and I can\u2019t blame them for being suspicious.", "Reading your comments is enough to know you\u2019re not nearly as \u201cmature\u201d as you think.. also, you cheated on your ex, own it. \n\nThat aside, don\u2019t add or cause more drama for the bride!

There is no need for them to maintain a friendship with him. If your sister just has to pal around with your ex, then she can do so on her own time, but I wouldn\u2019t continue to trust her.  If we\u2019re talking about events involving FAMILY, she doesn\u2019t need to invite your ex. She needs to respect your feelings about him, even if she doesn\u2019t agree.

Honestly, OP is all over the place and it looks like some people are reimagining the situation into one where OP is tearfully begging sister not to make OP face her abusive ex but sister is insisting that OP must meet ex at the wedding.
