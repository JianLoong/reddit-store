You have moved on and remarried. Your ex is friends of the bride and groom.\n\nDemanding anyone in the family stay away from someone they knew and liked after a mutual breakup as you present it is weird, doubly so after you remarried.\n\nEither it wasn't mutual, or you are acting rather immature. Either way, the bride is right here.", "YTA. Your title is wrong. You're not asking her to not invite someone; you're asking her to UNINVITE someone. That's super fucking rude. Your family doesn't have to stop being friendly with someone just because you tell them to. Get over yourself.", "I dont understand several parts of this \n\n1. Presumably your extended family knows your husband so why does it matter that they know your ex? Also what does you being pregnant have to do with any of this?\n\n2. The ex is going as their friend while i wouldnt put you at the same table you dont really have to interact with him right?\n\n3. Were you hanging out with your sister before but now you arent? Are you inviting your sister over? How do you know how much time he hangs out with them?", "Yes, YTA. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding day. Your feelings about your pregnancy belly/husband\u2019s attendance don\u2019t matter to her. She is close to your ex, the breakup was amicable and everyone else is acting like adults here. You should too.", "I\u2019m sorry for the situation, but my vote is YTA. You had two choices in front of you (go or not to go), and neither of those choices was to coerce your sister\u2019s guest list. At this point, you should decline the invitation to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to see the ex. Yes, going would have been respectful, but you\u2019ve thrown respect out the window a long time ago. \n\nI hate to say it out loud, but from your story, my gut feels you\u2019ve created a mess in the past 12-18 months. You say the split was amicable, but you\u2019re the one here on Reddit not wanting to see the ex, and not wanting your family to get along with him (while fully admitting that neither of you did anything wrong). \n\nAnd BTW-your pregnancy doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this story, except maybe have something to do with your emotional state. Truthfully, I\u2019m very worried for your husband in all of this. You sound still hung up on ex. Husband is new to the family, and under constant scrutiny. He\u2019s the only one that should be here asking for advice.\n\nEdited to add: maybe a solution would be to send your husband to the wedding and you stay home\u2026", "YTA \nyou are allowed to let your sister know that he\u2019s making you uncomfortable or whatever but it\u2019s your sisters wedding so you don\u2019t get to ask for someone to be uninvited. \nyour ex is your sisters friend and she wants him there. \nif you really have a big problem with your ex, don\u2019t go.", "YTA - the relationship ended amicably and you moved on quickly. He had no hard feelings about that, and your family have stayed close to him, it\u2019s not betraying you as you ended things amicably and he done nothing to hurt you. I\u2019m wondering why you made the comment that it\u2019ll be shitty because you have to go with your \u2018big belly\u2019 \ud83e\udd14 that\u2019s a strange comment you\u2019ve made since you\u2019re now married and expecting a child.", "YTA\n\nYour ex was part of your family since you were kids. Then you dumped him for another dude and, this time, immediately went straight to life partner with marriage, a kid, the whole nine yards, in, what, a few weeks?\n\nYou won't admit that you dumped your ex for another dude, but your sister knows you did.  \n\nWhen your sister called your husband and blamed him, that was a mistake on her part, but she also only did that after you world not stop selfishly sticking your nose into her business.   \n\nWhat you should take away from it was that you and your husband were invited to this wedding as well and I don't hear one word about your ex being a giant baby about it, even though you are going to be there pregnant and with the man you dumped him for.\n\nThat's pretty grown up and mature, isn't it? To go to a wedding , knowing his ex will be there with her \"he's just a friend\" new husband that actually wasn't just a friend at all. Your ex is going for the sake of his friends because it's an important day in their lives. Doesn't that make you respect him more? Who wouldn't want a friend with that kind of emotional courage?\n\nIt speaks volumes that you are the one with the giant problem here.  Your husband will eventually be accepted into your family, especially with the baby coming, but now in their eyes he's just an interloper that is too cowardly to face your ex.  \n\nYour ex is acting like an adult and you and your husband are acting exactly like your family expects you to act after how it all went down, like selfish people who don't want to deal with inconvenient feelings of guilt.\n\nIt's extremely important for all involved that your husband go to this wedding and handle this like an emotionally mature person. If he wants your family's respect, that is. Doesn't sound like he has much right now.", "YTA. You mention it wasn't a bad break up. You never mention mistreatment. Yet you take it upon yourself to force a wedge between your family and your ex who has also known your family 6+ years. You're acting like a spoiled brat who didn't get her way. You ought to apologize to your parents and sister. No wonder they stayed in touch with your ex boyfriend. I'm willing to bet he never guilt tripped them about anything.", "You\u2019re probably the AH.  I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so hung up on the ex despite being \u2018over the moon happy\u2019 with your husband & pregnancy.", "It\u2019s her wedding if you are u comfortable with the ex being there avoid him or stay home. But don\u2019t put your sister in this position of choosing because she may not choose you. Yta", "YTA You don\u2019t have any valid reason not to want him there. Your family members and your ex seem to mean a lot for each other. So of course they invited him. You have no right to deny them a loving relationship. You request is baseless and selfish.", "YTA\n\nYou and your ex parted amicably. There was no wrong-doing that warrants \"siding\" with you *and* you're married and pregnant -clearly you have moved on! If your ex is \"found family\" to your sister and her husband-to-be, you should be a mature, civil adult, and accept that your ex/their friend, going to be at their wedding. MYOB. Your sentiments toward your ex are yours to manage, your husband's insecurities are his.", "YTA. You\u2019re not asking her not to invite him, you\u2019re asking her to uninvite him. You\u2019re clearly aware he already received an invitation as you asked if he confirmed yet. How is it a shitty situation for him to come knowing your family? How is it a shitty situation for him to come while you\u2019re there with your big belly and husband if you\u2019re over the moon happy? \n\nAnd tbh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair of your family to have judged you for the breakup if after only a few weeks you started dating a \u201clong time genuine friend\u201d. Honestly it looks like you may have been having an emotional affair or at the very least, left your bf for your new husband", "YTA. Why are you so obsessed with an EX? It feels like you have not moved on and being an AH to your current husband as well.", "How are you married when you only broke up last year? That would mean you've been with your husband for maximum 17 months. Sorry but this time line doesn't make sense to me.", "YTA. You broke up, muttual you said, even though I imagine when you started with your husband merely weeks after I'm sure he started to doubt you (justified in my opinion), you are married and with chilid so if you feel uncomfortable is for your own conscience not for anything the ex had done, I'm guessing the ex didn't like your relationship with your \"close friend\" during your time together and when you got together you confirmed his suspicion. YTA.", "YTA. It sounds to me like you dumped him for \u201cthe friend she tells you not to worry about.\u201d You immediately got with someone you had been friends with for a long time. That\u2019s your prerogative, but you have to be aware that probably really added salt to your ex\u2019s wound, and your family knows that. INFO: was this friend an affair partner? You also mention in your comments that the times you have broken up has been initiated by you, and the boyfriend has faced more emotional damage. \n\nI\u2019m just pointing that out because this relationship clearly didn\u2019t end amicably or beautifully as you claim. And also you\u2019re the one making an issue, so this is doubly your fault. If you\u2019re so insistent that everyone has moved on, then you need to move on.", "YTA. They are good friends with him and if the split was as amicable as you suggested, you should be OK with running into him in social situations every now and then. It is not like you will be hanging out with him, just say hi, have 2 minutes of awkward chit chat and move on. I do not know how your big belly comes to play into it. Do you expect your ex to cry at the sight and say this should have been my baby? Do you think the extended family will be confused about who you are with?\n\nI think the bigger issue is you seem to feel your sister chose your ex over you, and you were sidelined. You might possibly think that it is their friendship with and loyalty to your ex that makes them unwelcoming to your husband. You might be right or completely off base on that, it is impossible to know as an outsider. Either way though, ultimatums are not the way to go. You should take your ex completely out of the equation. No more questions, no more remarks to your sister, nothing. None of your business. \n\nWhat you should focus on, if it bothers you, is creating a bond between your husband and your sister and her spouse. Invite them to activities you all might enjoy, try to find common hobbies or something you can share. Also try to understand there is a specific reason for your sister to dislike your husband. Maybe it is a misunderstanding/something that can be fixed.", "INFO: Was there any conflict between your sister and SO apart from him not being your ex?", "YTA. Here is why...\n\nYou do not get to dictate who people can be friends with.\n\nYou do not get to dictate if people should be accepting your husband. \n\nYou do not get to dictate who should or should not come to a wedding. \n\nHas it ever crossed your mind that maybe your husband has a personality that people don't like? And don't think that ex cares that you are pregnant or not. Stop thinking that the world revolves around you and your husband.", "YTA. That was frankly self-centred of you and actually quite manipulative. Don't go to the wedding; you clearly don't want to, so don't try to play the martyr here.\n\nYou got with your current husband a 'just a few weeks' after the break up. Your ex they had known for 6 years; your husband they've known from roughly one year. Maybe realise that not everyone is here to work to your timescale?", "YTA - so within a year you broke up, started dating someone else, got married and pregnant? You do see how that looks suspicious right?\n\nJust ask that you don\u2019t be seated near each other.", "YTA. I was prepared to be on your side based on the title but you are being ridiculous. You had an amicable break up. You moved on and are \u201cover the moon\u201d happy. Your ex has a friendship with your sister and her fianc\u00e9 that has nothing to do with you.", "YTA - 6 years and you are dating two weeks after the breakup with someone you\u2019ve known and spent time with. MAYBE you didn\u2019t cheat, but it\u2019s blatant you wanted to and already had them picked out. Your family sees this, they seem to prefer your ex over you at this point. I think you are leaving a lot of info out if they are so dedicated to taking his side", "YTA-  Since the bride and groom regularly hang out with your ex he is now no longer \u201cmy sister\u2019s ex\u201d to them but \u201ctheir good friend\u201d.  It would be rude to not invite \u201ctheir good friend\u201d because he happens to be \u201cyour ex\u201d.   Congrats on the pregnancy and maybe try to celebrate your sister\u2019s big day with out the Gloom and Doom attitude", "Don't really see what your family's relationship with your ex has to do with you. Particularly if you split amicably. Don't talk to him at the wedding if you're so worried about shit going South \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYTA.", "ESH, your sister is friends with your ex who did nothing bad to you, so you don't get to demand she doesn't invite him. But her blaming your husband for your bad relationship with her and seemingly blaming you for breaking up with your ex is just as shitty.", "INFO you grew distant,  was the split amicable? Is there a reason you're unhappy to be seeing him?", "I'm gonna say NAH. I get that it's hard for you with your family still being in contact with your ex, especially where you mentioned he used to be controlling and jealous - you would think that family would distance themselves too due to those circumstances. \nAlso with your husband not being made particularly welcome makes me think that someone could possibly have stirred the pot making it seem like the \"good friend\" who became your husband was the cause of your break up.\nYou had a right to ask, but your sister also has the right to refuse.\n\nNow for a little advice - stop trying to force relationships with people, even family. Family isn't necessarily blood, but who acts like family. Your sister isn't putting much (if any) into actually maintaining a good relationship with you, so distance yourself. Stop reaching out. Concentrate on you, your husband and the little on who is growing inside of you. Build YOUR family.", "[deleted]", "Okay, besides the post I've read a bunch of comments from raters as well as OP.\n\nI would agree with most, that YTA for what you did. (Trying to make your sister un-invite your ex)\n\nHowever, I understand your unhappiness because of the way you and your husband get treated by your family.\n\nI think your break up with your ex was mutual and all. But I think you are not okay, that your ex holds a higher place in your family, than your husband. (you tell us this) And I agree, in a perfect world your family would bond with your husband, too. \n\nBut you have to admit. Even if it happened the way you describe it: Getting together 2 weeks after a break up and then marrying 1 year later looks incredibly suspicious. As everyone in the comment section is drawing their own conclusions, very likely your family members did as well. It just looks super bad, don't you think yourself?\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nNow looping back to what you want and what you did:\n\nYou want your husband to be accepted by your family and everyone to bond. (right?) I don't know what all you did try to make this happen in the past, but all your efforts seem to have failed. And now you went and tried to make your sis uninvite your ex.\n\nWhat did you expect to fruit from this action? You definitely can't eradicate one person and replace it with your husband. That's not going to work, ever. What you should try is to bring your husband closer into the family. Invite them over to you, go visit them. Bring him with you at family ghaterings, etc.\n\nTrust and respect must be earned and due to the way you started dating your husband, you made this pretty hard for him (your husband). This needs time and effort. And you need to watch out what you're doing, because things like \"trying to get your ex un-invited in your sis wedding\" will only make this harder and harder.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nI suggest you take your time and list what is the things you want in as simple form as possible (keywords, where possible). And then you write in similar fashion what you don't want.\n\nFrom there on you can formulate your goals and find ways to make small steps towards them.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nBy the way, if that's true how your ex treated you, then you lived in an emotionally very abusive relationship for 6.5 years. Good for you, for getting out of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He was controlling and jealous and after a few years of trying to understand his pov, I decided he's not the right person for me. Because I refused him controlling me, that led to him being unhappy with me. And I loved this guy, seeing him unhappy with me triggered the 'hey let's talk' talk between us, where we decided to end things mutually.\n\nI never ever asked anyone to stay away from him. My focus was always my own relationship with my family, which was starting to feel cold and unsupportive because of their pity towards him. \n\nSome situations to explain: we (my family and I) had a shared netflix account, where there are a couple of sub-accounts: Parents, sister & fiance, me & my ex. After the breakup it was just me. And after a couple of months of dating, it was me & my current husband. My sister than demanded me to delete my husband's name from the sub-account, since my ex is still using it (I didn't know that). I just switched to my own Netflix account to avoid conflict. This is just not normal to me, prioritizing the ex over my current relationship.\n\nAgain, the netflix thing was just a small situation to explain why I think the priorities are mixed up.", "I never asked her to uninvite him.

She also sees how happy I am now. In the first couple of months of me dating my current husband, she explicitly refused to meet him, saying that she's still getting over my ex.\n\nAnd yes, saying 'big belly' just meant 'being pregnant'. I'm not insecure about it or anything. :D", "Thank you for the respond either way. Yes, it's a complicated mess, but it didn't have to be.\n\nI have no hard feelings (or any feelings) for my ex, other than respecting him. We live in a small-ish town so we did bump to each other a couple of times and spoke like two normal human beings :D \n\nI am completely taking care of my husband's feelings because he is uncomfortable in this situation and doesn't feel welcome to the family. Which is why I'm sad and think that my family's priorities got a little bit mixed up.", "It's not said explicitly but there's a mention that it's the husband's fault.

The relationship with the ex wasn't perfect (obviously) but nobody ever cheated or physically/emotionally hurt the other half. The problem was just the incompatibility caused by him being controlling and jealous and me rejecting to respect that kind of behavior any longer.\n\nAlso, I made sure to put an accent on the part 'I am ok with them staying in touch' because I agree that it's normal to get attached to a person you spent time with for the 6+ years.

We rarely had sister-sister time alone, it was rather doing the double-dates (she & her bf and me and my ex). But we do love each other a lot, we're just two completely different people who doesn't have that much in common.", "Absolutely.  All I'm reading in this post is two sisters who don't like each other and who are both self-centered.", "Yes, nothing bad happened. I guess at the end I was the one saying 'it's over' and him just agreeing. He did emotionally suffer more than me.   \n\n\nAlso, this was our 2nd break up. The first one was by me (reason: him being controlling, not allowing me many things out of jealousy). After that one we did our best for a year to try and fix things, even move in together, but it just didn't work. We were both unhappy and we agreed that it's time to move on.", "Thank you for understanding the whole context, I really appreciate it. I understand now that I left out some important notes from the original post.\n\nI learned the hard way not to try for anyone's relationship to work, even though I really want it to. Since then, I only focused on important things - such as my baby's health. It's really hard distancing myself from my sister, the one person you'd thing I'd have a support from. But hey, I'm hoping this will all be a funny situation in a couple of years. \n\nI continued supporting her though. Her maid of honor didn't organize the bridal party, so I offered to do so because I know it means to her.", "I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ve got that completely wrong the sister did nothing wrong except invite her friend to her wedding. OP was the one that brought up him not coming to the wedding because it\u2019s not fair to her and would make her and her new husband uncomfortable well guess what her sisters wedding is not about how she feels is it", "I don\u2019t understand this reaction. OP\u2019s sister stayed friends with her ex and invited him to their wedding. What\u2019s wrong with that? Why wouldn\u2019t she invite him? The sister just invited her friend to her wedding. That\u2019s in no way the same as picking sides. OP is the one creating tension.", "Yea, they broke up \"last year,\" and she's already married and pregnant.", "Definetly this. She tried to twist things in her favor but it's so darn obvious.", "I definitely understand how it can look like. \n\nAs I mentioned in some other threads, my ex and my husband knew each other. The ex knew about every single interaction I had with my husband. I made sure the ex was comfortable with my friends, because he was a jealous type.\n\nMy relationship with my husband prior to us getting into relationship was nothing but friendly. We had no intentions, we both respected the fact I am in the relationship. Us getting together happened spontaneously, after years of being just friends. It happened from nowhere and I'm so happy it did. Just as it happened now, it could have happened years from now.", "how was he controlling and jealous? Interesting this did not come up in orginal OP, sounds like an important detail to gloss over. IE, not sure i believe you.  Doesn\u2019t add up.", "The issue here, and why you remain the asshole in my view, including this and your other comments, is that how you present it here isn't what is happening. They aren't prioritizing him, both you AND ex are invited. As is your husband. YOU want to prioritize your animosity over their friendship. That's fine for your wedding, but means nothing at all for theirs.\n\nEven with the Netflix account, context here is that your sister was paying for it, hence why she had authority to add and limit. You wanted to replace someone she allowed with your new husband. You still had access. Your husband could have watched it through your user account, like 99% of the world does.\n\nYour general tone here suggests that you regularly feel like you have the right to limit who your family hangs out with. That's not great.", ">>\u201cAITA for asking her to reconsider her invite to my ex?\u201d\n\n>>I think I might be an asshole for trying to influence my sister's decisions on her big day\n\nMeaning he\u2019s already invited and you want her to do something about it", "Ah, she probably wanted to look her best and have the \"look how great I look, I bet you are sad I'm not still your girlfriend\" moment. She probably feels heavy and awkward and unattractive and doesn't want to see her ex when she's feeling like that. If that's the case it's incredibly selfish of her.", "Wait she said shes getting over your ex? And refused to meet your new husband? And she blames him for you and your sisters relationship issues? \n\nStill not sure why you being pregnant effects your feelings about your ex going to the wedding \n\nBut overall it sounds like hes there as your sisters fiances friend. So i dont think you should have asked her to stop him from coming, though her reaction to you asking also seems disproportionate.\n\nIm with you and your sister sharing YTA.", "So it\u2019s your husband who would prefer your ex not show up because he\u2019s upset your sister has a better relationship with your ex than with him? If I\u2019m understanding this correctly, your husband should realize that your sister and ex have known each other a long time and you mentioned he\u2019s like family. Since your breakup was mutual and uncomplicated there\u2019s nothing disloyal about your sister and your ex being friends.\n\nIf your husband is too immature to handle the sight of your ex he can skip the wedding.", "Maybe try to take a step back... withdraw your yes to the wedding and stay with your husband or do something with him... first he will feel out of place being that the family havent gotten to know him.. ur pregnant no need to keep adding extra stress on the baby... your sister and her husband will invite whomever that want to invite to their wedding...", "Thanks both for the opinion :D\n\nMe saying 'big belly' is just meaning 'being pregnant', I am not insecure about it or anything. The reasoning behind that comment was that the present state IMO should be the focus and not the past, which is not happening since she's shown 0 interest in building a relationship with my current husband (who is btw not the  jealous type). \n\nThe main problem here is the husband not being accepted or cared for, compared to the ex.", "Because you went to your sister and tried to guilt trip her into rescinding your ex\u2019s invitation under the guise of asking if she\u2019d be okay with him saying no to her wedding. Why even talk about the \u201creally shitty situation if he came\u201d when you know he\u2019s already invited? The only thing she could do would be to uninvite him. You spent HOURS trying to explain yourself. What was there to explain other than to say \u201csorry, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s your wedding and your decision\u201d ?", "Well plain and simple. I don't believe you. There's a reason your folks stayed close with your ex. There's a reason you sister stayed close with your ex. The only options I see as the reason is you, your husband, or both. You don't get to force your husband into your families lives, and expect them to treat them the same as someone they have history with. Nothing you've written or responded to makes me think \"Aww poor them\".

And they are good friends with your ex.\n\nThat's all that matters. \n\nWhy are you making their wedding about your relationship with your family?", "People that have a child often feel like they will never love anyone as much until they have the second. Being friends with your ex is not stopping anyone in your family from being friends with your current husband. You\u2019ve only referenced issues with your sister so it\u2019s not clear how your ex is blocking your husband from bonding with the larger family. It may not be realistic to expect you husband to have a better or closer relationship with you sister and her partner than you do.", "You have to understand that they have a relationship with your ex that developed over years. It sounds like your sister and her fiance are now good friends with him. They aren't going to have that relationship with your new husband, certainly not at first and maybe not ever, because their relationship is with a person who is not simply exchangeable with another person. You're looking at their relationship like it was based on your ex's role as your partner and assuming that they should have that relationship with anyone in that role, but they have that relationship with a person. They may not ever feel the same connection to another person who is your partner, though they should treat him respectfully.", "And why is your husband feeling this way? It\u2019s not like any of your other family members are pushing to get you and your ex back together", "ESH. Her for being distant to your husband because he is loyal to your ex and you for not wanting a friend of your sisters and bils on their wedding. Its their day.", "It doesn't really sound like you seeing him is going to cause you distress. And it's your sister's wedding so its about the people she wants there, like a close family friend.\n\nSo I'm not sure why you think you're entitled to ask fir him to be excluded.\n\nYTA", "It gets more and more confusing. So why don\u2019t you want him to be there? He\u2019s your sister\u2019s friend. You should have a damn good reason to make such a request. It sounds like you have no reason at all.", "We were just kids so I really don't want to talk crap about him or hold him accountable for anything.\n\nI basically didn't have any alone-time in this relationship. It was always me and him, which was fine because I enjoyed it. BUT every time I wanted to go for a drink with a friend, I must send a location and reply back to him within couple of minutes, or he will get angry and give me the attitude. I couldn't spend my breaks between the classes in college with anyone else, he would come and visit me. After college, I found a job which required me to travel for 4 days to the different city, where I had to call him whenever I have free time, so he knows I'm thinking about him. I get a lot of 'why did you spend 6+ years like this' questions when talking to friends right now, but itk, we were immature and I thought that's how the relationship should look like.", "It does read that way. To make it clear: I never asked her to do anything. I am not contacting my ex about it. I was asking about the potential situation in which the ex would respond 'no', but also explaining my view on the situation. No requests were made by me.", "That\u2019s what I automatically thought too.

And tbh a real relationship killer is to ask your sister to uninvite a friend to cater to your husbands insecurities", "Because your ex was close to your sister for 6 years. She doesn't need to throw away a close friendship of 6 years.\n\n\nAnd, you broke up \"last year\" and are already married and pregnant....when did they even have a chance to build a relationship with your current husband?", "The past is she spent years treating your ex as family and you're glossing over whatever problem there is with him going when it was an amicable breakup and you're happy in a new relationship.\n\nYour sister isn't going to treat your husband you got together with last year the same as someone she accepted as family for years. It takes time to build family-type bonds, they probably didn't do it immediately with your ex but they did and they likely will with your husband if you stop demanding they treat someone they've known for less than a year and a half the same as someone they knew the better part of a decade.", ">It\u2019s your wedding and your decision\n\nWhich is exactly what I did at the end, out of maturity and willingness to step out even though we're not at the same page. \n\nMe even bringing it up to my sister is just having a regular conversation, as I would expect my close friends and family to do with me, if they have anything that's sitting on their minds.", "Yes, and the reason is that my ex is genuinely nice person. Just not the right for me.\n\nAnd no need to feel sorry for any of us, I didn't come for it.", "The reason is not me or my husband being uncomfortable about him being there. He did nothing wrong and we don't have anything against him personally.\n\nThe problem is my sister not caring about her relationship with my husband, not as near as she does for my ex. So my husband not being welcome to my family feels so bad if you look at it from his perspective.", "What was the point of even asking her then? It sounds like you asked her and then tried to guilt trip her about how it \u201cshitty\u201d for him to be there. If you\u2019re asking her to do nothing, there was no reason to tell her how you felt. You knew he was already invited. Nothing she can do about it except uninvite it. It seems like you tried to guilt trip her without specifically asking her to uninvite him. Emotional manipulation", "Then why did you title the post 'AITA for asking my sister not to invite my ex to her wedding'?", "So I can't understand why you would have any issue with your ex being there.", "She doesn't have to. But she didn't even try.\n\nAnd I didn't ask her to uninvite him, I simply asked if it would be ok with her if he responded no. Leaving it up to him to respond.", "At the end of HOURS. Just admit you were hoping your sister would tell you that she would ask him not to come. Otherwise there was no point to have this \u201cregular conversation\u201d", "So you came to AITA to hear YTA from 98 or so opinions and still try to plead your case? I stand by what I said you owe your parents and sister an apology. The more humble and contrite you are with your family after apologizing and acknowledging your wrong doings the more likely they could warm up to your new relationship. Safe to say you should never mention your folks or sisters relationship with your ex ever again.", "It\u2019s not his wedding. His perspective doesn\u2019t matter. If he has an issue, he can choose not to attend", "...and you believe ex not being at the wedding will magically make your sister (and the rest of whatever family) rush over to welcome your husband into the family? That the only reason your sister and these other family members are holding back is the presence of your ex?\n\nYTA for making a stink over this now. If you thought your question about ex's attendance was going to somehow make your sister consider your husband in a more favorable light, you got the exact opposite.", "Also hard to blame her for not wanting a relationship if you started dating him only a few weeks after the breakup and he had been a \u201clong term genuine friend\u201d. It looks like you had an emotional affair with him or left your ex for him", "Why would you even ask her? It\u2019s not up to her or you if he says no. Are you trying to pressure him into saying no? You also said \u201caita for asking her to reconsider her invite to my ex?\u201d Meaning you asked her more than is she minded if he declined", ">She doesn't have to. But she didn't even try.\n\nWhy should she try if she doesn't have to?", ">And I didn't ask her to uninvite him,\n\nLet's go back to what you posted:\n\n>A month ago I asked my sister if my ex confirmed his attendance at their wedding and she said 'not yet', to what I asked her if they would be fine if he said 'No'. She got confused and I explained that it will be really shitty situation if he came, because he knew all of our extended family and I'm coming with my big belly and my husband. She lost it and told me I'm being selfish and I don't care about HER big day and her wishes being satisfied on that day.\n\nIf you sincerely think that the above is you \"not asking\" her to uninvite ex from the wedding, then it's easy to see that your previous conversations with sister (regarding your worry that she's not spending enough time with your husband) involved you \"not asking\" her to spend much lesser to no time with ex in exchange for her to spend that time with your husband (with you in tow) instead.\n\nIt's very likely true that sister (and other family members) are biased against your husband due to sympathy to ex, but you doing the same by essentially making sister and others have to choose between ex and your husband is not winning you nor your husband any favors. You and your husband shouldn't be hinging your husband's favorability upon pushing the ex out of the picture.\n\nThis kind of \"not asking\" by you for your husband's sake is part of why sister is blaming your husband for you and her not spending more sisterly time together. I mean, you and her were spending a nice time talking about her upcoming wedding until you \"didn't ask\" her that ex not attend. She clued in that you were again \"not asking\" this for your husband's sake. So of course she blamed your husband for your \"non-attempts\" to get rid of her friend from her and others lives.\n\nEdit: Oh, and your title on this post clearly says, **\"AITA for asking my sister not to invite my ex to her wedding?\"** I'm smelling troll, but it's fun to take the bait and poke at the ready-made holes in your troll logic so going to continue.", "I honestly never expected her to do so. If anything, I expected him to say 'thanks but no thanks', but I never did or planned to do anything about it.", "The wedding is really not the point here. It's the past 1y of mistreatment, you're right.", "I don't understand why should it matter to her when did my current relationship start if this man is making me feel happy?\n\nWhat does it have to do with her relationship with my husband?", "Why would you tell her that it would be a \u201cshitty situation\u201d? To make her worried about drama at her wedding if he does decide to go?", "So you want vindication for the way she didn\u2019t accept your super quick new relationship by making her feel bad about inviting your ex", "If you betrayed your ex by emotionally cheating on him, I can fully understand wanting to distance herself from both you and him. I wouldn\u2019t want to have a relationship with someone who is disloyal. Especially if I saw it hurt someone I\u2019ve known for years and is my fianc\u00e9s friend. \n\nWas there an emotional connection with your husband before you and your ex broke up?", "So it was cheating. Dude.", "Neither me, my husband nor my ex are dramatic people, so no drama will be involved. I was just telling her how it looks from my perspective, as one does with a sister. I made sure to let her know that everything will be ok with the wedding. I even offered to throw the bridal party for her (since her maid of honor bailed). So really no drama here, it was us two having a heated up conversation.", "There was no cheating involved, physical or emotional. My ex knew my current husband, he was invited to some celebrations I organized. I told him about every moment spent together, every message, everything I did with my current husband. After breaking up I had no intentions to get with my current husband, it happened spontaneously. \n\nI was nothing but loyal to this man.", "There was no cheating involved, never. Not physical, nor emotional. I explained it in a different thread.", "But why have the conversation in the first place? Telling her about her wedding being \u201ca shitty situation\u201d just seems needlessly cruel unless you expect her to change something about it.
