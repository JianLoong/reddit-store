I hardly see what your clothes matter, you were decent, in more ways then just covering your private areas. Homeless people are people too. You were decent in acknowledging a life and saying hi with a wave, now that said we live in times where parents fear for their children\u2019s safety probably more than ever, so while you may have intended it in an innocent way it could have been perceived in another. Just be careful, everyone is looking for a reason to flip shit anymore", "NTA.

It never occured to me that smiling and waving at a child could ever be an issue.\n\nNTA, of course. The mother reacted strangely.", "NTA, initially, but.   \n\n\nThis is a 2-3 year old daughter.  The child may be enthusiastically interested in strangers.  The parent may have irrational -- or, according to some, completely rational -- fears of the dangers that strangers can pose to the child,  that the child should be skeptical of strangers, at least at this age, until they are old enough to evaluate a situation for their own safety.    \n\n\nWhen a parent asks a stranger not to interact with their child, the only polite response is \"Certainly. \"  It's not really a decision you get to adjudicate.    \n\n\nAnd, not for nothing, \"Maybe you should teach \\[her daughter\\] not to stare\" sounds  a little bit like a threat.   So you kind of went off the rails there.

Part of me was like \"good job, stranger danger\" but it was also a little sad.", "Same! I think gender matters a lot, though. I feel like women aren't seen as a threat as much as men are.", "All she did was ask him to stop. How is that escalating anything?", "We experience this often with my BIL. He's neuro disabled and can sometimes take conversations too far, but we also have to be hyper-vigilant about who he talks to and what he says. I'm constantly aware of when he talks to children because he likes to say things like, \"Hey, cutie!\" My heart drops every time because I know some parents will see that as a predator talking to their child. In reality, he just relates more to children than adults.", "I guess because I work in child welfare and often have to work with parents/caregivers who have done some awful things to children I felt like I was being accused of doing things that those parents have done.", "Exactly.  I was an overly chatty child and I'm just as bad as an adult, love a good natter and nothing wrong with a smile and acknowledgement in my book.  I'm 39 with three children who are just as chatty as myself.  Feel for the hubs and neighbours most days.", "Yeah the reason I described how I looked is because the grocery store parking lot has a few homeless people in the area. My actions were partly influenced with being tired of being treated as a scary large black man(I live in a majority white town) even when I am dressed nicely. Also being a person who works with abused children I guess I never wanted to be considered a person who would harm children. Lord knows in certain situations it does make it difficult having to work with someone who has abused a child. Neglect, not as bad but whenever I would get one of those horrible sexual abuse or physical abuse cases I would immediately go to my supervisor to process my feelings so I could effectively work with the parent(s)", "Guess I should have been more clear with persisted. What I meant is after I explained the situation(little girl stared so I waved) she continued to pretty much accuse me of something untoward. Mind you I work with abused and neglected children so it really caught me off guard to be basically accused of something that I work daily to prevent", "I felt bad about that all day. I was not really in the best mindset as I was kept up to 4am by a neighbor playing loud music and then when I was on my way to the dump somehow forgot that it is Tulip season and tons of visitors(ie crazy traffic) were in my city. I live right off the exit so it took me 30 minutes to go somewhere that would usually only take about 10 then the added pressure of getting the groceries and getting back home to cook in time for my family.", "That's true. No one thinks twice about a woman being friendly with children.", "Because it was a nothing situation. Kids like to interact with people. As a parent of a similar aged kid, I would engage with my own kin and tell them to stop, not a stranger.", "It was more than just one ask, says so in the post\n\nThis comment from op for further detail\n\n>Guess I should have been more clear with persisted.

Some of the kids were helping to gather answer papers, tally scores, etc.  People were having fun and laughing.  A girl probably around 12 or so came to pick up our sheet and said something that I turned into a dad joke.  It was corny for sure but in no way creepy or mean.  My son laughed.  She looked at me like I had been cat calling her on the street.  It honestly sucks.", "I can totally understand how upsetting it was for you.", "At least the child is too young for it to bother her, so I do think it\u2019s a matter of saying the wrong thing to the adult, and not anything that affected the kid directly in any way.", "That sucks! My fiance doesn't enjoy being around kids sometimes because of this. He makes sure he's not around children without their parents. It's not because he'll do anything. It's because when society sees a man with a small child, they think the worst. I get that stuff happens to kids, and it's terrible, but the majority of people aren't going to hurt children. My BIL would never do anything to harm a child, but we still have to peel him away from kids sometimes because he gets excited that they understand him and laugh at his jokes.", "NTA, it\u2019s pretty normal to smile and wave at a child. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "NTA. I do the same thing. Kids are funny and they laugh.", "YTA.  \n\n\"The mother paused, shot me a dirty look, then said \"can you stop waving at my daughter\" I explained thst her daughter was staring at me so I was trying to be polite to her. She persisted and eventually I lost my patience and said \"maybe you should teach her not to stare\" AITA?\"\n\nThe mother very clearly let you know she was uncomfortable with your interaction with her daughter.  Rather than respect the mother's feelings, you gave a snarky response.  Whether the mother was justified or not isn't the issue, the fact of the matter is you reacted as if your interaction with the child was more important than the mother's protective instincts.", "Nta.  But, dressed as described, any parent may be wary. Also, parents are weird these days, so it's best just to acknowledge her protest and move on.", "NTA\n\nSmiling an waving is normal and expected with kids!\n\nThat said, in your shoes I would go with 'suit yourself'/ 'no problem' and ignore the kid; because you never know what a kid went through and better safe than sorry. I try not to argue with parents with little kids present if it can be avoided.\n\nI wouldn't have expanded or explained unless the mother kept going after that.\n\nMy daughter waves and smiles at a homeless guy that's usually on our way to daycare, he always smiles and waves at her and she started doing it back a couple of weeks ago. Today at the grocery store 4 different people said something to her. I don't see anything weird with that!", "NTA", "NTA (except maybe the last comment ;)..) but neither is the mom. Unfortunately, women are often scared in general if men and adding in mama-bear protectiveness? Just let her be. Most men do not understand the constant fear women live in and vulnerability.  Sucks for you if you\u2019re a genuinely nice person but just let her be.", "Majority of \"stranger danger\" activities are done by people you know unfortunately. OP NTA", "Indeed I'm sure that most don't.", "I wish that would have been the way I handled it. I am married with 5 children, I was busting my ass to get my work done for the day(dump run and cleaning the garage), finish shopping, then get back home to cook for my family.", "I did not say that. You put words in my mouth. What I was conveying to that person is that after I explained why I waved and smile the parent kept going on and making it seem to be that I was doing something untoward. Now imagine how you would feel if someone basically accused you of posing danger to their child specifically in a small town in a public place. Not to mention I work for my State's child welfare agency", "Learn to read, I said OP made that comment", "Wow! I am OP. Now how do you feel knowing you just made a comment about reading skills?", "NTA. First thank you for your service! Second, assuming you\u2019re a man, I can\u2019t blame her for being a little over protective. Unfortunately we live in a time where literally ANYONE can be a threat even at the grocery store :/ \n\nGood response though, not too rude but just enough for her to realize \u201cmaybe this guy isn\u2019t a total creep\u201d \n\n(Also anyone can be scary & a kidnapper no matter the gender but as a younger woman, I could at least physically fight off another woman better than I could a man. Def couldn\u2019t fight of a navy vet either way but would be less cautious about a woman waving to a child)", "Nta.", "If you were a woman I doubt this would even be an issue. NTA", "NTA, I love it when people smile and wave at my daughter instead of just ignoring her when she smiles and waves at them (I don\u2019t get mad if they don\u2019t acknowledge her it\u2019s definitely their choice to do so or not but it\u2019s good for her)", "NTA bet she\u2019ll turn around and complain that men aren\u2019t affectionate enough fathers.", " As a man I am so sorry that you and other women rightfully feel unsafe. I was an only child of a single mother. I remember hearing her get beat by my stepfather and one of my clearest memories is her toeprint in her own blood in the upstairs on the landing. Still there til this day, 30 years later. Some other things happened(to me) but this made me want to be a protector hence my time in the military and subsequent employment as a child welfare social worker.", "I mean if you're gonna get weird about people waving at your toddler in public - especially when the kid waves first - just don't take your kid out in public. That's the natural reaction a lot of people have. I'm sorry but some things are ridiculous to get upset about. This is one of those things.", "And you know what, I bet you if it was a woman that smiled and waved at her, the mother wouldn't have said a word.\n\nSeriously, society these days sickens me. I go for walks daily. I walk on the sidewalk, a public one. This mother one day tells me to \"stop walking by her house to creep on her son.\" I'm like 'lady. What in the hell are you talking about? Hey Jake, hold on a second -takes out airpod-. I'm on a public sidewalk, walking. That's literally what it's for, walking on. I've never interacted with your son in any way, shape, or form. Kindly see yourself inside and I'll see myself on my way now. Sorry Jake, what did you say? -reinsert airpod and kept walking-'. \n\nThere's creeping, then harassment, then there's just being a kind person. It's a damn wave. Jesus. \"Oh my God, STRANGER DANGER EVERYWHERE!\" Then stay home, order your groceries, and keep your kid a hermit like yourself. Christ. \n\nNTA.", "Which I get to an extent but if we aren't careful we'll go in the complete opposite direction and create a population of men that's anti-social. It's the fault of shitty men, but we are walking on eggshells in day to day interaction anymore.", "Like I said, OP was fine to smile and wave.  The issue was when he argued back after the mom asked him to stop.", "It clearly wasn't a nothing situation to this mother. We don't know the actual age of that child or anything about what they've got going on. Most toddlers are already chaotic, authority-defying little snots, so we don't know that trying to tell the kids to not stare would actually accomplish shit. Regardless, I don't understand what was so bad about telling OP to stop. Why can't you tell a stranger \"stop interacting with my child\"? What wasn't that the end of the conversation?", "I'm sorry but some things are damn unreasonable to get upset about. He's waving at the kid there's nothing wrong with that. It's a harmless interaction. And he only told her to tell the kid not to stare after she refused to accept that his waving was innocuous.", "\nSorry OP, but they're quoting your reply to u/Swirlyflurry", "Yes but taken all out of the original meaning. I said she persisted. Not me. I offered one explanation and she kept going on basically accusing me of something. That was the point I lost my cool and said the thing I regret. Not trying to be a smart aleck but does this succintly explain?", "Oh I see, I think we're confused because u/benjm88 's original comment seemed to be defending you and using the quote to expand upon how the mother seemed to have been escalating.", "I think I need to let this whole situation go. This has been bothering me since it happened. I'm not typically one to hold on to perceived slights but the lady was intimating that I was the very thing that I spend my day to day working against."]}
