I am trying to see his perspective in the best light - that he wants to provide support and assurance when he can see you're irritated with something and hugging feels like the best way to do it, but honestly now that you've said that's not how you want to be comforted, he shouldn't just be holding firm and saying \"Well that's how I do it\".

You're not the same person, therefore he needs to respect who you are too, especially when it comes to deciding when you want to be touched. That's bodily autonomy and he has no right to deny that to you regardless of what kind of person he is.", "NTA, so he can do mean or patronizing. That's not a great selection", "\u2026\u2026NTA and I think you backed down too quickly. \n\nHe immediately goes to an unfair generalization. \u201cI guess if I can\u2019t do anything I want I should just be mean and condescending\u201d \n\n\u2026meanwhile you *aren\u2019t allowed* to express anything but contentment. \n\nHe knows you don\u2019t want the hug. Does it anyway? That\u2019s a controllable response. \n\nThe hugging isn\u2019t \u201cwho he is\u201d. \n\nCondescending and selfish may be \u201cwho he is\u201d. \n\nYou have a good sense of who you are. I wouldn\u2019t accept this", "Nah it seems like you\u2019re both seeing the worst of intentions from each other. I think some counselling will help you both explain your intentions and wants. I am not touchy feely but I have friends who enjoy physical comfort and they want to physically comfort me when I am distressed to help and show empathy. It hurts them to see me upset and not hug me. I dislike it but I know it is done with the best intentions so I go easy on them and the continue my bitching about a situation. \n\nIf after that it doesn\u2019t change I think you should move on.", "Maybe you\u2019re both on the spectrum and communicating and interpreting social cues or boundaries are off on both sides \ud83e\udd37", "Yeah. You are putting him down and some day when you want hugs you may not get them.", "Are you on the spectrum?", "NAH.  this communication is what was needed.", "I feel its more to shut her up than be nice. He only does it when she displays emotions he doesnt like AFTER she has told him not to. NTA op but i wouldnt be ok if my partner did this to me.", "\u2026did you just skip half the post or", "It took me a while to learn that my girl isnt a touchy person. If shes upset and seems to be needing a hug then ill give her one. Im completely fine with her holding my pinky in public so i dont wander off and get lost", "Next he'll be dismissing her feelings claiming it's PMS", "And yet he\u2019s the authority on how someone should accept love \n\nYikes", "Be extremely wary. Pushing you to believe that unhappiness with his actions is actually your problem, is the hallmark of an abuser. He may not be that, but that sense of entitlement and manipulation is certainly concerning.", "She said she \"feels\" he's being dismissive by hugging her. Some people touch to show \"I'm here, I'm listening\". She doesn't want that.  Completely fair. However to him touching might mean exactly what I said earlier and her saying \"don't touch me\" is coming across as \"be cold and distant\". Two people non-verbally speaking at cross purposes. Thus counseling to see if that's the problem. Or if their love languages are incompatible.", "You were just dying to say bangmaid!", "What??? Reaching much? Hugging someone who is upset is a pretty normal response for most of us.", "He is literally touching her after she revoked consent. I don't care how he interprets it, you don't fucking do that.\n\nHe shouldn't need counseling to know not to touch someone after they asked him not to!\n\nAnd escalating from \"I don't like to be hugged when I'm mad\" to \"You want someone to be mean to you\" is insane. He's purposefully not listening to her and constructing a straw man for her to argue against to shut down her complaints about his behavior. This is pretty standard \"Oh you don't like when I do this? Then I'm not going to do anything!\" manipulation.\n\nHe's a manipulative AH (who OP has said refuses to get counseling/therapy together).", "Like, have you **seen** her other posts?\n\n>If I don't like something it's because I \"want a man whose mean to me\" so I find myself just apologizing or saying thank you for things I don't want or need lest he keep trying to push this narrative that I somehow dont know how to receive love when I don't want to be loved like that, I wasn't listened to, or feel like I need to be shiny and happy all the time.\n\n>It's not just the hug. He will actively try to shush me or hey hey, tone police me when I'm not even upset. I'm just talking.\n\nThis is not some man who is just miscommunicating. He is actively shutting her down and not listening to her.", "No, I didn't. I was just going off what was posted in the main comment jesus. I'll go commit ritual seppuku while screaming out how evil I am.", ">I'll go commit ritual seppuku while screaming how evil I am\n\nAh, I see the real reason you think he isn't an AH, you do the same thing. Instead of admitting wrong or taking in new information about a situation, you deflect by making an exaggerated straw man.", "Except she didnt even get a minute into her rant before he hugged, essentially stopping her. He knows it shuts her up so he uses it. Id be pissed.", "It makes sense if you consider the goal of the hug is to stop her venting. Like he knows she hates it and it throws her off yet he still does it."]}
