I am trying to see his perspective in the best light - that he wants to provide support and assurance when he can see you're irritated with something and hugging feels like the best way to do it, but honestly now that you've said that's not how you want to be comforted, he shouldn't just be holding firm and saying \"Well that's how I do it\".

I think you missed a few things, because I've never heard of a partner that was okay with ignoring consent requirements for physical contact.", ">e. I've asked him before not to do it, especially if I'm processing something real-time. Sometimes, I just need to get it out. if I need a hug, I will simply ask.  \n>  \n>This time I told him a bit more firmly to stop and how much it frustrates me because it seems like I'm unable to display any emotions other than joy. He said well you seemed irritated today and like you needed to cool down.\n\nShe did ask him to stop. She explained it to him. He belittled her. You did not read the post because your advice she already carried out and she got insulted for it.", "None of the love languages state the ignoring a partners direct and explicit request is acceptable.", "You have a partner who doesn't believe in therapy while you yourself are ASD. I think you have a fundamental problem with your relationship here even beyond how he is ignoring your explicit request and withdrawn consent. Normal relationships don't have someone ignoring their partner. Good partners actively want to respect a partners wishes.", "I think you've got bigger problems than the unwanted hugging, but I definitely see the connection", "Yeah, that is not someone you should be trying to have a relationship with. He is so freaked out by you acting like anything other than a happy golden retriever puppy that he can't endure anything else, no matter how calm, without taking action to make it stop.\n\nJust no. Get out of there. That is not a reasonable expectation for him to put on you, nor is it a reasonable way to handle whatever his own issue is.", "What the hell with that escalation!! What is wrong with you??", "The boyfriend was told specifically, directly and explicitly to stop and he belittled her with a stawman argument. There is an AH.", "Ok, I understand that you feel it's rude, avoidant and dismissive.  The question is, is he intending to be rude, avoidant and dismissive?  Or is he intending to be comforting and supporting?\n\nIf the first, you should break up with him, he's not right for you.  If the latter, you should break up with him, because he's not right for you.", "HE escalated. She expressed an emotion, he interrupted that expression then said something super fucked up in order to control her. \n\nThis isn't surface level. This is deeply fucked up. OP has expressed that this is a pattern. He basically said that if she can't be happy around him all the time, she doesn't deserve a person around her who treats her well.", "Intentions only matter a certain amount. First and foremost, anyone is allowed to without any repercussions withdraw consent for physical contact whenever they feel uncomfortable or just because they want to. Why are you shaming someone for doing this?", "It's not minor to belittle and degrade someones feelings while ignoring them, particularly a romantic partner.", "It's fair to not want him to hug you in these moments but are you assuming his intentions here or do you know he's trying to shut you for his sake? Could it just be that it's a habit he's having a hard time breaking in order to adapt to your needs?", "This sounds like boyfriend likely feels anxious/uncomfortable when others display big emotions, and is using hugs/shushing to comfort but also avoid and shut down those emotions early. It is possible that he has learnt to view any negative emotions as bad and undesirable, and doesn\u2019t really have the tools to \u2018sit with\u2019 bigger emotions. This is not the healthiest coping mechanism, and seems to clash heavily with how you prefer to process your emotions. \n\nIt\u2019s probably cliche at this point, but therapy could definitely help, but there are often sadly different barriers. \n\nI would heavily recommend that in addition of communicating what not to do (don\u2019t hug and shush me when I\u2019m upset), also explicitly discuss what he could do instead to be more supportive. Going from giving active hugs & verbalising shushing, to \u2018do nothing\u2019 by just listening is can be too big and quick of a change for successful follow-through. When we are told not to do something but not given an alternative, we often tend to default back to old patterns. \n\nExample: \u2018I need a listening ear when I\u2019m upset, and usually feel so much better after I\u2019m able to get it all out. When I\u2019m stopped early it makes me feel so much worse. Maybe hold my hand instead of a hug when I need to vent. Also, sympathetic nods and verbal agreement like \u2018he didn\u2019t\u2019, \u2018that was a horrible thing to say!\u2019 can really make me feel my feelings are validated and heard, and help so much!\n\nWork together, communicate and problem solve what he could do instead. See if you can figure out a system that lets you process your feelings the way you need, whist boyfriend also has an outlet to show his support.", "Well, that shows that he is doing it for his own needs. He doesn't wanna listen to you when you need to vent, and the shushing is like criticism......He sounds selfish. I would be extremely annoyed by all this if I were you. NTA, obviously"]}
