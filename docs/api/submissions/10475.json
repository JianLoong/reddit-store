A few words of comfort would have cost you nothing", "NAH. \n\nSo first and most obvious- you are not required to help your sister with her child, particularly to give up parts of your life in order to do so. Sure, it would be nice to watch the baby for like an hour so she can finish an application or whatever, but not give up sports or sacrifice your educational or social life. And I also get your frustration with her in general, and in this instance where she was having a meltdown and blaming you. \n\nNow less obvious is that I don't think your sister is an AH either, I think she is a young adult facing the consequences of her choices, and this is a big, complicated choice, and big, scary consequences. I think she made bad choices, but I can't fully get to a place where I think she is an AH, but the closest I can get is because she lashed out at you, as opposed to just being upset in general. \n\nThis is a good moment for your parents- not you- to give her some grace. So she is fully experiencing the consequences of having a child, so it might be a good time for your parents to offer her support- what educational opportunities are still open to her, how can they help, maybe some therapy would be good for her, etc. \n\nAnd you, well you can go to her and say that you understand that she got really bad news and was upset, and you are sorry (sorry like you feel bad for her, not sorry like it is your fault) she didn't get in to colleges, that you love her and can be a shoulder to cry on, but she can't yell at you like she did, because this isn't your fault, at all.", "NAH - it's a sucky situation. I think you lack empathy for your sister's situation, and I think she is unfairly projecting her situation onto you. While it might be true that this is a situation of her own making, it doesn't mean that you had to be the one to deliver that message. Of course it's a ridiculous notion that you need to give up aspects of your life to care for her child, but your sister is clearly stuck and probably despairing over not having much of a future.

I was a two sport  varsity athlete in highschool who took almost all AP/honors classes and was involved in two clubs. I am not kidding when I say that every chunk of time in my week was blocked off with practice, obligations, or homework. The only free time I had one afternoon a week went into my third sport which was outside of the school. \n\nI'm not complaining about this because it was my choice. I wanted to be involved with sports I loved and took difficult classes for college. OP is 16 so I'm guessing he's a Junior in highschool which is typically the busiest time for high performing students as they prep for standardized tests for college. He knows what he signed up for and isn't planning on sacrificing his future for hers. \n\nHis sister asking him to quit a varsity sport he's been playing for years is unreasonable. Helping babysit is something he can do for his family, but giving up commitments made is HIS choice. Not hers. I would've made more sacrifices for a family member in need but I also love kids and have a great relationship with my siblings. I still wouldn't  have given up my sports or cut back on classes knowing it would derail a future I worked towards for years. \n\nOP is NTA for refusing to give up his dreams for his sisters. I see no mention in your comments of the fact that his sister put no effort into school or plans for college for three years before she got pregnant. This was her responsibility and she chose a different lifestyle. I'm not judging her for it or her for choosing to keep her child, but she made those choices. \n\nYou know nothing of what OP's life and schedule is actually like. You're assuming he has time spent doing nothing and also saying that time should be given to watching his sisters child. Helping his sister is his choice. While I would help her in his situation, him choosing to maintain his plans does not make him TA. \n\nThe father of her baby has far more responsibility in this scenario yet you're saying OP is the one at fault? There are plenty of other people who could've supported his sister, OP is not the reason for her struggles. Why should her brother give up his limited time for a child he didn't create instead of the actual father of that child? I hope you're a troll for being this obtuse and focusing on villanizing OP.", "Where are the parents? Wheres the child father? Why force a child to look after someone else"]}
