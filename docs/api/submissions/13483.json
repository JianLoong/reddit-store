How dare they expect you to buy extra different groceries than you would feed your children to feed their child.", "NTA especially as you rearranged the play date times so Beth is not there for dinner.

Don\u2019t let the other parents make you feel guilty.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed her exactly like her parents do. When you go over to someone's house as a kid, it's a given that you'll be eating what is served, especially if the other kids are eating it, too.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing it right. I get that kids may not like some foods due to taste, texture looks etc. But roast chicken is a pretty neutral choice. (Unless you are vegan of course). I notice no mention of reciprocity in your post. These people sound horrible.", "NTA. Food preferences aside, I have never heard of any parent demanding a playdate through dinner. They must be using you as a babysitter. How rude!", "NTA. You're not required to host a playdate for dinner if you don't want to and if Beth needs special food, she needs to eat at home where she has it.

I can totally understand if they kid had allergies or was autistic. But if your kid is super picky like this you need to give others a heads up and NOT expect the other parents to foot the bill,  send the nuggets if they are that picky.

Here pickiness is rather extreme and accomodating it sounds like a lot of extra work.", "NTA. You have made reasonable accommodations for the child.", "NTA, Granted I'm a little biased here, because I was raised in a home where you eat what is put on your plate and if you don't like it, you know where the peanut butter and jelly is. Additionally, I don't understand this obligation to make playdates around dinner time? Parents need to feed their own children.", "NTA, but this could've been avoided with better communication between you and Beth's parents before the first dinner and then made accommodations either for Beth's food preferences or decided from the beginning not to have playdates that involve dinner.", "NTA. As a mom, I so want to believe this isn't real (really? can't have penne because why? Same ingredients as farfalle. Same exact taste.) The 'you should keep nuggets in your freezer' was over the top. As the mom of a kid who is fairly picky, I can honestly say that telling someone else to stock food for my kid never crossed my mind. (I did warn other parents that he's picky and we can come and get him before dinner or said \"don't worry if he doesn't eat, we'll feed him later\".) We can't control our kids' preferences, but we can give them guidelines about what to expect at other people's homes and how to behave; it sounds like Beth didn't get that. For them to disallow the kids to play together is silly-- they still will at school. Give them time to cool off, they felt their parenting was attacked in some way. FWIW, when I was teaching preschool, this kind of kid usually ended up controlling the parents because they are afraid of meltdowns/kid being upset with them. Imagine being afraid of your kid having negative feelings...Beth may not be such a great influence as she gets older.", "NTA, your house, your rules. \u201cYou eat what we serve, or you don\u2019t eat\u201d is common.

You don't get to be picky at someone else's house and make demands. The entitlement in some people.\n\nIf she or they have a problem with it, they can pack her lunch.", "NTA. You already went above and beyond to try and accommodate her. Her parents are being unreasonable and are honestly setting the girl up for failure in the future. My parents raised me the same way you\u2019re raising your kids when it comes to food. This approach is probably the reason why I love food and will try anything. I know many people my age (mid twenties) who grew up picky and were catered to with \u201ckid food\u201d by their parents, and it really becomes problematic when they become adults. They\u2019re too scared to try anything and are a pain to go out to eat with.", "NTA. Beth's parents can't reasonably expect every hosting household to cater to preferences - allergies, of course, but preferences? How on earth will the child be prepared to handle dinner parties as an adult if she's unprepared in this extreme. Or restaurants? Or the first time her new boyfriend cooks her dinner? If it ever gets that far... \n\nPicky eating of this order becomes problematic. She's eight and should be learning to adapt somewhat. I wouldn't expect her palate to love some of what you prepare, but trying isn't a bad thing, ever.", "NTA. Your position isn't unique; many families have the same approach of making one meal for everyone. You're not operating a restaurant. Your approach may have been a little strong. I would have gone a gentler route like \"she doesn't like to eat here, and I feel bad she's going home hungry. It seems easier for everyone that she eats at home.\" \n\nFor consideration: do you ever order pizza? If it's a once a month thing, maybe that's a night Beth can stay for dinner? Alternatively, if she is staying for dinner, let her parents know the menu in advance and if it's not something she'll eat, they can pack her a lunch box.", "NTA. She\u2019s not a toddler anymore - I can understand catering to picky toddlers if only for the sake of sanity, but that ship has sailed. Her parents are tacky for coming out and asking why their kid doesn\u2019t eat at your house, too, and suggesting you prepare a separate meal for their child. Maybe they should send her with food for you to pop in the microwave if it means so much to them.", "NTA.\n\nIf you had tried to force Beth to eat something she didn't want to, or if she had some sort of allergy or even a voluntary restriction (e.g., religious food restrictions), I might think differently, but you accommodated as much as reasonable, and when it became evident that reasonable accommodation weren't suitable you planned to make sure her parents could provide as they wished.  That's all you can be asked.\n\nThe reaction by Beth's parents is what makes them the assholes here - making demands of you and using \"choice words\" is not acceptable adult behavior. If they want to break up their daughter's friendship, you can't stop them, but you certainly do not need to cater to their whims or rudeness.", "NTA\nYou are not a restaurant. My kids are similar to yours. They have a couple things they don't like, but they will try anything at least once. Unless Beth is severely autistic, \"I only eat farfalle\" is ridiculous. I got friends whose son is similar to Beth and yeah, I've seen how he was trained to be a picky eater from the time he started on solids. Why eat dinner at home when they will buy you fries literal 30 minutes before dinner?", " NTA\n\nWhen I was a child I was just like Beth! My parents always made me separate meals as well and I wouldn\u2019t even eat a sandwich until I was in high school. \n\nMy parents never forced me to eat what I didn\u2019t like growing up so now as an adult I have had to teach myself to eat all the things i refused to eat. \n\nYou are doing Beth a favor by telling her parents this because it\u2019s hard to break out of the \u201cpicky\u201d eater mold when you are an adult. Clearly her parents need to introduce some normal food in her diet or have her see a therapist.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you attempted to accommodate a picky eater while still providing the way you normally do for your own family. If Beth's parents want her to stay at your home for dinner, a reasonable compromise would be for them to send her with a meal she'll eat that you can heat up at your house, not to demand you keep and make different food just for her visits.\n\nIf Beth were allergic instead of picky, her parents would probably not mind sending in food that is allergen-free to ensure her well-being.", "Ugh, Beth's parents suck and are raising a spoiled brat.  Seriously, penne vs. farfalle?  It's the same exact food in a different shape.  And they expect you to bow to their parenting without any respect for yours?  You seem to have found a good middle ground where the girls get to be friends and Beth gets to eat what her (entitled, asshole) parents feed her.\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd you're braver than I am, using voice to text.", "NTA\n\nThe only assholes in this situation are Beth parents expecting you to provide special food for her impossible standards. \n\nIf they know she is this picky they could pack her a meal for her to eat a your house, which is what most people with selective diets do.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. They shouldn\u2019t expect you to cater to their child that refuses to eat real food. They need to be the ones getting her to try new things instead of you just \u201cgiving her some chicken nuggets\u201d while your kids eat what you cooked.", "NTA.  You are not starving the child.  Plain noodles was a great compromise, and even that didn't work.", "NTA. Her parents are insane to think the rest of the world will cater to her. They should send her with dinner if it\u2019s so important that she eat dinner with her.", "NTA.\n\nI was a very picky kid at home.  My best friend's parents watched me every single day during the summers and school breaks.  I could eat what they made, and have dessert, or I could have an apple. I also had to try a bite of everything.  My dad was a chef but I credit them with teaching me guest etiquette.", "Dude, my whole family was a range of picky eaters and my parents never made us a separate meal from what they had.\n\nNTA. If it was a health (allergies, intolerances, etc) or a religious/cultural thing I'd hope anyone would accommodate a kid. But not eating b/c you don't like the noodle shape? I can't understand that.", "This one I really went back and forth on a bit, because I AM that parent that makes two separate meals and I am also that parent that has witnessed my picky 8 year old turn into a teenager that now eats anything/everything and has no issues trying new things. I think that is because altho I did not make him eat what I served, I always made him try one bite and then would give him nuggets or whatever.\n  \nBut I decided to go with NTA for the pasta comment. I have a stepdaughter(10)  that is very similar to Beth and while I love that little girl, I internally cringe when I know she is coming to visit because her mom has ruined that childs palette. She will essentially only eat McDonalds, Chef Boyardee, kraft mac & cheese cups & crab. CRAB. She has told me several times how much my homecooked meal sucks- because I'm italian and will NOT have chef boyardee in my house, i made a real sauce, didn't like it. Homemade mac n cheese, didn't like it, etc.  So keep on keepin on mamma, i think you are doing  a good job!", "Nta concerning the food part at all and I wouldn\u2019t say YTA to the last part bc the parents were rude and need to understand that you just don\u2019t do what they do. Now ofc kids can be picky eaters I have one myself, heck she won\u2019t even eat the fun Dino oatmeal I just made for her. But I will say your daughter and Beth shouldn\u2019t get the brunt necessarily for those circumstances, I suggest tou keep the dinner cut off but to maybe speak to them and say your daughter adores Beth and it would be a shame for them to lose out. say that the dinner cut off time is reasonable because their kid needs to eat dinner and that is their responsibility not yours, if they still want to demand you respect them and not respect you than you can\u2019t help the situation and it\u2019s really not your doing at that point. I had parents  that were so entitled, to the point that I was never valid bc they were, if you think Beth is otherwise a lovely child and a good friend to your girl I would say just try to see if there is a middle ground.  sucks when parents are awful and kids have to be in the middle of it. I would say that (with out implying they are awful ofc) and hey this is just what I would do and don\u2019t hold it against you if you don\u2019t feel up to it.\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to afford her food and allow your kids teachings to be undone.

Especially if they cussed you out over it.", "NTA Parents who make separate kid food meals are infuriating. They are setting their kids up to have food pickyness issues and are just making more work for themselves and everyone else who has the misfortune of cooking for their children. It is rude and ungrateful to refuse a meal prepared for you unless you have an actual allergy.", "NTA. If they choose to end the girls' friendship over something so petty, that's on them. \n\nGrowing up, we ate what we were given and at our friends' houses, we especially ate what we were given, barring any food restrictions like allergies.", "My aunt Mary was raised to have her way at meals. If if wasn't what she wanted then they would make something just to her taste. Fast forward twenty years. I am back in town with my wife for my high school reunion.

Nothing on the menu suited her, she made the waitress job a hell trying to get special requests of things not even on the menu then got rude, told us not to tip. Never going to a restaurant with her again. Very embarrassing.", "\"pizza with no sauce\"\n\nI understand Beth's food preferences aren't exactly on trial here but that's just wrong.\n\nAnyway, that aside.\n\nNTA, it's up to the parents to help develop Beth's taste to beyond snack food and it seems like they were using you to not have to worry about cooking (Or what they count as cooking) Beth dinner.

One thing I will note though, is that pickiness often does have reasons (like sensory for example) and tends to follow patterns. Her parents are doing her a huge disservice by not identifying these patterns and attempting to make variable meals within this framework. It is possible to expand the palette, and alter foods to make them \"edible\" while still existing within the framework, and doing this can challenge the \"picky\" eater in positive ways.

It didn't get diagnosed until I was an adult. I'm actually a pretty adventurous eater now, but I'm still bizarrely picky about texture. Thankfully I'm a good cook and so is my bf, so I can eat great and cater to my texture issues. Honestly though I still literally can't eat something if it triggers my texture issues, like I can no more force my body to accept some things as food than I could force myself to eat cat poop, my brain and stomach both refuse to accept it as edible no matter how much I try to force it. I spent 3 months trying to brute force myself into being able to eat eggs last year and my bf finally pulled that plug on that after 3 months of watching me gag and dry heave every morning choking them down. \n\nIf your daughter's friend isn't otherwise a spoiled brat there is probably an actual reason she js so picky with food. It's completely fair to ask her parents to send something she'll eat, but its pretty jerky to blame the kid like it's something wrong with her personality. Also your kid isn't going to suddenly revert to only eating chicken nuggets because you feed her friend things she'll eat.

My mom and brother liked the same types of things and I'm a \"super taster\" and food was rarely to my taste.

When my kids were little, I actually made meals for them that were like saut\u00e9ed fish and green beans that they loved when I didn't want to eat it, so I made more \"kid friendly\" food for myself and they were out there eating fish and mussels and steamed broccoli and whatever. \n\nAlso, don't be surprised if your kid's tastes change.
