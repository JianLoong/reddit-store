How dare they expect you to buy extra different groceries than you would feed your children to feed their child.", "NTA especially as you rearranged the play date times so Beth is not there for dinner.

Don\u2019t let the other parents make you feel guilty.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed her exactly like her parents do. When you go over to someone's house as a kid, it's a given that you'll be eating what is served, especially if the other kids are eating it, too.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing it right. I get that kids may not like some foods due to taste, texture looks etc. But roast chicken is a pretty neutral choice. (Unless you are vegan of course). I notice no mention of reciprocity in your post. These people sound horrible.", "NTA. Food preferences aside, I have never heard of any parent demanding a playdate through dinner. They must be using you as a babysitter. How rude!", "NTA. You're not required to host a playdate for dinner if you don't want to and if Beth needs special food, she needs to eat at home where she has it.

I can totally understand if they kid had allergies or was autistic. But if your kid is super picky like this you need to give others a heads up and NOT expect the other parents to foot the bill,  send the nuggets if they are that picky.

Here pickiness is rather extreme and accomodating it sounds like a lot of extra work.", "NTA. You have made reasonable accommodations for the child.", "NTA, Granted I'm a little biased here, because I was raised in a home where you eat what is put on your plate and if you don't like it, you know where the peanut butter and jelly is. Additionally, I don't understand this obligation to make playdates around dinner time? Parents need to feed their own children.", "NTA, but this could've been avoided with better communication between you and Beth's parents before the first dinner and then made accommodations either for Beth's food preferences or decided from the beginning not to have playdates that involve dinner.", "NTA. As a mom, I so want to believe this isn't real (really? can't have penne because why? Same ingredients as farfalle. Same exact taste.) The 'you should keep nuggets in your freezer' was over the top. As the mom of a kid who is fairly picky, I can honestly say that telling someone else to stock food for my kid never crossed my mind. (I did warn other parents that he's picky and we can come and get him before dinner or said \"don't worry if he doesn't eat, we'll feed him later\".) We can't control our kids' preferences, but we can give them guidelines about what to expect at other people's homes and how to behave; it sounds like Beth didn't get that. For them to disallow the kids to play together is silly-- they still will at school. Give them time to cool off, they felt their parenting was attacked in some way. FWIW, when I was teaching preschool, this kind of kid usually ended up controlling the parents because they are afraid of meltdowns/kid being upset with them. Imagine being afraid of your kid having negative feelings...Beth may not be such a great influence as she gets older.", "NTA, your house, your rules. \u201cYou eat what we serve, or you don\u2019t eat\u201d is common.

You don't get to be picky at someone else's house and make demands. The entitlement in some people.\n\nIf she or they have a problem with it, they can pack her lunch.", "NTA. You already went above and beyond to try and accommodate her. Her parents are being unreasonable and are honestly setting the girl up for failure in the future. My parents raised me the same way you\u2019re raising your kids when it comes to food. This approach is probably the reason why I love food and will try anything. I know many people my age (mid twenties) who grew up picky and were catered to with \u201ckid food\u201d by their parents, and it really becomes problematic when they become adults. They\u2019re too scared to try anything and are a pain to go out to eat with.", "NTA. Beth's parents can't reasonably expect every hosting household to cater to preferences - allergies, of course, but preferences? How on earth will the child be prepared to handle dinner parties as an adult if she's unprepared in this extreme. Or restaurants? Or the first time her new boyfriend cooks her dinner? If it ever gets that far... \n\nPicky eating of this order becomes problematic. She's eight and should be learning to adapt somewhat. I wouldn't expect her palate to love some of what you prepare, but trying isn't a bad thing, ever.", "NTA. Your position isn't unique; many families have the same approach of making one meal for everyone. You're not operating a restaurant. Your approach may have been a little strong. I would have gone a gentler route like \"she doesn't like to eat here, and I feel bad she's going home hungry. It seems easier for everyone that she eats at home.\" \n\nFor consideration: do you ever order pizza? If it's a once a month thing, maybe that's a night Beth can stay for dinner? Alternatively, if she is staying for dinner, let her parents know the menu in advance and if it's not something she'll eat, they can pack her a lunch box.", "NTA. She\u2019s not a toddler anymore - I can understand catering to picky toddlers if only for the sake of sanity, but that ship has sailed. Her parents are tacky for coming out and asking why their kid doesn\u2019t eat at your house, too, and suggesting you prepare a separate meal for their child. Maybe they should send her with food for you to pop in the microwave if it means so much to them.", "NTA.\n\nIf you had tried to force Beth to eat something she didn't want to, or if she had some sort of allergy or even a voluntary restriction (e.g., religious food restrictions), I might think differently, but you accommodated as much as reasonable, and when it became evident that reasonable accommodation weren't suitable you planned to make sure her parents could provide as they wished.  That's all you can be asked.\n\nThe reaction by Beth's parents is what makes them the assholes here - making demands of you and using \"choice words\" is not acceptable adult behavior. If they want to break up their daughter's friendship, you can't stop them, but you certainly do not need to cater to their whims or rudeness.", "NTA\nYou are not a restaurant. My kids are similar to yours. They have a couple things they don't like, but they will try anything at least once. Unless Beth is severely autistic, \"I only eat farfalle\" is ridiculous. I got friends whose son is similar to Beth and yeah, I've seen how he was trained to be a picky eater from the time he started on solids. Why eat dinner at home when they will buy you fries literal 30 minutes before dinner?", " NTA\n\nWhen I was a child I was just like Beth! My parents always made me separate meals as well and I wouldn\u2019t even eat a sandwich until I was in high school. \n\nMy parents never forced me to eat what I didn\u2019t like growing up so now as an adult I have had to teach myself to eat all the things i refused to eat. \n\nYou are doing Beth a favor by telling her parents this because it\u2019s hard to break out of the \u201cpicky\u201d eater mold when you are an adult. Clearly her parents need to introduce some normal food in her diet or have her see a therapist.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you attempted to accommodate a picky eater while still providing the way you normally do for your own family. If Beth's parents want her to stay at your home for dinner, a reasonable compromise would be for them to send her with a meal she'll eat that you can heat up at your house, not to demand you keep and make different food just for her visits.\n\nIf Beth were allergic instead of picky, her parents would probably not mind sending in food that is allergen-free to ensure her well-being.", "Ugh, Beth's parents suck and are raising a spoiled brat.  Seriously, penne vs. farfalle?  It's the same exact food in a different shape.  And they expect you to bow to their parenting without any respect for yours?  You seem to have found a good middle ground where the girls get to be friends and Beth gets to eat what her (entitled, asshole) parents feed her.\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd you're braver than I am, using voice to text.", "NTA\n\nThe only assholes in this situation are Beth parents expecting you to provide special food for her impossible standards. \n\nIf they know she is this picky they could pack her a meal for her to eat a your house, which is what most people with selective diets do.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. They shouldn\u2019t expect you to cater to their child that refuses to eat real food. They need to be the ones getting her to try new things instead of you just \u201cgiving her some chicken nuggets\u201d while your kids eat what you cooked.", "NTA.  You are not starving the child.  Plain noodles was a great compromise, and even that didn't work.", "NTA. Her parents are insane to think the rest of the world will cater to her. They should send her with dinner if it\u2019s so important that she eat dinner with her.", "NTA.\n\nI was a very picky kid at home.  My best friend's parents watched me every single day during the summers and school breaks.  I could eat what they made, and have dessert, or I could have an apple. I also had to try a bite of everything.  My dad was a chef but I credit them with teaching me guest etiquette.", "Dude, my whole family was a range of picky eaters and my parents never made us a separate meal from what they had.\n\nNTA. If it was a health (allergies, intolerances, etc) or a religious/cultural thing I'd hope anyone would accommodate a kid. But not eating b/c you don't like the noodle shape? I can't understand that.", "This one I really went back and forth on a bit, because I AM that parent that makes two separate meals and I am also that parent that has witnessed my picky 8 year old turn into a teenager that now eats anything/everything and has no issues trying new things. I think that is because altho I did not make him eat what I served, I always made him try one bite and then would give him nuggets or whatever.\n  \nBut I decided to go with NTA for the pasta comment. I have a stepdaughter(10)  that is very similar to Beth and while I love that little girl, I internally cringe when I know she is coming to visit because her mom has ruined that childs palette. She will essentially only eat McDonalds, Chef Boyardee, kraft mac & cheese cups & crab. CRAB. She has told me several times how much my homecooked meal sucks- because I'm italian and will NOT have chef boyardee in my house, i made a real sauce, didn't like it. Homemade mac n cheese, didn't like it, etc.  So keep on keepin on mamma, i think you are doing  a good job!", "Nta concerning the food part at all and I wouldn\u2019t say YTA to the last part bc the parents were rude and need to understand that you just don\u2019t do what they do. Now ofc kids can be picky eaters I have one myself, heck she won\u2019t even eat the fun Dino oatmeal I just made for her. But I will say your daughter and Beth shouldn\u2019t get the brunt necessarily for those circumstances, I suggest tou keep the dinner cut off but to maybe speak to them and say your daughter adores Beth and it would be a shame for them to lose out. say that the dinner cut off time is reasonable because their kid needs to eat dinner and that is their responsibility not yours, if they still want to demand you respect them and not respect you than you can\u2019t help the situation and it\u2019s really not your doing at that point. I had parents  that were so entitled, to the point that I was never valid bc they were, if you think Beth is otherwise a lovely child and a good friend to your girl I would say just try to see if there is a middle ground.  sucks when parents are awful and kids have to be in the middle of it. I would say that (with out implying they are awful ofc) and hey this is just what I would do and don\u2019t hold it against you if you don\u2019t feel up to it.\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to afford her food and allow your kids teachings to be undone.

Especially if they cussed you out over it.", "NTA Parents who make separate kid food meals are infuriating. They are setting their kids up to have food pickyness issues and are just making more work for themselves and everyone else who has the misfortune of cooking for their children. It is rude and ungrateful to refuse a meal prepared for you unless you have an actual allergy.", "NTA. If they choose to end the girls' friendship over something so petty, that's on them. \n\nGrowing up, we ate what we were given and at our friends' houses, we especially ate what we were given, barring any food restrictions like allergies.", "My aunt Mary was raised to have her way at meals. If if wasn't what she wanted then they would make something just to her taste. Fast forward twenty years. I am back in town with my wife for my high school reunion.

Nothing on the menu suited her, she made the waitress job a hell trying to get special requests of things not even on the menu then got rude, told us not to tip. Never going to a restaurant with her again. Very embarrassing.", "\"pizza with no sauce\"\n\nI understand Beth's food preferences aren't exactly on trial here but that's just wrong.\n\nAnyway, that aside.\n\nNTA, it's up to the parents to help develop Beth's taste to beyond snack food and it seems like they were using you to not have to worry about cooking (Or what they count as cooking) Beth dinner.

Maybe, just \u201cwe are kind to people who struggle\u201d, and \u201cwe treat guests differently than children we are responsible for raising.\u201d", "NTA. When you eat at someone else\u2019s house, you eat what is made or you don\u2019t eat at all. Unless of course it is due to something beyond your control like an allergy. You were smart to end play dates before dinner and it sounds like her parents are just mad they can\u2019t have dinner on their own anymore. I was a very picky eater as a kid and I never once expected separate accommodations, nor did my parents. I always found something to eat.", "Who they also find annoying for being so damn picky! They got nerve! They were trying to make their problem OP\u2019s problem!", "Now they can't go to nice restaurants.", "NTA! Ending play dates before dinner works", "Saut\u00e9 3 cloves of garlic and dried chili pepper to taste in olive oil. Add about a cup of white wine and let reduce. Cook your pasta Al dente and, before draining the pasta, take about a half a cup of reserve pasta water and put to the side. Toss the pasta in the garlic/wine sauce and add sea urchin. If needed to reach the desired consistency, add some of the pasta water. Toss over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley.", "True this, I was so annoyed at Beth's parents I forgot to say sea urchin rules.", "NTA! Ending play dates before dinner works perfect because it reduces your and Beth\u2019s anxiety over food.", "Exactly.", "As far as I know, Beth doesn\u2019t have any medical reason that would explain her food preferences. If she did, I would, of course try harder to accommodate her. But like you said, I don\u2019t want to waste money on food that no one in my house will eat and is reserved for an eight-year-old who doesn\u2019t live with me.", "Yeah, I can just see that package of nuggets getting freezer burn.", "I know that some of the food I make is unusual, so I try to make pretty neutral dishes when we have guests whose preferences Im not familiar with. I\u2019ve never had anyone reject roast chicken before this.", "My kiddo is autistic has AFRID, and suffers from odd food allergies. \n\nI solved this by sending some of his \"safe foods\" with him in a cooler for any play dates. Usually, it is an ensure and granola bar. \n\nThat way he didn't have the pressure of trying foods that would trigger him, and the family hosting him didn't have to worry.", "If I were OP I wouldn't want my daughter subjected to Beth's parents' idea of dinner.  Especially after \"choice words\".  I bet Beth's parents would actively try to mess with OP daughter's dining / palate / expectations / etc.", "I agree, I wish we had communicated before the first play date. However, after that first play date, Beth\u2019s parents gave me a list of what food she eats. That list wasn\u2019t specific enough, leading to the pasta debacle and other similar situations.", "This. If Beth and OP\u2019s kid do end up losing their friendship that might not be the worst thing. I\u2019ve worked with children too and Beth\u2019s parents sound exactly like you said. They are afraid of their child having any negative emotion and bend over backwards for Beth. Terrible lesson and since the world won\u2019t bend for Beth she is gonna be insufferable.", "When my nephew was 4 or 5, he wouldn\u2019t eat anything but farfalle and insisted all pastas taste different. Of course, he grew out of that fairly quickly!", "My kids had to try anything that was made for them.  If they genuinely didn't like it, we always had alternatives.  Most of the time they did.  If they tried to refuse to eat something we knew they liked, tough.", "> Your position isn't unique; many families have the same approach of making one meal for everyone.\n\nGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know any families who didn\u2019t have the \u201cone meal for everyone\u201d approach. I was totally taken aback when I had kids and found out that so many of their friends were served \u201ckids food\u201d at home. I had no idea that was a thing. I\u2019m not sure if this a generational thing or a difference in the community I grew up in versus the one I live in now.", "Forgot to respond to the rest of your comment. I do order pizza! Beth\u2019s no sauce on pizza preference complicates things but we have done that before. I\u2019m willing to do that as long as it\u2019s not for every play date.", "> your daughter and Beth shouldn\u2019t get the brunt necessarily for those circumstances\n\nI completely agree and this is the main reason why I feel I may be the asshole. I think Beth\u2019s parents are ridiculous but, at the same time, I don\u2019t want my actions to affect my kid\u2019s friendships.", "Pizza with no sauce is a thing, actually. And quite tasty.", "Why? Grilled octopus and sea urchin are both awesome. My favorite food growing up was steamed clams and mussels. If you grow up eating certain foods often enough, you tend to prefer those foods.", "The compromise was already 1) cooking more bland foods with her in mind and 2) having her over before dinner time. When you're in someone else's house you go by their rules. This child was also picky about sauce on pizza and penne vs farfalle, so there's going to be no pleasing her without cooking a completely seperate meal.", "I was thinking this until I got to \u201cBeth refused to eat penne because she only eats farfalle\u201d. That\u2019s excessive. That\u2019s overtly picky and OP is never gonna win. It would be the wrong kind of nuggets or something.", "I agree with this. Maybe the OP's daughter has so many friends that this one isn't really important to her, but I just can't understand why a bag of chicken nuggets she can throw in the freezer and the girls can have on occasion when Beth comes over is that big of a deal. Friendships are so important at this age. Kids love sleepovers at this age, none of which you can do if your friend has to go home because you won't serve kid friendly food. Seems like cutting off the nose to spite the face to me.", "Got any explanation?", "Sounds delicious except for the parsley.  I want to go back in history and find whoever made that a thing.  And then history would have one less entry.  With extreme prejudice.", "Beautiful! Thank you!", "You aren\u2019t in the wrong at all. I have a friend who has picky eaters. Every time they come over my friend *brings them food*. Like we don\u2019t keep ketchup in the house (my partner and I think it\u2019s gross) and one of their daughters won\u2019t eat half the food she will eat without it. My friend bought a thing of ketchup for my house, she made sure it was okay to keep in the bottom shelf. \n\nI might not agree with her catering to her kids, but at least *she is the one catering*. She never expects me or my family to cater to her kid\u2019s preferences. She still encourages them to try what we make and since they see everyone else eating it they usually will, and occasionally they find something new they like. Beth\u2019s parents are failing her. Imo.", "Yeah I have a very picky kid (he\u2019s 4, it\u2019s allowed) and he would eat roast chicken (white meat, no skin). He also often goes to friends houses and is offered stuff and just\u2026 doesn\u2019t eat it and is fine. Even if you offered him a super safe food (pizza, etc) he\u2019d probably have 2 bites because he\u2019s not good at eating around other kids (too exciting, we are working on it, lol). And that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t expect anyone to make accommodations for him.", "NTA. I had 1/3 who was a picky eater, but we didn't cook her a separate meal. She ate what she liked, mostly the sides cuz she's not a fan of meat. She's expanded her food horizons, but still only eats boneless chicken, ground beef, and bacon.", "You\u2019re NTA but what else do you make for your kids? My 8m eats like me, thank god. But my 3f is texture picky. She doesn\u2019t like meat like I did as a child lol so i have to get creative", "I have -- and these were adults! I had knocked myself out making a meal for my parents-in-law. Roast Cornish game hen with Shaker bread stuffing. Rice pilaf cooked in chicken broth with slivered almonds and sesame seeds. Green beans fresh from my garden. Salad, also fresh for my garden. Mushrooms in sour cream. They each ate about two bites of chicken breast and turned up their noses at everything else. I never cooked for them again.", "yeah! I have allergies, I know as a kid my mum would tell the other parent before we went on a play date, if they weren't ok feeding me, then we took food.  For the most part if was just easy for me to avoid the foods. (oranges and pineapple)", "Or maybe they just bring a pack of nuggies when dropping Beth at your place.", "Beth's going to have plenty of those.  I wonder if her parents will be here posting asking why Beth has a problem with them.", "Right, this is exactly what I mean. We had to try everything that my parents made. If we didn\u2019t like it, that was fine, there were other things we were welcome to eat. Obviously there are a couple foods I don\u2019t like, namely broccoli, and I was never forced to eat them after trying them a few times. But I had to give whatever they made a try first, and they would never prepare two separate meals for themselves and the kids. They also made sure we knew that when we went to friends houses for dinner, we were to either eat what they were serving, or politely decline to eat at all (which I don\u2019t think I ever did).", "It\u2019s a sheer laziness thing. Much like sticking them in front of a TV/tablet rather than interacting with them. It\u2019s just easier to heat up dinosaur shaped chicken than to try and convince them to eat something new.", "It's a matter if doing what easy for today versus what's right for the long haul. It's easy to toss some chicken nuggets at a kid to appease them in the moment. But we know it's not doing the patents or kid any favors for later.  \n\nI feel your frustration, but the flip side is you don't want to cost your daughter her friendship if a sauceless pizza can be had. Chances are next school year she'll have a new best friend who will eat regular food. Keep looking ahead.", "You're fine until they're actively undermining your parenting.  You found a way to adapt to preserve the friendship without undermining their (really stupid) parenting.", "I dunno. I'd just feel like I'm eating half a cheese sandwich.\n\nMaybe I'll give it a shot since it's rude to judge without trying it, but I'm just saying I'll be keeping my expectations low.", "I understand. I just think it's possible that we have a child who is on one end of the spectrum eating wise (only eats chicken nuggets and frozen pizza) and the OP who is far on the other end, considering sea urchin and grilled octopus are normal dinners in her house. \n\nOP is fine if she wants to die on this hill and make a stink over it, but she's already offended the other kid's family by saying their kid can't come over for dinner. This would also exclude sleepovers if OP won't compromise and serve kid friendly foods even for a special occasion. If OP is okay with her daughter losing that friendship, that's fine. Perhaps her daughter has lots of friends and won't miss this one, and the other kids love being served what the OP cooks...", "Exactly.  I was on OP's side anyway, but the farfalle vs. penne thing just sent me over the top.", "I'm not arguing that the child is excessively picky. If the OP is fine with her daughter losing this friendship and has plenty of other friends, then by all means, she's fine sticking to her guns over the battle of the roasted chicken.", "Yeah, the commenter only eats chicken nuggets and farfalle and expect everybody to cater to them.", "Secretly the kids mom", "I'll take parsley over cilantro, that can disappear forever", "\\*laughs in ashkenazi jewish bitter herbs at the seder\\*", " But if this is their reaction then beth better get ready for a lot of temporary friends.", "My kid must have eaten your broccoli.  My older kid is much, much pickier than my younger and has always preferred plainer foods.  Think plain croissant instead of any sort of filled pastry, or carrots instead of candy.  He loved, and still loves, broccoli.  Order \"Chinese\" (you know, American \"Chinese\") food and beef and broccoli is the only thing he'll eat.  So he thanks you for making sure there was more for him.", "I felt the same way at first, I'll admit. I've found that I enjoy it without sauce from some places (too sweet for my taste) and prefer it with in others.", "What? No. The person who posted makes all kinds of food. The kid\u2019s guest is the one who only eats nuggets. You have it completely backwards", "And here I just think kale is stupid.", "It's not just that parsley is nasty tasting, it's the use as a garnish.  Just no.", "As an Indian... Please and no thank you, I love cilantro, so many dishes I feel need it with that garnish", "If cilantro is bitter to your tastebuds, that's because of your DNA. I found this out through DNA testing.", "No, you got me wrong. I said \"the commenter\" whom you asked for clarification, I didn't say \"OP\". I was basically joking that the commenter to whom you were replying was a \"Beth\". Sorry the joke didn't work.", "Agreed, and I don't feel bad about it. Spinach gives the same benefits as kale, I'll pick spinach every time\n\nWill admit, Titan A.E. (movie) made me think Kale was a cool name till I learned it's also a vegetable. Now I wonder why the dad named his son that at all", "Kale has exactly one use: zuppa toscana soup.", "It worked, I laughed.", "I love spinach."]}
