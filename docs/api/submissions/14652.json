She has Noah (12) and Ellie (9) from a previous relationship and we have Rose (4) and Jackson (9 months) together. A couple things important to mention is that my wife has another kid, Ava (14), also with her ex, that lives with her sister and that her ex moved back to his home country after the divorce and has nothing to do with the kids. \n\nShortly after the divorce (4 years ago), Ava and my wife got into an argument. Ava blamed her mom for her dad leaving and it got pretty heated. In the heat of the moment, my wife destroyed what could be described as Ava's comfort item and told Ava to get the fuck out of her house. \n\nAva ran out of the house, the police and CPS got involved, and Ava was put in foster care, then went to live with my wife's sister once she got a big enough place. My wife was ordered to go to anger management, therapy, and parenting classes. Ava was brought back to us 3 times but every time she was brought back she'd run away or raise hell until she got to stay with her aunt. My wife's sister got full custody because of that. \n\nMy wife has been trying to fix her relationship with Ava since the incident. She'd beg her sister to let her visit, sent toys to her sister's apartment, sent letters, called and texted repeatedly but Ava never answered. \n\nThey moved out of state 2 years ago and just before the move, Ava reached out to my wife just to tell her that she wants nothing to do with her and to leave her alone. My wife honored her request until recently when she was going to be in their city for work. she reached out to both her sister and Ava but got no response. She went to Ava's school to try to speak with her, which turned into a big issue and Ava and my wife's sister ended up getting a restraining order on my wife preventing her from contacting them or going near them. \n\nShe's been so upset since then, which is understandable, Ava and her aunt should've been more understanding towards my wife. I couldn't see her like that so I told her it's time to cut her losses and focus on her family now. She listened to my advice but her family, who have been pressuring her to try to fix the relationship, is calling her a bad mom and accusing her of abandoning Ava.

That was what put her in this mess in the first place, and that is still what is making trouble both for her, for Ava and for your SIL. The way she almost aggressively has insisted on getting in contact with Ava is again, crossing some deep lines. \n\nThe authorities has had to put those boundaries firmly in place (restraining order) as she cannot see them herself. She can\u2019t make Ava trust her again, and by trying to force herself into Ava\u2019s life, she is absolutely sabotaging her own intent. \n\nBut you asked if you are an AH for telling her to cut her losses. It\u2019s a hard one, but I\u2019ll say NTAH, even if I wouldn\u2019t have worded it like you did. It\u2019s not about cutting losses, but to respect Ava\u2019s boundaries and give her time and space to heal, and eventually contact your wife herself - IF and WHEN she has found the confidence, strength and will to do so. Your wife must endure not knowing if that will ever happen and respect that it may not. And to live with that, I agree with you that she should focus on being the best mom possible to the kids around her. \n \nBut even if your wife really has made a big mess, and even if she still has some issues imho, this is a big, big loss and she will need to mourn. Both the loss of Ava, but also the sorrow and shame over what she didn\u2019t do right and the person she was.

You\u2019re minimizing and glossing over a lot of traumatizing things Ava experienced, and your wife\u2019s role in traumatizing a child. \n\nYour wife is TA for her behavior. Being a parent is mostly a one way street. Regardless of Ava\u2019s behavior your wife is expected to be and act like the adult. Yes she\u2019s human, but parents are held to a higher standard\u2026 she failed Ava. No amount of parenting classes, anger management, and individual therapy is going to fix Ava. She needs to understand how much harm she caused that can\u2019t be undone.\n\nPlus the timing of all this makes you both sounds sus and sketchy AF. (But Reddit has taught me that a lot people are weirdly attracted to shitty parents and cheaters. So, while I find it morally wrong, do you Pikachu\u2026) \n\nHowever, you did ask specifically about the advice you gave her. That\u2019s where I think you\u2019re not completely the TA (but still kinda are). The only card your wife can play right now is to keep growing and leave the door open for Ava to establish a relationship on her terms (not your wife\u2019s). She shouldn\u2019t have ignored Ava\u2019s boundaries, but that\u2019s a moot point (because she already did). \n\nSo you are right that she needs to ignore her family and completely leave Ava alone. But not \u201ccut her loses\u201d instead she should love her from a distance. She can do things to prove she still thinks about Ava and cares about her in the hopes that it\u2019ll pay off in the future if they reconcile (like start  a journal where she writes letters to Ava in the hopes that she can give it to her as an adult. Or a savings account that can give to Ava when she\u2019s an adult.. I\u2019m sure Reddit has more suggestions for this). \n\nHowever this incident indicates that you both have some growing to do.

She abused her child and her behavior was reprehensible enough that a judge gave custody of the child to an aunt. Then she blatantly ignored the child\u2019s explicit request to stop contact and started stalking her. This behavior was so severe that it merited a restraining order.

The essence of your comment, that she needs to step back, focus on the family that want and need her now and leave Ava be, that's the right advice to give. It's not abandoning her, as the relatives are saying, it's respecting her wishes and giving her the kind of care she needs right now. \n\nMaybe once enough time has passed (and if it doesnt violate the restraining order), she could reach out to her sister to make sure Ava's okay, ask her to pass on the message that she loves her, she's sorry and is always ready to talk if ever that's what Ava wants.

It takes a lot for them to give that up and sever parents rights and for a court to grant full custody to a foster parent. That\u2019s the supporting evidence.", "OP was probably a contributing factor to conflict.\n\nLike to point out, OP has a four years old kid with wife, which means 4years ago when Ava and wife were having \"issues\" and wife just got divorced, baby was around or coming along. Add in the baby it will take a few months to grow and seems there was a relationship in place. \n\nAdd in OP stated in opening, they had FOUR kids but then described wife having birthed FIVE kids. OP doesn't even consider Ava one of his own.\n\nWould you want to live with the parent and their affair partner? \n\nKids need a lot of drive and determination to actively run away repeatedly which seems to have included having to cut through screen windows, which really makes me question why she couldn't just go through the door.", "I agree. And if there was abuse all of the children would have been removed, not just one.", "And I assume you\u2019re an \u201cactually\u2026\u201d kind of person in all sorts of conversations.", "Thanks for the info. What a shame, poor kids man...", "I was going to guess drugs but they didn\u2019t take the other kids.", "What she broke isn't relevant", "I know parental custody is different than an aunt, but given Ava\u2019s age would the court take her wants into consideration?", "Cps would determine where the danger is and what's best for the children individually. If it was only between the mother and one child while the rest are taken care of properly, only the one kid who's being abused would take away for their own safety since the safety of the other kids are not in question.", "Lol, what a weird thing to get you panties in a twist about", "Exactly! I 100000% agree. My husband tried to get custody of his nieces when his sister and her ex lost custody and they were doing drugs, DV, and other things and they still wanted reunion. So sad", "You have to be separated for a time before divorce in some cases", "She\u2019s in an unstable environment and feels unwanted so no wonder she was having a hard time", "Yes, she was very determined to get away from your wife.  Very, very determined.", "This comment explains so so so much and helps you not at all.", "Kids don't go into foster care for a one-time mistake.", "\"Great mom\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nShit made me choke on my morning coffee", "More than one. That's why she now has a restraining order.", "You don\u2019t lose custody over one mistake. Why don\u2019t you fill us in on the rest of the story?", "Nope. She is not a great mom. A great mom would never under any circumstance, ever, say that to their child. Let alone a 10 year old little girl who already has a lot of siblings, a lot going on within the family and a father who is already abandoned her. Nope the fuck with that. And to destroy something of hers, who is the 10-year-old?\nWhat your wife did was inflict lifelong pain on a little girl. Shame.", "You keep on telling yourself that - and make sure you remember that you said it when it inevitably happens. She showed you (and Ava) *exactly* who she is and you don't believe her. Good luck with that!\n\nYTA.", "Must\u2019ve been a hell of a mistake for CPS to step in and put the child in foster care. You\u2019re naive to think she\u2019s not going to abuse the other kids at some point, too. How many \u201cmistakes\u201d are you going to stand by and watch? Or will that only matter if she lashes out at your bio kids? \n\nWhile I do agree she needs to leave Ava alone, YTA for procreating with and remaining married to a known child abuser.", "Great moms don't get their kids taken by CPS. The system is so overloaded even terrible moms barely have their kids taken by CPS.", "The whole AITA community disagrees.", "I suspect it wasn't just a comfort item and that she actually broke Ava's arm or physically assaulted her in some way. CPS doesn't remove a child because a parent threw away a stuffed animal. Nor do the police get involved.", "What your wife broke is the most valuable thing a parent has, her child's trust. And the ONLY way it is possible for that to EVER be repaired, is to allow Ava to do it on HER OWN timeline. You CANNOT expect her to \"just hear her out, and see it from her perspective\". Your wife killed that chance then pissed all over it  by her words and actions.\n\n\nETA - it MAY NEVER HAPPEN. And that's your wife's fault. 100% your wife's fault. I'll say it again. It is 100% your wife's fault. She is the adult, she is the parent, it is not normal to have that relationship severed by CPS unless your wife is really bad. Once again, THIS IS 100% YOUR WIFES FAULT.", "Yes it is", "That bad, huh? YTA", "So she physically assaulted Ava and destroyed her things got it. Because CPS won\u2019t be involved for throwing away toys", "It's actually very relevant? I wanna know", "The things that you didn't say sounds so loud here", "At this point it is not different. The aunt fostered Ava and then the aunt was granted full custody. Moms rights were severed and aunt is the parent now.", "Whose panties are in a twist? Have the night you deserve :)", "It took my uncle multiple years of fighting to get primary custody of his youngest after his ex put his middle child in the hospital (eldest was already an adult and his ex fully gave up rights to middle kid without a fight).", "It truly is the goal. The entire children\u2019s  protection services from the social workers to judges know this~ in the US anyway~ when the goal should be~ keep the children alive and well. It\u2019s a stupid system. I don\u2019t believe this story for a second.", "No on that he's right, the item isn't relevant, what's relevant is that it was something that was comforting to her child!!! And she broke it anyways!!\n\nIt doesn't matter what the hell is going on in her life. You have no excuse, ever to abuse a child mentally, physically, emotionally or otherwise! A good parent would know that!", "Afternoon for me :) and what is up with some of y'all with the \"have the *blank* you deserve\" . It really doesn't make you sound intelligent or snarky. Stupid, really.", "Oh one of my college friends and her husband foster-adopted his great niece with all kinds of CPS hoops to jump through. It can and does happen, but jt takes a lot to get there.", "It doesn't f*ing matter what she was \"dealing with\" at the time. There's no excuse for treating a child like that.  \n\nThere's no excuse for harassing and stalking a child who doesn't want any contact either. Her sister did the right thing by getting a restraining order.", "Bro. No. You don't get violent with a ten year old and throw them out on the street, this is a absolutely vile to try defending.", "Oh, boy.  You're either sugarcoating your comments, or if you actually believe what you're saying, you're deep in denial.", "Sounds like she's 'dealing with' a lot right now. What's stopping her from abusing the rest of her kids? Will you excuse it and defend her when she does?   Which of the children will be the next that you decide should be forgotten and ignored after they don't just let themselves be abused quietly? When you're making a post on another throwaway in a few years, will you defend yourself and her with vague excuses of how the people reading then don't know \"everything she was dealing with\" in 2023?", "So were you the affair partner?", "Who freaking cares???? She's the adult, her issues are not a ten year olds problem! You are unbelievable defending the undefendable \ud83d\ude44", "Nobody gives a shit what she was dealing with because nothing gives her an excuse to abuse her child.\n\nYour wife abuses her children and has learned nothing because she\u2019s still trying to force contact to the point where they put a restraining order on her.\n\nYTA for thinking any part of this could be Ava\u2019s fault but i agree that she should leave them alone. It would be the one decent thing she could do for Ava.", "IT DOESN'T MATTER. It does not matter what was going on. She failed. Absolutely, epically, and most likely, permanently. Her family needs to let it lie, the damage is done and there is no going back. She's just traumatizing her further.", "Wow that matters\u2026 not at all. That abusive monster you call your wife is the adult in this situation. That means it\u2019s completely irrelevant what she was \u201cdealing with\u201d\u2014it\u2019s her job as the parent to emotionally regulate. Not the fucking 10-year-old\u2019s.\n\nESH", "My, my. you\u2019re super riled up. Okay kitten, go have a sweet afternoon nap", "I keep seeing she got divorced 4 years ago and the child is 4, what everyone seems to be forgetting is it takes approximately 10 months to have a baby... So she was pregnant with his child, had the baby then got divorced. Most Courts do not allow for a divorce if the wife is pregnant.\n\nEdit: left out a word", "> Then why the fuck are you here\n\nI think he needs validation that they've \"tried everything\" for reconciliation and wants at least one response to tell them \"you poor guys, you deserve better, time to completely abandon her (like you did time and time again) and move on\".\n\nOP, I will say that and even sugar coat that shit if your wife will finally leave Ava the fuck alone. She doesn't want her abuser around her, the least you can do is honor that.", "Same/similar reaction from me when the realisation hit too. OP and his wife deserve each other.", "He was there though...do the math and include the pregnancy months", "That depends on where you are. It is not a universal rule that a court won\u2019t grant a divorce if the woman is pregnant.", "\"I've tried nothing and now I'm all it of ideas, but it's totally the 10 year old who had her whole life ripped apart because mum couldn't keep it in her pants' fault\"", "My bad I thought I had put most in front of courts.", "Whoa I\u2019ve never heard that before that\u2019s crazy???\n\nEspecially because domestic violence is often started or escalated during pregnancy that seems so backwards!!"]}
