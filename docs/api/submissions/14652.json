She has Noah (12) and Ellie (9) from a previous relationship and we have Rose (4) and Jackson (9 months) together. A couple things important to mention is that my wife has another kid, Ava (14), also with her ex, that lives with her sister and that her ex moved back to his home country after the divorce and has nothing to do with the kids. \n\nShortly after the divorce (4 years ago), Ava and my wife got into an argument. Ava blamed her mom for her dad leaving and it got pretty heated. In the heat of the moment, my wife destroyed what could be described as Ava's comfort item and told Ava to get the fuck out of her house. \n\nAva ran out of the house, the police and CPS got involved, and Ava was put in foster care, then went to live with my wife's sister once she got a big enough place. My wife was ordered to go to anger management, therapy, and parenting classes. Ava was brought back to us 3 times but every time she was brought back she'd run away or raise hell until she got to stay with her aunt. My wife's sister got full custody because of that. \n\nMy wife has been trying to fix her relationship with Ava since the incident. She'd beg her sister to let her visit, sent toys to her sister's apartment, sent letters, called and texted repeatedly but Ava never answered. \n\nThey moved out of state 2 years ago and just before the move, Ava reached out to my wife just to tell her that she wants nothing to do with her and to leave her alone. My wife honored her request until recently when she was going to be in their city for work. she reached out to both her sister and Ava but got no response. She went to Ava's school to try to speak with her, which turned into a big issue and Ava and my wife's sister ended up getting a restraining order on my wife preventing her from contacting them or going near them. \n\nShe's been so upset since then, which is understandable, Ava and her aunt should've been more understanding towards my wife. I couldn't see her like that so I told her it's time to cut her losses and focus on her family now. She listened to my advice but her family, who have been pressuring her to try to fix the relationship, is calling her a bad mom and accusing her of abandoning Ava. They got a fucking restraining order so I don't know what they expect her to do but now she's upset over it again so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for my advice", "created_utc": 1681340707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k30ti/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_cut_her_losses_and/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It still sounds like she has a problem respecting boundaries though. That was what put her in this mess in the first place, and that is still what is making trouble both for her, for Ava and for your SIL. The way she almost aggressively has insisted on getting in contact with Ava is again, crossing some deep lines. \n\nThe authorities has had to put those boundaries firmly in place (restraining order) as she cannot see them herself. She can\u2019t make Ava trust her again, and by trying to force herself into Ava\u2019s life, she is absolutely sabotaging her own intent. \n\nBut you asked if you are an AH for telling her to cut her losses. It\u2019s a hard one, but I\u2019ll say NTAH, even if I wouldn\u2019t have worded it like you did. It\u2019s not about cutting losses, but to respect Ava\u2019s boundaries and give her time and space to heal, and eventually contact your wife herself - IF and WHEN she has found the confidence, strength and will to do so. Your wife must endure not knowing if that will ever happen and respect that it may not. And to live with that, I agree with you that she should focus on being the best mom possible to the kids around her. \n \nBut even if your wife really has made a big mess, and even if she still has some issues imho, this is a big, big loss and she will need to mourn. Both the loss of Ava, but also the sorrow and shame over what she didn\u2019t do right and the person she was. She\u2019ll need your support through that, but also honesty and your voice so she can start seeing those lines she shouldn\u2019t cross.

Being a parent is mostly a one way street. Regardless of Ava\u2019s behavior your wife is expected to be and act like the adult. Yes she\u2019s human, but parents are held to a higher standard\u2026 she failed Ava. No amount of parenting classes, anger management, and individual therapy is going to fix Ava. She needs to understand how much harm she caused that can\u2019t be undone.\n\nPlus the timing of all this makes you both sounds sus and sketchy AF. (But Reddit has taught me that a lot people are weirdly attracted to shitty parents and cheaters. So, while I find it morally wrong, do you Pikachu\u2026) \n\nHowever, you did ask specifically about the advice you gave her. That\u2019s where I think you\u2019re not completely the TA (but still kinda are). Firstly, they (Ava and Aunt) don\u2019t need to be more understanding. Your wife is and was the problem. The only card your wife can play right now is to keep growing and leave the door open for Ava to establish a relationship on her terms (not your wife\u2019s). She shouldn\u2019t have ignored Ava\u2019s boundaries, but that\u2019s a moot point (because she already did). \n\nSo you are right that she needs to ignore her family and completely leave Ava alone. But not \u201ccut her loses\u201d instead she should love her from a distance. She can do things to prove she still thinks about Ava and cares about her in the hopes that it\u2019ll pay off in the future if they reconcile (like start  a journal where she writes letters to Ava in the hopes that she can give it to her as an adult. Or a savings account that can give to Ava when she\u2019s an adult\u2026 I\u2019m sure Reddit has more suggestions for this). \n\nHowever this incident indicates that you both have a lot of growing to do. Your attitude and your wife\u2019s impulsive, destructive behavior is alarming. If you want to support your wife, you need to be more empathetic to Ava and STOP enabling her inappropriate/abusive behavior.

I couldn't see her like that so I told her it's time to cut her losses and focus on her family now.

She abused her child and her behavior was reprehensible enough that a judge gave custody of the child to an aunt. Then she blatantly ignored the child\u2019s explicit request to stop contact and started stalking her. This behavior was so severe that it merited a restraining order. Judges don\u2019t grant restraining orders against parents unless they\u2019re merited. I think you need to take some serious time to be honest with yourself about your wife\u2019s behavior and the deserved consequences.\n\nYou\u2019re still the asshole.

A more feeling response would have been to urge your wife to get therapy, own her mistakes, and work towards earning a relationship with her daughter.

The essence of your comment, that she needs to step back, focus on the family that want and need her now and leave Ava be, that's the right advice to give. It's not abandoning her, as the relatives are saying, it's respecting her wishes and giving her the kind of care she needs right now. \n\nMaybe once enough time has passed (and if it doesnt violate the restraining order), she could reach out to her sister to make sure Ava's okay, ask her to pass on the message that she loves her, she's sorry and is always ready to talk if ever that's what Ava wants.

The only competition you have is the biological father. However, you mentioned that the child is with their sister and they have moved to a new location, which means a new courtroom. This could be as easy as filing. After that, you need to separate yourself from the sister and get reconciliation counseling for the child. Children have been traumatized for less than what they are claiming, and they are often forced back into the situation and have to recover from it. However, that resilience builds character, and that's why it's important to face your problems and not run away from them.\r  \n\r  \nThat being said, if there is no child support and no emotional attachment, then abandonment may be the right choice, but it should be done legally.
