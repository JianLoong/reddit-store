Hopefully this will be a lesson learned for him to set an alarm and one that will actually get him up.", "NTA\n\nHow is any of this your fault??

Your dad said so, you did nothing wrong.   End it and let your brother deal with his sleepiness.   He has a consequence.  Maybe he will learn.", "NTA, you tried to wake him up it's his complete fault, it's good his phone was taken away now maybe he'll learn to help you.", "So.... you had to get up at 7.30 to shovel outside. You had to do it all by yourself, because your brother didn't wake up. You tried to wake him up, it just didn't work. And you didn't lie about it. And now you have been up early, worked twice as hard AND you get shit for not lying about your brother waking up? \n\nYour parents sound a bit too strict, your brother sounds a bit too tired, the weather sounds nasty and NTA.", "Unless your brother has a sleep disorder, it\u2019s not that he couldn\u2019t, it\u2019s that he wouldn\u2019t. NTA The wrestling with sleep can be real at that age, but it\u2019s still nobody\u2019s fault but his own.\n\n(When I was dealing with depression, I may have sounded a lot like him. It\u2019s still his fault.)", "So you expected him to just telepathically know that he was going to get a text at 7:30am to do a chore? You were tasked with waking him up, sounds like you barely tried.  And now he\u2019s being punished unfairly by your dad and it\u2019s partly your fault, AND you had the audacity to call him names, nice. What kind of, presumably teenager, would set an alarm for 7 in the morning on what is presumably a weekend to do chores he didn\u2019t even know had to be done? YTA 100%", "INFO: Did your brother know he was required to wake up at 7.30 before going to bed?", "YTA how the hell should he know to set an alarm for something he doesn't even know about? Glad I'm not in your family.", "NTA  \nHe's the asshole for trying to pin his faults onto you. Next time you need to wake him up, just be a bit \"extra\" so he really knows that you tried hard enough.  \n\n\nFun \"extra\" examples:  \nIce down the shirt and/or pants. whatever your comfortable with doing  \nWater on face (make sure his face is not covered, you don't want to water board him)  \nRip all the blankets off of him  \nPlace a standalone alarm or bell or noise that has to be physically turned off in his room, but not within bed reaching distance. There exists a robot alarm that rolls on the ground.", "NTA.  Your brother overslept.  His problem is not yours.", "YTA..\n\nYou could have tried harder to wake him up. \nHe could have set an alarm but maybe he was so tired he fell asleep before he could.  People make mistakes.", "INFO: did your brother otherwise need to be awake at 7:30 this morning? Like did he think he was gonna need to get up for school or are you guys on break?", "Oh sorry about that I\u2019m (18m) and my younger brother is (17m)", "Yeah need more info here.\n\nI would not wake up to a text message, so it's weird if OP thinks that's normal lol. \n\nsome people are harder to wakeup. I have several alarms, set earlier than I need, because I have to ramp up waking up.\n\nIf he didn't know ahead of time this was gonna happen, I'd say Dad is the ahole because its like he's just looking for ways to punish you guys. \n\nKids are not employees!", "Right? Like are they on winter break or had another planned day off from school so he had a reasonable expectation of sleeping in past 7:30? In which case bro is not the ah for being a sleeping teenager at 7:30 in the morning\u2026", "Still don\u2019t see how that makes it his problem after yelling 5 times. He isn\u2019t the father here.", "I don't think expecting your children to do a basic winter chore is being too strict. Especially if it's a fresh snowfall and OP's dad wants them to get out and shovel it before it starts to melt and become more dense and difficult to shovel up.", "Op wasn't talked with waking up the brother. Also op tried several times. Also, today isn't a weekend. Also, if you think Dad is being unfair, then you can call dad ta, but that isn't OP's fault.", "Does he need to wipe his brothers ass as well?", "Brother is 17, according to the comments. He can wake up himself or set an alarm.", "Then he definitely should have been able to wake up", "OP's dad just wanted them to shovel the driveway and walkway, not put in 8 hours of work on a daily basis. What OP's dad asked them to do was a chore that any teenager should expect to get tasked with during the winter. \n\nIf the brother refuses to get up, that's on him.", "Exactly. I would argue that if his dad wants him up, his dad needs to wake him.", "So dad should leave his job and come home to wake up his 17 yo to do chores? Or the 17 yo can be woken up by his brother and do the chores that have been tasked to them."]}
