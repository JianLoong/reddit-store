You were tasked with waking him up, sounds like you barely tried.  And now he\u2019s being punished unfairly by your dad and it\u2019s partly your fault, AND you had the audacity to call him names, nice.

I have several alarms, set earlier than I need, because I have to ramp up waking up.\n\nIf he didn't know ahead of time this was gonna happen, I'd say Dad is the ahole because its like he's just looking for ways to punish you guys. \n\nKids are not employees!", "Right? Like are they on winter break or had another planned day off from school so he had a reasonable expectation of sleeping in past 7:30?

I would argue that if his dad wants him up, his dad needs to wake him.", "So dad should leave his job and come home to wake up his 17 yo to do chores?

I just don't think his brother is necessarily at fault either. Presumably he's not psychic.", "I could scream my husband's name all I wanted and he wouldn't wake up.

It was assigned while he was asleep and he was punished for not doing it as soon as he woke up.", "Yeah ik I've seen movies", "Being expected to do chores is 100% reasonable.

I could sleep on a bus, train, plain, at a concert, if I'm tired, it can happen. And I will ignore all around me, dead to the world. I grew up like this and it's difficult to change. \n\nMy current gf moved in with me, she could wake me for nothin! She could call me and shake, she tried pots and pans banging about. I'd left my phone on loud accidentally and I got a notification.....I woke up....\n\nIf it was my alarms I wake up, but with a caveat, every few months I have to change the tune or I get dead to it again. It's like subconsciously I can drown out everything with a filter and I'm waiting for \"my sound\". \n\nAll this to say, next time, just whip out your phone and play the alarm tunes and see what happens. The only other option was my gf pinched my nostrils closed and that wasn't a fun way to wake, I highly recommend avoiding that one for both your and his safety.", "NTA - if the brother doesn't get out of bed, then he is responsible.

Do you think he wanted to be out there shoveling alone?? \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "I kinda disagree about the dad\u2019s response being reasonable. It sounds like OPs brother did not know he needed to wake up early to shovel until after he went to bed. Do you regularly set your alarm earlier than you need to just incase someone might need you to do a chore? Cause I don\u2019t. They either tell me the night before or wait until I wake up. OPs dad then took his brothers phone for not psychically knowing he needed to wake up at 7:30 instead of his normal time. I do agree that OP is  N T A. But his dad is in my opinion.", "Snowball in bed? That's cold...", "OP needs to elaborate more on the brothers alarm situation. Re reading it, OP is inconsistent on the alarm situation. Op says that he should've set an alarm but in the latter half op says the brother always had an alarm at that time....\n\nI'd switch to saying the dad is unreasonable if he sporadically dropped the chore on them at that moment and it was abnormal for them both to be awake at 7:30.I But f the brother normally wakes up at that time then I could see it from the father's point of view thinking his son just slept in and left OP to do the work alone, which the father wouldn't be unreasonable.", "What committee decided yours was the childhood against which all others would be measured?", "Indeed it is, freezing even. My grandma did it to me once because I wouldn't get up for school. Never slept past my alarm again.", "Could have been expecting more snow and it's a lot easier to get rid of snow in waves than let it accumulate and shovel it all at once. \n\nOP's father tasked him with waking up his brother so they could shovel snow. OP attempted to wake up his brother to no avail. How far is OP supposed to go to wake up their brother?", "Jesus Christ man lmao. It was a joke about not getting much snow growing up lol chill out", "Do you have siblings? Because it's definitely reasonable to expect your child to wake up the other if your parent tells you that you both need to get up and do some chores. You're seriously gonna act like waking up your sibling is too much responsibility for an 18 yo and a 17 yo?\n\nGet a grip.", "OP has said they were yelling at their brother to wake up and he still stayed in bed. How much more do you expect OP to do?", "I\u2019m not saying OP is TA. But without OP answering the requests for info on if his brother was otherwise expected to be up 7:30 I\u2019m operating on the premise that he did not need to be up that early when he went to bed. I think the dad is the AH for punishing his kid when he woke up for not doing a chore that was assigned while he was asleep.", "Judgement aside, consider this: you had a chance here to earn some good will with your brother by helping him stay out of trouble, and you chose not to.  Next time he's got a chance to have your back, will he?  If you generally have a good relationship with your brother, it's not a bad thing to be extra considerate for each other.", "NTA. I won't wake up easy I get how that is but that's on me not the person trying to wake me up", "NTA", "He was definitely already awake and playing asleep so he didn't have to shovel, LOL! When he got called out, he blamed his sibling."]}
