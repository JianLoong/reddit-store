In my head, a sleepover is exactly that: sleeping over. I\u2019d planned what to make us for dinner, some games we could play and a movie he wants to rent. Then I was going to go to the park and a dog walk in the morning. I love my nephew and don\u2019t babysit very often (although had my niece and nephew for the full day 3 days ago). I said to my sister to drop him off around 3-4pm and I\u2019ll take him home around 12pm the following day, or a bit earlier (late morning), depending on what time he wakes up. He tends to go to bed around 8pm and wake up around 6/7, so in my eyes, that\u2019s around 4-5 hours in the evening and 5 hours in the morning for us to spend time together. My sister has an issue with this and doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m not having him earlier and dropping him off later I.e spending the days together, and thinks it\u2019s pointless me having him. She also has an issue with me saying I\u2019ll drop him off a bit earlier if he wakes up earlier, and is implying I want to get rid of him earlier and spend less time with him. I don\u2019t have children, have medical issues that cause me to have fatigue and my nephew needs a lot of attention and is very boisterous and energetic (he\u2019s a little immature for his age and acts very silly when excited).

I also booked time off work to get loads of house DIY stuff done, so I don\u2019t want to have him all of the next day as it\u2019ll delay me getting stuff done. I can understand how my sister might feel offended thinking I don\u2019t want to spend time with him, and she\u2019s saying I\u2019m implying he\u2019s an inconvenience, but I don\u2019t see why there\u2019s an issue when I\u2019m spending time with him in the evening and the next morning\u2026I\u2019m not used to having to entertain children and whilst I love my niece and nephew, I don\u2019t want children as I don\u2019t have a lot of patience and don\u2019t particularly enjoy being around children in general.

When it comes to spending time together, over 10 hours of togetherness is not \u201cpointless\u201d and it drives me insane when people act that way. My MIL did that - a long time ago my husband had guardianship of his sister\u2019s kids, and he had to set a boundary with MIL that they were no longer allowed to spend the night because every time they did, she would call around 11 PM - 12 AM and make us come get them because she pumped them full of sugar and caffeine and then couldn\u2019t control them or get them to sleep. When he set this boundary, she complained because \u201cit was pointless\u201d if they didn\u2019t spend the night. They lived 10 minutes away FFS, and could literally have the whole day together. She ended up taking him to court for grandparents\u2019 rights which she was only given since the children didn\u2019t live with either bio parent, and she still had to wait months before she was allowed overnight visits again AND she had to take court-ordered parenting classes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She seems to view her own child as an inconvenience!", "NTA, and what an entitled judgey brat your sister is.", "NTA it sounds like she wants him out of her house as long as possible lol", "NTA. However, I don\u2019t understand why you would have him over on the same day you\u2019re doing work in your house. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a completely free day after having him over?", "NTA. But a little immature for his age? My guy, he is 6 YEARS OLD, of course he\u2019s \u201cimmature\u201d. If you don\u2019t like hanging out with kids, that\u2019s fine, but readjust your expectations about how they should act lol", "INFO: Is your sister single?", "NTA", "NTA. If he's such a pleasure to be around, why isn't she excited that she gets more time to see her own kid rather than trying to guilt you into taking him away for longer?\n\nCall her bluff. Tell her if the time you are offering isn't really worth it like she says, then it's best you cancel.\n\nIs she planning a trip while her son is on the sleep over?", "NTA she's the one who wants rid of him not you. Also she has a choice she accepts this or not sleep over.", "NTA.  Having him from 3 or 4 in the afternoon to approximately noon the next day is plenty of time.   You have your own things on your weekend to do too.  She\u2019s the one who wants him there longer..for herself.", "NTA. You spend the time you are comfortable spending with your nephew, you are organised, plan ahead, entertain him, and take him back. I see no issue here that your sister can complain about.", "NTA. You were up front about your abilities and your boundaries. I've had similarish issues, where family members expected me to be free entertainment and babysitting. I can do that sometimes, but it becomes an issue when people expect too much and get upset when I'm unable to deliver. \n\nThink of it this way. Maybe sis was thinking you'd have him to noon the next day, and neither of you arranged a firm drop-off time. The next morning at 8:30 am you drop him off back home unannounced and sis is sleeping off a major hangover because she used her temporary freedom, and she refuses to take him  back. That would be all-round assholery. But that's not the case because you were a responsible adult and communicated.", "NTA. You are hosting him for a sleepover and that's great! Your sister is being picky because it means she gets less time off. My inlaws do sleepovers with our 6yo and we have always discussed drop off and pick up time. They once suggested a two night sleep over so we've done that once or twice, but it is totally up to them and how much they are up to. We are greatful for all the time they spend with her.", "NTA. In my country we say that kids are like farts. Your own are fine, but other's are annoying. She needs to learn that.", "NTA, but I will say he's not immature for his age, 6 years old are just like that", "He wanted to come over during the school holidays and this is the last week he can come over/was free to, and it coincides with the week I booked off work.", "Haha of course, he\u2019s a kid, he\u2019s going to act like a kid. Perhaps I should have elaborated on the post, but I meant he\u2019s immature for what you\u2019d expect a 6 year old to be. He likes to be the \u2018class clown\u2019 and acts like the maturity of a 3-4 year old quite often. He\u2019s also quite naughty in general, so not easy to entertain!", "Nope! She has a partner who\u2019s my niece and nephew\u2019s dad.", "Then NTA. I thought maybe she was trying to get a date in and didn't know if he would be gone by the time you would be bringing back your nephew. With that update I'm stumped.", "As a parent of 2, NTA\n\nThat is great and a lot of play time with the kid.\n\nEdit: if she has a hidden agenda, she needs to tell you.", "NTA shes just upset cause shes not getting as long of a break as she thought haha \ud83d\ude02 stand your ground lol you got shit to do!!", "NTA you are not obligated to watch a child any longer than you feel comfortable. Frankly, it sounds like your sister was hoping for you to hold on to him longer so she could have a longer break to do her own thing.", "NTA", "NTA and if you wouldn\u2019t spend time with him at all - still not the aushole", "NTAH but your sister is being one \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she should be saying \u201cthanx appreciate any time you can give him\u201d \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44", "Tell her to take it or leave it.

Do what you need to do for you. It is not your obligation to provide free babysitting", "NTA. When I babysit my great nephew who is 6, I tell his mum not to overdo it as she needs to pick him up by midday. I'm happy to have him over, but he is a spitfire, wakes up ridiculously early, needs to be entertained as he really struggles with amusing himself, and also, he misses his mum. \n\nYour sister is just thinking about herself, not him. She needs to parent her child and put her needs/desires after his.", "To be fair, she may have been trying to get a date in, still. When your kids are little, it's difficult for a couple to have alone time, and she was probably hoping for a full evening and next day to spend with her husband instead if just the morning (which, if she was anything like me when my kids were that age, they'll probably use to sleep in! \ud83d\ude02) They may also have household errands they'd love to get done without kids underfoot.\n\nHowever, none of that is really OP's problem to fix and it's not their job to provide free childcare at their sister's beck and call, either.\n\nNTA, OP\n\nI'm a nanny, and it's my literal job to plan fun and age appropriate activities for children, and I am very well aware of how draining and tiring it can be. So is your sister. In fact, she's most likely projecting her own desire to \"get rid of him\" for a little while onto you out of her guilt for feeling that way about her own kid.\n\nIt sounds like you have a nice evening and next morning planned for your nephew, especially since it's not something you're used to doing. I know when I was younger, sometimes sleepovers did last through the following day until late afternoon or evening, but those were the ones where I slept over at a friends' house, and there was another kid or two to play with, so we'd entertain ourselves the whole next day. Sleeping over at a grown relative's house where I was the only kid was a lot different, and I remember it mostly being a fun evening, but kind of boring the next day and was usually glad to go home by lunchtime, if not earlier.\n\nI also completely get having things to do and having time to get them done on your precious time off. I doubt your nephew wants to hang around while you perform boring household errands that you can't put off because they've probably been piling up for a while.\n\nIf your sister is hoping to cash in on having some childfree time, she needs to arrange more play dates for your nephew and have more kid sleepovers. She should also just be happy you care enough about your nephew to spend as much of your precious free time with him as you do."]}
