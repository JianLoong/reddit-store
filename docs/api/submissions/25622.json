{"id": 25622, "submission_id": "162nd08", "title": "AITA for only wanting to spend a certain amount of time time with my nephew?", "selftext": "So i (32F) had agreed to have my nephew (6M) over for a sleepover, and he has been asking for a while. In my head, a sleepover is exactly that: sleeping over. I\u2019d planned what to make us for dinner, some games we could play and a movie he wants to rent. Then I was going to go to the park and a dog walk in the morning. I love my nephew and don\u2019t babysit very often (although had my niece and nephew for the full day 3 days ago). I said to my sister to drop him off around 3-4pm and I\u2019ll take him home around 12pm the following day, or a bit earlier (late morning), depending on what time he wakes up. He tends to go to bed around 8pm and wake up around 6/7, so in my eyes, that\u2019s around 4-5 hours in the evening and 5 hours in the morning for us to spend time together. My sister has an issue with this and doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m not having him earlier and dropping him off later I.e spending the days together, and thinks it\u2019s pointless me having him. She also has an issue with me saying I\u2019ll drop him off a bit earlier if he wakes up earlier, and is implying I want to get rid of him earlier and spend less time with him. I don\u2019t have children, have medical issues that cause me to have fatigue and my nephew needs a lot of attention and is very boisterous and energetic (he\u2019s a little immature for his age and acts very silly when excited). He also gets very bored easily and I find it difficult to entertain him, so IMO, I was saying I\u2019d drop him off late morning / 12ish as the earlier he\u2019s up, the more likely he\u2019ll get bored quicker. I also booked time off work to get loads of house DIY stuff done, so I don\u2019t want to have him all of the next day as it\u2019ll delay me getting stuff done. I can understand how my sister might feel offended thinking I don\u2019t want to spend time with him, and she\u2019s saying I\u2019m implying he\u2019s an inconvenience, but I don\u2019t see why there\u2019s an issue when I\u2019m spending time with him in the evening and the next morning\u2026I\u2019m not used to having to entertain children and whilst I love my niece and nephew, I don\u2019t want children as I don\u2019t have a lot of patience and don\u2019t particularly enjoy being around children in general. AITA for not having him over for longer?\n\nUPDATE:\nThanks everyone for your thoughts. We ended up arguing about it and I just couldn\u2019t understand what her issue was. It boiled down to her main issue being with me saying \u2018I\u2019ll drop him off at 12, maybe a bit earlier if he wakes up earlier\u2019, as that\u2019s where she felt I wanted to spend less time with him, as I was moving the goal posts earlier, rather than it being \u2018I\u2019m not free past x time\u2019, maybe I could have phrased that better. I was trying to communicate that I was just giving a caveat of maybe earlier in case he\u2019s bored and wants to go, or if I needed child-free time earlier than 12 and my energy levels were depleted (I said late morning, I\u2019d understand her having a problem me dropping him off at 8am). She said feels sad for him cos it\u2019s like I want to get rid of him as early as possible, and she feels other relatives don\u2019t seem to want to look after him for long (probably because he\u2019s so high energy and isn\u2019t good at self play so needs constant attention and entertainment). She didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him sleeping over if I felt he was \u2018too much\u2019 (her words, I never said that) and that he\u2019s my nephew, so I should want to spend time with him doing kid stuff (of course I do, but I was explaining that as someone who has chosen not to have children and has low energy levels, there\u2019s a limit). She just doesn\u2019t see my point and I felt guilty that sometimes I do think my nephew is too much for ME and MY energy levels (but I\u2019d never say that to him!) she ended up apologising and he came over (she obviously realised she had argued her way out of a child-free evening), and we\u2019ve had a nice time together, but it\u2019s rubbish being made to feel like the bad guy for setting a boundary!

You were up front about your abilities and your boundaries. I've had similarish issues, where family members expected me to be free entertainment and babysitting. I can do that sometimes, but it becomes an issue when people expect too much and get upset when I'm unable to deliver. \n\nThink of it this way. Maybe sis was thinking you'd have him to noon the next day, and neither of you arranged a firm drop-off time. The next morning at 8:30 am you drop him off back home unannounced and sis is sleeping off a major hangover because she used her temporary freedom, and she refuses to take him  back. That would be all-round assholery. But that's not the case because you were a responsible adult and communicated.", "NTA. You are hosting him for a sleepover and that's great! Your sister is being picky because it means she gets less time off. My inlaws do sleepovers with our 6yo and we have always discussed drop off and pick up time.

When your kids are little, it's difficult for a couple to have alone time, and she was probably hoping for a full evening and next day to spend with her husband instead if just the morning (which, if she was anything like me when my kids were that age, they'll probably use to sleep in! \ud83d\ude02) They may also have household errands they'd love to get done without kids underfoot.\n\nHowever, none of that is really OP's problem to fix and it's not their job to provide free childcare at their sister's beck and call, either.\n\nNTA, OP\n\nI'm a nanny, and it's my literal job to plan fun and age appropriate activities for children, and I am very well aware of how draining and tiring it can be.

I know when I was younger, sometimes sleepovers did last through the following day until late afternoon or evening, but those were the ones where I slept over at a friends' house, and there was another kid or two to play with, so we'd entertain ourselves the whole next day. Sleeping over at a grown relative's house where I was the only kid was a lot different, and I remember it mostly being a fun evening, but kind of boring the next day and was usually glad to go home by lunchtime, if not earlier.\n\nI also completely get having things to do and having time to get them done on your precious time off. I doubt your nephew wants to hang around while you perform boring household errands that you can't put off because they've probably been piling up for a while.\n\nIf your sister is hoping to cash in on having some childfree time, she needs to arrange more play dates for your nephew and have more kid sleepovers. She should also just be happy you care enough about your nephew to spend as much of your precious free time with him as you do.", "I don't know why you want to have him over at all after his mother tries to fight with you over how long you'll keep him.\n\nHe isn't your responsibility.

When your little relatives come to visit it's somehow supposed to be all fun all the time.", "Yeah, sister wants to sleep in and have a leisurely morning.

Obviously you care about your nephew, as you want to have him over.  Having limits on what you can offer in a relationship is normal.   \n\nYour sister wants you to be a different person.

Not to be cruel or mean but having an active little boy that age is EXHAUSTING.
