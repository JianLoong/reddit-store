I was hesitant and didn\u2019t want to flat out just say no because he is very sensitive and starts arguments often, so I said it would depend how I feel but I thought it would be better if I did it in a week and half when I felt recovered from this chemo cycle. He was insistent and kept asking if I could \u201cjust try\u201d and wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. \n\nI started to become agitated because if I\u2019m being honest, I want to feel coddled and taken care of during this time in my life, not pushed to do chores. It\u2019s not as if he was asking for a single meal, he wanted his entire week\u2019s worth of food made by me after being in the hospital for 10 hours.\n\nFor reference, he works early mornings and gets out in the early afternoon. It\u2019s not as if he is so busy he cannot do this himself. I think his point is that he still wants to be taken care of as well, which is understandable, but it\u2019s not as if I never do anything for him. Whenever he is at my place I offer any food I have on hand, will cook meals or make a sandwich depending on the day. I rub and massage him when we are on the couch, ask about himself and his life ect (in other words it\u2019s not like our entire lives are about me and my sickness) \nAlso, I didn\u2019t straight out refuse to make his meals, I just offered to make them when I knew I would feel better. \n\nHe blew up on me saying acts of services is his love language and that our relationship is one sided. He went on and on sending angry texts. I didn\u2019t argue back too much because I\u2019m not much for arguing. He doesn\u2019t even do that much for me.

Chemo doesn't only attack the cancer, it attacks every part of you and the body needs whatever time and rest to bounce back.

Care for yourself first as you are good to no one in barely clinging condition!\n\nI send you vibes of hope that you can get that cancer into remission and keep it that way for a long life ahead of you.

I\u2019m apprehensive about asking for too much help though because it\u2019s out of my nature.

Some people\u2019s love language is acts of service, some people\u2019s is gifts or physical touch or whatever and it\u2019s really starting to fall along a particular binary. \nIf the bf\u2019s \u2018love language\u2019 was \u2018acts of service\u2019 he\u2019d be showing up a lot more for her, with surely more acts of service than occasionally taking out the trash and the odd massage.
