I was hesitant and didn\u2019t want to flat out just say no because he is very sensitive and starts arguments often, so I said it would depend how I feel but I thought it would be better if I did it in a week and half when I felt recovered from this chemo cycle. He was insistent and kept asking if I could \u201cjust try\u201d and wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. \n\nI started to become agitated because if I\u2019m being honest, I want to feel coddled and taken care of during this time in my life, not pushed to do chores. It\u2019s not as if he was asking for a single meal, he wanted his entire week\u2019s worth of food made by me after being in the hospital for 10 hours.\n\nFor reference, he works early mornings and gets out in the early afternoon. It\u2019s not as if he is so busy he cannot do this himself. I think his point is that he still wants to be taken care of as well, which is understandable, but it\u2019s not as if I never do anything for him. Whenever he is at my place I offer any food I have on hand, will cook meals or make a sandwich depending on the day. I rub and massage him when we are on the couch, ask about himself and his life ect (in other words it\u2019s not like our entire lives are about me and my sickness) \nAlso, I didn\u2019t straight out refuse to make his meals, I just offered to make them when I knew I would feel better. \n\nHe blew up on me saying acts of services is his love language and that our relationship is one sided. He went on and on sending angry texts. I didn\u2019t argue back too much because I\u2019m not much for arguing. He doesn\u2019t even do that much for me.

Chemo doesn't only attack the cancer, it attacks every part of you and the body needs whatever time and rest to bounce back.

Care for yourself first as you are good to no one in barely clinging condition!\n\nI send you vibes of hope that you can get that cancer into remission and keep it that way for a long life ahead of you.

As you can imagine, it was exhausting being with him. Hence just one reason why he's an ex husband.", "This story is like so many others who try to use the love languages concept in this way. It is better utilized by trying to understand how your partner shows love so that when your partner shows you love, you can feel loved. The issue in most relationships is partners don't feel loved because they don't recognize how their partner shows love. Once they understand their partner's love language, they can see it and feel it. \"Oh, *that* is how she is showing she loves me.\" And it is effective because it is natural. Your partner is naturally doing those things/acting that way because that's how they show love without even trying. It comes about because they love you.\n\nWhen couples try to utilize it the opposite way and say, \"you need to start showing me love in my language for me to feel loved\", one of three things usually happens. One, the partner doesn't utilize the love language effectively because it doesn't come naturally to them. I suppose an example would be if a partner wants an act of service such as cleaning the entire house and the partner makes the bed. Since the partner's love language isn't acts of service, they might think they showed love by making the bed, but their partner is actually just frustrated and perceives the act as lazy or \"doing the bare minimum.\" Communication would fix this but, again, a lot of people tend to have negative feelings about having to explain something that they feel should come naturally. Having to explain to their partner they want them to clean the whole house instead of just making the bed, to them, feels like it negates the act of service. This is just one example. Two, the partner may not utilize the love language as often as the partner feels necessary. Let's say the partner *does* clean the house to try to show love in their partner's love language. Without great communication that involves no resentment or negativity on either side, it's very possible the partner could think he only has to do this once every 6 months to show love. His partner may be thinking it needs to be done twice a month. Three, the partner may just forget to show love with their partner's love language because it doesn't come naturally and life is busy. If the partner is expecting it and it doesn't happen, this can cause the relationship to be in worse shape than it already was because it is perceived as the partner not caring enough to remember. When really it just doesn't come naturally to them. \n\nIf both partners actually love each other, their love languages are communicated naturally without effort. It's much more effective for each partner to realize what their partner's love language is and recognize when that language is being spoken to them. Each partner can feel loved when they recognize when that love language is being communicated to them.\n\nETA: Actual couples therapy is better than trying to utilize the love languages concept on your own because a therapist can help a couple utilize actual psychological concepts alongside some of the love languages concepts.", "I cannot disagree with you.

When someone thinks of me or insists on caring for me it always takes my breath away and it's not something I feel entitled to.\n\nEvery other acts of service people I know are the same way. \n\nWe don't need you to ask us for something, we are on the look out for the opportunity to express it without being asked. And if someone we love is seriously ill, like with cancer? OMG be prepared to never lift a finger, you will more than likely be so annoyed with us hovering and fussing over you by the time you're in remission.\n\nI'm not saying acts of service isn't really your boyfriends love language, what I am saying is he is acting entitled to you doing things for him.\n\nI am saying that his priorities are seriously out of whack. Specifically when he need to prioritize others needs over his wants.\n\nI am saying that the last thing you need to be worried about, is your partners apparent inability to handle disappointment.\n\nI'm saying that no is a full sentence, one that you don't feel secure to say to your boyfriend because you fear his reactions to being told it.\n\nThe only thing you need to be concerned with right now is your health. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. You're already having to inject your body with one type of toxin in order to save it, you aren't doing yourself any favors by choosing to remain in a relationship with another.", "Reddit is making hate the term \"love language\".

Lmao", "My spouse's love language was Acts of Service. Mine was quality time.  If I ran out of an ingredient in a recipe, they would want to run out and get it for me. But I would rather substitute and have them be at home with me.", "While I really love the 'love tank' analogy, I hate how it's been twisted to be seen as a partner's responsibility to fully fill it up.

He based \"The 5 love languages\" book on the strict gender roles espoused by complementarianism, a section of Christianity focused on the subjugation of women.

Please know you deserve to be taken care of.", "Sounds like it's been a positive for you two! That's great!", "Yeah...my Wife said that she wouldn't go because CLEARLY my lack of attraction to her was MY problem...which clearly exemplifies the rest of the problem.

SO that everyone in that cycle is the same--which is just silly.\n\nIf you take a comprehensive \"horoscope\" which includes planets/moon and year/time.  Then you could get a more specific profile, but then there are so many other factors.

I am SO glad you have a loving, supportive partner!  Good vibes to you throughout your cancer journey \u2728\ufe0f", "The love language test saved my marriage. Once my husband and I understood how we were miscommunicating, we dropped our therapist and started relating to each other in ways that pretty much solved most of our problems with each other. He does more acts of service these days, and appreciates the ones I do for him. I give him the praise he needs, AND conversely I couch my words more carefully when I need to call him on something he's not doing (i.e., not being confronting or angry, which just brings out his defensive side). We did couples counseling before we got married... 2 sessions in we took the love language quiz... ended therapy the 3 session.

My ex husband and I actually TAUGHT this stuff to people for YEARS. When you are being Godly, God is the one that ultimately fills those tanks. Not your partner necessarily! It's not their responsibility! I never realized I was stuck in a co-dependent hell. My current marriage is MUCH more free. He's not responsible for me being happy and vice versa. But we want the other to be happy so we do what we can when we can. But we can't be the end-all, be-all for each other. No one can. Trying to do that leads to mental, physical and spiritual exhaustion.

This guy is just a selfish ass.", "My ex was lazy as fuck so I don't foresee myself living with another person for a very long time as I like having my own place before anyone attempts to say I just want someone to do chores for me but isn't the idea of love languages being that you show the person based upon their own languages?

People, in my opinion, marry too young in the church and have not realized who they are on their own and so they tend to rely on their spouse to make them fully happy and oh boy, is that a huge mistake cuz people, even the one you love most, make dumb mistakes and make you sad and angry a lot.  They give this false picture of marriage and set these kids up to fail."]}
