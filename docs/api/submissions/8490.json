He helped pay for the funeral, and plan it with my, obviously, grieving mother. But he doesn't want to see his grandfather dead, he wants to remember him how he was.

She called your brother heartless and by implication you aswell. Being called heartless is far more offensive then telling someone to fuck off", "NTA sorry for your loss, your sister is out of line.", "NTA. Loss of family isn't easy and everyone deals with grief differently, but your sister isn't allowed to control how your brother chooses to grieve, nor should she have dragged you into it then get pissy when you disagreed.", "NTA", "NTA. I get the impression that your sister should frequently be told to fuck off.", "NTA\n\nYour sister forced you to give her an answer she didn't want to hear.

Instead you told your sister to fuck all the way off.\n\nThat's not something you do at a funeral.", "Soft ESH -- your sister should not have dragged you (or anyone else) into this argument, but you escalated the situation with that remark. You're both grieving, though, so it's understandable. Apologizing for the way you said it, while affirming that you still support your brother's choices, might be a good option.", "Like others have said, it was asshole-ish to tell your sister to fuck off, but we all say stupid shit when emotions are raw.

OP didn\u2019t say this at the funeral", "I'm not psychologist or nothing, but I remember once saying that some people that have issues with control can't accept any other way than their own, because then they'll start to think their way could be wrong and there ain't no way in heck they will admit to doing something wrong.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother has made his decision and that's his right.\n\nHowever, he has options to be at the funeral and not have to see his grandfather's body.\n\nWhen my FIL died we were honest with my two young kids about what to expect. I did not want to see him. My husband didn't really either but he felt he had to, so he decided to. My 7 year old daughter was adamant that she did NOT want to see him. My 5 year old son, meanwhile, DID want to see him.\n\nIn the end both kids were satisfied with their decisions and have no regrets. Daughter and I waited until the rest of the family paid their respects, then they closed the coffin and we joined everyone else.\n\nMaybe bring this up to your brother privately as an option, but be sure to reassure him that you're not pressuring him into changing his mind.", "NTA, good for you for standing up for your brother. He lost someone he was very close to, and should be supported in his way of grieving. That's what you did. Your sister making it about herself is selfish.", "Well, everyone is grieving within one's terms but a funeral is also the time to support each other as a family, especially your Mum. Not only helping each other out emotionally but just supporting with organizing etc. This is real life, you can't make a funeral about yourself just because you grief on your terms. YTA and it seems that you simply don't like your sister", "I wish I didn't see so many of my dead relatives, I didn't like it at all as a kid and it is one of the main images you remember with emotions so high. If you care so much then accomodate him and do an early open casket wake then close it for the funeral he attends. Boom solved."]}
