I did not want to see him. My husband didn't really either but he felt he had to, so he decided to. My 7 year old daughter was adamant that she did NOT want to see him. My 5 year old son, meanwhile, DID want to see him.\n\nIn the end both kids were satisfied with their decisions and have no regrets. Daughter and I waited until the rest of the family paid their respects, then they closed the coffin and we joined everyone else.\n\nMaybe bring this up to your brother privately as an option, but be sure to reassure him that you're not pressuring him into changing his mind.", "NTA, good for you for standing up for your brother. He lost someone he was very close to, and should be supported in his way of grieving. That's what you did. Your sister making it about herself is selfish.", "Well, everyone is grieving within one's terms but a funeral is also the time to support each other as a family, especially your Mum. Not only helping each other out emotionally but just supporting with organizing etc. This is real life, you can't make a funeral about yourself just because you grief on your terms. YTA and it seems that you simply don't like your sister", "I wish I didn't see so many of my dead relatives, I didn't like it at all as a kid and it is one of the main images you remember with emotions so high. If you care so much then accomodate him and do an early open casket wake then close it for the funeral he attends. Boom solved.", "I'm on the side of NAH. I think that the sister wants her brother with her so it can help her deal with her grief.  Let's not forget that a funeral is a ritual to help the living to deal with a death and move on. I hope the bother has a ritual that can help him deal with it all. I don't believe saying goodbye is enough.", "NTA..everyone grieves in their own ways, that's definitely true. It's also true your sister did drag you into it and you backed your brother. The \"fuck off\" part maybe a bit strong. However you are not wrong and shouldn't feel like an a.h Funerals are horrible and tend to bring out the worst in people. \n\nI do genuinly want to know, why not seeing the person who has past helps you to remember them as is?? Can't you remember them as they were whilst going to the funeral? I never understood that.", "**NTA**. It's ironic that your sister has called your brother \"heartless\". It's also likely that your aunt is only telling you to stay out of it because a) she knows you're correct, and b) because your sister has clearly sought back-up in the form of your aunt when she herself is grieving too. Sister is the issue here - everyone should be able to grieve the way they want to.\n\nIf it were me and it kept being brought up, I'd stick to saying something like \"I support whatever Brother chooses to do, I will be going to support Mum, and I am not going to talk about it any further.\"", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to try not to get involved. But your sister was unreasonable and did not leave you that option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: YOuir answer was reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you stop answering your sister's calls until the funeral is over to avoid all of this drama? Just ignore her unreasonable behavior,and let her rant to someone else.", "NTA\n\nI lost my Nana last July. I\u2019d said my goodbyes to her at the end of April jn hospital when they said it was her final hours. I then said it again a few days later because she was stubborn and didn\u2019t agree with the doctors! She was conscious and having a \u2018good\u2019 day the second time. My last words were \u2018I love you Nana\u2019 and she replied \u2018I love you\u2019 back.\n\nShe was in a hospice for another 12 weeks. Family went to see her but I couldn\u2019t. The stories they told me were too upsetting to be honest. I made that mistake when I lost my Grandad when I was 14 and that final day is my strongest memory when I think of him and it\u2019s awful. \n\nYou\u2019re all allowed to grieve now you like. You\u2019re allowed to preserve your memories.", "NTA when your sister speaks just pretend to not realize she was speaking to you.", "My almost 95 year old grandmother has dementia.  My sister has chosen (although she sometimes wavers) not to visit her anymore, because she doesn't want to see Grandma as she is now.  Instead, she wants to remember her as she was.\n\nI completely understand.  I see Grandma and she is not the same person she was for almost all of my life.  She is grumpy, has delusions and says things to people that she would NEVER have said before she got dementia.  I really don't enjoy seeing her like that.\n\nMy grandmother notices if I don't visit, because I live close.  But she doesn't worry if my sister doesn't because my sister lives several hours away and so Grandma just doesn't expect her.  So it isn't hurting Grandma if my sister doesn't come.\n\nI feel like this is a similar situation.  Sometimes you want to remember your loved ones as they were when they were 'themselves'.  Although I remember Grandma perfectly well when she was her normal self, hearing the things she says does tarnish things a bit, even when I know it's not her fault.", "NTA - So your sister thinks your brother needs to be there to support her through her grief but refuses to be there to support him through his just because he expresses his in a different way than she does? What a selfish AH. She has a whole-ass spouse to support her.", "NTA - Normally, I would say stay out out of it. But, you were asked. *shrug", "NTA. I hate funerals. It's very hard for me to be visibly upset around people I don't know super well. And I have visual memory problems. But I'm way more likely to remember something if I'm feeling a strong emotion and I really don't want the last visual memory I have of someone being their dead body. \n\nBut the first funeral I skipped was before my brain injury. Ironically for my grandpa. No one gave me a hard time. The most anyone said was two of my aunt's pulling me aside to make sure I wouldn't regret not going.", "NTA \n\nYour sister dragged you into it, and the consequences are her own fault, not to mention that she is wrong.", "Going to go against the majority and say YTA to both OP, and the brother; Mostly the brother.   I hate funerals, but I go to the ones I can to support the people I love, who are suffering.  Your brother not supporting your own mother when she's grieving is disgusting.\n\nYour sister has every right to be upset that your brother isn't willing to sit with his mother, and so much as hold her hand during her father's funeral.  This shouldn't be behavior that is defended, let alone being handled they way you did.", "I stopped seeing my grandma with dementia. I described the situation as \u201cmy grandma is dead; I\u2019m just waiting for her corpse to die\u201d. Granted, I was living a very long way away, so there wasn\u2019t many chances I passed on. Thank you for understanding your sister.", "I only saw one relative dead and it has forever swayed me to never want to see another one. I was about 7 when my grandpa died. We were all brought in to see him as he was taken off of life support, and I'll never, ever forget it.\n\nMy mom told me to grab his hand and say I love him and that it's okay. I was so freaking terrified!!! I couldn't understand why his body was moving like he was breathing but he wouldn't wake up. I was bawling and forced to hold his hand and then he passed. Everyone thought it was so sweet that I got to be there and hold his hand but I was just so scared and confused. Nobody explained death to me at this point either so it was just awful. I have had relatives pass since then, and the way I grieve is more a celebration of life than funeral. I don't want to see them dead, I want to remember them for who they were and so full of life. It just sucks because people give me very odd looks when I avoid being near open caskets, but I'm there for the living who are suffering the loss."]}
