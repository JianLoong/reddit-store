What kind of asshat talks to children like that?", "No that's the stupidest reason to be mad at someone", "Hmm. On one hand, you technically can't apologise on his behalf. On the other hand, he didn't have to be an ass. He could just have told them no and moved on. I do that all the time. \n\nThere is no doubt that using cute young women for this sort of thing is common. When I'm out and about, and I see someone who is trying to get people to donate to some cause or sell something, there's a 90% chance that the someone is a cute young woman. \n\nIt's a neat psychological trick. When men are asked to do something, we are more inclined to say yes if the person asking is a cute young woman. \n\nAs an engineer, I've been to a number of industrial fairs. Even in that sort of environment, a surprisingly large number of companies use that strategy. I always find it ridiculous that they use women barely out of college to draw the attention of grumpy middle-aged engineers like me. \n\nFor me, however, having seen through the strategy, it has the opposite effect. I always say no out of principle. If the product or service you're selling isn't good enough to draw me in on its own, and you need an attractive young woman to move my attention away from the product, I'm unlikely to want or need it. If I'm interested in your product, I want to talk to *your* grumpy middle-aged engineer who knows how it works and what it can do. \n\nThat was a bit of a tangent, but all of that was to say that in almost all such situations, I say no out of principle. But I'm not rude about it. The young women who are standing there have done nothing wrong. They are simply doing their jobs, and they don't deserve to be spoken down to. I just say no and keep walking.

Is your BIL always such a fun killer?", "NTA You apologised because you were embarrassed to be associated with a grown man who actively sought to bully two little girls. You of course have a right to apologise. It's what any responsible adult would have done.

Geez!", ">He told me I had no right to apologize for him.\n\nHaha, so what is he actually mad about? Does he feel like you shamed him by calling him out on being an asshole to children? Cuz he should. Cuz he was an asshole. Like, that was so uncalled for. Does he feel proud of himself, big man, talking down to little girls trying to fund raise by selling cookies? \n\nCuz it actually comes across to me like he literally is mad that you're putting an apology in to his mouth he didn't want to give, which would be perfectly in line with the attitude of a man who tried to lord himself over children.\n\nNTA at all. Your BIL should be ashamed.", "NTA. DONT LET HIM HAVE ANY COOKIES.", "NTA but he most certainly is.", "NTA he's just mad you called him out in front of the girls and ruined his fun.
