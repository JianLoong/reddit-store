I tell them, \"I am so sorry you were treated so rudely. and since he won't apologize, I will apologize for him. What can I do to help you?\" I'm sick of rude doctors.

Those girls are going to remember the mean old man who was rude to them. It\u2019s not like they were doing anything wrong or misbehaving.\n\nEdit: NTA\nGood on you for being the better person. BIL should have apologized himself, but at least you had the decency to apologize for poor behavior when you saw it. You\u2019re a good person. Your BIL needs a lesson on treating others how he wants to be treated.", "NTA. BIL is not speaking to you? That is a gift. Don't talk to that AH.", "NTA.
