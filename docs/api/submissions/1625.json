But it's also a huge part of why YTA.\n\nYour parents may have behaved badly, and out of ignorance, but you're the one who cares more about punishing your parents publicly and for everyone you know to see than you do about humiliating your wife with a daily reminder of the work she had to do to survive, and continuing to make your son's birth the centre of an ugly family spat.", "ESH. \n\nWhat your parents did was wrong. However you claim you have reconciled and yet you continue to have a reminder that they missed your wedding. What you are doing is childish and petty.", "NTA they chose to be judgemental AHs who basically accused your wife of having an affair and shamed her for her previous proffession.(sex work is real work and people need to get over themselves) Good on you for keeping them accountable. I hope you, your wife and your child have a great peaceful life without that nonsense in it", "NTA.

I would be embarrassed.", "I'm going to say NTA. I'm torn though. On one hand, it is pretty petty but your parents are no stranger to pettiness either. It just seems to me like there really hasn't been a reconciliation if you still feel the need to display the test. Just a cease fire really. Also, props to you on not judging your wife on her past and for not standing for anyone else judging her on it either.", "NTA - is it petty? Yes, yes it is. Is it your right to be petty? Yes it is.", "Hahaha NTA THAT IS SO FUNNY \ud83d\ude02 bruh I would do this too tbh just deserts indeed", "NTA provided your wife is ok with this all.

Your parents - yeah, it was shitty of them to not come to the wedding or demand the test. Obviously.\n\n2. You\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t care at all for how you spoke of your wife\u2019s former sex work. It doesn\u2019t matter why she did it - whether it was for survival or just the way she chose to earn a living. She was an adult, she made a decision about her body and her livelihood and that\u2019s okay. Your comment reeks of your own shame and judgment surrounding the line of work. Also leaving it up and framed is\u2026. I don\u2019t know, kind of a weird grudge thing, but whatever.", "info: does your wife mind it up?", "It doesn't sound like you've reconciled if you're still keeping that up to be petty.

They put themselves in that situation by judging your wife", "YTA for not being the better person.  However, you and I would bta together.  Take it down and hang it in a more appropriate place like the bathroom where they would have to sit and look at it.  Your family ata because they uses ultimatums as weapons.  They had no business here.  They are looking foolish and hurting themselves and their relationship with their grandchild... Assuming you will allow them to have one.  This isn't a behavior a child should learn.", "ESH. You said they made amends. It doesn't seem like it. It seems like you're still hung up on it and it isn't fine. Which is totally OK for you to feel that way. What they did was abhorrent. But you're living a lie making them think it's in the past, and you pushed that back out into the open with this passive aggressive thing you did.", "NTA next time tell them \"you should be embarrassed. you should be ashamed. that's the point.

My wife will decide when I've made my point and you'll thank her.\"", "I'm not sure since it depends on your wife's feelings", "YTA, because while you view it as a reminder of some triumph over your parent's assholery, it also serves as a constant reminder of how they treated your wife terribly. It's also flaunting that situation in front of anyone who enters your home. No shame needed for your wife's past at all, but do you think hanging a \"haha the baby IS mine even though my parents didn't think so because wife was a sex worker!\" decor on the wall os somehow respectful to her? \n\nIt's weird. Take it down and move forward.", "YTA but I live for this level of petty xD", "YTA\n\nYou made your point. Take it down.", "NTA your parents do a lot of refusing their presence. I would go no/low contact with them. They brought this on themselves.", "Only in the best kind of way. Keep.it up, that's your kid, be proud of your little family", "NTA but I would take it down when child\u2019s older as they don\u2019t need to know how their grandparents felt at a young age", "NTA.

You've clearly not reconciled this. And it is petty. It also serves as a reminder of your wife's past too, as that was the reason they wanted the test. I don't know the intention of the parents besides maybe they love and were trying to protect their son. Execution was obviously wrong on their part, but  I'm sure since getting to know your wife since they have accepted her as you say you've \"reconciled\". Or they have anyway. Why open old wounds and purposefully cause hurt from something that is now supposedly water under the bridge? And if you and your wife can't see how bringing up a past thing that maybe they're not proud of but had maybe good intentions isn't wrong then I got nothin for ya. I would think of all people you both would get it. Just wow. Either you forgive them or not, but have some balls and be honest about it with them, hopefully anything more that was still lingering could be resolved with an adult conversation. So congrats, they passed the asshole title on to their son.", "NTA lmao. Just make sure you take it down until your kid grows and starts to ask questions", "NTA who cares who's child it could have been so long as you were happy and your wife was happy.", "INFO: How does your wife feel about it?", "omg this is my favourite AITA story. dont you dare take that down, this is amazing. you rock", "Info was your wife doing sex work when your son was conceived?", "NTA- But please take it down when your kid gets older, he doesn\u2019t need to know", "NTA\n\nThey insisted on not letting go of the past, and now are upset that you are feeding them their own crap? Good job, OP, I love petty.", "Yes\n\nEither you're ready to reconcile.. or you aren't.\nTelling them how you gloat to friends about their actions.. makes you the asshole.

Your parents were outrageous.  It sounds like you are still punishing them.  When will it be done?  If you don't want to take it down now, you can think about a time that you would take it down.  If I were your wife, I would not want the picture on the wall and you telling that story to everyone.", ">take it down saying I'm being too harsh on them and refusing to let go of the past\n\nFunny how that only works when it's in favor of them, but not when they were asked to let go of the fact that your wife did what she had to to survive. \n\nNTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA. If your wife was a sex worker during the course of your relationship, then it is a valid concern that they had. You are also hanging this on the wall for all who enter to reflect on your wife\u2019s past. Is she comfortable with this? Seems like you are embarrassing yourself and your wife just to be petty.", "NTA, play childish games win childish prizes. Bravo on this \ud83d\udc4f", "As parents they can have concerns for their son's future. Btw you have reconciled so i think you should put it down.", "I'm going to say NTA, but was your wife a sex worker when your son was conceived, and what exactly did your parents say? Were they rude, or were they just insisting on a test? Sure, it's petty, but depending on how they acted, I would have done the same thing in your place.", "Not going to give judgement, cause I'm conflicted. It's petty to the max but also funny as hell.\n\nI think you've made your point though, take it down and work on letting that resentment go, for your own sake", "NTA. I find it pretty telling by their attitude towards the DNA test isn\u2019t out of shame for how poorly they treated your wife for being a former sex worker; but rather what other people would think of them. I\u2019d have a sit down with your parents and find out what they still think of your wife. Because personally, I wouldn\u2019t want my parents near my child if they\u2019re gonna view my partner as \u201clesser than.\u201d", "NTA- hahaha this is great. I do agree with what someone else said about taking it down before your kid get too old tho.", "NTA.let the trash stay away", "NTA (for now)\n\nYou made your point. If they have apologized and regret their choice (or if they no longer are allowed over) the test being out does nothing other than point to asshole behavior. \n\nWhy is it important to you to share with people (that see the test) that your parents didn\u2019t trust your wife?

What if they had gone to a fertility clinic, and the clinic used the wrong sperm (it happens)? My point is, it's no one's business who biologically fathered the child, except the parents. Clearly in this case, OP is the bio father, but even if he had decided to raise someone else's child as his own, that should not have been a reason for the grandparents to refuse to come to the wedding. They were the judgmental AHs here. Now they are reaping what they sowed.", "To me, it sounds like he explains how his parents refused to attend the wedding without a DNA test and nothing further.
