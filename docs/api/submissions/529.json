{"id": 529, "submission_id": "yhknaf", "title": "AITA for refusing to be a live-in maid and clean up after everyone else?", "selftext": "So 2 and a half months ago my husband and I moved into my friend's house. Prior to this move, I would come over and visit my friend at least every week, and I would usually stay 2 or 3 days. In those 2 or 3 days, I would help my friend take care of her pets, which also included refilling the dog's water bowl (its has the big blue 4 gallon jug on it). I didn't have to do this, but because I like the animals, I figured I'd help, no problem. The problem however, is my friend's boyfriend. When we first moved in, he was gone over the road, so the only dishes that we had to do is ones that we made, which isn't a problem because it makes sense that you clean up after yourself. But when her boyfriend would come home, all it took was one day and the entire kitchen would be trashed and his corner of the living room would be filthy: dirty socks, chew tins, spit bottles, and a literal mountain of dirty dishes.\n\nUnderstandably, I started to put off washing the dishes. I would only do them if someone helped me. After all, you dirty it you clean it. And after moving in, I noticed that my friend actually ignored the pets. She would notice the empty water bowl but wouldn't fill it, she would go days without cleaning her cat's litter etc, so I took it upon myself to start looking after the pets. However, I have now stopped doing things. I still refill the water bowl, but that's because there's now 3 dogs living in the house *(my friend's boyfriend let one of his buddies+his dog move in)*. Other than that, I don't clean the kitchen or the living room because you know, 5 fucking people are living in the house. My husband and I still wash our own dishes and put them up, but that's it. As for the animals, I have tried several times to keep up on the cat litter, but it very quickly became a \"me\" thing, meaning no one else but my husband would help me with it. I would even tell my friend that she needs to clean the litter more, but she blows it off like I'm bothering her.\n\nSo aside from the water, I'm not helping with the animals or keeping the house clean. Why should I when I spent the first month of living here cleaning up after everyone else and no one bothers to help? My friend is a shitty pet owner, plain and simple. The other day my husband told my friend \"hey, don't forget to feed your snakes\", and rather than do it right away, my friend said \"yeah I need to feed them\" and starts to walk away. As she's doing so, she gets a call from her sister asking if she wants to play Fortnite. What does my friend do? *Immediately* says \"hell yea I'll play!\" and opens the game. I'm sorry but they're not my pets. I keep trying to get my friend to be a responsible pet owner, but I can only do so much before I eventually get tired of trying to take care of other people's animals.\n\nSo yeah, Am I The Asshole for refusing to be a fucking pet setter and live-in maid and clean up after everyone else?", "created_utc": 1667151619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhknaf/aita_for_refusing_to_be_a_livein_maid_and_clean/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you are paying rent, it sounds like a terrible place to live. Can you find a new place to live? It might also be a good idea to call animal control so they can find the pets a home where they will not be neglected.", "NTA, but why on earth are you and your husband living in such deplorable conditions?  Your friend's boyfriend sounds like a nightmare, and your friend has dropped to his level when it comes to basic housekeeping and pet care.  The only reason I could see for you to care for the pets and wash dishes would be if you are staying with your friend rent-free and wanted to pitch in and help keep the house running smoothly.", "ESH because you aren't paying rent. So she probably expects you to do the cleaning in lieu of rent and should have said this to begin with. Even if 5 people are living there one, her bf, is part time and so you and your husband are using at least half the electricity so you paying for that is only a small thing comparatively. Honestly if you moved into my house and didn't pay rent and only paid electric I'd expect you to clean as well. Although she is a bad pet owner and I totally see your point. Again this should have been worked out before you moved in but you need to have a sit down discussion now about it all.", "NTA and I certainly hope the new position means you can get into decent quarters soon.  But my heart bleeds for those poor animals.  I see that you are trying to arrange some rehoming, but I really suspect some of them won't survive your departure by very long. Please consider calling animal control.  They have every right to not be starved or neglected to death.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I Feel sorry for the animals when you do.", "I'd say NTA, even if she is paying rent. If there were terms that they agreed to when she moved in that she would take care of the animals in lieu of paying rent, then it would be different, but it seems like there was no such agreement, and she is just being taken advantage of.", "Idk if you'd consider it \"rent\", but we *are* paying the electric bill, and have been since a week before moving in (because at the time my friend didn't have a job, her boyfriend refuses to pay any sort of bill here, and it was agreed upon by me, my husband, and my friend that we could pay the electric). \n\nWith the \"moving\" situation: we can't really afford to move anywhere else. On top of paying electric, we're also paying our own bills like phones, car payments, food, etc., so its still a struggle for us. However the good news is that I just picked up a job with a trucking company, so hopefully before the year is over, my husband and I will be out over the road, which means we'll be making (more than) enough money to move out and get our own place. \n\nFor the pets: yeah, I've thought about it. If anything, she *definitely* needs to rehome her snakes, because between the dogs and the cats, the poor snakes are *THE* most forgotten about, and since I don't know how to properly gauge the temps of their food (like what's a safe temp for it to be at), I don't want to do anything with them because I'm afraid of messing something up and then one of them pass away because of it. I've already asked a couple other friends if they want a cat *(one of the cats my friend owns was supposed to be a foster, but even though the cat uses the rest of the house as her litter box rather than the actual box, my friend still wants to keep her)* and I'm waiting to see what my friend does about her boyfriend's buddy's dog who keeps peeing on the floor as well. So yeah, I've already been asking around to see if other people want pets.", "So originally, it wasn't the plan to live here. \n\n2 months ago, my friend had gone away to a family event out of state and my husband and I offered to pet set for them (at the time it was only 1 cat, 2 dogs and the 2 snakes). While over here, the family member that we were living with *(who is unstable mental wise)* had called us and started falsely accusing us of things like food missing and stuff being stolen (when we've been over at my friend's house that entire week), and no matter how much I tried to calm them down, they were determined to kick us out of the house, so we said fuck it and said we'd leave. \n\nWe didn't have anywhere to go at all, so upon hearing that my family kicked us out, my friend (who I've known since 6th grade) told us we can move into the spare bedroom, only thing we'd have to pay is electric, which was a pretty good deal for us. We had no idea that living here would turn into this ordeal. \n\nAnd yeah, for the first month of living here, that's exactly why I was helping with the animals and the dishes, because I didn't have a job, so I figured that I could pitch in and keep things going smoothly around here. However it became a problem because my friend is also refusing to do anything about the pets. I can tell her several times we need to get rid of the foster cat because she keeps peeing and pooping in this one specific corner of the house, and she'll turn around and say \"uh huh, I don't think the little kitty baby is the one doing it\" and coddle it like a child. So yeah, for a while I was doing it to help out since I wasn't working, but now that I picked up a job and now that I know I'm not gonna get any help with the animals, that's why I've stopped helping.", "Yeah, the harder it is to find homes for them, the more I'm leaning towards AC, even though in our area, AC's laws are pretty dumb *(I was told by Animal Control themselves that they won't do anything so long as the pet has shelter, food and water, all of which my friend can easily provide proof of. I hate it around here)*\n\nWith my job, it definitely means we'll be able to move into a better home soon. I just wish I knew more about snake care and was gonna be home more often, cause then I'd take one or both of the snakes from her :/", "Hit it right on the head! \n\n**There was no agreement to taking care of the animals prior to or after moving in.** The only thing they wanted from us was for us to pay the electric, which hasn't been a problem. I was only helping my friend with the animals because I love them and because I thought that I would be getting help whenever I did care for them.", "I am so sorry. This sounds like an absolutely miserable place to live. Maybe you could rent a room in an AirBnB until you get out on the road.", "I'm sorry that you are in this situation. The good news is that you will be able to leave it soon. The animals can't. Can you silently rehome or return the animals to safe places?", "No idea what kind of snakes she has, but none of them are particularly difficult to care for.  I used to have snakes when I was young.  You can get books a a pet store and they aren't anything as care-intensive as a dog or such.  However, if you are going to be gone for weeks at a time, that would be tough to handle.  Thank you for trying and good luck!", "If you feed them live you don't have to worry about temperatures and things.", "We've been looking into that and a few other options, so hopefully we can find something decently quick. Yeah, I'm kinda bummed that this living situation didn't really work out, cause aside from dealing with this stuff, living in an actual home *(rather than a trailer with thin walls and terrible family members)* has been nice. :/", "Yeah, I've been asking a bunch of other friends if they would like a cat or snake, or if they can't take them, I ask if they know someone who can. \n\nSadly around the area we live in, a lot of people try to rehome animals, so trying to find someone who isn't trying to get rid of a pet themselves is difficult. *(Doesn't mean I won't stop looking, though!)*"]}
