I cared for her for 7 years. When she died, she left her house to me. Her son (Uncle A) and I have no relationship since before I was born.  \nOnto the story;  \nThree days ago, uncle A stopped by. I have met him a handful of times because of Grandma\u2014he stopped in to see her once a year (New Years Eve) and wouldn\u2019t answer her call any other time. He started asking questions about the house, who\u2019s name it\u2019s in, who owns it, why I\u2019m here alone\u2026which made me weary. I said \u201cMy house is nobody\u2019s business but mine and I won\u2019t be answering any more questions.\u201d   \nHis questions made me uncomfortable because; he tried to sue my mother for her house. He bought my great grandmother's house despite the money coming from all of the family and it was meant to go in multiple names. When grandfather passed away a few years back, he also tried to sue grandmother for this house.  \nHe tried to guilt me, By telling me of the trauma he had with my grandmother and being raised not by her but the kids, to her second husband got to live with her. Before he could go on, I said \u201cYour relationship with her doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. I understand you have trauma but I don\u2019t know you for you to traumadump\u201d   \nHe got aggressive, asking why I didn\u2019t care about him. I explained that I barely knew him and that \u201cMy relationship with her is what\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t care about yours, the same way I don\u2019t care about my siblings' relationship with her.\u201d Just to emphasize that I wasn\u2019t ruling against him specifically.   \nHe demanded to know if it was because he was gay. If that\u2019s why I was choosing to block him out. This made me laugh. I told him no because I\u2019m a lesbian.  \nThen accused me of withholding her death from him. I didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t know\u2014again, I don\u2019t have contact with him! His siblings should\u2019ve been the one to tell him! But he insisted that as Grandmothers next of kin, it was my obligation to find him.   \nAfter that, He told me that I\u2019m taking away his right to grieve his mother by not letting him stay and by not going through her things.  \nHe started to raise his voice and yell at me, I have PTSD and it set me off. So I told him to get out of my house and not come back. That he\u2019s not welcomed here anymore. That, should he ever be here again I will call the police for trespassing.   \nYesterday, Uncle A\u2019s husband came over, yelling at me for disrespecting my uncle. Saying that I\u2019m an asshole. That I don\u2019t deserve this house. That I\u2019m just a dumb little girl who needs to grow up and get off my high horse. I slammed the door in his face and had a mild panic attack. But now I can\u2019t stop thinking if I did something wrong? I know that he\u2019s her son but she\u2019s dead now. This is my home. This is where I spent my childhood. This is where I\u2019ve been living.  \nDid I overreact?  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668558102, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yweckq/aita_for_kicking_my_uncle_out_of_his_dead_mothers/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole thing took nearly two weeks, he should\u2019ve known within that time. Thank you!", "All of her kids besides a certain few are awful people and she made it very clear of where stuff, money and property was going. They all got a decent cut of what little shit had. I\u2019m so new to all of this legal stuff and honestly didn\u2019t expect this to happen. So lawyers will be getting involved for whenever his attorney reaches out. Thank you for your kindness :)", "I was happy to open it up to the family once I sorted through her things \u2014 depression has been kicking my ass something fierce.

Even if it\u2019s to apologise", "Honestly I don\u2019t even know the trauma he\u2019s talking about either. It\u2019s not my place to question him but the other 3 siblings who didn\u2019t live with my grandmother have no ill will. And they moved back in with her as teens \u2014 my grandfather, the second husband, adopting them too. But you\u2019re right. They\u2019re both just horrid people. Thank you", "Yikes!! I didn\u2019t know I could be sued that way by faking an injury on my grounds. I\u2019m definitely gonna keep an eye on that. People really do be crazy these days.

You said he attempted to sue for at least two houses, there'd be records of that and if you have camera footage to show he intends to continue intimidation methods such as sending his husband in to rattle you, further evidence for your case.", "That\u2019s what a lawyer is for. It triggered an event and you\u2019re basically fearing for your life.", "Exactly. I 100% agree with you comment. I did what I could including posting it on social media. Grandmother was such a big help to the community that she even got a honour parade for the hearse. He should\u2019ve known. He lives near the town. Thank you", "If you can\u2019t or even if you can live without the stolen photo, I would consider reporting it stolen and by whom. \n\nNot to be petty, but just incase you need to show he\u2019s been trouble to you in the past should his behavior escalate.", "**sign", "He's an adult, has been for a while. Whatever relationship he had, or didn't have, with his mother was because he chose not to maintain it. You've said he lives near the town you're in, so he can't use geography as an excuse.", "Hope you have insurance in case he falls down and yada yada he will try to take your house.l", "Whew! From what you\u2019ve said, he wouldn\u2019t have a leg to stand on to try to take the house. But from his history of going after your family members, I just wanted you to be mentally prepared so if he does something like that it\u2019s not out of the blue.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m sure you\u2019d never let him\nBack in the house again, never let him stay over. Depending on where you\u2019re located after somebody sleeps in a place for a certain amount of nights they can then qualify for tenants rights and it\u2019s a whole big thing. I can\u2019t imagine any reason why you would let him come and sleep at your house, but just putting that out there in case he ever tries to manipulate you saying he has \u201cnowhere to go and it\u2019ll only be for a week\u201d etc\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Stay strong! You\u2019ve done nothing wrong!!", "Depending on where you live, you can be liable for injuries that occur on your property. At least where I\u2019ve owned a house, this even extended to the sidewalk. Cameras may help protect you. I hope he wouldn\u2019t try to pull something like that, but he\u2019s already proven to be predatory toward you and it\u2019s best to be prepared.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry to hear of your loss. Best of luck to you \ud83d\udc95", "I\u2019m hoping this doesn\u2019t get any bigger than it is but I thankfully do have a security system in place.

I\u2019m planning on never letting him come back or even approach the property", "Much appreciated :)", "These attempts happened a long time ago. One before I was born (my mothers house) and the second being this house I now own \u2014 however, the details to that I\u2019m unsure of yet. I\u2019ve only heard my mother complain about it, so I\u2019d need more info from her.", "I posted this on the wrong comment originally but; The police around here are kinda shit. Like I don\u2019t mean to speak bad about them but the PTSD I mentioned, is from a stalker in my house, yelling at me and attempting to stab me \u2014 and that still took 3 years to get a restraining order with my court hearing \u201cadjourned\u201d 4 times for his trail. So I\u2019m not holding onto hope that this will be seen.", "Haha the pettiness in me agrees but it feels like too much work to go through with it. If he can keep a photo and stay out of my life again, worth it!", "He\u2019s over twice my age and I agree. I mentioned somewhere else that the funeral was even live-streamed for people who couldn\u2019t make it. He really didn\u2019t have an excuse not to know", "Definitely have to start working on that. I\u2019m still new to all of this stuff. This is my first time living alone ever, including renting or owning a property. So I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. Thank you!", "Your words are much appreciated! Thank you so much.  \nI never plan on letting him be in or near my life again. My mother made sure I didn\u2019t know him as a child, it was only living here as a young adult, that I met him so it\u2019s no loss to me cutting him out again!:)", "Thank you for your kind words and the advice. I had absolutely no idea. I need to look in to this more to keep myself safe. Much appreciated :)\ud83d\udc96", "Well done!", "My deepest sympathies on your loss, please, if you don't already have one, get some sort of camera system, even a ring doorbell, I wouldn't put it past him to try something, protect yourself. You earned what your grandmother gave you, he's a vulture, he didn't know she died because *he only bothered with her once a year*! No one kept anything from him, he would've known if he'd been a decent son.", "Did you have a lawyer? If so, we\u2019re they good?\n\nCops alone won\u2019t do much as it\u2019s a legal matter.\n\nAnd sorry you went through that. I do hope you can eventually heal from it.", "It\u2019s not for pettiness it\u2019s for the record should you require it.", "Thanks ! :)", "Thank you! And yes. He wasn\u2019t the best lawyer but I\u2019ve never been in any kind of legal or police trouble so I didn\u2019t really see how much he wasn\u2019t helping until about a year or two in. My latest trial was just adjourned again last month so according to my new lawyer, we\u2019re looking at a January trial now.", "Thank you! It didn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me at first as it is just a photo. But you\u2019re right. If this gets bigger, it\u2019s best to have that info on hand", "Good luck", "Absolutely. You can even tell the cop you report it to that it\u2019s mostly for establishing a pattern in case you need it for court. \n\nMaking it clear you don\u2019t expect them to recover it for you or to press charges(don\u2019t say that part out loud) Rather you just want the theft marked down in an official capacity.", "Much appreciated for the advice and wording and making me realise the necessity for reporting this. I didn\u2019t want to cause a fuss over it but I\u2019ve been enlightened as to why I should. Truly does mean a lot. Thank you!", "NTA.  He\u2019s a bully and vulture.  Don\u2019t let him on your property, and don\u2019t speak to him again.  He wants something and wants to bully you into giving it to him.", "NTA they are nothing but greedy vultures, set up some cameras outside  (front door camera). You have earned the house and you deserve it, don\u2019t think for one minute otherwise.", "NTA.  Also talk about this with an attorney.  you may not have enough for a restraining order, but you can start laying the foundation.  From the sounds of it, he makes a habit of getting money by strong-arming relatives out of their houses.  The attorney can advise you on ways to protect yourself, and when to get the police involved.  It will be well worth the cost.", "NTA", "Get cameras and quick. I don\u2019t trust Uncle A.", "NTA. You held up in the face of loud bullying. My respects.", "You humoured him a lot longer than I would've.

So it\u2019s just me and my dog keeping a look out for now. Thank you! :)", "And he\u2019s never gonna find that with me now that I feel a little more braver. He\u2019s left with a photo without permission and that has to be enough now. Thank you!", "Thanks :)", "Thankfully I\u2019ve got cameras. A restraining order at this time however is not feasible. The police don\u2019t take these things seriously here so for now, I just have to rely on my cameras and my neighbours and hope he doesn\u2019t come back. Thank you!", "Thanks! :)", "Absolutely. There was a reason my mother never let me know him as a child and now as an adult, it won\u2019t be hard to cut him out again. Thank you:)", "Much appreciated for the kind words.

Thank you!", "I\u2019ve got a lawyer from a previous incident so hopefully the next time I meet up with him, I can get some advice. It just blows my mind that people can be so greedy. Thank you for the advice!", "Thanks!:)", "Already set up thankfully. I\u2019ve got pictures of them on both of these incidents on camera. So any more then I\u2019ll take them to the police to at least start something. Thank you!", "Thank you! It was scary and triggered me badly from a different event where things got much worse. The anxiety fuelled confidence is definitely a double edged sword\ud83d\ude05 much appreciated for your kind words!", "You are welcome and good luck.", "Much appreciated friend:)", "Thank you for your kind words. Thankfully I\u2019ve got security cameras and a camera doorbell with pics of him and the husband present!", "Nta\u2026. All the vermin come out the woodwork when someone dies they try to take what they can if they come back don\u2019t answer the door just call the cops that there are strange men lingering around your property because that\u2019s what they are to you strangers", "NTA. So sorry for your loss and having to deal with crappy relatives. My mom put her house in my name years before her death I cared for her for years before she passed. After she passed my middle sister took my deed to the house and tried to have my name removed. It didn\u2019t work. She also took a life insurance policy my parents had taken out on my oldest sister that named me as beneficiary and told everyone in the family my being named beneficiary wasn\u2019t correct.  Needless to say when my oldest sister died and my niece tried to cash it in guess what she couldn\u2019t since I had always been the beneficiary. Well I collected the small amount of money and gave it to my niece to finish paying off my sister\u2019s funeral expenses. Enjoy your house", "NTA get a cam that records for your door.", "Maybe get a heavier door.... so it slams louder in their faces. NTA", "NTA. Get security cameras if you haven't yet.", "NTA\n\nTell him you'll answer any questions on his yearly NYE call or direct him to your lawyer handling the estate etc.\n\nMake sure your grandmothers will is iron clad as he sounds likely to attempt to sue/contest it given his previous behaviour with things like this. \n\nHe had no relationship with her, for whatever reason. You barely know him. You wouldn't let a stranger roam through your house and this is no different. His siblings should have told him about her passing. He has alot of unresolved issues, but thats not for you to deal with, he needs a therapist who can help him, not you to be his sounding board as nothing he feels will be resolved that way.", "NTA. You did well . I recommend getting cameras for your property. Take care of yourself and uncle can kick rocks", "NTA at all, my condolences for your loss, it\u2019s always hard losing someone. As for that vulture of an uncle, no, that\u2019s offensive to vultures, that parasitic uncle jus cut off. He wants everything for nothing, I would recommend getting some security cameras up Jus to be on the safe side, I\u2019d also go to your local police station and explain the situation and jus say you\u2019re concerned your uncle may come back to the property to which you\u2019ve expressed he\u2019s not allowed on property due to his aggressiveness last time, this way if he does turn up police already have an understanding of the situation. Wish you the best OP", "NTA. Get some cameras set up and contact an attorney about a restraining order. My deepest condolences to you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA and if either of them come back, announce you're calling the police and if they don't leave, follow through. Definitely a solid no-contact call.", "NTA. But please understand, it sounds like you are about to be sued. Get prepared and find a lawyer in advance.", "I'm sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc9c . If they keep it up look into a restraining order and talk to a lawyer to make sure there is nothing he can try and do. He might try and react to this unfortunately because he's a scavenger.", "Nta. I would change the locks in case he has a copy of the key.", "NTA. Seems scary. Hope you don\u2019t run into them again.", "Did you overreact? No.\n\nOn the contrary, when his husband came to yell at you - you should have called the police there and then - that is intimidating and threatening behavior.\n\nMaybe you still can file some report - say you feel unsafe with these homophobic attacks (i mean, if he can claim that, so can you) and that you wish to have them banned / restricted - if they need anything or think they have the rights to anything they can go the legal way (discuss with lawyer to see if there is any merit etc)\n\nBut them trying to bully you - and almost forcing their way inside ?  \nyou underreacted if anything. If you see either one, grab phone have have 911 (or local equivalent) on speed dial..\n\nNTA", "NTA - Ok... here is the thing. If your name is on the title of the house and it was in her will that the house goes to you, he has no claim to the property. He can try but if you have title insurance, they will fight that for you. (former title agent here). \n\nAs for knowing about his mom, that should have been handled by who ever handled her estate. Not you. And this clown yelling at you in your home, nah.... you had every right to yell at him and kick him out. \n\nWe dont know what he told his husband, so that story, you may be the bad guy here but that is their narrative and not yours. And if they come by the house again, call the cops for trespassing and harassment.", "Nta. This is tour right and should get the lawyers and every authority involved", "NAH But, you must give him credit, he has his victim-of- life story down very well.", "And sending his husband to spout misogyny?\n\nGet some cameras, OP", "Two words: restraining order.\n\nKeep a record of all contact with your uncle and his husband."]}
