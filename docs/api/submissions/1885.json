And English is not my first language so please forgive me for any bad grammar.\n\nSo my brother (16M) is a person who would rather suffer than apologize or speak nicely to me and my mom. And the thing is that he wasn't always like that, he became like this ever since he started following a certain influencer on YouTube. \n\nThis month is when all schools write the final exam for the grade and on the days you don't write you stay at home.\n\nSo what happened was I(18F) was sitting in the car relaxing because I don't have a paper today. I have my driver's licence and my brother is learning how to drive but he doesn't have his licence yet so he can't drive unless another person who has a licence is with him in the car. So as he has an afternoon paper he has to leave the house around 12.\n\nAs I'm sitting in the car waiting for him to get ready so we can leave, he comes over to the driver's seat where I was and says \"Get out and move to the other side\". I said no that if he cannot ask nicely he can either sit in the passenger side or walk to school. (It's about a 20 minute walk from the house to the school, but 5 minutes by car). He says no and kept demanding I get out of the driver's side. We were at a stalemate for about 5 minutes.\n\nHe refuses and walks out the gate saying he'll walk to school. I guess he expected me to give in to him because 1 minute later he came back and said that it's too hot to walk(it's summer here) and that I should move. I said \"Is it so hard to ask nicely and show manners to me?\" and he said \"yes, that although I'm polite to others, I don't see a reason to be polite to you\". But I still refused to move so he ended up walking to school.\n\nMy dad is siding with me but my mom said I should have just moved and let him drive.\n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n\nEdit: You guys said to tell my mom so I did and guess who's going to the village next year\ud83c\udf89", "created_utc": 1667992602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqfyn0/aita_for_making_my_brother_walk_to_school/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should be walking in anyways as he's old enough and if the route is safe enough. I used to walk 30 minutes to school from 11. Good exercise and teaches independence. He's acting spoilt and disrespectful. My younger brother went through the same thing after watching the Simpsons. He started acting like Bart. Silly I know but it got to the point that we didn't want to be round him. The only person he didn't do it to was me as he knew I wouldn't take his crap.
