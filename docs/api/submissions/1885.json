I have my driver's licence and my brother is learning how to drive but he doesn't have his licence yet so he can't drive unless another person who has a licence is with him in the car.

I said no that if he cannot ask nicely he can either sit in the passenger side or walk to school. (It's about a 20 minute walk from the house to the school, but 5 minutes by car). He says no and kept demanding I get out of the driver's side. We were at a stalemate for about 5 minutes.\n\nHe refuses and walks out the gate saying he'll walk to school.

He should be walking in anyways as he's old enough and if the route is safe enough. I used to walk 30 minutes to school from 11. Good exercise and teaches independence.

Silly I know but it got to the point that we didn't want to be round him. The only person he didn't do it to was me as he knew I wouldn't take his crap.
