Even ignoring the fact that she's trying to work part time with two very young, very high-needs kids, that's a terrible time of day to dip out of parenting. Doing the 5-7pm slot solo is hellish. Doing it because your partner had decided that's the most convenient time to work out is worse. Which brings us to:\n\nb) you get to work out at the time you've decided works for you, and she can just deal apparently. She gets to work out if you happen to be available and offer to take the kids. In both scenarios, you're getting to choose the schedule. You'll agree to parent if you've taken care of yourself first.

You take over and she does whatever. \n\nAlso, 4-5 hours a week *in addition to work* is a ton of time where you aren\u2019t at home parenting. You\u2019ve given up your hobbies? What about your spouse who is home with the kids all day? When are you making sure that she has her time to tend herself physically and mentally?", "I don't think anyone the AH really here, I think everyone's stressed and exhausted though!\n\nA 3 months old is really demanding and I don't think at this point you should be going out for 5 hours a week.  2 year olds sure but a newborn is exhausting.\n\nHowever on the flip side I do believe that as parents we should get some down time aside from parenting and work because otherwise we burn out.   So I don't think she should be preventing you from working out at all, but maybe you could cut it down a bit for the moment while baby is so young?\n\nThe issue is though that you've said you've offered your wife the same thing (going to work out) and that she doesn't want to do that.  That's completely understandable - she doesn't want to leave the baby and she doesn't want to work out 3 months post birth (and maybe she doesn't want to work out full stop - I sure don't!)\n\nSo the fact is that you've offered her the same thing for her downtime but she doesn't want to do that thing so you're now offering her no down time. \n\nIs there something that she would like to do, in or out of the house instead that she could do for some time alone? Or, if she doesn't want to do that (maybe she doesn't want to leave baby like I said) could you perhaps offer to pick up some extra chores around the house (I'm super hoping you do your fair share though ) so that she can just have down time with less stuff to do?", "The \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment kind of indicates that she resents your freedom to just up and go.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to work out, but it has to go both ways.  If you are gone 5 to 6 hours a week, tell her to go out 5-6 hours a week to do whatever (gym, nails, spa, lunch).

Then you go the gym \u2018for an hour\u2019 which makes it 6/7 at least. By the time you shower, are you pulling *any* parenting or housework in the evening?\n\nThen you still go at the weekend \u2018when the kids are napping\u2019. Are they asleep the whole time? Are all the chores done? Which, with 2 very young children, probably not as it\u2019s never ending washing and tidying. \n\nYour wife is trying to communicate she\u2019s burning out (in every other country than the US she\u2019s still be on maternity leave with a 3 month old so that sucks already) and is also carrying the whole mental load as well as physical.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not working out. It\u2019s working out instead of being a partner and father. You\u2019re being very selfish. Change your schedule.", "When my 3 were little I remember looking at the clock just waiting for 4:00pm because my husband was very punctual and came straight home after work. It was a great stress reliever knowing exactly when He would be home. I didn\u2019t even expect him to do anything in particular, it was just great that I knew I would have help when I needed it.", "NAH. It sounds like you both have a lot on your plate and are trying to balance your responsibilities and needs. I think you have a right to work out and take care of yourself, but I also understand why your wife might feel resentful or overwhelmed.

It doesn't seem like you are neglecting your parental duties by going to the gym. You have also given her the opportunity for some free time, but has declined so she really has nothing to be angry about. \n\nShe doesn't want you working out for some reason and is trying to use these passive aggresive comments to get you to stop. You should just straight up ask her why she doesnt want you to go to the gym.", "As a mom, it took me years to realize I needed to do things for myself. Your kids are young and I can attest that the hormones made this realization impossible at this stage. My husband was deployed when my oldest was born, so by the time they were 6 weeks old, I was packing her up, driving 3 hours into the mountains and hiking with her. It was great! I didn\u2019t have family or anyone to watch her, so she came along with me when I needed to get out. I don\u2019t think you should give up what makes you happy and I hope your wife can find something non-kid and non-you related to do for herself. Other than the gym, what else would she want? Honestly, I only use the gym on bad weather days. Can she go for a walk alone around the neighborhood? Honestly, even joining a stroller walking club would be good. You can usually find those on meetup. NTA", "NTA for wanting to work out.\nWe're expecting our first child this week and I know that going to the gym or longer distance running/cycling Etc. Is going to have to decrease.\n\nSounds like your wife is probably also exhausted and has probably given up a lot of what she used to enjoy/benefit from.\n\nYou guys need to find a balance of what works best for the family unit as a whole. And unfortunately that's going to come at the expense of what you both want to do in your free time.\n\nLong story short, if your wife has an issue with how often you work out, there needs to be at least a discussion about it and likely some more compromises.", "NAH\u2026.but it sounds like your wife needs alone time and she isn\u2019t getting it. You need to sit down with your wife and come up wi to a schedule for her alone time as well. And then make that work so you both get your own alone time and space doing what makes you happy. \n\nYou probably want to set up a system of this is my schedule and work week, this is your schedule and work week, we have this time for chores and then tits time for personal time.

That means I\u2019m taking 5 personal time hours and I\u2019m gonna gym in that time.\n\nWhat 5 hours of personal time do you want to take this week and when would you like to take it? Do you want to go out to get your nails done and get a massage? Take a chunk of Saturday for you to stay home and her to do that. She wants to go to spin class three times a week at xyz time, ok if it\u2019s your gym time normally, sounds like maybe a 24 hour gym might be what you need to accommodate you both getting gym time, especially if you just go work out solo. Maybe leave and gym before work, or after the kids go to bed, maybe you get a babysitter for after kids go down for a few hours or something. \n\nWork TOGETHER to find a solution TOGETHER.\n\nLet\u2019s find a solution together.", "NTA. It I hope you\u2019re doing chores without being ask, you\u2019re walking around and looking and fixing/cleaning as you see.

Is she not as fit? Sounds like she might be insecure about her body and is upset that you\u2019re fit? Maybe she sees it as you staying fit to leave her.", "NTA. You don't have to give up everything when you have kids. If you did, everyone would be miserable. As long as she also has time that she can take to do her hobby or whatever, then it's fine. If she chooses not to do anything, then that's on her.", "NTA - Your wife has to check herself and her resentments because SHE refuses to make time for herself away from the kids. Maybe she expected you to sit under her left titty and make your whole life about the family, but you are doing the healthiest thing (physically and emotionally) by having some YOU time. It\u2019s not like you are sitting in some parked car for an hour smoking weed. Congratulations on finding a small way to stay YOU and be healthy. You have done nothing wrong and have no reason to feel guilty.", "NTA.  Any chance that a babysitter could be hired so the wife can go to the gym with you?", "NTA.  It's your wife's own fault she doesn't go anywhere or get time to herself.  People keep asking if she gets that dame option as you, COMPLETELY ignoring the fact she is willingly saying no to any time to herself or to get out of the house.  She's just like my mom, whine that she gets nothing/doesn't get to do anything or go anywhere/refuses to buy what she wants or needs while citing lies as to why she can't. \n\n\nIf your wife doesn't want to when you make many efforts for her to get those things, that's on her.  We all lead busy and exhausting lives.  Having a child doesn't give you the crown for being most exhausted and having children is not always the most exhausting thing in the world.

You'll get the satisfaction of a clean house and having worked up a sweat. Take your eldest to the playground so mum and baby get some one on one time and you get done bonding time with the eldest. Pushing the swing for ten minutes, running around playing tag, going down the slide 20 times in a row, is a work out. Maybe not a serious one like you planned, but there is definite joy in it. Take both kids on a walk in the park. Our two year old loves her little board on wheels that's attached to the stroller. \n\n\nOhh and since you apparently need your wife to point out chores that need doing you should hire a cleaner for a couple of hours a week (from your fun budget if that's at all possible).

It's there for moments like this as well, when something is wrong and you want to nip it in the bud before it escalates.

He reciprocates when I have something I really want to do, though my things are noticeably less time consuming and don't require leaving the house. The key here is communication. As a SAHM, I want nothing more than to maintain a happy & healthy home with happy & healthy humans. I'm sure your wife doesn't care that this is something you want to do and probably enjoys that you take care of yourself, but you're not being considerate to your family by just taking the time when you deem it best. This isn't something you have to give up, but it is something that will require more careful planning and communication.\n\nIn the early days with baby, husband had to work out after bedtime until he got older, because afteenoons and evenings genuinely are the hardest time for young kids. Once baby got on a stable routine, we could mentally afford for him to go at more reasonable times. \n\nYTA right now, but you can stop being one.", "YTA you suck", "Yes. YTA. 50 bucks says you wouldn\u2019t last a week caring for a 2yo and a 3mo all day every day while also trying to do part time work and keep the house up.

If I were you, I would ask her what the top three things you could do for her or the household or the kids are.

Exercise is so important and doing it a few times a week will help you be a better father. You can't spend all your time with your kids. You have to have a few hours to yourself. Would people be mad if you had to go to the doctor three times a week? You're not hitting the bars, you're doing something for your health.\n\nThat being said, could you go at a different time? Your wife sounds resentful, so maybe you could go when the kids are asleep. Also, are you offering to take care of the kids so she can get some time on her own? It shouldn't just be to work out. If you stay home you'll suffer, if you go to the gym she suffers. But if you're offering her a fair trade she should take you up on that.", "I'm sorry but NTA, I was a SAHW of 4. At the end of the day. Since when is being passive aggressive instead of using your words ok? If she would prefer him to workout other hours she should say those words. He's not a mind reader and he shouldn't have to search out hints to find what the problem is. At the end of the day their is nothing wrong with you working out. Just help out more around the house. Initiate a conversation asking what specific task you could do to help out more. Together come up with a new routine including a set time for each of you to have alone time to do whatever you please. If she chooses to not take her alone time. You should still proceed with the plans as if she was out of the house. I saw a great suggestion in the comments about going to a family gym that offers babysitting.  That would give your wife along time to do as she please. Encourage her to spend that time on her self care and not cleaning. But if you do your part and theirs still a problem. I would suggest she goes back to work full-time and put the kiddos in daycare and try counseling.", "A lot of projecting in these comments\u2026 your wife is clearly stressed because she doesn\u2019t also have something that\u2019s equally supporting her needs, but it also seems to be a difference in mindset about how having kids = loss of identity\u2026 \n\nYou seem to be trying to maintain some semblance of who you were before becoming a parent and take care of yourself and I think it would do your wife a lot of good to shift her perspective and see how important it is for her to do the same. It\u2019ll be much harder considering the physical and emotional toll of motherhood though. \n\nMaybe encourage her to start with therapy? Preferably a therapist who specializes in working with post partum mothers\u2026 or trying to hire an overnight nanny or one who comes while she\u2019s working from home\u2026 work with her to support her getting to the space where she feels good too instead of taking her frustration personally. \n\nNAH, just new parents adjusting to their new normal", "NAH,\n\nI\u2019m a mom with a 2.5 year old and one on the way.

He gave it up after I got pregnant (2020 lockdown) and hasn\u2019t been back since. I can see the difference in him. Working out and having that time was so good for his mental health and he had so much more energy. I keep trying to convince him to go back. \n\nI do agree with others that you should be at home after work helping with your kids. It\u2019s not fair to her in the slightest to be pulling almost all of the weight at home when it comes to childcare and house work. She\u2019s not a single mother. She has a partner. BE a good partner. With that being said, I think you should tweak your schedule or even where you\u2019re exercising. Save the gym for 3 times a week (1 weekday, Sat/Sun during nap time) and workout at home the rest of the week. Or you can wake up earlier and go to the gym in the morning before work.

I'm a girl and I get really sick if watching blaming and hating guys on here from girls. You do way more than a lot of guys do. Heck more than my ex did when we had kids. Just got done reading about a wife going on a week or two vacation the husband was having a hard time juggling work kids and got upset at his wife. Reddit called him the ah she needs a break etc a guy goes to a funeral a couple of weeks after they had a baby.  It was family that died. He got her help if she wanted she denied it and threw a fit. Reddit...he was a ah he just had a baby he should have visited family later in instead of going to family's funeral. Nta,  but take my advice don't ask on here the girls here are man haters. You and your wife both should have a bit of time away to yourself a couple of times a week. Huggss good luck give us a update", "NTA: you have the time and it\u2019s not disrupting any schedule. And working out takes 30 to an hour. She\u2019s just jealous that you get to work out (even though she\u2019s been given plenty of opportunities to do so) and she seems resentful of you for that. Honestly, she\u2019s probably just stressed. But you\u2019re definitely not the asshole for taking care of yourself and having one hobby.", "NTA. You are trying to be accommodating,  but she doesn't want to exercise when she has free time, or when you are watching the kids. You need your time as well. If it's only 4-5 hours a week, that doesn't seem unreasonable.", "NTA, yet. I can see that you would like a resolution. My suggestion would be to ask your wife when she would like some time to go to the gym- or whatever- and make that happen. Even if it means you come straight home from work. If it is to be a regular thing, then schedule it every other day, so you get your time as well. \nAs someone pointed out earlier- this won't last forever. The kids will be less needy at some point. But the resentments that build up right now can be crippling even after the kids get older. Don't let a temporary situation dictate a future break up.", "NTA but there needs to be a conversation with your wife about free time or the perception of free time. We had this same argument in the early months of our kid, and I'm surprised it didn't happen for you with the first.  Working out, for us, falls into a separate category from \"me time\" or \"free time\" because it's not really relaxing, but it is something important to us. However you categorize it, however you split up the responsibilities, make sure your wife feels like she's getting equal \"me time\"", "Based on your edit/explanation, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole\u2026 at least not entirely\u2026 but I DO think you and your wife need to have another conversation about workout schedules.  Somehow whatever is being communicated between you isn\u2019t materializing in a way where you both feel satisfied with the results. \n\nCould you try holding a conversation where you ask her \u201cIf you could have it all your way, what would your preferred schedule be? When would you like to workout?  How do you see this unfolding?\u201d  Then, based on her reply, would you be willing to shift YOUR workout schedule to accommodate hers?   I feel like an additional compromise needs to be made - from both of you.  \n\nAnd then, as your kids get a little older, your gym might have a kid care center where you both could work out without worrying about who is watching the kids.", "100%. The first 3-4 months with 2 was quite possibly the hardest part of my life, if my husband had been acting like OP during that period, I\u2019d have been making a plan to leave him.", "Finally seeing your comment (been too invested for the better part of an hour) is starting to get me cooled down but makes me so much more sad and disappointed for her. All of this shit in ADDITION to being a military spouse (of a pilot, no less), it\u2019s just spelling out possible divorce and lifelong resentment. \n\nI hope OP gets it in their thick skull sooner rather than later, because now they\u2019re likely to get some people into their business that they definitely don\u2019t want.", "She does, because she works over night and is breastfeeding", "The need to go to the gym part is really the issue, in my head. Like you don\u2019t need to do that. You NEED to focus on your family and your household. \n\n\nYou\u2019re so very right and extremely insightful, Grouchy_Toe2404.", "This!", "Or a stretch of sleep longer than 3 hours.", "I'm sorry to say we redditors are quite weak in comparison to the average Joes.\n\nHalf of my friends are working 12 hours, study, hit the gym, read, and STILL have time for hobbies.\n\nWe all downloaded a habit sharing app to compare everyone's habits live.\n\nYes, apparently some people are just hyper-energized productivity monsters.\n\nCan only say that I'm objectively lazy in comparison to them, I'm lucky they don't judge too hard and instead drive me forward.\n\nI truly have no excuse for myself after that.", "IT's one of those ones where they read the comments and then add edits to counter all the criticism.", "Don't forget the getting up throughout the night to feed the 3 month old. OP is lucky. If I were his wife I would be homicidal and OP would need to sleep with one eye open.", "She\u2019s probably not getting a healthy amount of sleep. I know quite a few people who claim they do this 4am wake-up\u2019s smoothly and something else always has to be cut back and unfortunately the easiest is to cut off more sleep.", "Fascinating,  I've never heard of hours for lactancy before, I'm glad you have options, hopefully it continues to improve.", "My wife and I did the same when our boys were little. Then as they got older, when we finished the workout we would enjoy the pool as a family. Now I wake up at 4:20 to be at the gym by 5 am. I get home around 6:30 and make breakfast and help get the boys ready before dropping them off at school. I don\u2019t watch tv in the evenings because  I choose to take my time in the morning. I take my tv time on cardio days, on the treadmill or elliptical. My wife can choose to do the gym in the afternoons, and we make weekends work, but a family bike ride or trail often takes the place. Get a bike cart or a running stroller. Model fitness for your family.", "I do this now!! (3 and 1yo) it is top notch.", "I was speaking generally about this entire subreddit, but now that you\u2019ve brought it up\u2026 it\u2019s primarily a husband issue, but while the wife means well, she\u2019s not infallible either. The wife is correct to prioritize the kids. If husband wasn\u2019t being so stubborn, she would be more willing to discuss ways to fit his workouts into the family schedule. But because of how he\u2019s behaving, she\u2019s understandably upset and probably doesn\u2019t want him working out at all. It\u2019s not a both sides issue because the husband is the core issue, meaning that if she ever reacts negatively, it\u2019s his fault - not hers - because he pushed her to that point. The issue is NOT both sides, but the SOLUTION will require equal input from both sides. \n\nOnce they sit down and start talking things out logically, the wife may find that there\u2019s ways to accommodate the husband in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt her or the kids. So the first step is for the husband to yield and admit that he\u2019s causing a problem. The second step is for them to work as a team to find the solution that creates the healthiest, happiest schedule for the family as a whole. It\u2019s perfectly possible for people to find time to work out when they have kids. It\u2019s just going to look very different from how it used to prior to having kids. And it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for both parents to be expected to care for their own children equally. Both sides want reasonable things, and I think that if they approach this with empathy and creativity, they will find a solution that works.", "I can\u2019t imagine anything lonelier then raising kids with a straight dude and no emotional support."]}
