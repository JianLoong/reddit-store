Which brings us to:\n\nb) you get to work out at the time you've decided works for you, and she can just deal apparently.

So I don't think she should be preventing you from working out at all, but maybe you could cut it down a bit for the moment while baby is so young?\n\nThe issue is though that you've said you've offered your wife the same thing (going to work out) and that she doesn't want to do that.  That's completely understandable - she doesn't want to leave the baby and she doesn't want to work out 3 months post birth (and maybe she doesn't want to work out full stop - I sure don't!)\n\nSo the fact is that you've offered her the same thing for her downtime but she doesn't want to do that thing so you're now offering her no down time. \n\nIs there something that she would like to do, in or out of the house instead that she could do for some time alone? Or, if she doesn't want to do that (maybe she doesn't want to leave baby like I said) could you perhaps offer to pick up some extra chores around the house (I'm super hoping you do your fair share though ) so that she can just have down time with less stuff to do?", "The \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment kind of indicates that she resents your freedom to just up and go.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to work out, but it has to go both ways.

Your kids are young and I can attest that the hormones made this realization impossible at this stage. My husband was deployed when my oldest was born, so by the time they were 6 weeks old, I was packing her up, driving 3 hours into the mountains and hiking with her. It was great! I didn\u2019t have family or anyone to watch her, so she came along with me when I needed to get out. I don\u2019t think you should give up what makes you happy and I hope your wife can find something non-kid and non-you related to do for herself. Other than the gym, what else would she want? Honestly, I only use the gym on bad weather days. Can she go for a walk alone around the neighborhood? Honestly, even joining a stroller walking club would be good. You can usually find those on meetup. NTA", "NTA for wanting to work out.\nWe're expecting our first child this week and I know that going to the gym or longer distance running/cycling Etc. Is going to have to decrease.\n\nSounds like your wife is probably also exhausted and has probably given up a lot of what she used to enjoy/benefit from.\n\nYou guys need to find a balance of what works best for the family unit as a whole. And unfortunately that's going to come at the expense of what you both want to do in your free time.\n\nLong story short, if your wife has an issue with how often you work out, there needs to be at least a discussion about it and likely some more compromises.", "NAH\u2026.but it sounds like your wife needs alone time and she isn\u2019t getting it.

She wants to go to spin class three times a week at xyz time, ok if it\u2019s your gym time normally, sounds like maybe a 24 hour gym might be what you need to accommodate you both getting gym time, especially if you just go work out solo. Maybe leave and gym before work, or after the kids go to bed, maybe you get a babysitter for after kids go down for a few hours or something. \n\nWork TOGETHER to find a solution TOGETHER.\n\nLet\u2019s find a solution together.", "NTA. It I hope you\u2019re doing chores without being ask, you\u2019re walking around and looking and fixing/cleaning as you see.

You don't have to give up everything when you have kids. If you did, everyone would be miserable. As long as she also has time that she can take to do her hobby or whatever, then it's fine. If she chooses not to do anything, then that's on her.", "NTA - Your wife has to check herself and her resentments because SHE refuses to make time for herself away from the kids. Maybe she expected you to sit under her left titty and make your whole life about the family, but you are doing the healthiest thing (physically and emotionally) by having some YOU time. It\u2019s not like you are sitting in some parked car for an hour smoking weed. Congratulations on finding a small way to stay YOU and be healthy. You have done nothing wrong and have no reason to feel guilty.", "NTA.  Any chance that a babysitter could be hired so the wife can go to the gym with you?", "NTA.  It's your wife's own fault she doesn't go anywhere or get time to herself.  People keep asking if she gets that dame option as you, COMPLETELY ignoring the fact she is willingly saying no to any time to herself or to get out of the house.  She's just like my mom, whine that she gets nothing/doesn't get to do anything or go anywhere/refuses to buy what she wants or needs while citing lies as to why she can't. \n\n\nIf your wife doesn't want to when you make many efforts for her to get those things, that's on her.  We all lead busy and exhausting lives.  Having a child doesn't give you the crown for being most exhausted and having children is not always the most exhausting thing in the world.

Based on the fact that she has to look after a baby and a toddler and work part time (all while being three months postpartum??), I can imagine the state of the house.

Being a father doesn\u2019t magically make it so you can\u2019t have time for yourself.  I would say sometimes you should just take the kids and let her do nothing, not only for her to leave.  Me and my wife had a similar string of arguments when I needed to lose about 100 ibs.  How we got over that was me asking what can I be doing that\u2019s makes this easier when I am away?  If the emphasis is on her asking for random things which were unknown then maybe you guys need to set a schedule to figure out how to organize your lives with the new child.  This will make her feel like she\u2019s involved with the process, bring out if there is anyone carrying more tasks than the other included work times and more importantly hold both of you accountable to the schedule you both agreed to.", "NTA. I highly doubt your working out is the issue here. The way she's passive-aggressive tells me there's a lot going on under the surface. There are a number of things that could be causing her to be like that. She could be jealous. She could feel insecure. She could just feel overwhelmed.\n\nI would suggest some therapy. To be clear, therapy isn't just for when you are pushed up hard against the ropes and staring down at divorce papers. It's there for moments like this as well, when something is wrong and you want to nip it in the bud before it escalates. In the past, people would seek out their tribal leaders, clergymen, or others to deal with these issues, so you shouldn't feel any shame seeing a licensed therapist. \n\nThey can help give your wife a voice in a way that's more productive than her passive-aggressive answers that leave you unfairly confused.
