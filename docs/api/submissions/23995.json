So I don't think she should be preventing you from working out at all, but maybe you could cut it down a bit for the moment while baby is so young?\n\nThe issue is though that you've said you've offered your wife the same thing (going to work out) and that she doesn't want to do that.  That's completely understandable - she doesn't want to leave the baby and she doesn't want to work out 3 months post birth (and maybe she doesn't want to work out full stop - I sure don't!)\n\nSo the fact is that you've offered her the same thing for her downtime but she doesn't want to do that thing so you're now offering her no down time. \n\nIs there something that she would like to do, in or out of the house instead that she could do for some time alone? Or, if she doesn't want to do that (maybe she doesn't want to leave baby like I said) could you perhaps offer to pick up some extra chores around the house (I'm super hoping you do your fair share though ) so that she can just have down time with less stuff to do?", "The \u201cmust be nice\u201d comment kind of indicates that she resents your freedom to just up and go.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to work out, but it has to go both ways.

Your kids are young and I can attest that the hormones made this realization impossible at this stage. My husband was deployed when my oldest was born, so by the time they were 6 weeks old, I was packing her up, driving 3 hours into the mountains and hiking with her. It was great! I didn\u2019t have family or anyone to watch her, so she came along with me when I needed to get out. I don\u2019t think you should give up what makes you happy and I hope your wife can find something non-kid and non-you related to do for herself. Other than the gym, what else would she want? Honestly, I only use the gym on bad weather days. Can she go for a walk alone around the neighborhood? Honestly, even joining a stroller walking club would be good. You can usually find those on meetup. NTA", "NTA for wanting to work out.\nWe're expecting our first child this week and I know that going to the gym or longer distance running/cycling Etc. Is going to have to decrease.\n\nSounds like your wife is probably also exhausted and has probably given up a lot of what she used to enjoy/benefit from.\n\nYou guys need to find a balance of what works best for the family unit as a whole. And unfortunately that's going to come at the expense of what you both want to do in your free time.\n\nLong story short, if your wife has an issue with how often you work out, there needs to be at least a discussion about it and likely some more compromises.", "NAH\u2026.but it sounds like your wife needs alone time and she isn\u2019t getting it.

She wants to go to spin class three times a week at xyz time, ok if it\u2019s your gym time normally, sounds like maybe a 24 hour gym might be what you need to accommodate you both getting gym time, especially if you just go work out solo. Maybe leave and gym before work, or after the kids go to bed, maybe you get a babysitter for after kids go down for a few hours or something. \n\nWork TOGETHER to find a solution TOGETHER.\n\nLet\u2019s find a solution together.", "NTA. It I hope you\u2019re doing chores without being ask, you\u2019re walking around and looking and fixing/cleaning as you see.

If she chooses not to do anything, then that's on her.", "NTA - Your wife has to check herself and her resentments because SHE refuses to make time for herself away from the kids. Maybe she expected you to sit under her left titty and make your whole life about the family, but you are doing the healthiest thing (physically and emotionally) by having some YOU time. It\u2019s not like you are sitting in some parked car for an hour smoking weed. Congratulations on finding a small way to stay YOU and be healthy. You have done nothing wrong and have no reason to feel guilty.", "NTA.  Any chance that a babysitter could be hired so the wife can go to the gym with you?", "NTA.  It's your wife's own fault she doesn't go anywhere or get time to herself.  People keep asking if she gets that dame option as you, COMPLETELY ignoring the fact she is willingly saying no to any time to herself or to get out of the house.  She's just like my mom, whine that she gets nothing/doesn't get to do anything or go anywhere/refuses to buy what she wants or needs while citing lies as to why she can't. \n\n\nIf your wife doesn't want to when you make many efforts for her to get those things, that's on her.  We all lead busy and exhausting lives.  Having a child doesn't give you the crown for being most exhausted and having children is not always the most exhausting thing in the world.

Seems to do 90% of the childcare and has already gone back to work (which is just absolute insanity). \n\nWhy should she have to have a third adult child who she has to direct and tell him what to do. Why can\u2019t he just take care of his children to give her time to catch up on sleep and recover.\n\nThey are his children too!", "Yeah, why dont she just arrange that and puts an additional workload on her, while he can enjoy himself  in the gym?", "I suppose I have no excuse. Not that my excuse was professional success or anything. I have no excuse.", "I feel like a young single guy is far more believable for me.", "I know a single mom with 2 kids, one of which is a very active 3 year old. She runs a drug and alcohol rehab center which is very demanding. She works out every day, gets up at 4:15am to do it.", "My baby wanted feeding more like every 2-3 hours at 3 months. Tiny ones are so demanding, you get zero time to yourself and yet OP is acting like it\u2019s a cakewalk to take care of a baby.", "I would like to hire her wizard ass. I only have one child and I can't even get this one to drop off to sleep today.", "I love this, and it's so true.  I would kill to have had my kids on a schedule like that.  I never understood how others had even one kid on a strict schedule , let alone 2. \n\nSchedule says you're not allowed to eat for another 15 minutes? Suck it up, buttercup. Want to be awake and eating,  baby? Sorry, the 2 y/o is only on hour 1 of their nap.  I'll see you in 2 hours?! Wtf.", "You shouldn't assume she can pump and will easily have a freezer stash soon. Some women struggle with that. Additionally, pumping it an extra chore so if she chooses not to pump, she is not the bad guy. OP needs to find ways to be more supportive whether his wife pumps or not.", "\"Just pump some milk\"... that actually doubles her feeding workload and so far she has no proof he will even make time to do it. And that's IF she's even able to pump while exclusively breastfeeding. Most women can barely get 0.5oz after feeding their baby. With my first I could only get 2 drips. She would have to spend weeks or months pumping round the clock, probably 10 times a day for 10-20 min at a time plus set up, clean up  sterilization, most of the times he wont be home to help  and while also taking care of two children (which makes being hooked up to a pump and not able to bend over very difficult), to build an over supply. And then, when they give a bottle and she doesn't breastfeed - she gets to deal with clogged ducts and possibly mastitis.", "But why should she get 2 or 3 days when he gets 4 or 5, when he already gets his lunch and coffee and commute breaks too?", "Of course people are making assumptions, it\u2019s Reddit", "She is communicating that she wants more help at home. Yes she is doing it in a passive aggressive way, yes it\u2019s assholish but is it really a surprise? She is 3 months postpartum. She isn\u2019t taking up his offer of more time to herself because she probably won\u2019t be able to enjoy it thinking about all the things she still needs to catch up on, which are likely never ending with the two young kids. He is shutting down her attempts at communication by refusing to compromise. It\u2019s not on her as much as you\u2019re making it out to be, and you\u2019re missing the point of the previous responders comment which was that he is not available when she needs him to be, and right now she is not even asking for \u201cme time\u201d for herself, she\u2019s asking her husband to cut down on his so she can have some help.", "She's 3 months post partum, working at night and looking after a 2 year old and looking after the place. When he's available is not likely to be when she can go.", "Word, these threads are sometimes hard for me to see who is replying to what \ud83d\ude05", "Did you read the post? OP has repeatedly extended the offer for the EXACT situation you described. She'a declined the invitation. If she wants to be able to do it some other time or on demand that's also fine: Say that instead of pouting and guilt tripping.\n\nUltimately, if your needs aren't being met and the other person doesn't \"figure it out\" on their own it's your responsibility to speak up and advocate for yourself.\n\nJust pissing on your husband isn't \"advocating for yourself,\" it's passive aggressively pouting. And the fact that pouty face continues even after he suggested he watch the kids while she take some downtime diays that's not the real problem. Or she would have accepted or mentioned she wants to go whenever she wants. She didn't do any of those things. That's why I don't think the schedule is the issue.\n\nI think the real problem is she doesn't want him working out *at all.*", "Third adult child?\n\nThis man gets his kids up, feeds them, works full time AND is emotionally present and is available at other times too! She chose SAHM, so yes, more childcare will fall on her because of their waking hours, dad spends most of his time at work so she can have the privilege to be a SAHM and only work 4-8 hours per week. That's a common tradeoff, not a sign of some creeping plot.\n\nIt's fine to be exhausted. Just say that!\n\nWhat's unreasonable is post facto guilt tripping. She is an adult with the ability to say \"I need you to watch the kids while I'm at the gym/reading a book/doing recreational activities\" when she needs it. They should setup a schedule for gym and \"Mommy Me time\" they can both live with. That's a compromise. No indication that's happening.\n\nYou know what's not a compromise? Just making shitty comments and demanding forever more an end to working out.\n\nAnd actually, she doesn't need to \"manage\" him, she needs to talk to him. It's actually a condescending and demeaning generalization, an example of plain gender bias, to claim he's an \"adult child\" that based on what we have here.\n\nI see zero indication of negotiating or compromising, and two people not communicating. Your point seems to be he should \"do more,\" well, how about she explain what she wants in advance, instead of through post facto passive aggressive guilt tripping?\n\nThis is not a \"feminism\" issue or a \"lazy husband\" issue, it's two people failing at basic communication. Two! Not one.", "What \"additional\" workload? Are you people on drugs or something and hallucinating? This is a conversation!\n\n*Why doesn't she suggest it and THEY arrange it?!* if that helps you understand.\n\n\"Arrange time with her husband\" clearly indicated collaboration. Or are you suggesting he should read her mind and know when she's fed up and about to pop and needs an afternoon doing her own thing?\n\nThat is totally unreasonable.", "Believe what you want", "Awesome dedication, I honestly don't know how people have the energy. Although i guess it's one of those things, once you do it for a while you have more energy", "Because it is for him. \n\nHe gets to go to work all day, then he goes to the gym and the wife does the night feeds. He probably parents for about an hour everyday", "That is not the point - I reacted to his way of refusing to take any responsibility for feeding the baby."]}
