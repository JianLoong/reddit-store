We both had previous marriages, I had five children prior to meeting him and he has four (not living with us). We have one child together. He has worked maybe five months our entire marriage. I started getting annoyed/burnt out because I work two jobs but he sits around smoking weed and play computer games all day. On top of that, he is a heavy smoker and goes through a pack of cigarettes per day. He spends money (my money) everyday on his habits, like frozen coffees every morning. I also had to buy stuff for my step kids, which I don\u2019t mind. He was not working when his son came to live with us for 7 months. \n\nHe only takes our son to daycare and picks him up. There are no kids at the house during the day, they are in school or daycare. Occasionally he will mow the lawn or wash the cars, basically minor chores around the house every other week. I asked him to help out more around the house and his response was \u201cI\u2019m not a b****h, I don\u2019t cook and clean. Also, I\u2019m not cleaning up after you and your kids\u201d He claimed that he has been applying for jobs daily for the past year, but no one contacts him back. That\u2019s complete BS, I seriously doubt it takes that long to find a job. \n\nWell last week I got really frustrated and told him that we should separate after our current lease expires next month and maybe re-evaluate it after he finds a job and can contribute to the household. He said he couldn\u2019t stop me if I wanted to separate, and preceded to mope around the house for days talking about how hard it would be for him to rent a room or find his own apartment, I stuck to my guns and told him \u201cyeah it\u2019s not easy to be an adult.\u201d After that, he miraculously found a job within three days, which was also infuriating. I think he knew that I wasn\u2019t gonna change my mind and actually put in effort to find a job. I told him that he is selfish and purposely has not been trying to work. He got upset and said I don\u2019t value marriage and I\u2019m not a good wife. Also, he stated that I don\u2019t even have hard work because I\u2019m a software engineer, so working two jobs isn\u2019t the problem and I must be cheating on him. I had a mommy makeover a month ago, I saved money for years to get the procedure done. He keeps saying now that I \u201clook better\u201d there is someone else.

As soon as you renew a lease he will quit or find a way to get fired and go right back to where you were before.  He's not a partner, he's a dependent.
