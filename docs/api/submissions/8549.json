You should've come up with a plan to talk to her abput it when you started getting serious, and she shouldn't have ditched you on the side of the road in the dark because she's got awful hang-ups and ideas about mental illness.", "ESH. see a psychiatrist if you want to reconsider treatment. Making that change wo telling someone you are seriously seeing is unfair. Also, her reaction is horrific.", "INFO: Have you told her about your mom's diagnosis and your experiences growing up? I imagine if you previously conversed about your mom's illness, and she was painted in a bad light, that could have influenced your girlfriend's thoughts and feelings. \n\nI will say, when people find out you've been hiding something major like that, it feels really manipulative. Like you wouldn't allow them to make a fully informed decision because you \"know\" they won't react well. That's a disservice to yourself and your partner. You deserve to be with a partner who you know will accept you, and you don't have to hide such major parts of your life. And your partner deserves to have all of the information about what they're signing up for so they don't feel tricked into it. \n\nI also think it could be helpful to examine your actions and behaviors over the past weeks. You may have been showing symptoms before the hallucinations that could have made your girlfriend even more nervous. \n\nI don't think you're an asshole, and without a clearer picture of what happened that night I don't feel comfortable calling her an asshole either.

I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH here - she was freaked out and not sure if you\u2019d hurt her as part of your hallucinations, etc.  She had every right to ensure she felt safe.  Schizophrenia, while it can be managed (as your proof of!), is lifelong, and those you love and rely on are better prepared to help if they know.  Do you have to tell anyone?  No, of course not.  But a significant other of any significant duration (and that\u2019s key here - not sure how long you\u2019ve been together) should know.", "She\u2019s an asshole for leaving you in your most vulnerable moment.

Say you had an asthma attack or an allergic reaction, would it be okay for her to abandon you on the side of the road because she didn't know about it ahead of time? Absolutely not.

You have to battle all of those fears, but that is the point. When you say you have it, all she sees is violence as that is what the tv has shown her.

You needed to tell her so she'd know how to deal with it. That's a really serious thing to just leave out.

She's lucky you found your way back home and were safe.", "Depends on how long you have been dating - if fairly new relationship NAH, and if a longer term, it was a lack of judgment (so still NAH) - there is a stigma against mental illness so I can understand why you wouldn't have told", "YTA.

You should have been frank from the beginning when things started getting serious.", "NTA. There's a lot of stigma around mental illness, people don't empathize with how frightening and difficult it is. It's easy for them to give advice without walking in your shoes. I'm sorry that happened to you!

Maybe not on the first date but I wouldn't get too far into a relationship without telling the person. If I were her I'd have felt blindsided.\n\n Schizophrenia can be a lot to handle and not everyone is cut out to emotionally deal with that. And many people aren't educated properly on what to do when a person is having an episode. Telling her up front may have forewarned her so she could calmly deal with the situation and helped you. \n\nShe is also in the wrong though. Her reaction lacked compassion and that sucks. You are not a \"f- psycho.\" You have a medical condition that needs treatment. I hope you get the help and support you need. Sending love and positivity.", "ESH.

You assumed that she would drop you if you told her about it, so you lied by omission, hoping nothing would happen.  Schizophrenia can't be cured, only controlled.  Learning coping mechanisms is great, but it doesn't prevent episodes from occurring.  She had a right to know what she was dealing with before she had to try to deal with it from out of nowhere.  Chances are, you have lost her. Not because you're schizophrenic, but because you weren't honest with her.\n\nI'm sorry.  I know it sounds harsh to say YTA, but this isn't some small thing.

From your description it seems like you were just crying and maybe having a panic attack that this unwelcome door has been opened to your life again, and you were obviously in need and required consoling. Should you have told her? Perhaps. However, she should never have called you a fucking psycho and kicked you out alone in the night. Your condition isn\u2019t ruining your life. It is okay. I\u2019m glad you made it home safely. Not all relationships work, and there is often heartbreak involved. This is a large red flag, and I suggest deeply reconsidering this relationship moving forward. If she attempts to manipulate you and say it\u2019s your fault for not telling her, this is not okay. She\u2019s an adult. She should be able to control her responses. If my 2 year old punches me in the face for no reason, I don\u2019t yell and throw him across the room. Her reaction was abuse.

But A) this did impact them, and that changes the calculus and B) honestly this was going to happen sooner or later, and you're probably better off it was sooner. No one's recovery is perfect, and slips are inevitable especially when you're making changes with your meds. Her reaction was super shitty, which is why this ESH, but she clearly did not want to be with someone who struggles with what you struggle with - you're better off knowing that now than if you'd held together until after marriage, children, etc. At a certain point you self-disclose for your OWN benefit, to know you're not getting serious with someone who will eventually reject you for something about yourself that you cannot change. \n\nWishing you better days ahead!", "YTA.
