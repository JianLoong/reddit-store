Legal or not around kids in the house not a good idea.", "Go sleep on the couch.  Dude can find someplace else to smoke, like maybe in bed with his kid or something. \n\nSometimes you just have to flat out refuse and stand up to them directly.  It's part of growing up in dysfunctional families.  Unless you believe that you are in physical danger, consider flat out refusing and ignoring their demands to sleep with a 12 year old.\n\nAsk them if they'd like you to call CPS and ask them for their opinion on being forced or coerced to share a bed with an non blood related minor or if they'd grab you another pillow and blanket for the couch and setup shop. \n\nBeing a pushover is very limiting in life, so learn at a young age to be able to stand up to ANYONE and EVERYONE (when appropriate).", "NTA. Everyone already covered the absurdity of you, a teenage boy, sharing a room and likely bed with a 12 year old girl you almost barely know.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is when you\u2019ve stayed weekends thus far you\u2019re on the couch\u2026 And they actually have a spare room?\n\nIf your mom wants you to be spending more time over there etc. why has this not been made bedroom for you?", "NTA\n\nDO NOT EVER sleep in that girls room, let alone the bed. You are a 15m, she is a 12f. You are both at an age where you need privacy. Your parents should not be putting you, nor her, in that kind of situation. \n\nWhat if you were accused of something inappropriate? Your Mom and Step Dad are way out of line putting his daughter and you, who are only related by marriage and did not grow up together, in an awkward situation. Your Dad is wrong that you can suck it up for a week and should not be putting you in that situation either. The Step Dad can suck it up for a week to not smoke and watch TV in the morning. He is the grown adult, who is a parental figure, and can suck it up to protect two children. NTA", "You can call the court and ask for your own representation. \n\nSame bed of non siblings not right.\n\nTalk to the school counselor.  Good luck.", "NTA. There are so many things wrong with this idea there's not enough space to list them! It's got red flags all over it. You and Annie are not siblings, you're on the cusp of adulthood, she is just a child. Has she been told about this? What about privacy for either of you? It's beyond belief that any adult would think this to be acceptable or appropriate.", "Wow I can\u2019t believe your dad would be okay with this.  No! Do not go over there if that is the reasoning.  Your mom/stepdad can sleep in the living room, and you can have their bed.  You made ample suggestions, just say no to going over there. Don\u2019t \u201cjust suck it up\u201d it\u2019s creepy AF.  You\u2019re uncomfortable with it, and it\u2019s really weird that your mom is fixated with it. Nta", "NTA. Siblings share beds yes, but generally at a younger age and not if they have different genders. And you guys aren't siblings to begin with.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable, just don't go. Since nobody bothered to have the custody changed officially there is not a whole lot any of them can do about it.", "This is super weird. Usually siblings of the same sex share but that's not this. \n\nStand your ground. Say that if they want you to visit then you get your own bed. The fact that they want you to come but didn't make a space for you\n\nAlso this is why your mom didn't want to go to court. They'd say no because it's not appropriate \n\nNTA", "Awwww ....NTA ....that just sucks.  It's not okay for you and your stepsister to share a room, let alone a bed. You could be accused.", "NTA, but this post sounds like the writing prompt to a very sick porn fantasy.", "NTA. Cabela's has a folding camp cot on sale right now for thirty bucks. A heavier one with a mattress is about sixty at walmart.", "If there's no bedroom for you, your mom isn't ready for any custody. That's why she didn't go to court to make this official  - the judge would have expected proper sleeping arrangements before allowing overnight visits.\n\nOP, talk to another adult about this. A guidance counselor at school would be a good resource. You need to stop this before it starts.\n\nWhat if your step sister accuses you of something you didn't do? She probably doesn't like this idea either and could see that as a way to get her room back.\n\nIt's nuts that your parents are at all ok with this.", "Hopping on the top comment.\n\nYou are not related. Your mother married her dad.\n\nThis is not right. This is not appropriate... And to be honest, there are porns that would start like this... It is just so wrong on so many levels, and that no adult in your live sees the problem is what makes me really sad. \n\nJust don't go...", "Oh lord, I didn\u2019t even notice the genders.\n\nI just assumed female because what parent in their right mind would let a 15 year old boy sleep with their 12 year old step sister.", "It would still be creepy even if they were full siblings.", "And how will this shake out for OP if the step sister makes an accusation against OP later?\n\nThis is a whole no-go of a situation.", "Ohhh,  she would shut that shit *down*.", "Even if she was the one who, used to sleeping in her own of course, rolled over onto him. \n\nFor sure no one would believe the boy if the girl woke up and got scared.", "I honestly thought OP was a girl until I reread the post.

You will have your own bed in a second.", "She values, whatever junk she is storing, more than a relationship with her son.  Throw the crap out if your son needs a bedroom.  What the hell is wrong with people.", "> And to be honest, there are porns that would start like this.\n\nPointing this out enthusiastically might make Annie's Dad decide the couch is available after all!", "My mom had me (f) share a bed with her boyfriends 15yr son when I was 14 after I moved in with her to get away from my abusive step mom and enabler dad. She just assumed nothing would happen and everyone would love each other, and the world was full of rainbows and sunshine. The son was actually ok. It was the boyfriend I had to worry about. Childhood sucks when you have parents who don't care about you.", "I was exactly the same! Also, unless the spare room needs fumigating or something, it\u2019s a couple of hours work, tops, to make it tidy enough for a relative to sleep in. Sure op wouldn\u2019t mind at all if their stuff was neatly stacked and he had a bit of room, he\u2019s expecting privacy (as is his right) not hotel-suite standards.", "Yes. Not to put too much of a point on it, but men, and especially teenage boys, experience this phenomenon known colloquially as \u201cmorning wood\u201d.

Especially one I\u2019m not actually related to.", "Good call, but his mother should be doing this, if nothing else to protect her son \n\nThere's no reason for this. I cannot understand how a father would be okay with an older boy who barely knows his 12 yo sharing a bad with her.\n\nIt makes me question the sort of man he is. Did his parents think this was appropriate? Does he come from a sexually abusive home or an underdeveloped country where everyone shares one bedroom? \n\nThis makes me so uncomfortable", "LOL honestly yeah, start maybe calling it the start of your porno. Might change things quick.\n\nNTA OP. It's creepy they're being so adamant about it."]}
