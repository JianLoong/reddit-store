But you are telling them that there is an issue with your response.\n\nYou've just given a bunch of strangers the main reasons for your weight loss. Eating less, eating better. Tell your family that.", "NAH but if you simply say \u201cdepression\u201d the awkward air will be one they\u2019ll never forget, it\u2019s an important lesson for them to learn.", "NTA: We as a society really need to stop commenting on other people\u2019s bodies. \n\nWhen I was at the doctor\u2019s office the nurse weighed me and said I\u2019d lost weight and I could tell she was about to congratulate me. I cut her off and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t congratulate me. It\u2019s because my husband died. The last time I lost weight it was because I was very sick, so I don\u2019t like it.\u201d When my mom lost weight unexpectedly everybody including her doctors congratulated her instead of trying to figure out why - it was was cancer.", "NTA. But maybe just tell them \"look, i went through a tough time, and loosing weight is the side-effect. I dont wanna talk about it can we just do the thing we originally wanted to do and not talk about it?\"\nThen you do not have to disclose anything in particular and people get the message. \nIf you just ignore or get pissed, will will also get pissed. Dont do that, do not be passive-aggressive. Just clear in communication. Also, people think they are giving you a compliment.", "NTA. I went from 235 to currently 138 in a bit over a year. People always ask how I did it so fast and I have to explain that it wasn\u2019t a good thing. I had untreated T2 diabetes and extreme unexplained weight loss is a symptom. Yeah I\u2019m healthier now but I was so sick I was about 30 points off a diabetic coma. My mother in law also always commented on my weight when I was really big, now she says I look sick and my legs look anorexic. I do not like comments on my weight at all. Definitely nta", "NAH. As a person who has lost a significant amount of weight (nearly 60lbs since January 2022), I empathize with your perspective a little. During my weight loss journey, I focused on changing my overall habits and foundation. In the process, I never cut anything out; like I still ate carbs, drank alcohol, indulged in the occasional sweet, etc. The key was learning how to enjoy in moderation. Doing that made it a lot easier to eat clean and exercise. The thing is when some people asked my weight loss \u201csecret\u201d or came to me for advice, they refused to believe how I achieved it and insisted I either had some type of ED or was doing something else and refused to disclose. That made me feel incredibly frustrated. \n\nI think it\u2019s natural for people to be curious though if they genuinely are trying to better themselves. I\u2019ve helped a few friends along the process who were sincere about it. One guy is an active runner already in great shape whose trying to get to that next level.  You could just say \u201cI eat better and am more active\u201d and leave it at that, and leave it at that without having to divulge personal issues you\u2019re not comfortable disclosing. Which barring any medical issues, eating better and being active IS how you lose weight. It\u2019s no secret, you just have to be willing to work for it.", "YTA. What your friends and family are asking doesn\u2019t sound malicious. Losing weight is HARD for most people. So it\u2019s natural for people to be curious about how you did it. \n\nJust tell them a simple version of what you did and then change the subject.", "They're happy for you, please realize that.  You're not NTA for your feelings, you're probably tired of being asked.  But don't tell them about personal problems, let people know exactly what you said, that you've started exercising more and cutting down on calories and eating healthier.\n\nYou should be able to tell your sister this, though, are you not close?  I have two older sisters that are both obese and I'm worried about their health and them living (we're in our 60s).  I'd be over the moon if they lost weight!  She's probably happy for you.  Don't worry that she's slimmer, that's how my sisters feel about me being smaller, it's not about her but about your journey.", "NTA -- People really need to learn that other people's bodies aren't their business. You don't comment on someone's supposed pregnancy, ask how tall they are, mention weight loss (or gain), etc. unless you are that person's medical care provider or in another \"need to know\" kind of situation. \n\nMind your own body.", "NTA. Weight changes of any kind can make someone self-conscious or uncomfortable in their own skin, and having other people mention weight fluctuations can be unnerving. A lot of people don\u2019t realize this though, so it\u2019s definitely worth getting some phrases in your pocket that deflect such questions!", "I'm sorry to say, but YTA because you are blowing things out of proportion! \n\nMost people probably mean very well when asking about your weight loss, or are trying to pay you a compliment. You don't have to make a big deal out of it, but your reaction sure does! Like, just ignoring your sister? That's an asshole move. How is she to know that she isn't meant to ask or comment on it? \n\nJust tell peole you avoid junk food and soft drinks and be done with it, they are not actually expecting solid advice from you on how to lose weight.", "YTA.\nYou sound conceited. It doesn\u2019t hurt to tell people the same thing you told us. People are happy for you, be nice.", "\u201cHow did I lose weight? I stopped drinking empty calories, reduced the amount of junk food I ate, and became more physically active. No secret. It wasn\u2019t fast weight loss, it was healthy weight loss that\u2019s maintainable. So what\u2019s new with you?\u201d\n\nNTA. \n\nDon\u2019t focus on what people are saying. Don\u2019t tell them you went through a difficult time unless you want to disclose that. Once you\u2019ve told them you\u2019re healthy, change the topic and don\u2019t further engage.", "NTA. I've been up and down with weight. People are so nosy. They should not be asking about it.", "YTA. Your friends are happy for you and asking advice for something that they likely want to achieve themselves, and your taking it as a personal affront", "YTA, you told us how you lost weight, so why can't you tell your friends and family that brief blueprint.", "YTA - And quite the dramaqueen.
