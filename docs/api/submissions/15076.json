James did it all from creating fake receipts but then taking the money for himself to trashing the house with a huge party while the parents are gone. I was never GOOD friends with James, but he was always around. We had a lot of mutual friends and I used to hang out with him here and there a few years ago but as we got into our 20s, I got into university and working full time while he continued sitting around at home spending his parents money.

Here\u2019s the breaking point of his parents:\n\nA few months ago, he got impounded for stunt driving in his Mustang GT with no muffler. Two weeks later, car is back.

So when the opportunity presented itself, I took it. The action being taken was basically accepting his car when his dad wanted to get rid of it. They have plenty of money and the dad wanted it gone. When offered to me, I took it and also used it to make money which I then split with his dad as well. I could be seen as an asshole, and have been called one because people say I should not have accepted the car. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole here, I simply seized an opportunity\u2026 which just so happened to be because James got in trouble and I benefited, however I had nothing to do with him getting into trouble.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dad gets some money back without the effort of listing it, you make some money on a car you basically got free, and James is no longer on the road which is a win for society in general.", "NTA at all. His dad wanted it gone ASAP and pretty gave it to you who he trusts. He's making some money back while you make a profit so it's still a win for both of you.", "NTA. \n\nBut it might cause some issues in your friendship.", "NTA\n\nThe dad made the offer and you accepted.\n\nYou are now renting the car out and sharing the proceeds with the dad, which you are not required to do.\n\nYou have no reason to feel guilty about anything.  \n\nGood Luck", "Great story, do you really suspect that you might be the AH though? Not sure what for. James made his own bed and his dad ensured that he lie in it. You are benefitting from his dad's solution.

Also, I think it's smart renting the car out and giving half to James father. To me, that shows a lot of respect which is always a good thing.", "NTA\n\nSounds like Dad is finally coming to senses about the person James has become.  Enjoy the car.  Being able to pay the father more, by renting, is a very good thing indeed.", "NTA \n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong for what you did in this situation cos James needed to be taught a lesson. Hopefully this incident will give him a wake up call.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI mean, it sounds like the dad is teaching James a lesson, and you get a great car for $1. Too good to pass up that opportunity. Plus, you give the rental money to his dad, so you\u2019re not TA. You would be if you rented it out and kept all profits.
