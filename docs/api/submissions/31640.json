You had a lot of options:\n\n1) Politely speak to her and ask her to stop. \n\n2) If you were concerned for the animals, speak to a zoo keeper and let them decide if an intervention was needed. \n\nFrom her perspective all she was doing was having an unreservedly good time at the zoo. You have no evidence that she was intentionally trying to upset or disturb you, but you intentionally upset and disturbed her. In fact, I\u2019d say that the fact that she stopped and didn\u2019t try to yell back at you or confront you demonstrates that she is someone who cares about not disturbing the people around her.\n\nYour girlfriend is 100% right that YTA, both for your behavior towards the woman and for humiliating your girlfriend in public.

There could have been little children around, and maybe she just didn't realize she was bothering people. Not everyone is entitled who acts badly... Just ignorant. And her stopping after you said it doesn't scream entitled to me personally. You could have asked her to stop and if she continued THEN maybe do what you did. So, everyone kinda was meh... But not really big aholes.\n\nEdit: for anyone who feels the need to down vote me, think first... There's also neurodivergent people or mentally handicapped people who maybe can't help but be loud. Are you down voting those who say he's TA in any capacity because you in fact are an AH? Because you like to just yell at people regardless of their situation? If you are, just don't. We don't care, it doesn't make you cool... It makes you incapable of proper logical thinking and willfully ignorant.", "I\u2019m going with YTA because I don\u2019t think you should swear where little kids could hear and I also think that sort of thing is best left to the zoo employees and volunteers.

Thank you.\" Starting out with STFU is just being a jerk.", "NTA ~~~ \n\nSomeone needed to tell her.

Good for you.", "YTA \nIt is also rude of her to scream, but as someone else has said, you never know for sure if someone is neurodivergent or has social issues etc, which blurs the lines of them being an AH for disruptive behaviour. Correct reaction is to speak to a staff member and ask them to have a word with the woman/her group because she\u2019s disrupting the animals. Being rude back only fosters negative feelings for everyone, and potentially very negatively affects someone is they do have mental/social/neurological issues.", "ESH, she shouldn't have been being so loud, but there was a much better way to go about saying it.", "YTA but here is why I think that:\n\nOnly because she was rude, doesn't give you permission to be rude and swear in a zoo with other people around.\n\nTake the kinder route, you don't know her situation at all. Maybe she has MH issues, or maybe this was her first time getting to experience a zoo and she was over excited...\n\n\"Sorry but would you mind not shouting, it's distracting and not going to encourage the animals to come closer to us.\" Would likely have had the same effect.\n\nBut OP, you chose to be equally obnoxious and try to embarrass her and her family, by shouting loudly \"can somebody please tell her to shut the f&\u00a3k up\".\n\nYou could have ignored her or just moved away, but you got irritated and lashed out verbally. It wasn't kind and there was 100% a nicer way to go about it. So, whilst the 'NTA' posts and posts saying you should have called her a monkey and that your behaviour was justified are getting voted up, I can see why your girlfriend wasn't happy with you, that kind of reaction is deeply unattractive.\n\nNote for the people voting me down: You agree with the OP because it is what you would have LIKED to have done, not because it was the right thing to do.

She would have been embarrassed even if OP walked up and spoke to her quietly.

Why is it his responsibility to tell a fully grown adult to keep their voice at a reasonable volume at the zoo?

So am I, but that doesn't mean our conditions or situations are reflective of everyone. Is that understandable? Some of those conditions listed above would require an individual to be taken care of, or as you say \"treated as five year olds with no self controls\" Please do some research.

There is no cage big enough for a macaw, in the wild they fly anywhere from 10 to 25 miles a day. I've worked with many parrots, they need so much love and care and they live 50-100 years, depending on the size.  It takes a special person to be a parrot rescuer, I would never take that on.
