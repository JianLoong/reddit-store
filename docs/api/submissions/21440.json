Just to get that straight out of the way. \n\nMy Wife has found a new job but here is where the problem starts. She will make significantly less money than I did but she seems to be completely oblivious and in denial about it. Whenever the topic was brought up by me, she shrug it off. When I told her  today that we have to reduce our running expenses by a good amount she got angry and accused me of  trying to make her feel guilty and miserable. I didn\u2019t do any of this. All I wanted to do was make a Mutual decision with my Partner regarding our finances. We will have 800$ less to spend per month and that of course means that things have to change. \nBut again she does not care and does not want to hear anything about it. \n\nShe called me an AH for brining it up and literally said that I am forbidden talking about it. She really thinks I want to guilttrip her into staying at home when I already quit my Job. I think she is immature and irresponsible. Am I really the AH here?\n\nEdit for Info: My wife wants to work! I would have been happy to provide for my family until the end of time but she is just not into being a SAHM. The agreement was her Idea too. First two years with the mother and then me until our boy can go to school. \n\nFor the people asking why I brought it up several times. Because she refuses to talk about spending cuts and I don\u2019t want to know what would have happened  a unilateral decision. We have to live with our new budget in A FEW WEEKS.\n\nINFO 2: I brought all of these topics up BEFORE quitting my Job. My Wife insisted on our Deal.

This conversation is necessary to your future and it has no bearing on anyone's worth. It's just the numbers you have to work with will be different in a couple of weeks than they've previously been.

It's great that your son was able to stay home and bond for two whole years, but I don't see why you wouldn't want him in daycare at this point. Socialization is important too!", "Your wife needs to get with reality.  Either 1) she continues to stay home and you work 2) she accepts the little cut back a little in lifestyle or 3) she agrees to daycare.  \nAny of these options are good ones, but she needs to pick one.", "So she doesn't want daycare for him, doesn't want to be a SAHM herself and doesn't want to face the financial realities of her being the sole breadwinner?\n\nShe's 100% wrong and isn't being reasonable", "I'm sure his wife is aware that she will earn less than he did. What's the point of bringing it up repetitively? If he wants to cut netflix because they can't afford it, then say \"I'm cancelling netflix\".\n\nIt's on him because he'll be the stay at home parent managing most of the \"running expenses\".

What? That makes zero sense. She wants to work but refuses to put her kid in daycare? Makes zero sense. I think we'd like the full story instead of your continued edits that conveniently fit your narrative,  yet seem to contradict themselves.", "I cannot believe these are two functioning adults.", "I don\u2019t disagree, I\u2019m merely asking for more info. \n\nMaybe OP values time at home more than work and finances? If so, you can\u2019t have it all ways. \n\nI suggested the list as a means of a starting point if she refuses to engage in the conversation which I agree is just ridiculous.", "It was incredibly shortsighted to quit before discussing budget and ensuring this change would fit your lifestyle. \n\nYou need to start searching for a job and researching daycares now", "I can totally understand that which could have been dealt with had they communicated when she started looking for work and before he quit his job.", "In Seattle and the surrounding suburbs--so basically, the entire county---daycare runs 2,000-4,000 a month, depending on the age of the kid.\n\nEdit: yikes.

The budget cuts are on you to figure out.\n\nmakes even less sense.  If we assume your definition that the budget is fixed costs other than groceries and gas, then what does doing the grocery shopping have to do with figuring out budget cuts?", "I will try it again for you. I will keep my promise FOR HER. I would have been happy to keep working in my job. She insisted on the deal! Even when I told her that we would have nearly a grand less to spend.

I think he just decided to say \"fuck it\", I'm quitting without actually thinking about how this was going to work. He says he'd be happy to support them until the end of time,  so why isn't he? Why can't they both work if they both want to work.  This whole thing is bizarre to me.", "He literally says she wants to work. If it doesn't make sense financially for him to quit, then guess what,  too bad. Your family's needs come first. If you choose to have kids,  you have to be flexible and do what's best for raising them. He deleted this comment,  but he responded to someone else earlier calling his wife selfish for wanting to work.  To me,  that is red flags all over the place.", "Wow what a way to talk about your spouse and mother of your child. You are definitely TA. Maybe she wants some independence from you so she can leave your ass.

You\u2019re wife refuses to discuss this issue but WHY?? Why is she burying her head in the sand and why do you keep letting her? Why are you both sticking so resolutely to your \u201cdeal\u201d when it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not going to work out the way you had planned? Why is childcare not an option? And, critically, WHY did you quit your job before figuring any of this out?  \n\nThe picture you\u2019re painting is you saying to your wife \u201chey we need to figure out how we\u2019re going to live with less money\u201d, your wife saying * no * and walking away, and then you going \u201cok well I\u2019m going to quit my job anyway!\u201d and that is not a functional relationship between two rational adults. I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting so many ESH s.\n\nETA in response to your edit - it doesn\u2019t really matter that you brought all this up before quitting your job, because you clearly didn\u2019t get any *answers* and went ahead and quit anyways. \n\nAlso I\u2019m getting a vibe that you\u2019re frustrated with your wife (understandably) but that you don\u2019t actually care what\u2019s behind her refusal to discuss it. I think maybe you\u2019d get further if you tried coming from a place of care and compassion and actually wanted to understand what she\u2019s feeling and why.", "Ok, then her reaction is quite confusing. She had prior knowledge to the budget change and yet choose to wait until now to have an issue with things? Strange.", "Absolutely", "She wants to work, but I don't think she wants to be the sole breadwinner. Meanwhile, he doesn't care who works so long as the kid is with a parent and not in daycare.", "He asked to go over these expenses so they can cut down due to her lower pay and she threw a fit. Are you kidding me with this response?", "By your definition, nothing he does at the grocery has anything to do with the budget.  Libraries are free and restaurants are something they would both talk about, since both (or the family as a whole) would have to cut back on that.\n\nIn any event, we agree that the family has costs other than groceries.  And that the family's income is going to go down once the two of them switch roles.  It is more than understandable that he would want to have a conversation with his wife about that, and it is very childish that she won't.", "Why is she burying her head in the sand? I know sooo many people who want a lifestyle they can\u2019t afford and everyday they bury their heads so that they don\u2019t have to face the reality of it or give up extras.", "Where does it say she doesn't want to be the sole breadwinner? If he doesn't care,  why doesn't he keep working.  An $800/ month is a huge cut. This just isn't adding up.", "What\u2019s the fit? She found a new job and when he brings up the lower budget she says yeah and to stop bringing it up over and over. What else is she supposed to say?", "Libraries take gas to get to, unless he\u2019s walking which is a decision he can make. He can choose to cook so that they don\u2019t go to restaurants.\n\nIf he has any specific things he wants to cut from the budget, he should bring them up. He shouldn\u2019t just mope about less money.", "It's implied by her refusal to talk or adjust spending habits. She's done being a stay at home parent, which is why she has a job and start date lined up. It's also heavily implied that he wants one of them at home since he would support her as a sahp, but will take the role if she doesn't until the kid is school-aged. It's pretty normal for people to have strong opinions (religion level) on who will take care of their kid until school age (first 5-6 years).\n\nOne question I have is can they even live on 63k? That's a very area dependent question but my guess is at his she's been making it work but money has been tight and the ask to move to her 63k is impossible without a massive lifestyle hit that would cut into essentials. So he could be delusional there. He was making maybe 73k ($800 a month more), so it's really deciding between being a family with a combined income of 136k or a solo at 63k. \n\nI think the arraignment had issues from the start. It's hard enough to disrupt one parent's career, but they agreed to disrupt both. That requires being frugal or saving for the transition. Maybe she thought he would change his mind. Maybe she didn't realize the drop in income they would experience, which is more understandable if they had similar pay before the pregnancy. Maybe she didn't actually agree, but just let him talk while raising concerns. She's clearly stressed, and he's just cheerfully saying an agreement is an agreement, so you have to go along. Honestly, I'm more sympathetic to her than him in this because of the finances, but there is a lot of critical info missing.", "Go over the budget and where the cuts will be like an adult?", "What are you talking about?  Did you read the post?  He won't even let him get that far!  He is saying \"we will have less money, so we need to talk about budget cuts.\"  And she is saying \"wahhhh I won't talk about that because you are a meanie!\"", "Did he bring up stuff he wants to cut somewhere in the OP and she said no?", "Did he say that in a comment? What I got out of the OP is that he keeps telling her they won\u2019t be able to live as comfortably and she finally got tired and told him to stop bringing it up. \n\nAgain if he has specific changes he wants to make, he should.", "Why are you asking me. I\u2019m going based on what he said. His complaint is he\u2019s worried about her lack of addressing the issue and then turning around and saying it\u2019s to make her feel bad for making less."]}
