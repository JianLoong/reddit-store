Just to get that straight out of the way. \n\nMy Wife has found a new job but here is where the problem starts. She will make significantly less money than I did but she seems to be completely oblivious and in denial about it. Whenever the topic was brought up by me, she shrug it off. When I told her  today that we have to reduce our running expenses by a good amount she got angry and accused me of  trying to make her feel guilty and miserable. I didn\u2019t do any of this. All I wanted to do was make a Mutual decision with my Partner regarding our finances. We will have 800$ less to spend per month and that of course means that things have to change. \nBut again she does not care and does not want to hear anything about it. \n\nShe called me an AH for brining it up and literally said that I am forbidden talking about it. She really thinks I want to guilttrip her into staying at home when I already quit my Job. I think she is immature and irresponsible. Am I really the AH here?\n\nEdit for Info: My wife wants to work! I would have been happy to provide for my family until the end of time but she is just not into being a SAHM. The agreement was her Idea too. First two years with the mother and then me until our boy can go to school. \n\nFor the people asking why I brought it up several times. Because she refuses to talk about spending cuts and I don\u2019t want to know what would have happened  a unilateral decision. We have to live with our new budget in A FEW WEEKS.\n\nINFO 2: I brought all of these topics up BEFORE quitting my Job. My Wife insisted on our Deal.

This conversation is necessary to your future and it has no bearing on anyone's worth. It's just the numbers you have to work with will be different in a couple of weeks than they've previously been.

I stayed home with my kids until my oldest was 3, and while I COULD NOT WAIT to get back to work, it was an incredibly emotional transition.  This is true for a number of reasons.  First, there's something that I heard once and it rings so true...society's expectation of women is to parent like they don't have a job, and to work like they aren't a parent.  There is judgement to choosing to go back to work.  There is anxiety about what that looks like with a kiddo at home.  Second, no matter how much we want to go back to work and to be a person aside from a parent, we love our babies and we're attached to them.  As trying and exhausting as stay at home parenting can be, it's also a really special position to be in, and losing that can cause some grief.\n\nNext - the job.  She's been out of the workforce for two years - while maybe that doesn't seem like a lot, with the way the world moves, two years can be huge.  She may be anxiously anticipating the challenges of that transition, of catching up to where everyone else is, of learning something new.  I'm sure you probably have had this same experience - once you have a kid, there is a part of your brain, even if it's tiny, that is always with that kid.  She may be worried about what that will cost her in performance.\n\nMy mental health was shit when I went back to work, so let me once again say that she is not handling this correctly, but if my husband repeatedly brought up finances, I would have bit back too.  The thing is, she knows this will have an impact...and it's entirely possible she feels terrible about that.  As women, we are often taught to support the greater good of the family, to take up as little space as possible.  She may be struggling with feelings about choosing herself over family finances, over your comfort, etc.  Because she's feeling bad about that decision, you bringing it up allows her to project onto you the fact that you are also upset about her decision to choose herself.\n\nSo, you are NTA.  And she is not responding appropriately.  BUT...maybe you could try a different approach.  I'm guessing, since this was post-worthy for you, and it seems like you both were able to come to a wonderful compromise before, this may be unusual behavior for her.  Slow down, get curious about where she's at, find out what her fears are right now, tell her how proud you are of her for choosing her own wellbeing.  Ask her if there are things you can do to help her ease this transition.\n\nFor many women (not all of course) they need to be heard and supported to manage their feelings before they can move to logic.  You may be asking her to do something that her mind is not capable of.  My guess would be that if you set aside the finances, just for a little while, to find out what's going on for her and to help her to feel loved and supported, she will be able to address the finance issue with you sooner rather than later.", "I think your wife might be projecting guilt she is feeling onto you.
