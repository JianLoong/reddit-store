Just to get that straight out of the way. \n\nMy Wife has found a new job but here is where the problem starts. She will make significantly less money than I did but she seems to be completely oblivious and in denial about it. Whenever the topic was brought up by me, she shrug it off. When I told her  today that we have to reduce our running expenses by a good amount she got angry and accused me of  trying to make her feel guilty and miserable. I didn\u2019t do any of this. All I wanted to do was make a Mutual decision with my Partner regarding our finances. We will have 800$ less to spend per month and that of course means that things have to change. \nBut again she does not care and does not want to hear anything about it. \n\nShe called me an AH for brining it up and literally said that I am forbidden talking about it. She really thinks I want to guilttrip her into staying at home when I already quit my Job. I think she is immature and irresponsible. Am I really the AH here?\n\nEdit for Info: My wife wants to work! I would have been happy to provide for my family until the end of time but she is just not into being a SAHM. The agreement was her Idea too. First two years with the mother and then me until our boy can go to school. \n\nFor the people asking why I brought it up several times. Because she refuses to talk about spending cuts and I don\u2019t want to know what would have happened  a unilateral decision. We have to live with our new budget in A FEW WEEKS.\n\nINFO 2: I brought all of these topics up BEFORE quitting my Job. My Wife insisted on our Deal.

This conversation is necessary to your future and it has no bearing on anyone's worth. It's just the numbers you have to work with will be different in a couple of weeks than they've previously been.

It sounds like it\u2019s still a consensual switch, but circumstances do often change in 2 years. It sounds like wife doesn\u2019t want a life style change but they\u2019ll be running at a deficit.\n\nThere are 2 solutions:\n1)wife tries to find an even better job, or a way to get over time; or\n\n2) OP goes back for at least a part time job to make up the $800.\n\nThere is also the 3rd option, which will resolve itself whether or not we call it a \u201csolution\u201d, but OP and his wife can just continue to not talk about it and the $800/month deficit will eventually take its effect whether or not they acknowledge it.\n\nBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s not ridiculous for OP to go back to work, even tho they had an agreement. You can\u2019t plan *exactly* how life will turn out 2 years in advance.", "I heard it makes you gay", "But he doesn't seem to have much interest in being a SAHD. His comments make it seem like he did this to follow through with the agreement. He was happy to continue working. So what the point? There are other options. \n\nBesides, they are obviously trying to do best by their child. There is nothing good for the child when the previous primary caregiver suddenly starts working 60 hours a week.", "Both of them WANT to work. That is the point. But they are not coming together to make a decision, work on finances, or otherwise do something like one working from home. \n\nThe wife does want to work. I don't know where you got the idea that she doesn't. She insisted on going back to work. OP said he feels forced to stay home and yes, inferred that his wife felt she had to be home for the first two years which is why they made the deal.", "Then she\u2019s left with a choice. Drastically cut back on their lifestyle and what they can afford for their child, or daycare and dual incomes. \n\nRight now there is no choice.", "We\u2019re well below the average here, yes. I pay right under $1k/month in the Metry for a good daycare and don\u2019t have to pay after care fees, but when we started pricing a decade ago before my oldest was born, some of the places within the city were already over $1k/month.", "Parents are the primary caretakers, even when the child is in daycare. Maybe you want to say 'sole caretaker'.", "I made zero assertions including the term \u201cprimary caregiver.\u201d Validating working parents isn\u2019t invalidating the important work of those in childcare. I was a teacher for nearly a decade, but I\u2019d never say I was raising someone else\u2019s children.", "I was an ece before having my own kids and I strongly recommend you revisit this mindset. It\u2019s super arrogant and simply not true.", "It's not a stretch, lol. Having your kid in daycare is still raising them. There are mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays, and eventually before and after school and summer vacation... \n\nMy kid goes to daycare 8 am-4 pm 5 days a week. I'm her primary parent. I'm her only parent.\n\nStop shaming working parents. \n\nIt's a weird thing for a daycare worker to do.\n\nOP NTA it's reasonable to take turns staying home if you can swing it. They're only little once. Budgeting is part of that.", "Yes, I was in full time day care. My parents divorced when I was 2 and my mother was my main guardian. They both worked full time because they didn\u2019t have the choice NOT TO. Not everyone is able to have a stay at home parent. My mother DID raise me.", "It\u2019s $800 less a month. They only need childcare if they\u2019re both employed. If he makes $4000 a month now, that means she\u2019ll make $3200. Combined that\u2019s $7200, which means they definitely can afford daycare (which for 1 child is sub $1,000 a month anyway)", "Lol this gave me a good chuckle.", "With your attitude, I'm thinking the same thing.", "He has said the wife wants him at home with the child and had been refusing to talk about the money situation. For sure NTA", "No where does it say they cannot afford it.  He clearly states that have to budget differently.\n\nShe is refusing to look at the budget to figure out where the cuts need to be made.  This isn't a new mom being scared to go back to work.  This is a child refusing to be an adult if I ignore the problem it will go away.", "There is a third choice... Don't change your spending habits, have a reduced income, and live off of credit and savings. Obviously, this is a terrible strategy, but it would work for two years. This is what it looks like OPs partner would prefer", "He\u2019s trying to communicate and your response is \u201cjust communicate!\u201d She\u2019s refusing to have an adult conversation. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve managed to pin the blame on him still when it\u2019s the wife who\u2019s acting erratic and selfish. Even in your edit you\u2019ve managed to blame op for his WIFES refusal to talk", "If you stop trying to blame OP for a moment and consider the most obvious answer it makes perfect sense. The wife is being unreasonable. She insisted on a dumb agreement, OP complied with her dumb agreement, and now she\u2019s trying to avoid confronting the reality of that dumb agreement by shutting down conversation.", "Why do you think it\u2019s not true? You often know more about the child than their parents when you spend the majority of your day with the child instead of the parent.", "I don\u2019t work daycare anymore but trust me most daycare employees say things like this to each other.", "Please point me in the direction of this <$1,000 daycare! My 19-month-old\u2019s tuition for full-time enrollment at a center is currently $1650. Month for month, tuition at the state college is cheaper than that.", "Bwahahaha, probably not. Unless they're in a very lovely place with low daycare costs.", "I'm very lucky that a friend wants to provide reasonable daycare for me, however, where I live you'd be lucky to find a daycare at all, and they average $1500/month. If you want a high quality one (good ratio of carers to kids) you're looking at $2000. I've literally never heard of it being as cheap as you mentioned in North America.", "It sounds to me like she wants exactly that - she wants one of them to be home taking care of the child and wants that not to be her all the time.\n\nOP was happy to continue working.", "No. He can make that conversation happen. I realize what it is the wife wants. I don't think she's reasonable. But he never should have quit until they worked this out. It's not about him or her. It's about their child. They both need to get their heads out of their ass and have this conversation.", "What they cut is also relative. What he thinks they can go without may not aline with what she thinks they can go without. My issue is that he took steps to quit already without solidifying this. I totally thinks she sucks. But so does he. All of this should have been solidifyied before he quit and that didn't happen.", "I paid that much for  daycare for my second child when he was a year old.  He's now 14, so I imagine it's much more than that now", "Manitoba, Canada.  There's a new initiative by their government to cap daycare costs at $10/day per child.  Yes, really.", "I paid 1060 for my youngest at an under 2 rate. He will be going to preschool this year, dropping tutition to 5k for 9 months (550ish per month).", "i pay 950 a month", "I'm getting the impression she wants to go back to work but wants him to put their son in daycare and work as well.", "But his wife is refusing to have the conversation? He said he keeps trying to make the conversation happen and she won\u2019t talk about it. You\u2019re right it\u2019s about the kids and luckily he hasn\u2019t quit his job yet but his wife needs to suck it up and talk with him and help figure out how it\u2019s gonna happen", "He confirmed it with her before he quit.\n\nIf he stayed at work even though she has already found a job their fight would be way different and he would be called an asshole for adhering to gender norms.\n\nShe is 100 % the ah here.  \n\nNo matter what he did there was a fight that was going to happen.  This way the fight is solely her issue.. he just has to hope their financial future is not in the cross hairs.", "We're clearly not talking about a civilized country like Canada, this is obviously from the crackhead country downstairs.", "Who pays the day care workers of parents are only paying $10 a day?  Is that part of your taxes as well?", "Not to be too argumentative, but where are you getting that?\n\nI didn\u2019t see that in the initial post, but at this point we have OP saying this:\n\n> I will keep my promise FOR HER. I would have been happy to keep working in my job. She insisted on the deal! Even when I told her that we would have nearly a grand less to spend. She forced me quite [sic] my job to keep my promise.\n\nEven without that clarification, you\u2019re assuming that OP\u2019s wife is asking him to go back to work and he\u2019s not mentioning that anywhere in the post.  Why assume he\u2019s posting in bad faith?", "But that's exactly what also makes him the ah. You don't change anything until you are certain about where things are going. He never should have quit until she had already done some job searching to gage the best paying job she could get. That would have brought the earning discrepancy to light. Then they could have addresses it before he quit.", "I just busted out laughing \ud83d\udc80 \u201ccrackhead country downstairs\u201d, indeed lol", "Yes, it\u2019s subsidized by the government and paid for by our taxes. Our daycare fees have gone down progressively in preparation for this over the last few years and by this fall will be $10/day. It\u2019s going to be life changing for so many families, and help women specifically. I\u2019m not always proud of the state of our country but this is a huge win.", "Looks like it.  The website with the information on it says it's funded by both the federal and provincial government, so, yes, taxes.", "Did you read the same post I did?\n\nShe has a job that's why they know the budget difference. \n\nHe confirmed the budget difference.\n\nShe told him she wanted to take the job which requires him to quit his for child care.\n\nShe is now refusing to figure out the new budget.\n\nWhere did he go wrong??"]}
