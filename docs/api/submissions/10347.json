Huge AH for threatening to get her child taken away unless she went to rehab. You two destroyed your relationship with her and probably never even apologized.

IMHO, as horrible as it would have been for the dad to have to call CPS if his addicted daughter were neglecting or endangering her toddler, it would have been the right thing for him to do to protect the child if the child were in danger and the addicted mom  refused rehab.  This way, another relative could have stepped in to care for the child while the mom got help, and both mom and child would have been better off.\n\nKeeping her parents in her life wouldn't be any threat whatsoever to the daughter keeping her child if the daughter were no longer using and jeopardizing her child's welfare.\n\nOP, what did happen to the child while the mom was in rehab?

Also, assuming the parents could or would take care of the child just because they threatened it doesn't address how the mother felt at being threatened. Nobody gets on drugs for shits and giggles. She was struggling with something major and they threatened her instead of trying to help. It's not the kind of thing that strengthens a relationship. Especially if she was abused in the facility. OP was heavy handed and needs to deal with the fallout of forcing the daughter's hand without caring about any underlying issues", "I think that offering to pay for rehab was a huge offer to help, the OP literally putting his money where his mouth was.  And if the mother got clean and is now able to care for her child safely, it was effective help.  OTOH, I can see the impact of the threat on the mother and on the relationship with her parents.

The only time we were able to, we had to get special legal permission which was only granted because she was in extreme danger of dying. The stress and fear of trying to find her and save her was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever gone through. I can\u2019t imagine what it was like for her.\n\nShe was, and still is, very angry with us for forcing her to get treatment. Part of me doesn\u2019t blame her, but we would do it again to save her life. She\u2019s also very angry about our abusive father and tough childhood. This, I absolutely do not blame her for. She\u2019s chosen not to be part of our family anymore. She is incredibly abusive and volatile. We only know where she might be because my parents pay for her phone and she will text them sometimes asking for small amounts of cash.\n\nMy parents have decided to leave her out of their will, at least for now, because they can\u2019t in good conscious give her a lump sum of money. She knows their home is open to her and she will have every resource possible (medical, therapy, etc) if she ever decides to come home and get help.\n\nI do not have a relationship with my father anymore, but I do agree with my parents\u2019 decision in this matter. It would be dangerous for her to have unmonitored access to money like that.

And if you do feel that supporting her wedding is still the right thing to do, then you should offer to pay an amount you can afford directly to one or more vendors.  Ideally, you should be the one who signs the contract (so if it's cancelled, any refund goes to you, not your daughter).  You might consider reducing your wedding budget by the cost you paid for rehab (,which can be quite expensive).  If that's not acceptable to your daughter or her fiance, you shouldn't give them any support.\n\nRemember, addicts (and former addicts) are often skilled manipulators.
