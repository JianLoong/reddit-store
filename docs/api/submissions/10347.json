She\u2019s chosen not to be part of our family anymore. She is incredibly abusive and volatile. We only know where she might be because my parents pay for her phone and she will text them sometimes asking for small amounts of cash.\n\nMy parents have decided to leave her out of their will, at least for now, because they can\u2019t in good conscious give her a lump sum of money.

If she has decided that her life is better without you, and her sobriety is dependent on not having a relationship with you, okay. But then, she also wouldn't be reaching out to you about money. \n\nYou made a conditional promise- you said you would pay for her wedding when you two had a relationship, it never occurred to you that she would basically disappear and still expect money. You are not obligated to give her money because you said you would years ago. \n\nMy advice would be to talk to her, and ask her where she has been for two years and why she didn't care to show up for these important moments. I think you want those answers, so you might as well try to get them. I have no idea how that conversation will go, but don't promise her any money. If she gives answers that give you any sympathy or understanding towards her, then you and your wife can tell her that before you pay for anything, you all have to work on your relationship. If she says she doesn't want to and just wants the money owed to her, well then you can decline. \n\nThis MIGHT be a window to finding out what is going on with her, and working towards resolution. This also might be an addict wanting cash. Or it might be in between- she blames you for her addiction and feels you owe her for how her life turned out- and that can be very toxic, and not something you need to engage in.", "If this was for a medical procedure or something really important, I would recommend to OP to go ahead and keep their promise just for peace of mind. In this case though, the daughter doesn't give a shit about them. They've not heard from her in 2 years and now she just pops up and is like give me money! Her behavior is not going to change, he's just an atm to her at this point. She's obviously not interested in re-establishing contact so I think OP would be better to just take that money and do something fun with his wife and son or maybe give it to a deserving charity instead. People need to be less reluctant about cutting toxic family members out of their life. Just because someone is related to you doesn't mean you have to stand there quietly and be mistreated by them. Allowing someone like that to stay in your life is like the proverbial rotten apple in the bunch, they slowly poison everything that's good in your life until you're just as miserable as them.", "NTA\n\nWhen you're ready to book the venue, I'll bring the checkbook.\n\nWhen you're ready to sign the caterer, I'll bring the checkbook.\n\nWhen you've decided on a dress, florist, photographer, I'll bring the checkbook.\n\nPay for her wedding, you promised. Don't hand over cash, that's foolish.", "NTA. But neither is your daughter. She has behaved in ways that have hurt you and your wife.\\* It's your money to do with as you wish. On the other hand you had told her the money would be available, so she is not out of bounds asking for it. \n\n\\*I think it's obvious that there are deeper problems with your relationship than her having been involved with drugs and you urging rehab. If you are interested in having a relationship with her you need to be able to really listen to what she is feeling and to not argue...even when you disagree with her memories etc.  But that is up to you. However without such an effort I don't think you are going to be dancing at your daughter's wedding....or spending time with any future grandkids.", "This is what I was thinking, too. And if she doesn't want the family, she doesn't want their money either. Not a quality person. NTA\nEdit for typo", "She is her mother.", "Yes my wife and I did", "I haven\u2019t seen her in person in 2 years, I see photos of her on Facebook and she is with her mother", "I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s sober since I haven\u2019t heard from her. In the beginning my wife was texting her a few times a week, I\u2019m not big on the cellphone I just mainly gave her a call on the weekends. She wouldn\u2019t respond to any of my wife text. Then we would text her every few weeks asking her if everything was okay, how are grandchild was, eventually we send she was answering so we\u2019d text or call when family events were happening, inviting her to holidays, letting her know of emergencies.", "It\u2019s absolutely an asshole move to ask someone you haven\u2019t spoken to or made any effort to have a relationship with in 2 years for money.", "She was a heavy user. The father of her childs sister had actually contacted us to tell us our grandchild had been with her for almost a week which was suppose to be originally only for a few hours, with no sign of my daughter. Our grand daughter had a viral infection for nearly a month in a half because my daughter spent the extra money we gave her for antibiotics on drugs because insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it all, and we had to go and get it ourselves. If that\u2019s an environment you think is appropriate for a child, then possibly second guess your need to be around children. It was reasonable to threaten that. She needed help and it was no place for a child", "So maybe I knew more drug using people than you... But most people start using drugs because they're fun! They want to go out drinking and partying on the weekend and they end up hanging around with people who also use drugs. Everybody's got a different invisible threshold. Some people hit theirs sooner than others and once you cross that you're stuck.\n\nSo one day the whole group of friends is partying and having fun on the weekend like normal and all the sudden one of them just starts stretching it over to the week. Starts using a little bit at work. Starts doing it everyday. Suddenly one of them in the group is an addict. That's how it happens. \n\nI promise you if people were miserable the first time they did drugs they wouldn't do it again! They do it because it's fun. \n\nLast year there was a really sad story on the news locally here. There was a woman and her baby found dead in her apartment. The neighbors said they heard that baby crying for a few days but nobody ever had really good interactions with the woman so they didn't do anything. Turns out she overdosed the week before. That baby died of starvation. There's a very good reason why OP threaten to call CPS. And also as somebody who's been in a lot of meetings, if she was truly clean she would have made amends to OP. Not only that but she would be grateful because she would see that he really turned her life around!", "She either cut them out because they forced her to go to rehab, or she got back on drugs and cut them out so they couldn't call cps on her and have there grandchild removed.", "What was her addiction, and how bad? How was your relationship before addiction.\n\n There are many family dynamics where the parents think it is a great relationship, but there are ultimately deep-seated issues. Her wish to keep such a distance indicates there is more to this than just her addiction or your response to her addiction.", "And when she came out of rehab, she was resentful or felt shame? I'm only asking because I've been to outpatient rehab, and the majority of my group was grateful to the person/people who got us in there. I'm sure inpatient is more intense.", "I don't like children, actually. That's why I understand why she's not contacting you for anything other than money. No matter how bad she was, that threat destroyed your relationship with her. You and apparently most other responders seem to believe rehab is a magical place that makes everyone's personalities change. It doesn't. Whatever your relationship issues were with her going in, you had the same ones coming out. Drugs weren't the only issue here", "My grandchild\u2019s father and I had her. She\u2019d go between both our houses", ">So maybe I knew more drug using people than you... But most people start using drugs because they're fun!\n\nUh, you and your friends using drugs recreationally are not representative of most drug users. I learned what I know about drugs in college classes. The people who run rehabs also get their information from school\n\n>if she was truly clean she would have made amends to OP. Not only that but she would be grateful because she would see that he really turned her life around!\n\nYea, no. This is called stigma. You're assuming she was stupid and that being off of drugs magically fixes someone's life. It does not. You may not understand this but parenting is actually hard and stressful. Doing it sober is not some delightful pleasure for any mother. Especially not a single one. People's opinion of her changing =/= her actually feeling better", "She went between her fathers house and ours", "Before the addiction we\u2019d see her often. During it only when she needed money n it was really bad.", "You make far too many assumptions that make you look foolish.  They got along fine before.", "Would you have preferred my grand daughter starved? Or home alone for days at a time? At 3?", "You know, in NA meetings people actually talk about how they blame doctors for prescribing them and stuff like that. Blaming a doctor removes the stigma. But even if a doctor did get them addicted to painkillers... Nobody goes Oh yeah let me just go get something I can inject in my vein since I can't have painkillers anymore! Lol They all admit they got into it for fun. And these aren't my friends I'm talking about...this is 20 years of AA and NA meetings! Hearing addicts actually tell their story is a whole lot more accurate than the crap they feed you in school! \n\nAnd I'm not assuming it's stigma lol I'm assuming somebody that went through rehab over 2 years ago would have worked all 12 steps by now. At least once! Most people in the program work through it a couple times. OP saved her child from getting either taken away from her and given to OP or put through the system!\n\nI find it really funny and quite pathetic when somebody that 'took a few college courses' thinks they can tell addicts and alcoholics what's going on! Maybe you should take a college class on how many addicts actually go back to school and start working in a rehab! You'll be shocked at the numbers!", "You're not making sense. If they got along fine before, they would get along fine now", "I don't care. You don't understand why your daughter isn't speaking to you outside of money after rehab supposedly 'fixed' her. That's literally all I was explaining", "I'm not really getting into what they should have done so much as pointing out that actions have consequences. If the daughter got clean and then didn't want to interact, it's *highly* likely drugs weren't the only problem with both her and their relationship. They're usually used to numb pain\n\nI think there's a lot of context missing here that's being hidden behind the idea that people on drugs are always horrific and that rehab facilities never do more harm than good. Getting clean in a facility via having all civil liberties forcibly taken away doesn't necessarily keep people clean when it's against their will; it sometimes just makes them smarter about using\n\nThey may well have fixed absolutely nothing and made things worse by effectively removing themselves from the equation. They'd have been better off actually calling CPS if they truly thought there was an issue. Fear of losing the child in a concrete way would have created genuine motivation to get clean and fix her issues vs just needing to wait rehab out", ">Hearing addicts actually tell their story is a whole lot more accurate than the crap they feed you in school! \n\n>this is 20 years of AA and NA meetings!\n\nCongratulations on not understanding the really simple/obvious fact that not all addicts go to meetings. Have a great day"]}
