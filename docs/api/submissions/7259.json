Ever since he was a teenager, he's been suffering from severe mental health issues, and my needs were always swept aside so that my parents could take care of Evan.\n\nAfter Evan graduated from high school, he immediately fell into heavy drug use, and before long, he amassed a hefty rap sheet, including a weapons charge.\n\nAfter a few years of his nonsense, my little brother finally got his act together, and decided to enroll in community college. He eventually transferred to a 4-year college for a degree in physics. He seems to have turned his life around; currently in his 3rd year of undergrad, he's already published 2 papers and taken part in a few important academic conferences. He aspires to do his PhD in computational physics, has been clean for years now, goes to therapy for his mental health issues and is staying out of trouble with the law. He has many good friends and role models now, and whenever I meet him, Evan is always very polite and thoughtful, a complete 180 from when he was a deadbeat. I am SO proud of him. But even so, I cannot let go of my lifelong resentment of him, and sometimes, when he would talk about what he wants for his future, the only response I have for him is \"don't fuck this up\".\n\nThis past Christmas, my family got together for dinner, and Evan brought along his girlfriend, who he plans on proposing to. During the night, my parents still kept on heaping all the attention onto my brother, and how they're so proud of him and all that, and it reminded me of my childhood. At one point during the night, I snidely joked to Evan's girlfriend that his best trait as a parent would be pretending not to be shitfaced-drunk all the time. Evan took great offense to this, and in fact he started crying and telling me that there was no point in me saying that. I ruined the night. A few days afterwards, I had tried messaging my little bro, apologizing for what I had said to him and that I don't expect forgiveness from him. He's gone no-contact with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673640104, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b3ybd/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_dark_past_die/", "score": 506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then why would you insinuate that he would be shitfaced drunk as a parent. It looks to me like he's done a great job of turning his life around. But you, out of jealousy and resentment, have to focus on the shit he did in his past. We aren't talking about him acting better for a week or two. He is getting his degree and doing well.   \n\n\nI can't imagine how much that had to hurt- knowing that you still see him as a fuck up. \n\nYou owe him an apology, better than the one you gave him if you actually have to ask if you were being an asshole. And you need to do some work on your jealousy and resentment.", "YTA. You should resent your parents if they neglected you. Not your brother.", "YTA you brother turned his life around and you still want to shit on him. Talk to your parents they are the one you have a real problem with. Tell them how you feel and what your youth did with you. Go the therapy\u2019s holding on to this is toxic for you health", "100% YTA. He clearly is trying to be better and learned from his mistakes. You're just jealous of how differently you were treated as a kid. It's not his fault that your parents were like that. This situation just shows that you're a sad, petty human being.", "Holy crap YTA. Sure, in my opinion, Evan's GF should be informed about his past, but that's his call as to when/how to do that, not yours.\n\n(Also, as a computational physicist myself for most of my career, I wish Evan great success in the field.)", "YTA. You have all these great things to say about Evan and are even acknowledging his achievements, but are still reducing him down to probably his lowest point. Imagine how he feels knowing his older brother only sees him as a fuckup regardless of how much he does.\n\nYou're issue isn't with Evan. You're issue is with your parents. See a therapist and stop taking your anger out on someone who has seriously reformed his life. I hope Evan stays no-contact until *you* change.", "YTA, your resentment should be aimed at your parents, not him.  As for bringing up his past, total dick move there.  Of course he's no contact!  He's worked damn hard to dig himself out of the hole and do well now, and here you are kicking him for who he used to be.  Complete AH", "YTA I hate my brother, absolutely hate him. He has done and said some crappy things to me, Evan isn't the problem in this story. You aren't the problem in this story. Your parents are, they neglected you and you pushed your resentment onto your brother. You were out of line saying that to his girlfriend. What you said is not only disrespecting him but his girlfriend and her choice of men.

He had some trouble in the past and is evidently working quite hard to stay on the right path. He did the right thing to block you because your attitude and resentment is likely a real threat to his continued progress.", "Your parents neglecting you for your brother is your parents failing not his. The fact that he did a really difficult thing and you refuse to give him credit for it shows that you have misplaced resentment. He has worked really hard to turn his life around, and that is not easy. Especially when you're struggling with mental health issues. It's sucks that your parents sucked, but that's not your brother's fault and as long as you keep punishing him for your parents mistake, you will never have any sort of meaningful relationship.

He's cleaned himself up, gone to therapy, and matured into a good person. You however have refused to better yourself and are stuck in the past.

IT WAS YOUR PARENTS THST SWEPT YOU ASIDE, NOT EVAN.  You should be taking your anger out on your parents.  They are the ones that failed you.  Evan was off dealing with his own demons.  Quit blaming Evan.  Your parents failed you both.", "YTA you need to go to a therapist. Your resentment is justified but misplaced. You got shafted by your parents not your brother.", "Yta big time", "YTA. Most definitely. It is one thing for you to feel resentful of the attention imbalance growing up, and the attention imbalance at dinner  (feelings are real and we should acknowledge them to ourselves) but it is WAY out of line to act on that resentment, particularly in the way you did. He had no fault at this dinner. Frankly you should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA\n\nI get you felt pushed to the side growing up, but the past is the past. You say you are proud of all he's accomplished and how he's turned his life around, but feel the need to bring him down to make yourself feel better. \n\nJust be proud of him. It seems the issues you have aren't with him, but with how your parents handled the situation. \n\nContinuing to bring up all of his past mistakes despite his current successes, shows jealous and immaturity on your part and clearly has hurt the relationship.", "Well duh YTA.  How could you think otherwise?  There is literally not one redeeming sentence in your post.", ">After a few years of his nonsense, my little brother finally got his act together\n\nWhat you've described and chosen to call nonsense is the predictable struggle experienced by people trying to figure out how to live with mental illness. Using drugs to self-medicate is common and often leads to breaking other laws as well. \n\nYou have completely minimized his struggle, and you blame him as if he chose to have mental health issues. Your issue is with your parents and their prioritization of his needs over yours. You haven't written enough about that to know whether they were just triaging, and because his life was on fire, he got more attention. \n\nEither way, you decided to shit all over your brother's accomplishments at a family dinner. You also dragged his fianc\u00e9e into it by directing this ugly comment about him at her. What the hell did she do to deserve that? Not a fucking thing. \n\nYTA. Your brother has had to work very hard to overcome his  past. You say you're proud of him but when your parents expressed their pride in his accomplishments, it made you angry. That's a you problem and you need to work on that.", "YTA\n\nDo you have any idea what it's like to battle mental illness? I'm sure if your brother had been given the choice between being a mentally healthy person whose siblings received the same attention, or mentally ill to the point where he abuses substances to kill the pain with parents who HAD to give him extra attention, I'm sure he would have chosen the former.\n  As someone with siblings who battled mental illness, and as a parent of a mentally ill child who did their best to keep the balance of attention equal for all their kids, and not always succeeding, You.Are.A.Big.Fucking.Asshole", "Sounds like YT petty A. Instead of sniping at your brother, try respecting what he has accomplished. And put your big boy pants in and work out your feelings with your family.", "YTA. You need to seek therapy to help you work out your resentment. Yes it isn't exactly your fault that it developed, but you're actively harming your brother who has gone through a LOT. There's no excuse or reason to say such a nasty thing to him.", "I'm also the older sibling of the family fuck-up. It's hard to see them fail over and over again, and it's really hard to see them get all the attention when you're doing what you're supposed to be doing and not getting any acknowledgement. And for many first borns, we feel a sense of responsibility for our younger siblings. \n\nHere's the difference between you and I: my family fuck-up rage-quit on his own life. I would give anything to have seen him pull himself out of his deep dark hole and make something of himself. I'll never get that chance. He'll never get that chance. \n\nYou have an opportunity to build a mature, adult relationship with your brother. Nobody wants their mistakes rubbed in their face forever. He's moved past all of that, and you should be there to support him. You don't need to tell him not to fuck it up. I guarantee that he's constantly telling himself that. \n\nI don't blame him for going NC with you. You owe him an apology. You need to be there for him, or don't be there at all. But don't punish him for the past forever. How can anyone ( including you) move forward if you're so focused on looking backwards? \n\nGentle YTA. Apologize. It wasn't a joke. No one laughed. Get some therapy. Let him grow. Let yourself heal.", "YTA your resentment comes from a valid place by the sounds of it, but it\u2019s your problem to address and work through. It sounds like he\u2019s genuinely turned himself around, which is no mean feat. Good for him. Carrying all that hurt around will just be damaging you now, and it\u2019s your responsibility to find a way to work through it. Not just wallowing in it and throwing it in his face any chance you get. Bitterness isn\u2019t the way to go", "Kindly, YTA.\n\nI say \"**kindly**\" because it is clear that you were pushed aside by your parents. This was obviously hard to go through and has led to resentment. I recommend therapy to help you work through your very real and understandable feelings about Evan and your parents.\n\nHOWEVER, **YTA** because Evan has pulled his life together, and you throwing his past deeds in his face are undermining all of his progress and his current healthy status. This is not okay behavior. I am not surprised that Evan has gone no contact.\n\nEdit: Typo", "YTA. Your triggers are your responsibility, and you are weaponizing your trauma against your brother, who has worked incredibly hard to turn his life around. It sounds like you really need help processing your childhood and working through the resentment you\u2019ve built up, therapy would be great in achieving that.", "YTA. Stop being so jealous, you are an adult.", "YTA. Evan has turned his life around. You call him \u201cdisabled,\u201d but he seems to be in a much better place than you are now. The people you need to be angry at are your parents, for sweeping your needs aside like they did. Get therapy, and fix your own issues before calling other people out on theirs.", "YTA. It sounds like he really turned himself around, is making new healthy relationships, and it\u2019s sad that you\u2019ll miss out on having a good relationship with him if you continue to behave this way. I understand the resentment but you can\u2019t let the past ruin the future. I hope you are able to move past this and build a relationship with him. You will regret it later on if you don\u2019t.", "YTA. Throwing this in the face of a recovering addict is horrible. Sucks that he made your life difficult but he's not doing it now and lashing out just makes you look bad.", "You are definitely the AH.\n\nAnd you knew it before you posted this.", "YTA, you need to go to therapy", "YTA\n\nGet YOURSELF some therapy./", "Yta- you should be mad at your parents, not your brother, and I\u2019ve been there, your parents should have done better, should apologize to you, and try to mend their ways- have you thought about telling them how much it hurts? They may still not see their own bias if you have never talked to them about it", "Jesus fucking christ, you need therapy ASAP.\n\nWhat you did would make me cut you off too if you were my sibling. YTA", "Yta and just a bad person.", "YTA for misplacing blame on your brother when it should be on your parents. They pushed you aside as a child for things he had no control of, and they still push you aside because he's finally getting his life together. You should be addressing your anger and resentment with a therapist and your parents because they are the ones who neglected and continue to neglect you.", "Are you kidding? Definitely YTA. Jealousy and resentment is just never good and this post reeks of both. You should be happy for your brother whom overcame something that takes a lot of ppls lives bc they weren\u2019t able to beat addiction or depression or whatever it may be. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re seriously jealous of your brother turning his life around.", "Yes, YTA.  OP is resentful, but taking the resentment out on the wrong person.  The parents are the ones who should be getting the resentment acting out, not the person who did everything in their power to drag himself out of their dark past.", "Soft - YTA.  I will agree with everyone else that says therapy.  What you said was out of place, but it comes from years of emotional neglect from those that society tell you are supposed to be there for you.  I have no doubt that you feel like you will never be a priority to your family.  When your brother was in his dark time, all the focus was on him.  Now he is doing so well (and no doubt it took a lot for him to get there), but all the focus still seems to be on him and you are wondering where you belong with your family.  The right therapist will help you work through those feelings and emotions.  Hopefully there will be reconciliation, but if not, you don't have to make anyone (even family a priority when you are an after thought).", "OP I'm sorry for the way you were raised. Resentment is corrosive when buried and internalized. Get some therapy and try to move on with your life. Perhaps going no contact or low contact with your entire family will be helpful. \n\nYTA for your comment over the holidays.", "You really have to ask? YTA", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. Get yourself a good therapist and go 7 days a week.", "Yep YTA you projected your anger on the wrong person it's your parents you needed to vent at as they were the ones who were blatantly favouring him. Try therapy too.", "YTA. I was in a similar situation when I was much younger. Had a talk with an Aunt who explained to me that my sibling needed the attention, I was doing well on my own and didn't. Along the lines of the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Be proud of your brother for being able turn his life around, and forgiving of your parents who helped. Holding on to that resentment only hurts you. Let it go.", "YTA and a horrible brother.\n\nI hope your brother realizes he doesn't need your constant negativity while he's actively building himself up.", "YTA how should he feel motivated in succeeding if you're always dragging him back down?\n\nHonestly if I was him I'd get back to needling myself just to spite you", "I know how hard it is being the child who doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d care while watching your parents bend over backwards for someone who makes mistakes while you\u2019re expected to know better.

Your parents were the one who neglected you, not Evan. \n\nIf you hope to reconnect with your brother, therapy is a necessity. It won\u2019t be a fun experience, but will help in the long run.", "If you should be mad at anyone, be mad at your parents for not giving you enough attention. But don\u2019t insult him now that he\u2019s doing better for himself - and in front of his gf no less! Did you think they would laugh along with you? Do you think your parents will give you more attention now that you\u2019ve acted this way? Or will they see you as the jealous son?\n\nYou need therapy to work out \u201cyour lifelong resentment\u201d of your brother -> who\u2019s had a hard enough life without your jealousy and who has done NOTHING to you!\n\nYTA wow", "YTA. The thing is, your issues with your childhood are, while TOTALLY understandable, now a you-problem. Your brother got his shit together and is no longer doing anything to harm you. You don't get to take out your pain on him. That's selfish as hell. The time has come for you to explore your trauma and learn how to deal with it in a healthy, constructive way instead of lashing out. You are letting your pain fester, which is hurting you AND your brother. If you don't make a change, you're just going to keep hurting yourself. Not to mention lashing out and hurting people who aren't hurting you. \n\nThat being said, your anger and pain are SO totally legit. You're having feelings that anyone in your position would feel. Your reactions are also pretty damn understandable, if not constructive. Your reaction to your childhood isn't a problem. It's not Wrong or Bad. However, the way you're handling that hurt isn't sustainable for you or the people around you.\n\nYour parents shafted you in favor of your brother, which sucks. But that's not really on your brother, is it? That's on your parents. If you have issues with them (and yoy probably should, tbqh) that would def be worth discussing with them and/or a therapist, just so you can get it out in the open and start healing. Best of luck to you.", "Esh please go to therapy so this festering hate does not poison your life.\n\nEdit bro is n t a, parents are in the E s h", "YTA", "YTA, but gently. I get why and where it comes from, but you're off target.\n\nLet's talk about misdirected anger. Why are you cracking down on him when it was /your parents/ that neglected you? Gosh, I wonder what they did that he got super into drugs at a young age. That doesn't just happen.\n\nAlso, when you can, see about talking to a therapist. Not because \"lol u cray get help\" but because you deserve better than to live with all this bottled up resentment, even if it's very valid. Unpacking it will help you in so many ways, not the least of which being the ability to make actual progress towards a more fulfilling life. \n\nHang in there OP.", "NAH I can understand your situation you\u2019ve had a brother that got all your parents attention for his negative bad behaviour and now he\u2019s getting all your parents attention for positive good behaviour. I think you feel a little resentful that your parents are still giving all their time and attention to your brother and once again you are being overlooked. It\u2019s basically damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. I hope you talk to your parents and brother about how you feel.

Your problem was your parents. At least direct your resentment towards the right parties.", "YTA - if you have resentments towards your parents you should probably take that up with them or consider therapy \u2026", "YTA - of course you are. Your brother worked hard to do a complete 180 in his life and to climb out a deep hole mired in addiction and pain. At every happy moment, you choose to dredge up that pain and make comments indicating that you don't believe in him and and that you're waiting for him to ruin his life. Your presence is toxic.   \n\n\nIt's understandable to resent not receiving adequate attention and emotional care from your parents, but that's an issue with your parents, not Ethan.

Again, like you, my accomplishments were brushed aside, and my mistakes resulted in punishments WAY more severe than my sisters. All while she got the time, attention, and affection. \nIt sucks. It's not how you parent fairly. I took steps to go low contact with 90% of my family. My sister is not one of those people. Why? Because the behavior of adults was not something she had any control over. \nShe also turned her life around, and I am so proud of her and everything she does. It required therapy and healthy boundaries, but I like to think we get along pretty great.\nYour comment was hurtful and unhelpful. You holding onto all that resentment is so unhealthy. Get therapy, do some yoga, just do something other than being a prick.", "YTA. Do you know how hard and rare it is for someone with a past like Evan's to turn their lives around? Why would you punish him for something that was your parents' fault? Good on Evan for having learned to go no-contact with toxic family members. Get thee to therapy.", "You attacked the wrong person. Evan isn\u2019t responsible for your parents actions, and clearly you can\u2019t tell the difference?\n\nYTA. First, don\u2019t use other people as a scratching post for your unresolved emotions. Second, if you have beef with your PARENTS, then talk to THEM about it\u2026 instead of this bass ackwards jealousy thing trying to tear down your brother.

Ever since he was a teenager, he's been suffering from severe mental health issues, and my needs were always swept aside so that my parents could take care of Evan.\n\nAfter Evan graduated from high school, he immediately fell into heavy drug use, and before long, he amassed a hefty rap sheet, including a weapons charge.\n\nAfter a few years of his nonsense, my little brother finally got his act together, and decided to enroll in community college. He eventually transferred to a 4-year college for a degree in physics. He seems to have turned his life around; currently in his 3rd year of undergrad, he's already published 2 papers and taken part in a few important academic conferences. He aspires to do his PhD in computational physics, has been clean for years now, goes to therapy for his mental health issues and is staying out of trouble with the law. He has many good friends and role models now, and whenever I meet him, Evan is always very polite and thoughtful, a complete 180 from when he was a deadbeat. I am SO proud of him. But even so, I cannot let go of my lifelong resentment of him, and sometimes, when he would talk about what he wants for his future, the only response I have for him is \"don't fuck this up\".\n\nThis past Christmas, my family got together for dinner, and Evan brought along his girlfriend, who he plans on proposing to. During the night, my parents still kept on heaping all the attention onto my brother, and how they're so proud of him and all that, and it reminded me of my childhood. At one point during the night, I snidely joked to Evan's girlfriend that his best trait as a parent would be pretending not to be shitfaced-drunk all the time. Evan took great offense to this, and in fact he started crying and telling me that there was no point in me saying that. I ruined the night. A few days afterwards, I had tried messaging my little bro, apologizing for what I had said to him and that I don't expect forgiveness from him. He's gone no-contact with me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They are the ones who neglected you.

I understand how much it hurts. For a long time, I carried so much rage inside towards my sibling. My parents benefited from this misplaced resentment. As long as I was focused on my sibling as the source of my neglect, then I would spend all of my time and energy trying to earn the love and attention they gave to them so freely.   \n\n\nAt some point, I realized that while flawed, my sibling was not in any way at fault for the people my parents chose to be. My parents chose to ignore me in favor of my sibling. I did not immediately redirect that anger. Because it would have been the closest thing to killing god. To realize that my pain was actually a result of my parents' choices was devastating. I had no hero that was fighting for me the entire time. My sibling wasn't some clever monster that had brainwashed my parents into abusing me. They chose it themselves of their own free will.   \n\n\nIt drastically changed the shape of my pain from resentment to grief. A long process that included accepting the innocence (and even victim-hood) of my Golden Child sibling and fully acknowledging and accepting who my parents were. I grieved the death of my illusion of my parents. I accepted the people they truly were, went no contact with one and low contact with the other.   \n\n\nNo amount of vindictiveness towards your brother will bring you peace or even the score.

Stop acting like an ass and get some therapy.", "INFO: Why are you taking it out on Evan instead of your parents?", "I do.  My brother was \"the bad kid\" growing up, throwing me into the angel roll.  This meant I rarely got attention beyond \"keep up the good work, kid.\"  Once he moved out and ALL the attention was on me, my parents realised I'm fallible and so THAT became an issue.  I told them that I haven't changed at all, it's just that now they're paying attention to more than my grades and comparing me to his actions.  Luckily for me, that slapped the shit out of them, they apologised and we're all good.  They've also acknowledged and apologised since, though it's not necessary to me.\n\nMy brother got his shit together in his mid-40s and has acknowledged and atoned for his past.  He's a kickass dude and I'm really happy to have him for my brother!  Occasionally our childhood will come up, but it's all light-hearted because *that's not who he is now*.  We don't reference specific behaviours, incidents, and related fuckery.  It's just not necessary.  He's more than proven that he's not that person anymore.  Could he fuck up again?
