You absolutely deserve it though! \n\n& again, as others have said, it's time for you to think about your boundaries.

You are not an asshole for putting your self first that is a given. And now I understand you want to have a good relationship with your nephew but you dont have to be a push over and ruin months of planning. Also make sure when your little sister dumps the nephew on you that you actually get paid for your time and not the little sister.

First of all, you're allowed to have your gf in the 1st place, he is not your child - that doesn't mean you don't love him. 2nd, why doesn't she use that same logic on your younger sister? Either way, you need to stand your ground because they have the wrong idea about what a sibling's responsibility should be towards one's child - it's also weird that your younger sister needs to watch him all the time.
