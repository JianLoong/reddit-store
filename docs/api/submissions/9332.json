{"id": 9332, "submission_id": "10vpfad", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out after he made a joke which I found very inappropriate and disgusting?", "selftext": "Apologies for the long post ahead. \n\nFor some context: I (F21) have been dating my bf (M21) Ryan for the past 7-8 months. He is a born american with south asian family and I was born in south asia; moved to the states when I was 12. \n\nMy cousin Akash (M24) is visiting the town for a few days. He lives by himself in a different state and doesn't have the best relationship with his parents so we don't see him much nowadays. Growing up I was really close with this cousin and a few others who are basically siblings to me since we all lived in the same block back in our home country. \n\nMy parents invited him over for dinner and I drove him to my new apartment after dinner to show him my new place and hangout with two other cousins. My bf has met my other cousins but not him so he asked if he could join us and hangout and I said for sure.\n\n Akash and I were just catching up while everyone was on their way. During the conversation a lot of our childhood stories came up and I got sentimental. We were also bonding over some of the childhood trauma we experienced and how it affected us. I started sobbing as I was telling him how much I missed our group and I'm so happy we are all gonna be together after a long time. He consoled me and patted my head saying how proud he is of me that his little sister is now such a responsible grownup and stuff. My bf walked into the living room at that moment and saw me leaning my head on his shoulder and crying. He blurted out \"ayo what in the alabama shit is going on\" and started laughing hysterically. \n\nMy face turned red in embarrassment and I could barely mumble \"what\". Akash stood up and firmly said \"excuse me? do we have a problem here?\" and asked me if this is my bf. Then I asked bf what's wrong with you? who starts a conversation like that? He got even more defensive and said \"dont desi people marry their cousins all the time? It's funny bc it's true.\" \n\nWell I didn't find it funny and was enraging with embarrassment so I asked him to leave immediately before others get here. He tried to argue and say hi to Akash but I didn't leave any space for explanation and held the door open until he got out. I turned my phone off when he started blasting my phone with texts demanding to speak. My other cousins arrived shortly and we all had a great time catching up. When I woke up in the morning and turned my phone on I saw tons of missed calls and texts from my bf. He even posted some passive aggressive stuff on social media without mentioning my name. \n\nHe said how I overreacted to a very simple joke and turned him into the bad guy and I said if your first thought is to make such a cheap disgusting joke in front of someone who you literally saw for the first time then you really need to work on your humor and hung up. I'm still very upset and embarrassed and asked Akash to not tell anyone about it yet.

That was a cheap and disgusting joke, especially in front of someone he doesn't know and especially when he has no idea of the tone of the room.\n\nI'm not loving, either, the text bombardment or the passive aggressive posts.

That wasn't cool to say in the first place but its also concerning that he couldn't walk up and assess that situation appropriately. It wasn't the time for a joke - never mind that joke", "Sounds like bf is insecure. Doubling down on the quote instead of apologising is real mature. Please think back and see if he has been like this in the past.

If he felt that was an ok joke but it was that upsetting for you then I think you two might need to have a genuine discussion over cultural differences.\n\nThe US has normalized a LOT of crap like this (\"step family\" porn, casual jokes about \"Alabama incest\" etc) and it's possible he truly didn't realize this would be so hurtful to you.\n\nHis follow up with calls texts and passive aggressive social stuff is stupid, but how you want to handle it now is, of course, up to you.", "NTA\n\nI personally happen to see little wrong with your boyfriend's humor (though \"mansplaining\" the joke with reference to race or culture was deeply inappropriate), but he must accept that the price of being crass and offensive is to suffer your wrath! Serious disrespect should have serious consequences. By trying to blame you for overreacting, he's the one making this into a bigger deal than it is.\n\n\\[Edit: The tons of missed calls and texts is a big red flag that he's not willing to respect boundaries or when he needs to be put in the doghouse.\\]", "Lol that's funny.
