He is a born american with south asian family and I was born in south asia; moved to the states when I was 12. \n\nMy cousin Akash (M24) is visiting the town for a few days. He lives by himself in a different state and doesn't have the best relationship with his parents so we don't see him much nowadays. Growing up I was really close with this cousin and a few others who are basically siblings to me since we all lived in the same block back in our home country. \n\nMy parents invited him over for dinner and I drove him to my new apartment after dinner to show him my new place and hangout with two other cousins. My bf has met my other cousins but not him so he asked if he could join us and hangout and I said for sure.\n\n Akash and I were just catching up while everyone was on their way. During the conversation a lot of our childhood stories came up and I got sentimental. We were also bonding over some of the childhood trauma we experienced and how it affected us. I started sobbing as I was telling him how much I missed our group and I'm so happy we are all gonna be together after a long time. He consoled me and patted my head saying how proud he is of me that his little sister is now such a responsible grownup and stuff. My bf walked into the living room at that moment and saw me leaning my head on his shoulder and crying. He blurted out \"ayo what in the alabama shit is going on\" and started laughing hysterically. \n\nMy face turned red in embarrassment and I could barely mumble \"what\". Akash stood up and firmly said \"excuse me? do we have a problem here?\" and asked me if this is my bf. Then I asked bf what's wrong with you? who starts a conversation like that? He got even more defensive and said \"dont desi people marry their cousins all the time? It's funny bc it's true.\" \n\nWell I didn't find it funny and was enraging with embarrassment so I asked him to leave immediately before others get here. He tried to argue and say hi to Akash but I didn't leave any space for explanation and held the door open until he got out. I turned my phone off when he started blasting my phone with texts demanding to speak. My other cousins arrived shortly and we all had a great time catching up. When I woke up in the morning and turned my phone on I saw tons of missed calls and texts from my bf. He even posted some passive aggressive stuff on social media without mentioning my name. \n\nHe said how I overreacted to a very simple joke and turned him into the bad guy and I said if your first thought is to make such a cheap disgusting joke in front of someone who you literally saw for the first time then you really need to work on your humor and hung up. I'm still very upset and embarrassed and asked Akash to not tell anyone about it yet.

You implied my cousin and I were in an incestual relationship and that is something normal for my ethnicity. Let\u2019s see if your Facebook friends can see what\u2019s so funny about that\u201d", "NTA. Jokes are supposed to be funny. That was not", "NTA. Ex bf I hope", "NTA \n\nConsidering he made the Alabama \"joke\", then doubled down with the Desi \"joke\", I'm going out on a limb to say it's not a joke.", "NTA\n\nYour ex sounds terrible.", "NTA.   \n\n\nFellow South Asian here and I would be pissed if my boyfriend made a 'joke' like that. Talk about showing where HIS mind is if that was his first thought.", "You're right, and the relationship with your bf isn't long enough to have to deal with all that. NTA", "NTA\n\nBeing South Asian doesn't exclude people from being hateful to other South Asian groups. Anyone who knows some history knows that East Asian countries don't all get along, either, nor do all European countries, or the Americas.\n\nInbreeding allegations upon first meeting someone and then trying to convince you that you were overreacting and being passive-aggressive is not healthy in a relationship, OP.", "Classic ESH. Y\u2019all need to lighten up. And honestly the only reason to embarrassed over the initial joke is if there\u2019s a hint of truth to it", "This will be unpopular I guess but kinda YTA. It was a stupid insensitive joke but you over reacted. He\u2019s still obviously immature and toxic so I hope he\u2019s an ex soon enough. But yes, kicking him out for that joke was a little much. I do not support the joke, it was tasteless, but I think your response to it was disproportionate to the crime and fueled a fire unnecessarily. That being said, good thing you fueled it or you wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to see his disproportionate response to that, confirming beyond a doubt that he\u2019s an a-hole for other reasons. But he\u2019s an a-hole for his response, he\u2019s just insensitive for the bad joke.", "Consanguineous relationships are not incest (and referring to them as such is offensive to people from non-Western cultures where it\u2019s acceptable) but otherwise I agree.", "The joke was tasteless. People with class don't make jokes like that around people they've just met. \n\nThe racism was unforgivable.", "I have and am and don't disagree either. \n\n\"Don't date racists\" and \"dump your racist boyfriend\" aren't crazy suggestions to me.\n\nWhy are they to you?", " ayo what in the alabama apologist shit", "Sounds like they may have even put a ring on it", "Most of the world - and most of the US - permits first cousin marriage.", "Contrary to Reddit idioms, we don\u2019t fuck our cousins down here in Alabama. \n\nThe human you\u2019re replying to does have some strong incest vibes but Alabama has nothing to do with it.", "What's the nuance of his racism that only you seem to understand?\n\nIs it that you share those views?", "Moral or not, 1st cousin incest genetically impacts the child.", "This just in, the definition says incest is a legal term. And since OP is in the US this is what we got. Maybe click on the links and read before posting your lukewarm takes there bud.", "But we're talking about the US, where we do have a legal definition and this meets it.", "My dude take the L, this isn't a good look for you.", "Never say that in front of Americans, it breaks their brains.", "This is the question I'd like answered too. The only people that agree with people are racists themselves, so either this guy is a closeted racist or he's an open racist, and I'm kind of leaning to him being an open one, myself.", "Very little, unless it is repeated many times.", "In 24 out of 50 states."]}
