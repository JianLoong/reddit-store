I am not a cat person, and I was very apprehensive about this whole thing. Before I agreed to let them in the house, I laid out specific ground rules. I was very direct, and even put it in writing in a text so we could refer back to it. My stipulations included that I would not, in any way, lift a finger to help take care of the cats.\n\nNow, that might sound a bit harsh, but I do not want cats. I have a full plate at work. I do a lot helping out with my young kids and taking care of the house. On top of that, I've been the one primarily taking care of my dog for the last 14 years. I love that dog, but she needs a lot of care in her senior years. All of this together, I'm just tired. Adding one more thing to my plate just isn't healthy.\n\nToday I was sitting down watching TV and I noticed the cat peed right next to me. My wife had a girlfriend over and they were in the other room chatting. I asked her to come into the room and there I showed her the cat pee and asked her to clean it up. She was furious that I interrupted her and didn't just do it myself.\n\nI know it wouldn't have been a big deal for me to just clean it up this one time, but I was clear about the expectations and I didn't want this one time to turn into a normal thing.\n\nSo internet strangers, AITA for making my wife clean it up?\n\nEdit: I love the discussion here, even the shade. To clarify the piece most of you latched onto, I don't \"babysit\" my kids. I was merely trying to point out that I'm an active participant in the household. Unfortunately, many of my gender still think it's ok to provide financially and do nothing else, which is BS. While my wife doesn't work, we still split chores and are actively involved in our kids lives.\n\nAt the behest of many of you, I'm going to begin caring for the cats when situations like these arise. In hindsight, it seems petty not to and if nothing else, I'll do it because I love my wife. I'll still expect her to take primary care for them but I can do minor things like this when it's inconvenient for her to do so.\n\nCheers", "created_utc": 1691199381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15iidvm/aita_for_making_my_wife_clean_up_cat_pee_while/", "score": 939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because being in a marriage is about doing things for the other person and because they are the right thing to do even when you would rather not.   \nYour wife didn't' go adopt these kittens behind your back, they came in to your yard and needed help.  Your wife did the right thing in stepping up and helping them.  Most shelters right now are overrun with kittens and ones that are sick or injured (eye problems) have a bigger chance of being put down to make room for kittens that don't have problems.  Taking in these kittens is a wonderful act that your wife did,  they saved two lives and are something that she wants and loves.  You should want to help her out because she loves them and you love her.  I bet she helps you out all the time even when it is inconvenient for her because she loves you but your seem to be stuck in this idea that since you didn't want the cats you should never have to do anything for them and that their existence is just another thing for you to hold against her.  \nIf you keep acting like this and being a sh\\*t and making rules for her just because she dared to do something you didn't' want what is going to happen is your wife will probably stay in the marriage \"for the sake of the kids\" until they are done in school (this is if your lucky).  Once they leave the house she is going to think back on how you ruined anything she loved or that made her happy with your poor attitude and she is going to realize that instead of feeling the love she once felt for you she will feel nothing.  All she is going to remember is the constant bitching and the lack of support and one day she will wonder why she stayed in this relationship as long as she did and it will be to late and she will be gone.   \nA marriage is about working together, supporting each others and their wants and needs, when these kittens came in to your lives you had a choice at the beginning.  Keep them or help them find a good home.  You said she could keep them so quit punishing her for doing so.  That is all your doing with the nasty attitude.
