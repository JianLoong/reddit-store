Adding one more thing to my plate just isn't healthy.\n\nToday I was sitting down watching TV and I noticed the cat peed right next to me. My wife had a girlfriend over and they were in the other room chatting. I asked her to come into the room and there I showed her the cat pee and asked her to clean it up. She was furious that I interrupted her and didn't just do it myself.\n\nI know it wouldn't have been a big deal for me to just clean it up this one time, but I was clear about the expectations and I didn't want this one time to turn into a normal thing.\n\nSo internet strangers, AITA for making my wife clean it up?", "created_utc": 1691199381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15iidvm/aita_for_making_my_wife_clean_up_cat_pee_while/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would hope that he immediately threw some paper towels (or something) on it (OP is an idiot and an AH if he didn't), but that stain will not come out if you don't use the right products in the right way, and that will lead to the cats peeing on the sofa endlessly. If the cats pee on the floor and they don't use products that destroy the urine, it'll get into the floorboards and they'll never be able to have a cat in that house without it peeing on that spot; at least you can get a new couch.\n\nI'm a little worried that the wife also thought that this was something you could just blot up and call it good. Their house is going to be a disaster if they don't read up on how to deal with this stuff -- as well as behavior, as kittens require more attention and probably should have been in with her and her friend in the first place.

It sounds like they *did* have a discussion upon finding the stray cats, enough so that OP drew up a written agreement. Cats also pee on things when they are young.
