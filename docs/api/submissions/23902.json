I\u2019m sure she does a lot of shit for you that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t want to do, but she gets on with it because you\u2019re supposed to be partners.\n\nShe can does the bulk of the cat maintenance, but it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to take 30 seconds to help her.", "YTA\n\nbecause you're a family. As a one off help out. Otherwise your not going to have any fun or sex.", "ESH. Her for taking in a cat without a household agreement, and you for pulling that in front of her friend. No matter the circumstances, if I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house and her husband calls her into the room and tells her to clean their pet\u2019s mess, I\u2019m assuming her husband is at best, misogynistic, and as worst, abusive. You just secured the fact that her friend will never ever like you and will always be on high alert, and humiliated your wife.", "YTA", "He \u201chelps\u201d raise his kids. Nuff said.", "Just let the pee marinate next time", "Cat pee is the #1 reason I will never own cats. The other thing is you made a deal. If she agreed to the deal, she had to honor it. NTA.", "INFO: You say you\u2019re the \u201cprimary\u201d caretaker of your dog. Does that mean that she refuses to lift. Finger to take care of it while you handle it 100%? If your dog had an accident while you were entertaining company, would she come and inform you it\u2019s your responsibility to take care of it?", "Yet his dog - only \u201cprimarily\u201d his responsibility?", "This dynamic is honestly shitty though.  At the end of the day, you agreed to take the cats in.  Acting this way as a grown up in a marriage is a sure fire way to chip away at your partners love and respect for you.  Your marriage isn\u2019t built on stipulations spelled out via text messages.  It\u2019s enjoying a life together.  Be petty all you want but don\u2019t be surprised if it comes back at you in the form of resentment from your partner.", "But he did say no right?", "Some people won't take no for an answer when you veto having a pet. \"I need it, look how cute they are\" etc. My hunch is that those kittens would have stayed either way. OP vetoing would have led to him being called hearthless or worse. Only viable compromise is no responsibility.", "I'm sick to the teeth of dudes doing the bare minimum! What the hell, why are they STILL so lazy?", "For you to interrupt your wife and her friend while your wife's friend is visiting and say that is unbelievable. So, so embarrassing for your wife. Her friend will be gobsmacked and will probably be giving your wife some advice in regards to her future.", "What should they say when talking about watching the kid/s?", "What happened to him ?", "Why is this downvoted? It\u2019s true. You have to thoroughly clean cat pee or that spot stinks and becomes their toilet", "No it's not. He let her have what she wants even though he wants no part in it.", "You are totally assuming someone\u2019s intentions. He stated his intentions\u2026\u201dI was clear about the expectations and didn\u2019t want this one time to turn into a normal thing\u201d\u2026sounds like he was setting boundaries based on his clear communication of the expectations if she chose to get the kittens even though he didn\u2019t agree with the decision.", "It's called being a PARENT or a FATHER.   The Mother  never gets to watch or babysit , she is just simply assumed to be the Mother. \n\nSorry...   flashback to my ex  who told me that the weekend was his time off as he worked from 8 to 4 and he didn't think he had to do anything.  .  What the f did he think I did?", "He was stillborn with a bad nasal infection. Weirdly enough he came to life when we went to bury him 4 hours later. And just 2 weeks ago the infection caught up to him and he died another 3 times before his body couldn\u2019t take anymore\u2026so yeah I lost my buddy", "The one time my girl ever peed on the floor was out of fear.  She saw a strange cat up close and let out a wail and peed right where she stood.\n\nWas alot more careful to prevent a repeat", "I mean\u2026If that\u2019s the kind of energy you want to bring into a relationship,  then there\u2019s definitely plenty of it out there, it\u2019s not exactly unacceptable, you do you. \n\nBut for me-this is just like\u2026how can I say, I feel secondhand embarrassment reading this. Like a man, sees cat piss on his floor, perfectly capable of cleaning it, and calls his wife to clean it because he didn\u2019t want the cat. I\u2019m 33- that\u2019s like college roommate shit at best,  why bring that energy to a marriage?", "Yeah but if you do you have to call it something. You don't say no. I can't go to the ball game because I have to parent. People don't talk like that.", "Oh so sad. You gave him a good life", "On this note, it's possible they found OP to be a safe space and someone to guard them while they're vulnerable and just peed next to him.", "Because he did not agree to clean up or take care of the cat.  My wife has plans that I do not touch because I don't know how to take care of them.  If she did not want to take care of the cat then she should not have adopted it. Not everything in a marriage has to be split 50/50.", "Well don't explain.  I have my child, can't come. Simples.", "Yeah I tried\u2026we just received his ashes and it reopened the wound", "Yeah or don't get butt hurt about simple words.", "I've seen this so many times here and 9/10 times its when a husband is twisted to be an AH but the obvious AH wife is ignored.", "Exactly."]}
