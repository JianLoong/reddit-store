Think of counseling sessions as a really worthwhile investment in YOU, and BTW, you are absolutely worth it! If you have a good friend or loved one that you can count on to encourage you to take care of you, reach out to them and ask for their support.

This does not get better with time, it does not get better no matter how hard you try, it does not get better with therapy (people like your husband know how to manipulate that too).

Iirc, it includes something along the lines of \u2018the first time a woman is hit she is a victim. The second time, she is a volunteer.\u2019 I think that Becker has some really good points in the book, but although he\u2019s defended that line as trying to remind victims that they have agency, many survivors read it as victim blaming, and showing no sympathy for situations where someone *doesn\u2019t* have a lot of agency, like when they have small children to care for and are financially dependent on the abuser. \n\nI think there\u2019s still value in that book, but I always preface it with that warning when I hear people recommend it.", "I kinda feel like OP should be getting some advice on how to leave safely.

You're blinded by the fact that he's your first. That's a very tough issue, and people that have been divorced would see the obvious signs that you might not.\n\nFirst advice I'll give is to understand that anyone can marry anyone. It sounds stupid, but it's just true. Just because you've slept with someone and married them doesn't make them \"right\" for you. Look at your marriage from a 3rd party perspective. Are you treating eachother fairly? There's so many people in this world that you could be with. And you're not giving any reasons to stay.\n\nSecond advice is, that there's no second advice. Yeah that's all I got for ya."]}
