I hope 2024 is full of joy for you!", "You don't \n\nThere is always collateral damage when you've been with some that long, especially if you have kids \n\nThere are steps you can take to minimize the collateral \n\nBut op even mentioned in her original post she suggested divorce to her husband and he refused \n\nWhich is absurd to me\n\nYou can't just, say no, when someone says they want a divorce \n\nBut anyway;   was in an abusive relationship for 11.5 years myself \n\nIt took me a long time to put the pieces of my shattered life, what I had hoped for, dreamed my future would be like\n \nBack together\n\nAnd face the reality that my ex was not a part of my reality anymore \n\nIt's been 2 years \n\nI'm currently engaged;  and I can say I'm in a better place now, though the journey to get here hasn't been easy \n\nThat's why divorce is always the answer in abusive situations\n\nEspecially when it hasn't gotten to the point where you are afraid to leave", "You learn about abuse, and you learn all about how and why abusers behave the way they do so you can recognize when it happens. \n\nYou make a olan, and you get a support system. This is especially needed if you are being financially controlled. \n\nYou get a counselor- not a couple\u2019s counselor, but one who can help you work through the damage you have suffered as a result of the abuse, and the underlying beliefs about yourself that you used to justify the abuse in your head.\n\nIf you have kids, you remind yourself that the abusive relationship is far worse for them than a divorce. \n\nAnd then you accept that things are going to change, and aim for it to be a positive change on balance.

But the thing is, what you're describing is abuse, even if he doesn't hit you, he's constantly either belittling you or making you feel guilty for not being able to put his belittling aside when he's acting loving.\n\nIt's terrifying and it's a huge change and it'll be a lot to deal with. But the thing I found when I left was that I'd gotten so used to the weight of being with him that I had no idea it was possible to feel as light and free as I did when the weight of him was gone. It was like there was color in the world again and I'd forgotten those colors existed. You can love someone and still realize they are bad for you and decide to show love to yourself and get free. You deserve to have color in your life again, and you deserve to feel safe in your own home", "You will feel so much better alone. I promise.
