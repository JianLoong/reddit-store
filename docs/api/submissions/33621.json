We've been together for 9 years. But he has this habit of making me feel useless every time he does something around the house.\r  \n\r  \nExample: when I clean and find his empty coffee mugs around the house, or his dirty socks on the floor, I just take them and say nothing, continuing my cleaning chore. Meanwhile, when he does that, it turns into an hour long discussion about how am I such a bad wife and how I am failing to do this \"female job\".\r  \n\r  \nNow, I want admit I can be a little messy, especially when I have a lot on my plate. This year I've been dealing with my scoliosis, and the treatment has left me exhausted (to the point where I would faint or throw up), and he has helped a lot. But then he goes around telling everyone how he does everything around the house and I do basically nothing (which is not true, he cooks, I take care of the laundry and folding, and we contracted help once a week to maintain the bathroom hygiene).\r  \n\r  \nApart that, I am also in a critical point in my career: they are giving me extra responsibility which will later turn into more money, but I have to go through this period successfully, doing my best.\r  \n\r  \nI also want to add that his attitude lasts for about 30-60 minutes, then he transforms into this loving husband that hugs me, and makes sure I am warm and well fed. In these moments I feel like the luckiest girl in the world to experience such a loving partner. But somehow this isn't lowering the anxiety or stress on my body. My body still hurts and I am still numb. And then the cycle starts again in a few days.\r  \n\r  \nHe works at home, I go to the office. When I come back, he has already done some of the stuff around the house, making me feel bad about it. I can try to wake up early and do the chores, but he doesn't want me to, because he can't stand the noise when he works (he starts work at 5 am).\r  \n\r  \nWhen I try to tell him that the way he is speaking about me, makes me feel so stressed and so numb he mutters \"you and your philosophy \" or \"oh don't start again, you can't handle criticism\".\r  \n\r  \nAlso if I am in the middle of doing chores and he want intimacy, or if I am tired and I have to pick between chores and intimacy, he always wants intimacy, but then I'll get his attitude the day after for not doing the chore.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I don't want this to come out wrong, he does help me, and I am grateful, but I feel numb, and so stressed, to the point that if I open the door of my house and I notice that he has wiped the floors, my heart starts racing, my limbs start hurting and start to dissociate because I know he will start telling me that \"that was my job, as the female of the house\"\n\r\r\n\nI also want to add that I have already told him that maybe it would be better for us to divorce, but he doesn't want to, he shouts: \"that's all you think about.
