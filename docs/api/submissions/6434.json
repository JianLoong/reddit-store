Yeah lying is bad but he didn\u2019t break the window ?", "YTA for giving your elder son a more severe punishment than the son who actually broke the window.", "You're not wrong for being upset your eldest lied and punishing him for doing so, but if you're trying to teach him a good moral compass \"you wouldn't have been punished if you hadn't lied\" isn't really the way to go. \n\nI also disagree with your punishment. Your kid who broke the window and lied about it (two offences) got a lesser punishment both in scope of restrictions and scope of time than the kid who just lied (one offence). Even with the age and maturity difference between the two, that makes little sense.\n\nYTA for those points.", "Look unpopular here but YTA\n\nClearly you\u2019ve given them a reason to be afraid of you and bond together by lying instead of coming out with the truth. You need to figure out why. In my experience it\u2019s a classic authoritarian parenting style where the punishments regularly do not fit the crime and even if it\u2019s a genuine mistake you still get punished for an accident that was completely out if your control. \n\nYou will likely just end up damaging your relationship long term with them if you don\u2019t start listening. Have a conversation (3day grounding seems totally fair, 5 days for the older one seems petty) ask them Why they felt they couldn\u2019t be honest with you and genuinely listen. Don\u2019t respond, take some time to think about what they said and reflect in your behavior. Then wait a day or two or after the grounding is over and talk to them about why you reacted the way you did. \n\nWhy is lying so bad?\nWhy do YOU not like being lied to?\nIs it because you were lied to a-lot? Is it because you feel disrespected? Is it because you want to be able to have an honest relationship with them? \n\nTake some time to answer these questions yourself and then open up the discussion. Express how the situation made you feel AFTER you\u2019ve talked to them about why they felt they needed to lie to you. \n\nLeaving a day or two between these conversations is important because you want to give yourself time to reflect and HEAR them and potentially approach it differently in the future AND you don\u2019t want them to think you had this conversation just to make it about yourself while bot actually listening to them. Alternatively you could open with how you feel and then ask them how they feel about it and why they felt like they needed to lie. The main thing is to not ask them how they feel and then follow it up with how you feel. It will just sound like you don\u2019t actually care how they feel and you will be too focused on yourself to listen either.", "YTA obviously lies have consequences but I feel like this should have been dealt with fairly by giving them the same punishment.you stand to build resentment between them by treating them differently over this.", "Yta - one kid actually broke the window and got a lighter sentence? They're both old enough to understand lying isn't acceptable.", "ESH. \n\nThe kids shouldn\u2019t be lying, but it was an accident.

The one who actually broke a window?", "Soft YTA because you have created a home where your children do not feel safe telling you the truth or admitting mistakes. Improve your own behavior so they will want to improve theirs. Get Ross Greene's book Raising Human Beings and learn to collaborate with your children rather than controlling or punishing them.", "YTA. 16 & 10 is an age gap let them bond over things - equally in trouble together, or they get away w it together lol . If I were the 16 YO I\u2019d be resentful or unhelpful next time.", "NAH. Lying is wrong, but he was just looking out for his brother. I guess it kind of depends what the punishment would have been for the youngest if he had just owned up to making a mistake. If he was always going to be punished, then it makes sense that they would attempt to lie. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong for you to reprimand your child for lying to you; but I also don\u2019t think your older son was in the wrong for trying to shield his brother from the consequences of a small mistake.", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe all of the N T As. Why they were afraid to tell you about something that was an accident? And why did you give them different punishments?", "NTA for punishing them for the lie. YTA for giving them different punishments for the same thing.", "YTA \n\nNot for punishing them, but for how you\u2019ve gone about it. I think it says a lot about their relationship that your 16 year old would try to protect his kid brother like that. That is a large age gap, and your son Carter is only a couple years away from legally being a man. I would argue that the years for teaching your oldest son not lie are over - he knows not to lie, and it sounds like he tried not to in this situation. Could he perhaps have claimed ignorance as a way to avoid lying to you while also providing his little brother with the opportunity to tell or not tell the truth himself? \nA punishment for lying, sure. But I definitely don\u2019t think the eldest deserved a worse punishment. Personally I think that he could benefit a lot more from a good conversation with you, and seeing you exercise love and understanding towards them. Because my next question would be the same as others here have said, why didn\u2019t either of your sons feel they could come to you about this? Maybe you\u2019ve been too harsh in the past. Maybe your 10 year old has anxiety and doesn\u2019t know how to express that. Obviously I don\u2019t know your life, your kids, or how you parent. But I think digging into the \u201cWhy\u201d of their lies, with a mind that\u2019s open to fault and full of compassion for your kids, could be good for you all. Punishing them won\u2019t build trust (both ways!), and that\u2019s what you are needing here.", "YTA. Punishing the younger one is fine. The older one doesn\u2019t deserve a punishment. You should be looking at why both were afraid to tell you the truth initially.", "YTA. \n\nWhy would you give your older son a bigger punishment?? He didn't break the window!\n\nYou also need to think about why your older son lied to you in the first place.", "NTA, but I would\u2019ve grounded them both for the same amount of time, not 3 days for one and 5 for the other. Pretty cool the teenager didn\u2019t want to be a snitch, tho.", "You're both TA him for lying and you for grounding your oldest for more time than the younger. They both lied, and the younger broke the window. Now, obviously, the older one should set an example, but a 10 year old is old enough to know better.", "NTA - neither should have lied. \n\nBut - I don\u2019t know about the whole he should have told me discreetly comment. I don\u2019t have kids - but my mom belongs in the raised by narcissists sub, and she LOVES to play my sisters and I off each other - this kinds *feels* a little bit like that to me. \n\nEither way - kids shouldn\u2019t have lied, maybe same punishment for both?", "NAH\n\nLying is obviously wrong.\n\nbut at the same time, I kinda get that Carter had a big brother instinct to not be a snitch and look out for his brother. \n\nand Tristan is a 9 year old that likely hasn\u2019t fully grasped how to handle tough conversations like a grown up yet, so I get why he didn\u2019t come clean either. A lot of kids get scared when they have something to say that they know the parents don\u2019t want to hear. Take the next five days to cool down and have a conversation with Tristan about it after both kids are off punishment.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nCovering for a \"crime\" makes you complicit.

Kids learn to hide things from their parents for a reason - often, wild over-reactions over minor things.", "NTA. He was babysitting which made it his responsibility to tell you. I'm an older sibling who has babysat constantly for the younger ones, stuff like this is the type of thing you not only tell the parents, but you call instantly about.

You are grounding the older one for way longer while the offender gets away with less. \n\nThe older one will come to resent you and his younger brother. Which can and will cause problems. For example he will start ignoring you, start lying to you even more if he isn't already. Will get to the point where once he turns 18 years old he will be gone.

He was only punished for lying too, not for breaking the window. \n\nIt seems likely they were probably playing catch or something, but who knows. But definitely stupid that op is punishing the 26 year old more than the one who broke the window.", "I read the other comments and felt like I was in the fucking twilight zone. Children lie, especially when they think they're going to be in trouble. This is not a normal, usual type of misbehaving, they broke a *window.* Of course they're going to lie. \n\nThe punishment (only a few days!) is more than reasonable considering the crime. There's not a lot of parents who would only punish a child for three days for such a serious offense. She's also making it clear that honesty is as important to her as treating her house with respect -- an important lesson.\n\nETA: And it makes sense to punish the older one more. He should have known better. If he was 12 I might agree that it was unfair, but 16? He was the babysitter. His entire job is to honestly report back to their mother. Hell, he should have called her when it happened. Teenagers know better than to lie.", "Yup the one who not only lied but also broke the window, probably doing something he knew not to and got a lesser punishment.", "Did you grow up with any siblings?"]}
