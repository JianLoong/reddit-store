My grandparents, his parents, were always in my life though and were always good to me. Mom married her husband when I was 2 and she has my half siblings who are now 17, 15 and 12. My mom made it mandatory for my grandparents to include my half siblings if they wanted to be in my life, so they did, though not to the same level. I graduated high school two years ago and my grandparents spent money for me and two friends to go on a trip and they also bought me a really nice PC as graduation gifts. My grandpa died last year. Now it's just grandma and my half sister (17) is graduating high school in May and there is a big deal being made that my grandma has not asked her about gifts or anything like she and grandpa did for me when I was in my senior year. My grandma said she did that for me because I was her grandson but she was never planning to give anything for mom's other kids. She told mom that her and grandpa even saved money for me to give as a wedding gift in the future. Mom told her that we wouldn't stand for it and those kids see her as their grandma and after she let her and my grandpa stay in my life, the least she could do is treat all her children the same and give them the same. When mom told me I told her I was not mad and I always knew my grandparents only included my half siblings so they could see me. My half sister then jumps in saying it's not fair and blood shouldn't make me more their grandkid and mom agreed with her. I told them my grandma doesn't owe my half sister or any of my half siblings gifts and that my relationship won't change with grandma over this. They told me I was an asshole and that I should be siding with my family, with my siblings, over a grandparent from a deadbeat.\n\nGrandma and I have talked and we're good. I don't even live with my mom anymore so I try to just ignore the anger but they definitely take it as me being a dick to my half siblings and took offense at what I said so I wanna know AITA?", "created_utc": 1670421117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf1mpb/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_my_half_sister_that/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is delusional and should be ashamed she forced her kids on your grandparents.  I\u2019m guessing that now that you\u2019re an adult your grandmother realizes she doesn\u2019t need to listen your mother anymore.  Good for her!", "NTA. Your mom extorted your grandparents long enough and after being plainly greedy about it into your adulthood, she's in Find Out season. There is no reason your mom should have forced your dad's parents to pay-to-play as your grandparents. Her forcing them into this position created tension where none should exist. She shouldn't have been fucking around with people who lost a child and just wanted to love his son.", "NTA.. But your mother certainly is. Wow.\n\nYour mom: Threatens grandparents with seeing you only if they treat her other kids as grandkids... Wants to deligate who what your grandparents can do with their own money... When not getting her way, she reminds your grandparents that she allowed them to stay in your life.\n\nYour mother is one self centered.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom spent 17 years blackmailing her former in-laws, and now that you can see them on your own, the well is drying up.   Too bad, so sad.\n\nAs far as  your siblings go, if you want to stay on good terms with them, the best you can probably do is to simply take the position that your grandparents are adults who make their own decisions, and if they choose to prioritize their biological grandchild, that's their right.    If they can't accept that, you might have to go LC, at least until they grow up enough to realize that the world doesn't actually work the way their mom tried to make it work.", "NTA - your grandparents sound like amazing grandparents that they included children who had zero relation to them to keep you in their life. They absolutely do not owe your half siblings any gifts and you're right for standing up for them now that you (presumably) are an adult old enough to", "NTA - your grandmother is your family, too. \n\nMaybe if your mother hadn't extorted a relationship from them your grandmother would have a different attitude.", ">My half sister then jumps in saying it's not fair and blood shouldn't make me more their grandkid\n\nUhhhhhhhh.....actually in this case it does.........\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mom really did a disservice to your half-siblings. Instead of simply explaining to them that you have different grandparents and that's ok, she set them up to believe there was a sincere emotional connection with your grandparents, when in fact they were being blackmailed into including them. It would be genuinely pretty crushing to discover someone I thought loved me as a child was only including me because my parent forced the issue.  \n\n\nThat however, does not make you the AH (or your grandparents for that matter). Your mom clearly is the one at fault here. I'd just encourage you to keep in mind how incredibly shitty this is for your half-siblings.", "NTA so what if they are your half siblings you nor your grandparents are responsible for them. Did your mother give you a graduation gift? Doesn't sound like that. Why can't your mother give her a graduation gift? Your mother is controlling and she also sounds like a narcissist.", "NTA-  Your mother on the other hand is the AH.  Giving her late husbands parents an ultimatum to be in your life.  It was your mother/step father that put you and your siblings in this situation.  Your siblings have zero to do with this. Don't be upset with your siblings.  With that said, now that your older and not being controlled by your mother/step father, your grandmother is free from this ultimatum.", "NTA, your mom is the AH", "NTA.  It is time both you and gran  went low contact or no contact with your mum and family.  It was a forced friendship,  your gran did it  due to love for you, not them  and you could ask  your sibling how they would feel if some forced friendship on them.", "NTA: Your mom is a huge A hole. She is emotionally manipulative and blackballed your grandparents. Your grandma doesn't owe your siblings a damn thing. Neither of your grandparents ever owed your mother or your siblings anything. Your Grandma is also probably on a limited and fixed income especially with the death of her partner. Your mom is extremely inconsiderate and needs to wake up to reality.", "NTA and I\u2019m curious to know if she forced her husbands parents to treat you the same as your half-siblings.", "NTA they called your dead dad a deadbeat? Why are you even talking to them at this point?", "NTA. Your grandma owes them nothing", "NTA\n\nYour grandmother abided by your mother's rules in order to continue her relationship with you.\n\nIt is sad for your half siblings who were just innocent pawns in this game and may have come to think Grandma as a family member if she cut them off emotionally.  But if they are only worried about the money, then I dont feel bad for them.", "NTA - your mom extorted those gifts from your GP.  I'd be tempted to cut her off until she has repaid the full value plus interest.  Her behavior was despicable.", "Nta and does your half siblings family also give you gifts?", "NTA- Its astounding to me the amount of people that I see on here that do this. You can't force a relationship between people when there isn't one. Your mother is the asshole here as she forced a relationship when there wasn't one. She literally used seeing you as leverage to get your grandparents to also take the other kids. She no longer has the leverage as you are now old enough to see them on your own. She should have seen this coming. She literally has no one to be mad at but herself. Had she not forced the relationship the kid's would not see your grandmother as being theirs. She made her bed now she has to lay in.", "Did stepdads parents treat you like their grandchild. We\u2019re they made to include you in everything if they wanted to see their grandchildren. Does your mother treat all of you equally or is she one of those mothers who babies her kids with her husband but is mean to her child with ex.", "The giving of gifts is an act of generosity.   The giver decides who to receive a gift.  No one ever deserves a gift because someone else got a gift.   Fairness is not an element of gift giving.   Grandma can and should give gifts to the people she wants to receive gifts and only them.   She should not be influenced by the misguided demands of others.   Other's opinions are irrelevant.", "NTA. If blood doesn't make a grandchild, can I have a present as well?", "NTA.\n\nYour mom doesn't get to dictate what your Grandma does with her own money. And while I get your Mom wanting to provide for all HER kids, your half siblings are NOT your Grandma's relations.\n\nIt's extremely entitled and rude for them to demand anything.", "NTA your mom is however. Your grandparents owe your half-siblings nothing.", "NTA your mother is being ridiculous- I'm the grandmother to 2 little girls, my son has remarried and his new in-laws are kind to them but do not participate in gift giving, etc..and I don't expect them to. They are not their relatives and really have no connection to them.Your mother is way out out of bounds and had no right to blackmail your grandparents, don't your half siblings have their own grandparents?", "NTA \n\nYour mom is living in LaLa land that she didn't see this coming years ago. Your grandparents only did things for her other kids because she blackmailed them with access to you. This was unfair to everyone, including the younger kids who are just now facing the reality of the lack of emotions for them from your grandma.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mum has been an A H for years man.", "[removed]", "But did OP say his siblings were emotionally connected? Or was it like Santa Claus to his siblings? They're into the gifts but when they end, no hard feelings, because they move on. It sounds like there was always a difference in the relationship and his grandparents performed transactionally but not actually bonding. Sorry the Gift ATM stopped, there isn't any way to force Grammy to give siblings gifts when Mommy doesn't control her now independent adult son's relationships.", "Mom gave me a gift. It just wasn't like what my grandparents gave me. She knows she won't be able to match it with my half siblings either which I think makes her want to push this more with my grandma.", "I was wondering that myself, where are they now so they can spoil their grandchild.  Besides OP is a living piece if their deceased son, they should never had to negotiate for access to him.

This is 100% on mom", "I think with kids it's hard to detangle the affection from the self-interested stuff. (And 17 is still a kid - while you might intellectually understand stuff like an adult emotionally you still have some maturing to do.)  \n\n\nMy 4 year old has grandparents who dote on him. If you ask him about his grandma it'll be something like \"I love my grandma because she gives me hugs and cookies\". I *know* there is a genuine connection there. I also am certain he loves the constant sugar at Grandma's house. It's all tied together in his head.  \n\n\nUnless OP has reason to believe that there genuinely is no emotional connection, it costs him absolutely nothing to feel sympathy for his half-siblings and place the blame solely where it belongs: with his adult mother who should have known better.", "Even so it's really not your grandma's responsibility. Your grandparents probably discussed it a long time ago and made the decision to not give the others a gift. It is their money and they can spend it however they want.", "Yeah and it seems your sister qas watching and waiting for  her turn because she feels entitled to the same.  What about her father's family, are they coughing up big time for her? Did they do anything for you? Either way this is all on your mother, nothing you should feel guilty about.", "None of these kids are 4 years old. They're 12 or older. They know the difference between their big brother's relationship with his grandparents and theirs and they've known for a while.", "Just wait until OP has anything left to him in Grammy's will... that'll be another drama. Its good that its being hashed out now because Mommy is pretty entitled and greedy so best for her to learn that since she extorted her former inlaws, rather than making them treasured parts of her expanded family, there is no real bond with her new family. This goes one of two ways when someone loses a spouse with whom they had children: either the deceased spouse's parents have to fight to remain in their grandkid(s)' lives or they never have to question their place  with their grandchild(ren). OP's mom took the fight route. She could have been open and welcome them and the bonds of the half siblings could form naturally but she decided extortion was the answer. No real way to bond when you know your relationship with your grandchild is at risk."]}
