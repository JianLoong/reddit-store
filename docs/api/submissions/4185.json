My mom made it mandatory for my grandparents to include my half siblings if they wanted to be in my life, so they did, though not to the same level. I graduated high school two years ago and my grandparents spent money for me and two friends to go on a trip and they also bought me a really nice PC as graduation gifts. My grandpa died last year. Now it's just grandma and my half sister (17) is graduating high school in May and there is a big deal being made that my grandma has not asked her about gifts or anything like she and grandpa did for me when I was in my senior year. My grandma said she did that for me because I was her grandson but she was never planning to give anything for mom's other kids. She told mom that her and grandpa even saved money for me to give as a wedding gift in the future. Mom told her that we wouldn't stand for it and those kids see her as their grandma and after she let her and my grandpa stay in my life, the least she could do is treat all her children the same and give them the same. When mom told me I told her I was not mad and I always knew my grandparents only included my half siblings so they could see me. My half sister then jumps in saying it's not fair and blood shouldn't make me more their grandkid and mom agreed with her. I told them my grandma doesn't owe my half sister or any of my half siblings gifts and that my relationship won't change with grandma over this. They told me I was an asshole and that I should be siding with my family, with my siblings, over a grandparent from a deadbeat.\n\nGrandma and I have talked and we're good.

Your mom extorted your grandparents long enough and after being plainly greedy about it into your adulthood, she's in Find Out season.

Too bad, so sad.\n\nAs far as  your siblings go, if you want to stay on good terms with them, the best you can probably do is to simply take the position that your grandparents are adults who make their own decisions, and if they choose to prioritize their biological grandchild, that's their right.    If they can't accept that, you might have to go LC, at least until they grow up enough to realize that the world doesn't actually work the way their mom tried to make it work.", "NTA - your grandparents sound like amazing grandparents that they included children who had zero relation to them to keep you in their life. They absolutely do not owe your half siblings any gifts and you're right for standing up for them now that you (presumably) are an adult old enough to", "NTA - your grandmother is your family, too. \n\nMaybe if your mother hadn't extorted a relationship from them your grandmother would have a different attitude.", ">My half sister then jumps in saying it's not fair and blood shouldn't make me more their grandkid\n\nUhhhhhhhh.....actually in this case it does.........\n\nNTA", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mom really did a disservice to your half-siblings. Instead of simply explaining to them that you have different grandparents and that's ok, she set them up to believe there was a sincere emotional connection with your grandparents, when in fact they were being blackmailed into including them. It would be genuinely pretty crushing to discover someone I thought loved me as a child was only including me because my parent forced the issue.  \n\n\nThat however, does not make you the AH (or your grandparents for that matter). Your mom clearly is the one at fault here. I'd just encourage you to keep in mind how incredibly shitty this is for your half-siblings.", "NTA so what if they are your half siblings you nor your grandparents are responsible for them. Did your mother give you a graduation gift? Doesn't sound like that. Why can't your mother give her a graduation gift? Your mother is controlling and she also sounds like a narcissist.", "NTA-  Your mother on the other hand is the AH.  Giving her late husbands parents an ultimatum to be in your life.  It was your mother/step father that put you and your siblings in this situation.  Your siblings have zero to do with this. Don't be upset with your siblings.  With that said, now that your older and not being controlled by your mother/step father, your grandmother is free from this ultimatum.", "NTA, your mom is the AH", "NTA.  It is time both you and gran  went low contact or no contact with your mum and family.  It was a forced friendship,  your gran did it  due to love for you, not them  and you could ask  your sibling how they would feel if some forced friendship on them.", "NTA: Your mom is a huge A hole. She is emotionally manipulative and blackballed your grandparents. Your grandma doesn't owe your siblings a damn thing. Neither of your grandparents ever owed your mother or your siblings anything. Your Grandma is also probably on a limited and fixed income especially with the death of her partner. Your mom is extremely inconsiderate and needs to wake up to reality.", "NTA and I\u2019m curious to know if she forced her husbands parents to treat you the same as your half-siblings.", "NTA they called your dead dad a deadbeat?

Her behavior was despicable.", "Nta and does your half siblings family also give you gifts?", "NTA- Its astounding to me the amount of people that I see on here that do this. You can't force a relationship between people when there isn't one. Your mother is the asshole here as she forced a relationship when there wasn't one. She literally used seeing you as leverage to get your grandparents to also take the other kids. She no longer has the leverage as you are now old enough to see them on your own. She should have seen this coming. She literally has no one to be mad at but herself. Had she not forced the relationship the kid's would not see your grandmother as being theirs. She made her bed now she has to lay in.", "Did stepdads parents treat you like their grandchild. We\u2019re they made to include you in everything if they wanted to see their grandchildren.

The giver decides who to receive a gift.  No one ever deserves a gift because someone else got a gift.   Fairness is not an element of gift giving.

Its good that its being hashed out now because Mommy is pretty entitled and greedy so best for her to learn that since she extorted her former inlaws, rather than making them treasured parts of her expanded family, there is no real bond with her new family. This goes one of two ways when someone loses a spouse with whom they had children: either the deceased spouse's parents have to fight to remain in their grandkid(s)' lives or they never have to question their place  with their grandchild(ren). OP's mom took the fight route. She could have been open and welcome them and the bonds of the half siblings could form naturally but she decided extortion was the answer.

I would expect your grandma to attend the party and bring a card and small gift if she is able to, but it should definitely not be the same level as your gift.  Did your half siblings' grandparents get you anything for graduation and if they did was it the same caliber gift that their actual grandkids will receive?
