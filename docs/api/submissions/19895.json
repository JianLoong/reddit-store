Demanding to know why you were nude in \"your\" own home. Good grief. Maybe their little peeping Tom should stay in his own yard.", "NTA.  Why was their son looking inside your house?", "Yeah son peeping through the windows is 100% more problematic than being nude in whatever context in your own home.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to explain yourself for being naked in your own house", "Omg \ud83d\ude02 WHY ARE YOU NAKED INSIDE YOUR OWN HOUSE?!?! This is just ridiculous. NTA. I\u2019m curious though- what did they say?? \ud83d\ude02", "NTA put aside the kid seeing you the parents had no buisness asking what you were doing. Maybe they could have told you to make sure to make it so people couldn't peek into the house. Other than that though they should've used this as a teaching moment for their kids as to why they shouldn't go snooping like that.", "NTA, your house your rules. They should tell their son to stay out of your yard.", "was this in a place he could obviously see you with a lot of windows or was is in a basement or a room with blinds closed?", "NAH.  He shouldn't really be able to see you naked in your house, and if the parents are concerned the son can see you then maybe you should look into how to prevent him seeing you.  It's pretty confronting but I don't think it's wrong for them to have a concern that their son can see you.\n\nYou can certainly do whatever in your own space but with consideration for you neighbors too, so you should listen to the concern.", "Uh, if you didn't have the blinds pulled so the kids couldn't see straight in then YTA.  I understand you are in your own house, but for heaven's sake, pull the blinds, or you might find some full frontal pics, taken by the kids, online somewhere.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ignore them. None of their business.", "NTA you have a future Peeping Tom on your hands", "NTA. Its your House and if you want to be naket all day in It, you can, and its not they dam business.", "NTA. You can be naked in your house - it is your house.", "NTA. What the hell? These people are creeps!", "If you were a guy there would be lots of YTA here. So in the interests of fairness, I'm going to say YTA because while you're fully within your rights to be naked in your house, you're not usually (depending on jurisdiction) within your rights to be naked where kids can see you. So the parents probably had that reasonable concern and you were not very empathetic to that.", "Wait, being nude with the intention of being seen is problematic (but OP has not said that they were doing this but wanted to clarify).", "I was on the second floor of my house. I also forgot to mention that they also have two story house but their second floor is way lower than mine", "I feel like if OP was a male and it was the neighbours young daughter that saw them, then more people would be saying YTA.", "Agree", "Second floor nudity should never be an issue- kid has to be trying to see it, they weren't just flying by...", "\u201cyou're fully within your rights to be naked in your house\u201d\n\nCut out everything else and you hit the nail on the head.
