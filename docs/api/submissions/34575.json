If not, why should it be different for you?

First off, she's wrong, if you were being a dick about pronouns, that would be transphobic, not homophobic, so she can't even get that right.\n\nSecond, while yes, they/them pronouns are gender neutral, and are okay to be used for the short period when you don't know someone's pronouns, the moment you know how one identifies and you continue using they/them pronouns, youre ignoring their gender identity and preferences, therefore being transphobic.\n\nThey/them is used by gender non-conforming people, and Amy is kind of causing them harm by insisting on using such pronouns on everyone instead of only those who prefer them. By doing so she is potentially invalidating their identity by using those pronouns for cis and trans people who identify as a specific gender.", "NTA!!! I have this same problem. I am LGBT myself but my pronouns are she/her and I have made this VERY clear to people and my school. I continue to get called they/them. I am not a traditionally feminine woman, I like masculine things. Though I have a very feminine face and haircut. It feels very insulting, like they aren't sure what I am simply because i'm not hyper feminine like they'd expect for a woman. they have gone so far left they circle back around and become downright sexist.
