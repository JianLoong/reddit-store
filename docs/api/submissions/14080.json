If he had special circumstances as to why he wanted a larger room he should have told you. He didn\u2019t mention anything so you were correct in refusing. Your master bath and bedroom are private and should remain that way.", "NTA.  Weird and creepy.  He probably wanted to rifle through your stuff (steal meds, scope out the bedroom) and so was annoyed at getting the guest bathroom with less access.", "NTA. I mean, I wouldn't want him coming into my bedroom, especially if you were getting an estimate for your kitchen. However, maybe he's claustrophobic?

This type of strange behavior will def lead to problems if hired.", "NTA\n\nI can only think of ~~2~~ 3 reasons for this\n\n1) He is claustraphobic.  This doesn't make sense to me though because the average bathroom stall is going to be larger than a half bath.  Hell, the average single cab pickup truck is going to feel smaller than a half bath.  And GC's tend to have to go into small enclosed spaces on the regular.  Closets, crawl spaces, attics etc etc\n\n2) He to use the master bathroom is because that is where people tend to keep their prescription medications\n\n3) u/returnof_datbooty made a good point.  A 3rd scenario could involve spy cameras.  Master bathrooms would have the most naked people traffic presumably.  So it makes sense to try and get in there if you are a perv\n\nMe personally?  I would assume #2 is the reason he wanted to use the master bathroom and would throw away his project estimate\n\nI feel like if he was claustraphobic, he would have said something.  Plenty of people have that phobia.  It's a simple explanation for the request.  And he specifically mentioned the master bathroom.  He didn't ask if there was a larger bathroom....like a regular sized guest bathroom or hall bathroom other than the master.\n\nHe wanted to go into the master...specifically\n\nAnd the fact he didn't attempt to explain the request AND used the \"I'm too big for the half bathroom\" even though you said he was a relatively thin person...again reinforces the idea that he was looking for drugs\n\nEDIT:  Adding a 3rd option because someone made a really good point in a comment", "Nta.

He could have asked himself \"Do I wanna be the guy who asked to use the main bath, or do I wanna be the guy who blew up the downstairs bathroom?\" and made a split-second decision. These are potential clients we're talking about and dropping a deuce at another person's house is still treated like a cardinal sin. \n\nThere's absolutely no harm in asking.
