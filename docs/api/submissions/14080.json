This doesn't make sense to me though because the average bathroom stall is going to be larger than a half bath.  Hell, the average single cab pickup truck is going to feel smaller than a half bath.  And GC's tend to have to go into small enclosed spaces on the regular.  Closets, crawl spaces, attics etc etc\n\n2) He to use the master bathroom is because that is where people tend to keep their prescription medications\n\n3) u/returnof_datbooty made a good point.  A 3rd scenario could involve spy cameras.  Master bathrooms would have the most naked people traffic presumably.  So it makes sense to try and get in there if you are a perv\n\nMe personally?  I would assume #2 is the reason he wanted to use the master bathroom and would throw away his project estimate\n\nI feel like if he was claustraphobic, he would have said something.  Plenty of people have that phobia.  It's a simple explanation for the request.  And he specifically mentioned the master bathroom.  He didn't ask if there was a larger bathroom....like a regular sized guest bathroom or hall bathroom other than the master.\n\nHe wanted to go into the master...specifically\n\nAnd the fact he didn't attempt to explain the request AND used the \"I'm too big for the half bathroom\" even though you said he was a relatively thin person...again reinforces the idea that he was looking for drugs\n\nEDIT:  Adding a 3rd option because someone made a really good point in a comment", "Nta.

It's very weird and I wouldn't let him use it either.\n\nGo with a different contractor though.", "He maybe had claustrophobia and wouldn\u2019t like being in such a small area with the door closed\n\nNAH, he could have explained his reasons", "Did he specifically ask for the bedroom or just ask for a larger bathroom?\nI would not expect the master bathroom to be attached to a bedroom so unless he specifically asked for the bedroom I would not consider him a creep.\nFor some reason he needed access to a tub or shower and was not comfortable sharing his reasons so he did not use the bathroom.\nNo harm no foul", "I'm going to guess that maybe he wanted access to a shower/tub for some reason, (Maybe he's used to using a bidet?) and not something nefarious like he wanted access to your personal belongings. \n\nIn any case, you're NTA. It's not mean to not want someone to use your master bathroom. If he reaaallly had to go, he would have used the half bathroom.", "NAH. I don't know why everyone is jumping straight to he's a creep or wanted to rob you. There are plenty of legitimate reasons why he could have wanted to use a different bathroom, not the least of which being claustrophobia, which is what my mind immediately jumped to. Either way, he asked, you said no, and he was fine with that. No issue.", "NTA.  That seems weird and suspicious.  I personally think the master bathroom in our house is private and we have guests always use our other bathroom.", "NTA at all, that is such a strange interaction that honestly I wouldn't employ him to do whatever work you wanted. Sounds like he's trying to size you up so he can see how much money he can squeeze out of the job.", "did anyone else get a hidden camera vibe? like he wanted to plant one? i have no idea if that's an easy thing to do but either way it's weeeeeird", "NAH \n\n\n\nThat interaction at a glance hints that he may have claustrophobia. You're not an AH to set boundaries and not want him in your personal space. He's not an AH for asking if there was another bathroom and when you said no choosing to hold it instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy close friend has claustrophobia. He is 5ft 3in and could be knocked over by a strong wind, but if you directed him to a closet sized bathroom, he would rather piss himself than step foot in it.", "Definitely NTA\n\nIck. This screams red flag. Especially since \"he could wait\" Guess he didn't really need to go.\n\nAnd why would your hubby think y t a? I think he is missing the fact that your safety could have been at risk.", "Super weird. NTA. Probably looking for meds.", "NTA, that strikes me as a pretty weird thing to do and while it doesn't necessarily mean that he had ill intent, I can think of more plausible reasons that involve something shady than plausible reasons with no harm intended. My guess would be that he wanted to look through your cabinets for prescription medication. Maybe he just wanted somewhere around less people but I think I would have said no either way.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he wanted to get in your medicine cabinet, go through your undergarment drawer, take jewelry or plant a camera. \n\nThere's not one legitimate reason for him to use your private bathroom and have access to your stuff.\n\nI have IBS. I don't buy the GI issue excuse people mention because when it's an emergency you're just grateful there's a toilet. You don't have time to worry about the size of the room or if the door even locks. It's happening right now. \n\nThe fact that he didn't even pretend to use the bathroom gives me weird vibes. Why not lie and be polite about it? Why ask if you don't really have to go? Why not take a break and find a more appropriate bathroom if you can't make that one work? Why not run home and come back?", "Maybe I\u2019m jaded but my mind immediately goes to \u201che wants to rifle through your medicine cabinet\u201d NTA.", "NTA. I hope you chose a different contractor.", "NTA sketchy", "Benefit of the doubt, he could be claustrophobic. But how does a contractor deal with portajohns?\n\nIt was weird. It\u2019s ok to think it\u2019s wierd. You don\u2019t have to hire him", "NTA. he's looking for meds, lingerie, or something pervy. If he had to really go, he'd use the bathroom offered. Weird af", "NTA I thought thievery immediately.", "NTA. Weird and creepy behavior. I think he wants to install a spy camera on you. Please do not hire this person. He should never be near your property again.", "This is so weird. If he REALLY had to go, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Dudes be peeing in alleyways  if they have to go bad enough. Shady af. NTA. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t hire him.", "NTA. This guy was looking for your prescriptions.", "NTA! A stranger wanting to go into your bedroom and your personal bathroom is super sketchy. He did not need access to your personal space, and the things you keep there.", "NTA. Huge red flag. He could\u2019ve wanted to snoop, steal, leave a hidden camera, leave a window open, so many things! Not worth the risk just to be nice. Your husband is naive.", "NTA. I am getting red flags, too. Maybe there was a legitimate reason, but going through your cabinets looking for opiates, etc comes to mind as a not legitimate reason.", "That is very weird.  NTA.", "your husband feels like you were rude because it's atypical to have to turn down a request like this. he is neglecting the fact that this is because people don't usually make requests like this lol. this was a super weird request to make. nta.", "Nobody is the AH. He asked, you refused, he moved on. Certainly a slightly awkward interaction, but it sounds like it was over in 10 seconds, so rather painless. Though, both of you would definitely be considered a little weird where I come from.", "NTA aren\u2019t master bathrooms also typically rather small since they\u2019re an ensuite? It could just be phrasing but the wording of \u201cmaster bathroom\u201d opposed to something like \u201clarger bathroom\u201d strikes me as odd\u2026. \nThough there are innocent reasons, most contractors I\u2019ve known try to avoid using customer\u2019s bathrooms in general unless it\u2019s an emergency.", "NTA\n\nI am claustrophobic and can't use the downstairs bathroom in my parents house. However, I don't ask for alternatives in stranger's homes. I either go (if I'm on my last leg) or I just pretend I went to not be rude.", "NTA you did the right thing by clocking how weird his request was. Why would a contractor insist on going into your bedroom, when there's a perfectly good bathroom downstairs?? Don't listen to your husband, he sounds a little na\u00efve.", "I think that's weird and suspicious. NTA", "Are y\u2019all slave owners?\n\nPrimary bath.\n\nNAH", "Along with that, I just don't like people being in my bedroom, even if it is to just walk through it to the bathroom.  That is my personal space.  Since moving in almost 15 years ago the only people who have entered my bedroom have been my parents who were helping take care of me after surgery, the friend that takes care of our cats when we travel and a handful of contractors who needed crawl space access (the opening is in the bedroom closet).  The trusted friend is the only one who has been there alone.  I would be creeped out if someone insisted on having private access to my space.", "Seriously. A friend had me use her master bath while their main bath was having work done, and it felt vaguely intrusive even though that was the one option and perfectly reasonable. Because of course we don\u2019t usually use other people\u2019s private master baths. \n\nA stranger saying \u201cI don\u2019t like that bathroom so offer me a better one\u201d is beyond weird. He was looking for Vicodin.", "Agreed. \n\nBut, bless this guy's heart.... Sounds like he had to take a surprise shit and was grasping at straws not to use the bathroom immediately next to his potential clients.", "I hope you didn\u2019t hire this guy. He\u2019s a creep. Check for hidden cameras", "Excellent point. However\u2026 in this day and age\u2026 \nWe have things like Poo-Pourri which works great at hiding smells and as for bathroom noises? Turn on the faucet full blast on and/or a white noise app on your phone\u2026\n\nI sold flooring home to home for awhile. That\u2019s what I did if #2 was needed. That way I didn\u2019t have to embarrass every one with my issues and no smell remained.\nAnd all is well.", "Agreed. I've had a knee injury where I couldn't bend my leg much, so extremely tiny bathrooms posed an issue even though I'm not a big person, but a) That was my responsibility to disclose, and b) That doesn't mean I had the right to use anybody's private master bathroom.", "He may have wanted to steal your meds. NTA.", "I think his legitimate reason was claustrophobia. It used to be a closet.", "My thought was that he had to take a shit.... but maybe I'm naive lol", "Getting to meds was the first thought I had as well. Or he wants to get to something that would be in there. Jewelry? Panties? I've heard stories of contractors creeping on women in homes they are working on. If OP has this guy coming back for more work, they better watch him like a hawk.", "Or 4. He wanted to raid the medicine cabinet.", "Yep.  My husband and I were having a major renovation done many years ago, and we had several contractors give us estimates.\n\nI was home alone for many of these.  One guy came and gave a reasonable estimate and didn't do or say anything wrong. \n\nBut, he gave me the creeps, and I can't say why.  Since I would be home alone with a toddler during the work, I said no way.  My husband trusted my instincts and we moved on.", "Some people never assume the worst and always wanna make people feel comfortable in their home. \nSo\u2026 her husband might be one of those people. \nHowever\u2026 her gut said no. That\u2019s fair and shouldn\u2019t be discouraged.", " especially when he's only been there half an hour to do some quotes, this isn't like he's been on the job for seven hours and can't wait as long as he thought he could due to a bad lunch that needed out immediately", "Yea, honestly all the comments about embarrassment and GI issues are very thoughtful, but this dude literally works in other people's homes for a living, he might even have to use port-a-potties on the regular - he's going to have to get used to pooping in other peoples houses at some point.", "Would vastly prefer to clean and close off the guest bathroom because of smell than to have to do so in my private bathroom in my bedroom", "A lot of other comments have said he may have wanted to trifle through the medicine cabinet for prescription drugs. \n\nAre that many drugs in American households that they're a target when it comes to this kind of thing? That is so scary. They'd be hard pressed to find ibuprofen in my cabinet. They'll take the mouth wash and PitRok and like it!", "Well\u2026 those kinda noises aren\u2019t pleasant for strangers to hear\u2026", "Building codes require residential bathrooms to have windows.", "This was actually my first thought. Only reason I could think of for him saying it was a little small for him.", "Yeah, I'm claustrophobic and I don't like smaller bathrooms. I generally won't use the one in my own house, and my in-laws have one that's so small I won't use it at all. But in a stranger's house, I'd suck it up. It'd make more sense if he had asked for a different bathroom rather than specifically the master bathroom.", "Then he wouldn't have said he'd wait", "If that were the case, then he would have taken the first bathroom that was offered to him.", "What hidden disability would require the use of a master bathroom versus a half bathroom?", "Saying \"I'll hold it because you won't grant me access to your bedroom\" indicates the request had nothing to do with any kind of urgent situation", "Turn on the fan for noise.  No need to waste water.", "Oh a white noise app that\u2019s a great idea!", "What does a GI disease have to do with bathroom choice?", "That\u2019s a good reason to use the bathroom. That\u2019s not a good reason to insist on using the master bedroom\u2019s private bathroom.", "Genuine question, as someone with a GI disease - why would this mean he had to use the master bath?\n\nAnd I kinda feel like that isn\u2019t the case here because he was able to wait, idk. When I have an episode waiting is not usually an option, but I guess that could depend on the specific condition. *If* this person did indeed have one, that is.", "He could have been looking for drugs.  People don\u2019t keep medicine in half bathrooms.", "Why couldn't he poop or dump a colostomy bag in the half-bath?", "A half bath is a private place to change/dump an ostomy bag.  \n\nEnsuits are were people keep, jewelry and medications. To people even a little bit sensitive to the possibility of theft requesting a bath room in the bedroom is a red flag. Also\" let me walk around more of the house \" was a used in some robbery at a point in time.", "Could be he was claustrophobic, too.", "he could be claustrophobic too", "If that were the case, he would've asked if they had another bathroom, not to specifically use the master bathroom.", "That's exactly what it was.", "Or get her alone while she was leading him there. It's not specifically stated, but I read it as her husband wasn't home to overrule her \"no\" in the moment. Having the contractor's ask be for her to lead him to the bedroom is just so ick.", "If he needed to poop, the guest bathroom works just as well as the master.", "So a master bathroom is a family bathroom attached to or near the largest bedroom of the house.  Not every house has those.  Every house does have a bathroom that includes toilet, shower, sink.  Half bath is just toilet and sink.\n\nEven if he was cleaning out a bag, he wouldn\u2019t need the master specifically, just a full bath.  I just don\u2019t get it tbh.  This whole scenario mystifies me lol", "Believe me, if it was a colostomy bag the option to wait would not be on the table if you were already asking strangers to use their restroom.", "I don't think it's like...every American bathroom is packed to the gills with pills. But it's pretty common I'd say for someone to have to go through something painful, get strong pain medication for it, and then not need it all and either just not throw it out or save it just in case they might need it in another painful situation later. And then you multiply that times multiple people in a family and while you're probably not guaranteed to find something, it's not uncommon.\n\nAnd that's leaving aside things like mental health medications.", "Enough that if you search every house you work on, periodically you\u2019ll score a forgotten half unused bottle of Vicodin from that tooth extraction 6 years ago.", "Not in all cases. I live in a new, up-to-code apartment building and certainly don't have a window in my bathroom", "This definitely depends on where you live and isn\u2019t true everywhere. I\u2019ve never heard of this requirement anywhere I\u2019ve lived. My last several bathrooms in both Nevada and California have not had windows, and these were all in large apartment complexes where everything was very above board.\n\nedit: I googled it and it seems a fan suffices in most instances, all my bathrooms have had fans in lieu of windows.", "Depends on where you are. I have 2 bathrooms with no windows, although 1 originally had a window that was covered when the addition was built.", "I also think that most likely the guy had claustrophobia, since he'd rather not use the bathroom at all instead of settling for the small one. However, I would say NAH. There are plenty of reasons not to let strangers into your main bathroom where a lot of private things are kept, and unless he indicated that it was an emergency, you weren't an AH for saying no. He also wasn't an AH for asking, and then stepping down after being declined.", "Not all bathrooms have a fan, especially a half bath with no shower", "Master bath is where people keep jewelry/controlled prescriptions.", "He wanted to drop a deuce in the tub.", "....a half bath seems like a great place for a guest to poop or empty a colostomy bag.", "He didn't insist. He asked, she refused, he said \"I'll wait then\".", "He didn't insist, though. He just asked if there was another bathroom, and when he told it wasnt available to him, made a choice he was okay with. Tbh, this sounds a bit like claustrophobia to me. My close friend is 5ft 3in and would probably rather piss himself than use a bathroom with no window that used to be a closet. Most people also don't take it seriously when you bring it up, assuming you can just suck it up for a while. My friend will almost never mention it unless he has no choice and would have also opted to just hold it and wait. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOp is not an AH but neither is the guy for simply inquiring if there was another bathroom and then opting not to use any of them when he was uncomfortable with the one offered for any reason.
