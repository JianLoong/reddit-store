Had a contractor come over to get estimates on some renovations to the kitchen. After about 30 minutes of being here, he asked if he could use our bathroom. Of course we said yes and led him to a small bathroom (half bath, used to be a large closet) we have specifically for guests. He said thanks, hesitated, then said, \u201cDo you guys have another one I can use? This is just.. too small for me. Do you have a master bath I can use?\u201d\n\nUmm\u2026 not that I minded at all, but this threw up a ton of weird feelings/red flags. Too small? The man was 120 lbs soaking wet, not disabled to my knowledge, and I\u2019m a rarely thick woman who has no trouble sitting in the bathroom with the door completely closed. The ceiling is high, so I don\u2019t see the height being an issue.\n\nAnyway, I said, \u201cOh we prefer guests not to use our bathroom in the bedroom.\u201d He looked at me and said, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll just wait then.\u201d\n\nMy husband told me I was pretty rude. But my opinion is that the whole interaction was very weird and I was right to be suspicious. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: spelling. Rarely thick = relatively thick\n\nEdit 2: To answer some of the common questions I\u2019ve seen in the comments, we did not know the man personally. Yes, he specifically requested a master bath. Yes, the guest bath had everything he would have needed. It\u2019s fully functional with soap, a towel, toilet paper, and a trash can. The sink is in front of the toilet with a reasonable amount of space between them. We do have another bathroom he could have used that was bigger, and we wouldn\u2019t have minded him using it. I was just so taken aback when he specifically requested the master bath that I didn\u2019t really think of offering the 3rd bathroom.", "created_utc": 1680726066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cwmnt/aita_for_not_letting_our_contractor_use_his/", "score": 2007, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This doesn't make sense to me though because the average bathroom stall is going to be larger than a half bath.  Hell, the average single cab pickup truck is going to feel smaller than a half bath.  And GC's tend to have to go into small enclosed spaces on the regular.  Closets, crawl spaces, attics etc etc\n\n2) He to use the master bathroom is because that is where people tend to keep their prescription medications\n\n3) u/returnof_datbooty made a good point.  A 3rd scenario could involve spy cameras.  Master bathrooms would have the most naked people traffic presumably.  So it makes sense to try and get in there if you are a perv\n\nMe personally?  I would assume #2 is the reason he wanted to use the master bathroom and would throw away his project estimate\n\nI feel like if he was claustraphobic, he would have said something.  Plenty of people have that phobia.  It's a simple explanation for the request.  And he specifically mentioned the master bathroom.  He didn't ask if there was a larger bathroom....like a regular sized guest bathroom or hall bathroom other than the master.\n\nHe wanted to go into the master...specifically\n\nAnd the fact he didn't attempt to explain the request AND used the \"I'm too big for the half bathroom\" even though you said he was a relatively thin person...again reinforces the idea that he was looking for drugs\n\nEDIT:  Adding a 3rd option because someone made a really good point in a comment", "Nta.

When I moved into my new townhome, one of the movers took a massive dump in my master bathroom. I was horrified then, and I\u2019m horrified now. So I understand.", "NTA - this sounds like he wanted to search the cabinet for drugs.", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019d hire a different contractor. Asking specifically for the master bath is very strange and would probably creep me out if a total stranger asked to enter the most private area in my home when they really have no business being in there.", "NTA. I think it is weird for a stranger to use the master bath. Hell, I don\u2019t even like family members using my master bath.", "FULL STOP, he might be on that reddit for sh*t pics. They take pics in risky places. Like someone else's master bedroom.", "NTA, I would be weirded out by this request too! However, it did occur to me, maybe he is wary of tight spaces? It sounds like it\u2019s a small bathroom, but still a super weird ask to use a \u2018master bath\u2019 instead.", "NAH. I don't see the problem in asking but it could be kind of weird. Is it possible the bathroom wasn't big enough and they wanted to pray? It is Ramadan.", "NTA. He could have been intending to look for prescription drugs or install a camera in the bathroom you use most... your husband should be thanking you for being the only one with sense enough to decline this contractor's oddly specific and suspicious request... thankfully you have good instincts. You were not rude at all. He asked for a bathroom and you kindly showed him one. It's up to him if he decides to use it or not, but you were still polite and accommodating towards him... just because you didn't fulfill his every whim doesn't mean you're rude. If anything, he was rude.", "It was rude of him to ask, and you were right on to not let him in your personal bathroom.  You don't know this man, and leaving him alone with so much personal stuff. Nope, no way!  \nI don't understand why your husband would think you are rude.  It is not rude to tell someone no.  Your husband should have agreed with you and not made you doubt yourself.  Since the guy decided to wait, that tells me he did not really need to go and was up to no good!", "Nta he probably wanted to look for prescription drugs if I had to guess", "NTA - only I poop in the master toilet in my house ! Is your reply.", "NTA", "NTA. This is he guest bath, utilize or hold it.", "Dude was definitely planning on sniffing your dirty panties from your hamper.", "I would guess he\u2019s looking for drugs. You don\u2019t leave your drugs in the guest bathroom; you have them on the medicine cabinet in the master bathroom.", "Or he could have been claustrophobic or disabled in some way. If he wanted to steal stuff he wouldn't have been so blatant about asking, any thefts would have been obvious and immediately directed at him.\n\nNAH", "Could be that the guy\u2019s well endowed, and the powder room toilet had too high a water level or a cramped circular bowl rather than an elongated one.\n\nYes, both of those are real issues. Porcelain and toilet water are both cold, and if the bowl isn\u2019t clean, bathing your dong in it is gross.", "I feel for the contractor, he's probably just claustrophobic and didn't want to share his mental health issues on the job.", "You can really only think of two reasons? And both of them are him being a criminal?\n\nWhat about embarrassed and claustrophobic, or embarrassed and disabled. There are many other reasons why someone might ask this without going into details, and it's a shame everyone is immediately jumping to him trying to rob OP", "WHAT THE FUCK", "Wait\u2026\u2026\u2026 what.", "This is a totally realistic possibility that I had not thought of.", "This is such a Reddit comment. This is really what you\u2019re going with? Maybe the guy wanted to use OP\u2019s bathroom to dump his colostomy bag and that\u2019s why he shouldn\u2019t have to give a good reason to use the master?", "That was #2.", "A claustrophobic man who is too disabled to operate a bathroom without a a shower in it should not be a contractor.\n\nAlso, he did not ask for a larger bathroom or a more private bathroom. He specifically asked for the bathroom connected to their bedroom. What disability requires you to be near someone's bedroom to use a toilet?", "Not offended, just pointing out.", "How would he know the bathroom was ensuite?  As it turns out, there was another bigger bathroom that he could have used that she apparently forgot about. Who the fuck \u2018forgets\u2019 how many bathrooms are in their house?", "DING DING DING", "So you'd prefer to \"explode\" in someone's master bathroom? That's disgusting. Are you going to clean it afterward?", "You\u2019re describing an ensuite bathroom.  \n\nReal Estate agents don\u2019t use \u2018master\u2019 anymore because it is problematic.  I see you understand Google so you cold figure it out, if you wanted to.", "If principal is a synonym for master why not just use that word, with no negative connotations?", "I thought of medication hunting.", "A colostomy bag collects waste from the small intestines, in which food hasn't been fully processed, and it smells like a sewer. I had relatives who had colostomy bags, so I have had experience with this, second hand. Also, it is the consistency of diarrhea, and can splash and splatter in the commode, and can make a big mess.", "Right, my head went to my addict sister who always snooped in master bedrooms for pills \n\nNTA", "They literally mean the same thing. You\u2019re being pedantic. \n\nhttps://www.maxrealestateexposure.com/what-en-suite-mean/", "Upvoted because I know what this is", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.", "It is irrational", "I guess not everyone does\u2026I have Crohns though and tbh any bathroom is a savior at that immediate moment, I wouldn\u2019t have time to even think asking about for a larger bathroom.", "But sharing is caring. \ud83e\udd23", "Lol that\u2019s so weird. Anyone can buy Sudafed over the counter. They just card you if it\u2019s one of the stronger ones. Maybe your coworker makes meth or whatever it is that they can make with Sudafed.", "My thoughts as well.  It\u2019s not unheard of for people to scope out a place to see if anything is worth stealing.  He doesn\u2019t even have to be the thief himself, he could pass on the info to other interested parties.", "Yeah I almost certain that's what it's for. Either she makes it or someone she knows does and she's collecting the meth for them. You have to show your ID to get Sudafed now because of this. Once you've gotten on the radar of pharmacies and made your way around town to all the various Walgreens and CVS locations, it gets harder and harder to get it without raising suspicion. So you resort to stealing I would imagine.", "That was my first thought as well. \nI have noticed that every time a contractor, technician, furniture delivery, anyone like that comes to my house, they always ask to use the bathroom. Always.  I often thought it was odd, sometimes it would be people who are in and out for five minutes, and I have a convenience store with a public bathroom right down the road, but then it finally dawned on me that at least some of them were probably snooping through medicine cabinets to steal.  \nUnless they were after Clinique samples and Advil, they were out of luck here.", "This was my first thought.  My contractor's employee straight up asked for meds. We have a little basket on the table, and he asked if the \"strong stuff\" was in there. I said no.", "This... my first thought was dude was looking for a place to get a fix", "Same"]}
