She and my brother have 4 kids together and she definitely wears the pants in the relationship. \n\nMy nephews (they are twins) are turning 9 and my SIL wants to have a family birthday party for them. My family lives relatively close to one another (30 minutes or so) with the exception of my brother and SIL, who live about 2 hours away from all of us. \n\nMy SIL is planning to have the birthday party at her home with just my family, her parents (they live near her), and her sisters family (equal distance between our family and my brother/SIL). After speaking with my mom, I called my SIL and asked if we could relocate the party to my parents house. I am 37 weeks pregnant, will be closer to 39 weeks at the time of the party,  and would feel more comfortable closer to home. Two hours in the car at 39 weeks pregnant is a lot, not to mention feeling nervous about the possibility of going into labor. I told my SIL that my mom (and myself to the best I can) can plan/pay for everything for the party since they would have to make the trip to us- my mom had agreed to this. She could still plan and do whatever she wanted, but the thought was to compromise and take some of the pressure off of her in return of her relocating so I could be there. \n\nMy SIL refuses. She said that it is her kids, her party, and must be done at her house. She said it was selfish and disrespectful of me to even ask. She said that it takes the boys out of their environment, their older girls (12 and 14) would not be able to hang out with friends after the party, and now her parents would have to make the trip too. I tried to reason with her but she wasn\u2019t having it. She said I was ruining my nephew\u2019s party by causing this tension and if I didn\u2019t want to come I didn\u2019t have to. She accused me of using my pregnancy as an excuse to gain control. \n\nAs it stands now, the party is at her house and my husband and I will not be going. I am just not comfortable being that far from home so close to giving birth and clearly she didn\u2019t want to take me up on my offer to make the party easier for her and have all of our family together. She is mad at my mom not too for not telling me that I was being ridiculous. My parents are still going to the party (as they should, but I\u2019m sure my SIL will make it known that she is upset with my mom). \n\nAITA for asking my sister to relocate my nephew\u2019s birthday so I could attend?", "created_utc": 1681052242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12glpp5/aita_for_ruining_my_nephews_birthday_party/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were making it easier for you. \n\nYou\u2019ll be 39 weeks pregnant\u2014 planning a party with your mom or going to a party 2 hours away are both a bad idea. Just don\u2019t go.\n\nEdit: corrected typo", "YTA. You're asking her (and her family) to do a lot more that day just to make you more comfortable. I get not wanting to travel much while pregnant. But that means you just have to stay home, not that everyone else rearranges their lives for you.", "YTA. It\u2019s HER children\u2019s birthday and you expect her to travel 2 hours for the party? If you can\u2019t make it, just say that. I can\u2019t imagine why you and SIL have tension\u2026", "YTA.\nIt's your nephew's party, not yours. You don't get to demand everyone change their plans to accomodate you. You are (or would have been) a guest, not the person the party was for. You can't come? Fine. Extend your regrets. But it is incredibly self-centered to request that the host change someone else's birthday party just for you.", "YTA 100% - I'm pissed on your SIL's behalf, because this is nuts. It's even more nuts that you think it's okay to try and highjack the party and spin it as you're somehow helping. \n\n>but do have a rocky relationship with my SIL\n\nI'm not surprised. You seem like a massively exhausting inlaw. The world doesn't revolve around you.", "YTA. When you\u2019re invited to a party, your options are to accept or decline the invitation. You don\u2019t get to take over & redefine someone else\u2019s party for your convenience.", "YTA for asking her to move a party SHE is hosting 2 hours away from HER house! YTA for saying your SIL wears the pants in the family. That is misogynistic. \n\nIf you didn't feel comfortable traveling 2 hours away during your final weeks or your pregnancy (perfectly understandable), you should have just let her know you would not be able to attend. Your sense of entitlement is unbelievable, and you request was ridiculous!", "> She said it was selfish and disrespectful of me to even ask.\n\nShe is correct.\n\n> She accused me of using my pregnancy as an excuse to gain control.\n\nShe is correct again. YTA", "YTA\n\nShe is right that it's perfectly reasonable to want to  have the party at her house and she's given you some valid reasons. \n\nIt's not her fault or the kids' fault you are heavily pregnant.\n\nYou can miss one birthday party, for goodness sake.\n\nYou are not the central character in everyone else's story.", "YTA - It's not reasonable to ask someone to relocate someone else's party to accommodate your needs. If you're not comfortable being that far from home right now, send your regrets and don't go.", "YTA for asking her to change the location to suit you. That's ridiculous. Maybe your husband could have went without you. Or just send a sincere regret of not being able to attend along with a nice gift for the twins. Your mom is the TA too for going along with this nonsense.", "op=YTA\n\nyou wrote it very well. Everyone's within 30 minutes of ME. Except you said YOUR Family.\n\nYou didn't address that the birthday twins friends would be 2 hours away, the sister's friends would be two hours away, SIL's family would be How far away?\n\nSo it doesn't make you the AH to ask(I guess),  But it definitely makes you the AH to try to insist.  <*I tried to reason with her*\\>  Guess what you are not the main character of this birthday party.  \n\nAfter you were so bold as to ask, AFTER she refused, your gracious response should be, *I hate the idea of missing it, but I don't feel comfortable being away from my doctor/hospital so I will have to spoil the nephews extra for next year's birthday.  Mom will be bringing their presents for me.  Thank you for listening to my request.*", "YTA. The last paragraph should have been what you decided from the start. You don't get to ask someone to relocate their entire function so you can go. You're 39 weeks- JUST DONT GO.", "YTA and you really need to check your main character syndrome now that you're about to be a parent. I don't know why you think your presence is so important that your nephew's whole party should be relocated 2 hours away from his home just for your comfort, but you need to understand that you aren't at the center of everyone's lives, and very soon now you'll need to get used to putting someone else's needs ahead of your own.", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn't have pushed.  She probably has all their toys and stuff at her house. A invitation is not a summons, once they said no they wouldn't be moving it, you respectfully decline.  As a parent, you won't always be able to make it to every single family event", "YTA. Not everything in life is about you. If you don\u2019t want to go, politely decline. Don\u2019t expect to make yourself the focal point of somebody else\u2019s day\u2014and then get mad and stomp your feet when they don\u2019t agree.", "YTA Is like adding SIL to cancel the party, in case you go into labor at 39 weeks. Next, you will want shared birthday parties. You with help your mother set up the party? At 39 weeks? Isn't set up and clean up just as uncomfortable as traveling to the party?  My guess is you want everyone around you at a children's birthday party.", "YTA and newsflash, SIL doesn\u2019t care that you can\u2019t make it!", "Total YTA. What happens if you go into labour the day of the party? Or the day before? You won't be there. You are right not to want to drive 2 hours to get there, but the party is for her kids, not you.", "YTA I honestly don't understand why you need to attend a child's birthday party.", "YTA.  This is not your party or your kids. Politely decline the invitation then back off & mind your own business.", "YTA. If you\u2019re too pregnant to go that\u2019s fine. Just don\u2019t go. The world won\u2019t stop spinning if the nine-year-olds\u2019 aunt misses their birthday party.", "YTA. If it\u2019s too much for you to go to a children\u2019s birthday party it\u2019s your right not to go. Why should they travel 2 hours to have their own children\u2019s party? It\u2019s extremely entitled of you to think that your presence at the party is so important that they should change the location so drastically.", "YTA\nYou should have just said you weren\u2019t coming due to your advance pregnancy and been done with it. You made the issue about you, not your nephew.", "YTA. An invitation to a party is just that, an invitation. It\u2019s not a summons. When you realized you wouldn\u2019t be able to travel to it, the correct response was to decline and leave it at that. You are not the reason for the party or the most important guest so why you thought an entire child\u2019s party should be moved to you is just weird.", "OK this one is hard to judge because no one's birthday was ruined by one person being there, in fact, everyone understood that you, might not be there because of pregnancy nor give you a hard time over it. it is a child's birthday after all\n\nSo to relocate this birthday party, others being children, multiple children and your nephews would have to be driven 2 hours to your grandparents, so YOU could be there. So do tell me how fair is that?\n\nyour SIL is right, it's her and her husband's children's birthday party, and that's it\n\nAlso \n\n\"She said that it takes the boys out of their environment, their older girls (12 and 14) would not be able to hang out with friends after the party, and now her parents would have to make the trip too.\"\n\nSo because of your desires, everyone else has to be inconvenienced \n\nbut let me be clear, you just don't like your SIL for \"wearing the pants\", right that it. So was even asking just a power trip, or was your intention to make the birthday party, all about you?\n\nYTA but congrats on the baby", "YTA. How hard was it to just say, \u201cSorry, I won\u2019t be a be to make it, wish little _____ a happy birthday for me!\u201d \n\nLike why did you have to have a main character moment thinking a whole party would be relocated just for you", "YTA.\n\nIt isn\u2019t reasonable to request everyone change their plans to accommodate your pregnancy. It is reasonable to call and tell them that you and your husband will not be able to attend, due to the birthday party being so close to your due date. That\u2019s all you had to say.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you and your mother are willing to host the event, this is her family\u2019s event to plan as they see fit.\n\nI was kind of leaning toward \u2018everyone sucks\u2019, because she does sound like an unpleasant person, but you never should have asked her to to relocate the party to accommodate you. Your reasons for not wanting to travel are legitimate, but that just means you don\u2019t attend the party.", "YTA. Why do you think you have ANY say in where someone else's party is?", "You don\u2019t want to go because you will be 39 weeks pregnant - that makes sense and I\u2019m sure your whole family and your SIL\u2019s family would understand why you and your husband wouldn\u2019t be able to attend. But to expect everyone to move to you for your nephew\u2019s party is insane! And what if you did go into labour at a party that you are now hosting? Just decline the invite and leave it at that. YTA for making an event about you that wasn\u2019t actually for you.", "YTA\n\nHow selfish and entitled can you be?\n\n\"clearly she didn\u2019t want to take me up on my offer to make the party easier for her and have all of our family together\"\n\nThe party would only be easier for you, everyone else (her, her parents and her children) would have to inconvenience themselves traveling.", "yta", "YTA, it's not your party.", "Sorry, but YTA. Your reasoning is absolutely acceptable and I wish you and the little one all the best in the world. About the party, she gave you perfect reasoning why it should be at her home.", "YTA - not surprised you have a rocky relationship, I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with you either. Even as the kid I would think your an ah. Like, we have to leave home for my birthday? Unless you were planning on renting out a chuckie cheeses that\u2019s near by, I\u2019d be upset.", "Wow the nerve of you! Acting like you were giving her some wonderful gift and taking the pressure off her, whilst really, you were asserting control over the party due to your pregnancy. Just don\u2019t go, you\u2019re not going to be in any shape to go and so you don\u2019t go. You don\u2019t try and change everything to suit you. That\u2019s incredibly self centred and your SIL is 100% right. YTA", "YTA! Not your party, not your your way. Just decline the invite. After your little one is born. You can dictate how their party will go. I would find it hilarious if SIL pulled this stunt for your kids birthday party. Just for a dose of your own medicine.", "YTA - It isn't always about you. I can see why you don't get along well with her.", "Omg, of course YTA. You had a completely irrational response to this birthday party.\n\nIf you don't want to go, for whatever reason, then don't. But to make everyone else change their plans because of it is ridiculous.", "YTA! All you had to do is say I\u2019m sorry but I won\u2019t be able to attend due to being not being comfortable to travel right now. That\u2019s it. You\u2019re (and your mother) the one making it a big to do. Why should she have to rearrange her sons birthday party for you? That\u2019s not fair to her family.  As the youngest you\u2019re probably used to getting whatever you want and SIL don\u2019t play into that.  \n\nAs per your comment is it outlandish to ask?\u2026.YES IT IS!  It\u2019s her kids birthday. She can plan it the way she wants to do. Get over yourself.", "Oh yes, YTA. Your nephews' party needs to be focused on them, not you. You are being reasonable in not wanting to travel at this stage in your pregnancy. You are being unreasonable in expecting your SIL to cater to you. You are not the star here. \n\nSince it would be very simple to send gifts for the boys and explain why you cannot go, what is really going on here? It's clear you don't like your SIL. Is this some sort of power play for you? Proving you are more important to the family than her? If so, drop it. Life is too short and family too precious. At the rate you are going, your child will not know their cousins. Unless that is your actual goal. If so, then carry on.", "Lmao why are u trying to make a child's birthday party about you it's bizzare.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA. Soft, but still. So soft it\u2019s borderline N-A-H, but falls on YTA for the trying to reason with her.\n\nSIL is still right that it\u2019s her sons party, and that it\u2019s ultimately her decision. It might\u2019ve been sweet that you tried to come up with an alternative, but if she said no. Then she said no. \n\nYour SIL is perfectly within her right to say no, and her reasons are justified enough. \n\nThere\u2019s 0 reasons why you must be at the party. It would be nice, but you aren\u2019t owed anything there.\n\nSIL set up a condition, at that point the solution is simple: say you\u2019re not comfortable driving that far a distance, and send gifts with your Mom. Then wish them a good day, promise to show up next year, and enjoy your own relaxing afternoon.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not about you! If you\u2019re uncomfortable with travel at this time, that\u2019s understandable; asking everyone else to change plans that are not about you AROUND you, that\u2019s not. \n\nApologize, say you just went a bit coocoo trying to fix a non-existent problem, and then shush about it.", "INFO when your SIL was pregnant was she expected to make the 2 hour drive to come to see your family?", "I mean, they are 9, I\u2019m sure they love you but I doubt they\u2019ll be devastated if you don\u2019t attend. In the nicest possible way, get over yourself x", "I feel like it would be better just to ask if you could plan a day where they visit. Then you can make have a nice dinner with the nephews and give them the gifts you wanted to give them. It could be a special aunt day, instead of moving the whole celebration. I get feeling sad you have to miss out, but maybe they could at least get you on FaceTime to say Happy Birthday.\n\nSo kind of YTA.", "YTA. All you had to say was \u201cgosh, I\u2019ll be almost 39 weeks pregnant at that time, so we won\u2019t be able to make it. Hope you all have a great day!\u201d\n\nInstead, you did your best to make your nephews\u2019 party all about you when, in fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with you. The fact that you aren\u2019t self aware enough to realize this (without a bunch of strangers on the internet telling you) says a lot about why you don\u2019t have a great relationship with your SIL.", "YTA. Just don't go? It's a nine year old's birthday. It's not some once in a lifetime event. Send a gift for the kids and don't worry about it. It's absurd to ask them to move it for you.", "Who do you think you are, the queen.\n\nThe audacity of even asking. I would have chewed you out far more than your SIL.\n\nIn case you lack the braincells, the birthday boy couldn't give a rats ass if you are there.\n\nYTA and completely oblivious if you thought that was at all a reasonable request.", "YTA", "YTA. You don't need to be at this party. It is not for you and does not need to be changed to suit your needs.", "Another day another person in reddit who thinks the world should accommodate to her just because she's pregnant YTA", "YTA. That party isn't about you, or whether you can attend. \n\nYou could have simply sent your regrets, mentioning at 39wks you prefer to stay closer to home", "Sorry, but yes YTA. Her kids, her party, you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go.", "YTA\n\nYou're not required to attend the party if you're not physically able, but to push someone to change the venue and planning **just** for you is pretty assholish. To continue to feign like you're the victim in this situation, because your SIL wouldn't accommodate you with a significant change to the party, is pretty ridiculous of you.", "YTA. There was nothing wrong with asking, and there was nothing wrong with her saying no. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with choosing not to go given how close you are to your due date. That said, why are you making a huge deal out of this? That\u2019s what makes you TA.", "YTA for insisting she move her party and then not taking no for an answer. I totally understand the concern of a long drive while pregnant, there\u2019s nothing wrong with worrying about what can go wrong when you\u2019re *that close* to having a baby. But you don\u2019t get to *use that fear to bully the people around you in to completely rearranging their plans.* You don\u2019t have to attend. Send a gift and a card and apologize instead, video call with them later to say happy birthday, whatever else will probably be okay with your SIL to make up for you not attending, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be more than understanding of your concerns and decisions to stay home. You need to learn to take no for an answer. She said no, that\u2019s final. \n\nShe accused you of using your pregnancy to gain control, and she\u2019s right, you are. You said your relationship with her is rocky, and with how you\u2019re acting, I\u2019m not surprised. \n\nJust in case you missed it, OP, no means no. She said no. That means no. You don\u2019t get to push. \n\nCongrats on the baby, OP.", "YTA this childrens\u2019 birthday party is not about you. If you are unable to attend due to your condition, you simply say so, and send a gift with your parents. You could even ask them to FaceTime with you when the kids open the gift since you couldn\u2019t be there. You don\u2019t get to hijack the entire event for your convenience.

She and my brother have 4 kids together and she definitely wears the pants in the relationship. \n\nMy nephews (they are twins) are turning 9 and my SIL wants to have a family birthday party for them. My family lives relatively close to one another (30 minutes or so) with the exception of my brother and SIL, who live about 2 hours away from all of us. \n\nMy SIL is planning to have the birthday party at her home with just my family, her parents (they live near her), and her sisters family (equal distance between our family and my brother/SIL). After speaking with my mom, I called my SIL and asked if we could relocate the party to my parents house. I am 37 weeks pregnant, will be closer to 39 weeks at the time of the party,  and would feel more comfortable closer to home. Two hours in the car at 39 weeks pregnant is a lot, not to mention feeling nervous about the possibility of going into labor. I told my SIL that my mom (and myself to the best I can) can plan/pay for everything for the party since they would have to make the trip to us- my mom had agreed to this. She could still plan and do whatever she wanted, but the thought was to compromise and take some of the pressure off of her in return of her relocating so I could be there. \n\nMy SIL refuses. She said that it is her kids, her party, and must be done at her house. She said it was selfish and disrespectful of me to even ask. She said that it takes the boys out of their environment, their older girls (12 and 14) would not be able to hang out with friends after the party, and now her parents would have to make the trip too. I tried to reason with her but she wasn\u2019t having it. She said I was ruining my nephew\u2019s party by causing this tension and if I didn\u2019t want to come I didn\u2019t have to. She accused me of using my pregnancy as an excuse to gain control. \n\nAs it stands now, the party is at her house and my husband and I will not be going. I am just not comfortable being that far from home so close to giving birth and clearly she didn\u2019t want to take me up on my offer to make the party easier for her and have all of our family together. She is mad at my mom not too for not telling me that I was being ridiculous. My parents are still going to the party (as they should, but I\u2019m sure my SIL will make it known that she is upset with my mom). \n\nAITA for asking my sister to relocate my nephew\u2019s birthday so I could attend?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would happily entertain this arrangement for my children to accommodate my 39 weeks pregnant SIL.  Your SIL\u2019s reaction seems pretty aggressive when a simple \u201cno thanks\u201d would have sufficed.

She invited you and you can choose to accept or decline. A simple \"I would love to be there to celebrate, but I'm a little nervous about being so far away being so close to my due date\" and she most likely would understand ( I don't know her personality but in general most people would understand). But you cannot expect her to plan her children's birthday party at YOUR convenience because you are pregnant. At first it was sounding like she could consider having it near you guys because it would benefit the majority (not just you) because they were the only ones that were a good distance away and that EVERYONE would be making a two hour trip to them. In that case I was starting to think that it maaaay have been nice of her to try to make it convenient for the majority so only one family has a two hour trip instead of a few families. But again, she's definitely not obligated to. And then you mentioned she also has family on her side that would then have to travel too. So idk maybe she wouldn't't feel comfortable asking HER family to travel that distance to host the party HIS families home. So it does seem like just having the party at their own house is a pretty neutral place. So if you were truly asking for the convenience of the majority I would say you're not an asshole for asking, but she's not an asshole for declining. Buuuut it sounds like you were really asking for your own convenience, so for that you're a little selfish. And again, you can decline the invite if you want but she shouldn't make her decision based on one person.", "YTA. It\u2019s her and her kids\u2019 party and there\u2019s no reason to make it convenient for anyone else but themselves. Like someone said, you can accept or decline as an INVITEE.

I know MY husband feels the same way and we aren\u2019t going to deny I wear the pants. YTA all the way to the moon and back", "Yes, YTA for asking.  It\u2019s incredibly short sighted of you as it\u2019s clear you\u2019re only focus on yourself and not your nephews (whose party is focus on).  \n\nThere\u2019s nothing written from your post where your presence is important to the twins. If you had a close relationship with the twins where they\u2019ll be devastated that you\u2019re not around - okay, sure, I can understand why you figured what you offered is a compromise.\n\nBut all you talked about was how you\u2019re pregnant, how risky it is for you to make a long travel, etc.  There\u2019s nothing in your post about how you have a close relationship with your nephews.  It\u2019s ironic for you to talk about being nervous about going into labor during the drive to the party\u2026 and yet you discounted the fact you might go into labor before or during the party, which effectively makes it useless for them to even have a party at your parents house if they chose to change the venue for just for you. \n\nYou asked your SIL to make a 4 Hr round trip party to your parents home just so you can feel comfortable.  And it seems like you discounted the fact that her parents, who are probably a lot more active and present in their children\u2019s life, would need to make equally as long of a trip.  And this is all to accommodate you.\n\nAnd despite how much you want to paint your SIL as a hysterical person - I bet you\u2019re only telling half of the story.  Obviously most people would think she\u2019s overreacting by saying you\u2019re ruining her sons birthday party.

Ridiculous!\n\nYou're claiming it's to take the pressure of your SIL, but that's a lie. SIL never asked for your help or mentioned any pressure. This is about you wanting to control things and make it about yourself because it's clear you are only thinking about yourself.\nThey invited you to a bday party, if you can't go, then don't, it that simple. They didn't ask for another venue, they didn't ask for help with the party, and they didn't ask for anyone else to host.\n\nI feel sorry for your future, baby.

So if All-Important Princess Aunt can't be there, of course her husband must go there to represent her. \n\nFunny how you are worried that you might give birth while your husband's at the party 2 hours away, but you're not worried about making everyone else drive hours when you very likely will be unable to attend anyway.", "Omg!

It's their birthday, not yours.  You are entitled OP and I get why SIL did what she did.  Grow up.", "The kids won\u2019t have their friends. And would have to travel 4 hrs in the car in their bday. Their mom would rather clean and spend money than travel to you per your demand.", "Sounds like she'd rather have clean up...at her house than what you want to convince her to do.", "No. YTA for even asking. Accept or decline. Period.", "Yeah, here's the thing though. The \"favour\" you offered to your SIL wasn't to benefit the boys on their birthday. It was to benefit you. Your argument that SIL wouldn't be responsible for clean up is weak, and honestly brazen of you - Seeing as you're *too pregnant* to travel you must be *too pregnant* to help with any clean up yourself, so this actually involves even more people doing things to accomodate you. The 9 year old boys might care for precisely 1 minute that their pregnant aunt (who they don't see often) is present. I'll bet they care for 0 minutes that she isn't. By the way you speak of your SIL I'm guessing she isn't broken hearted that you won't make it. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to accommodate you in this situation. It's your nephews' birthday, not YOUR birthday. You are not a priority here.\n\nNow, lets say IF you were close and on (at least) respectful terms with your SIL, it wouldn't have been unreasonable for you to casually MENTION to her, \"Hey, I'm bummed I wont be able to make the trip for the boys birthdy, would you consider holding the party at Mom's if I could make arrangements with her and we took care of everything?\"... BEFORE you went ahead and made any sort of arrangements or mentioned it to your Mom or anyone else. And when she said no, the only correct response would be \"Dang haha, OK no problem I understand. I'll send their gift with Mom, give them hugs for me!\"... Not to start spouting off about 'who wears the pants' or to go to the internet looking for at least one person to agree with you.\n\nJust a reminder, your perception of your SIL has no actual bearing on who she is. Sounds like you need to take a good hard look at your own behavior and spend less time casting judgement on your brother and his wife.", "No problem, but I would contact SIL if I were you and apologise to keep the peace. I can see from her perspective that changing plans to be considerate of you would be a bit much and easier for you to stay home anxiety and health/safety wise. Maybe even sending a gift for your nephew even though you\u2019re no longer attending.", "OP was totally ridiculous and is without a doubt the bigger AH. However, the SIL just needed to refuse and not counter with more argument and drama. She also didn't need to involve more people into this BS.\n\nIt's her family the SIL can do whatever she wants, why bother arguing with the crazy pregnant woman like OP. I should have made my point clearer that OP is a massive AH and the SIL is just not reacting well. However this interaction could be pretty much avoided if SIL could just decline and move on - ignoring OP and not taking that much offense from that idiotic request.", "Just guessing but maybe they think the SIL could have responded better? Idk I think everyone could have handled it better. Hell if she wants to see her nephew so badly she could have asked if they come visit them when there isn\u2019t a party or something.

I would just fold rather then stand up for myself and say no. \n\nMy family didn\u2019t like that and kept saying comments like how she changed me. She definitely changed me but for the better and they just didn\u2019t like it since I wasn\u2019t just folding to their desires anymore. Now I\u2019m LC since they rare passive aggressive toward my wife. \n\nOP is definitely YTA", "And apparently in her brother and SIL\u2019s relationship. Internalized misogyny is a hell of a drug.", "I mean that is possible. My partner missed the birth of our second because he was 1hr40 min away. And my son arrived in 1hr20min. \nBut still I think OP is The AH", "Right! She sounds insufferable either way.", "I don\u2019t.", "With 4 little gobli-Angels.\n\nPlus odds are she\u2019s still gonna have to take care of all 4 kids, and her 2 oldest can\u2019t just head to their rooms or out with friends when they get bored (because they will) so she\u2019ll have to handle them too.\n\nAnd personally, taking care of 4 children would be exhausting. Odds are the mom also would enjoy just dropping unconscious in her own home the second the last guest left.", "I wholeheartedly agree. Send a gift and apologize. And get a grip on your misogynistic \u201cpants wearing\u201d POV. You getting 1 reply from a very kind stranger doesn\u2019t excuse the rest of your behaviour.", "I sense SIL has had to deal with OP's sense of entitlement before, hence the reaction.", "Respectfully, I disagree. OP sounds like a terrible SIL with the comments about their relationship, etc. It doesn't even occur to OP how many people are put out because she doesn't get her way. I've had a similar experience in my past where an ex would roll over for all her family because they were like OP (selfish). It ended our relationship. Good on SIL for sticking up to OP trying to guilt her into changing the party to accommodate 1 person.", "That's fair. \n\nThanks", "Her comments are very entitled coughcough", ">With 4 little gobli-Angels.\n\nI like how you caught yourself there lol", "Very true that is a possibility"]}
