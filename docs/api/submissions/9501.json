Depending on your coworker's age she could have been jailbait for him.", "NTA that is super odd behavior to just choose to lie about absolutely everything", "NTA - Depending on age of consent in your state, her lies were putting others at real risk. And you did nothing but find the truth.", "NTA", "Nta", "ESH- she sucks because she lies, she quit because of the consequences of her lying. Totally understandable why you\u2019d be suspicious and why you\u2019d engage in conversations with co-workers to piece together the truth. People who lie for no reason baffle me and it\u2019s easy to get sucked into their self-created drama. When you figure out she is a liar, stop digging for more clues. The part where you cross-over, to me, is when you say \u201cwith some more digging, we found out\u2026\u201d when you use the word \u201cwe\u201d you just made her an outsider. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if you talk to friends outside of work, or share with a partner, and not mention who the person is that has you perplexed, it\u2019s another to engage in gossip about her in the workplace. Granted the gossip is because of her own doing, but it\u2019s the added digging and investment in getting to the bottom of her lies on your part that makes you suck too. You can\u2019t pretend it isn\u2019t entertaining when you put forth the effort to do a deep dive into fact-checking. The big reveals are fun and probably made everyone laugh at her expense when you found out something new. It\u2019s a herd mentality. Maybe you didn\u2019t directly bully her in your mind, but gossiping is bullying. Digging for clues collectively places someone with a mental illness as an outsider from the group, when she is probably lying because she already feels like an outsider. It isn\u2019t your job or responsibility to \u201creveal\u201d anything. \n\nWhat you should have done? Kept your distance from her and stayed out of her business unless she is doing something to directly harm you (which doesn\u2019t include lying about her age unless you are paying her wages). You can\u2019t push the snowball down the hill then act innocent when it turns into an avalanche. If you are digging with other people, and talking to them, you are also culpable. \n\nYou also could have just spoken to her directly and maturely, being the older person. You could have asked her about her change in stories and reassured her that people would accept her without needing to lie or embellish. That puts the ball back in her court.", "Something I learned in this here subreddit: The light is never to blame for the roaches in the pantry.", "Or at least, be better at lying.", "They have hired people under 18 before. People under 18 just can't serve or bar tend. Her job was to be a hostess, so she pretty much just seated guests.", "By we, I meant the people I was originally talking to about it. If she was there I definitely would have discussed it with her first. I do agree I probably got overly invested in the situation. I do feel bad about how big it got and have thought about reaching out. I feel as though reaching out may make it worse. Like I said in my post after that initial day when my coworkers and I found the information, I dropped it and did not discuss it with anyone else at my job.", "I mean, yes, gossip is bad, but is this gossip or substantive information her co-workers should have? She's not lying about her crush or her weight or something relevant only to her. She's lying about whether or not she is a minor. \n\nAnd they work in a restaurant - in all but (I think) 2 states, she is too young to serve alcohol at 17, but in many, 18 is ok. Do her co-workers know that, or are they helping her break the liquor laws and endanger all their jobs? What other state labor laws might she be running afoul of by lying about her age?", "wow, i love this.", "I don\u2019t think you are an AH, I just said it sucks that digging for info turned into entertainment. I say this as someone who has done it, didn\u2019t feel good about myself after, and can see how easily it is to forget a human being with issues is on the receiving end. Once you share info you relinquished control over how it\u2019s used/abused. I would let it be and not reach out to her. She is the AH for lying to everyone and creating drama, just don\u2019t be the oxygen for the fire next time.", "Yes although her and I's job is hosting occasionally we are asked to run drinks or food when the restaurant is busy. I am not sure if she ever ran drinks or not.", "You can be a hostess at 17. If the concern is for safety and her being a minor, then tell the hiring manager, not the waitstaff while they are huddled around a hostess station looking up what school she really goes to. The liability is with the restaurant, not the staff. The restaurant gets sued, not the co-workers. \n\nEdit to add: the \u201cwe\u201d doesn\u2019t need to get into the debate about her age. One person goes to the manager and says \u201cmaybe you should check this hostess\u2019s age for your own liability.\u201d It\u2019s management\u2019s job.", "\ud83d\ude02 NTA everyone\u2019s better off without having that bullshit around at work she exposed herself because she couldn\u2019t remember her lies.", "NTA", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t lie, there was no reason to", "NTA. I've met a girl just like this Sadie. She was constantly lying and her lies would change from one day to the other. It was odd. Now that you've told me of someone just like her, I wonder if that's a diagnosable mental problem.", "I remember that one. Can you imagine what the daughter dealt with growing up? Yikes...", "That was my question. Do employers in the US not require to see at the very least your ID when hiring?", "that's such a spot on analogy. Love it.\n\nNTA. She's 17. I don't know about the laws of the place OP is in- but by lying about her age she can get her employer (and partner) in serious trouble.", "yea how did her boss knowingly allow a minor to date an adult man? Statutory rape is still statutory rape by law even if a minor lied about their age"]}
