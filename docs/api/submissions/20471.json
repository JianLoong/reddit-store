But a lot of them were helpful, my ex was determined to go to the wedding, despite my protests and even planned out how she was going to be refusing alcohol when offered. I did tell my ex\u2019s parents about what she was planning on doing. I didn\u2019t want to tell the groom or bride because I wouldn\u2019t know how to put it in words that would make the whole situation any less awful. Ex\u2019s parents did end up telling the bride's parents and then they told the bride.\n\nThe bride was so upset that she, unfortunately, called off the wedding. Everyone wanted her to continue it and invite my ex for a couple of plans guests thought of (ex: when my ex announced it everyone would just stay nonchalant and not give her the excited reaction she was hoping for, and the classic just don't invite her plan. \n\nThe bride was just understandably wanted to be left alone and she just texted my fiancee a very long paragraph telling her what a horrible person she was. She just decided not to do the wedding anymore, and her fianc\u00e9 was very heartbroken, but all in all, they were both grateful to me. My ex instantly knew that I was \u2018the cause\u2019 of all of this and she was furious at me, even more, because I posted about it here, but also said a pretty sick thing about how she still pretty much \u2018won\u2019 anyways. I just decided to break up with her myself after that.\n\nSome of her family members are kinda upset with me, as they believed I just caused a bunch of drama. Now I'm currently in the works of talking to an attorney as my ex told me I will not be seeing the baby after they're born. So all that on top of grief, working, breakup, being called a \u2018mess starter\u2019 by some of her family, and still feeling like shit because either way the bride and groom were heartbroken. It's just putting a bunch of anxiety and stress on me lol. Anyways here is the long-awaited update. Any questions, I\u2019ll answer.\n\n\nEdit: So they were pretty much already contemplating on canceling the wedding. Family members did stress her out over her miscarriage and canceling. Her fiance's family were excessive about she couldn't carry a baby to full term like a real woman. Not to mention her own family went around spreading her miscarriage like wildfire which is how my ex and I found out. They told it to co-workers even. It's not the first time my ex has also interrupted her cousin's big events (ex: when turning 17, my ex cake-smashed her, which wasn't fun for her cousin) their first pregnancy announcement(which was the miscarriage) was ruined because my ex blurted the news out, but her cousins told to get over that because it was a miscarriage anyways, so she's told by family members\n\nThis is what I was told when asking her fiance. So she's been at a breaking point for a while. She was considering just still continuing the wedding but wanted to be left alone. They didn't call off the wedding permanently, just until the bride has cooled herself down.", "created_utc": 1687620422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hvri2/update_aita_for_calling_my_fianc\u00e9e_selfish_for/", "score": 4446, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\n\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.

It's not very comforting, but it's something. it's really unfortunate that you didn't find out about your ex before you tied yourself to her with a child because she is not going to make it easy. Keep doing the right thing, and good luck with the forthcoming munchkin, they're amazing at refocusing your priorities.", "How sad for her cousin, I hate that she let your horrible ex ruin what should have been a special day. Honestly, the fact that your ex says she \u201cwon anyway\u201d shows that it was never actually about wanting to announce the pregnancy, just about hurting her cousin for some reason.

I feel terrible for her cousin, but if your ex had gone through with the plan, it would have devastated what was supposed to be one of her happiest memories.\n\nAs for your wife's family, they are right that you caused some drama, but doing so prevented even greater drama - in some ways you fell on your own sword. To the extent that makes you an AH (very little, IMO) it was 100% justifiable.

I'm very proud of you that you took the steps necessary to thwart her nasty plan. \n\nIt's a shame that some of her relatives are blaming you for 'causing' drama when *she* was the cause and your actions actually mitigated it. Although, I suppose now we have better insight into why your ex thought she'd get away with it: she's had family members all along who have taken her \"side\" in her cruel competition with her cousin.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not surprised that she continued to show a toxic attitude and you were forced to end the relationship. I'm glad you are talking to a lawyer about your child... I'm sure your ex will make it difficult, but that's all the more reason your child will need you to be a stable father", "Is your ex okay? Did she have like a meltdown or something? This all seems so weird", "She can\u2019t keep your baby from you. Don\u2019t let her", "Oof.\n\nNobody won here.

Definitely fight for full custody if you can, and make sure that the baby is yours. I wish you well.\n\nEdited to add: Reading your edit, I understand why they canceled the wedding. It\u2019s definitely not your fault. You saved the cousin from even more anguish!", "You did the right thing.", "Your hand was forced, so I would say you didn't cause a bunch of drama.

I'm guessing you didn't realize your ex was so terrible.", "I'm really so sorry man, this is ridiculously hard to go through I can't even imagine. I'm confused as to how she is acting, it really makes no sense to me at all. You have been both brave and honorable and are going through hell for it, all the worse with a child and custody issues on the way. \n\nRemember that with time things will get better than they are right now. All storms run their course and die out. If you need to talk feel free to reach out. I think breaking up has saved you even more grief and misery in the long run, just keep it up and lean on friends and family. Best of luck", "Honestly, I think you did the right thing even if it's making your life incredibly difficult. You basically saw the horrid disgusting wretched part of your ex that she likely kept secret, the part that is spiteful and mean. She \"won\" against her cousin by getting pregnant and ruining a wedding before it happened, and straight up acknowledged this. This is gonna be the mother of your child, and she's already decided to be a high combat ex.\n\nI encourage you to persevere legally, but expect her to lie her ass off in court and the judges to act ambivalent about this. Expect her to drag her heels and do everything she can even illegally to get her way. You are going to have to advocate for yourself in every instance, and it would be wise not to think for a moment you're being an asshole for demanding your rights as a father be acknowledged.

She is throwing a hissy fit and a temper tantrum because she didn't get to ruin the wedding and make it all about her. No judge is going to deny you access to your child because you told someone what she was planning.\n\nMake sure you have anything and everything documented. Good luck OP enjoy your little one.", "Wow you dodged a missile sized bullet. Get an attorney, child custody, child support, get everything in writing because she will use this child against you and will use the child to manipulate you. I'm sorry OP. I hope you find happiness", "You did the right thing by preventing the wrong thing. What the bride and the fiancee think is way more important than the selfish opinions of their family. The family are not very smart people - opposite, actually - if they don't see how the current drama is way better than the worse trauma you prevented.\n\nIt's almost like the family just can't take responsibility for the drama junkie they enabled, so they lash out at the person who actually does something about it. Good for you. Wear their hatred like a badge of honor. Pitiful people.", "You did what was right and if the haters get to much block them on everything and stick with the people that support you and besides even if u didn't tell them the wedding would have been ruined anyway because of said ex. so good jod to u \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "So sorry for what happened, but at the same time, yea.

To mitigate the associated drama, they asked permission to let everyone know during the reception, after the usual wedding-associated stuff was out of the way.). Your ex's decision to spring this on everyone *during* the now-canceled event makes her the AH and you NTA. While it's sad that the bride canceled everything, I'm glad you gave her parents a heads up and I'm sure the bride and groom felt the same way, even if the wedding got canceled.", "I'm sorry you and ex's family went through all of this. It appears that your ex is extremely vindictive. Actually, she's just flat out mean. You dodged a bullet there. Be prepared, though.

I'm sorry for your child already, and you too.", "Sounds like the cousin is a bit off to cancel her wedding instead of just uninvited your ex.

I\u2019ve also seen some lawyers with YouTube presences who focus specifically on custody cases with narcissistic parents, that will likely be invaluable to look into as well.\n\nAlso, as you process the breakup, you will start to feel the devastating fallout from this brand of emotional abuse.

A trauma-focused therapist, preferably one with narcissistic abuse experience, will help you SO MUCH in processing, validating the severity of what you\u2019ve been through, and helping you grieve so you can heal to fight for your child and prevent yourself from ending up with someone like this in the future (deeply empathetic people like you tend to attract narcissists accidentally and it\u2019s difficult to stop attracting this kind of person without the help of a therapist to help you establish better boundaries and identify your relational patterns). \n\nEMDR would also help a lot as you process what you\u2019ve been through.
