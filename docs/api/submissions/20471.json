But a lot of them were helpful, my ex was determined to go to the wedding, despite my protests and even planned out how she was going to be refusing alcohol when offered. I did tell my ex\u2019s parents about what she was planning on doing. I didn\u2019t want to tell the groom or bride because I wouldn\u2019t know how to put it in words that would make the whole situation any less awful. Ex\u2019s parents did end up telling the bride's parents and then they told the bride.\n\nThe bride was so upset that she, unfortunately, called off the wedding. Everyone wanted her to continue it and invite my ex for a couple of plans guests thought of (ex: when my ex announced it everyone would just stay nonchalant and not give her the excited reaction she was hoping for, and the classic just don't invite her plan. \n\nThe bride was just understandably wanted to be left alone and she just texted my fiancee a very long paragraph telling her what a horrible person she was. She just decided not to do the wedding anymore, and her fianc\u00e9 was very heartbroken, but all in all, they were both grateful to me. My ex instantly knew that I was \u2018the cause\u2019 of all of this and she was furious at me, even more, because I posted about it here, but also said a pretty sick thing about how she still pretty much \u2018won\u2019 anyways. I just decided to break up with her myself after that.\n\nSome of her family members are kinda upset with me, as they believed I just caused a bunch of drama. Now I'm currently in the works of talking to an attorney as my ex told me I will not be seeing the baby after they're born. So all that on top of grief, working, breakup, being called a \u2018mess starter\u2019 by some of her family, and still feeling like shit because either way the bride and groom were heartbroken. It's just putting a bunch of anxiety and stress on me lol. Anyways here is the long-awaited update. Any questions, I\u2019ll answer.", "created_utc": 1687620422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hvri2/update_aita_for_calling_my_fianc\u00e9e_selfish_for/", "score": 217, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\n\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means. Calling someone a horrible person, even in agreement with the OP, is not being civil. Failure to follow Rule 1 will result in a ban.\n\nIf you need a minute to cool down, spend it by [looking at pictures of my cats](https://imgur.com/a/CCQhLCo)", "I\u2019m concerned about this baby. The timing of it almost makes it seem like your ex got pregnant just to show up her cousin. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting a lawyer early", "OMG, op, you did the right thing, which very often is also the hard thing. It's not very comforting, but it's something. it's really unfortunate that you didn't find out about your ex before you tied yourself to her with a child because she is not going to make it easy. Keep doing the right thing, and good luck with the forthcoming munchkin, they're amazing at refocusing your priorities.", "How sad for her cousin, I hate that she let your horrible ex ruin what should have been a special day. Honestly, the fact that your ex says she \u201cwon anyway\u201d shows that it was never actually about wanting to announce the pregnancy, just about hurting her cousin for some reason. Don\u2019t back down fighting for your rights to your child, I\u2019m very concerned about a person like that having sole custody over a living breathing human being.", "NTA\n\nYou did the honorable thing. Hold your head up and ignore/block the complainers.\n\nI hope you can get a lawyer to pursue custody rights and win 50% custody.", "I'd say you dodged a bullet but you still have to figure out to coparent with her for the next 18+ years.\n\nYou did the right thing, and it also showed you a really ugly side of your fiancee, one that you determined you can't live with any further. I feel terrible for her cousin, but if your ex had gone through with the plan, it would have devastated what was supposed to be one of her happiest memories.\n\nAs for your wife's family, they are right that you caused some drama, but doing so prevented even greater drama - in some ways you fell on your own sword. To the extent that makes you an AH (very little, IMO) it was 100% justifiable. Sounds like her parents understand your actions, and that is most important as they are your child's grandparents.\n\nGet that lawyer, fight like hell for your kid, and if you have any inkling of doubt, make sure it's your kid first.", "I remember reading this when it was cross posted on bridezillas (as an example of a guestzilla). I'm very proud of you that you took the steps necessary to thwart her nasty plan. \n\nIt's a shame that some of her relatives are blaming you for 'causing' drama when *she* was the cause and your actions actually mitigated it. Although, I suppose now we have better insight into why your ex thought she'd get away with it: she's had family members all along who have taken her \"side\" in her cruel competition with her cousin.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not surprised that she continued to show a toxic attitude and you were forced to end the relationship. I'm glad you are talking to a lawyer about your child... I'm sure your ex will make it difficult, but that's all the more reason your child will need you to be a stable father", "Is your ex okay? Did she have like a meltdown or something? This all seems so weird", "She can\u2019t keep your baby from you. Don\u2019t let her", "Oof.\n\nNobody won here.  Except your ex because she got to stop her cousin's wedding.  \n\nI'm sorry for everyone else.", "NTA It\u2019s not your fault that they called off the wedding. That really confuses me, because all they had to do was disinvite her.  You did the right thing.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your ex is so horrible. Definitely fight for full custody if you can, and make sure that the baby is yours. I wish you well.", "You did the right thing.", "Your hand was forced, so I would say you didn't cause a bunch of drama. You tried to handle it without involving others and your ex was too busy being an AH.\n\nI hope you are healing from this. I'm guessing you didn't realize your ex was so terrible.", "I'm really so sorry man, this is ridiculously hard to go through I can't even imagine. I'm confused as to how she is acting, it really makes no sense to me at all. You have been both brave and honorable and are going through hell for it, all the worse with a child and custody issues on the way. \n\nRemember that with time things will get better than they are right now. All storms run their course and die out. If you need to talk feel free to reach out. I think breaking up has saved you even more grief and misery in the long run, just keep it up and lean on friends and family. Best of luck", "Honestly, I think you did the right thing even if it's making your life incredibly difficult. You basically saw the horrid disgusting wretched part of your ex that she likely kept secret, the part that is spiteful and mean. She \"won\" against her cousin by getting pregnant and ruining a wedding before it happened, and straight up acknowledged this. This is gonna be the mother of your child, and she's already decided to be a high combat ex.\n\nI encourage you to persevere legally, but expect her to lie her ass off in court and the judges to act ambivalent about this. Expect her to drag her heels and do everything she can even illegally to get her way. You are going to have to advocate for yourself in every instance, and it would be wise not to think for a moment you're being an asshole for demanding your rights as a father be acknowledged. People tend to say that or imply it to discourage men from this, but you're not. You're the father here and have a right to push forward.\n\nNTA", "I hope you win at lest 50% custody, because she seems like an entitled brat who needs to growth up. NTA", "You did the right thing and I'm proud of you. And your ex definitely can't just decide you can't see your kid. Definitely go for 50/50 if not full custody. She is throwing a hissy fit and a temper tantrum because she didn't get to ruin the wedding and make it all about her. No judge is going to deny you access to your child because you told someone what she was planning.\n\nMake sure you have anything and everything documented. Good luck OP enjoy your little one.", "Wow you dodged a missile sized bullet. Get an attorney, child custody, child support, get everything in writing because she will use this child against you and will use the child to manipulate you. I'm sorry OP. I hope you find happiness", "You did the right thing by preventing the wrong thing. What the bride and the fiancee think is way more important than the selfish opinions of their family. The family are not very smart people - opposite, actually - if they don't see how the current drama is way better than the worse trauma you prevented.\n\nIt's almost like the family just can't take responsibility for the drama junkie they enabled, so they lash out at the person who actually does something about it. Good for you. Wear their hatred like a badge of honor. Pitiful people.", "You did what was right and if the haters get to much block them on everything and stick with the people that support you and besides even if u didn't tell them the wedding would have been ruined anyway because of said ex. so good jod to u \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "So sorry for what happened, but at the same time, yea. Unless the bride and groom are okay with it (which is what happened at my mom and stepdad's wedding-one of my aunts and uncles found out not long before that they were expecting their eldest and it would have come out anyway. To mitigate the associated drama, they asked permission to let everyone know during the reception, after the usual wedding-associated stuff was out of the way.). Your ex's decision to spring this on everyone *during* the now-canceled event makes her the AH and you NTA. While it's sad that the bride canceled everything, I'm glad you gave her parents a heads up and I'm sure the bride and groom felt the same way, even if the wedding got canceled.", "I'm sorry you and ex's family went through all of this. It appears that your ex is extremely vindictive. Actually, she's just flat out mean. You dodged a bullet there. Be prepared, though. You now face 18 years of her trying to turn your child against you, and very possibly succeeding. Be prepared for the lies about you to your child until she feels she won. I'm sorry for your child already, and you too.", "Sounds like the cousin is a bit off to cancel her wedding instead of just uninvited your ex.  LOL that whole family seems to have emotional health issues.   Hope you are able to work out a good custody agreement with your child.", "How is your cousin doing?", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through so much. You did the right thing. \n\nI\u2019m\nA petty Betty.. if I were your ex\u2019s cousin.. I would not have called off the wedding.. I\u2019d have had it anyway and been able to say I \u201cone upped\u201d my now single cousin! Seeing as your ex wanted to \u201cone up\u201d her cousin and ruin her wedding.. but that\u2019s me. \n\n\nI hope her cousin is ok and will have her wedding soon. \n\nAs for you\u2026 your ex can\u2019t use your child as a weapon to use against you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting a lawyer involved now. In fact, you\u2019re being generous in going for 50/50 because your ex sounds unstable anyway. But there goes the petty Betty in me again.. because I\u2019d go for full custody\u2026 just saying. \n\nBless you in your endeavors and I wish you nothing but the best. You did the right thing. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your grandfather as well.", "I hope you remember a few things during this difficult time. \n1) no matter how much gaslighting or manipulation  comes your way, you did the decent, honorable thing. Its not your fault, your ex is the one who decided to act  so heartless and selfishly. You just wouldn\u2019t go along with her schemes, good on you. \n2) You did the best you could in a difficult situation, don\u2019t doubt yourself or your choices. \n3) The baby is yours too, you have rights, and you deserve to be in your kids life. They\u2019ll need you too, you\u2019ll be a great parent.   \nBest of  wishes and luck to you", "I am glad you are getting a lawyer to establish your rights as a father.\n\nI am sorry for the loss of your GF.\n\nRight now, you seem to need a safe place to recover from the drama.\n\nFWIW, I think you did the right thing informing the parents who then informed the couple.", "Welcome to adulthood, OP. You think it's bad now? You've engaged the game on \"hard\" level. \n\nIt's too late to back out now and you're stuck. I don't feel sorry for you in the least. \n\nTry to be a father, or not. Don't boo-hoo about it.", "You wrote you broke up your cousin's wedding because your GF was pregnant?\n\nThat's unbelievable.\n\nETA: Pregnant trashy GF wants to trash cousin's wedding with an announcement. OP called off his wedding, right? Cousin called off her wedding, too. WTF do you people care so much whether I completely understand some stranger's pregnancy drama? Kid's gonna be a bastard and dad's just noping out. What's to understand? I've got the gist of it.", "I'm sorry that you were put in such an awful situation.\n\nThe pain that would have been caused was considerable and you have done the right thing. \n\nGood luck with your custody stuff.  \n\nTake care", "Yeah that was my theory when OP originally posted.", "The NTA are on his side", "You should at least get 50% custody but also talk to your lawyer about whether or not there are grounds to try for 100% custody. Not sure if there are, but it's worth asking the question.", "As conniving as the ex is, he should probably keep in mind the risk of her moving out of state before the baby is born to keep it from him. There's nothing he can do about it legally until the child is born but I'd hate for him to be blindsided if it happens.", ">\tAs for your wife\u2019s family, they are right that you caused some drama, but doing so prevented even greater drama \n\nLet's not misdirect, even if unintentionally, even a tiny bit of blame on OP for \"causing\" this drama. In the most literal, pedantic sense, sure, his decision triggered certain chain of events that could be called drama. But he would never have had to make that choice without his ex making her, quite frankly evil, plan to cause drama and hurt to cousin.", "No she didn\u2019t. She is upset because I broke up with her.", ">I'm sorry for everyone else.\n\nEspecially that baby she's having.  Poor kid is being born to a narcissist of a mother.", "Yeah I wasn\u2019t sure I was understanding it correctly. She called off her entire wedding because her cousin was going to announce her pregnancy? Why not just uninvite her?", "[removed]", "No. His fianc\u00e9 was going to announce her pregnancy at her cousins wedding who just had a miscarriage. And now is trying to keep his baby from him", "Dammit man read the original post", "Typo. Thanks for pointing it out.", "Are we sure she\u2019s even pregnant? If she\u2019s this vicious, cruel, and, frankly, unhinged, she might be the sort to be lying in the first place.", "Doesn't she know about the post? Don't give that cruel woman any ideas.", "Fair, I meant like before the breakup. Super weird situation, best of luck for you Op", "It sounds like the whole family has some mental health issues.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

WTF would do all that IRL? Super trash, that's who.\n\nETA: Extra judgements.", "Agreed and surprised this comment was this far down. Canceling the entire wedding is so dramatic IMO \n\nUninvite OP\u2019s ex and be done with it.", "I have an aunt and 2 sister who act just like OPs now ex. So ya I believe it.", "My condolences. Pick better people?", ">I have an aunt and 2 sisters\n\nWow you\u2019re right they should\u2019ve picked what sperm and egg cell they would spawn from better", "and how would you choose your aunt and sisters exactly?", "Seems to me OP picked badly and now wants an excuse to dip out, when he's gonna be a father.\n\nSorry, no. He doesn't have to be a father but he's not excused because he knocked up an entitled witch who would derail her cousin's wedding because she's pregnant.\n\nESH!", "Not being a husband is not the same as not being a father", "I know that. Tell OP, who's boo-hooing about how he wont see his kid.\n\nEverything about this post and OP pisses me off! Disingenuous, at best."]}
