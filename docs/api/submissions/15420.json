We live in North America, so this is a BIG trip.\n\nWe get to Athens. Night 1 we go to a bar, and there is a very cute bartender (CB). We\u2019re having fun. she\u2019s talking to a guy, good for her. CB starts hitting on me, good for me.\n\nWe are both very drunk. I go to the bathroom and when I come out she\u2019s gone. She texts me that she went to another bar. I ask her if she wants me to go, she says if you want, I\u2019ll let you know where. I pay for the tab (she left without paying) and am left with 10 \u20ac, but whatever she has money on her and that\u2019s never been a issue.\n\n25 min later she still hasn\u2019t told me where she is. With no money and nowhere to go, I return to the bar. CB says that if I can wait he\u2019ll take me home. As we leave, Amy texts that she wants to take 4 people back to the apt. Sure, I\u2019m on my way too.\n\nI arrive. Amy texts that she left the bar and is in a taxi, but he doesn\u2019t speak English. I have CB send the address in Greek. We call each other, she keeps saying she\u2019s safe but I can tell she\u2019s very drunk and frustrated. I tell her to hand the phone to the driver and he can speak with CB in Greek and explain how to get here. She never does.\n\nShe finally arrives. CB leaves and as soon as we\u2019re alone she tells me that she has an apt booked for that night and she\u2019s buying a flight for the next day. I try to talk to her, I ask her not to leave but all she says is I can\u2019t explain, it has nothing to do with you but I\u2019m leaving. I ask if the taxi did anything to her, she says no, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking. She packs her bags and she starts an argument, blaming me for not being there for her, telling me she\u2019s sorry our friendship ended this way, but there\u2019s nothing she can do. By then I am very angry and ask her to leave.\n\n10 min after she starts bombarding my phone saying she\u2019s sorry, that she wants to explain. I answer with \u201cWhat a coincidence that now you want to tell me what happened\u201d. She says she\u2019s really scared and needs my help because the taxi tried to kidnap her. I snap. I know that\u2019s not true because I was on the phone with her all the time, and this isn\u2019t the first time she makes up something like this. I stop answering and go to sleep.\n\nWhen I wake up I have more msgs from Amy saying she\u2019s sorry, she knows everything was her fault, and doesn\u2019t want to leave, could we get together and at least talk about what happens with the trip? I answer that I have nothing to discuss, she paid for her part of the trip and she\u2019s welcome to come if she wants, but other than sharing a room, I\u2019m traveling alone. All she answers is ok. I find out from a friend that she bought her plane ticket back.\n\nNow she\u2019s telling everyone what a horrible person I am, that I didn\u2019t care while she was getting kidnapped and that I probably got turned on by it (???).\n\nI\u2019m having a great time in Greece, but I\u2019m feeling guilty of refusing to talk to her, because in the end she did want to apologize.

Am I reading it right - she just left you in a bar when you went to the toilet...and then disappeared for a while until you met back at the apartment, and she won't say where she was or what she was doing?", "NTA why did she leave the minute you went to the bathroom? Wouldn\u2019t any rational person wait for you? That is the number 1 rule you never break as a female going out & drinking. You never leave your friend behind especially when in a strange city in a foreign country. She abandoned you & is trying to blame you for her dangerous decision. If CB wasn\u2019t a nice guy you would have been in a dangerous situation too. She is a complete AH and needs therapy.", "NTA, who the fuck leaves their group when in a foreign country? That\u2019s idiotic on her part, double so that she tried to blame you for it. It\u2019s good you\u2019re distancing yourself from your friend, she lacks accountability for herself.", "NTA. It sounds like she's a drama queen. You don't need someone like that in your life. If you lose other friends because of her, then they weren't really your friends to begin with.", "NTA! She sounds unhinged. And she drew you into her drama. You\u2019re better off not having a toxic mess like her in your life. The \u2018friends\u2019 who believe her can also be put in your rear view mirror. Rejoice as they all get smaller and smaller and smaller.", "NTA - she sounds exhausting. I'm with Foreign Legion  dude below, this is drama no one needs and behaviour a child would understand not to copy. There aren't the words or the crayons for your former BFF, enjoy a less stressful life without her.", "Gosh she has issues, nta", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur not having money on you is your own fault. Not her drama.\n\nHer lies and her acting out make HER an AH. Much better not to spend yaour time with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was telling me that she was with 4 other people and that the club they were in was okay and they were nice, but she never sent me the name of the place or her location (we both had international data plans, so it wasn\u2019t a matter of not having means to communicate). Eventually, when I was heading back to the apartment, she told me that she and the people she was with wanted to go back to the apartment too, to continue partying. I said fine, I\u2019ll see you there, but it was still at least another 30 min before she started texting that she was on her way alone, and all the taxi drama started happening.\n\nI hope this makes it a bit more clear, but to be honest it\u2019s also very confusing to me.", "Also,  she has a very poor sense of personal safety.   You don't just leave a friend in a bar w/o talking to them first. Best to travel alone rather than with someone who's clueless.", "Yeah, I honestly don\u2019t care what she says about me, the people that know me know who I am, mostly I\u2019m just sitting here baffled that there are some people actually believe that bs.", "But didn\u2019t OP run out of money because she was stuck paying for both bills? At least that\u2019s what I got.", "The only thing here is that your mate is a Billy Bullshitter with behaviour that boarders on a personality disorder.\n\nVery, very strange behaviour indeed.\n\nThere's something going on with her but it's nothing to do with you.\n\nSorry your holiday is turning out to be a bit crap", "Is it possible she had some kind of mental break due to alcohol or drugs? Being blackout drunk can make you say and do crazy things. Since you say this isn\u2019t the first time, is it possibly some undiagnosed mental issue?\n\nEither way, it\u2019s not your problem to figure out. She ditched YOU and then got mad about it. I\u2019d leave this \u201cfriendship\u201d far behind.", "Actually,  her vacation may turn out even better now that she won't have to worry about her friend.", "It is. That\u2019s probably also what\u2019s making me feel guilty, that I\u2019m having a wonderful time and loving Greece!"]}
