{"id": 26163, "submission_id": "169abhz", "title": "AITA for asking for my bridesmaid to give me her gifts back?", "selftext": "I am a 30F and got married in Feb 2022. Two years prior we chose to have a destination wedding and asked our bridesmaid's and groomsmen if they were up for the trip. Everyone agreed 2 years was plenty of time to save up. Covid was a thing during this time and everyone was still on the same page once traveling opened up again. We planned a co-op bridal shower for November 2021 and all my bridesmaid's agreed to what they could contribute ahead of time. One bridesmaid in particular decided about 1am the night before our bridal shower to say she couldn't go. To my suprise the next morning I'm shocked because she was in charge of all the drinks (lemonade, tea, and soda) and we had over 100 guests. Now I will say she was known to  flake on plans but I didn't think she would on such an important day. I called her and in the end she confesses that she never bought the drinks to begin with. I'm pissed and had to get my mother to get everything that she couldn't. Well she shows up to the bridal shower and things go smoothly and she pays my mom back. Cool. I let it go. Since that was taken care of I proceed with plans and we all get together to make the wedding favors and I give all my girls there bridesmaid gift boxes. Then fast forward to the end of January 2022 and I get a message from the same bridesmaid that she can no longer go to our wedding. Again pissed off but find out she can't afford it anymore. Fine. I was furious because everything had already been paid for and ready to go. However I was able to tweak a few things and in place add another flower girl. The only thing I asked of her was to give me back the bridesmaid robe so my cousin could have one more in her size and the hair piece for the wedding so my new flower girl could wear it. And guess what. She said absolutely not because she doesn't give back gifts. I even told her to keep all the other gifts because they were for her personally and I only wanted the 2 items that are meant for the wedding party. But she pretty much said there was no way she would be doing that and that my fiance makes enough money that we can afford to but them again. Friendship completely over since then. I didn't think it was that bad of me to ask. So AITA?\n\nEdit: There is some confusion to clear up. My bridesmaid's did not fund my bridal shower. I did. I had them split up who would do drinks, party games,  and jenga between 5 girls. They all talked it out together and came to an agreement. Everything else came out of my own pocket. My wedding was known 2 years in advance that everyone invited would be paying there way to the wedding and I would not hold it against them if they could not go. That was the point of destination because I had over 100 people invited for the bridal shower (big family) and needed way less people to come to the wedding hence destination so less people would go. I asked multiple times to make sure everyone was still comfortable with going and by no means did anyone tell us no or they could not afford anything.", "created_utc": 1693779891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169abhz/aita_for_asking_for_my_bridesmaid_to_give_me_her/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those weren't 'gifts'. The bridesmaid thank you presents were gifts. The hairpiece and robe that are both to be used on the wedding day aren't gifts but part of the wedding party attire which she is no longer a part of and all because she is flaky and dishonest. She sounds like a bad friend. I would have been rethinking the  friendship from the bridal shower. The flaking out of the wedding last minute would have been the last straw, that's without even bringing the whole gift element into it. I hate inconsiderate people that you can't rely on.", "You don't invite people to a shower when they aren't invited to the wedding.   \nYou don't ask people for gifts back.   \nYTA, and a greedy one.", "I was going to say N T A until I read you were having your friends fund your bridal shower. And for 100 people! It's one thing to agree to go to a destination wedding and pay flight/hotel but your friends shouldn't have to pay for all the extras that you want. If you want all that you pay. She spent enough on you, she can keep what she wants, YTA", "NTA. The gifts were for BEING A BRIDESMAID not being a friend.  They are gifts for them standing for you, helping you, being there to do things, not them having a lottery winning on gifts. She should have offered to return the BRIDESMAIDS\u2019 gifts since she back out of being a BRIDESMAID.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tricky one, but if we're breaking it down, you're not the asshole for wanting the robe and the hairpiece back. Those were meant for participants in your wedding, and since she's no longer participating, it's fair to ask for them. She flaked on you multiple times, crucially at last minute, which causes real headaches for plans. \n\nOn the other hand, she's technically correct that gifts are gifts, but this isn't a normal situation. These items were given under specific circumstances. Her refusing to return them and then throwing your finances in your face is classless.\n\nSo no, you're not the asshole here. She is. And honestly, it sounds like you're better off without her in your wedding party\u2014or life.", "Why was she paying for your drinks etc? If she did then let her keep the gifts.", "100 people at a bridal shower?  That\u2019s insane. What a gift grab. \n\nAnd as for \u201ceveryone had 2 years to save up to attend my destination wedding.\u201d  Darling. If your friends don\u2019t have the discretionary income to buy these tickets and have to save for 2 years to do so, you are putting an undue burden on them and are not a very good friend.  The only way you can do a destination wedding is if it doesn\u2019t put out your loved ones financially. I bet your friends have student loans or other things they should be saving for, or maxing out 401ks, but noooo, you have to commandeer your destination wedding that they can\u2019t afford.", "ESH.  She shouldn't have committed and then flaked.  But when you use your friends as ATMs you have to expect a certain portion of people will drop out.", "YTA. Expecting people to shell out so much money on your behalf (she paid for the drinks?!) and still caring about this a solid year later. \n\nYour friend\u2019s finances turned out to be in worse shape than she thought they would be. I guarantee you that sucks more for her than it does for you. Grow up.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, weddings are out of control, and I'm not sure if people (especially brides) realize what a financial burden their friendship suddenly becomes to those they have invited to be involved.\n\nYes it sure \"special day\" but you have to remember that it's not a special day for anyone else.\n\nWhen I got married, my now wife and I made sure that it was not a financial or logistical burden for anyone else, at all. Bridesmaids, groomsmen, dinners and parties and trips and events and food and drinks and accommodations and such... no one was out a single nickel. I just think that's the right way to do it. \n\nIf you can't afford to fund it, then don't do it. Do what you CAN afford. Don't force friends and relatives to put a price tag on their relationship with you.", "YTA It was a gift. People are under no obligation to return a gift. You didn't have to give out robes and hair pieces, you chose to include them in your gift package.", "ESH. \n\nYes, she sucks for her behavior. However, she\u2019s also spent money in your wedding. And technically, she\u2019s not wrong. The gifts are hers. She doesn\u2019t have to give them back. Once a gift is given, it is theirs to do with as they see for. It\u2019s their personal property. \n\nThat being said, one can technically be right and still be an AH. \n\nYou suck though too. If you were going to ask for the gifts back, should you not have also offered to pay her back for the money she spent?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu would be fine to ask back for the present as soon as you have paid her back for the drinks she paid for.", "ESH You for having so much drama and complexity and oola laness for a wedding at other peoples expense and her for not being truthful about her finances until the 11th hour. Her also for not just giving you back all the presents and getting on with her life without you.", "YTA- gifts should never be expected to be returned, no matter what \n\nyou shouldnt have given things you want to be used in the wedding to your bridesmaids till the wedding day", "YTA.\n\n1. She did end up paying your mum back for the money spent on you/your drinks/your party.\n2. You not only asked for a *gift* to be returned, you thought it was appropriate to do so well over a *year* later. Why would you think your cousin or whomever would even want a robe that someone else used for over a year?!", "YTA\n\nSometimes you just have to let things go.  This seems petty.", "Info: you gave her her gift in November 2021 and waited until January of 2022 to ask for it back. Do I have that timeline correct?", "Well.... Was your friendship worth a robe?  Looks like you felt the friendship was worth max a couple hundred bucks.  Sounds like yta to me", "YTA, you should never ask for a gift back. I can see why you did but I think it's a bit harsh especially as she couldn't afford to attend in the end. She could have handled it much better and given you more notice but I still wouldn't have asked for the gift back", "NTA if these were items meant to be worn at the wedding, which she is no longer attending. Not sure what a bridesmaid \u201crobe\u201d is, but if you bought her bridesmaid dress and then she backed out the least she could do was return the dress to you. Same applies for a wedding hair piece. Is she planning on wearing these things on other occasions?", "Unfortunately YTA.  You can ask for gifts back I suppose (although it's a little tacky) but once she said no, it was no.\n\nSoft YTA because I think your friend is kind of a d\\*ck.\n\nGood news is that it's probably a relatively small price to pay to exit the relationship with her.  And she did pay your mom back for drinks at least!", "NTA. You weren't asking for person-specific gifts you gave her back, you were asking for the bride's maid-associated clothing/accessories. Bridesmaid's robes and hair pieces are both needed for uniform wedding pictures. If she isn't going then they should go to the person who takes her place. \n\nSay I propose to someone and give them an engagement ring. They decide later on that they don't want to get married. Is it their right to keep the ring since it was a gift?? I think most people would say they should give the ring back.", "Yta because asking people to spend money for your wedding is an asshole thing to do", "NTA, she decided not to be the bridesmaid, even if the money was related, she should return the gifts", "NTA but it's been a year and a half. Let it go. Not saying be friends with her again, but stop wasting brain space on it. \n\nshe flaked out last minute despite 2 years of advanced planning. She was a bad friend.

You had a destination wedding deliberately so you could exclude these extra guests, but you invite them to a big shower (partly paid for by your bridesmaids) because... they would give you lots of gifts? We don't do showers where I live, but I'm guessing that's what they're for? I've occasionally heard of people hosting a second reception at home after a destination wedding, but they always ask for no gifts.\n\nESH - the bridesmaid for not returning the gifts - clearly they were designated as photo props, rather than gifts, so holding onto them seems a bit petty. But YTA for the comment above. I have a feeling the bridesmaid would have a different perspective on this.", "They did not pay for the whole thing. I should have stated that. I made an edit.", "That's what my other bridesmaid's said too. They were all shocked.", "You\u2019d give her all of this stuff back a year later? Should OP pay back her bridesmaid for paying her mother back for the drinks?", "Everyone chipped in a certain amount for the bridal shower. It was something we all agreed upon prior. And no everyone was aware we could not pay for everyone's flights or room for the trip.", "She wanted to do it and was excited the whole time leading up to the day.", "I have been at bridal showers with over 100 people - some cultural, ethnic groups this is very much the norm and traditional so don\u2019t make a priori assumptions.", "Exactly\u2026. A gift grab.  This bride sounds entitled and exhausting.", "Well, the bridesmaid had plenty of time to back out and didn\u2019t until the last minute.  This is not the place for you to regale us all with your opinions about weddings.", "If the destination wedding is small nothing wrong with a large bridal shower", "They didn't have to. I didn't have any requirements other than to make sure you could commit to coming to the wedding. Everyone agreed what they could and could not do. Her finances were not the issue. All she had to do was let me know ahead of time. The point of having the destination wedding was to have less people attend the wedding. I had about 46 people for my wedding.", "Yea that's true. I would have been fine with that too.", "Agree. I wanted what I wanted and she did too.", "I realize that too. I thought it would have been easier traveling if everyone had there own stuff \ud83d\ude14", "She got the gift box November 2021 and told me January 2022 she could no longer attend.

But no I didn't think it was.", "Why would anyone want to be friends with someone who thought so little of them? (To be clear, in this case I'm referring to the bridesmaid thinking so little of OP.)", "They were \"gifts\" that were specifically intended to be used for the wedding itself.

Props that OP wanted to put to actual use for her wedding.", "She had actually posted pictures on Facebook wearing things meant for my wedding before my wedding date.", "Actually don\u2019t have to. Legal precedent for that. The ring is considered a gift and the receiver\u2019s to keep.", "An engagement ring is given contingent upon marriage. No marriage, the ring goes back to purchaser. The ring is a condition precedent to a marriage. No marriage, the condition precedent is unfulfilled & ring must be returned. Any court in the country (States) would rule it goes back to purchaser.", "Everyone invited to the bridal shower was also invited to the wedding. I had talked to family as well so it was a known fact that everyone was invited but most could only attend the bridal shower. So we made a big shower for everyone to celebrate locally  and a smaller wedding.", "In this case, the bridesmaid had committed to specific responsibilities that she failed to fulfill, twice over. Those wedding-related gifts were part of that commitment. I don't think OP needs to pay her back for the drinks; that was part of her obligation as a bridesmaid in the first place. The key items\u2014the robe and the hairpiece\u2014were for the wedding that she pulled out of. So if I were in OP's shoes, I'd still ask for those items back, even if some time had passed. It's about principles.", "Bridesmaids should never be paying for a BRIDAL SHOWER, either pay for it yourself or don\u2019t have one. This is the only part I struggle with because that\u2019s incredibly rude", "No, bridesmaids shouldn't be paying for your bridal shower for 100 people. That is a ridiculous ask on top of everything else.

By posting her story, the bride invited comments.", "You literally said it was because she could no longer afford it. \n\nAs for holding her to the commitment. Two years out.

It\u2019s on you to do so.", "Ignore above. Have whatever wedding you want. It's your life! Lol. It's up to others whether they want to partake or not. That's a given with destination weddings. My friend is having a destination wedding and I'm so excited for her and looking forward to it.", "I don't see you OP has creating drama. You organized yr events, paid a lot of money to have what you wanted & yr friend sucks. I'm  not seeing how you brought drama since it was yr \"friend\" who treated you like shit & you just moved on.", "It being a destination wedding makes even less sense that you would give it to them before the wedding day. At least one person is likely going to forget something.", "I\u2019d agree with you\u2026 had you given the items to all of these people in picture day or when they arrived at the destination. Why give those items so early? That doesn\u2019t even make sense to me.", "Why did you give the gifts so long before the wedding?", "Oh the horrors!", "Is there something seriously wrong w her you just never noticed before?  Bcz this is simply not normal.", "Legal and moral are not always the same thing. \nSure, legally you could keep the ring, but if you break off an engagement and keep the ring, unless there was major cheating/lying, then you are an AH.", "She stated elsewhere in the comments that she paid for the bridal shower out of her own pocket.", "Yea everyone does it different. That's what I'm doing for one of my other friends now actually lol", "Yea which is fine if she couldn't go. I told everyone from the beginning that if you can't go it's fine but just let me know in advance so I could plan accordingly.", "I mean I was honest and understanding with everyone. Some bridesmaid's couldn't do some things so I did it instead. No big deal \ud83e\udd37", "No I didn't because instead of talking it out she would rather point out how much money my husband magically has and i got mad. It was a big mess and caught me off guard.", "Thanks \ud83e\udd72", "I wouldn't have enough room in my suitcase for everyone's boxes. I thought I was doing the right thing by giving them early :(", "Apparently per my friends who had met her.

It\u2019s upsetting, yet. But you\u2019re not going to get it back. So who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong is irrelevant at this point.", "Yes. Communication was open the whole time. We even switched location to a state closer to us.", "Yea I did. I think I was just curious as to what random people looking in would think.
