We split the costs equally, gf was in charge of making reservations and scheduling. \n\nGf had trouble verifying a few things after the reservations were made which led to the following conversation/disagreement.\n\nGf: I keep calling the place and not getting an answer. I've left several messages over the past 2 weeks and I've heard nothing back.\n\nMe: are you sure they haven't called back and you just missed the call?\n\nGf: yes, I have the main number saved and any other numbers associated with the place.\n\nMe: well, did you try to call during office hours?\n\nGf: yes, of course, I did!\n\nMe: are you sure that you have the correct hours?\n\nGf: yes! I checked the hours on the website and google!\n\nMe: sometimes those hours can change and they're not immediately updated. You should call at 8am tomorrow morning.\n\nGf: I've already tried calling at 8am.\n\nMe: and what happened? \n\nGf: obviously I didn't get anyone to pick up. You're being so annoying right now.\n\nMe: how am I annoying you? I'm just trying to figure out why you can't get anyone at the place on the phone.\n\nGf: oh, so it's my fault now that the place isn't answering or responding to messages?\n\nMe: I didn't say that. OK, you said you left messages, right?\n\nGf: yes, I told you I left a message every time I called.\n\nMe: did you remember to leave your name and number?\n\nGf: what? Omg! Yes, of course I did. Why are you talking to me like I'm stupid?\n\nMe: I'm not talking to you like you're stupid. I'm sorry if you think I am. Did you leave them the correct call back number?\n\nGf: I've had this number for 12 years! I think I know my phone number by now. Just leave me alone, I'm sick of you talking down to me.\n\nMe: again, I am not talking down to you, and again, I'm sorry if you think I am. I'm trying to help you find a solution since you've obviously not been able to get things done.\n\nGf: whatever, handle it yourself, but don't say shit to me when you don't get a response either.\n(Convo ended)\n\nWe did end up getting a response  in person the day we checked in, but gf was a bit pissy the whole trip saying I owe her an apology for talking down to her, but I would have asked anybody those questions, not just gf so I don't feeI did anything wrong. Gf still says I was an absolute AH tho and still wants me to apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692723531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ybopv/aita_gf_says_i_talked_down_to_her_i_say_i_didnt/", "score": 1319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would immediately break up with someone who treated me this way.", "YTA\n\nYou were very condescending, and you didn't really offer any new suggestions.

If someone did that to you, I guarantee you'd be pissed off.", "Imagine you tried to get into your office tomorrow and the door was locked.

Let me explain because it seems like you aren\u2019t getting it.  \n\nYTA, dude. Every question you had was predicated on the assumption she must\u2019ve screwed up somehow.

It's not the person who you're speaking with, it's the person doing the speaking....you.  That's the common denominator in this equation.  You basically just showed your GF what you think of her efforts.  Get help, OP.", "YTA. And condescending. She already told you she called them several times and left messages in the first sentence.

I've left my call back name and number and have not heard anything!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut also, we make sure to ask if we are looking for solutions or to vent. your GF was not looking for solutions. she was looking to vent", "How could you type this whole thing out and not realize all your questioning says I believe my girlfriend is to incompetent to do any basic things on her own so I have to make sure she covers the basics before I can try to offer a good suggestion.

What does she want me to do with it?\" You can even ask her, \"Do you want to figure out the problem together?\" before you leap into problem-solving mode.

Teacher sheepishly says she must have accidentally unplugged it when moving it or maybe someone tripped over it. \n\nThis was not the first time someone called him for a \u201cbroken\u201d computer that was just unplugged. \ud83d\ude43", "I must say as someone who does tech support, we do this because you\u2019d be surprised how many people don\u2019t do basic troubleshooting steps.\n\nRecently had someone rudely call in saying they couldn\u2019t launch one of our applications and we must have changed something. I asked what error message they were receiving.\n\nThem: \u201cit says this application can only be opened in Microsoft Edge\u201d\n\nMe: I see, and are you using Edge right now?\n\nThem: \u201cI\u2019m on Chrome\u201d\n\nMe: Okay\u2026so have you tried using Edge?\n\nThem: \u201cNo, i\u2019ll try it right now\u201d\n\nAnnnd of course it worked on Edge. Wasn\u2019t a new update or anything either, this is how that application has worked since its inception. Some people are just not bright and/or kind of freak out the second they encounter something they don\u2019t expect and start calling. \n\nBut OP\u2019s bf is still TA, just adding to your comment haha.", "OMG!! YOU'RE RIGHT!!! \ud83e\udd2f", "LMAO exactly. \"Are you using the right password? Is caps lock on? Are you sure it's your computer?\" That's how awful he sounds.", "But but, he just asked. No need to get offended just because he accused her of doing things wrong / s", "I've been on the other end of that phone call, so that question doesn't bother me. The number of times I've told someone to restart their computer, and they just turned off their monitor and turned it back on. There is no way a home PC can restart in 3 seconds. Or had another tech ask me what they should do, and I ask if they had the customer power cycle their modem (nope!). Whenever I call support for anything,  I detail every thing I've done.", "Oh this so much\u2026 They leave it on you so they have no responsibility! The proper, genuine answer is\u2026 \u201coh, that sucks, let me know if you want me to try to get through somehow\u2026\u201d", "I've been married to my wife for 10 years. Last week I discovered I mix up her area code and the first three of her phone in my health insurance portal. \n\nSometimes you throw the fork in the trash and the trash in the silverware drawer.", "I was trying to lighthearted explain his mistake and let him know he's not the only guy that does it. It's really not that serious but the more we understand each other the easier it will be communicate effectively.", "\"That's annoying. Do you want me to try calling and see if I get through?\" \n\n2 sentences. One of you're a semicolon fan. That's all this entire issue needed.", "Yeah. So he's an asshole with everyone. Not better.", "If I had a friend, family member, or even boss act like this, there would be some major issues, much less a \"boy\"friend.", "\"I'm not being an AHole to my gf, I'm just an AHole to everyone so it should be fine!\"", "I lol'd when I read that, all he's saying is he's an asshole all the time, not just with her. Doesn't make you less of an asshole, bud.", "Lol I had an online \u201cchat\u201d with my cable provider today about re-pairing the remote for my home office\u2019s TV. I started the conversation with \u201c I\u2019ve rebooted the cable box and already tried the onscreen and online pairing instructions but nothing is working.\u201d Just had to get that out of the way right away lol.", "I was once the resident millenial in a public library staff team, so not exactly IT, but I did get kind of volunteered for a lot of the public computer issues. One person needed help on the computer and was struggling to explain why, and it turned out it was because she didn't understand how to use a mouse. It was actually kind of interesting in terms of saying something about different generations' experiences with types of technology, - she was quite elderly and had never really got into using computers, but her kids and grandkids had got her a tablet so she could keep in touch with them via videocall (which is pretty much identical to my Nan, including that we'd got her a tablet for the same reason, so I assume it's not too uncommon a pattern). She knew exactly how to use a touchscreen, she could navigate apps perfectly happily, but using internet explorer and google to get to the sites she wanted was difficult and she was just lost with the mouse because she'd never used them. Just found it kind of fascinating, because in my personal sort of mental history of technology, it was like she'd skipped a step. Made me reframe what I saw as universal basic intuitive knowlege.\n\nBut having said that OP is still TA obviously. The takeaway lesson if there is one, I think, is to be openminded about people's experience with stuff, not to assume that you're the only one who knows anything, or that people like your girlfriend - who's general life experience you're probably pretty aware of - can't handle basic interactions without your barely-disguised-criticism 'help'.", "It's true. I worked at a cable company, and ppl would call in trying to figure out their TV when there was a power outage.", "Haha! When I worked as a tech, I would often start off calls to support for myself with \"I am having this issue, and I have done X, Y, and Z. \"", "Haha that reminds me of the time where we asked if someone had really turned their computer off by plugging out the cable (we had reasons to believe it was a desktop). It turned out that she had a laptop \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Have you turned it off and on again?", "If you don't start the session with \"Does the building have power and is it not on fire?\".

I'm not convinced she understood, by the time I was done.\n\nI think my husband and son did that to me deliberately.", "It\u2019s just basic troubleshooting, that\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not an insult, nobody is testing your competence. Sometimes a restart does the trick.

If you can't get even get the other people on the line, how else are you supposed to tackle the issue?", "The difference is that tech support frequently DOES get people that haven't plugged it in, plugged it into itself, lost their password, dont know what a password is, etc.\n\nIts a little different.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying", "I do. My sister. She is so sure you screwed up because of your inferior thinking and ways  that she must show you her superior ability to do xyz. That kicks off the interrogation to identify your specific personal shortcomings. Arrrghhh....", "So, you are the person who got offended when I asked \"are you sure the cable is ported?\" and had 2 technicians sent to another country for 3 days to plug a cable in? Thank you, your employer paid for a lovely holiday and my new TV!", "Agreed. Technical Support's job is to investigate the issue and whether appropriate solutions have been attempted. OP has no claim to the same justification.", "I have a mother like this. She also interrogates you over your preparedness for things that could happen, however unlikely. Fun times.", "Omg.
