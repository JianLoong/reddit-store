The other girl is still in the hospital. So now you have at least some context for the proceeding.\n\nEmmy recently received an honour from our state government for academic achievement in Latin. Her friends decided to plan a party for her to celebrate and she asked if I (38F) would let her go out this one night and I said no. She's obviously upset but she's grounded, you don't get to just ignore your punishment because your friends are throwing you a party. I should also mention her punishment is *only* that she can't leave the house except to go to and from school. She still has her phone, her computer, her switch, her TV, etc.\n\nLater that night, discussing it with my fianc\u00e9 he said I was being a bit harsh on Emmy and that she's done her time and I should let her go out with her friends. I didn't budge, it's not a graduation or funeral. It's a party for something she can work for again next year. She's a sophomore, she still has two years before she graduates. That's two more years she'll have to go out with friends after she's learned that actions have consequences. She's not even thought to apologize to the other girls family or visit the hospital. As far as I'm concerned she's not learned her lesson yet.\n\nBut at the same time, it's just one night and it's for an academic achievement that she worked hard for.

And landing a friend in the hospital for over a month. \n\nShe is lucky she's not my kid.", "She's 15, got drunk, stole a golf cart, and put her friend in hospital because of it. Parties are the last thing she needs right now.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The fact that she hasn't figured out she should apologize is the kicker here. She might be good at latin, but the whole 'how do I get out of trouble' lesson is yet to be learned.", "NTA-finally some good parenting, momma. I have no idea why fianc\u00e9 thinks he even has a say. Is he her father? You have some things to make up for seeing as she steals and drinks at 15. \n\nYou didn\u2019t deny her an academic award. She still got that. Her friends (and your daughter) are trying to manipulating you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not falling for it. Of COURSE, they\u2019re going to plan a party to congratulate her for this award-it\u2019s the only way to get drunk again under the nose of the parents.", "So she and a friend gets drunk, steals a school's golf cart and crashes it into a pond. One person is hurt and in the hospital. Don't know where you live but if this happened in the states both would be charged with underage drinking, depends who was driving that person would be charge with a DUI. Charged with stealing school property she would be looking at huge fines plus juvenile jail. NTA", "NTA  -  If it was an official event thrown by the school then maybe she should go.  A party organised by her friends is the exact type of thing that being grounded stops you from going to. She broke the rules,  and in a pretty serious way,  she needs to learn that that has consequences, even if you do a seperate good thing it doesnt cancel out the effects of the rule breaking", "NTA. You're trying to discipline your child. If she can't even apologize to her friend who she put in the hospital, she hasn't learned her lesson. She has two more years of high school and college to party with friends.", "NTA.  It's actually an extremely light punishment.", "Why does she still have access to electronics if she\u2019s grounded? My mom always took away my phone, TV, iPod (back in the day), and going out as punishment. Her consequence, even for illegal action, is on the light side.", " NTA, she can still be stripped of the award.  She can still be charged with multiple crimes and have to serve time in a juvenile detention center.  If they prove she was the one driving, she might not get her driver's license for some time.   It could have been two funerals.  \nIf they got the booze from your home, you can be liable for the other girl's injuries. Do you know where she got the booze.  Was it from your fianc\u00e9 as he seems to blow this off?", "NTA considering the other girl is still hospitalized a MONTH after the crash, it had to have been pretty horrific, and I think you are right to maintain the grounding.  She doesn't get to go party just because her friends planned it.", "Nope.  NTA.  II think she is getting off pretty lightly because she still has her tv and switch.  Another person is still  in the hospital and she wants to go to a party?  Ummm...if I was her mother, that kid wouldn't be seeing tv or anything else until the end of this school year, where she would be getting a job to donate the money of the value of the golf cart.", "NTA. Unfortunately, my kids never had the *option* to ignore discipline and just go have fun. Soooooo, NTA.  Her friends are cracking me up thinking they somehow have influence in your household decisions, though? omg. Sit your kid behind down cuz grounded means no parties Miss Thing. Your fianc\u00e9s concept of discipline is just more lenient than yours. I don't think you're wrong or even overly harsh. (Plus she can celebrate when she's no longer grounded. The award won't turn to dust.)\n\nDrunk? Driving stolen school property? And crashing said property because of inebriation?   And your drunken partner in crime is *still* in the hospital? C'mon. Back in the day, I'd have needed a constable to protect me from my parents. No one would have said they were too strict either.", "NTA.

Probably best to not send the message \"If you steal and wreck a vehicle and cause bodily harm to people because you were drunk, you get a free pass for social parties.\" She should be lucky she's ONLY grounded and isn't facing charges for drunk driving, cuz depending on jurisdiction, golf carts do count as vehicles that one cannot legally operate while under the influence. Add underaged drinking and... yeah, she'd be smart to keep her head down after that debacle.", "NTA and honestly I would probably take some more privileges away to drive home the point. She could have landed in jail or killed her friend and herself. What she did warrants serious consequences as an adult, and should as a child as well. Her even asking that is such a blatant beacon that she does not understand the seriousness of her actions and that\u2019s the most important thing here. She didn\u2019t shop lift a candy bar, what she did could have gotten people killed. Like holy shit she needs a hard reality check for her own good, and a separation from the chance to do substances for a good long long while.", "NTA, actions have consequences. She's lucky she isn't in jail. Going to the party isn't going to be any good for her in the long run. You made the right decision.", ">that she's done her time and I should let her go out with her friends\n\nThat's *your* kid he's talking about. Not his.    \nAnd by the way, the friends can easily reschedule.   \nNTA.", "NTA.  She hasn't visited her friend at all?  That's pretty cold.", "No. She is in the FO stage of FAFO.  If you ease up know she won't learn.", "NTA I suggest taking away her TV and switch. Fun Entertainment like that are distractions from your responsibilities in life, at least that's what I experienced. Her focus needs to be on making amends to the school and her injured friend. \n\nThis is one of those situations that requires a serious conversation more than any type of punishment. Let her know that while she's 15, she shouldn't perpetuate the stereotype that teenagers are rebellious idiots who just care about drinking and having fun. You know she's smarter than that and that she's capable of making the right choices in life, and that what she did, while terrible, doesn't define her. Tell her she has a choice: Own up to her mistakes, start making amends, and prove to the world that she has both brains and heart. Or do nothing, in which case people will see that she's just a stupid, selfish teenager, her academic achievements be damned.", "NTA. getting drunk, stealing a golf cart, crashing it, and her friend getting hospitalized. what if a car had been more available than the golf cart? she and her friend could\u2019ve killed someone or themselves. at 15. good lord. she should consider herself lucky that she has a parent who still lets her have all those luxuries while still being grounded, because that wouldn\u2019t have flown while i was growing up. grounding doesn\u2019t just go away because she wants to go to a party, especially when she\u2019s being punished for something to that degree. the party is for her, so they can plan it at a later time. if you want to reward her for her achievement you can figure out what to do, like dinner or something. but you have every right to say no.", "NTA. If you let her go and it\u2019s a rerun of the last time you\u2019d never forgive yourself. You hit the nail when you said she\u2019s not learned anything if she hasn\u2019t asked to visit her friend. If she had and showed signs of emotional maturity then maybe I\u2019d say let her go, but she needs to realize drinking isn\u2019t a game. I only recently learned that alcohol can stay in the human system for 5 years. She doesn\u2019t need it until she understands it\u2019s not just for fun and that there are long term consequences to those kinds of decisions that don\u2019t just affect her. That \u201cfriend\u201d probably won\u2019t want her around if she doesn\u2019t show up for them, which may or may not be a good thing.", "NTA. I would say you could get her a small treat for the accomplishment. But like many have said here, it is a light punishment. If my two would do something like this, I would be making them do community service.  Look at crimes with community time and go from there. Not only will it teach a lesson, but she can also put college applications.", "NTA\n\n>The other girl is still in the hospital\n\nTell your daughter that her punishment ends when the other girl gets out of the hospital.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You never make a threat that you don't follow through on. Your daughter needs to understand she is paying the price for her actions. I think the friends were trying to to get her out of groundation. They can throw a party for her when it's over. Its apparent that your daughter doesn't understand (or doesn't want to) the purpose of her grounding. Maybe you need to explain it to her again. I would of been grounded for a year and not allowed to get my driver's license till I was 18. She doesn't realize lucky she is specially since her friend is still in the hospital.", "NTA at all - frankly I would explain to her that she will be grounded at least as long as her friend is in the hospital if she won\u2019t learn her lesson. Her friend likely can\u2019t leave the hospital for a night off- why should she be able to?", "The school didn't expel her for stealing their golf cart and crashing it?", "Right? Only being grounded and still having access to luxuries is a light af punishment.", "No joke.  Knowing my mom, if I had done that you would\u2019ve needed a oujia board to communicate with me.

What if they chose to be more sneaky if we punish them ?\n\nI always think actions should have consequences but I am also afraid that they might figure out how to not get caught and become a rebel. So I am not sure what to do - punish/have consequences or not and have a talk.\n\nTrying to learn :)", "It has been less than a month, bet charges are still coming.", "This is actually the concerning part. \nI understand the need for actions to have consequences and the importance of following through or being flexible on pushiments with extenuating circumstances, but OP - have you talked to your kid after the incident? Without the anger, but trying to understand where this behavior is coming from?\n\nDrinking, sure it's common, peer pressure bla bla. Stealing - definitely a very concerning escalation...\nBut not acknowledging that someone got seriously hurt? Lack of remorse? I'd focus there. She needs to get involved in purposeful/empathy developing activities or process whatever anger is hidden there.", "Because being extremely harsh actually isn't effective. Research has shown that children don't respond to overly harsh punishments.\n\nI'm trying to make her constantly feel FOMO. My plan is *much* more effective when she *has* her phone and she doesn't realise it.\n\nNow she gets the texts, she gets the pictures, the Snapchat stories, she sees her friends having fun in real time *and* then has to hear about their fun after at school.\n\nIt's a bit fucked up on my end tbh but she gotta learn somehow.", "Never mind. You're right. That's cold and its self involved and immature.", "No you take away entertainment when grades start slipping. You use psychological warfare otherwise. Why do you think she has her phone? Social media does like half my job for me if I remove her ability to leave the house. Let her see all the fun she *could* be having had she not made dumb choices.", "This is smart and something that can make her develop more empathy and maturity.", "My mother used to drop the hammer for really bad acts. One of my brothers punched our littlest brother. And he was grounded for the entire summer vacation. (I definitely thought mom was way harsh and she definitely didn't give a flip what I thought.)\n\nNeedless to say he has not hit anyone since then.", "It depends. 9/10 punishment is pointless and will solve nothing. Punishment should be reserved for major fuck ups. When they do get punished, you should start at minor discomfort. Just enough to subtly suggest \"shape up or I *can* make it worse.\"\n\nIf they continue our fail to show they've learned the lesson.... ratchet it up slowly like a boiling a frog.", "Her dad died six years ago and I'm remarrying. It's not hard to figure out where it's coming from. It's just not relevant to this discussion.", "I didn't even think of the fact that if she's physically grounded but can still see all the fun her friends are  having via social media....this is freaking brilliant. What a way make grounding work the way it was intended.  Very smart.", "How is she feeling FOMO when she still has access to her friends in other ways via her phone and computer? If she needs it for school, fine, but all apps she talks to her friends on should be locked. Grounded meant just that. If you weren\u2019t at school, you were at home. No calls no nothing. \n\nYour daughter was drinking at 15, seriously injured her friend, and feels no remorse. Why is she drinking? Who are these friends? Are they the bad influence or is she? \n\nThe situation could have been so much worse. She could be slapped with charges and face juvenile detention. Being so lightly punished isn\u2019t going to teach her much of a lesson at all. What will the punishment be when her behaviour escalates?", "That's fair.", "Them tax dollars at work.", "> how is she feeling FOMO?\n\nHer and her friends are not homebodies. She still their Snapchat stories, pictures they send in group chats, etc. They are having without her and she gets to see this.\n\nEdit: I could totally make this *worse* but I'm going to give her time to learn the lesson being lenient first.\n\n> Grounded meant just that\n\nYes, meant, past tense. Times change.\n\n> Your daughter was drinking at 15\n\nDid you not go to parties in high school? I was doing much worse than just drinking at her age. She'll be of drinking age in two-ish years after we move.\n\n> being so lightly punished isn't going to teach her a lesson\n\nEmpirically neither will punishing her more harshly. Grounding is, in point of fact, pretty much one of the least effective means of changing behaviour. It's incredibly ineffective when used incorrectly, and in all cases harsher punishments are less effective than more lenient ones.\n\nThis is also pretty well known in certain circles. It's literally something I got taught at work for handling uncooperative informants. Don't take anything away, just subtly influence their environment. No leaving the house, tempt them with promises of future gain, cut off the central cooling. If it's good enough for the military....", "OP, I'm totally with you on the level of punishment and the logic behind it, but I mentioned in another comment as well. \n\nWhat's going on behind the not going to visit or apologizing to the other girl? Does she believe the other girl is \"more at fault\"? Does she recognize her role in the indicent? Is she going to be doing anything to develop more empathy and acknowledge the level of risk they were in? \nHave you been able to have an honest conversation about this? Is there another adult trusted figure that has been able to get through to her in that sense? \nShe needs a wake-up call that will make her grow smart. You can have fun and take risks without making dumb decisions that put your life and other people's lives in danger. \n\n(I also was a wild child, and I'm grateful every day for the higher power that kept me from danger, so I mean this without judgment)", "Being in the hospital for a *month* at 15 sounds like she was pretty critically injured. Really strange to not visit as that would be an effective teaching moment as well, for both of them.", "I'm trying to to teach a lesson, not force her to go through the motions. It's meaningless if I force her to go.", "You force her to go, but you can't force her to feel some type of way. There are plenty of adults that want to avoid witnessing painful situations like that, but they don't get that luxury. She needs to see the consequences of her actions."]}
