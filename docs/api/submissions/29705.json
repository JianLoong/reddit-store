When I was younger an allergic reaction to a dog triggered an asthma attack and so now I\u2019m very wary of being in a closed space with dogs.\n\nThat\u2019s why when I saw this customer I asked if it would be ok for the dog to remain outside but I could possibly leave the door open. This is when the customer started shouting at me and calling me names saying I was discriminating against them. The customer said that it\u2019s a guide dog that has to be with them at all times and it\u2019s against the law for me to not allow the dog to enter.\n\nI offered for her to come another day where I could get my friend to cover the time she would be in the store (and then get everything deep cleaned after) but the customer wasn\u2019t ok with that since they wanted to browse \u2018right now\u2019.\n\nThroughout this conversation I could already feel slight symptoms coming along such as itchy eyes, nose and throat.\n\nThe customer shouted at me for a while which people passing could hear but no one intervened or helped. Eventually I just had to shut and lock the door so that they could not enter, and I closed up for the day. They\u2019ve now left a horrific review on my store saying that I discriminate against those with a disability. Should I have just sucked it up and let them into my shop?\n\nEDIT for info: I did politely explain to the customer my allergies and how severe it could potentially get but the customer did not seem to care. I do have doctors notes etc. for my allergy as I am on daily medication but the customer did not give me any chance to explain or show, just constant aggression.\nWhen I say suck it up I don\u2019t mean just bare with the slight discomfort I mean maybe I should have just let the customer and dog in with the hopes that my reaction will not be life threatening(of course I wouldn\u2019t know what could happen). \nIn terms of avoiding the situation, I have an air purifier and am on medication daily. I also deep clean very regularly, and whilst I may be uncomfortable sometimes I never directly come into contact with dogs nor am confined in a small space with them so no massive attack has happened yet due to my caution.\n\nMore info as seems some confusion in comments, I\u2019m not sure if the customer was blind or not - if I\u2019m being honest I wasn\u2019t paying all that much attention (my eyes, throat and nose weren\u2019t feeling great and I was hyper aware of the dog). In terms of not being able to show my paperwork, I wasn\u2019t actually planning on showing them any doctors notes as in most cases this is resolved by me politely explaining my allergy. However if it would have helped then certainly I would have (I keep this in my handbag at all times), but we didn\u2019t get this far in the conversation as the customer was just constantly berrating me after I told them of my allergy.", "created_utc": 1698309234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17grusw/aita_for_asking_a_customer_with_a_guide_dog_to/", "score": 1281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Asthma and allergies are not a joke. That dog could have put OP in the hospital if the asthma attack was bad enough.\n\nSo literally at what point does the line get drawn? Should OP have to let them in regardless and end up in a health crises? She did everything she could to accommodate that customer (which also makes me think nothing would come of a lawsuit). The customer could have shown some compassion themselves and worked with her. \n\nWhose health in this situation is more important? The person who will become physically ill? Or the person who can absolutely come back later with no adverse consequences ?", "NTA.  I would respond back to the review with this:\n\n\"When you came to my store the first thing I should have done was inform you that due to my severe, medically documented allergy to dogs that the dog would either need to stay outside, or you'd have to come back on a different day to browse.  I neglected to mention my allergies when I asked you to keep the dog outside, so that is on me.  However, when I tried to clarify my request was due to my allergies, you ignored me, belittled me and accused me of discriminating against you.  If you had actually been paying attention while you were verbally abusing me, you would have been able to *hear* that I was already reacting to your dog.  I wasn't discriminating against you I was trying to offer you a ***reasonable accommodation*** that would take both of our medical conditions into account.  Unfortunately, that meant you would have had to come back on a different day when another employee who isn't allergic to dogs would have been available.\"\n\nIf you are in the US I would add:\n\n\"The ADA recognizes my severe allergies to dogs as something that needs to be accommodated.  That means I can ask that all dogs, including service dogs, stay outside the store or offer the accommodation of you returning on a different day when another employee is available.  This does not give you the right to insult, berate or belittle me because I can't let you do something you want to do right now.\"", "NTA. \n\nI am not sure in which you country you live in, but in the United States this kind of issue is known as conflicting of accommodations or competing of accommodations.\n\nhttps://www.accessibility.com/blog/conflicting-accommodations-when-accommodations-are-not-compatible#:~:text=The%20Americans%20With%20Disabilities%20Act,undue%20hardship%E2%80%9D%20on%20the%20employer.\n\nMy suggestion is that you have a printed explanation of the situation behind your shop counter that explains the situation so you won't have to come up with the language off the top of your head if it happens again. The printed explanation can also have reasonable accommodations such as offering customers with service dogs an option like discussing the shops products over the phone.\n\nI would also draft a response to that review and then have someone else review it before posting the response online that includes your disability (severe pet allergy) and options to accommodate others.", "You should look up the law around it but personally I post on the door....\n\n\"Service animals only; permitted legally by appointment only due to SEVERE allergic reaction by owner will cause anaphylaxis \"\n\nThat way you're not \"denying entry\" simply putting it up front in writing they can come AFTER they make the apt to do so.", "NTA\n\nTheir need for accommodation for a medical condition does not supersede your own need for accommodation of a medical condition", "NTA. \n\nUnfortunately, disability requirements clashed here. I would consider talking with a lawyer (or consult the various legal subs here) to see if there's anything you can legally do incase of another situation like this, just so no legal trouble pops up. \n\nUntil then, maybe print out a large enough sign to put in a window or on the front door explaining the situation so people know that you aren't *trying* to be discriminatory in any way.\n\nAlso, if you can respond to the review at all, I would definitely clarify what happened and why. It would really suck if you lose customers because of an unfortunate situation.", "OP you are NTA. However, you need to address the bad reviews. Try to get them pulled by petitioning the review site. If that is unsuccessful, write a POLITE, FACTUAL, CONCISE explanation of what happened and what you offered as a reasonable concession.

However, OP also has a disability (if of course the allergic reaction to the dog can be as bad as they say). If it's OPs shop and OP cannot remove themselves from the situation, then there is absolutely no justification for one disability + guidedog weighing more than the other. OP offered solutions to mitigate the problem and got yelled at.", "Nta there are 2 legit medical concerns.

The customer was not physically harmed in any way by not being able to shop there (the shop sells souvenirs and trinkets, not basic necessities). OP was right to refuse them entrance, NTA.\n\nTo avoid such issues in future, maybe consider posting a sign outside? Schools and public venues sometimes have such notices to warn restrictions due to severe allergies.", "You are NTA. Imagine thinking a service dog is more important than a person's health in their own shop. That's disgusting. The entitlement of people who think their problems are always worse than others.", "NTA. Going off your post and comments, it sounds like you were pleasant and professional to this person. You didn\u2019t choose to have this allergy and you\u2019re doing your best.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't discriminating against them because of a disability, you were trying to protect yourself from a situation that could prove to be life threatening if you had a severe enough asthma attack.\n\nThe customer will not die if they can't look around your shop, you COULD die if they do. The customer is definitely an AH for putting browsing for trinkets above another person's life.", "NTA. Reply to the review and explain that the business has a legal obligation to accommodate their employee\u2019s serious allergies. As such, the dog was not able to come into the store as the staff member has a life threatening allergy to dogs. Remind the customer that you suggested two separate accommodations - to leave the dog outside during their shopping experience, or to come back another day when someone without those allergies would be available to assist. You should note that the offer to come back was extended even though it would have required the business to incur deep cleaning costs in order to make the space safe for the allergic staff member.\n\nThen say: instead of accepting one of the compromises, you instead became abusive. There is no requirement under the ADA to force employees to experience anaphylaxis. We are sorry you had a disappointing shopping experience but having a disability does not give you the right to scream at our staff. Please don\u2019t come back.\n\nIncidentally, my severely allergic relative handles this kind of situation with the use of a very serious mask. You could potentially look into acquiring one so that you have more options if this happens again.", "NTA - my Mum died from an asthma attack nearly 10 years ago. \n\nYou offered another day which is above and beyond, stay safe always.", "Post sign on door saying no dogs allowed due to severe allergies with phone number to arrange other accommodations.

Unfortunately I do now need to rescind that offer as we do not accept our personnel being verbally abused by customers. Or something along those lines.", "OP needs to consult with an expert on the local laws on service dogs and post a sign at the entrance of her shop about her allergies.

You did nothing wrong.", "Here's the thing about ADA-- and as a service dog owner she should know this. The law requires businesses to make reasonable accomodations where possible. Reasonable. It is not reasonable to expect someone with allergies so severe they can induce an asthma attack to stay in the room with a dog. This is the same reason that people could deny entry to those who couldn't wear masks for medical reasons during COVID. Because it produced an unreasonable risk to others. It's also unreasonable to expect the shop attendant to leave the shop unattended as well for obvious reasons.\n\nYou offered a reasonable solution, instead of just straight up saying she can't ever shop there.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Unfortunately, I do have a very serious allergy to dogs that is heightened by the fact that I have asthma. While I did try to explain this at the time, I can sympathize with how frustrating it must be to have access to places be limited already and I wish I had been able to come to a better conclusion with you for this scenario. My offer to have another employee come in to assist you on a day and time of your choosing still stands if you wish to reach out to me to do so.

A service dog can be so vital to their owner I know, but everyone\u2019s special needs should be taken into consideration in this instance. The person with the dog may receive a lot of pushback from people who are ignorant about service animals, so I can understand that they\u2019d be upset about not being allowed in. In this situation though you need to be accommodated.", "NTA So this person with a disability has no respect for your own \u201cdisability\u201d?

While the person who has a guide dog has disabilities, it seems like they have forgotten others can have them too. Or that some disabilities/diseases are not visible. It was so entitled on their end to put you at risk despite you notifying them you have an allergy.\n\nPlus the vicious review is so uncalled for. If it\u2019s Google, you can get them to remove it. You can also reply to the review temporarily to explain that you\u2019ve made alternatives and tried to accommodate. Also, I think you have every right to sue for defamation and possible loss of income.

Throw it right back at them.  The dog made you so sick you had to close for the remainder of the day to manage the symptoms.  \n\nI have a trained service dog.  The number one rules I follow is to not be an AH.  If a small business owner asks me nicely not to bring the dog in due to their own discomfort, I don\u2019t bring the dog in.

There are two things that are different in this case.\n\n1) In the case I explained above the shop owner ***knew*** this person required that dog. Admitted it straight off that they knew it was a service dog. Because they cannot ask why a person has this dog, though are allowed to ask what task it's trained to perform, you can't always know the reason someone has one. If they give the answer \"They're trained to alert me if I'm about to experience an episode\" they don't have to say what kind of episode. But that service dog is considered medical equipment. And by telling someone their medical equipment has to be away from them, leaving them without access if needed, is why I think it would make the shop owner 100% liable.\n\nIt's also not a **reasonable** accommodation to ask them to separate.

This is known as the shock position and it allows the body to get blood to the heart faster.  During shock your blood vessels actually constrict and get small and tight so the blood stops flowing and can be fatal. \n3) ask if they have an epi pen.  If they\u2019re unconscious look in their bag for one.  Check their wrists for a medical bracelet with info like a diagnosis and emergency contact #.  If you find an epi pen, it goes into the top part of the thigh just off center towards the outside of the leg (assuming they are laying flat.  If you forget the specifics just remember TOP).  Take the case off the epi pen.  There are 2 sides.  One is blue.  One is orange. \u201cBLUE TO THE SKY. ORANGE TO THE THIGH\u201d is the phrase to remember!  Orange side gets injected into the top of the thigh. Wrap your hand around it with both sides visible to be safe (in case you get the phrase wrong so you don\u2019t accidentally inject your hand.). Just take it and jab you don\u2019t need a ton of pressure maybe a 10-12\u201d and just lightly take your hand and then go down to the persons leg. It has an auto injector it does everything but jab them for you.  \n4) An epi pen is good for about 15 min of lifesaving epinephrine.  Assuming the ambulance has arrived by now (since you called them first!) your job is done.  If it isn\u2019t? Get a 2nd epi pen if they have one or someone else does and do step 3 again at the 15 min mark on the opposite thigh.  You\u2019ve bought yourself 30 min of lifesaving time to get this person into an ambulance or driven to an ER.  \n\nKey things to remember:\n1) call 912\n2) shock position \n3) epi-pen \n4) wait 15 min.

When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.\nA person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal\u2019s presence.\n\nI'm sorry,  but here's the law in question.  You can argue that it's not right or fair,  but it is the law.", "Because in the case of the plane, the person with the allergy is needing the extra accommodations, not the disabled person. The disabled person is allowed by law to get on a plane with a service dog, so that's not an accommodation. They are allowed to be there. If someone has an issue like an allergy, they can't just kick the disabled person off. It's up to the person with the allergy, they can either choose to ride, or not. \n\nAlso, people travel with dogs in the main cabin all the time and they don't clean planes in-between rides. There will always be a chance they will come into contact with pet dander. \n\nIf this wasn't the case, people with service dogs would be kicked out of places all the time, not able to function as a normal person because everyone else's accommodations would come before theirs. There's a reason why we have these laws in place to prevent discrimination.", "Even I know asthma can kill.", "I love it when people think retail workers should just suffer, or die, for others.", "\nOP HAS SEVERE ASTHMA AND A SEVERE ALLERGY. THE ALLERGY WILL TRIGGER AN ASTHMA ATTACK. THE SEVERITY COULD BE MILD OR SEVERE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE EMERGENCY MEDICAL ATTENTION. \nJust because you work with service dogs and know the laws by the book, doesn't mean you know OP's individual medical condition. OP attempted to make accomodations that would work for both of them, but the person with the service animal turned that option down & refused to discuss other alternate options.", "The ADA also explicitly states that allergies are not considered a direct threat.", "You stopped reading the document too early. Allergies are not considered a direct threat.", "Offering access without the guide dog is denying access to the store. \n\nThe issue here is that since there is no other worker anyone who needs a support animal is effectively banned from the store. That is problematic. I don\u2019t know the answer here, but it\u2019s also not ok to basically say that anyone who needs an animal for medical reasons can\u2019t shop there without an appointment.", "To begin with, an allergy is not usually a disability to begin with so the excluding question doesn't apply in the context of the ADA - they aren't usually severe and uncontrolled enough to qualify.  But for the hypothetical you posit (someone with a severe enough dog allergy that they cannot be around your dog for any period without a severe reaction), I think the rationale would apply equally to someone with a severe peanut allergy that lights up just from dust or scent walking into a restaurant where peanuts are served - I haven't studied the case law on where the line is drawn but I suspect you would not be required to yield a service animal to someone's allergy, see https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-2010-requirements/.   Among other things, it would basically completely gut the ADA's protection for service dogs for people to be able to exclude them based on claims of allergies since everyone and their mother could say that in order to bar SDs in the way OP is.", "Also just to add, a guide dog is not trained and certainly would not have the capacity to indicate to the owner whether or not there was signage which may need to be read.", "Thank you :)", "Right but statistically, what are the chances that every single disabled person in every single conflict on here is an absolute psycho? It strains credulity.", "Even if it was, the person with a guide dog is still an asshole. Allergies can really fuck people up. OP asked politely, the woman could have just respected that OP likes to be able to breath and left. There was no need to leave a nastygram claiming she was being discriminated against because OP had the audacity to try and prevent a severe allergic reaction.", "You need to read the rest of the link:\n\n\"Q25. When can service animals be excluded?\r  \nA. The ADA does not require covered entities to modify policies, practices, or procedures if it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public.  Nor does it overrule legitimate safety requirements.  If admitting service animals would fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program, service animals may be prohibited.  In addition, if a particular service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, or if it is not housebroken, that animal may be excluded.\r  \n\r  \nQ26. When might a service dog's presence fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program provided to the public?\r  \nA. In most settings, the presence of a service animal will not result in a fundamental alteration.  However, there are some exceptions.  **For example, at a boarding school, service animals could be restricted from a specific area of a dormitory reserved specifically for students with allergies to dog dander**.  At a zoo, service animals can be restricted from areas where the animals on display are the natural prey or natural predators of dogs, where the presence of a dog would be disruptive, causing the displayed animals to behave aggressively or become agitated.  They cannot be restricted from other areas of the zoo.\n\nLast updated: February 28, 2020\"\n\n[https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/](https://www.ada.gov/resources/service-animals-faqs/) \n\nI have an allergy to dogs and was in a similar situation at my place of employment (I have undergone immunotherapy, so I don't react as severely to dogs however, if certain breeds lick me (the so called \"hypoallergenic dogs\"), I break out in hives.  The handler allowed their dog to lick me because that's how the dog was trained to alert, and she and I shared a similar medical issue.  She refused to keep her damn dog away from me or train it to alert another way).  Since both of us couldn't be accommodated, the decision was made to exclude the service dog since I had seniority over the service dog handler.  The handler filed a complaint with the EEOC, and they sided with me and my employer and found *no violation* because trying to accommodate both of us created an undue burden on my employer.", "Umm I never said asthma can\u2019t kill? Just pointed out that while symptoms of the two conditions may be similar, medically speaking they are different things", "MAYBE it's just me, but I'm like 99.99% sure that DYING is a direct threat.", "She doesn't just have allergies. She has severe asthma that can be triggered by her allergies. Asthma can be life threatening.", "OP has a history of asthma connected to exposure to dog.  She also says she has a severe allergy.\n\nPeople die from asthma, including asthma caused by allergic triggers, sometimes when they have otherwise never had asthma or only mild asthma.  So why would allergies be excluded and not count as \"significant risk of substantial harm\" in at least some cases?  \n\n\nNow, we don't know how badly OP's asthma would trigger from exposure to a dog, but you generally don't categorize something as a severe allergy unless it has a pretty big impact on you.  \n\n\"Direct Threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. The determination that an individual poses a \u201cdirect threat\u201d shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. This assessment shall be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include:(1) The duration of the risk;(2) The nature and severity of the potential harm;(3) The likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and(4) The imminence of the potential harm.\"  (source [https://www.govinfo.gov/](https://www.govinfo.gov/))", "But given that OP\u2019s allergy did have the potential to cause her to go to the emergency room if she had allowed this person to browse, I think there needed to be some room for flexibility. Maybe that\u2019s the person staying outside and asking for a specific product, or making that appointment. But I don\u2019t feel that as a service dog handler, my right to access trumps OP\u2019s right to avoid a life threatening issue. And the fact that the handler was immediately combative and unwilling to find a middle ground suggests that they are at least partially in asshole territory. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a case of \u201cyou can only sit in the patio area because we don\u2019t want you inside\u201d or \u201cwe suddenly have no hotel rooms because you have a dog\u201d.

In your case, the handler did not have control of the animal, and it was a behavior that caused the issue.  You are also in employment laws area,  and this is about public access laws.  This business is not a residential facility,  nor an animal care facility.  They had to exclude allergies because it was a golden ticket to exclude those who needed service dogs and people abused it.  I feel that in your case,  the right decisions were made.  She allowed her service animal out of her control, and given the nature of your condition, it was not possible for her to stop that. It was also in employment, not at a store.  They did attempt to accommodate per the law. So I agree that allergies can require accommodations, but thanks to those who abused it,  they have severely limited the exceptions.", "Yeah. Epipens and an expensive trip to the ER in an ambulance. Quit being so ignorant.", "Take that up with the ADA. They made the definitions.", "Yep. I can't go into Lush, Bath and Bodyworks, the Body Shop, or be in the cosmetics department. I'm pretty much allergic to all trees, so that is probably my trigger.

I had some weird mystery cases of hives a few years ago, and after recounting what I\u2019d eaten prior to them, the doctor hypothesized that I could have developed an allergy to tomatoes.

Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t tomatoes, and the hives remain a mystery as they haven\u2019t come back.", "Same! I started getting seasonal allergies in my late 20's. Prior to that I had no known allergies.", "OP says she doesn't want to be with dogs in enclosed spaces, but if that's the case she could have stepped outside herself and watched through the open door in order to ensure the customer had access - she didn't offer that.  And saying no entry, come back another time, which is almost never since the shop is only staffed by OP basically all the time, IMHO, does not qualify as providing access.  OP does not say her conditions are uncontrolled, only that she once, a long time ago, had a reaction - the standard you are suggesting is that a business owner should be able to claim \"I have an allergy\" and effectively simply exclude disabled people with SDs.  I don't think this is the law and I don't think it should be either.", "You ignored the part where the way the service dog alerted the handler was by *licking*.  Funny that the EEOC didn't cite her failing to control her dog as the reason for siding with us over her.  I also worked in a store, and we were told by both the EEOC *and* USDOJ that we could exclude service dogs if we couldn't accommodate customers with service dogs *and* my allergies.  There were a few customers with service dogs that got booted because they also believed the myth about hypoallergenic dogs.\n\n> it was not possible for her to stop that.\n\nIt was possible for her to train the dog not to lick, she just didn't want to.
