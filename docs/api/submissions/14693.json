I don\u2019t use social media, notably identifying platforms because I have a life-threatening stalker who haunts me to this day.\n\nAlthough I have a restraining order and other protection measures in place, I don\u2019t allow any of my friends to post photos of me on their social medias. E has always respected this throughout the course of our friendship.\n\nAwhile back E asked me if she could start posting my two beautiful cats to her own social media. I have no issues if my cats are posted online, but for my own safety I\u2019m not going to be the one to do so. E really is gifted with photography and is super creative with the videos she makes, not to mention E is stunning. A perfect recipe for views. Who doesn\u2019t look cute cats acting silly with a cute girl? \n\nOver the last few months, her profiles blew up. The videos and pictures get hundreds of thousands of views, sometimes multiple millions. Since her posts are getting so much attention she\u2019s now in a position to make a decent amount of money off of my cats. E has been contacted about partnerships and has even been asked to work under an official social media management company. \n\nShe was super excited about all of it when she was telling me. I was proud of the work she\u2019s done, but during the conversation I asked her for a 30% cut of any profit she makes off of my cats. \n\nShe grew upset with me when I asked her this. Said it was her who was putting in all the effort and spending the time creating the end product that is getting all the views. I countered and said I buy all the cat food, pay the vet bills and scoop the litter box. I even said at the end of the day I could move out tomorrow and take the subject of her content with me. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a threat, but more-so give her perspective on who is the owner and how this proposed revenue stream is completely dependent on me. \n\nShe said that since the cats currently live with both of us, it\u2019s basically free real estate. I will give her due and state that since she works from home and I\u2019m in an office five days a week, she really does spend more time with the cats. But they\u2019re still MY CATS. I had them before we moved in together. They sleep with me every night. I care for them and make sure when I get back I give them love and attention. I\u2019ve set up an account in case something happens to me, they will be taken care of financially. Their microchips have my name and phone number. \n\nAnother huge thing that was brought up was I make substantially more money than my roomate. 4x as much. I\u2019m not hurting for the cash, especially compared to E, but I feel it\u2019s fair if that 30% went to me since I pay for everything in regards to the pet care. \n\nAITA for asking for a cut of the profits since they\u2019re my cats?\n\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who has contributed their input. I appreciate the insight and it\u2019s given me a lot to think about. There are some things I was to clarify and add more detail. \n\n1. Getting other cats: my cats are both rescues but look like they are purebred angels. They also have amazing personalities. I have trained both to perform more than a dozen tricks. While I encourage everyone to clear the shelters and may be biased, my cats really are unique in appearance and not easily replicated. \n\n2. Salary: I wish I was a big cheese throwing hundreds at the club, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the bottom of the totem pole at a corporate job. My roomate is an executive assistant to the CEO of a start-up. While she makes no money, she also only works 30 hours a week. Making 4x her salary is probably most people in this thread. \n\n3. Stalker: sorry this came off a a little sob story it was meant more to explain why I can\u2019t make any content. My roomate said that I \u201ccould never do what she does with the cats\u201d when I asked her for the cut. She\u2019s correct. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s also why I don\u2019t understand anything about how much influencers can make, nor how viral she was going until she told me the views were 10+mm last night. I knew they were popular, but no idea that popular.\n\n\nEdit 2: \n\nMy roomate is in police custody. She punched me after she stole my cats. This thread helped me prove to the cops the cats were mine. If anyone has legal advice on how to break a 9 month left lease, I need it.", "created_utc": 1681389277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12knm5u/aita_for_asking_my_roomate_for_a_cut_of_the/", "score": 2569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a stalker that prevents me from using any identifying social media. My roomate, with my permission, has started posting my cats online and has gone viral. She\u2019s now able to make money from it. I asked her for a 30% cut of the profits she makes off of them since they\u2019re my cats and I pay for all the pet care. \n\n2. I have nothing to do with the content creation process and make a lot more money than my roomate. I still asked for a cut of the profits under the belief it is fair since they\u2019re my cats.

Like I just genuinely don't understand..\nYou also said that you're in the office 5 days a week  I guess for at least 8 to 10 hours everyday and it's not like your cats sleep during that time as they're somewhat nocturnal.\nSo it's safe to asume that your roommate doesn't just spend time with your cats she also entertains and stimulates them during those photoshots does she not?\nAnd she probably also feeds then while you're gone and give them treats and such? If not please correct me.\n\nWhy don't you talk to her (Also I think you should apologize first to get the conversation going on good terms) and try to make a deal.\nIf I were you I would ask for 20 percent and those 20 percent go into a fund for the kitties.

This is costing you absolutely nothing, and you had no interest in it until you saw an opportunity to make a cash grab from her hard work.  \n\nEven if it were reasonable to get some cut, 30% is bullshit and you know it. That is a ridiculous percentage to ask for such a passive role, but you are taking advantage of the fact that you know you have her over a barrel because she may lose all of these opportunities without the cats.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again, you are an opportunistic asshole.", "Nah yet. 30% is a lot.   10 % would honestly be more reasonable in my mind.

She is lying to her viewers, she is pretending like she owns them, I wonder what would happen if these companies found out that she is not even the owner of the cat, how can you possible sign a contract with a company when you don\u2019t even own the product.", "Lots of mixed comments here, end of the day everyone wants their cut of the gravy.", "YTA, look I get it they are your cats, but outside of owning them you aren't doing any of the work that it's taken to create those videos, not to mention you aren't the person being featured either.", "You are the asshole, without question.", "Right? I just started looking at this and this is the first comment that addressed this. OP I\u2019d very much like a bit more of an update between edit 1 and 2", "I know, right!?  This was such a startling update.  Glad OP and the kitties are safe though, OP likely has a second stalker now.", "The cat butler had me rolling!!!! I\u2019m surprised that the vet bills alone weren\u2019t enough to prove she owned the cats. Taking crazy cat lady to a whole new level!!!", "Wait why are you suggesting this? Jealousy?", "She can try to replace the cats but there is no guarantee she will succeed. \nHer accounts only started reaching views in the millions when she used ops cats. The cats are ops property. \n\nGrumpy cats owner made over a million dollars. Do you really think if someone else owned him they wouldn't ask for 30 or even 50% in profits?", "NTA\\* \n\nsurprise but in the real world ppl will want a cut of the money made from THEIR work/training/possesions. OP takes care of the cats, trained the cats which is what roomie is using on the posts, and without OPs cats roomie would have none of this. \n\nOP should be getting OVER 50% for these reasons alone. but especially when roomie is already trying to make the cats out as theirs on the account, and already risked OPs safety by posting a vid that showed OPs face. OP loses nothing by refusing to let roomie use her cats for $/roomie being greedy n not paying the person who caused roomie to get paid for it. If roomie wants to be greedy they can get their own cat and take the long time to train it and hope its good with pics too while explaining to their fans they misled them about it being their cats n why theyre using a new cat (greed)", "Silent partners usually provide capital.

At first, I thought 30% seemed a little high, but given that you trained them, I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable. You must have spent a lot of hours doing this. From what it sounds like, she is only really marking money **BECAUSE** you trained them. She can\u2019t do this with any other cat and would probably take a *long* time to train new ones. I feel like she is just profiting off of all your hard work. \n\nDepending on how much of a presence she has in the video, you might even be cutting yourself short. If she is barely in them and it\u2019s mostly just cat tricks, then that\u2019s all your hard work she is profiting off of NTA", "Thrn ye she gots to go.

Should also deduct taxes first too.", "Cats don\u2019t need a pet sitter during the day. Look it up cats more prefer to be left alone and like to sleep during the day. Know how cats are and their needs before you reply with things like this. I have two and they love their cuddles mostly in the evening and I\u2019m a sahm", "Without the cats there would be no content. So how is 30% too much especially if the cats are all the roommate posts? No cats, no content. And apparently the OP has also trained the cats to do various tricks, which are probably being used in that content. Do you know how hard it is to get a cat to do a trick? I think 30% is perfectly reasonable.", "Oooo did you find the creator she is talking about? What media platform were they on. Is sheet hitting the fan? I am super curious about how pretty the cats look. OP said they had really unique looks so now I am super curious how pretty the cats are. And also what tricks they can do. Hahaha", "That\u2019s not how it works. They pay you on the 1099 and you have to use an agency the agency does more than represent the person. They monitor the post for return on investment views etc. this helps them to determine how much a post is worth sort of like TV commercials TV commercials are all place through a media buying agency.", "She states that the roommate is stunning and is in the posts as well. The combo of them both is what made it popular. Her fan base is probably large enough now that they enjoy the production quality so much and any cat will probably do. We have no videos or evidence of these \u201ctricks\u201d, people exaggerate the \u201cskills\u201d of the things they love all the time (pets, kids etc). For all we know they do basic cat things\u2026\n\nOP had no issues with these posts when it meant nothing to the roommate. The roommate takes the effort into making the production quality of the videos worthwhile. Now that it\u2019s making money, it\u2019s understandable she wants a piece of the pie. She can either sit back, keep doing what she\u2019s been doing and take a humble 10%-15%. Or the roommate can \u201cinvest\u201d in a purebred breed and make 100%. \n\nIf they were my cats, I\u2019d sit back and collect a check.", "Which is a choice.  Not something forced to do.", "Came late and saw your edit about violence and police action.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to research your local state / province / county / city laws, but some areas have tenant protections for victims of crimes or domestic violence.

If she says my friend's cats, they're probably going to ask who you are. People are naturally curious. If you can tell her how you want her to characterize them, that would be more helpful than just saying don't say they're yours. I hope that makes sense. I think you do deserve to be paid, but I think it's really important to have definitive answers to any questions he has about what it is that you actually want her to do in lieu of what she's doing now.", "omg wtf is edit 2 and why is no one talking ab it? nvm i can just go on new comments lol* that fucking escalated. are u good atm op.? - NTA", "Lawyer here: please don\u2019t take legal advice from the internet.

Since there is a police report and now threat of violence you should be able to fairly easily break your lease.

It\u2019s fucked", "OP asking for 30% is far too much, mostly because even if the roommate wasn't making cute/funny videos of OP's cats OP would still be paying for all the same food, toys, litter, vet visits etc. Unless OP wants to make the argument that the roommate making cute/funny videos of her cats has increased the amount of food, litter and vet visits her cats need, then the argument of \"I pay to take care of the cats\" won't actually hold up -- like legally speaking (I don't think OP would take this to court though, but idk).
