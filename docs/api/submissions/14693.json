I don\u2019t use social media, notably identifying platforms because I have a life-threatening stalker who haunts me to this day.\n\nAlthough I have a restraining order and other protection measures in place, I don\u2019t allow any of my friends to post photos of me on their social medias. E has always respected this throughout the course of our friendship.\n\nAwhile back E asked me if she could start posting my two beautiful cats to her own social media. I have no issues if my cats are posted online, but for my own safety I\u2019m not going to be the one to do so. E really is gifted with photography and is super creative with the videos she makes, not to mention E is stunning. A perfect recipe for views. Who doesn\u2019t look cute cats acting silly with a cute girl? \n\nOver the last few months, her profiles blew up. The videos and pictures get hundreds of thousands of views, sometimes multiple millions. Since her posts are getting so much attention she\u2019s now in a position to make a decent amount of money off of my cats. E has been contacted about partnerships and has even been asked to work under an official social media management company. \n\nShe was super excited about all of it when she was telling me. I was proud of the work she\u2019s done, but during the conversation I asked her for a 30% cut of any profit she makes off of my cats. \n\nShe grew upset with me when I asked her this. Said it was her who was putting in all the effort and spending the time creating the end product that is getting all the views. I countered and said I buy all the cat food, pay the vet bills and scoop the litter box. I even said at the end of the day I could move out tomorrow and take the subject of her content with me. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a threat, but more-so give her perspective on who is the owner and how this proposed revenue stream is completely dependent on me. \n\nShe said that since the cats currently live with both of us, it\u2019s basically free real estate. I will give her due and state that since she works from home and I\u2019m in an office five days a week, she really does spend more time with the cats. But they\u2019re still MY CATS. I had them before we moved in together. They sleep with me every night. I care for them and make sure when I get back I give them love and attention. I\u2019ve set up an account in case something happens to me, they will be taken care of financially. Their microchips have my name and phone number. \n\nAnother huge thing that was brought up was I make substantially more money than my roomate. 4x as much. I\u2019m not hurting for the cash, especially compared to E, but I feel it\u2019s fair if that 30% went to me since I pay for everything in regards to the pet care. \n\nAITA for asking for a cut of the profits since they\u2019re my cats?\n\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who has contributed their input. I appreciate the insight and it\u2019s given me a lot to think about. There are some things I was to clarify and add more detail. \n\n1. Getting other cats: my cats are both rescues but look like they are purebred angels. They also have amazing personalities. I have trained both to perform more than a dozen tricks. While I encourage everyone to clear the shelters and may be biased, my cats really are unique in appearance and not easily replicated. \n\n2. Salary: I wish I was a big cheese throwing hundreds at the club, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the bottom of the totem pole at a corporate job. My roomate is an executive assistant to the CEO of a start-up. While she makes no money, she also only works 30 hours a week. Making 4x her salary is probably most people in this thread. \n\n3. Stalker: sorry this came off a a little sob story it was meant more to explain why I can\u2019t make any content. My roomate said that I \u201ccould never do what she does with the cats\u201d when I asked her for the cut. She\u2019s correct. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s also why I don\u2019t understand anything about how much influencers can make, nor how viral she was going until she told me the views were 10+mm last night. I knew they were popular, but no idea that popular.", "created_utc": 1681389277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12knm5u/aita_for_asking_my_roomate_for_a_cut_of_the/", "score": 325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a stalker that prevents me from using any identifying social media. My roomate, with my permission, has started posting my cats online and has gone viral.

I have nothing to do with the content creation process and make a lot more money than my roomate. I still asked for a cut of the profits under the belief it is fair since they\u2019re my cats.

Like I just genuinely don't understand..\nYou also said that you're in the office 5 days a week  I guess for at least 8 to 10 hours everyday and it's not like your cats sleep during that time as they're somewhat nocturnal.\nSo it's safe to asume that your roommate doesn't just spend time with your cats she also entertains and stimulates them during those photoshots does she not?\nAnd she probably also feeds then while you're gone and give them treats and such? If not please correct me.\n\nWhy don't you talk to her (Also I think you should apologize first to get the conversation going on good terms) and try to make a deal.\nIf I were you I would ask for 20 percent and those 20 percent go into a fund for the kitties.

This is costing you absolutely nothing, and you had no interest in it until you saw an opportunity to make a cash grab from her hard work.  \n\nEven if it were reasonable to get some cut, 30% is bullshit and you know it. That is a ridiculous percentage to ask for such a passive role, but you are taking advantage of the fact that you know you have her over a barrel because she may lose all of these opportunities without the cats.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again, you are an opportunistic asshole.", "Nah yet. 30% is a lot.   10 % would honestly be more reasonable in my mind.

And that 10% should go to cover cat costs.", "YTA for asking for 30%.\n\nYour effort - paying for the cats - is static. \n\nHer work is continual and ongoing and probably hours of editing/content creation a day.\n\nYou're also benefiting from her socialising and entertaining your cats whilst you're at work.\n\nI think asking for 50% of your insurance/pet food costs would be reasonable.\n\nBut not a static cut.
