I don\u2019t use social media, notably identifying platforms because I have a life-threatening stalker who haunts me to this day.\n\nAlthough I have a restraining order and other protection measures in place, I don\u2019t allow any of my friends to post photos of me on their social medias. E has always respected this throughout the course of our friendship.\n\nAwhile back E asked me if she could start posting my two beautiful cats to her own social media. I have no issues if my cats are posted online, but for my own safety I\u2019m not going to be the one to do so. E really is gifted with photography and is super creative with the videos she makes, not to mention E is stunning. A perfect recipe for views. Who doesn\u2019t look cute cats acting silly with a cute girl? \n\nOver the last few months, her profiles blew up. The videos and pictures get hundreds of thousands of views, sometimes multiple millions. Since her posts are getting so much attention she\u2019s now in a position to make a decent amount of money off of my cats. E has been contacted about partnerships and has even been asked to work under an official social media management company. \n\nShe was super excited about all of it when she was telling me. I was proud of the work she\u2019s done, but during the conversation I asked her for a 30% cut of any profit she makes off of my cats. \n\nShe grew upset with me when I asked her this. Said it was her who was putting in all the effort and spending the time creating the end product that is getting all the views. I countered and said I buy all the cat food, pay the vet bills and scoop the litter box. I even said at the end of the day I could move out tomorrow and take the subject of her content with me. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a threat, but more-so give her perspective on who is the owner and how this proposed revenue stream is completely dependent on me. \n\nShe said that since the cats currently live with both of us, it\u2019s basically free real estate. I will give her due and state that since she works from home and I\u2019m in an office five days a week, she really does spend more time with the cats. But they\u2019re still MY CATS. I had them before we moved in together. They sleep with me every night. I care for them and make sure when I get back I give them love and attention. I\u2019ve set up an account in case something happens to me, they will be taken care of financially. Their microchips have my name and phone number. \n\nAnother huge thing that was brought up was I make substantially more money than my roomate. 4x as much. I\u2019m not hurting for the cash, especially compared to E, but I feel it\u2019s fair if that 30% went to me since I pay for everything in regards to the pet care. \n\nAITA for asking for a cut of the profits since they\u2019re my cats?\n\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who has contributed their input. I appreciate the insight and it\u2019s given me a lot to think about. There are some things I was to clarify and add more detail. \n\n1. Getting other cats: my cats are both rescues but look like they are purebred angels. They also have amazing personalities. I have trained both to perform more than a dozen tricks. While I encourage everyone to clear the shelters and may be biased, my cats really are unique in appearance and not easily replicated. \n\n2. Salary: I wish I was a big cheese throwing hundreds at the club, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m the bottom of the totem pole at a corporate job. My roomate is an executive assistant to the CEO of a start-up. While she makes no money, she also only works 30 hours a week. Making 4x her salary is probably most people in this thread. \n\n3. Stalker: sorry this came off a a little sob story it was meant more to explain why I can\u2019t make any content. My roomate said that I \u201ccould never do what she does with the cats\u201d when I asked her for the cut. She\u2019s correct. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s also why I don\u2019t understand anything about how much influencers can make, nor how viral she was going until she told me the views were 10+mm last night. I knew they were popular, but no idea that popular.", "created_utc": 1681389277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12knm5u/aita_for_asking_my_roomate_for_a_cut_of_the/", "score": 1155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a stalker that prevents me from using any identifying social media. My roomate, with my permission, has started posting my cats online and has gone viral.

I have nothing to do with the content creation process and make a lot more money than my roomate. I still asked for a cut of the profits under the belief it is fair since they\u2019re my cats.

If not please correct me.\n\nWhy don't you talk to her (Also I think you should apologize first to get the conversation going on good terms) and try to make a deal.\nIf I were you I would ask for 20 percent and those 20 percent go into a fund for the kitties.

This is costing you absolutely nothing, and you had no interest in it until you saw an opportunity to make a cash grab from her hard work.  \n\nEven if it were reasonable to get some cut, 30% is bullshit and you know it. That is a ridiculous percentage to ask for such a passive role, but you are taking advantage of the fact that you know you have her over a barrel because she may lose all of these opportunities without the cats.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again, you are an opportunistic asshole.", "Nah yet. 30% is a lot.   10 % would honestly be more reasonable in my mind.

Now I have two uninsurable 17 YO cats (a complete blessing, I know how lucky I am to be able to say that!) whose vet bills are growing astronomically. They are both happy and relatively healthy but it takes a lot of money to keep them that way.", "Great idea!\n\nOP mention she has an account set up should something happen to her, she should ask the roommate to create an account for the cats and pay them residuals. That can be set aside for their future care", "Yeah um, cats don\u2019t want to be loved on all day. And lots of people have jobs that take them out of the house, it doesn\u2019t make them bad owners because they aren\u2019t home 24/7 to entertain their cats.", " I did text her and said I saw the video and she didn\u2019t respond but it has been removed. Thankfully unless you knew to scrutinize the background it would be something very easy to miss. Appreciate the well wishes and will be sure to give the boys a big squish!", "People might love that. People laugh, ugly and grumpy cats. that cat could become an Internet sensation.", "As someone who watches tons of cat videos, most of the super viral cats on social media are ones who are not only photogenic but also know how to do tricks, and OP was the one who taught her cat to do that", "But then OP does mention she's trained her cats multiple tricks, which probably took hours, and i assume not all cats are as capable of that as others.", "That's like my mean mug cat. She's super teeny and adorable and has these big green eyes and she's so timid. And then you pick up your phone and her eyes just flatten on the top and she ends up looking like a b----. My SO and I just laugh about it now. None of our friends will ever meet her because she hides immediately and now we can't even show them photographic evidence that she's super cute. My nephew stayed for two weeks and she finally showed herself to him and he was like \"she's your prettiest cat\".", "I totally missed the approached by sponsors. Neither the sponsor nor agent/management company will move forward without a contract with OP. Roommate will lose any deal she has for not disclosing they're someone else's cats and not having anything in writing.\n\nI thought this was hypothetical. \n\nOP and Roommate are really making the wrong deal; OPs ownership must be disclosed and she must be credited; since she has a stalker, all of this is a moot point. She should rescind permission for her cats to appear on her roommate's videos.", "Still not enough to prove ownership in some cases. Check this out.

Millions of views per video. Now she has new cats it\u2019s down to tens of thousands per video, a fraction of what it was before. The parasocial relationship was with the cat, not the person making the videos.", "Omg my sister's does the same thing, just hides as soon as someone she doesn't know comes over! Thankfully because we used to live together she'll come out for me, but yeah there's been a few times of \"she's gorgeous I swear! I just...can't show you that\" \ud83d\ude05", "I think OP just meant very little money.", "They approached.   The initial conversation Op and E was they want to sponsor the cat videos. So this is how it goes. Since I have been approached on social media. Management company contacts via DM.  Cuz company  lilies your content and would like to sponsor. you reply l am interested. Then they send an application. The application will ask if you  own the the content (videos, picture, and the product in this case the cats. There a whole lot of other questions that are asked. You send it back to them for verification. The will do a background check and run a credit report.  The last thing a company wants is a constant provider with skeletons in their closet that could ruin their brand.", "You are correct. I have found out that E is claiming the boys to her own online. Not explicitly, but saying \u201ccat moms are the craziest!\u201d And \u201cmy son is beautiful\u201d kind of rhetoric. Enough to give the impression they are hers.", "My friends are always saying \"I thought you had 3 cats\". \n\nMy mum started calling her \"ghost cat\" and has only seen her once on a visit because she fell asleep on my couch and woke up just in time to see her. She did say \"Ghost Cat\" rather loudly so no more appearances to the loud lady.", "Then she needs to pay up or fuck off and use somone else's cats.", "And you'd better teach them not to eat Edgar's soup.", "Yeeeaaaah I would not be comfortable with that at all OP. If I were you I wouldn't bother negotiating for a percentage, just cut her off completely. Let her get her own cats and pay for their upkeep herself.", "She might just do that.", "Do you mean cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me \u00e0 la Edgar?", "Ok but the photo on the living room wall in the apartment used to house the cats where E takes the photos, who owns that art??? Checkmate lib.", "I think you nailed it. So much more has happened that makes me nervous I\u2019m going to leave work today and my cats are going to be gone. Thank you for the advice.", "Not the landlord probably? You\u2019re owning yourself, dumbass.", "If she can make $$ without the cats  good on her.  But if she still needs the cats, then she needs to pay until she has her own cats trained. Training cats is not easy.  Everything is a trade off, I use yahoo mail for free they get whatever info they want and sell it on, it\u2019s a business transaction. Similarly to cheap TVs they sell your data.  Nothing is free", "Using the words little and no are not grammar related, they are words with their own definitions and should be used correctly. \n\nIf this person made no money at their job and this was their only source of income it would change the situation, but they have a job that earns them an income that they can fall back on without the cats.", "I had faith my comment wouldn\u2019t need an /s. You proved me wrong.", "I don\u2019t think paying is unreasonable however, I think 10% is enough. She\u2019s also keeping the cats entertained.", "Once again nothing added to the conversation, can't imagine you are a joy to converse with"]}
