I have a stalker that prevents me from using any identifying social media. My roomate, with my permission, has started posting my cats online and has gone viral. She\u2019s now able to make money from it. I asked her for a 30% cut of the profits she makes off of them since they\u2019re my cats and I pay for all the pet care. \n\n2. I have nothing to do with the content creation process and make a lot more money than my roomate. I still asked for a cut of the profits under the belief it is fair since they\u2019re my cats.

They aren\u2019t her and she should disclose that to her brand.", "NTA. But 10-15% is more reasonable.", "NTA\n\nShe should have come to you with a proposal. It doesn\u2019t matter who makes more from their salary.", "NAH. You're not the AH for asking for a cut but expecting 30% is somewhat ridiculous and indicates to me that you have little idea in how much a successful social media presence depends on the person doing all the filming, editing and producing. Your roommate is not the AH for expecting to make a fair reward for all her work, but as you say, they are your cats and without them she'd have nothing. Perhaps now the two of you can sit down like the adults you are and agree a more reasonable split (half of all cat-related bills and maybe 10% of any profit?) If you can't reach an agreement, forbid her from using your cats in her videos.", "nta but just leave and take the cats with you", "I\u2019m going to say NAH but you WBTA for seriously expecting 30% of her profit. You were/ are paying the cat expenses either way whether she\u2019s making the videos or not, and you make significantly more than her. But I do agree that in this capitalist economy people expect to make money off people using their \u201cproperty/likeness\u201d (the cats), maybe renegotiate to a much lesser amount. This is not worth being petty over", "I don't get all the YTA on here. Yea everyone is right she can go get her own cats. So let her go get her own cats. I would tell her from now on you prefer to nit have your cats filmed and if she can't agree you will mollie put. Let her get her own pets and take care of them so she can't exploit them for money.", "NTA. It's like you're your cats agent, and you deserve a cut. If you moved out, she wouldn't be able to continue with the cat pics, so why does she feel so entitled to use your cats in her posts without compensating you for their services.", "NTA\n\nAt the end of the day they are your cats and her profit is solely coming from creating content of them.

Fighting over the money afterwards is just going to end badly for everyone involved.", "Up it to 40% and then settle for 30% again. NTA", "YTA. Let's be realistic, most cats are cute. Cats that make it big as influencers do so because there is a creative photographer/videographer behind the blog that features them. She is the driving force and the source of revenue behind the blog, not the cats. If you take away the cats, she'll get another pair and will soon be just as successful. So yes, a 30% cut is certainly unrealistic.", "YTA, you have put zero effort into the enterprise, these are cats you would already be taking care of because they are your pets, so it's a moot point.\n\nHowever I think it's fair if you want her to halt posting your pets. That would be perfectly reasonable. You just shouldn't be demanding payment for something you have put zero work into.", "You absolutely sound like an AH. You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing to earn any of the revenue, yet you want 30%? You\u2019re not just an AH, you\u2019re a greedy AH.", "NAH... but 30% is pretty high ask.  5 to 10 would make more sense.  You didnt buy the cats for her specifically to use them for her videos, you dont train them to do anything in particular... you've done zero work, and she actually does all the work.  Your life would not change at all if she didn't put the cats in her videos.  If she was a gamer making money off her videos of her talking about games, would you want a cut because the background of her videos is your wall?", "Uff....I'm sorry but you do really sound like An a hole.\nI was kinda with you and thought that the 30 percent should go into a savings account for your cats until you said you make four times as much money as she does.\nI just don't understand why you feel the need to get this money from her if you already make so much money? Like I just genuinely don't understand..\nYou also said that you're in the office 5 days a week  I guess for at least 8 to 10 hours everyday and it's not like your cats sleep during that time as they're somewhat nocturnal.\nSo it's safe to asume that your roommate doesn't just spend time with your cats she also entertains and stimulates them during those photoshots does she not?\nAnd she probably also feeds then while you're gone and give them treats and such? If not please correct me.\n\nWhy don't you talk to her (Also I think you should apologize first to get the conversation going on good terms) and try to make a deal.\nIf I were you I would ask for 20 percent and those 20 percent go into a fund for the kitties. Also if she isn't already cleaning up after the cats and feeding them she should start doing that maybe.\nYou two and the cats have such a great thing going on don't ruin that. If not for you then do it for your cats because I'm sure they have a lot of fun interacting with your roommate.\n\nI mean honestly you kinda got a cat sitter for free on your hands\n\nSo I'm voting YTA but I really really hope you two can find a solution you're both happy with :)", "YTA\n\nLet's be real: She could just get other cats. What makes her successful is HER and then the quality of posts and consistency, etc. Cute cats are just not rare.\n\nThe most you could ask if her to cover some of your cat expenses such as their food. Even that is a bit presumptuous, but anyhow.\n\nYou would not have asked her for anything if it was just a little bit of money but now that it's real, you've got your hand out and that's kinda off-putting, TBH.", "YTA.  Big time.  This is costing you absolutely nothing, and you had no interest in it until you saw an opportunity to make a cash grab from her hard work.  \n\nEven if it were reasonable to get some cut, 30% is bullshit and you know it. That is a ridiculous percentage to ask for such a passive role, but you are taking advantage of the fact that you know you have her over a barrel because she may lose all of these opportunities without the cats.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again, you are an opportunistic asshole.", "Nah yet. 30% is a lot.   10 % would honestly be more reasonable in my mind.  And only from future profits of direct cat posts. Not sponsorships, not partnerships. And that 10% should go to cover cat costs.", "YTA for asking for 30%.\n\nYour effort - paying for the cats - is static. \n\nHer work is continual and ongoing and probably hours of editing/content creation a day.\n\nYou're also benefiting from her socialising and entertaining your cats whilst you're at work.\n\nI think asking for 50% of your insurance/pet food costs would be reasonable.\n\nBut not a static cut. She's just gonna get a kitten if you continue and ultimately your cats will be worse off.", "ESH\nStop all work with the cats until both of you can come to an agreement.\nResearch with some animal wranglers: what's fair pay, what's fair conditions for work for the cats. \nNot sure what stalkers have to do with any of this except for \"pity me and support my side, \" which is an AH move.", "I was with you right until the last paragraph...you make 4x more than her? And want to take almost a third of her profits??\nThat's greedy. YTA", "ESH, but you more.\n\nAsk her to pay for some of the food and other costs, since she is profiting of your \"property\", but 30% while you make so much more money is imho crazy.\n\nAnd I'm Dutch, so I know a thing a or two about stinginess", "YTA - you sound selfish and greedy. And also jealous. \n\n>I make substantially more money than my roomate. 4x as much\n\nYeah, huge AH. \n\nYou wanted a cut you should have said something before they blew up. Be happy for your roommate and be a better person.", "Don\u2019t see why people are saying OP is the AH.\nShe can\u2019t safely do this herself and they ARE her cats. I would only say to be willing to go down to maybe 15 to 20%? It\u2019s better than nothing and does seem like a cool opportunity.", "NTA - 30% seems reasonable, it acknowledges that she does the work but you pay for the cats. However, if you're not hurting for money and she could use it, are you sure this is a hill you want to die on? Not disagreeing with the principle, just wondering if you want to prioritise that over a good relationship with your flatmate.\n\nEdit: read other comments, I'd agree 10-15% is more reasonable", "Yta.
