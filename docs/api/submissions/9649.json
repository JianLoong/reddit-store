They don't have a single human on earth that they trust enough to watch their kids for about 6 hours, they don't want to try to start to trust someone over the next 10 months, they are concerned who will watch their combined three dogs, and that's the fucking issue right now. She has known this since the day we got engaged, we all talked about it when we went down to celebrate our engagement, and she and I have texted about it two to three times and it wasn't an issue like it is right now.

Since half of them aren't coming, I feel like we should cancel and elope. \n\nHer plan was to bring her mom and have her watch the kids but now her mom's husband is sick so she might not want to so now but her message mentioned cost as a huge factor so I'm not sure exactly what the actual reason is.

An invite isn\u2019t a summons.", "Info please explain the idea of them finding someone to watch their kids for only 6 hours but the wedding is thousands of miles away. Are you expecting them to start trusting someone, then leave their kids for a few days with the person to fly to Colorado or do you expect them to fly this trusted person to Colorado as well for the wedding", "YTA. Sometimes childfree weddings mean that family members with kids can't make it. There's nothing wrong with having one, but you *must* be understanding that it makes things difficult for parents.", "YTA. \n\nI'm sure they do have people they can trust with their kids for 6 hours.  *In Florida.*  The wedding is in Colorado.  You can make whatever rules you want for your wedding, but you don't get to demand that everyone invited has to just figure it out.", "Listen you made the choice of kid free which means some people may not come. Just because people are playing by your rules and you don\u2019t like it you can\u2019t be annoyed at them. If her not going means you want to elope talk to your partner and get their thoughts. This seems borderline bridezilla behavior", "Yea, YTA. It\u2019s fine you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding, that\u2019s your right.\n\nThat said, you are dismissing very valid concerns over cost and care of both their animals and their children. You\u2019re acting like it\u2019s some huge issue that they don\u2019t want to trust people with their children. Frankly, they should be careful with who they trust because terrible things can happen if they\u2019re not. They also don\u2019t live in your state, how are they supposed to find people they trust? Bring someone with them from home? That adds more cost in flights, hotels, travel in general because they\u2019d have to pay for them the whole time not just for the wedding. That\u2019s a ton of extra cost, which you don\u2019t seem to take into consideration. \n\nYou wanting to cancel the wedding over this is a definite overreaction. If you don\u2019t want a wedding and want to elope, fine. Again, your wedding your choice.

If you want a child free wedding, that\u2019s fine; but you need to know that people with kids may not be able to make it.", "YTA... Its your wedding, why cancel the day because of two people. Just enjoy the day with the people who want to show up for you. Also anyone who decides to have a child free wedding should accept that some people won't be able to make it for that exact reason. Don't take everything so personally.", "YTA. They're not demanding that you accept their children at the wedding.  They're not being dramatic or petty about it.  They're basically just sending their regrets and saying,  \"Sorry.  Don't think we can make it.\" My brother and his wife didn't make it to my wedding because of college finals.  People have lives,  they're not being dramatic about it.  And you're considering calling off the wedding because one couple is not willing to drop everything and pay tons of money and then have their kids be all grumpy about traveling when they're not even invited.  Wow. Chillax", "YTA You want a child free wedding and that is what you should have however you can\u2019t be upset if those with kids decide not to attend.

And that's OK!\n\n\nIf they say they can't attend that's also OK....\n\n\nYou can't demand a child free wedding and be annoyed that people with kids say that sorry they can't attend!\n\nYTA", "YTA\nI\u2019ve skipped child-free weddings. People forget that it\u2019s likely that a couple\u2019s entire roster of babysitters will also be at the wedding.\n\nChild-free weddings suck.", "YTA.  Don't be so dramatic. \n\n You don't want kids at your wedding: that's your prerogative. Your BIL and SIL don't feel comfortable with spending beaucoup bucks on airfare and finding someone to watch their child and tiny infant: that's their prerogative.  Their primary priority *should* be their children, and you will have to learn to accept it. \n\n You may be living a childfree life, but you cannot control the lives of the people around you.  Many of them will have kids, and you will have to learn to be okay with not being the most important person in the room to them.\n\n Just behave like an adult and continue to have your wedding with your friends as guests.  Cancelling it is throwing a hissy fit.", "YTA - You are overreacting.  Take a deep breath.  This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, and the commitment you are making to share your lives with each other.  If his family is unable to attend, that is sad, it does not stop you from getting married.  \n\nYou need to understand that this trip will cost several thousand dollars for them to come and visit.  Boarding 3 dogs for a week will run close to $1000.  Plane tickets for the brother, his wife, their 2 kids, and her mother will probably be over $2000.  Then there's the rental car and hotels.\n\nAnd realize that if her mom can't come, even if you hire a **professional** babysitter for them, they may not be comfortable leaving their (very young) kids with a stranger for the day.\n\nAgain, them not being able to attend does not mean you can't get married.  Maybe look into having a live stream of the wedding, that got very popular a couple years ago.  You having a tantrum and threatening to cancel your wedding because it won't all work out perfectly is not the way to go.", "YTA.   Don't be ridiculous.     You're acting like a spoilt little child threatening to take her ball and go home just because another kid played differently than she wanted.     \n\n\nPro tip: the VAST majority of responsible parents are not going to leave their children with a sitter they don't know.    And even if they get a trusted family sitter in the intervening ten months, they're not going to leave the children overnight.      Their plan, to have close family do the sitting, won't pan out.    \n\n\nBoarding dogs is insanely expensive.  Plane tickets for four to six people is insanely expensive.   Professional child care is insanely expensive.   Adding up all of this, my guess is they'd be looking at 6-7 grand just to come. That simply may not be realistic.   \n\n\nAs AITA is fond of saying it's an invitation, not a summons.      You are well within your rights to have a child free wedding.  They are well within their rights to say that that kind of trip is completely unrealistic for them right now.   Grow up.", "A child-free wedding is your choice and a valid one. That's cool. But you're asking people to leave young children behind and fly 4-5 hours away where, in case of an emergency, there's no way they'll be able to respond quickly. \n\nYour words are a little too petulant and entitled - if you don't have kids, you don't get to tell people that they should feel totally fine travelling a 4 hour flight away from them. What exactly is going through your head that you think that's a reasonable expectation? If something happened to their child, it won't be your life that's impacted.\n\nYour wedding, you choice...and their choice to attend or not attend. Humbly accept that given the distance, given the child-free requirement and so forth, some people will be absent.", "YTA- your expectation that parents are going to leave their children - especially those who are still babies and/or nursing. It is unrealistic. If you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding and reception- that\u2019s fine- but there are parents that won\u2019t be willing to make that trip. \n\nAt some family weddings I went to that were child free- the parents teamed up to corral all the cousins at a house and rotated on child care duties. The kids had a blast. But we were not far from home so there was an advantage there. We also had family-friendly stuff the day before and after - and the parents didn\u2019t mind not having the kids at the ceremony and reception. They were relieved to have a little time away knowing their kids were well looked after. Maybe ask if you did something like this if it would change their answers.\n\nAlso- how does your husband to be feel about these people skipping out on his wedding?", "YTA. People have responsibilities outside your wedding. Dogs are a responsibility no matter whether you think it is or not. Kids are a major responsibility and yes, you can't just leave them with anyone. Have you not watched any true crime show? Have you not seen how many lax let sitters don't do their jobs properly? Even the pet sitter we used when we got married did a shoddy job and she was highly recommended.\n\nIt's still 10 months away and even if they can't be there in person, there's no reason why you can enjoy yourselves. Have a live stream for those who can't make it. You've given them the notice, if they can't make it they can't make it but don't spite yourself and your fiance and the rest of the family for it \n.", "YTA - I get that you\u2019re frustrated; however cancelling the wedding seems an extreme reaction when all they\u2019ve done is rudely voice their concerns over the cost and arrangements.  You may have talked about it before, but I guarantee it didn\u2019t register until they started actually making plans.  \n\nIt is expensive to travel and it is difficult to find someone trusted to dog sit, let alone babysit.  These are not your worries though, and the more appropriate reaction would be to convey your understanding of the difficulties and regret if they are unable to attend. \n\nNot saying your hurt and anger aren\u2019t valid, but try to look at the whole picture, not just your close-up.  I would have gone with E S H but your dismissal of their valid concerns and extreme overreaction to cancel landed you in a h territory.  You can\u2019t expect people to see if from your point of view when you\u2019re dismissing/belittling theirs.", "When you have you have your own 4 month old you may get it better.\n\nI think you may be buying a bit too much into it being your day.   The more impediments you put on things, the more people are going to bail.  You can't say you want to spend it with your family... but then tell them to leave their kids behind.  Nope.\n\nOh, and your burning bridges that will remain burnt for a long time in the future.\n\nStop thinking about you, fix some fences and put up with a crying baby or two.", "YTA. You're absolutely allowed to have a child free wedding.  But then you need to accept that not everyone can make it.  You're talking about the cost of airfare for the whole family, hotel, sitter, etc.  And I wouldn't want to have a stranger watch my infant, either.", "YTA. Travel, boarding pets, and childcare are all expensive. You expect her to start looking for someone to trust to watch her kids in a completely different state??? If she can\u2019t make it she can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s an invitation and by saying no kids (completely your choice) you have to understand there will be people that\u2019s can\u2019t make it. Stop overreacting.", "When you have a child free wedding, you have to accept that some people can\u2019t go, like they have to accept they can\u2019t bring their kids. You can feel how you feel about it but that\u2019s a consequence not allowing kids.", "YTA. Any one is entitled to have a child free wedding. That being said, any parent is entitled to not go to said wedding. I don\u2019t trust anyone with my daughter hardly (I was abused as a child by a close family member). No wedding is worth that risk to me.", "YTA, chill out bridezilla.", "YTA. You are entirely within your rights to make the wedding childfree. But part of what that will mean is that some families will decline their invitations. That is *their* right, and you're throwing a tantrum because they chose a course of action which they have just as much right to choose as you have to choose a childfree wedding in the first place. \n\nAnyone and everyone has the right to refuse an invitation. Any invitation. For any reason or none at all. If you're not mature enough to be comfortable with someone saying no to you, then you're not mature enough to get married.", "YTA.

Have fun it's your day, but you can't force people to attend.", "YTA - They can't make it work. They don't feel comfortable leaving their very little kids and travelling thousands of miles (and paying probably thousands of dollars to a sitter) and leaving them behind and they probably don't know anyone close to the venue to watch them. She was willing to go to the significant expense of brining her mother along with the kids but that's not going to work now because of a family illness. She tells you that there are just too many logistical and financial obstacles for her to be able to come to your wedding, despite the fact that she was willing to commit a pretty fair amount of money to trying to come to the wedding, the two of them are 4% of your overall allotted 50 guests and when she tells you you can't make it your reaction is \"I'LL CANCEL THE WHOLE WEDDING!\" yeah you're being dramatic, and spoiled.", "YTA - I\u2019m all for child-free weddings. But, come on. Surely you know that when you have a child-free wedding, there will be some people\u2026.even people who are close to you\u2026who will not attend due to child care or because they just don\u2019t want to go to an event without their children. In fact, a minimum requirement for a bride and groom who want a childfree wedding is to be okay with this reality. This cannot be news to you.", "YTA.  Take a deep breath.  It\u2019s one day.  You\u2019ll still be married afterwards no matter who attends.  Asking guests with kids to travel for a child-free wedding is a lot - they\u2019ll have to find a babysitter at the location or else have someone watch the kids for multiple days at home.  Especially if the children are very young, that\u2019s expensive and stressful.  If it is really important to you to be surrounded by family, include the kids.  If it is most important to you to have a perfectly choreographed wedding with no crying babies, then understand that you\u2019ve made your wedding unwelcoming to parents.", "YTA. Other people have lives and their own concerns.

If you ended up cancelling the wedding and they found out why, they might find it a slap in the face that the determine factor that your wedding was going to happen was because of 2 people. Ultimately, it's your decision. But I'd also think long and hard before pulling the plug on the wedding.", "NAH. Weddings can be expensive for guests, especially child-free weddings. Travel, babysitters, dog sitters, gift. The day will be stressful and not fun for them. Maybe when you texted her about it before she didn\u2019t really think it through. Now she has, and realises it\u2019s going to be expensive and difficult. Her kids are young.\n\nWhether you go ahead with the wedding is up to you, but I don\u2019t think you can be mad if someone is telling you they can\u2019t go this far ahead. I get why you\u2019re disappointed. I would go with the elope option if I were you, or just have your parents and a couple of close friends. You can opt for a child-free wedding, but you can\u2019t get annoyed when people decline to come.\n\nEdit: updated to YTA. Your SIL has told you they are not coming, and why. It would be expensive and stressful for her. Do you want to make people come even if they would be unhappy? Accept her decision gracefully and decide what you want to do about your wedding.", "There's been quite the bunch of wedding posts. Childfree weddings are very reasonable, but you have to understand that it'll limit some people from traveling.

NTA if you want to cancel your wedding, because it's what you want to do, but you'd be the asshole if you got super angry toward this part of the family for not being able to make it. Either they can't or don't want to make it; those are not unreasonable things.", "ESH, but you especially. Inlaws suck for pressuring you on the no kids thing, and you suck for 1.)

Yes, they should have been more gracious about it, but mom staying behind with the kids while everyone else attends is a reasonable compromise. And your reaction to this reasonable compromise is... to want to cancel the wedding?! Holy mother of overreactions. Yes, that is very dramatic and uncalled for.

If I could do it again, I\u2019d just elope. So much easier. \n\nSlight YTA as it seems you overreacted. You told them it was a child free wedding. If they want to go, they\u2019ll sort child care. If they can\u2019t/won\u2019t, then they won\u2019t go. And that\u2019s that. Don\u2019t worry yourself about whether or not people show up because boundaries you\u2019ve set in place for YOUR day.", "YTA.\n\nHere's the thing. The wedding day is probably the most important day in the life of the Bride and Groom.  No doubt.\n\nThe problem arises in that it's NOT the most important day in the life of everybody else.\n\nI honestly don't understand why so many people don't understand this.\n\nMy wedding day ... a big day for husband and I.  Interestingly enough, it was surpassed by the birth of my son, and then the birth of my daughter, and then ....\n\nEven my daughter's wedding did NOT beat out the day of her birth, as far as importance to me.\n\nSo, yeah. A few people can't make it?  Tough.  I suspect that your family members who have kids have days that are VASTLY more important to them than OP's wedding.", "YTA - two things here. You\u2019re expecting people to travel and have a child free wedding. Both of those things will deter people from attending. Also giving off big time bridezilla vibes", "YTA-it\u2019s totally reasonable to have a child free wedding. It\u2019s also totally reasonable for someone to not want to jump through hoops and leave their child with people they don\u2019t trust in order to attend your child free wedding.", "YTA. You can have a child free wedding but you have to accept that that means people with young kids might not come, especially when those people would be traveling from states away. Those kids are very young, thats a long way to travel and leave them behind. Stop being a bridezilla and accept the consequences of your decisions.", "It sounds like you are feeling very stressed. Your SIL is probably very stressed also. When you have a one year old, there are often only one or two people the kid knows well enough that they would be comfortable being left with. Your SIL made a plan and is frustrated that it no longer works. She doesn\u2019t have a comfortable back up. \nThe travel money is huge for her. Maybe, just the husband goes and only stays a couple of nights?  Sorry\u2014life sucks!", "You are being dramatic but you're NTA.\n\nHave the wedding you want. If you do elope have a friend perform the ceremony, with other friends and family that are close attending, and someone broadcasting on Zoom or something so out of state people can watch and use the money you save for your future life or a honeymoon.", "Just accept the \"No.\"\n\nAn out of state wedding is a major pain in the ass for people with little kids. I wouldn't make a new friend just to dump my kids with and travel out of state. (Dogs, yes. Kids, no.)\n\nNor would I spend $900 - $1,200 to park them with a sitter.\n\nHave your childfree wedding. Understand that it's a barrier. Accept the no graciously.", "ESH- your brother and SIL shouldn\u2019t be stressing you out with their worries about babysitting & costs. December is a very long way away.\n\nYou are also be dramatic about threatening to cancel the weddings cause 2 of the 50 guests might not be able to make it.\n\nEveryone needs to calm the heck down and take a breath", "My brain understands this concept. I know, I'm telling everyone, I know. The kids wouldn't be in another state, they are welcome to every single other event surrounding the wedding and my house is their house for the entire trip. I know parents can't control or predict their kid's high pitched screaming throwing their body on the floor tantrums, and I do not expect them to, so while we are having people serve food, recording the ceremony, everyone drinking at the open bar etc etc... After confirming with every single mother of a minor, we decided it to be best to be a kid-free event. We were told that would be okay, her mom could come and her brother also lives in Colorado so there were plans. Due to those plans and all that confirmation, we planned as we did. Idk what part of seeing the Save The Date or the website completely changed everything, but it did. We talked about eloping and they objected and wanted to be involved so that's what we did. They gave us a hard no about leaving the country for a destination wedding, so we did not go that route. I asked about Colorado and the logistics and they confirmed, which I think is more than other engaged couples would do, so we did what we already confirmed was okay. The switch despite the multiple conversations we previously had is what is upsetting to me and making me consider going with our elopement idea we stopped entertaining because they wanted to be involved. I didn't rage at them or threaten anything, I just wanted opinions on whether we should do what we wanted to before or if we should just say fuck it and make the best of getting married with no family. The tearing down and assumptions at my character is a little wild to me but it's the internet, whatever.", "You're right and I never thought either of those things, I would never assume everyone needs to stop for me, that's not how the world works. The other brother said yes and the mom said well it depends on the dog... Out of our six family members we are inviting, three possibly cannot come despite confirming previously and two of my three haven't confirmed yet so with those numbers, it posed the question of whether we should still do this or not.", "Please read. I know all that takes more time... Obviously. I'm only speaking about day of ceremony and reception. We have other kid related events planned surrounding that single day and our house is their house for the time being.", "That's all we are trying to decide between, thank you. They didn't consider that option, or even say alright we have some figuring oitt to do in the next ten months (and by the time it happens, two years) they just straight switched which made us start to question which route we want to go with.", "Yep... Know that as well, I can't marry myself. He is on the same page and we are all discussing this together, and we both are debating between eloping and taking a dope trip or going through with the wedding.", "Yes, all still valid a year and two months ago when I asked and they confirmed. It is also a big expense for us to fly to Florida and Uber to their house every couple months because we do understand it's easier for us to travel, even tho we take off work with no PTO and leave our animals behind as well. I understand all these things, which is why I asked and planned my wedding according to what is easier so they could attend.", "I didn't have any expectations, I planned what I planned accordingly to what I confirmed they were okay with. Just wanted to say, in case you didn't read that part.", "Two years.", "I see that for sure. I want to clarify I'm not threatening to cancel the wedding, I said I wanted to see what the options were for refunds so we can weigh all our options with the new situation at hand. Thank you.", "INFO: You said 3 family members from EACH side attending\u2026now you\u2019re completely contradicting yourself saying \u201cI have no family of my own\u201d\u2026regardless of what\u2019s true, do you understand how this looks extremely dishonest and an attempt to gane sympathy because you\u2019re not getting the cheers you were hoping for?", "Yeah I immediately thought \u201cThat\u2019s totally your choice if you want a kid free wedding\u2026it\u2019s also the guest\u2019s choice whether they show or not.\u201d", "It\u2019s very generous to allow children to enter the same city as you.

You don't get to get worked up even people don't come because of that", "Do you not understand that the fact that the person your SIL trusted to watch her INFANT can\u2019t come is a big hurdle for them? You are clearly not a mother, moms don\u2019t want to leave their nearly newborn with a rando. Even for 6 hours.", "> say fuck it and make the best of getting married with no family. \n\nI'm a little confused about who all is/isn't coming. In the OP you mention 3 family members from each side, so you still have your three family members and one of his right? \n\n> It's unfortunate we might not make it but at least you'll have FMIL and FBIL there\n\nare both BIL and SIL staying home or just SIL, is there a different BIL involved?\n\nEither way it doesn't sound like you'll have *no* family there.\n\nAlso from your post, what changed here is their planned sitter (SIL's mom) can no longer come.", "Ever have a baby start to scream during the ceremony? Ever watch a child purposefully pour Dr. Pepper on a bridesmaid dressed in blush pink? Ever see two young siblings get in an all out cake throwing war during the reception? Cause I\u2019ve seen each one happen.", "This still makes absolutely no sense. It's your fucking wedding.  Whether you should do it or not should be about whether YOU WANT TO OR NOT.\n\nIf you and your fianc\u00e9 had calmly decided, \"you know what? At this point we may just be happier doing it a different way,\" then that would be fine. Get married how you want to. You're the asshole because you're throwing a temper tantrum and threatening to cancel the wedding to spite other people, guilt trip them, and become a martyr.", "Oh, I see.  So, you want them to fly there and pay for the ticket of another adult plus another hotel room.  Would I do that for my sister?  I would, in a heartbeat and we have not talked in.... 2 years.  I would bring my mil with me.  But, I am blessed to be able to do that.  She's retired and I trust her 100%.    That's a hard ask, not everyone knows someone who would give up time off or knows someone who is retired.", "I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just crappy they are acting like their hands are tied.", "Where are you getting that the family members didn't want them to elope? OP says that THEY decided against elopement because they decided they wanted their families involved.", "She had childcare lined up - life happened and that fell through. Do you really not understand why that\u2019s unreasonable to be upset about?\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but it is not your place to volunteer her brother to watch her kids.\n\nI know it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re clearly disappointed that a couple of people may not be able to make it, but you\u2019re entirely out of line and lashing out and, yes, behaving childishly.", "But you keep forgetting that their plan for trusted childcare - which involved the not inconsiderable cost of flying FSIL's mother to Colorado - had to be scuttled because the mother's husband is sick and she needs to be in Florida to care for him.  They were onboard and had made plans but life interfered.  So plans need to be changed.  And the only person not coming is FSIL.  Your FBIL and FMIL are still planning to come.  You sound amazingly entitled.  YTA", "And then her mom\u2019s husband got sick so her mom can\u2019t come. She didn\u2019t bail on you. Things changed to it no longer worked for her.

I just couldn\u2019t really leave him with strangers and it wasn\u2019t reasonable to leave him with friends, who were mostly strangers to him.

Can\u2019t imagine doing it with a newborn.", "I'm not threatening anything, we just need to look into all options now that the situation surprisingly changed. I'm not looking to see if I'm right, if I'm justified, I just wanted to post to see other views I may not be thinking of in the moment when considering trying to get refunds or keep everything as is. If I posted only certain things it would've been \"fucking stupid OP info info info\" so I included what happened and what we are now trying to decide between.", "Yep, it would. Since they would not be left states behind, I was saying the only time they would be without their kids is an estimated time of 6 hours for the ceremony and reception, and we would all be home together again right after like we were right before. Which they said would be fine before we made a $14k commitment.", "I didn't say I wasn't understanding anything, I explained what is making me rethink our plans for our wedding and trying to weigh opinions I may have not thought about yet regarding what to do with the new situation we have on our hands. Thank you", "Oh, we tried to have my parents babysit our 3 month old for a few hours while we were at a wedding in their hometown. They stayed in our hotel room which happened to have a window overlooking the outdoor venue. The window was open and I could hear my poor baby screaming bloody murder because she was EBF and didn\u2019t want a bottle from a virtual stranger. \n\nWe had to fly there and buy her an airplane seat for her car seat. \n\nIt was NOT worth it. We were supposed to fly back for a second wedding a few months later and I called the bride that weekend and explained we could not do it.", "None of this changes anything I said. Why would you be or not be \"right\" or \"justified\"? It's your wedding. If you want to get married at the gas station then do whatever the hell you want.

That internet strangers can tell you what you want?", "Small kids are often unwilling to be watched by strangers. A one year old could absolutely spend the entire time in a terrified, screaming meltdown if left with a total stranger. I would never have left my kids at that age with someone they didn't know.
