It's unfortunate we might not make it but at least you'll have FMIL and FBIL there.\"\n\n... They don't have a single human on earth that they trust enough to watch their kids for about 6 hours, they don't want to try to start to trust someone over the next 10 months, they are concerned who will watch their combined three dogs, and that's the fucking issue right now. She has known this since the day we got engaged, we all talked about it when we went down to celebrate our engagement, and she and I have texted about it two to three times and it wasn't an issue like it is right now. It's not an out of state birthday party or something, we're getting married. We thought about eloping and taking a nice trip but we wanted to celebrate with our families. Since half of them aren't coming, I feel like we should cancel and elope. \n\nHer plan was to bring her mom and have her watch the kids but now her mom's husband is sick so she might not want to so now but her message mentioned cost as a huge factor so I'm not sure exactly what the actual reason is.

An invite isn\u2019t a summons.", "Info please explain the idea of them finding someone to watch their kids for only 6 hours but the wedding is thousands of miles away. Are you expecting them to start trusting someone, then leave their kids for a few days with the person to fly to Colorado or do you expect them to fly this trusted person to Colorado as well for the wedding", "YTA. Sometimes childfree weddings mean that family members with kids can't make it. There's nothing wrong with having one, but you *must* be understanding that it makes things difficult for parents.", "YTA. \n\nI'm sure they do have people they can trust with their kids for 6 hours.  *In Florida.*  The wedding is in Colorado.  You can make whatever rules you want for your wedding, but you don't get to demand that everyone invited has to just figure it out.", "Listen you made the choice of kid free which means some people may not come. Just because people are playing by your rules and you don\u2019t like it you can\u2019t be annoyed at them. If her not going means you want to elope talk to your partner and get their thoughts. This seems borderline bridezilla behavior", "Yea, YTA. It\u2019s fine you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding, that\u2019s your right.\n\nThat said, you are dismissing very valid concerns over cost and care of both their animals and their children. You\u2019re acting like it\u2019s some huge issue that they don\u2019t want to trust people with their children. Frankly, they should be careful with who they trust because terrible things can happen if they\u2019re not. They also don\u2019t live in your state, how are they supposed to find people they trust? Bring someone with them from home? That adds more cost in flights, hotels, travel in general because they\u2019d have to pay for them the whole time not just for the wedding. That\u2019s a ton of extra cost, which you don\u2019t seem to take into consideration. \n\nYou wanting to cancel the wedding over this is a definite overreaction. If you don\u2019t want a wedding and want to elope, fine. Again, your wedding your choice.

If you want a child free wedding, that\u2019s fine; but you need to know that people with kids may not be able to make it.", "YTA... Its your wedding, why cancel the day because of two people. Just enjoy the day with the people who want to show up for you. Also anyone who decides to have a child free wedding should accept that some people won't be able to make it for that exact reason. Don't take everything so personally.", "YTA. They're not demanding that you accept their children at the wedding.  They're not being dramatic or petty about it.  They're basically just sending their regrets and saying,  \"Sorry.  Don't think we can make it.\" My brother and his wife didn't make it to my wedding because of college finals.  People have lives,  they're not being dramatic about it.  And you're considering calling off the wedding because one couple is not willing to drop everything and pay tons of money and then have their kids be all grumpy about traveling when they're not even invited.  Wow. Chillax", "YTA You want a child free wedding and that is what you should have however you can\u2019t be upset if those with kids decide not to attend.

And that's OK!\n\n\nIf they say they can't attend that's also OK....\n\n\nYou can't demand a child free wedding and be annoyed that people with kids say that sorry they can't attend!\n\nYTA", "YTA\nI\u2019ve skipped child-free weddings. People forget that it\u2019s likely that a couple\u2019s entire roster of babysitters will also be at the wedding.\n\nChild-free weddings suck.", "YTA.  Don't be so dramatic. \n\n You don't want kids at your wedding: that's your prerogative. Your BIL and SIL don't feel comfortable with spending beaucoup bucks on airfare and finding someone to watch their child and tiny infant: that's their prerogative.  Their primary priority *should* be their children, and you will have to learn to accept it. \n\n You may be living a childfree life, but you cannot control the lives of the people around you.  Many of them will have kids, and you will have to learn to be okay with not being the most important person in the room to them.\n\n Just behave like an adult and continue to have your wedding with your friends as guests.  Cancelling it is throwing a hissy fit.", "YTA - You are overreacting.  Take a deep breath.  This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, and the commitment you are making to share your lives with each other.  If his family is unable to attend, that is sad, it does not stop you from getting married.  \n\nYou need to understand that this trip will cost several thousand dollars for them to come and visit.  Boarding 3 dogs for a week will run close to $1000.  Plane tickets for the brother, his wife, their 2 kids, and her mother will probably be over $2000.  Then there's the rental car and hotels.\n\nAnd realize that if her mom can't come, even if you hire a **professional** babysitter for them, they may not be comfortable leaving their (very young) kids with a stranger for the day.\n\nAgain, them not being able to attend does not mean you can't get married.  Maybe look into having a live stream of the wedding, that got very popular a couple years ago.  You having a tantrum and threatening to cancel your wedding because it won't all work out perfectly is not the way to go.", "YTA.   Don't be ridiculous.     You're acting like a spoilt little child threatening to take her ball and go home just because another kid played differently than she wanted.     \n\n\nPro tip: the VAST majority of responsible parents are not going to leave their children with a sitter they don't know.    And even if they get a trusted family sitter in the intervening ten months, they're not going to leave the children overnight.      Their plan, to have close family do the sitting, won't pan out.    \n\n\nBoarding dogs is insanely expensive.  Plane tickets for four to six people is insanely expensive.   Professional child care is insanely expensive.   Adding up all of this, my guess is they'd be looking at 6-7 grand just to come. That simply may not be realistic.   \n\n\nAs AITA is fond of saying it's an invitation, not a summons.      You are well within your rights to have a child free wedding.  They are well within their rights to say that that kind of trip is completely unrealistic for them right now.   Grow up.", "A child-free wedding is your choice and a valid one. That's cool. But you're asking people to leave young children behind and fly 4-5 hours away where, in case of an emergency, there's no way they'll be able to respond quickly. \n\nYour words are a little too petulant and entitled - if you don't have kids, you don't get to tell people that they should feel totally fine travelling a 4 hour flight away from them. What exactly is going through your head that you think that's a reasonable expectation? If something happened to their child, it won't be your life that's impacted.\n\nYour wedding, you choice...and their choice to attend or not attend. Humbly accept that given the distance, given the child-free requirement and so forth, some people will be absent.", "YTA- your expectation that parents are going to leave their children - especially those who are still babies and/or nursing. It is unrealistic. If you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding and reception- that\u2019s fine- but there are parents that won\u2019t be willing to make that trip. \n\nAt some family weddings I went to that were child free- the parents teamed up to corral all the cousins at a house and rotated on child care duties. The kids had a blast. But we were not far from home so there was an advantage there. We also had family-friendly stuff the day before and after - and the parents didn\u2019t mind not having the kids at the ceremony and reception. They were relieved to have a little time away knowing their kids were well looked after. Maybe ask if you did something like this if it would change their answers.\n\nAlso- how does your husband to be feel about these people skipping out on his wedding?", "YTA. People have responsibilities outside your wedding. Dogs are a responsibility no matter whether you think it is or not. Kids are a major responsibility and yes, you can't just leave them with anyone. Have you not watched any true crime show? Have you not seen how many lax let sitters don't do their jobs properly? Even the pet sitter we used when we got married did a shoddy job and she was highly recommended.\n\nIt's still 10 months away and even if they can't be there in person, there's no reason why you can enjoy yourselves. Have a live stream for those who can't make it. You've given them the notice, if they can't make it they can't make it but don't spite yourself and your fiance and the rest of the family for it \n.", "YTA - I get that you\u2019re frustrated; however cancelling the wedding seems an extreme reaction when all they\u2019ve done is rudely voice their concerns over the cost and arrangements.  You may have talked about it before, but I guarantee it didn\u2019t register until they started actually making plans.  \n\nIt is expensive to travel and it is difficult to find someone trusted to dog sit, let alone babysit.  These are not your worries though, and the more appropriate reaction would be to convey your understanding of the difficulties and regret if they are unable to attend. \n\nNot saying your hurt and anger aren\u2019t valid, but try to look at the whole picture, not just your close-up.  I would have gone with E S H but your dismissal of their valid concerns and extreme overreaction to cancel landed you in a h territory.  You can\u2019t expect people to see if from your point of view when you\u2019re dismissing/belittling theirs.", "When you have you have your own 4 month old you may get it better.\n\nI think you may be buying a bit too much into it being your day.   The more impediments you put on things, the more people are going to bail.  You can't say you want to spend it with your family... but then tell them to leave their kids behind.  Nope.\n\nOh, and your burning bridges that will remain burnt for a long time in the future.\n\nStop thinking about you, fix some fences and put up with a crying baby or two.", "YTA. You're absolutely allowed to have a child free wedding.  But then you need to accept that not everyone can make it.  You're talking about the cost of airfare for the whole family, hotel, sitter, etc.  And I wouldn't want to have a stranger watch my infant, either.", "YTA. Travel, boarding pets, and childcare are all expensive. You expect her to start looking for someone to trust to watch her kids in a completely different state??? If she can\u2019t make it she can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s an invitation and by saying no kids (completely your choice) you have to understand there will be people that\u2019s can\u2019t make it. Stop overreacting.", "When you have a child free wedding, you have to accept that some people can\u2019t go, like they have to accept they can\u2019t bring their kids. You can feel how you feel about it but that\u2019s a consequence not allowing kids.", "YTA. Any one is entitled to have a child free wedding. That being said, any parent is entitled to not go to said wedding. I don\u2019t trust anyone with my daughter hardly (I was abused as a child by a close family member). No wedding is worth that risk to me.", "YTA, chill out bridezilla.", "YTA. You are entirely within your rights to make the wedding childfree. But part of what that will mean is that some families will decline their invitations. That is *their* right, and you're throwing a tantrum because they chose a course of action which they have just as much right to choose as you have to choose a childfree wedding in the first place. \n\nAnyone and everyone has the right to refuse an invitation. Any invitation. For any reason or none at all. If you're not mature enough to be comfortable with someone saying no to you, then you're not mature enough to get married.", "YTA. I think you're overreacting.  It's hard for people to arrange childcare, dog care etc. You have the right to a childfree wedding, they have the right to decline your invitation. Have fun it's your day, but you can't force people to attend.", "YTA - They can't make it work. They don't feel comfortable leaving their very little kids and travelling thousands of miles (and paying probably thousands of dollars to a sitter) and leaving them behind and they probably don't know anyone close to the venue to watch them. She was willing to go to the significant expense of brining her mother along with the kids but that's not going to work now because of a family illness. She tells you that there are just too many logistical and financial obstacles for her to be able to come to your wedding, despite the fact that she was willing to commit a pretty fair amount of money to trying to come to the wedding, the two of them are 4% of your overall allotted 50 guests and when she tells you you can't make it your reaction is \"I'LL CANCEL THE WHOLE WEDDING!\" yeah you're being dramatic, and spoiled.", "YTA - I\u2019m all for child-free weddings. But, come on. Surely you know that when you have a child-free wedding, there will be some people\u2026.even people who are close to you\u2026who will not attend due to child care or because they just don\u2019t want to go to an event without their children. In fact, a minimum requirement for a bride and groom who want a childfree wedding is to be okay with this reality. This cannot be news to you.", "YTA.  Take a deep breath.  It\u2019s one day.  You\u2019ll still be married afterwards no matter who attends.  Asking guests with kids to travel for a child-free wedding is a lot - they\u2019ll have to find a babysitter at the location or else have someone watch the kids for multiple days at home.  Especially if the children are very young, that\u2019s expensive and stressful.  If it is really important to you to be surrounded by family, include the kids.  If it is most important to you to have a perfectly choreographed wedding with no crying babies, then understand that you\u2019ve made your wedding unwelcoming to parents.", "YTA. Other people have lives and their own concerns.

If you ended up cancelling the wedding and they found out why, they might find it a slap in the face that the determine factor that your wedding was going to happen was because of 2 people. Ultimately, it's your decision. But I'd also think long and hard before pulling the plug on the wedding.", "NAH. Weddings can be expensive for guests, especially child-free weddings. Travel, babysitters, dog sitters, gift. The day will be stressful and not fun for them. Maybe when you texted her about it before she didn\u2019t really think it through. Now she has, and realises it\u2019s going to be expensive and difficult. Her kids are young.\n\nWhether you go ahead with the wedding is up to you, but I don\u2019t think you can be mad if someone is telling you they can\u2019t go this far ahead. I get why you\u2019re disappointed. I would go with the elope option if I were you, or just have your parents and a couple of close friends. You can opt for a child-free wedding, but you can\u2019t get annoyed when people decline to come.\n\nEdit: updated to YTA. Your SIL has told you they are not coming, and why. It would be expensive and stressful for her. Do you want to make people come even if they would be unhappy? Accept her decision gracefully and decide what you want to do about your wedding.", "There's been quite the bunch of wedding posts. Childfree weddings are very reasonable, but you have to understand that it'll limit some people from traveling.

NTA if you want to cancel your wedding, because it's what you want to do, but you'd be the asshole if you got super angry toward this part of the family for not being able to make it. Either they can't or don't want to make it; those are not unreasonable things.", "ESH, but you especially. Inlaws suck for pressuring you on the no kids thing, and you suck for 1.)

Yes, they should have been more gracious about it, but mom staying behind with the kids while everyone else attends is a reasonable compromise. And your reaction to this reasonable compromise is... to want to cancel the wedding?! Holy mother of overreactions. Yes, that is very dramatic and uncalled for.

At that point it's better than no wedding at all.\n\nYTA.", "Me me me me attitude. \n\nYou want a child free wedding then don't complain when parents don't attend. They have the right to say get lost when you do this because they choose to spend the time with their kids. As a parent that's normal.\n\nYou clearly don't have kids, probably shouldn't either of you think dumping a child on a stranger for a screaming bridezilla to get her way is a good idea. \n\nYTA.", "NTA\n\nBut don't let other people's pettiness ruin your day. \n\nWeddings suck because a lot of times guests make it more about themselves than the couple. You can just live with that knowledge, or truly cut bait and elope. Just know that either way, you only get that day once. Make it what you want, not what others do.", "NTA. Well, cancelling the whole wedding over that would be a bit over the top. Have your wedding, and enjoy whoever shows up. Obviously your MIL wants you to have the wedding her way: close to her home, kids and animals welcome. If you relent on the \"kid-free\" thing (which is a bit silly) she won't come anyway, since she's already also cited cost and her dogs. Some folks hate going anywhere, and you're about to be related to some. However, dealing with his family is your fiance's job: get him on it, and relax.", "Cancel and elope. If you wanna give people a heads up, they can meet you at the beach, mountaintop, drive thru Vegas wedding chapel, or courthouse of your choice. And if they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, well, then, they just miss out. \n\nYou can\u2019t be responsible for people\u2019s children, dogs, airplane tickets or anything else. If they are adults and they wanna go, then they can *figure it out* without involving *you*. NTA", "ESH\n\nI don't like kids, don't want them, don't want anything to do with them. I lucked out on my \"very small wedding\" (10 people) and no one brought kids. Well only my friend had one everyone else was childless. I still think you should have considered the feeling of the people with kids. Especially if they're like my friend who left her bf to babysit (she's a waitress and lives paycheck to paycheck). \n\nYour guests are also assholes being passive aggressive.\n\nUltimately though it's about you and your future husband. If not having half of your family there is cool with you guys then who cares. If you do care you might want to rethink the child free wedding.", "[deleted]", "Enough drama and angst from your family. I would elope too. Life is just too short. Any flack, tefer to sll the bs being dumpted on you. Good luck !", "If you don't have any family and his family is stuck in kid mode and are probably financially stressed why not do a Floriday destination wedding?  Floriday is nice if you don't have to live there.", "Elope.  Just elope.\n\nNTA\n\nBut seriously, elope.", "We eloped. 10/10. Would do it again.", "Yes an invitation is not a summons, however we have all spoken about this multiple times with excitement over the past year and two months with no concern about being kid-free. We are offering them a place to stay, we are offering help with child-care options, and they know I have no family of my own so I have been very excited to have them with us and to become a part of their family. It feels like the dogs and the inconvenience of them even being open to the idea of someone else's eyes on their kids for a few hours is taking priority over us and that hurts and makes me want to just celebrate just us two and take a cool trip.", "Exactly, and this is what comes along with a child-free wedding.  It's OPs choice to have no kids, and for parents, especially if there is travel involved, they may choose not to come because.  OP is the AH for now throwing a tantrum and threatening to cancel the entire wedding.  So dramatic!", "I agree completely. It sounds as if the OP is throwing a tantrum because his brother and sister-in-law aren't willing to drop absolutely everything and travel across the country for this.  Shrugging off their concern about their kids and dogs is honestly pretty inconsiderate and self-centred. Nobody is obligated to attend a wedding -- least of all when there are extenuating life circumstances complicating things.", "I think that's what gets me the most. The cost/stress of traveling with kids for them to be with a stranger for that time and not even enjoy what they are traveling for!! Or leave them in florida with someone and in the case of emergency be across the country ??? also what if mom is BF the 4 month old??? she literally couldn't leave her child for that long", "I know it is cultural, but child free weddings is a wild concept for me.\nKids are part of the family and part of the celebration as well, it is sound so boring without it.\n\nAnd I am child free person.", "Also \"She knew about this more than a year ago.\" The younger child is 4 months old.  So...presumably didn't exist even in utero more than a year ago.  If it existed,  may not have consciously existed.", "I'd like to know how exactly I'm being a bridezilla. I picked a cheap venue with an all included package, I'm not picking specific colors or dress code, no gifts, I don't even have a bridal party. I put on the website for whoever to bring their kids for the trip, just ceremony and reception is kid-free and we will help find child care if needed. Your useless comment has no base.", "Because they're close family.  I feel like if a sibling can't make a wedding,  they need to give an actual explanation. Not just a vague \"Sorry,  can't make it.\" That's cold and rude for a sibling.", "what that's not even the problem?? they are fine with not going, it's OP that has the problem that they aren't and are upset that SIL and Brother are not prioritizing her", "I'm really confused with all the responses saying they're being passive-aggressive.  They aren't sure they can make it.  They're not settled,  but they have serious doubts about making it.  They said that.  How is that passive-aggressive?", "None of these are petty reasons. Boarding 3 dogs, flying, and the cost of a baby sister are genuine concerns.", "They\u2019re not petty reasons though.", "i hate to tell you but their kids are above you on their list of priorities. You should definitely have the wedding you want but it sounds like if it matters that much to you for them to be there the kids are going to have to come. Its kind of strange you would rather cancel the whole wedding and literally lose out money rather than letting two kids, your family you care so much about coming ??? it seems like you're mainly mad you aren't their #1 concern in this situation", "Sorry, you don\u2019t get to decide how other people feel about leaving their children with someone else. Your SIL\u2019s youngest child is only 4mo. I\u2019m guessing that they didn\u2019t realise how they would feel about it until now. Either way, they\u2019ve told you their decision now.", "But like...why would you cancel the whole wedding because one or two people aren't coming?", "And this is what I think the Y T A and E S H responses are missing.\n\nThis is not the brother and sil expressing regrets that they can't come or that only brother can attend. This is them trying to guilt you into allowing their kids to attend... when they've been told what the plan is for months.\n\nI do think you're overreacting by wanting to just cancel everything because they're being self-centered. But I won't judge you for it.\n\nBest thing to do. Stop. Take some deep breaths. If you can, put the whole matter aside for a little while.\n\nThen, when you come back to it, sit down with your fianc\u00e9 to compose a \"We'll miss you, but we understand if the cost and arrangements needed for you to attend will be prohibative.\" type message. That your fianc\u00e9 should be the one to send.\n\nThen continue to repeat variations of that same message every time they try to bring it up. Don't argue, don't discuss or persuade. Just repeat the same message and change the topic. Don't even change it to something wedding related. Change it completely. Sportsball. The weather. The farm report. The farm sportsball weather report.\n\nThe only reason to even engage on the topic is if they have a change of heart and want help making arrangements for them being able to attend in accordance with the ceremony you have planned. Short of that, there is nothing to discuss.", "Someone has a very valid conflict and you say, \"Fine then! The wedding is cancelled. Hope you're happy!\" You're a bridezilla. It's not about the complexity of the wedding.  It's about your \"me-me-me\" attitude.", "Because your party is not more important than there kids to anyone but you", "If the weddings child free, how are you going to be able to attend?", "I wouldn\u2019t leave my 14mo and 4yo with a stranger for 6 hours, no matter how well vetted. How will they get to know the sitter if they\u2019re in a different state? You don\u2019t realise it, but you\u2019re asking a lot. This is going to be expensive and stressful for your SIL. She\u2019s thought about it, and decided she can\u2019t do it. You have to accept that. You can either go ahead with the people you have, or not. That\u2019s up to you, but it\u2019s not your SIL\u2019s fault. As others have said, an invitation is not a summons.", "The term Bridezilla has nothing to do with money or cost and everything to do with the bride thinking they can control everyone else, you know, like by threatening to cancel an entire wedding because 2 people expressed concern about cost.", "You're a bridezilla because you're canceling a wedding over a few people.  Bridezilla's absolutely overreact and have tantrums when things don't go their way.  Your reaction is childish.  People have lives outside of weddings, it's not the most important thing for a lot of guests.", "Because you don\u2019t accept they rather stay with the kids and pets than attend your wedding.", "LOL I wouldn\u2019t want to leave my son with a stranger in a different state", "I am upset because we were going to have a destination wedding in Mexico, but they wouldn't have been able to make that trip so we made it for Colorado. They were a part of that decision. If they let us know this was going to be an issue any of the 4-5 times we previously spoke about it then we would have went with eloping and celebrating with them later. Instead, they said that would be okay and they could make it work so we spent $14k on a venue and the all included package, setting that in stone. I don't know why getting the Save The Date triggered a complete change but I wish I knew beforehand because we would have done something completely different if it didn't work for them. Her mom was going to come and she also has a brother here in Colorado. Both of my parents are non existent, I only have one half sister in Tennessee and  two aunts in Ohio. I expressed how happy and excited I was to join their family and they knew my motivation was having them there with us. All of a sudden it's a problem and that is what is upsetting me, it has nothing to do with celebratingggg meeee~~~~. I'm not that person. I'm not threatening them because I'm not getting my way, I just am shocked and upset over the change and the money we already spent in order to do what they said they could swing.", "I find the dog comment pretty passive aggressive. I think if they are willing to say that then it\u2019s worth questioning the tone for everything else.", "I don't think they're trying to change the child policy.  I don't get that vibe at all. Just that with the no-child policy,  them both attending isn't a tenable plan.", "How are they guilting OP?? They said they are not okay with strangers watching their children, and said they would probably  not  be coming and OP is the one coming up with ideas that the couple never agreed too.", "Right??? we aren't even letting my 3month old grandparents watch her until she can recognize them and understands they are her people. Would she be okay if we did? yeah probably. But i cant stomach knowing my baby will be in distress for hours because we essentially left her with strangers (in her mind at least). I cant imagine how stressful it would be to travel with children and do all that work for them to sit with a stranger ????", "I'm also not going to pay to fly my kids out to be babysat by a stranger, either.", "question- was SIL pregnant when they agreed?? and how recently before the save the date went out did you guys talk about it? More info needs to be in your post OP!! Also can i just ask why you are against letting their kids come?? I just think it's hard for me to understand that you care so much about being apart of their family but excluding their kids, who are also your family ???", "If it\u2019s really that important to you to have them there, why not just let their kids come?", "I didn't find that passive-aggressive at all--it's a way of saying, \"We want to go, but there are logistics.\"  I guess I just read it differently.", "Fair enough! That\u2019s what\u2019s always so interesting is how everyone responds differently. If they had just said the logistics are tough with the kids and left it at that I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice. The kid part I totally get but why even say they \u201chope they can find a dog sitter\u201d?I can\u2019t imagine saying that to a bride (or anyone hosting a party) 10 months out from an event, like there\u2019s time to get that sorted and is that even the real issue here? Obviously OP is relaying this all and she\u2019s upset so there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019s not being accurate with their words but the comment on it\u2019s own comes off badly."]}
