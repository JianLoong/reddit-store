Or so I thought...\n\nSince we got engaged a year and almost 2 months ago now, we have always said the ceremony and reception are going to be kid-free. His mom, brother, and sister in law (with their 3yo and 4 month old) live in South FL and we live in Colorado. His family received the Save The Dates this week and all we have heard is, \"I hope we can find someone to watch the dogs so we can go\" and I mf quote \"That's asking us to leave our kids with a stranger for several hours not a few; no amount of time really remedies that. It's also a huge expense for us to travel all that way (kids don't fly free) to have three of us not be able to even attend. It's unfortunate we might not make it but at least you'll have FMIL and FBIL there.\"\n\n... They don't have a single human on earth that they trust enough to watch their kids for about 6 hours, they don't want to try to start to trust someone over the next 10 months, they are concerned who will watch their combined three dogs, and that's the fucking issue right now. She has known this since the day we got engaged, we all talked about it when we went down to celebrate our engagement, and she and I have texted about it two to three times and it wasn't an issue like it is right now. It's not an out of state birthday party or something, we're getting married. We thought about eloping and taking a nice trip but we wanted to celebrate with our families. Since half of them aren't coming, I feel like we should cancel and elope. \n\nHer plan was to bring her mom and have her watch the kids but now her mom's husband is sick so she might not want to so now but her message mentioned cost as a huge factor so I'm not sure exactly what the actual reason is. His SIL said \"omg lol don't be dramatic\" about me saying I'll look into getting a refund for whatever we paid for this far. I may be the asshole by cancelling everything and losing out on some of the money we already paid for reserving stuff and I would have to contact everyone else and say jk nvm, no wedding.

An invite isn\u2019t a summons.", "Info please explain the idea of them finding someone to watch their kids for only 6 hours but the wedding is thousands of miles away. Are you expecting them to start trusting someone, then leave their kids for a few days with the person to fly to Colorado or do you expect them to fly this trusted person to Colorado as well for the wedding", "YTA. Sometimes childfree weddings mean that family members with kids can't make it. There's nothing wrong with having one, but you *must* be understanding that it makes things difficult for parents.", "YTA. \n\nI'm sure they do have people they can trust with their kids for 6 hours.  *In Florida.*  The wedding is in Colorado.  You can make whatever rules you want for your wedding, but you don't get to demand that everyone invited has to just figure it out.", "Listen you made the choice of kid free which means some people may not come. Just because people are playing by your rules and you don\u2019t like it you can\u2019t be annoyed at them. If her not going means you want to elope talk to your partner and get their thoughts. This seems borderline bridezilla behavior", "Yea, YTA. It\u2019s fine you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding, that\u2019s your right.\n\nThat said, you are dismissing very valid concerns over cost and care of both their animals and their children. You\u2019re acting like it\u2019s some huge issue that they don\u2019t want to trust people with their children. Frankly, they should be careful with who they trust because terrible things can happen if they\u2019re not. They also don\u2019t live in your state, how are they supposed to find people they trust? Bring someone with them from home? That adds more cost in flights, hotels, travel in general because they\u2019d have to pay for them the whole time not just for the wedding. That\u2019s a ton of extra cost, which you don\u2019t seem to take into consideration. \n\nYou wanting to cancel the wedding over this is a definite overreaction. If you don\u2019t want a wedding and want to elope, fine. Again, your wedding your choice.

If you want a child free wedding, that\u2019s fine; but you need to know that people with kids may not be able to make it.", "YTA... Its your wedding, why cancel the day because of two people. Just enjoy the day with the people who want to show up for you. Also anyone who decides to have a child free wedding should accept that some people won't be able to make it for that exact reason. Don't take everything so personally.", "YTA. They're not demanding that you accept their children at the wedding.  They're not being dramatic or petty about it.  They're basically just sending their regrets and saying,  \"Sorry.  Don't think we can make it.\" My brother and his wife didn't make it to my wedding because of college finals.  People have lives,  they're not being dramatic about it.  And you're considering calling off the wedding because one couple is not willing to drop everything and pay tons of money and then have their kids be all grumpy about traveling when they're not even invited.  Wow. Chillax", "YTA You want a child free wedding and that is what you should have however you can\u2019t be upset if those with kids decide not to attend.

And that's OK!\n\n\nIf they say they can't attend that's also OK....\n\n\nYou can't demand a child free wedding and be annoyed that people with kids say that sorry they can't attend!\n\nYTA", "YTA\nI\u2019ve skipped child-free weddings. People forget that it\u2019s likely that a couple\u2019s entire roster of babysitters will also be at the wedding.\n\nChild-free weddings suck.", "YTA.  Don't be so dramatic. \n\n You don't want kids at your wedding: that's your prerogative. Your BIL and SIL don't feel comfortable with spending beaucoup bucks on airfare and finding someone to watch their child and tiny infant: that's their prerogative.  Their primary priority *should* be their children, and you will have to learn to accept it. \n\n You may be living a childfree life, but you cannot control the lives of the people around you.  Many of them will have kids, and you will have to learn to be okay with not being the most important person in the room to them.\n\n Just behave like an adult and continue to have your wedding with your friends as guests.  Cancelling it is throwing a hissy fit.", "YTA - You are overreacting.  Take a deep breath.  This wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, and the commitment you are making to share your lives with each other.  If his family is unable to attend, that is sad, it does not stop you from getting married.  \n\nYou need to understand that this trip will cost several thousand dollars for them to come and visit.  Boarding 3 dogs for a week will run close to $1000.  Plane tickets for the brother, his wife, their 2 kids, and her mother will probably be over $2000.  Then there's the rental car and hotels.\n\nAnd realize that if her mom can't come, even if you hire a **professional** babysitter for them, they may not be comfortable leaving their (very young) kids with a stranger for the day.\n\nAgain, them not being able to attend does not mean you can't get married.  Maybe look into having a live stream of the wedding, that got very popular a couple years ago.  You having a tantrum and threatening to cancel your wedding because it won't all work out perfectly is not the way to go.", "YTA.   Don't be ridiculous.     You're acting like a spoilt little child threatening to take her ball and go home just because another kid played differently than she wanted.     \n\n\nPro tip: the VAST majority of responsible parents are not going to leave their children with a sitter they don't know.    And even if they get a trusted family sitter in the intervening ten months, they're not going to leave the children overnight.      Their plan, to have close family do the sitting, won't pan out.    \n\n\nBoarding dogs is insanely expensive.  Plane tickets for four to six people is insanely expensive.   Professional child care is insanely expensive.   Adding up all of this, my guess is they'd be looking at 6-7 grand just to come. That simply may not be realistic.   \n\n\nAs AITA is fond of saying it's an invitation, not a summons.      You are well within your rights to have a child free wedding.  They are well within their rights to say that that kind of trip is completely unrealistic for them right now.   Grow up.", "A child-free wedding is your choice and a valid one. That's cool. But you're asking people to leave young children behind and fly 4-5 hours away where, in case of an emergency, there's no way they'll be able to respond quickly. \n\nYour words are a little too petulant and entitled - if you don't have kids, you don't get to tell people that they should feel totally fine travelling a 4 hour flight away from them. What exactly is going through your head that you think that's a reasonable expectation? If something happened to their child, it won't be your life that's impacted.\n\nYour wedding, you choice...and their choice to attend or not attend. Humbly accept that given the distance, given the child-free requirement and so forth, some people will be absent.", "YTA- your expectation that parents are going to leave their children - especially those who are still babies and/or nursing. It is unrealistic. If you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding and reception- that\u2019s fine- but there are parents that won\u2019t be willing to make that trip. \n\nAt some family weddings I went to that were child free- the parents teamed up to corral all the cousins at a house and rotated on child care duties. The kids had a blast. But we were not far from home so there was an advantage there. We also had family-friendly stuff the day before and after - and the parents didn\u2019t mind not having the kids at the ceremony and reception. They were relieved to have a little time away knowing their kids were well looked after. Maybe ask if you did something like this if it would change their answers.\n\nAlso- how does your husband to be feel about these people skipping out on his wedding?", "YTA. People have responsibilities outside your wedding. Dogs are a responsibility no matter whether you think it is or not. Kids are a major responsibility and yes, you can't just leave them with anyone. Have you not watched any true crime show? Have you not seen how many lax let sitters don't do their jobs properly? Even the pet sitter we used when we got married did a shoddy job and she was highly recommended.\n\nIt's still 10 months away and even if they can't be there in person, there's no reason why you can enjoy yourselves. Have a live stream for those who can't make it. You've given them the notice, if they can't make it they can't make it but don't spite yourself and your fiance and the rest of the family for it \n.", "YTA - I get that you\u2019re frustrated; however cancelling the wedding seems an extreme reaction when all they\u2019ve done is rudely voice their concerns over the cost and arrangements.  You may have talked about it before, but I guarantee it didn\u2019t register until they started actually making plans.  \n\nIt is expensive to travel and it is difficult to find someone trusted to dog sit, let alone babysit.  These are not your worries though, and the more appropriate reaction would be to convey your understanding of the difficulties and regret if they are unable to attend. \n\nNot saying your hurt and anger aren\u2019t valid, but try to look at the whole picture, not just your close-up.  I would have gone with E S H but your dismissal of their valid concerns and extreme overreaction to cancel landed you in a h territory.  You can\u2019t expect people to see if from your point of view when you\u2019re dismissing/belittling theirs.", "When you have you have your own 4 month old you may get it better.\n\nI think you may be buying a bit too much into it being your day.   The more impediments you put on things, the more people are going to bail.  You can't say you want to spend it with your family... but then tell them to leave their kids behind.  Nope.\n\nOh, and your burning bridges that will remain burnt for a long time in the future.\n\nStop thinking about you, fix some fences and put up with a crying baby or two.", "YTA. You're absolutely allowed to have a child free wedding.  But then you need to accept that not everyone can make it.  You're talking about the cost of airfare for the whole family, hotel, sitter, etc.  And I wouldn't want to have a stranger watch my infant, either.", "YTA. Travel, boarding pets, and childcare are all expensive. You expect her to start looking for someone to trust to watch her kids in a completely different state??? If she can\u2019t make it she can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s an invitation and by saying no kids (completely your choice) you have to understand there will be people that can\u2019t make it. Stop overreacting.", "When you have a child free wedding, you have to accept that some people can\u2019t go, like they have to accept they can\u2019t bring their kids. You can feel how you feel about it but that\u2019s a consequence not allowing kids.", "YTA. Any one is entitled to have a child free wedding. That being said, any parent is entitled to not go to said wedding. I don\u2019t trust anyone with my daughter hardly (I was abused as a child by a close family member). No wedding is worth that risk to me.", "[removed]", "YTA. You are entirely within your rights to make the wedding childfree. But part of what that will mean is that some families will decline their invitations. That is *their* right, and you're throwing a tantrum because they chose a course of action which they have just as much right to choose as you have to choose a childfree wedding in the first place. \n\nAnyone and everyone has the right to refuse an invitation. Any invitation. For any reason or none at all. If you're not mature enough to be comfortable with someone saying no to you, then you're not mature enough to get married.", "YTA.

Have fun it's your day, but you can't force people to attend.", "YTA - They can't make it work. They don't feel comfortable leaving their very little kids and travelling thousands of miles (and paying probably thousands of dollars to a sitter) and leaving them behind and they probably don't know anyone close to the venue to watch them. She was willing to go to the significant expense of brining her mother along with the kids but that's not going to work now because of a family illness. She tells you that there are just too many logistical and financial obstacles for her to be able to come to your wedding, despite the fact that she was willing to commit a pretty fair amount of money to trying to come to the wedding, the two of them are 4% of your overall allotted 50 guests and when she tells you you can't make it your reaction is \"I'LL CANCEL THE WHOLE WEDDING!\" yeah you're being dramatic, and spoiled.", "YTA - I\u2019m all for child-free weddings. But, come on. Surely you know that when you have a child-free wedding, there will be some people\u2026.even people who are close to you\u2026who will not attend due to child care or because they just don\u2019t want to go to an event without their children.

You\u2019ll still be married afterwards no matter who attends.  Asking guests with kids to travel for a child-free wedding is a lot - they\u2019ll have to find a babysitter at the location or else have someone watch the kids for multiple days at home.  Especially if the children are very young, that\u2019s expensive and stressful.  If it is really important to you to be surrounded by family, include the kids.  If it is most important to you to have a perfectly choreographed wedding with no crying babies, then understand that you\u2019ve made your wedding unwelcoming to parents.", "YTA.

If you ended up cancelling the wedding and they found out why, they might find it a slap in the face that the determine factor that your wedding was going to happen was because of 2 people. Ultimately, it's your decision. But I'd also think long and hard before pulling the plug on the wedding.", "NAH. Weddings can be expensive for guests, especially child-free weddings. Travel, babysitters, dog sitters, gift. The day will be stressful and not fun for them. Maybe when you texted her about it before she didn\u2019t really think it through. Now she has, and realises it\u2019s going to be expensive and difficult. Her kids are young.\n\nWhether you go ahead with the wedding is up to you, but I don\u2019t think you can be mad if someone is telling you they can\u2019t go this far ahead. I get why you\u2019re disappointed. I would go with the elope option if I were you, or just have your parents and a couple of close friends. You can opt for a child-free wedding, but you can\u2019t get annoyed when people decline to come.\n\nEdit: updated to YTA. Your SIL has told you they are not coming, and why.

Accept her decision gracefully and decide what you want to do about your wedding.", "There's been quite the bunch of wedding posts. Childfree weddings are very reasonable, but you have to understand that it'll limit some people from traveling.

NTA if you want to cancel your wedding, because it's what you want to do, but you'd be the asshole if you got super angry toward this part of the family for not being able to make it. Either they can't or don't want to make it; those are not unreasonable things.", "ESH, but you especially. Inlaws suck for pressuring you on the no kids thing, and you suck for 1.)

Yes, they should have been more gracious about it, but mom staying behind with the kids while everyone else attends is a reasonable compromise. And your reaction to this reasonable compromise is... to want to cancel the wedding?! Holy mother of overreactions. Yes, that is very dramatic and uncalled for.

They gave us a hard no about leaving the country for a destination wedding, so we did not go that route. I asked about Colorado and the logistics and they confirmed, which I think is more than other engaged couples would do, so we did what we already confirmed was okay.

Similarly, if you plan a child-free wedding, you have to expect that last-minute crises (and the children's grandmother being unavailable for the foreseeable future IS  a crisis) will keep some of the parents you invited from attending.\n\nWhen you set up restrictive wedding conditions, you have to accept that some people can't meet the restrictions.

Also if you are having a CO wedding in Dec and they are coming from FL they\u2019ll need to buy the entire family winter wear including the kids who will surely only wear the items this one time because they will outgrow them so quickly.

I assure you that there are other, smaller things that family has given up because it wasn't compatible with having small children.\n\nIt is time for you to ask which is most important to you:  having the wedding exactly as you pictured it, or having a different sort of wedding with more people able to attend.

As for the other guests, you could still have a nice wedding with them there but if you are so hyper fixated on whether or not your future BIL/SIL come it sounds like you\u2019ve set yourself up to have a miserable day and are probably better off canceling and doing something that would make you and your fianc\u00e9 happier.", "If their attendance is such a priority to you, why not make an exception and allow their 2 kids to attend the wedding?", "\nOh Bless Your Heart. YTA. I would think a 29 year old would understand that life happens, circumstances change, and even the best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t comprehend that BIL/SIL situation has changed since they originally said they would be able to attend. When originally discussed they believed they were in a good financial situation to attend an out of state wedding and had adequate child care.  However, they now have a second child. SIL\u2019s mother is no longer able to provide what I am assuming was FREE child care for them. \n\nSo they have two options: \n\n1. Try and find a trusted sitter who is willing to give up their plans over the holiday season to come to Colorado and watch the kids. So that is airfare, accommodations, food, and child care for two children for approximately six hours. While you offered your home this hypothetical sitter may not feel comfortable staying in the home of stranger with people she doesn\u2019t know. So yes, accommodations may need to be budgeted for when they had previously not been. \n\n2. Find a sitter in Colorado.  Most parents I know would not feel comfortable hiring a stranger to watch their kids, especially one of whom can\u2019t verbalize their needs.  They would have no opportunity to assess how the kids react to sitter nor give a test run to see how the sitter is this the kids. \nSIL/BIL have determined the neither of these options is viable to them. \n\nThe economy is in flux right now and things are more expansive. You are getting married in Colorado in December.  Which like it or not translates to holiday season and even more  price increases including airfare and boarding services. Having to spend additional money on child care, as well as rising cost have likely made attending a financial burden where is previously hadn\u2019t been. \n\nIf you choose to cancel and elope that is on you but it\u2019s not their fault. Be happy you have the option of changing course if you choose because they were able to let you know 10 months in advance. One can only imagine how insufferable you would be if SIL\u2019s mother or one of the kids got sick before they were supposed to leave FL and they weren\u2019t able to fly out.", "You keep failing to hear that things changed dramatically in their lives since the time they said \"yes, they could come.\"  At the time they said yes, they had one child, not two, and their mom could come along to watch the children.  Now there are two children, one very very young, and the person they trusted to look after the children isn't available.\n\nPeople make promises and then life happens.  You have to adapt to that.  My MIL promised to keep our kids so we could go to France together.  Then she got breast cancer.  Do I regret not going?  Sure.  Do I blame my MIL?  Hell, no.", "The reason it seems unhinged is that from what you wrote, there are 50 people you do want to celebrate with. 1-2 are saying they can\u2019t come, with weird new excuses. \n\nThe unhinged part is changing the plans solely because of those people. If you were planning this wedding purely to celebrate with THEM, then it wouldn\u2019t be odd at all to cancel. Since there are 48 other people you wanted to share in the joy of your commitment to your spouse, it seems out of the blue and impulsive.\n\nAgain, if you guys have been heavily considering canceling and eloping, this being the needle that broke the camels back, by all means elope!! Losing out on deposits is still cheaper than going through with the party.

You want a kid free wedding,  then expect that people with kids might not come.  It is pretty much impossible to find child care in another state that's trustworthy.

Do you seriously expect them to pay for flights and hotel and food and time for a babysitter for an entire weekend to come to a wedding you\u2019re not even inviting your niece and nephew to?", "How do you go about finding a babysitter you know and trust with your kids IN ANOTHER CITY. Even with a head start, that\u2019s a big ask.", "How do you find a sitter *in another state* several hours away by plane???  Answer: you can\u2019t.  Many parents can\u2019t leave a toddler even with grandparents for a weekend when they fly to another state.  This is common. Sure, some can. Many cannot.  If you invite people to a child free wedding who have little kids, often times, they simply cannot come. If all are polite about a refusal, it\u2019s fine.

And then the extra fees....", "You are literally making your own mess. Why is it the end of the world if three people (out of *all* the people you invited) can't come? \n\nMany, MANY people mentioned that things have changed since you first confirmed, to now. And you've very nicely ignored those comments. When the family first confirmed, they had set plans and could do it. LIFE HAPPENED and now they no longer have anything concrete they're comfortable with - and as a mom, I can tell you that I won't let anyone I don't know NEAR my kids with a 50 foot pole. I don't care how much you looked into it. \n\nThen you, in your freak out manner, decided to go nuclear and are debating on tossing out the entire wedding. This is why people are calling you unhinged, and you don't seem to grasp anything you're being told.", "It sounds like you want to make them feel guilty because their circumstances have changed. Your wedding is not more important than their kids. You choose to have a child free wedding, completely fair, but you need to accept sometimes people can't come or circumstances change."]}
