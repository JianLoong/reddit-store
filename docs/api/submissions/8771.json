Nothing wrong, everyone was excited and happy to be there. The problem started when my parents asked us about scuba diving. I myself am scared of open sea, depths and being on a boat. I told my parents that and also told them that because I'm scared of depths and places I can't reach with my feet where my head can be over the water surface I don't wanna scuba dive but I said that I'll survive and overcome my fear staying on the boat. They had no problem with that and accepted it. Few days later they came to me and my siblings announcing that we're going scuba diving (ALL of us). I told them no that I already told them I'm scared. They tried to get me to agree but I didn't. Well when the day we'd be scuba diving came I eventually said that I'd try it, they wouldn't get their money back for me so they at least wanted me to try it. When we were on the boat getting ready to scuba dive I was really stressed. Well the moment I jumped into the water with the heavy oxygen bottle on my back I IMMEDIATELY knew I didn't wanna be there. I tried going underwater but the weight on my back scared me and the moment I went underwater I immediately went back up. I told my mom I wanted out and she and the instructor both tried me to stay there. I was screaming there and crying that I wanna get out. I also hated the fact that until my mom said I can get out they forced me to stay there. My mom tried telling me to do it for her and to be brave and dive with her and repeated herself for about 5 minutes till she gave up and let me come out. When I got out I immediately took of everything and stayed in my swimming suit. I was shaking and trying to stay calm to not cry again. When we all finished diving my parents and siblings made fun of me for being scared. When we got to our room my parents called me and told me that I ruined the diving for them and that I embarrassed them, they also said I ruined the family bonding time and didn't wanna speak to me for the rest of the day.

If something is off, or if you're afraid, etc, you should not dive. \n\nNo one should force you to dive. Certainly not in an open water situation when it sounds like you've never even been trained or anything?\n\nScuba diving can be a really safe, fun activity. I find it very peaceful; the closest I'll ever get to visiting another planet. But you should never be pressured into it. Mistakes or panic at depth can literally kill you.", "Your family is awful. This was manipulative and abusive. You were upfront from the beginning why you were not comfortable and did not want to scuba dive.  That boundary should have been respected immediately.  You even agreed to go the boat which I think is huge.  They kept pushing and manipulating you. Ultimately, they even trapped you and then mocked you repeatedly.  These are not kind people.  \n\nYou did not mention your age.  But I hope you are old enough to go LC at this point.  Good luck.  \n\nNTA but your family is definitely full of them.", "NTA.\n\nI get that sometimes people really want you to experience things with them so they may push you a little after you declined the first time, but after the 2nd and 3rd time they should have left it for sure.\n\nBut you went anyway and fair play to you, you actually tried it. However, after your initial reluctance, they should have expected that you probably won't enjoy your experience. The real AH part of it is them keeping you in the water though.\n\nIf you ruined their experience somehow, then that's on them, not you. They could have still enjoyed it without you, it's nice to get people involved, but if somebody says they don't wanna do it, that's it.", "NTA\n\nWhy on earth did they take you diving when you were terrified of it? That was a really stupid idea.\n\n(As a note, if I was going to dive on vacation, I would always learn to dive at home first.)", "NTA, your parents are emotionally very immature. They ruined this bonding time by having no regards for any boundaries you have. I hope you don't live with these people if this is already triggering to them.\n\nAlso f your mom for trying to keep you in the water, she is such a major AH", "INFO: How old are you?\n\nI'm only asking as in how long till you can get away from your AH family who think it's funny laughing at other people's fears and don't respect your wishes. You embarrased them? Your family is awful, sorry. NTA", "NTA for being scared to go SCUBA diving. I would never do that, personally. I'm not really a water person and I hate the idea of feeling closed in. I'd probably have a panic attack in the water if someone was trying to make me stay there, too.\n\nNext time, though, remember that you are allowed to calmly advocate for yourself. Simply say, \"No, I'm not interested in SCUBA diving. I will be staying at the hotel while you all go.\" And stand your ground. Nothing wrong with that. Or even, \"I'm not interested in SCUBA diving. I'll come sit on the sidelines and watch while you do it, or bring a book.\" Totally fine to do both of these things. Maybe that would avoid a situation where you have a panic attack (which was understandable) because you were pressured into doing something you knew you'd hate.", "INFO: how are you and your family even allowed to do this without getting certified? There\u2019s a whole process for a reason. I guess it might be different in other countries though", "NTA. Also the fastest way scuba diving becomes dangerous is when people panic. People freak, and racing to the surface can cause real damage.", "NTA. Scuba diving while scared could literally kill you. Scuba requires deep and calm breaths. If you're scared you're going to be breathing shallowly and quickly, which leads to you thinking you don't have enough air, which will lead to you panicking underwater since you think you're drowning. If it's everybody's first time you all should have been practicing at some pool-like lagoon or shallow water. \n\nYour family is nuts. And the scuba instructor is nuts for letting someone dive who has numerous phobias related to the water.", "oh boy... NTA.    I will say i find scuba diving traumatizing.   Although they may have thought once you try it, you may like it, but they shouldn't have forced you to do anything you didn't want to do.\n\nI don't like they pinned everything on you.

Too easy.", "NTA - As a parent myself, if I would have got you on the boat so we could at least be \"together\" in that regard, I would have considered it a win.  Just because I don't understand your fear, doesn't mean that I would want to traumatize you or shame you for it.", "NTA. Safety first. Diving isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nAre you even trained/certified?! Are they? And if so, are they certified to TEACH? Cuz it doesn\u2019t sound like it. Doesn\u2019t matter what country you are from\u2014certification is applicable on an international level.\n\nIf you have that kind of fear, your decision-making is impaired. That can get you killed in a diving scenario. You made the right choice. Your family needs to stop\u2014they fail to understand the risk they are putting you at by forcing the issue.\n\nAnd\u2026Where in Egypt were y\u2019all even diving? Cuz if it was the famous blue hole I\u2019m thinking of\u2026it\u2019s considered the most deadly dive location in the world for a reason. That place is proof that ego is the most common cause of death in scuba diving. Just Google Yuri Lipski and you\u2019ll see.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA, your parents sound immature af.", "NTA. I am exactly the same. I love to swim but only if my feet touch. Parents do try to get their kids to do new things. Though at the point you were in tears, they should have backed down.", "You\u2019re NTA abut your parents surely are! You don\u2019t list you age but I\u2019m young. I get they wanted you to try something new and exciting like this but to force you to do and then humiliate you when you were scared to is just absolutely disgusting!! I have the same fear that you do. I love the ocean, would love to try scuba diving but I know I\u2019d be too scared to. The fact of humiliating you and punishing you by not speaking to you the rest of the day like their children is absolutely ridiculous and shitty ass parenting.", "Shees, NTA. I was in Egypt for my honeymoon with my husband. Part of ship trip was snorkeling. He didn't want to go and guess what? I didn't force him to because I'm not a self-centered psycho who pushes people to do what aren't comfortable to do and labels it as bonding time...You made very clear You didn't want to do this multiple times, your family sucks.", "NTA. Don't you usually have to train to SCUBA dive? It shouldn't have been a problem that you didn't want to do it. They could have done it without you and did do it without you. You said as soon as it was mentioned that you didn't want to do it and that should have been the end of it.", "God, I really feel for you. Your family sounds awful. You are definitely NTA.\n\n1) you explained your fears, set boundaries, and even compromised by saying you'd go with them but stay on the boat\n\n2) they bullied you into going past your comfort zone, and you even agreed to try\n\n3) when you decided you'd have enough, your mom continued to bully you when you were in clear distress\n\n4) your family made fun of you for your panic attack.\n\nThese people are not compassionate or supportive. It seems to me that you bent over backwards to be accommodating but they can't offer you a modicum of respect or care. SCUBA diving is not without risks and even experienced divers understand that there is a huge psychological element to safety. The dive instructor really should have stood up for you here. I'm so sorry nobody went to bat for you. You can get hugs at r/momforaminute if you need to process this with kinder family members.", "Very rich of them, first making you do something you excited explained you didn't want to do, then making fun of you and on top accusing you of ruining their day. Scuba diving is great,  many things are great, but not everyone wants to do them, and shouldn't have to. I am sorry your folks behaved like this.", "NTA. I love scuba but also feel it is dangerous. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I felt uncomfortable. I skipped a non refundable dive because I came down with a bad cold and couldn\u2019t breathe well and worried I would have an issue. If I was terrified every time I dove I assume I would create life threatening issues pretty regularly. \nYou set a clear boundary and the family didn\u2019t respect it. That sucks but isn\u2019t your fault", "I din't understand why the dive master even allowed you to get in the water because of your reaction let alone get in the water w/ the equipment. Why didn't they stop your mother?", "NTA. Being terrified of the open sea is very different to being terrified of rollercoasters, for instance. Being afraid won\u2019t kill you on a rollercoaster, but it absolutely can if you are scuba diving.", "NTA!\n\nHowever, I'm calling this a fresh load off manure! You don't just put on the gear (BC, tank, regulator, weights, skinsuit/wetsuit, no suit, mask, fins etc) and jump in the water without going through a bare minimum of training. That training determines if you can safely dive or not.", "NTA.  I hope you learned a lesson from this.  NEVER allow anyone (especially family and friends) to make you do something you don't want to do.  Don't negotiate or change your position.  If the maximum you are willing to do is stay on the bought, then that's what you do.  Don't \"try it\" if you already said no.", "INFO- How old are you? Why did you change your mind and agree to try it when you knew you had a phobia?", "NTA. And as the parent of a child with serious anxiety, I don't understand your parents' reasoning here. I CANNOT imagine scheduling family bonding time on vacation with an activity that one family member is terrified of.\n\n(Please, OP, try to get some counseling for this fear of open water. It might have to wait  until you're on your own, I understand, but do try. I mean, sure, you can probably live your whole life avoiding open water, but why would you? Therapy really can help.)", "With OP's level of fear, if she had continued to try, I can't help but think there would have been a 100% chance of catastrophe.\n\n*fwiw tho i'm terrified of the ocean. i'm an excellent swimmer but as i age i'm more and more afraid of large bodies of water.", "This is what I was thinking. I love scuba diving, and scuba diving in Egypt is supposed to be top tier. However, despite being a popular vacation sport, scuba diving is not without its risks. In fact, it's basically all about managing risks. Which means being calm. Which means not being afraid, and it it especially means not being forced to do it.   \n\n\nThey should have let OP stay on the boat. I'm assuming this was a resort certification type dive and not advanced open water, I bet they'd only be down for 30 minutes tops. OP is definitely NTA.", "Yeah! Imagine what a nice example could have been set if OP's boundaries were respected. It doesn't sound like these parents are emotionally available--their child isn't allowed to express or experience feelings that they don't share or approve of.", "Not only NTA, but also good of you being brave enough to try something despite being scared. I'm sure most of it was pressure, but still, despite all your fears you tried. Double shame on your family, since you were the only grown person in the group.", "That was my question as well. I find it hard to believe that people who have never even put on the equipment before were being thrown into the ocean.", "Egypt is a great diving location, and for a recreational dive (6-12 metres) you don't need to be certified - You just need to be with a certified Diver. \n\nOpen sea is usually a mile or two away from the shore, rather than being 10 miles out or something. \n\nI've done it a couple of times, and even know a couple of non-swimmers who can do recreational dives.", "I was thinking this.\n\nI don't know how deep they are going, but if someone were to panic when they are in deep and try to swim out too quickly it puts them at risk of \"the bends\"\n\nBasically, trying to surface too quickly can cause pockets of air to form in the blood vessels as the pressure decreases. This is not only incredibly painful, but deadly.\n\nNot to mention the plethora of other issues that can occur when someone panics. Scuba diving requires being calm.", "15, I guess I thought I might agree at the last minute since my parents wouldn't get their money back if they canceled for me so I didn't wanna waste their money", "Not the ocean, the Red Sea!", "Oh interesting. The few places that I\u2019ve been and considered diving I think we needed to be certified or do their certification classes in the pool before ever going into open water. But yeah I do have a pretty limited exposure to it so I guess it is just different in other places. Ill get around to getting certified eventually lol", "That would be entirely, and totally, on them. You were quite clear that you *didn't* want to dive and why, but they went ahead and ignored you. Then, your reward for trying, because they decided they knew best, was to be mocked for being afraid, and to be told that you'd ruined things. You didn't. They did. By not listening to you.\n\nIt really, really, isn't okay that they blamed you, let your siblings mock you, and joined in with making fun of you for being scared. Not only are we all scared of something, and that should be met with empathy, but it isn't right to treat somebody the way you were treated. It's pretty fucked up, honestly. \n\nNTA.", "Awww, kid. I\u2019m sorry you went through this. I get they couldn\u2019t leave you by yourself, but I thought the plan to stay on the boat was a fair one. You didn\u2019t owe them anything. Their money is theirs to waste.\n\nHonestly the next time they bring up this event, tell them it\u2019s something you will be discussing with your therapist when you\u2019re older and walk away. \n\nYou\u2019re not an embarrassment. You ruined nothing. You\u2019re a good kid. NTA."]}
