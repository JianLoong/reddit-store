Nothing wrong, everyone was excited and happy to be there. The problem started when my parents asked us about scuba diving. I myself am scared of open sea, depths and being on a boat. I told my parents that and also told them that because I'm scared of depths and places I can't reach with my feet where my head can be over the water surface I don't wanna scuba dive but I said that I'll survive and overcome my fear staying on the boat. They had no problem with that and accepted it. Few days later they came to me and my siblings announcing that we're going scuba diving (ALL of us). I told them no that I already told them I'm scared. They tried to get me to agree but I didn't. Well when the day we'd be scuba diving came I eventually said that I'd try it, they wouldn't get their money back for me so they at least wanted me to try it. When we were on the boat getting ready to scuba dive I was really stressed. Well the moment I jumped into the water with the heavy oxygen bottle on my back I IMMEDIATELY knew I didn't wanna be there. I tried going underwater but the weight on my back scared me and the moment I went underwater I immediately went back up. I told my mom I wanted out and she and the instructor both tried me to stay there. I was screaming there and crying that I wanna get out. I also hated the fact that until my mom said I can get out they forced me to stay there. My mom tried telling me to do it for her and to be brave and dive with her and repeated herself for about 5 minutes till she gave up and let me come out. When I got out I immediately took of everything and stayed in my swimming suit. I was shaking and trying to stay calm to not cry again. When we all finished diving my parents and siblings made fun of me for being scared. When we got to our room my parents called me and told me that I ruined the diving for them and that I embarrassed them, they also said I ruined the family bonding time and didn't wanna speak to me for the rest of the day.

However, after your initial reluctance, they should have expected that you probably won't enjoy your experience.

I'm not really a water person and I hate the idea of feeling closed in. I'd probably have a panic attack in the water if someone was trying to make me stay there, too.\n\nNext time, though, remember that you are allowed to calmly advocate for yourself. Simply say, \"No, I'm not interested in SCUBA diving. I will be staying at the hotel while you all go.\" And stand your ground. Nothing wrong with that. Or even, \"I'm not interested in SCUBA diving. I'll come sit on the sidelines and watch while you do it, or bring a book.\" Totally fine to do both of these things. Maybe that would avoid a situation where you have a panic attack (which was understandable) because you were pressured into doing something you knew you'd hate.", "INFO: how are you and your family even allowed to do this without getting certified?

Just because I don't understand your fear, doesn't mean that I would want to traumatize you or shame you for it.", "NTA. Safety first. Diving isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\nAre you even trained/certified?! Are they? And if so, are they certified to TEACH? Cuz it doesn\u2019t sound like it. Doesn\u2019t matter what country you are from\u2014certification is applicable on an international level.\n\nIf you have that kind of fear, your decision-making is impaired.

Cuz if it was the famous blue hole I\u2019m thinking of\u2026it\u2019s considered the most deadly dive location in the world for a reason.

I am exactly the same. I love to swim but only if my feet touch. Parents do try to get their kids to do new things. Though at the point you were in tears, they should have backed down.", "You\u2019re NTA abut your parents surely are! You don\u2019t list you age but I\u2019m young. I get they wanted you to try something new and exciting like this but to force you to do and then humiliate you when you were scared to is just absolutely disgusting!! I have the same fear that you do. I love the ocean, would love to try scuba diving but I know I\u2019d be too scared to. The fact of humiliating you and punishing you by not speaking to you the rest of the day like their children is absolutely ridiculous and shitty ass parenting.", "Shees, NTA. I was in Egypt for my honeymoon with my husband. Part of ship trip was snorkeling. He didn't want to go and guess what? I didn't force him to because I'm not a self-centered psycho who pushes people to do what aren't comfortable to do and labels it as bonding time...You made very clear You didn't want to do this multiple times, your family sucks.", "NTA. Don't you usually have to train to SCUBA dive? It shouldn't have been a problem that you didn't want to do it. They could have done it without you and did do it without you. You said as soon as it was mentioned that you didn't want to do it and that should have been the end of it.", "God, I really feel for you. Your family sounds awful. You are definitely NTA.\n\n1) you explained your fears, set boundaries, and even compromised by saying you'd go with them but stay on the boat\n\n2) they bullied you into going past your comfort zone, and you even agreed to try\n\n3) when you decided you'd have enough, your mom continued to bully you when you were in clear distress\n\n4) your family made fun of you for your panic attack.\n\nThese people are not compassionate or supportive. It seems to me that you bent over backwards to be accommodating but they can't offer you a modicum of respect or care. SCUBA diving is not without risks and even experienced divers understand that there is a huge psychological element to safety. The dive instructor really should have stood up for you here. I'm so sorry nobody went to bat for you. You can get hugs at r/momforaminute if you need to process this with kinder family members.", "Very rich of them, first making you do something you excited explained you didn't want to do, then making fun of you and on top accusing you of ruining their day. Scuba diving is great,  many things are great, but not everyone wants to do them, and shouldn't have to. I am sorry your folks behaved like this.", "NTA. I love scuba but also feel it is dangerous. I wouldn\u2019t do it if I felt uncomfortable. I skipped a non refundable dive because I came down with a bad cold and couldn\u2019t breathe well and worried I would have an issue. If I was terrified every time I dove I assume I would create life threatening issues pretty regularly. \nYou set a clear boundary and the family didn\u2019t respect it. That sucks but isn\u2019t your fault", "I din't understand why the dive master even allowed you to get in the water because of your reaction let alone get in the water w/ the equipment. Why didn't they stop your mother?", "NTA. Being terrified of the open sea is very different to being terrified of rollercoasters, for instance. Being afraid won\u2019t kill you on a rollercoaster, but it absolutely can if you are scuba diving.", "NTA!\n\nHowever, I'm calling this a fresh load off manure! You don't just put on the gear (BC, tank, regulator, weights, skinsuit/wetsuit, no suit, mask, fins etc) and jump in the water without going through a bare minimum of training. That training determines if you can safely dive or not.", "NTA.  I hope you learned a lesson from this.  NEVER allow anyone (especially family and friends) to make you do something you don't want to do.  Don't negotiate or change your position.  If the maximum you are willing to do is stay on the bought, then that's what you do.  Don't \"try it\" if you already said no.", "INFO- How old are you? Why did you change your mind and agree to try it when you knew you had a phobia?", "NTA. And as the parent of a child with serious anxiety, I don't understand your parents' reasoning here. I CANNOT imagine scheduling family bonding time on vacation with an activity that one family member is terrified of.\n\n(Please, OP, try to get some counseling for this fear of open water. It might have to wait  until you're on your own, I understand, but do try. I mean, sure, you can probably live your whole life avoiding open water, but why would you? Therapy really can help.)", "With OP's level of fear, if she had continued to try, I can't help but think there would have been a 100% chance of catastrophe.\n\n*fwiw tho i'm terrified of the ocean. i'm an excellent swimmer but as i age i'm more and more afraid of large bodies of water.", "This is what I was thinking. I love scuba diving, and scuba diving in Egypt is supposed to be top tier. However, despite being a popular vacation sport, scuba diving is not without its risks. In fact, it's basically all about managing risks. Which means being calm. Which means not being afraid, and it it especially means not being forced to do it.   \n\n\nThey should have let OP stay on the boat. I'm assuming this was a resort certification type dive and not advanced open water, I bet they'd only be down for 30 minutes tops. OP is definitely NTA.", "Yeah! Imagine what a nice example could have been set if OP's boundaries were respected. It doesn't sound like these parents are emotionally available--their child isn't allowed to express or experience feelings that they don't share or approve of.", "Not only NTA, but also good of you being brave enough to try something despite being scared. I'm sure most of it was pressure, but still, despite all your fears you tried. Double shame on your family, since you were the only grown person in the group.", "That was my question as well. I find it hard to believe that people who have never even put on the equipment before were being thrown into the ocean.", "Egypt is a great diving location, and for a recreational dive (6-12 metres) you don't need to be certified - You just need to be with a certified Diver. \n\nOpen sea is usually a mile or two away from the shore, rather than being 10 miles out or something. \n\nI've done it a couple of times, and even know a couple of non-swimmers who can do recreational dives.", "I was thinking this.\n\nI don't know how deep they are going, but if someone were to panic when they are in deep and try to swim out too quickly it puts them at risk of \"the bends\"\n\nBasically, trying to surface too quickly can cause pockets of air to form in the blood vessels as the pressure decreases. This is not only incredibly painful, but deadly.\n\nNot to mention the plethora of other issues that can occur when someone panics. Scuba diving requires being calm.", "15, I guess I thought I might agree at the last minute since my parents wouldn't get their money back if they canceled for me so I didn't wanna waste their money", "Not the ocean, the Red Sea!", "Oh interesting. The few places that I\u2019ve been and considered diving I think we needed to be certified or do their certification classes in the pool before ever going into open water. But yeah I do have a pretty limited exposure to it so I guess it is just different in other places. Ill get around to getting certified eventually lol", "That would be entirely, and totally, on them. You were quite clear that you *didn't* want to dive and why, but they went ahead and ignored you. Then, your reward for trying, because they decided they knew best, was to be mocked for being afraid, and to be told that you'd ruined things. You didn't. They did. By not listening to you.\n\nIt really, really, isn't okay that they blamed you, let your siblings mock you, and joined in with making fun of you for being scared. Not only are we all scared of something, and that should be met with empathy, but it isn't right to treat somebody the way you were treated. It's pretty fucked up, honestly. \n\nNTA.", "Awww, kid. I\u2019m sorry you went through this. I get they couldn\u2019t leave you by yourself, but I thought the plan to stay on the boat was a fair one. You didn\u2019t owe them anything. Their money is theirs to waste.\n\nHonestly the next time they bring up this event, tell them it\u2019s something you will be discussing with your therapist when you\u2019re older and walk away. \n\nYou\u2019re not an embarrassment. You ruined nothing. You\u2019re a good kid. NTA.", "Another Scuba Diver on his way to getting certified as an instructor, there is a whole lot of major red flags here.\n\nWhile you can dive without certification under the supervision of a certified instructor, the mere fact that, as indicated by the way you wrote your post, the first time you even put on equipment was as you were about to dive is very troubling. A little bit of orientation, some practice on decending, maintaining neutral buoyancy, clearing masks, controlled accents, etc... should all have been done, preferably in a pool before you go open water.\n\nYou are so clearly NTA. The dive shop/divemaster etc... on the other hand are approaching being dangerously negligent, and I would really question their level of ability, certification, and equipment.\n\nAnd regardless of how amazing diving is, if you are ever feeling uncomfortable about a dive YOU DO NOT GO IN, regardless of your abilities, the abilities of those with you, or their desire to go. If you are uncomfortable you are a danger to yourself and others. Full stop!", "NTA.  You have a real fear & the fact that they kept you in the water while you were clearly having a panic attack is abuse.  Trying to make you feel like you ruined their time after doing that to you?  What kind of parents do that?", "NTA\n\nTHEY ruined their own experience with their lack of respect, lack of understanding, and lack of compassion for you. Wow. All they had to do was let you do what you were comfortable with, and everything would have been fine for everyone. You didn't ask for anything special or inconvenient. \n\nInstead, they insisted, and ended up making everyone miserable. Your mother wouldn't let you get out? Guilt tripped you? Your family made fun of you? Now they won't speak to you? What a bunch of AHs!\n\nAll people have to do is be nice to one another. Why does that seem so hard?", "NTA", "I love swimming. Love the ocean. Would love to learn SCUBA. That being said, NTA at all, by any meaning of the word!\n\nYou could have *literally* died out there, with them trying to force it on you, especiallywith you panicking! Experienced divers can easily die out there. Your family, and that instructor are *horrible* people!", "What the hell kind of dive instructor/boat captain would allow this? A panicked diver is a recipe for disaster. I would figure out the dive company's info and report them. They could have gotten you killed, and I'm not even kidding you. Also your family sucks. Family bonding? Underwater? Where you can't communicate lol. NTA.", "Don't know about who ITA, but this part got me:\n\n>the heavy oxygen bottle\n\nYou really need to pay attention when an instructor is giving you life or death information. Just a good Life Tip.\n\n(No, it was not an oxygen bottle.)", "NTA. Your parents/siblings are huge AHs and that instructor should lose their certification. I'm PADI certified and had to go through an entire process to be able to dive in deep ocean, let alone get certified. They don't just throw you overboard and tell you to sink or sink, lol. And they definitely don't force you to stay in the water if you're panicking. You were in an extremely dangerous situation that could have had a tragic ending. \n\nScuba diving isn't for everyone and that's OK, I started the process of getting certified when I was a teen, along with my dad. We went through the classroom part with no problem, but when we started practice dives he couldn't push through his fear/anxiety of breathing through the scuba equipment underwater. And this was a 40-something year old man who had lived on an island and been in and out of deep ocean water his entire life! I know it's easier said then done, but don't let your family push past your boundaries in the name of \"bonding.\"", "I\u2019m not sure why they care if you just chilled on the boat? It\u2019s a weird hill to die on. As a diver, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t if you weren\u2019t comfortable! It wouldn\u2019t have been safe. Hope you had a fun trip otherwise. NTA!", "I'm scuba diving certified and I'm still trying to figure out how they even let you put all the gear on and dive for the first time in open water without doing pool training first. So much can go wrong with diving and it can be dangerous if you don't understand what you're doing before you end up in open water. Most definitely NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m a scuba diver (peep my username) and your family is awful.", "NTA.  That was abusive of your mom and family to force you to stay in the water after you were already having a panic attack. The instructor should have put their foot down as well, but I suppose money was more important than your comfort and safety.  You should be happy they are leaving you alone for the rest of the day because they deserve the silent treatment more than you do.  If you are old enough to leave and do your own thing (and have the finances) go do that.", "Your parents and siblings give of big TA energy...\n\nyou're NTA... you're scared... that's a valid feeling... other people can respect that... and you even warned your parents multiple times before... yet they still tried to pressure you into something you're scared of... you're soooooo not the AH", "NTA your family and that diving guide suck! It\u2019s not safe to try to force a panicking, scared person to go underwater like that - how are you going to remember any of the process and safety measures if you are that freaked out? I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t a reputable company to begin with and your family? Ugh, can\u2019t even.", "Anybody experienced will tell you it\u2019s not a great (terrible, really) idea to attempt SCUBA diving without proper training. Tossing people with little to no knowledge of the science and the many dangers of diving into the water with gear is insane to me. NTA. At all.", "NTA.  They ruined the family bonding time by not honouring anything you said.  \n\nPlus, that's dangerous and irresponsible of them.  If you had been killed, it would have ruined things for a lot more people.  \n\nI don't know how old you are or how independently you are able to live, but you should really start working towards independence, because I don't think your parents and siblings will get better.", "As a scuba diver I second all of this. \n\nI grew up around the ocean and have never experienced any phobias about anything water related. That said I really, really want OP to know that how they were treated and how their family treated them was absolutely horrible! \n\nMy first several scuba experiences were in a shallow pool, and my certification dives were in a small quarry. I would have been terrified if my first experience was in the ocean - that would be pretty overwhelming! And as a stranger, if I was on this excursion I would have been deeply uncomfortable with the instructor allowing this to happen and I honestly would have offered to stay on the boat with OP. Just awful. I know it\u2019s fairly common to be thrown in the deep end, so to speak, at resorts offering intro to scuba courses but I don\u2019t think it sets you up for success considering scuba is all about remaining calm so you can manage and mitigate risk.", "So OP was in another country but generally you get certified before you dive in the ocean.  You learn in a pool in a safe environment.  There is a LOT to learn about proper use the equipment. Diving for the first time in the open ocean is frankly insane.\n\nMy spouse is an experienced diver with cave and rescue experience.", "Someone else replied with this about diving in Egypt.\n\n>>>> Egypt is a great diving location, and for a recreational dive (6-12 metres) you don't need to be certified - You just need to be with a certified Diver.\n\n>>>> Open sea is usually a mile or two away from the shore, rather than being 10 miles out or something.\n\nAnyways NTA OP don\u2019t know much about diving but what your describing about feeling I could only guess would lead to a massive disaster if you\u2019d gone and scuba dived.", "Yeah this for real. Making someone confront a fear like this without a professional mental health expert is straight up abuse. I dunno your age, OP, but Ive known people who have PTSD for their entire life from enduring less during childhood or teenage years from an incident like this.", "I highly doubt that people on these family recreational dives are going deep enough or staying down long enough to worry about the bends.", "As previously mentioned, a lot of places allow you to do discovery dives with minimal previous prep.", "That\u2019s a very fair point! Based on that detail, which I totally missed, they\u2019re open sea which argues against the blue hole. But, assuming this person is not a trained diver, they may not understand what \u201copen sea\u201d means. In which case, more details from OP about family experience would be helpful.", "Just a little more info, discovery dives are supposed to be with a certified INSTRUCTOR, not just someone with their C-Card (Open Water certification) \n\nMost resorts have access to a dive shop where you can arrange for a discovery dive that includes a bit of training in the equipment. And if you like that, go find yourself a good dive program, the course can be done over 2 weekends. Totally worth it.", "Honestly sounds like a good way to die.  Learning to use the regulator takes practice.", "NTA. Your family is terrible.", "NTA. I am a scuba diver, though haven't had the opportunity to dive in several years. In no way would it be okay to expect you to dive if you're fearful of it.  You'll be a risk to yourself and everyone else around you. This is not something to just try to get over, someone can end up very ill or dead if it goes wrong, possibly more than one person if it becomes an on the fly rescue situation. It's okay to know your limits and stick to them.", "NTA but your family are. I really don't get people who try to force others to do things they don't wanna do. So disrespectful.", "NTA. Scuba diving is an activity where confidence and calmness is vital for safety. Your parents wanted to share something that they enjoy with you but they have no right to pressure you into something that made you genuinely fear for your own personal safety. You told your parents your boundaries and even gave it a shot for them, they should be thankful and proud of you for that. I find it really worrying that they didn\u2019t support you afterwards, loving someone means never wanting to see them scared or distressed. The dive instructor should have never tried to make you stay in either, that\u2019s completely irresponsible and abusive of their position. Don\u2019t worry about anyone else having seen your reaction, even a responsible dive team (which yours wasn\u2019t) will have seen it all before, they should have stepped in on your behalf when they realised the pressure. As an aside from the awful situation you were put through, I think of scuba diving as a fairly antisocial sport. Yes, you\u2019re in pairs and in a group but it\u2019s a very internal experience and I think the most social bit takes place back on the boat. Your parents might be disappointed but you and your well-being should be their priority over everything and I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re being treated like this.", "NTA. I'm a bit irritated by your story, I also learned scuba diving in Egypt (with my son who was 10 back then) , and this included several steps: a long video, trying on the stuff in a pool, diving in the pool, proofing in the pool that the stuff was learned from the video (we had to remove our diving goggles, put them back on and get the water out, had to stay calm and react when our air stopped (signing to the partner and using his air), show and understand all the signs... Just jumping into the water like this sounds dangerous. In our course there where two other kids, and my son was the only kid  that passed the course, and was allowed to go with the instructor (and me) into the open sea, where there where more lessons, and then we got our scuba diving licenses.\nYour situation actually sounds unsafe.", "There are places that let you scuba without certification?", "NTA\n\nBeing very afraid to the point of panic under the water sounds like a great way to decide that you need to hold your breath and swim straight up to the surface.  Hello serious lung damage!\n\nYou tried to establish a boundary about it, but they were unacceptably pushy until you capitulated and then couldn't go through with it once you hit the water.\n\nSince it was your first time, I assume this was the certification, where you would be required to take your mask off underwater, put it back on, then get the water out by blowing through your nose.  Again, not a great recipe for calmness.\n\nNothing wrong with snorkeling at Ras Mohammed instead.", "NTA, but hopefully you learned a huge lesson, do not let yourself be bullied and pressured to do things you are not comfortable with.  If you wanted to dive, then by all means work on your fear, but don't do it for others.", "I\u2019m questioning parents and the scuba company for letting a young adult go into the open seas for the first time scuba diving. Aren\u2019t you supposed to learn in a pool or a better controlled environment?your parents suck I\u2019m sorry", "NTA\n\nAnd at some point in the future when one of the family members who taunted you about your fear has some concern, I would be ever so petty and say in that situation. \"Remember how your treated me when I was terrified? Give me one good reason to show you any empathy.\"\n\nI did do that to a boyfriend. I had been voicing concerns. He blew me off. When he brought up a concern, I responded with \"I will show you as much concern/interested as you showed me.\" and proceeded to ignore him. He actually got the point.", "I've been scuba diving for many years and absolutely love it now.  It wasn't love at first sight though and I was scared to death my first open water dive.  It sounds like the parents aren't qualified to be diving if they thought this was okay.  The \"instructor\" doesn't sound qualified either.  Diving can be safe and enjoyable but everyone needs the proper training first.    \n\nMaybe I'm missing something, but don't most reputable diving companies require your certification?", "NTA you could have died and it would have been their fault", "NTA\n\nyour parents ruined their own experience by not respecting your boundaries and compromises.", "ESH\n\nYour family for guilting you into scuba diving AND then for mocking you, making fun of you, and blaming you for a ruin dive and embarrassment.\n\nYou for not standing up for yourself AND for not alerting the dive instructor.\n\nThe dive instructor for not paying attention to a person about to panic.\n\nI took scuba diving to prove that - in spite of my fear of dark water, depth, open water, my irrational fear of drowning - this was something I could learn to do. I explained everything to the dive instructor and he kept extra track of me.  When we went on the open water, he held my hand until we were at the bottom. We had hand signs that meant 'are you ok' and 'yes, I'm fine' / 'OMG, I'm this close to panicking'. I did fine. Do I enjoy diving? No. Can I dive... yeah, I know how and I know that I can if I need to. Does it terrify me? Yep, still but I know that I can dive even terrified... I just use a hellofalotmore air (and it's usually air, not oxygen).", "this is so so so true!! i am also a diver and my dad was an instructor for 30+ years with hundreds of logged dives (and a fair amount of real time rescues) and this exact situation is what can kill. the worst things you can do while scuba diving are panic, hold your breath, and rocket to the surface\u2014which typically happen all at once. any diver on this thread knows that you shouldn\u2019t rocket up to the surface and that is exactly what would happen. even if it seems \u201cjust\u201d 5-15 ft under that is the most dangerous place to move fast towards the surface!!\n\nno one should be forcing you into situations that make you panic. especially when those situations are in what is considered an \u201cextreme sport.\u201d and triple especially when panicking is literally the worst thing you could do that would put you and others around you in the most danger and could cause death!! they shouldn\u2019t have signed you up in the first place let alone made you try it. NTA x10", "I\u2019m fascinated with the ocean depths and can understand why that would be peaceful. However\u2026. I\u2019m too scared to try scuba diving. I\u2019m not a strong swimmer, and drowning seems like such a terrifying way to die\u2026 \n\nI would LOVE to take a submarine tour though! \ud83d\ude06", "I don\u2019t understand why they started in open water with inexperienced divers, I had several lessons in a pool before we went into the ocean.", "I agree. And especially with this level of discomfort it sounds like there was no proper training, no pool dives or learning how to deal with emergencies is even more dangerous. \n\nThe parents ruined their own dive by bullying their kid into trying something that terrified them. It took serious nerves to even agree just to spend the day on the boat and the family should have been happy with that.", "To amplify, I am someone with similar fears. People often cannot empathize and it sucks. They just do not get it.\n\nEdit people not the person above", "I always recommend people do their pool/class time at home and then do their test dives on vacation. You get the boring stuff out of the way first, and then you get to do your tests in beautiful warm waters.", "I actually got my certification while on vacation in another country. I'm glad I did since the dive sites were much better than anything available near where I lived at the time. You just have to be smart about it.", "Actually a great way to learn to dive is to do it on vacation. Depending on where you live it can be cold and icky. So you can start with the land and pool training and home and do the certification dives on vacation!", "Not to mention when diving in a family group panic can get people left behind. I had this happen- there two parents and three kids in my dive group. And one kid was panicking and other got upset. Both parents and the DM surfaced with them. \n\nLeft me on the bottom with kid #3. She was ok cause I\u2019m moderately responsible and looked out for her on the swim back. (Though if I\u2019d been more responsible I probably would have cut my dive short and surfaced)", "So many sketchy dive shops all over will take people out for \u201cintro dives\u201d with barely any training. In the Caribbean \u201cresort courses\u201d give you about an hour in the pool first", "And when the OP freaking surfaced and said I want to get out they tried to force him to go down anyway!?!?!?", "My family is planning activities for our cruise were doing in a few months. My husband loves boats, hates the water. Won't even snorkel with me. I would never dream of forcing him into a situation where he felt unsafe just because the rest of us wanted to. \n\n\nLuckily, we're a huge party of 6 adults, 2 kids, plus my sister's friends with w more adults and 2 kids. So we'll be do a lot of split activities that people can choice between.", "Yeah I'm confused. If there's any sort of dive instructor or whatever there, how in the fuck were they not immediately getting OP back on the boat with all that panic.", "If nothing else, she'd be blowing through her air supply much faster than everyone else.", "Also the fastest way scuba diving becomes dangerous is when people pa.", "I agree with don\u2019t try anything you are scared off. And most reputable places make you prove some swimming ability to learn to dive-\n\nBut the air tank is strapped to a vest that can inflate so when you are on the surface you just bob along. So if a worry is that the tank will drag you down, there is something to consider.", "If you are interested at all, I would definitely recommend a \"try scuba\" event at your local scuba shop if they have an indoor pool. They go over the basics, they're in the water with you, and you basically just swim around in the pool and practice your buoyancy. Putting your head underwater and breathing for the first time is a really magical experience.\n\nWhen talking to non-divers, most reference not being great swimmers and/or a worry that they would feel claustrophobic.  However, as another commenter pointed out, you don't actually have to be a super, super strong swimmer to be a diver. You have to get to know how and why your gear works and how to maintain buoyancy. How to kick correctly. Etc.\n\nI find that having this knowledge actually gives me a greater sense of security when I'm diving. There's a nice feeling of independence and self-reliance. I've read and trained and I have backups and know the correct procedures, etc.\n\nAnd rather than being claustrophobic, it feels very free. You're practically weightless, and it's really one of the only times I feel truly peaceful. Being down in the cool water, rising and falling just slightly with every breath, hearing nothing but my own even breathing and the tickling of bubbles.", "Agreed.  I had several hours of class time before I even went near a pool.  I wouldn't want to waste my vacation doing the class portion.", "For shallow dive sites, lung over expansion injury is probably a bigger concern than decompression sickness (\u201cthe bends\u201d). But yeah there are definitely ways an untrained diver could injure themselves even at a reasonably shallow dive site.", "That is good to know. I thought you had to be certified to go scuba diving. But maybe that\u2019s just to go alone and not with a professional\u2026.", "Someone hasn\u2019t taken their scuba certification yet ;) it totally is possible in even in fairly shallow water.", "Decent places will only take you if you are certified. Some will do proper \u201cintro to diving\u201d courses with proper introductory lessons and pool time. \n\nOthers just want your money and are good to go."]}
