Meanwhile dad gets to give the impression that he pays a lot for their necessities AND pays for fun things. In reality he doesn\u2019t pay child support (the minimum he should be doing) and plays \u201cdad\u201d to do fun things. OR OP can show the kids the real finances, expose their dad as a deceiving, lying, deadbeat and all that implies, and potentially make herself look like a bad guy by shattering that illusions.\n\nIn both instances it\u2019s all ex\u2019s fault.", "That's a fantastic Outlook", "It depends on the situation of course\n\nKids: dad says he pays for the house\n\nMom: what do you think\n\nKids: mom I dont fucking know it's not like I have access to the finances let alone how to parse them even if I did", "and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14gbm9u/comment/jp56503/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) will be the end result. it's not placing hatred to have kids be wary that one parent is lying to them.", "Maths enthusiast and teacher here. I totally bristled at your dig at trigonometry (so amazing imo!) because I think Maths (or parts of it) are constantly used in film and social media as the most scary subject on the planet. It seems to be the go to for useless thing pushed on children and I do not agree.\n\nHowever, I had to re-evaluate what you said. Finance is part of Maths (not the part I'm good at) and you are right, it would be more useful for more people.", "best response so far.  the whole 'think of the children!!!' argument is dead in the water.  they did, they showed them the truth.", "Engineering major here, budgeting and finances has wider use than trig.", "Finances are applicable to pretty much everyone. Trig is mostly applicable to engineers", "I always wondered though if the producers hadn't left the door open to have her back because I felt that Pulaski was really not all that endearing (perhaps intentionally so)."]}
