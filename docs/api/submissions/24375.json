Your friend has taken enough time and effort to indulge, delude himself that he's an underdog that managed to win the rat race through nothing but grit and guts. While that a character flaw in it's own right, especially when one likes to paint themselves as a \"poor college kid\", it doesn't mean you are in your right or correct to have an outburst like that and call him out in front of your shared social circle.\n\nIf you, keyword, want to keep being part of this friend group, odds are you'll have to bite the bullet, and *at the very least* make a show of apologizing and then, maybe slowly, cut him out of your life.", "YTA. He really hasn't done much. He's privileged but your examples are more about your jealousy.\n\nHe thought he bought a house, well he did, his parents gave him money and he bought it. You have an issue with the fact that he didn't work for the money but that's your issue not his. \n\nHe doesn't know why your work doesn't just pay for your vacation, okay that's his ignorance, but you didn't get angry at his ignorance, you got pissed that you can't afford a vacation that he can.\n\nIt's okay to be jealous of people who got the nat 20 roll in life and live on easy mode. Sure saying HE bought a house makes him sound more personally successful than he is, but you'd also call him a snobbish prick if he was lording how rich his parents were. Basically there is no winning because it's not about what he said, it's about him having money and your jealousy. Do you want to lose all your friends including your oldest friend because you can't handle your jealousy or do you think you should work on that and keep all your friends?\n\nWhat happens if someone else in that group gets a ridiculous job with a salary 5x yours and buys the same kind of house but based off their own success, you going to hate that guy too because he has what you want and you don't?", "YTA because you snapped at him in front of your mutual friends. Should\u2019ve told him in private that he\u2019s becoming insufferable. But yeah, it sounds like he\u2019s not fun to be around.", "Nta- although you have been friends for a while it\u2019s clear that over time he\u2019s changed, if you had found the change fine it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to stay friends, but if you don\u2019t like the change it\u2019s okay if you decide that you were friends with the \u201cold\u201d him but that you can\u2019t see yourself being friends with the \u201cnew\u201d him. This had happened with two of my friends and they agreed that they worked better as friends before they changed, but in the end it\u2019s still your choice and you need to listen to what your heart thinks will be best.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoney is NOT dividing people. AHs like you are dividing people with their jealousy.", "NTA. He\u2019s sitting there lying to his friends. Liars are lame. You just brought facts to the table. He should humble himself and learn the lesson. Your friends likely siding with him cause he\u2019s got free money and therefor perks to give", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They earned it themselves and I'd be happy for them. I have other friends who are in similar financial situations as Bob but recognise that their privilege has afforded them their lifestyle which is completely fine and poses no issues in the friendship.\n\nJust want to be clear, it's not jealousy that frustrates me, it's the self absorption, ignorance, lack of empathy to anyone's financial situation aside from their own.

TBH I'm not seeing why any of you want to keep hanging out with nepo-dude...he sounds like he has disappeared up his own  rear end......", "If he thinks your work would ever on this planet pay for your vacation, he must not think it ridiculous for *him* to pay for your vacation.

Just can't stand him as a person now which is a shame as we've all been friends a very long time", "Wish I could but he would have to ask his parents for the money first haha"]}
