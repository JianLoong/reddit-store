It was a mid size party, maybe 20-25 people there.\n\nI was walking to the other side of the room and walking by Amy's brother Liam and his friend. The friend pushed Liam's shoulder (too hard but it was playfully, they were not fighting). Liam was rather drunk at this point - he lost his balance and stumbled back into me. Liam is quite a bit larger than I am so when he stepped back into me, the motion pushed me into the wall and knocked several vintage glass dishes off a shelf and onto the ground. They belonged to Amy and Liam's grandma and were valuable, both sentimentally and monetarily.\n\nAmy started crying and I told her how sorry I was that this had happened. Amy told me it would be hundreds of dollars to try to find replacements and I should venmo her \"$500 to start and she'd let me know the balance after she located the same/similar pieces\". I refused and told her that she needed to take it up with her brother - it was not my fault that someone else didn't have control of their own motions.\n\nI was sober and would not have fallen had it not been for a large drunk man bumping into me and I feel it's extremely unfair to blame me for others actions when I was simply in the wrong spot at the wrong time and had no way to predict his movements. If my body had not been there, Liam would've fallen into the wall with his own body and would have to accept the responsibility so the fact that I was passing by there shouldn't be the main consideration. They have said that's \"irrelevant\" because I *was* there. Several people who saw this happen fully back me on this because there's nothing I could've done to prevent it but others are taking the \"it doesn't matter that you didn't do it on purpose, it's still your fault\" stance. I received many calls from Amy demanding I pay but I won't. I would've consider at least contributing if I hadn't been blamed like that but Liam and his friend refusing all accountability for this has put such a bad taste in my mouth that I wouldn't feel okay offering at this point.", "created_utc": 1677796789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ghsvf/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_expensive_glass/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No of course not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPossibly the clearest NTA I've seen here in a while.", "NTA, but I disagree with everyone saying it's Liam's fault for losing his balance. The guy who shoved him is the one who started this.\n\nOP, all you need to do is wear an arm sling or a neck brace and ask Amy about her homeowner's insurance and I guarantee she'll stop nagging you about the glassware. She should be grateful you weren't injured.", "NTA.  Liam and his friend are the ones who should be responsible.  Homeowners insurance might cover it.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay. If they were that important to her, she should have put them away before having a party.", "NTA.  Amy and her bro sound like they come from a family that doesn\u2019t teach their kids to be responsible for their own actions.  Literally both of them have significantly more responsibility for this than you.", "NTA. \n\nOP, did she ask you to pay up right there in front of everyone??? \n\nIf so, how awkward\u2026 Weird thing for a friend to do, especially in front of and with a group of friends. \n\nIf not, it\u2019s still awkward, and I wouldn\u2019t give her any money.", "NTA\n\n$500 to start with, uh nope! \n\nIf they were so valuable, she should have locked them away.\n\nShe should take it up with her renters or homeowners insurance.\n\nShe could ask drunk brother and friend to chip in and pay.\n\nFriendship may be gone. \n\nOther friends if they give you a hard time, they need to mind their own business. Tell them you had to get X-rays and are going for weekly massages and accupucture for your back and are looking for a therapist to deal with the shaming and verbal attacks from the party. You are going to need her to pay for those costs!", "NTA - you were sober and her drunk bumbling brother knocked you over. Amy is only directing this at you because she knows there is no chance in hell she will get her brother to pay up or take responsibility so she is attacking the next most likely person she can coerce into paying for her brother's error. Don't cave. This will be an expensive lesson for her about putting away vintage breakables when you allow drunk people into your house.", "NTA. Do they have homeowners or renters insurance? Plus get new friends. They all sound like dicks.", "NTA\n\nIt absolutely makes a difference whether you inattentively crashed into the plates or were pushed.", "NTA technically I hit a car and totaled my car but considering a lady pulled out of a parking lot directly into my lane IT WASNT MY FAULT. Cops ticked her and insurance found her at fault.", "NTA. This sounds like Liam\u2019s issue, and his co-wrestler\u2019s.", "NTA. If it happened exactly as you said.  Liam is the one who should pay to replace them.", "NTA Liam is at fault so should pay", "NTA. Why the fuck would she have such expensive fancy breakables out during a party where there's drunk people? Who thinks that's a good idea", "NTA\n\nNot your fault.  I think you need to accept the loss of the friendship and move on.", "NTA. This is on Liam, not you, and if Amy doesn't accept that, you should probably drop her as a friend.\n\nYou should not have said you were sorry at the party, either, frankly, though it speaks well of you that you reacted with sympathy towards Amy rather than anger towards Liam.", "Nta. It\u2019s the drunk brother and his friend that should pay. You\u2019re just minding your business. Let her know you need her homeowners insurance information since you got hit and you may need to seek medical attention and see how fast she changes her tune", "NTA. Precious, rare, or sentimental items should be relocated somewhere safe if you're inviting 25 people over for a party where people are getting drunk.", "NTA. You don't owe her anything for an accident you didn't even start. I get paying for accidents if its 100% your fault, like dropping someones phone, but how could you have conquered being pushed by a bigger person?", "NTA, you got knocked into. Honestly it should fall on whoever pushed Liam, I would say it's them more than Liam even if Liam was drunk, someone did push him. But definitely not on you.", "NTA - Not your fault that:  \n  \n1. Liam pushed you into the wall, not your fault  \n2. she didn't have enough smarts to put the expensive stuff away before having a party where there would be DRUNK people, not your fault", "You START with a down-payment of 500 and she will see what it amounts to.\n\nAnd these valuable glasses were just laying about in a house full of drunk people? \n\nSmells like a scam.\n\nNtA", "NTA, her brother needs to venmo the money. You were just trying to walk by when a drunk person bumps into you. You weren't at fault here.", "NTA, that is clear as detailed by many others. Would recommend you take a moment and write down exactly what happened as you remember it, then ask the witnesses you cite to do the same. It likely will never come to it given the circumstances, but if they decide to pursue legal action at a later time you will have the proof you would likely need to refute any claims.", "NTA. If it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the friend\u2019s for pushing an obviously drunk guy. Second would be Liam. You had literally no control over the situation nor should you be in charge of reimbursing their tomfoolery.", "NTA. Not remotely your fault, and you shouldn\u2019t pay her. Liam and his friend were horsing around, and you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. If she didn\u2019t have the sense to put away her fragile family heirlooms before having a bunch of drunk people at her house, that\u2019s her problem, not yours.", "NTA - that should have been put away. If its anyones faults, its Liam's, but personally I think the house owner is at fault here considering none of it was malicious.", "Nta You weren't the one being foolish, Liam was. \n\nWay I see it people who respect others wouldn't carry on like that in a house. By the sounds of things you sound early 20s with no idea of selfcontrol(most of you)", "Nta they should put stuff like that away if there's people and drinking.", "NTA\n\nIf they were that valuable and sentimental she could have removed them before the party.  I would tell her to take out an insurance claim if she wants her money back.  Accidents happen!", "NTA. this is on her brother. if she wants to call the cops or threaten court, let her. \n\n[also, i wouldn't be surprised if your friend and the brother had planned this. she seemed pretty quick to come to a dollar amount.]", "NTA\n\nLiam fell into you, therefore he is the one at fault. Just because your body is the one that connected to the cabinet doesn't make you at fault.\n\n>I was sober and would not have fallen had it not been for a large drunk man bumping into me\n\nThis is correct.\n\nI'd get everyone's name & number that was witness and tell her to sue you.", "I guarantee you that they don't cost hundreds of dollars. I have alot of experience pricing antiques- the prices on glassware are really depressed. That said of course,  NTA. You are the victim of a drunk and his money grubbing sister.", "NTA.
