If she has a problem with it, and really really pushes the issue, you can threaten court because you have a text that she's responded to trying to  justify her actions and not arguing about them at all. Hopefully she won't, and you putting your foot down and refusing to pay more or not use the room, AS AGREED, is doable. On a side note? The fact that the dryer takes forever to dry may VERY WELL mean a badly clogged dryer vent. That's a huge fire hazard. Watch a youtube video of dryer vent cleaning and you'll see what I mean!

What is she? Since its her place, with mortgage and all, she would be your landlord, with you being a tenant she's renting a room to. These kinds of matters really should have written agreements documented on. With everything being just word of mouth, and nothing written down, this all turns into a matter of he said she said and anything can be done.\n\nNow, with the laundry issue. Since we have no proper agreement in place, you have two options. You can either deal with the washer/dryer issue, or go to a public laundromat.\n\nFor the rent. The big question is \"Is the rent actually going up? Or is utility usage going up so she's expecting more to cover your half of the utilities?\" Again, no written agreement, meaning she's in full charge to ask whatever she'd like from you. Your options are either pay up or find a place, especially since you don't have proper legal tenancy there.\n\nAs for your partner moving in as well, this can actually explain the reasoning of \"rent\" increasing. Again, we have no written agreement, so nothing is sure for you.\n\nAs for using the extra room to work, well, even if just by word of mouth, you're only renting the one big room in the basement. She can dictate how the other rooms in her house are allotted for use. With a written agreement, you've had two separate instances that would require a new agreement written up: your partner moving in with you, and wanting a second room for work purposes.\n\nSo, are you the AH? No. NTA. However, if you continue to expect her to make the accomodations for what you want, especially with nothing written down, you may end up being the AH. At this point, the three of you: you, your partner, and her, need to sit down and have a proper agreement drafted up. Your friend needs to make the proper notes on what she expects from you and your partner, who would be her tenants. You need to see if she's willing to accomadate certain aspects, like the extra room. If she doesn't, then go find an apartment or something, and let her figure out her mortgage on things.", "Yep, for something as important as where you live, you need a contract (sounds like OP is more of a lodger than a roommate)", "This sounds like a case of someone wanting rent money without the inconvenience of having a tenant.
