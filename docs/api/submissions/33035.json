Necessity of room- is the activity you\u2019re doing only capable of being done in that room. \n2. 1st come, 1st serve-were you the first one using the space?\n3. Practicality- kinda ties in with 1. But how practical is it to do activity in that room vs other room. Like you can read a book in the living room\u2026 or that bathroom. But unless youre taking a shit, that bathroom isn\u2019t a practical place to read. Also, if your home is one giant open space, it\u2019s not very practical to nap in that open space while living with someone else. \n\nSo, id say if you want to watch tv in the living room as thats the only place with a tv. You\u2019re in the right no matter what. However, if youre just watching videos on your phone, it doesn\u2019t matter where you watch that, so if he was in the living room napping first, youre an AH to enter the room to watch phone videos. You could very easily choose another location to start that. However, if you were in the living room first watching phone videos, he shouldn\u2019t try to start napping in that room either. \n\nAlso, just want to add that unplanned couch naps are awesome. Cuz yeah, if you\u2019re planning to nap, you should go to bed. But if you\u2019re on the couch already doing something else and you start to doze off, getting up to move to the bed kinda ruins the snoozy mood.", "You're an insufferable, passive agressive asshole.", "YTA I read a post just like this one a few months ago.
