NTA.", "NTA- if your mom doesn\u2019t routinely grope you inappropriately it was probably more likely misplaced affection. She wiped poop off that butt for years! So it may not occur to her that, now that you\u2019re older it\u2019s a little weird. When we were young, my dad used to threaten birthday spankings, one for every year old you were, as a joke bc our reaction was always NOOOOOO DAADDDDD NOOOOOOO! (Never negative energy) He brought up the joke again when I was 24 and I told him, \u201cDad I\u2019m 24 now so that a little weird\u2026\u201d and he\u2019s never brought it up again. \n\nNow the guy on the other hand\u2026what a huge red flag! He sounds like one of those \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy, I don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t sleep with me, b*tch!\u201d types. He needed to leave the party and probably leave your life while he\u2019s at it", "**NTA**\n\nAnd the people who are going off about your mom complimenting your body are missing something crucial:\n\nWhile it is VERY unhealthy to focus on girls' bodies in the sense of pushing a particular body type, and it would be problematic if your mum was focused on you being beautiful because you were skinny or conformed to a particular ideal . . . or if her being physically affectionate with you made you uncomfortable . . . she is doing literally NONE of that. What you seem to be saying (and please do correct me if I'm wrong) is that your mom has always boosted your confidence by telling you how beautiful you are and how perfect your physicality is EXACTLY AS YOU ARE, no matter what that is. \n\nIn other words, we literally have no idea what you look like. For all we know, you could be curvy, or plump, or not at all conforming to the social ideal. But your mum has always shown you physical affection in healthy ways that feel comforting and supportive TO YOU, and told you that she finds you extremely beautiful exactly as you are, no matter your shape. And that's the very definition of healthy. It's not \"focusing on your body\" so much as focusing on YOU, as a physical being. \n\nI think that the fact she delights in saying, \"I can't believe I made this\" (meaning this beautiful person, no matter your shape or size) is wonderful. And the only thing that matters about her touching you is that it doesn't make YOU squidgy. And you have said that it doesn't. NTA.\n\nThat guy had no right to \"save\" you from something when you didn't ask for his intervention, much less his opinion.", "NTA. Your mom sounds really nice.", "Not weird to me if you're comfortable with it. NTA", "NTA\n\nWho is this random stranger and why does he care?", "You were protecting your mom from what sounds like a nasty confrontation.  The fact that the guy got angry when you told him to leave your mom alone is alarming.  Your mom pinched your tush, she didn't grope you.  I've seen that before so I don't think your dynamic worth your mom is all that uncommon. This guy calling you the bad name was completely off.  He clearly has issues with women doing what they want with their bodies.  I wouldn't ever be around this guy again.  Don't invite him to anything. \n\nNTA", "Your mom's behavior is definitely going to come off as weird to most people.", "Who was the guy?", "NTA That guy was out of line. There's nothing wrong with your Mom. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Your mom punching your butt is pretty weird, but there's nothing wrong with it, either. The guy should have backed off immediately when you told him to.", "NTA - Your mom sounds funny, he needs to get a sense of humor and just mind his own business.", "Some families are way more open and sex/body positive than others. This doesn\u2019t sound weird or inappropriate to me, though I can see where some with a more modest upbringing would be bothered by it. Hopefully she compliments you on your other traits too, but to me this just reads as a woman trying to build up other women. Regardless, you told him it was fine and he did not listen. Then he took it to another level and got angry and inappropriate. NTA.", "NTA. It's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with your mother's behavior, but it's also important to recognize that different families have different dynamics and ways of showing affection. While it may be uncomfortable for some people, it sounds like your mother's behavior comes from a place of love and wanting to boost your confidence.\n\nIn this situation, the guy who confronted your mother and used a derogatory slur towards you is the ahole. It's not okay for him to use derogatory language towards you or to confront your mother about her behavior. It's important for people to communicate their boundaries and discomfort in a respectful manner, without resorting to name-calling or derogatory language.\n\nIt's important for you to have open and honest communication with your mother about how her behavior makes you feel, and to establish clear boundaries moving forward. While your mother's behavior may not be intended to harm you, it's important for her to understand your perspective and respect your boundaries. Ultimately, it's up to you to determine what behavior you're comfortable with and to communicate that to those around you.", "I would think your mom's behavior is off the chart weird.  However, your relationship with her is yours, not this guy's.  He has no right to be offended for you and you were well within your right to say so.  NTA.", "Wonder how many people would have different opinions if it were her father pinching her ass and complementing her body. \ud83e\udd14", "NTA because he was getting angry and it\u2019s your family\u2019s party. But holy moly!! I probably would\u2019ve reacted the same (besides getting angry). Your mom pinching your butt is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever heard be considered normal in a family.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a peach and you said it has never bothered you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that she pinched your butt, honestly. I think it\u2019s kind of like pinching a chubby baby leg to a mom - they still see us as their baby no matter how old we get. If you feel uncomfortable with it, or with it happening in front of people, you would be NTA if you asked her to hold back in front of company - but if you don\u2019t, let her be her and tell anyone with a problem to kick rocks. NTA at all.", "Well I am kind of stuck .The real question here is whether your mum is an A-hole or the guy who acted disgusted is. You just did what anyone who loved her family  will. Coming to the mum part,she is definitely  weird if not creepy. Behaviours like these are uncommon in normal households and the reaction of the guy seemed legit like what I would have reacted -minus the name calling etc. \n\nEdit: I guess the guy tried confronting her because he thought the OP was getting assaulted and wasn't brave enough to disclose it. I MEAN WHOSE PARENTS  WOULD BEHAVE LIKE THAT IN A SOCIAL GATHERING ,AMIRIGHT?\n\nTDLR: OP is NTA but the guy's reaction NTA too.", "Your mom *is* a weirdo, and so is the guy, for calling you a name. NTA.", "I think a lot of us would be better off if mum gave a loving bum pinch now and again \ud83d\udc95", "Your mom is definitely.... Bizarre. Honestly. \n\nMight be well-meaning and funny but....ick.", "NTA for asking him to leave, but your mom's behavior is a little weird and I don't understand why she is focusing so much on your looks. It's not really healthy to focus so much on women's appearances like that. But the dude was super out of line and I don't blame you for asking him to leave.", "Your mom is a weirdo. She should not be pinching your butt. That\u2019s not normal parent - child behavior. It is super creepy.", "Wait what? So your mom inappropriately pinched your ass and someone tried to defend you and you kicked him out of a party you were attending, not hosting, because everyone should think your mom's behavior is ok? If this was your dad pinching your ass would you say the same? You can be complimentary without being fucken weird.
