So it may not occur to her that, now that you\u2019re older it\u2019s a little weird. When we were young, my dad used to threaten birthday spankings, one for every year old you were, as a joke bc our reaction was always NOOOOOO DAADDDDD NOOOOOOO!

What you seem to be saying (and please do correct me if I'm wrong) is that your mom has always boosted your confidence by telling you how beautiful you are and how perfect your physicality is EXACTLY AS YOU ARE, no matter what that is. \n\nIn other words, we literally have no idea what you look like. For all we know, you could be curvy, or plump, or not at all conforming to the social ideal. But your mum has always shown you physical affection in healthy ways that feel comforting and supportive TO YOU, and told you that she finds you extremely beautiful exactly as you are, no matter your shape. And that's the very definition of healthy. It's not \"focusing on your body\" so much as focusing on YOU, as a physical being. \n\nI think that the fact she delights in saying, \"I can't believe I made this\" (meaning this beautiful person, no matter your shape or size) is wonderful. And the only thing that matters about her touching you is that it doesn't make YOU squidgy. And you have said that it doesn't.

The fact that the guy got angry when you told him to leave your mom alone is alarming.  Your mom pinched your tush, she didn't grope you.  I've seen that before so I don't think your dynamic worth your mom is all that uncommon. This guy calling you the bad name was completely off.

This doesn\u2019t sound weird or inappropriate to me, though I can see where some with a more modest upbringing would be bothered by it.

Then he took it to another level and got angry and inappropriate. NTA.", "NTA. It's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with your mother's behavior, but it's also important to recognize that different families have different dynamics and ways of showing affection. While it may be uncomfortable for some people, it sounds like your mother's behavior comes from a place of love and wanting to boost your confidence.\n\nIn this situation, the guy who confronted your mother and used a derogatory slur towards you is the ahole. It's not okay for him to use derogatory language towards you or to confront your mother about her behavior. It's important for people to communicate their boundaries and discomfort in a respectful manner, without resorting to name-calling or derogatory language.\n\nIt's important for you to have open and honest communication with your mother about how her behavior makes you feel, and to establish clear boundaries moving forward. While your mother's behavior may not be intended to harm you, it's important for her to understand your perspective and respect your boundaries. Ultimately, it's up to you to determine what behavior you're comfortable with and to communicate that to those around you.", "I would think your mom's behavior is off the chart weird.

Your mom sounds like a peach and you said it has never bothered you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that she pinched your butt, honestly.
