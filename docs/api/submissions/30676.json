He took the day off to help take care of you and the kids while you all have been sick, and help keep up the house, NOT to play games with his friends. Playing games with his friends is not helping you out with the kids or doing dishes or doing laundry. BE a husband, BE the kids father.", ">I also got messages as I was typing this from his friends saying I should let him play. \n\noh hell no. Are his friends 12 years old? NTA", "NTA. Could you have handled it better and not snapped? Sure. Are you an asshole for wanting him to do more? Absolutely not. If he were taking a straight up intentional Vacation then okay maybe playing games would be fine but he took the day off specifically to help you out and he\u2019s done basically nothing.", "Adding an edit in the comments..\nWhen he came to ask about playing games, it was to ask me to watch the 3y so he could\n\nEditing to add more information \n \nHe hasn't been taking care of me for 5 days. The kids and I have been sick for 5 days. He's been working. I didn't ask him to take time off, he offered since I am immune compromised and struggling to shake the illness. \nI am also a gamer. We agreed when the oldest was born that games are after kids are sleeping/on the weekends once housewife has been done. \n\nIf one of the jobs had been actually completed and I wasn't trying to get some rest it probably wouldn't have been so big of a deal. But he woke me and the 1y/o by bringing the 3y/o who doesn't day nap anymore into the bedroom to leave him with me. \nIdk abt y'all but I can't nap AND watch a toddler", "Nope nope nope nope nope. NTA. \n\nLet me rephrase what you just said\n\n> I COULD work myself to the bone watching 2 sick children while I myself am sick and immunocompromised just so that my husband can play video games online with his friends like he does daily, but I wanted to get some rest. Does that make me an asshole?\n\nYour husband is a narcissist and an asshole, and his friends are also either assholes or they've been told a very different story than what you wrote here. \n\nHe's a parent of 2 kids, just because you're a stay at home doesn't mean that he should be allowed to take off work and do nothing, especially when you AND THE KIDS are sick. Disgusting behavior, completely disgusting.", "NTA. You and your kids have been sick for days. You needed help (i.e., you had to call in sick to your SAH job). Maybe I\u2019d feel differently if he decided to play for a bit after he\u2019d cleaned the house spotless and while everyone was napping. But clearly there\u2019s more to catch up on around the house and one of your young children was awake and needed watching while you slept.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, that's so weird to me. When I'm feeling sick, my husband takes over the housework, sometimes all of it. I do as much as I can. Also, if my husband is sick, I do the majority of the housework, he only does as much as he's able to do.  I have a compromised immune system, so honestly all in all he's doing more. But that's not the point.\n\nThe point is, everybody does as much as they can. It's so wild to me, that it's even a question to take off the load of the partners shoulders, when the partner is sick.\n\nIn my opinion, your husband dumps a lot of the mental load and of the actual housework on you, regardless of your health status. He's a husband and father. Especially  as a father it is a fact, that the wellbeing of the children always comes first and his desires come second. Loading this all on you is neglecting his parental duty.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is selfish if he sees how sick you and the kids are and he\u2019s going to play games with his friends. If he took time off to help, and not as a vacation, then he needs to contribute. The friends texting you is shitty too - do none of these people have any compassion for how sick y\u2019all are?\n\nYour husband is throwing a fit because he didn\u2019t get his way, you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. It would be different if he helped out a ton, checked if you were feeling well enough to look after the kids, then contacted his friends. But he didn\u2019t, seems like he was planning to play games all along.", "I'm an avid gamer but I'd not dream of gaming if my kids were ill.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA he took the day off to help you with the kids not sit around and play games all day. He can play games another time.", "NTA because he had agreed to take care of the older child only to renege on it once his friends called.  He should have told them no so the fact that he \"already told his friends he would play\" makes him the AH, not you.\n\nWere it not for this, I would have said N A H. Each one of you thought you were taking the day off and expected some R&R time, which is not unreasonable.", "NTA. He can't be playing games and attending to the children at the same time. Anyone who has ever been near kids know this.", "NTA\n\nThe person taking the day off from their work is YOU. You are not healthy enough to do your work, which is usually to take care of your house and your kids. So you are taking the day off and resting.\n\nYour husband is missing his work because he needs to cover you on yours. He cannot play games because there is no one to watch your kids while he does because you are not working today BECAUSE YOU ARE SICK.", "NTA What is it like,  if he is sick? Does he look for the children then, does he do lots of the homework and let you play games? I mean, he could, because if he is sick he has no work to do, why not run the house then? Of course not, I\u00b4  m pretty sure, if he is sick, you do even more, take care for him and he can rest and do nothing and get healthy again. So it is just natural, that you can do the same. You are sick and have to have rest to get better, he has do do the chores and take care for also HIS children and not playing games. His friends seem not to have a family, or they are the same kind of careless people like your husband. Hope you will get better soon! Wish you all the best.", "This is why I REFUSE to be with a gamer. I have nothing against the games themselves. It\u2019s that every \u201cgamer\u201d I\u2019ve known puts their games above their families and/or careers. It\u2019s a form of escapism and it\u2019s NEVER just an hour here or there. There\u2019s nothing worse than being a single mom when the dad is in the next room playing. I\u2019ve seen it SO many times. This actually goes for any hobby that they use as an excuse to not be involved, like golf or fishing or whatever. ANYTHING but take care of the house and children or SICK WIFE.", "Nta you are sick and he's supposed to be there in support of the household and you and the kids.\n\nBut on the flip side of this. There's only so much someone can do. If laundry in the wash cycle or drying, the dishes are done, and you and the baby are sleeping. Why not play a few rounds of a game until you're awake?", "NTA. Did he complete the list? I'm gonna guess no. If you're sick, you're sick.\n\nIf he did the majority of chores, I'd say Y T A. However, if he basically pawned the kids off on you after 20 minutes, you are in the clear.\n\n1 thing stuck out to me was the he could have done better. INFO on that. Didn't do the chores your way or barely did anything?", "ESH. He should have the awareness and maturity to understand what help and support actually looks like, and OP should let him enjoy at least part of his day off, because why shouldn\u2019t he? The snapping at him wasn\u2019t great, but of course he was acting a little like a kid. It says a lot that OP can forbid him to play games and that he can throw a tantrum about it. OP is not HIS mom. This doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy adult relationship.", "YTA \u2026\n\nHe works and earned leave\u2026 So long as he\u2019s not cheating, and saves some for family vacations and the like what he does with that leave is up to him. He took the day off to help out a bit, and by your own admission he did just that. You didn\u2019t have an issue with him being home, it\u2019s only an issue when he wants to enjoy his time off a little bit. That makes YTA. \n\nWould it be nice if he helped a bit more? Sure. Doesn\u2019t change that YTA here though. I mean seriously it\u2019s day 5, which implies he\u2019s been taking care of you and helping out for 5 days now. A bit of game time after a week isn\u2019t a huge ask imo.\n\nAlso I keep seeing terms like \u201callowed\u201d and \u201cpermission\u201d being used in reference to him taking a day off or playing games. To be frank the implication that he needs permission to take a day off or play a game with the boys is ridiculous. You\u2019re his wife not his mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're sick, and he doesn't sound like Prince Charming, but it sounds like he gets the job done.  \n\nHe's been caring for you for five days and just asking for some self-care.  It shouldn't be too much to ask if all the chores are handled or can be handled later.", "Also, when he promised his friend he would play he already knew his sick wife was trying to sleep and wanted him to watch the kid.

He's just a selfish dick", "Same here, my husband and I love gaming and play all the time, but we would never put it above the needs of our family. Thats downright selfish to do so.", "If the 3y/o would nap with me and the 1y/o it wouldn't be an issue. He woke me to pass off three 3y/o in order to play games", "Because there is another young child that isn't sleeping", "Barely did them\nHe put one load of laundry in. But didn't hang out/put in the dryer the already washed clothes. Left them in the basket and washed a handful of dishes. Meaning a 4 of the 6 plates. Half of the cutlery etc. \nJust all round not completing either task", "He hasn't been helping for a week, he just took a day off, half assed some laundry and washed 4 dishes per op. Saying \"as long as he's not cheating\" is really fucking stupid. Also, sure he could techincally do anything he wants with his leave, but he's married and has 2 young kids. He's got a responsibility to his family to use some time to care for sick kids.", "Which he did, the issue was only when he tried to do something for himself. \n\nIf someone is sick for a couple days I\u2019m all about helping them out. At 5 days they need to man up (or women up I guess) and deal with their shit. \n\nMaybe he only took the one day, even if that\u2019s the case it doesn\u2019t matter. He helped out a bit and then wanted to relax a bit which is perfectly reasonable. \n\nIf I\u2019m the husband and I\u2019m bitched out for wanting to relax for a bit you can be 100% sure it\u2019s the last time I take a day to help out.", "It doesn't seem like he has been doing the caring and it definitelydoewnt sound like hee been doign ti for 5 days. Sounds like he just took the day. Barely contributing then expecting his sick wife to continue to do all the childcare so he can \"relax\" is actually NOT reasonable. If he would never help again when she expects him to actually use the day to help, she needs to dump his ass (and anyone who thinks that never helping again after barely doing anything and being asked to parent their child while their wife is sick is a major fucking asshole - you included.)", "At the risk of being downvoted more lol, she\u2019s a stay at home mom. It\u2019s literally her job to do those things\u2026 If she\u2019s been so sick that after 5 days she still needs help perhaps she should see a doctor so she can say more than \u201cI\u2019m sick\u201d\u2026. or learn to deal like everyone else does. \n\nGot Covid or Cancer? Alright that changes things significantly. But \u201cI\u2019m sick\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m unwell\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it after 5 days imo. \n\nAlso let\u2019s remember that she wasn\u2019t sick and having to do all this work he refused to do. I didn\u2019t see anything indicating he was making her do anything, nor that he wasn\u2019t planning on doing more later (perhaps after the laundry load ran and he\u2019d played a few rounds)\u2026. She wasn\u2019t busting her ass while sick while he did nothing. That would be quite different if that was the case. Alas, she was napping. Nothing wrong with napping but let\u2019s not act like she\u2019s being beat down here. \n\nHe did some work around the house, exactly what is hard to say due to vague language but it\u2019s clear he did some work. (Laundry & dishes at the minimum). Around this time she went for a nap, and finding his buddies online he decided to play a few rounds while she slept. \n\nNow, MAYBE he barged in and loudly interrupted her nap to say \u201cYou\u2019re watching the kid while I do me.\u201d \u2026  But more likely he brought the kid in intending for them to nap as well while he played a game for an hour. \n\nEither way we\u2019ll have to disagree."]}
