He was a widower when we met and he had two young children who were 7 and 8 at the time of our marriage. I always did my best to be a good stepmom and we had an okay relationship over the years. I admit, sometimes I hoped they would view me more than just stepmom, but never expected to be mom. A true parent to them is more what I would hope they would see me as. Because I believe parents can be more than just mom and dad. But I know I never got to that in their hearts. I am stepmom who is more dad's wife in their eyes. I accept that. We had our ups and downs. I went to therapy at times when my feelings were hurt and I didn't want to let it be a burden on my husband or children. I married a widower. I married a man with kids. I knew going in that I was going to meet them where they were at.\n\nBoth of my stepchildren have children of their own. Both of them have gone a more traditional route of naming their children after family members. Both have honored their mom and dad and their parents in law with their first two children. My stepdaughter, the younger of my stepchildren, recently had her third child and she named her after her two grandmothers and her husband's two grandmothers. When she announced the name on social media she commented that all the most important women in their lives had been honored now and my stepson agreed with her.\n\nMy feelings came up about that and I spoke to my family about it. Just saying how it did sting though I was still happy for them and glad I got to be in their lives. My husband came home and overheard me. He was angry that I didn't talk to him. He said we're married and I should come to him. I told him I did not feel it fair to bring it up to him because this is not something that can or anyone should attempt to change. He told me it's relevant because they are his children and I am his wife and he could speak to them. I told him that would not help at all. He still seems upset with me. And maybe I should have confided in him. But I never wanted him to try and force my stepkids to change how they feel about me. That never works.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680096194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125nzns/aita_for_confiding_in_my_family_and_not_my_husband/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it seems more like you are grieving the loss of a life you wanted. Perhaps kids of your own who really looked at you like a mother. In this case the kids never really looked at you that way and it's hard because you did your best.\n\nYour husband's comments were rude and insensitive so let's get that off the table.\n\nUltimately I feel for you because this is a hard place to be.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nand the thing is...it isn't the names, it is the comment about the most important women....it was hurtful and just not needed.\n\nYou sound like you have tried hard over the years to do what it is best for them.\n\nYour husband wants to protect you which is somewhat admirable....but he needs to focus on just supporting you in the way you want. \n\nMaybe the 2 of you can do some counselling together", "NTA", "NTA.

There is nothing to be done.", "NTA \nHis reaction in not ok. He should be exploring why you don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to him about this issue, not getting mad about it. His feelings are hurt and he\u2019s getting defensive instead of showing vulnerability and willingness to change. Dude needs a therapist.", "NTA.\nYou wanted to vent. Husband wants to fix. But you are correct. Confronting them on this is not the way to go. It only creates a divide", "NTA I think you were being considerate by not saying something negative to him about his kids, especially when it\u2019s not something he can do anything about and could harm their attitude towards you and him if he tried anyways. But I do wonder - when you say your family, do you mean that you confided in a close relative or were you openly sharing it with a group? Because the former reads like seeking comfort, the latter could come across to him like you are trashing his kids to your family (I don\u2019t think you are, just pointing out that it may appear to him that way if you told more than one person).", "NTA. Just because we love our SO dearly doesn't mean they are necessarily the ones who can support us how we need in a specific moment. And as you went to therapy and they didn't have you tell him there's probably a reason. I get him being upset, but maybe explain that it's not a lack of trust just needing a different type of support than he normally gives.", "NTA.\n\nYou did exactly the right thing with that particular issue.  You're right - a discussion isn't going to change things.  He wants to defend you, but having him sit them down and ask/demand that one of the middle names be changed to yours isn't going to work, and you know it.  Even if it did, knowing that they were arm-twisted into it isn't exactly going to give you what you emotionally want.\n\nYou're doing fine, Stepmom.", "NTA. You NEED a person to talk to who is not your husband. Your family will often defend your partner, help you understand their actions, allow you to fully express feelings that you might be ashamed of having, etc.\n\nIt obviously hurts to be left out, even if it doesn't make anyone a bad guy. You are right not to dump that on your husband, if you don't see how he can make any changes to improve the situation.\n\nYour husband CAN talk to his children and remind them that you have been an important part of their life and that you care about them/are proud of them. That requires a lot of delicacy and tact--if he is capable, maybe let him try. \n\nAlso, are you Grandma to the grandkids? If so, that shows respect and care. Hold onto that.", "NTA.  I was prepared to read a story about how you took your marital problems outside the marriage instead of talking to your husband, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here.

You\u2019re a great stepmother.", "The title is so misleading! as I read your post I saw you never tried to replace their mom, justified in hurt feelings & I respect you didn\u2019t goto  him because it\u2019d erase all the good attempts you\u2019ve made.

But you're not being really fair to your husband by not confiding.", "I'm going to go with a super soft YTA.  Your husband is right that you should be able to share anything with him.  He shouldn't be in the dark about a hurt so personal.\n\nA ton of people here are jumping on the \"he could speak to them\" statement.  Could is an offer, not a promise to action.  If you don't want him to he should respect that.  If he doesn't, that's a problem.  But, how would he even know if you want it or not if you don't talk to him?  What if he assumed you'd be hurt (it's not unreasonable to think he might figure that out on his own) and decided to talk to his kids about it?\n\nDo you know how he feels about his kids making that statement?

But there is part of me that loves my stepchildren so much that knowing the love isn't entirely returned leaves a stinging sensation. I think this is just one of the things you have to accept when you love another person and their children.

They just don't feel the same for me as I do for them and I am not one of the most important people in their lives. That isn't wrong. It's just how it works sometimes. Not everyone will feel the same and they don't treat me badly or dismissively by any means.", "Of course they don't have to. I'd never asked to be. And being a stepmom can be different depending on the relationship and closeness. I know people who consider stepparents as true parents if not the same, others who see them as not parents, some see them as just their parents spouse and others are a bit more of a mix of everything. I'd have liked to have been the closest type. But I would never put that out there to guilt them. It would have been nice is all.", "I was upset. But that is on me. Not something that should be forced to change because it's just the reality of how things are. Doesn't mean I don't want to talk about it sometimes.", "cause she doesn't want anyone to intercede. she acknowledges that her stepdaughter is allowed to feel this way and understands that stepdaughter's actions weren't intended to be mean to OP but loving towards those women.\n\nhim saying something to his kids wouldn't help- either in this situation or her relationship with them.", "Awesome.", "No. He was mad he wasn't allowed to fix it.", "I think OP knows her husband better than any of us, and if after 22 years of marriage she chose to not confide in him about her feelings that she had valid reason. My guess is this has happened previously and the husband just goes to the kids and tries to make them feel bad, which clearly hasn\u2019t worked considering the current situation.", "You shouldn't have really expected for your step children to treat you as their mother, ofcourse it depends on person to person. If they already knew their mom, it's less likely they'll accept a step mom. If my mom died and my dad remarried I won't accept that woman as my mom, ever. Unless me and my mom had bad blood.", "I understand, thank you for clarifying.", "Except in this case, they made a public comment that was hurtful and I think just about anyone else would be hurt as well. You are well within your right to handle this however you want, but it would not be the worst thing if they were gently encouraged to be more thoughtful in the future.", "If you want to talk about it sometimes then do so with your husband.  You can vent to him without it becoming an issue in the family.  It\u2019s part of his job as your husband to let you vent.  Be careful though.  Make sure he knows it\u2019s just venting and don\u2019t say anything you\u2019ll regret.  They are his daughters.", "Sigh, I'll say it again.  HE IS NOT INTERCEDING.  HE OFFERED TO INTERCEDE.  IT IS NOT THE SAME THING.  HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS UNTIL SHE TELLS HIM.  I prefer to believe that he'd respect her wishes once he knows them.\n\nHeck, OP can tell us if he did, since he obviously now both knows about the situation and her desire for him to not talk to the kids.\n\nAnd now, my lord I'm done with this entire thread where everyone assumes he's going to charge in guns blazing damn what she wants because he's the man and men just give a shit about being heroes and fixers.", "You're reading his mind?  OP doesn't even assert that, and she knows him way better than we do.", "You're assuming all kinds of facts not in evidence.", "I didn't. I knew I would never be their mother.

I'm glad they still have some memories of their mother.", "She felt more comfortable talking with her family about it, who is also part of her support system. Regardless of what her reasoning for being more comfortable is, her husband is not entitled to be the only support she utilizes. You shouldn't only depend on your spouse for emotional support, it isn't their job and it isn't healthy.", "But if OP wanted to have a talk with step-daughter she could have done so one her own. They're both adults. She doesn't need someone to offer to intercede. Sometimes you just need to express that a situation sucks for you in order to get it off your chest and not let it fester. When someone then starts telling you how to resolve the issue or interceding on your behalf it comes across as infantilizing at best. It's as if the other person doesn't acknoweledge you as a capable adult. It's reasonable for husband to be upset and hurt that OP wants to confide in someone else and not him, but it's not reasonable for him to be angry. OP probably expected the anger and offers to intercede from past experience with husband, and just wanted to be able to be able to let this go and move on without having to deal with that.", "Right, she know him better than us and decided not to tell him. So OP knows better than everyone saying NTA but not better than you?", "OP says she\u2019s been in therapy, this has clearly been a struggle for a long time and due to the length of her marriage it\u2019s safe to assume she initially went to her husband with her issues and determined a professional was a better choice. Regardless, OP isn\u2019t required to tell her husband shit. Her feelings aren\u2019t about him, her feelings are her own, and she can vent to whomever she wishes.", "I would be so damn hurt. I'm sorry \ud83d\ude14", "> I went to therapy at times when my feelings were hurt and I didn't want to let it be a burden on my husband or children\n\nGiven this and the rest of her current post, I'd say your assumption isn't safe.\n\nAnd I'm not saying she's required to tell anyone anything.  But marriage should be a life partnership, better worse, blah blah blah.  You should be able to get through anything with your spouse.  He seems to be hurt that she felt she couldn't do that with him.  I'd be hurt if my wife went to someone else before me about something,  It's my job to be there for her no matter what.  I take my job seriously.", "I\u2019ve been with my husband for 13 years, we have been through 2 premature births, a permanent and life altering medical diagnosis, deaths, and a shit ton of family trauma and drama in the span of those 13 years. I love him to death and he is my world and best friend, but I also have not confided in him every struggle I have faced internally. It doesn\u2019t mean I love him less or that I think he isn\u2019t capable of sharing my burdens, it means I\u2019m an adult who can face things on my own and sometimes I need to or want to. This burden is the wife\u2019s to carry if that\u2019s what she chooses, and she is, she can still love her husband and not always confide in him. He is allowed to feel hurt, but that doesn\u2019t make her TA."]}
