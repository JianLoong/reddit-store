We had our ups and downs. I went to therapy at times when my feelings were hurt and I didn't want to let it be a burden on my husband or children. I married a widower. I married a man with kids. I knew going in that I was going to meet them where they were at.\n\nBoth of my stepchildren have children of their own. Both of them have gone a more traditional route of naming their children after family members. Both have honored their mom and dad and their parents in law with their first two children. My stepdaughter, the younger of my stepchildren, recently had her third child and she named her after her two grandmothers and her husband's two grandmothers. When she announced the name on social media she commented that all the most important women in their lives had been honored now and my stepson agreed with her.\n\nMy feelings came up about that and I spoke to my family about it. Just saying how it did sting though I was still happy for them and glad I got to be in their lives. My husband came home and overheard me. He was angry that I didn't talk to him. He said we're married and I should come to him. I told him I did not feel it fair to bring it up to him because this is not something that can or anyone should attempt to change. He told me it's relevant because they are his children and I am his wife and he could speak to them. I told him that would not help at all. He still seems upset with me. And maybe I should have confided in him. But I never wanted him to try and force my stepkids to change how they feel about me.

Almost never was that person my husband, who is never entitled to all the thoughts in my head, and was himself too emotionally invested in the situation to objectively help me process them.\n\nI see you acknowledging how you feel without blowing the family up by making it about you.

People on this sub always seem to put effort into empathizing with the OP but don\u2019t try to do the same for others in the story. Her husband got home and overheard that his wife has been upset for essentially decades about how their children don\u2019t consider her a parent, and also heard her being really gracious about it and thankful to just be in their lives, but ultimately just very hurt. He probably just feels like shit. His wife has been hurting for years and he didn\u2019t realize it, and now he\u2019s trying to make up for it by getting protective and trying to fix it. It\u2019s ultimately from a place of love and guilt that he hasn\u2019t helped her through this before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to act like he\u2019d have stomped all over her boundaries if he\u2019d been looped in all along.

I personally think that the stepdaughter is an asshole for making that post.

We don't know the whole story of course, but if someone's treated you well for many years generally you would have some measure of love for them.\n\nAlso that Facebook post sounds like a shot at her to me.

OP seems to have tried really hard to not put her hurt feelings and expectations on her step kids, which I applaud her for.

They may think everything is just great and never stopped to think that maybe their stepmom wishes she was considered a little more than their dad\u2019s wife after raising them for over a decade and being a loving presence in their lives for 22 years.

It hurts a little every so often even when you do things financially / emotionally to support those children, they will still not see you as the replacement parent.

Is the easier assumption that these kids are just assholes, rather than she\u2019s not going into the deeper issues here? I would guess that, if they have an issue with her, it\u2019s because of unresolved situations that she is not acknowledging or getting into here is all. I\u2019m just saying it happens, and idk if I would just jump to the kids being dicks for no reason.", "I think that\u2019s the thing though, she\u2019s a bit of a non-entity to them. She\u2019s always around and she\u2019s very nice to them, but she isn\u2019t family. I doubt it\u2019s personal, but they weren\u2019t looking to expand their inner circle. If anything, it sounds like they want to tighten and condense their inner circle. It\u2019s quite something to name all your children after immediate family members. These kids lost their mother young and now they are clinging onto their closest living relatives as tight as they can and they aren\u2019t letting go or letting anyone else in. I think it\u2019s sad for everyone involved, but I doubt they\u2019ve ever thought twice about how OP feels about it all.\n\nETA - that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s step kids aren\u2019t being casually cruel here. They are adults. OP is the mother of their half siblings. They should be thoughtful and considerate of her feelings. There are many ways to show someone you care about them and value their place in your life without elevating them to the role of a mother figure and I think that is all OP is really looking for here."]}
