You need to speak up. Definitely do it at a time when you feel calm -- don't lash out in rage with barbed words. Pick a calm time to tell him you need some time for yourself and ask him to work with you on when.

Drop off and pick up are usually another 45 minutes - 1 hour.", "Just because you have plenty of time doesn\u2019t mean other stay at home moms too. I know of at least 2 SAHMs in my life that have nonstop days. Hell, back when I was a teenager I had a step-aunt who was a SAHM whose husband had her scrub the house from top to bottom every day. She had literally no time to herself. And just because your kids can get themselves ready in the morning, doesn\u2019t mean her kids can get themselves ready. Plus, if she was to do more prep at night, that would be her working a late night every night when her husband isn\u2019t. Which would mean she would deserve having him help in the morning even more.", "Dude, right? Working parents also have to cook, clean, take care of pets, spend time with their children. This whole idea that a stay at home parent doesn\u2019t have more free time than a working parent, particularly once the kids are in school, is so stupid. Literally everyone with two functional neurons can see through it.", "Unless you\u2019re going to a spa, a shower is not me-time. It\u2019s something everyone needs to do. And even if a shower did count as downtime, it certainly doesn\u2019t add up to the calm morning he\u2019s getting. And it especially doesn\u2019t count if she has to do it before she leaves the house to take the kids to school in the morning. Because that means she has to get up even earlier just to have that measly moment.", "And unless he's completely hands off in the house he helps out when he's not at work in the evenings", "Except for the hour after they leave to clean up the morning child hurricane and the hour before they come home getting ready for the return. Then you know the housework that needs to be done.", "She\u2019s not whining, she wants to be treated equally. Just because you couldn\u2019t manage to ask that for yourself, doesn\u2019t mean she should have to settle. Stop being bitter about how crappy your life was as a stay at home mom. And it\u2019s incredibly hypocritical to call someone else lazy for wanting some time to themselves, when you freely admit to doing absolutely nothing.", "It\u2019s auto generated. But thank you", "It's not about credit those things are part of being an adult and if you chose to stay home and not work it's only fair that you do more of those things than the person that does work", "Sure thing trolley troll troll trollerson. I'll get right on that fakey Mc fake profile.", "> This whole idea that a stay at home parent doesn\u2019t have more free time than a working parent, particularly once the kids are in school, is so stupid. Literally everyone with two functional neurons can see through it.\n\nEspecially now that modern technology has made everything  so much easier. \n\nVacuum cleaners, washing machines, and dishwashers have significantly cut down the amount time it takes to maintain a household.", "And then she would be here complaining that he gets home late from work because he's working out it's the same issue just at a different time in the day", "What do you think the rest of us do after each parent has done a full day's work?\n\nAn hour to clean up in the morning and an hour to \"get ready\" for kids coming home? Spare me. That's complete nonsense.", "Treated equally how? The request here is for the husband to have a job and help around the house. The house is supposed to be her job. The end.", "Hey don't look at me I did it all while working full time. I am just pointing out the job doesn't end just because the kids aren't home.", "I think they\u2019re just saying that the information presented was exaggerated - is there really 1 hour of recovery from departure and 1 hour of prep for return? I\u2019d argue it\u2019s about 1 hour total.", "Guess it depends on how lazy your kids are lol. My kids started doing chores age appropriate when they were 3. Just little things like toys away before bed. Match the shoes. My son was obsessed with sock matching the weirdo. He started matching them when he was 3 so he could juggle them. But all those little things cut my work load way down."]}
