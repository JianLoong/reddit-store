Start your own routine in the evening and let him put the kids to bed.", "Other people in this comment section are correct. NAH. Festering resentment is unhealthy, especially with someone you live with. Please have a healthy discussion with your SO.", "What do you do after the kiddos are off to school?", "NAH, did you not discuss this before you became a stay at home mom? This seems pretty similar to other parents I know (including my sister). SAHM, she gets the kids ready, feeds the pups. What do you do during the day while your children are at school and your husband is at work?", "INFO:  How old are the kids? Once they're off to school what do you do?", "YTA, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to be in the minority here, but I was also a SAHM for a portion of my kids\u2019 childhoods, so I feel I have perspective, and I think you\u2019re being ridiculous. He\u2019s not playing video games. Your kids are going to school. On school days, this is the job you wanted. You\u2019re supposed to handle the before/after routine. If you don\u2019t want this job, get another one and THEN, you may actually have a leg to stand on with this argument.\n\nPlus, you can still have that gorgeous relaxing morning after they go to school.", "NTA\n\nIf you feel you're having a hard time, maybe have a talk with him tell him how somedays you want a day off too", "Is your whole day booked? Why can't you do things after the kids go to school?", "NTA\n\nBeing a mother of young kids, especially as a SAHM, can be incredibly stressful, lonely, and isolating. Adjusting to the ever-changing habits and routines of your kids can seem all-encompassing, more so because most of the work falls to you.\n\nIt's really, really hard but really, really important to try to make time for yourself. Whether it's a workout or a long bath or an hour in a quiet room with a book or a hobby -- carving out this time to focus on your interests, health, and relaxation will make you a better mom and wife.\n\nThere are resentments in marriage that can be slept on and snuffed out. If you keep your mouth shut when you're seething and see how you feel in a few days, you'll often be glad you didn't speak when your wrath was peaking. But this isn't one of those. You need to speak up. Definitely do it at a time when you feel calm -- don't lash out in rage with barbed words. Pick a calm time to tell him you need some time for yourself and ask him to work with you on when. You don't offer much detail about your husband, which hopefully means he isn't the sort of selfish working father who thinks only he is entitled to a life outside the home and/or parenthood. Your whole life will seem palpably better if you can get this time for you.", "NTA. I would talk to him about how you\u2019re splitting up responsibilities and see if you can find a new routine that work for both of you.", "NTA sit him down and tell him how you feel. And don't let his stand back up from that seat until you have both come to a decision on what to do going forward", "NTA time for a conversation about the division of labor. You are doing way too much if your stressed and he\u2019s having a leisurely go of it.", "YTA  I'm assuming the kids are in school the full day? Why can't you go for a cycle and swim after the kids go to school and your husband is at work?", "NTA, you guys just gotta talk it through and establish some ground rules", "NTA. You have quite a full plate and it sounds like hubby isn't making it easier. Have a heart to heart conversation with him. Maybe work out him helping a few days a week so you can de-stress. (And for all you people saying SAHM isn't a real job or isn't hard work have never experienced what its like to parent.)", "YTA. That\u2019s you JOB. Then they head to school while HE is slogging through a full workday.\n\nYou have - oh, five hours? All to yourself.", "YTA", "YTA, you would resent him if he was out of shape or didn't work. It takes me all of five minutes to feed and clean up after the animals. Getting the kids out the door takes more time than feeding and dressing them. Somebody always forgets something. Meal prepping at night and having bags staged by the door helps out a lot. Everything is ready to go the night before. Sucks but it goes fast, plus, you get gorgeous relaxing days to enjoy grocery shopping solo. That's my favorite time in the world.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids could be 2 or 15, the fact is the husband is skipping out on the household work in favor of doing his own thing instead of helping with his own family.", "I also wondered if the guy is training/does something like triathlons. If thats the case then OP- YTA\u2026my son and his father both train mornings and afternoons before and after work/school. I find it incredibly driven and amazing to see that kind if discipline especially in my young son (both live in different states so its on each of them to do this themselves). \nId rather see a healthy active human doing something that is beneficial", "[deleted]", "So much drama. Her kids are in school. She has HOURS every day.\nShe should get a J.O.B.

It\u2019s **exhausting**. \n\nBefore typical work hours parenting needs to be divided equally, otherwise the SAHM is essentially \u201cworking\u201d from the second she gets up with the kids to the second they go to bed, and even then you most likely need to do chores you couldn\u2019t during the day. Her partner gets to have a relaxing morning, go to work and relax when he\u2019s back home. \n\nAsking for him to help a few times a week isn\u2019t insanity.

Hopefully you can find someone who would want to start a family with you one day, it's a dynamic and challenging job, but the most rewarding one I ever had. Better than anything I was getting paid to do. I wouldn't trade it for the world, being able to look through the eyes of another. I love my children more than anything in the world, I hope you get to experience that for yourself in time.", "Maybe he could swim after work some days. As an example of one possible compromise", "Yea she a stay at home mom for her kids that she had with her husband. Also has pets that are also her husband responsibility. It is up to each couple what is a good balance for them. Who knows how helpful op husband is when he gets off work. \n\nIts not back in the old days were just because the woman is a stay at home means they need to handle everything with their kids and house because their husband have work.
