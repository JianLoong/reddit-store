We have a lot in common in very niche areas. We\u2019ve gotten close and he even made a remark about needing to find an engagement ring.\n\nNeither of us drive and he lives 2 hours away, so I asked him if he\u2019d be willing to take a bus down and stay for the weekend, and he said yes. He\u2019s unemployed so I paid for his 2 way ticket. \n\n I asked my couple friends, Sky and Ethan, if they\u2019d be willing to kick it the night he came to town and go out for a double date.  \n\nJason arrived on Friday and we had a few hours before Sky and Ethan would be done with work and we both opened up more and it felt amazing. \n\nOn the double date, there were a few minor things I noticed that were weird. He forgot his wallet, and even though I didn\u2019t mind paying he  got into it with the bartender. Other than that,  everyone got along. \n\nWhen we were back, we ended up getting intimate, and he asked me if I wanted to be his exclusive girlfriend. I said yes.\n\nThis morning, Jason makes a comment that he noticed a call from a number he doesn\u2019t have saved. He  says he didn\u2019t remember giving any girl his number last night. (Weird?) He calls it and it was a girl who said she showed up at his house last night at 11pm and was confused why he wasn\u2019t there. He was being very flirty, and said \u201cdid you miss me\u201d and I was so uncomfortable.\n\nLater, he starts detailing several recent disputes with law enforcement he\u2019s involved in. He also says he had been hanging out with a friend and sending her money, and she had been sneaking into his house. Her boyfriend got upset and it culminated into him stealing from his property. I said that the boyfriend was was justified in being upset because the relationship seemed inappropriate, but that the retaliation was unjustified. He started yelling. His eyes went completely black, and I had a gut feeling something was wrong. I placated him and tried to continue with the conversation. \n\nI went to the bathroom and texted friends because I felt unsafe. I rescheduled his bus ticket to leave tonight. Jason went outside to take a call shortly after. He came back inside and says there was an issue at his place but his friend and her baby were staying with him so it was fine. He made no mention of this before.\n\nEthan, who is a bouncer said he could come by. Another friend, Elton, who lives close said he could too and we walked inside and pretended we had run into each other when I was outside on the phone. \n\nI  texted Ethan to let me know when he got here. When he showed up, I asked Jason if I could talk to him outside, explained that he had really frightened me and that I thought it was best that he go home. He started to deny what happened and said women always do this to him. \n\nEventually, he agreed to go. I called him an Uber, forwarded him the rescheduled bus ticket.\n\nDespite feeling supported by friends, I feel bad that I put Jason in a distressing situation by making him leave early.", "created_utc": 1696749020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172ssof/aita_for_kicking_out_a_guy_who_traveled_2_hours/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
