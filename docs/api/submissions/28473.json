We have a lot in common in very niche areas. We\u2019ve gotten close and he even made a remark about needing to find an engagement ring.\n\nNeither of us drive and he lives 2 hours away, so I asked him if he\u2019d be willing to take a bus down and stay for the weekend, and he said yes. He\u2019s unemployed so I paid for his 2 way ticket. \n\n I asked my couple friends, Sky and Ethan, if they\u2019d be willing to kick it the night he came to town and go out for a double date.  \n\nJason arrived on Friday and we had a few hours before Sky and Ethan would be done with work and we both opened up more and it felt amazing. \n\nOn the double date, there were a few minor things I noticed that were weird. He forgot his wallet, and even though I didn\u2019t mind paying he  got into it with the bartender. Other than that,  everyone got along. \n\nWhen we were back, we ended up getting intimate, and he asked me if I wanted to be his exclusive girlfriend. I said yes.\n\nThis morning, Jason makes a comment that he noticed a call from a number he doesn\u2019t have saved. He  says he didn\u2019t remember giving any girl his number last night. (Weird?) He calls it and it was a girl who said she showed up at his house last night at 11pm and was confused why he wasn\u2019t there. He was being very flirty, and said \u201cdid you miss me\u201d and I was so uncomfortable.\n\nLater, he starts detailing several recent disputes with law enforcement he\u2019s involved in. He also says he had been hanging out with a friend and sending her money, and she had been sneaking into his house. Her boyfriend got upset and it culminated into him stealing from his property. I said that the boyfriend was was justified in being upset because the relationship seemed inappropriate, but that the retaliation was unjustified. He started yelling. His eyes went completely black, and I had a gut feeling something was wrong. I placated him and tried to continue with the conversation. \n\nI went to the bathroom and texted friends because I felt unsafe. I rescheduled his bus ticket to leave tonight. Jason went outside to take a call shortly after. He came back inside and says there was an issue at his place but his friend and her baby were staying with him so it was fine. He made no mention of this before.\n\nEthan, who is a bouncer said he could come by. Another friend, Elton, who lives close said he could too and we walked inside and pretended we had run into each other when I was outside on the phone. \n\nI  texted Ethan to let me know when he got here. When he showed up, I asked Jason if I could talk to him outside, explained that he had really frightened me and that I thought it was best that he go home. He started to deny what happened and said women always do this to him. \n\nEventually, he agreed to go. I called him an Uber, forwarded him the rescheduled bus ticket.\n\nDespite feeling supported by friends, I feel bad that I put Jason in a distressing situation by making him leave early.", "created_utc": 1696749020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172ssof/aita_for_kicking_out_a_guy_who_traveled_2_hours/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

RUN!", "38\n\nDoesn't drive\n\nUnemployed\n\nThat's as far as I got NTA", "NTA. Your safety comes before his nonsense. This dude has another woman living in his house, flirts with other women, and gets psycho for no good reason. If you'd kept him around, he likely would have abused you at some point. Those are the reddest flags you can get.", "NTA. Boy has more red flags than a WWII enthusiast. Glad you have a good support system around you because that sounds like a really scary experience.", "NTA. So many red flags there. Don't feel guilty for protecting yourself against someone that sounds like unsafe company.", "NTA. I think we women are brought up to be accommodating to everyone at the expense of our own happiness. THis guy seemed off to you and you were uncomfortable. You did the right thing.", "NTA at all. Safety first.", "You're 24 you have no business with a guy that old, find a guy your age that doesn't have problems with the law", "> I (24F) met a man (38M) Jason\n\nImmediate red flag #1.\n\n> He\u2019s unemployed so I paid for his 2 way ticket.\n\nOop. Red flag #2 just sprouted from the daisies.\n\n> On the double date, there were a few minor things I noticed that were weird. He forgot his wallet, and even though I didn\u2019t mind paying he got into it with the bartender. \n\nRed flags 3 and 4 popping out like two zits on a bad day.\n\n> Jason makes a comment that he noticed a call from a number he doesn\u2019t have saved. He says he didn\u2019t remember giving any girl his number last night. (Weird?) He calls it and it was a girl who said she showed up at his house last night at 11pm and was confused why he wasn\u2019t there. He was being very flirty, and said \u201cdid you miss me\u201d and I was so uncomfortable.\n\n>Later, he starts detailing several recent disputes with law enforcement he\u2019s involved in. He also says he had been hanging out with a friend and sending her money, and she had been sneaking into his house. Her boyfriend got upset and it culminated into him stealing from his property. I said that the boyfriend was was justified in being upset because the relationship seemed inappropriate, but that the retaliation was unjustified. He started yelling. His eyes went completely black, and I had a gut feeling something was wrong. I placated him and tried to continue with the conversation.\n\nI counted FIVE ADDITIONAL RED FLAGS HERE. Five.\n\n> He started to deny what happened and said women always do this to him.\n\nBlock his number, and any ways of him contacting you *now*.\n\nHe is a walking red flag, and the sooner you cut this guy off, the better. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nBlock and move on. This guy is a huge unknown with a bajillion red flags.\n\nYou did the best thing you possibly could have in the situation. Hope he gets the hint and stays the fuck away.", "NTA. You should send him this post so he actually understands what behavior is and isn\u2019t appropriate to be engaged in.", "Honestly thank you so much. The several commenters here are totally right that I shouldn\u2019t have ended up in this situation in the first place, I definitely need to stop giving people the benefit of the doubt. I have a hard time trusting myself so hearing that people think it was handled well in the heat of the moment helps a lot. I just have to better in my overall decision making obviously", "Remember that whatever you witnessed, that was him at his best behaviour. People usually put in an effort when meeting new people, as they should. But if this was his best, he was already failing at that. Well done you, and good riddens. The bullet you dodged flew just past you.", "I hear you.   Be safe out there!", "100%. Like that man who posted \u201caita for not taking my roommate to her appointments\u201d and turns out that was his wife pregnant with his kid.", "Ah, that makes more sense now. Anyway, don't feel bad - you are only 24. That's barely into adulthood - I know I was not that mature at 24 and only felt like I knew a 'lot' of stuff when I was much older.  And when you meet someone you click with weird hormonal stuff goes on in all our heads - it's only natural. :-) All the best!", "So time to look at it that way. This guy is garbage!", "1. Don\u2019t forget to go back and get tested again after 3 months, because some diseases take time before the tests can detect them. \n2. You have a good set of friends who were serious about protecting you. You deserve a partner who also makes you feel safe and supported. You deserve so much better than this guy.", "You were an AH to yourself. First mistake was paying for his bus ticket. If he's unemployed and so broke he can't get to your place on his own, he has no business dating anyone.", "Yes, you saw the pattern and reacted accordingly. One of the things about PTSD is it leaves us in fight/flight/freeze/fawn mode all the time which means we can over-react BUT that hypervigilance also means we're taking in *a lot* of info and sorting it for threats. I've had PTSD for 40 years (ooof.) but I've learned the difference between a traumatic over-reaction and when my gut is right and *must* be listened to. Part of learning it was if my gut says I'm in danger, even if my brain says everything is fine, I get the fuck out of the situation and somewhere safe. I can always apologize later for bouncing if it's my PTSD freaking out, but I can't easily regain my sense of safety if I'm harmed.\n\nAnd you're not susceptible to a specific type, you're a survivor and unfortunately the abuse you survived leaves you vulnerable to abusers in the future. I don't know how but same as survivors seem to sense each other, abusers can too. Then they target us because we're vulnerable to them.\n\nI do want to say, don't lose hope on love, healthy, supportive, amazing love is possible to find. I went from shitty relationships to the next for years until one day getting drunk with a best friend and he hit on me. We're married 23 years in 3 weeks and he is the kindest, gentlest man ever. Such a good husband & step-father that my daughter started saying in her teens that she was looking for *her* version of him.\n\nKeep working your recovery. You did GREAT in this situation, listened to your gut, got yourself safe and didn't let your hopes for something good blind you to the danger. That's *awesome*. Seriously. Like spoil yourself with something lovely for being your own protector awesome.", "He can say a lot of things and not mean them.", "Block him and forget him.   \nHe could be nice and charming, but no way he's a material for an serious partner/husband - in any way. There is so many \"red flags\" about him, that he looks like The Red Square in USSR on May 1st.", "Raise your standards, by a lot.", "Now you're responsible for me leaving AITA (and Redddit) for the long time ;) - just looked a little and was hooked - very interesting and well written :).", "Thank you so much for sharing your experience, I think you\u2019re absolutely amazing for getting through what you did and being strong and resilient enough to grow and begin to trust yourself again. I completely relate\u2014I feel exhausted constantly by everything I\u2019m processing it\u2019s hard to find safety. I hope I can get to a point where I can trust my body to point me in the right direction and heal. Thank you so much for your words of hope and encouragement\u2014 I appreciate everyone\u2019s tough love on this post but I feel kind of devastated by this whole situation despite dodging a bullet and afraid I\u2019ll never find love, so that really means a lot to me. You\u2019re an amazing human <3"]}
