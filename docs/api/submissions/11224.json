Who's being TA here?\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 (34M) and I (36F) have lived together for 1.5 years at this point. I moved into his place because he already had a home and I was still an apartment renter. For some context... this house is a POS. One of the issues that will likely never get resolved is the soundproofing. Or rather, complete lack thereof. Sound carries through this house like you wouldn't believe.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 works a 3 day, 12 hours/day schedule Sun-Tues. I work a traditional M-F 8 hours/day schedule. I also have a 20-30 minute commute and I have to look professional at my job. I am up b/w 5:30-5:45 on workdays. He has always stayed up pretty late on his nights off, sometimes until 4am. His best friend lives in Alaska. With the time difference it's the only time they have to play video games together. I'm very supportive of their friendship. What I'm sick of is being woken up Tues.-Fri. between the hours of midnight and 4am because he's yelling a callout to his buddy and startles me awake. This could be a once a week thing, or it could be multiple times per night/per week. Getting back to sleep for me can take up to an hour.\n\nI have asked him to please lower his volume (not even to a full whisper). I have asked him to please sit on the far side of the couch so he's not directly down from the hallway and the sound can be filtered a bit more. When he does these two things, I can't hear him. It's also only an issue in cold months when I can't run a fan in the room.\n\nHis responses? He never had a problem before (referring to his ex-wife) so it must be me. He doesn't mean to, he just gets caught up in the moment. He ***swears*** he was on that side of the couch and whispering, I'm just such a light sleeper. And of course \"we need to get you some earplugs.\"\n\nI have said to him that me being a light sleeper, etc. is irrelevant. We are adults in an adult relationship sharing a house and it is not unreasonable to ask him to be quiet on my worknights after I go to bed. This happens every week like clockwork, so \"getting caught up\" when it's a regular thing doesn't wash with me, especially when it's never just an outburst and then he quiets down. He will shout and continue to talk at full volume until I get out of bed and go out to glare at him.  My health and wellbeing should matter enough that he doesn't conveniently forget every time he has to shoot a zombie.\n\nNo, I do not want to wear earplugs. 1) I already have anxiety about missing an alarm to the point that I set two every night on two different devices 2) I have ADHD so stimuli can really annoy me to the point of non-sleep, something in my ears sounds like a nightmare 3) I reiterate--we are adults... I should not have to jump through a hoop so he can enjoy his abundance of free time without having to be considerate of me. \n\nSo guys. Who's TA? AITA?\n\nFYI I also game. Not anti-gaming. I just shut the door when I do and keep volumes turned down.", "created_utc": 1677685307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f6z1l/aita_for_being_pissed_my_fianc\u00e9_wont_whisper/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Heck, even my teenage daughter (who games), can manage to do that.\n\nIs there a possibility of hanging up a heavy, sound-dampening curtain in the hallway between the living room and the bedroom. It is amazing what a fabric panel can do.\n\nBut regardless, work (and school), always trumps play. Tell your bf that if he can't be respectful of your need for work and sleep, that you could easily start a tit-for-tat and bang around and turn lights on at 5:30am in the morning.

My stepmom had to make my dad convert a storage room to a game room for the same reason, and I put one in an old house I owned after I had roomies move in. It works well and it's pretty cheap to do. I hope you find a resolution.", "And his argument that it \u201cdidn\u2019t bother his ex-wife\u201d is not the defense he thinks it is, given that she is his ex-wife.

Why should have to put in earplugs for someone who is just being inconsiderate?  I really hope this childish behavior doesn't continue into your marriage otherwise its giving call it off.", "NTA. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request on your part. I also understand that while being immersed in playing a game he might not realize how loud he is at times.

But it\u2019s a really worrying one. This is a health issue for you. Sleep is necessary to live. This is a money issue for you. Sleep deprived people don\u2019t do well at work. And this is just plain respect. You don\u2019t like it and there are easy ways for him to adjust his behavior. \n\nBut he thinks fun time with his friend is more important than your health, employment, and happiness and refuses to compromise even the tiniest bit. If he won\u2019t make this tiny sacrifice over something THIS minor, how will he act when something big comes up later on? Children. Elder care. Major medical issue.

Up to now it's mostly been comments I've made in passing. Something helpful that's come out of this is realizing some of his responses may not be genuine--if he thinks I'm being playful about it, he's going to respond in kind, and I'm taking his responses as serious. Not making an excuse for him, just realizing that unless I actively sit him down and say I'm not playing around, this is a serious issue and red flag so what do you honestly plan to do may give me a clearer read on if he's willing to compromise or if he's going to continue to write it off.", "I mean... obviously ***I*** don't think I am.
