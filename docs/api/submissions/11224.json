I moved into his place because he already had a home and I was still an apartment renter. For some context... this house is a POS. One of the issues that will likely never get resolved is the soundproofing. Sound carries through this house like you wouldn't believe.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 works a 3 day, 12 hours/day schedule Sun-Tues. I work a traditional M-F 8 hours/day schedule. I also have a 20-30 minute commute. I am up by 5:45 on workdays. He has always stayed up late on his nights off, sometimes until 4am. His best friend lives in Alaska. With the time difference it's the only time they have to play video games together. I'm very supportive of their friendship. What I'm sick of is being woken up Tues.-Fri. between the hours of midnight and 4am because he's yelling a callout to his buddy and startles me awake. This could be a once a week thing, or it could be multiple times per night/per week. Getting back to sleep for me can take up to an hour.\n\nI have asked him to please lower his volume. I have asked him to please sit on the far side of the couch so he's not directly down from the hallway and the sound can be filtered a bit more. When he does these two things, I can't hear him. It's also only an issue in cold months when I can't run a fan in the room.\n\nHis responses? He never had a problem before (referring to his ex-wife) so it must be me. He doesn't mean to, he just gets caught up in the moment. He ***swears*** he was on that side of the couch and whispering, I'm just such a light sleeper. And of course \"we need to get you some earplugs.\"\n\nI have said to him that me being a light sleeper, etc. is irrelevant. We are adults in an adult relationship sharing a house and it is not unreasonable to ask him to be quiet on my worknights after I go to bed. This happens every week like clockwork, so \"getting caught up\" when it's a regular thing doesn't wash with me, especially when it's never just an outburst and then he quiets down. He will shout and continue to talk at full volume until I get out of bed and go out to glare at him.  My health and wellbeing should matter enough that he doesn't conveniently forget every time he has to shoot a zombie.\n\nNo, I do not want to wear earplugs. 1) I already have anxiety about missing an alarm to the point that I set two every night on two different devices 2) I have ADHD so stimuli can really annoy me to the point of non-sleep, something in my ears sounds like a nightmare 3) I reiterate--we are adults... I should not have to jump through a hoop so he can enjoy his abundance of free time without having to be considerate of me.\n\nSo guys. Who's TA? AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'll be sitting him down so he knows it's an important convo and big deal. If all you came here to do is ridicule me for not agreeing to end my relationship, go shout into another void.

From your other comments it seems like this is uncharacteristic of him to be this thoughtless/inconsiderate. My husband and I both game, and if we don\u2019t have the mic monitoring on, we both complain about the other talking way too loud/yelling. We also can really get into the game and start yelling, and we don\u2019t realize how bad it is without the mic monitoring throwing it back into our own ears.", "The concept that people will always change if a loved one \u201cmatters enough\u201d is so flawed and has led to so much heartache in my own life as well as the lives of so many people I know. Especially because it can always be reversed (he doesn\u2019t matter enough for her to wear ear plugs and let him enjoy freely). \n\nPeople can love each other deeply and still not be able or willing to change who they are. I am so glad that I stopped buying into that idea because it\u2019s an easy way to waste everyone\u2019s time. The person saying \u201cif you loved me,you would\u2026xyz\u201d is usually covering the fact that they actually don\u2019t like who their partner is but they also don\u2019t want to have to start over with some one new (basically, please change yourself into the person I need you to be so that I can tolerate you)", "Sleep is a human need.\nHe\u2019s denying you a basic human need because he doesn\u2019t want to be a little quieter. . . \n\nThat\u2019s not a small thing OP.

Thats the difference", "OP\u2019s denial is both deep and wide!", "You see, he is inconsiderate. And this is not something that can actually work out in the long run. Bcs he will prioritize himself and his needs over yours, not even try to be better (remember his excuse his ex didn't have a problem with it?), only going to make excuses that YOU are the PROBLEM.  Inconsiderate people are selfish, selfcentered and arrogant. It may seems like something you can with, for now. But it will surely change if you are a person who has alittle bit self-respect. All these thungs will pile up, you are only living with him for 1\u00bd years. Thats still nothing. I lived with my husband for 9, and even though he wasn't really an AH, had good qualities, there were some things i just excused all the time and thought i can live eith this, its not that bad. But i started to rethink, the more time oassed, i questioned myself: do i really want to live and get old with this person? Will i live with all these shortcomings that actually do tick me off, and i knew i would hate it more and more. Just think alittle why do you like him and want to be eith him, and try to imagine to get old with him.", "Because you're ignoring the  issue here. He doesn't seem to care enough about you to do the simplest things to make you happy. You're here on this sub but won't hear the responses. Dont ask the question if you don't want to hear the responses.", "Learning to be quiet during sleeping hours is a basic social skill most people manage to comprehend before puberty.  It just seems unlikely that this is some sort of isolated glitch.", "NTA and if you don't want to run a fan get a white noise machine, it's basically a tiny fan without the gust. They're amazing!", "NTA. I spent years (like 10+) working similar hours to your bf, and at least 18 months of that was night shifts but I totally agree with you. Sure, he can keep odd hours and play games with his mate but he can do it quietly!!!!!", "You can take steps to soundproof the room, fairly easily and cheaply.

Good luck", "op=YTA\n\nhe's supposed to make all the changes to accommodate you.\n\nLook into soundproofing his game room(there are lot of DIY options available).  \n\nBuy a white noise machine.

Every other issue we've had and confronted we've had workable resolution.

So YTA too, congrats.", "Not sure if you will see this or if anyone else brought it up but you mentioned a fan in the summer. I'm assuming this helps a little? In college we used a white noise machine when we didn't want to use a fan. It helped a lot. Although I understand sometimes in gaming you get caught up in the moment and I have done the same thing. When it's affecting someone else's sleep it's pretty inconsiderate. It doesn't sound like he's doing it on purpose but something has to be done. NTA.", "NAH. I get being so involved with what you're doing that you don't realize how loud you're getting. Several members of my family are like that. One minute they're whispering and then a few minutes later your phone is giving you decibel warnings.\nOn the flip side, I too have sleeping issues and it's not cool to be woken up on the regular just because someone else isn't paying attention to common courtesy.\n\nHowever, I note you said it's only an issue when you can't run a fan in the room. I'm assuming the fan provides enough white noise to sufficiently mask his voice? If that's the case, and this really is the only issue you have with him, have you tried a white noise generator? There's several White Noise apps you can get that are free, and many of them even have the ability to set alarms as well. I use one of these and it helps *enormously*.", "YTA to yourself", "NTA, had a roommate/good friend that was terrible about that. Since it\u2019s an owned house and your fianc\u00e9, I say you need to have a remodeling conversation more than a you need to be quieter conversation.

I also stay up late some nights playing with my buddies, and I just hope I\u2019m not driving my fianc\u00e9 insane, but I do try my best to be quiet.
