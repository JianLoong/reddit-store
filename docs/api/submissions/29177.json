They have different moms. Kyle is the every other weekend parent to Lia while he is very involved in Jay's life.\n\nFor Jay's 16th birthday I gave him a phone which I believe was a nice and generous gift.\n\nA few days ago was Lia's birthday. My other son Caleb adores Lia. He prety much has a father daughter relationship with her since Kyle is pretty much a deadbeat to her. Caleb informed me that he is planning to buy a second hand car for her birthday and asked if I can contribute to the car as her birthday gift. I gave him 4k to help him buy the car and Lia was overjoyed when she saw it.\n\nNow Kyle thinks I was an asshole for giving a more expensive gift to Lia while I think my gift to Jay was very generous and I didn't do anything wrong\n\nEdit: I know this is too soon for an update but I've already drcided what to do so I wanted to let you know.\n\nI sent the post to Caleb and a few minutes later his wife sent me the 4k that I gave him. They told me to buy a phone for Lia so that I'm not treating them any differently.\n\nSo basically Lia will be getting a phone from me and a car from Caleb and his wife. I know this is not fair to Jay but I can't control how they spend their money so it is what it is and I guess Lia will be much happier with this outcome", "created_utc": 1697649685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17aw4s5/aita_for_giving_my_granddaughter_a_car_while_not/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, reflect. So, Kyle playing favorites = deadbeat. You playing favorites = totally okay. \n\nI get what you are trying to do, and boy, do I feel terribly for Lia. What a b\\*tch Kyle's wife must be to refuse a child a relationships with their father (but was willing to forgive her husband for cheating???), and shame on Kyle for being an all around piece of trash. It's lovely that Caleb has stepped up. \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't care what Kyle thinks about all this, he lost his right to an opinion on how you treat Lia. I care what JAY thinks. Was Jay upset? Was Jay bent out of shape? Does Jay already have a car? Yes, a phone is nice, but it's not $4k- so yes, you played favorites and it's JAY'S feelings you need to be concerned with. You need to chat with Jay and let him know that you didn't help buy the car to hurt his feelings, and you wanted to make sure he knows you love them both equally. Jay either already knows the short end of the stick that Lia already gets and will be somewhat understanding, or Jay will be really bent out of shape for the favoritism and he'd be completely in his rights to feel angry with you.", "So while nice phones are expensive, they are not $4000 expensive so it is justified that there are some hurt feelings on the lack of balance between the gifts. \n\nHowever, I feel like there are elements of this story that are missing. At first you mentioned that Kyle only sees Lia every other weekend which could just be the result of a bad custody battle between him and his ex. Then later on you mention that Kyle's basically a deadbeat to her which is a big jump. It's not my place to pry into their relationships but without more information on the situation, it could be justified as she may be in a bad situation and needs the extra help. \n\nEither way, I will give you like 1/5 AH score if she needed the extra help as it's justified but still understandable why other parties could feel hurt. If there are no extra circumstances and you just spent 3x-4x more on Lia's gift, then YTA.", "YTA for not treating them equally. Of course Jay feels ripped off. He got a phone which is a very nice gift but his sister got an entire car. How in the world do you not see how you've slighted Jay in favor of Lia? She's clearly your favorite too, from what you've noted here and Jay knows it.", "Meh, after reading a view comments, I'm going with ESH except the kids. All you're doing is pinning them against each other even more. Wife should have just left him instead of playing games. And son should not have cheated on his wife. Did affair partner know?", "YTA YTA YTA \n\nI had typed a large reply then I looked to check something and I saw \u201cmy Caleb is the perfect son\u201d wow just wow\n\nSo this is nothing about the way Kyle treats his kids it\u2019s that Caleb supports Lia and you support Caleb.", "I N F O \n\nWhy is Kyle so absent in his daughter's life, but so present in his son's life?\n\nDoes he still have a relationship with his son's mother?\n\nI have so many questions\n\nNTA \n\nYour son is a massive asshole.  \n\nYou are making up for your son cheating on his wife (a deliberate decision, I don't care what anyone else says) and his wife is using the child that resulted from that affair as a way to punish him.\n\nThey both can suck eggs.\n\nYou keep taking care off Lia, and cudos to Caleb for being a fantastic uncle, who sees the favoritism and said \"eff that, let me see how I can fix it\"\n\nEta, I absolutely am not saying that the wife is blame-less here;  by any means \n\nUntil we have the information on why/how she is keeping Kyle from having a relationship from his daughter I am going under the assumption that he is choosing to to keep peace in his marriage and that it is HIS choice, not a forced matter, because if it was force, I would assume that op would have mentioned that in their comment to me, since that is relevant information.  \n\nEta\n\nOP said that the wife forced \"little contact\" which is not great.  \n\nI'm also going under the assumption that ops son took it further in an attempt to keep the peace, as peaceful as possible", "Unless the phone cost 4k then yea YTA!!!", "YTA.  Regardless of what was purchased (car, etc.), you gave $4k as a gift, and a just a phone to Jay.  Keep the gifts consistent across your grandkids.", "Yta for sure. 4k? Jesus", "INFO: why does Caleb have anything to do with Kyle daughter, especially so much so that he's buying her a car, I get the sense there is more to the story?", "YTA.\n\nYou gave one sibling a life changing gift (for a young person), and you gave the other a phone. The back story and your specific reasons for doing so don't change the fact that these gifts were on wildly different scales.\n\nIf you had any kind of emotional insight, you would see how this would lead to conflict.\n\nI know that y'all are trying to make up for one child's fucked up circumstances by making a grand gesture, but by doing so you are creating a schism between these siblings.\n\nYou are also inventing a schism between yourself and your other grandchild.\n\nMeaningful human connections can't be purchased through grand gestures. Big gifts aren't a salve for a broken childhood.\n\nThere were better ways to address this situation. \n\nYou could have bought both kids a car and then focused on expressing your love and emotional support to your long-suffering granddaughter. You could have made efforts to unite the family and to inspire feelings of connection between all of the parties involved.\n\nInstead, you made things worse.", "YTA. Sure, a phone is an amazing gift. But compared to a car ?! \n\nYou clearly showed which one was your favorite.", "BIG YTA, 4k is definitly way more than what a phone costs, that's playing favorites. Even if Lia deserves the car given Kyle favoritism, you and Kaleb are doing the same thing by favoring Lia over Jay, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree i guess...", "YTA, it\u2019s unlikely that that phone was worth $4000", "YTA, you shouldn\u2019t make one grandchild feel less then because of the parents, it\u2019s not your grandsons fault", "YTA. Unless that phone cost $4K, you spent far more on Lia than you did on Jay. That's blatantly unfair.", "Obvious YTA. \"Am I the AH for showing obvious favoritism?\"", "Hm. \n\nYTA because favortism can poison the relationship.  And I would say it is favortism since 4k is a lot of money, while a phone in comparison is much cheaper.\n\nHowever, kyle is not entitled to get a car now. But for me, it is logical that he complains.", "YTA for the disparity in value, but Kyle is an even bigger AH. If Jay had been the one who had a problem with the gift that would have been one thing, but Kyle is the one giving you a hard time. Why isn't Kyle buying these gifts for his own kids? Why is his brother buying his daughter a car? It sounds like Jay is Kyle's obvious favorite. I wonder if Kyle would be equally upset if the gifts were reversed. Let Kyle buy his golden child a car.", "YTA you're showing your grandson Jay who your favorite is and he won't forget it. You were trying to be generous and make up for the fact that your son Kyle doesn't treat his daughter the same as his son, but instead you're creating a divide between you and Jay, and possibly a divide between Jay and Lia, as Jay might be angry at Lia for getting a much larger gift.", "NTA. Kyle created the different dynamic through his own behavior and you and Caleb are having to pick up the slack on his bad parenting. He doesn't get to call you an AH for treating his two kids differently when he does the same thing in the opposite direction.", "If your son is truly involved in Jay\u2019s life while being a deadbeat dad to Lia, NTA. As long as Kyle openly favors one of his children over the other, you shouldn\u2019t waste another second worrying about him being upset the one time Lia got more from his side of the family than Jay.", "NTA.  The gift for Lia was a combined gift from more than you.  It's no one's business how much money you spend on whom.  Hopefully, Jay isn't being taught that love is measured by money.  Just be careful that you don't find yourself over compensating for Kyle's lack of attention to Lia by creating too much of a disparity in how you treat both grandkids.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money, and you already donated towards getting her a car", "NTA. You are entitled to spend your money whatever way you like. He does get to complain and say it is not fair though. It\u2019s not fair but it is life and they may as well get used to it now.", "NTA - Kyle treats one kid better than the other, why can't you do the same in reverse?  He should pony up and get Jay a car.", "Nta it\u2019s a gift from your other son who is taking on a role of a father when the real one won\u2019t do anything. I would be proud of my son for being so kind and willing to step in for someone who isn\u2019t their own child. You are not in the wrong!

It\u2019s not the Grandson\u2018s fault his dad is a jerk. So she\u2019s doing the same thing the dad is doing. She\u2019s insulting the Grandson because of the dad.
