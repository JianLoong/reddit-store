But, reflect. So, Kyle playing favorites = deadbeat. You playing favorites = totally okay. \n\nI get what you are trying to do, and boy, do I feel terribly for Lia. What a b\\*tch Kyle's wife must be to refuse a child a relationships with their father (but was willing to forgive her husband for cheating???), and shame on Kyle for being an all around piece of trash. It's lovely that Caleb has stepped up. \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't care what Kyle thinks about all this, he lost his right to an opinion on how you treat Lia. I care what JAY thinks. Was Jay upset? Was Jay bent out of shape? Does Jay already have a car? Yes, a phone is nice, but it's not $4k- so yes, you played favorites and it's JAY'S feelings you need to be concerned with. You need to chat with Jay and let him know that you didn't help buy the car to hurt his feelings, and you wanted to make sure he knows you love them both equally. Jay either already knows the short end of the stick that Lia already gets and will be somewhat understanding, or Jay will be really bent out of shape for the favoritism and he'd be completely in his rights to feel angry with you.", "So while nice phones are expensive, they are not $4000 expensive so it is justified that there are some hurt feelings on the lack of balance between the gifts. \n\nHowever, I feel like there are elements of this story that are missing. At first you mentioned that Kyle only sees Lia every other weekend which could just be the result of a bad custody battle between him and his ex. Then later on you mention that Kyle's basically a deadbeat to her which is a big jump. It's not my place to pry into their relationships but without more information on the situation, it could be justified as she may be in a bad situation and needs the extra help. \n\nEither way, I will give you like 1/5 AH score if she needed the extra help as it's justified but still understandable why other parties could feel hurt. If there are no extra circumstances and you just spent 3x-4x more on Lia's gift, then YTA.", "YTA for not treating them equally. Of course Jay feels ripped off.

Unless that phone cost $4K, you spent far more on Lia than you did on Jay. That's blatantly unfair.", "Obvious YTA. \"Am I the AH for showing obvious favoritism?\"", "Hm. \n\nYTA because favortism can poison the relationship.  And I would say it is favortism since 4k is a lot of money, while a phone in comparison is much cheaper.\n\nHowever, kyle is not entitled to get a car now. But for me, it is logical that he complains.", "YTA for the disparity in value, but Kyle is an even bigger AH. If Jay had been the one who had a problem with the gift that would have been one thing, but Kyle is the one giving you a hard time. Why isn't Kyle buying these gifts for his own kids? Why is his brother buying his daughter a car? It sounds like Jay is Kyle's obvious favorite. I wonder if Kyle would be equally upset if the gifts were reversed. Let Kyle buy his golden child a car.", "YTA you're showing your grandson Jay who your favorite is and he won't forget it. You were trying to be generous and make up for the fact that your son Kyle doesn't treat his daughter the same as his son, but instead you're creating a divide between you and Jay, and possibly a divide between Jay and Lia, as Jay might be angry at Lia for getting a much larger gift.", "NTA. Kyle created the different dynamic through his own behavior and you and Caleb are having to pick up the slack on his bad parenting.
