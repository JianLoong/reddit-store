My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689084048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ws8s2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_use_my_college_fund_to/", "score": 851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The money isn't yours, firstly. It was allocated by your mother for a specific thing.\n\nYou're damn right you're not getting the money back if you loan them. It was grossly inappropriate for our father to ask for money from you, who I presume is a minor.", "NTA. You have a lovely, understanding and clear eyed view of this. He'd never pay you back and you'd be stuck under college debt for the next 20 years.\n\n\nAsk your mom to be the bad guy. She can have her divorce attorney send a letter telling  him the funds are hers to control and she's not giving up years of her savings for he and his affair partner's expenses. She can also tell him that she'll take him to court to end his custody if he keeps trying to financially abuse a 17 year old. That's a bit of a feint since you could choose to go no contact at any point but it might shock him out of his behavior.", "NTA \n\nThat money is your Mom's money that was set aside from her for your college. It was not meant to pay for her ex husband's kid's treatments. \n\nThey call it a loan, but it is not. It will never be repaid and your MOM will be out thousands of dollars of her hard earned money. \n\nThey need to come up with other sources, such as holding fundraisers (carwashes, yardsales, HoFundme, and BBQ do well in my area) or StepMom needs to work after Dad is off work so he can do childcare, or Dad needs a second job. They can also look into government aid or medical studies where treatment would be covered.", "NTA, that money was put away to secure your future.  Your brothers health issues are sad but you are not responsible for him. That's his father's job and it's not fair of them to have asked this of you.", "NTA, he made his bed.  That is money that was specifically saved for your future, mainly by your mom.  It is not you mother\u2019s responsibility to pay for your father\u2019s affair babies.

I can\u2019t imagine the bills they have, and you are right you will never get the money back.", "Your father started off the deal by lying to your face. That money would not ever be paid back. He wants to destroy your future to give it to his other child, but your future was painstakingly secured by your mother and is not his to take.

First, ALL dialysis in the United States is paid for by Medicaid - even if someone is wealthy.\n\nA treatment not covered AT ALL by insurance? that sounds kind of suspect. I would want to speak to the physicians directly. If you are an adult enough to be expected to fund the treatment you are adult enough to get the facts directly.\n\nI'm sorry for your sibling but this is NOT your problem. This is a problem of your parents making. Maybe this kids mom ought to go get a job.", "NTA. Tell them frankly that it's not your money and your mom has the right to use that money as she sees fit.

News Flash, us adults can be ginormous turds when we are scared or feel our backs against the wall, but this is WAY beyond that.  Your father is putting up Hall Of Fame AH numbers right now.  He is the proverbial drowning person who will drag you down with them is you let them.\n\nYour reasoning is clear, and it is correct in my view.\n\nDo not forget your current understanding, that this money has nothing to do with how much you love or care for your brother.  Your Dad should be ashamed of himself.\n\nI hope your father snaps out of this and recognizes his toxic approach could do permanent damage to your relationship.\n\nFor additional perspective, when I was 3 or 4, my slightly older sister lost both kidneys, then she spent 50 years fighting battle after battle.  So consider, that your college fund is but a drop of water compared to the river of medical costs that may be coming for your father and his wife over the coming decades.  It will mean very little in the battle to pay all those medical bills but will mean the world to your education.", "NTA.   He should  ask his siblings or parents  or money. ,,or his wife's family. \n\nYou spend that money for college  !!!!", "NTA. I want to say N-A-H but this isn't a fair ask.

Your dad's wife can start working , they can sell the house and move somewhere smaller like the way your mom had to move out.  They will figure something out.  It's a tough situation but your mom contributed to that money so your dad has no feet to stand on. I would go low contact till they stop being mad at you.", "NTA. Sorry this is happening, but you're right. It's your mom's money not his. If you gave it to him, knowing that your mom wouldn't, it would be like stealing from her and from yourself, but mainly her.", "NTA, you know they won't pay you back, as you said, it is not your money to give away but use for college.

Please tell your mother what you dad and step mom are doing.", "NTA...first that money belongs to your mom.  She would have to decide to let them have it.  I highly doubt she would let them.  So the decision is not up to you.  Second, you are not responsible for their financial difficulties.  Your mother already helped him by stopping child support.  \n\nHonestly if they are having that many issues, they can legally divorce and his wife can get public assistance/free health care if they are in the US.

It's your college fund, but as you say, it's owned by your mom. If your dad wants to raid the fund, he needs to talk to your mom about it - it's just not your decision to make.\n\nI'm sure you'd like to find a way to help your brother, but it's really your dad's responsibility to deal with this.\n\nNTA, but your dad and stepmom are for trying to guilt you into taking over this problem for them.", "NTA- \nLook I am going to be completely honest (which might get me downvoted) but the fault is your fathers and his wife\u2019s. They should have set funds aside for unfortunate situations like this. His wife could get a job to fund her kid\u2019s medical issue. They should have thought long and hard before having a kid. I do understand sometimes the funds you set aside might not be enough but that is something they need to figure out themselves rather than asking their other kid for their college money. You yourself said that you know won\u2019t be able to rely on your father when it comes to college funds. They are asking you to jeopardize your future for your brother. Plus as you said it\u2019s your mom\u2019s money so it\u2019s ultimately up to her to decide what she does with that money. \n\nI definitely do understand why you would feel guilty and bad for your brother but that should not be your burden to carry. It\u2019s your father\u2019s and his wife. I am sorry you are put in an unfortunate situation.", "NTA, sounds like you Dad hasn't put much into the fund but seems like he feels entitled  to the money your mum put into it. \n\nHe sacrificed your family for his affair. He sacrificed contributing to you future by agreeing to his wife being a SAHM. Now he wants you to sacrifice your future and your mums money.\n\nThere will always be a reason why he can't repay the money and whilst i feel sorry for your half brother. You are not the parent he and your step mom are \n\nMaybe find out how much he actually contributed to you fund and offer to lend him that but with proper  payment terms so that you are not left in unneeded debt at the end.", "NTA.

Your dad and his wife need to put the time in for a fundraiser, or his wife needs to get a job to start covering some of this.", "NTA - just so messed up and sad that this is even a choice you/anyone would ever have to make in one of the richest countries in the world.  smh", "Yeah real asshole is a predatory healthcare system that causes people to incur medical debt but... NTA - that money is for you and your future. Frankly, your dad never should have ever asked you.\n\nFrankly, your stepmom should've got a job awhile ago to help pay for things. Granted it's possible she needs to be available for medical reasons, but they clearly can't afford her to not be working. They're asking to borrow the money but they have no way of paying it back. If they can't get a loan due to debt that says a lot. If they need money they should be talking to other adults, not a kid.", "Even IF you gave that money you don't know how much treatment this kid would need and the cost.

Your focus is college and keep your plan in check to make sure you have the best chance in life\n\nSomeones gotta be in your corner and I'll easily say it cause clearly your dad doesn't give two shits about you. \n\nYour mum worked hard to give you a chance at a good start after school.

They shouldn\u2019t be guilt tripping you, especially since they barely contributed.", "Okay this is tough because most people on this thread will say \"NTA it is your money don't give it away\". And technically they are right.\n\nThe question is this - taking your bio dad and stepmother out of the equation, how will YOU feel if your brother passes away due to your father's inability to pay out of pocket for him? This is not meant to guilt you in any way, and like most of reddit I am still telling you to look out for yourself. But I would argue that losing your future to financial debt may be similar to longstanding feelings of guilt. It really depends on what kind of relationship you have with your little brother and your dad / stepmother, and on whether they've seemingly exhausted any and all other options (i.e. GoFundMe, SAHM getting a job now that 10-year-old twin is in school, Dad working second job, etc...). \n\nYou are correct it is not your money, it belongs chiefly to your parents. IF you are the kind of person who may feel guilty (and I'm not saying you have to, none of this is on you) you can consider offering back all of Dad's contributions. You could talk to your mother about whether she could consider the college fund a \"loan\" and whether she is in a financial position to help. Obviously she won't want anything to do with the cheating ex and the affair children, but IF (and only if) those kids are important to YOU, your mother may consider helping for YOUR sake, not for his / theirs. \n\nThere is no easy answer here, but please don't blindly listen to the many, many NTAs who tell you \"you're fine don't feel guilty\". I'm not saying you SHOULD feel guilty, I'm telling you how I and many other people would feel if we were on the other end of the situation and the kid passed away because the family was unable to afford treatments. Please consider not only your financial future but emotional future, and see if you can think about how you will feel 5 and 10 years down the road. If you think you will not feel guilty, and you shouldn't (it's not your responsibility to care financially for your family, it was their job to care for yours) then go to your dream college with your full fund. If you think that no matter what logic tells you you will still feel guilty (I am the type of person, for better or worse, who would) then consider what middle grounds may be open to you to ease the guilt without self-sabotaging your future. \n\nGood luck OP, NTA regardless of what you decide.", "The real AH is a medical system that makes choosing between college and healthcare necessary.

My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Unless she has a solid career waiting, a lot of people are SAH because it is more affordable than working and paying for childcare for four children, particularly when one requires intensive care.\n\nLoans - addressed in OP, they can't\n\nFundraising - kinda what he is doing, but what are the odds a gofundme actually reaches its goal?

If OP\u2019s half brother dies, it will not be because of his father\u2019s decisions or OP\u2019s decisions or karma or anything else. It will be because the system has failed all of them by requiring his parents to take on impossible expenses and debt to save his life. And because sometimes the world sucks and innocent kids die, even if you do come up with the money. This is just not something that can ever be blamed on an individual.", "So his future should be fucked because of his fathers decisions? Why doesnt the step mom look for a job or financial help or something.. the easiest thing is to guilt OP into giving away (because we all know they would never pay him back) the college fund his mom worked hard to build.", "Honestly, if the kid is too sick for transplant the prognosis is not good. People can live a long time (decades) on dialysis. \n\nOP -- NTA. But if you do feel yourself bowing to the pressure, tell them you want to talk to the doctors. Get a real idea of what the prognosis is -- the treatment may not be able to help or it may be some sort of stop-gap. In other words, it may end up costing you your future while actually not helping him. \n\nAnd I really don't know of any treatment besides dialysis that can stop kidney disease and I'm fairly knowledgeable about this stuff since my husband has done dialysis and had a kidney transplant.", "No, and that's entirely on the father if he does die and it's entirely the father's responsibility to keep him from dying.", "It's extremely unlikely that this shady \"treatment\" that the insurance won't pay a dime for is going to save OP's brother's life.", "I'm not saying that's what I would or would not do. I'm just laying out the facts. And someone somewhere else pointed out in the comments that if the money is in a 529, there's a substantial tax penalty pulling that cash out for non-educational purposes. It's sad but I'm not putting up a judgment. That is way beyond my pay grade.", "Apparently all of you in the US are ok with that or else you would have a walfare state.", "I know that. It\u2019s hard but at the end of the day it\u2019s money his mom worked for.", "They haven't exhausted all other opportunities though. The dad's new wife is still a SAHM. If things are truly that desperate then she needs to get a job to try and save her kid.  NOT mooch off her step kids college fund.  If the half brother needs constant care then she needs to find a job on a different shift than the husband so that they can rotate care and be a double income household. Would it suck? Yeah but it's totally doable and she should have done it immediately even just part time.\n\nAlso, this sounds like a Hail Mary treatment. Sorry but I don't give the brother good odds with OR without treatment. \ud83d\ude15", "Yes, it does.", "OP is not the one that brought this child I to the world.

The choice is OP\u2019s and I think telling someone their sibling may die unless they fork over their college fund is fucking awful. There\u2019s Go Fund Me and bunch of stuff dad can do to get help. That\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility. It\u2019s his father\u2019s responsibility to take care of his children, not drain college funds for the other child. OP is in no way an asshole for not giving up their education and future on a treatment they don\u2019t even know will work since the others aren\u2019t and the kid will need a transplant down the line anyway. It one thing to ask for help with the bills, it\u2019s another to expect their sibling to fork over their entire college fund for a treatment that isn\u2019t even guaranteed to work and I personally think calling an 18yr old kid an asshole for that is awful.", "Well no - OP has 2 families, not one.

OP is still entitled to the child support but his mother would be covering for the lack of income from the father.", "This is not true for every state. In my state child support ends when the child is 18 or graduates high school\u2026whichever comes first. \n\nNTA OP - It is monumentally selfish of your father to ask you to give up your future for his other kids that he had with his affair partner. You and your mom have already done enough by ending child support. Tell him to kick rocks.", "Not in TX. The minute my daughter turned 18 (and was headed for college) he petitioned for emancipation and got it. So..... not a penny since.\n\nWhen my daughter was 10, he refused to let us switch coverage and benefits to us because it was easier (both military). She is eligible for COBRA until 26 years old. He dropped her the day she turned 23...even when she asked for an extension. \n\nWe now cannot add her to ours. We are now frantically looking for medical co erage for her.", "This is false. State by state and I have canceled child support before. All she would even have to say in some states is just to stop. Or oh we're back together. Stop spreading false info", "this may vary by state though, bc where I live child support only goes until the child is 18 regardless if they continue their education or not. It didn't use to be that way as I remember my dad still had to pay for my brother and I when we continued school, but for my daughter last year as soon as she turned 18 her case was closed since she was considered an adult.\n\nETA: I'm in PA and the law is as soon as they turn 18 or finish high school, whichever happens last, which my kiddo graduated 2 weeks after her birthday so it didn't make much difference.", "Who pays the electricity, gas, food clothes rent & clothes etc the mum or whoever has custody of the child. Child support goes to the mum/father/guardian to help raise a child so they can have the afore mentioned. It does not go to the child but towards the raising of the child.", "This must vary by state, because in Pennsylvania none of that is true. Child support is to be used to support the care of the child, which could be anything from clothes to food to utilities, there's nothing designating how or what that money is used for specifically. The payment is almost always made to an account in the primary parent's name, the child doesn't have access unless the primary parent provides it. Child support can be suspended by the primary parent, even if the support is court ordered. Support is only required to be paid if the child receives state benefits like chip, if it's suspended by the primary parent then the child loses their benefits. Child support also ends at 18 or until they graduate high school, whichever happens last. Source: Step parent to a kid who's deadbeat bioparent has tried everything in the book to get out of support, had to know about the laws to fight back.\n\nObviously this poor teen is nta at all.", "Child support varies state to state. In NJ, the custodial parent can absolutely have the case closed prior to a minor reaching legal age. The only time the state makes it mandatory is in the case of a minor receiving public benefits. Again, I can only speak to NJ.", "Yeah just keep putting this on your mom. This is not something you should be dealing with. Tell him it\u2019s not your money and your mom has said no.

The point is that it\u2019s not OPs responsibility and never should have been.", "Do you know for sure the treatment will work?", "Experimental treatment is the Hail Mary of medicine.

If I was OP I would block dad and his wife on all forms of communication and go NC.", "It hasn't been demonstrated that the \"treatment\" would save the kid's life.  It almost certainly won't.

People whose organs have failed can't always be saved - especially if their too sick for a transplant.", "Holy fucking shit no it doesn\u2019t. What is wrong with you? Kids NTA because it\u2019s not their decision and asking them was inappropriate, but their brother living or dying is more important than a college fund, get some fucking perspective.", "Thats a dumb argument. I would hope that OP didnt give birth to his brother. That doesn't make him not still sick. And now we are assuming this person is lying? To gain what? Are you saying the child is not sick? Are you saying this is all a ruse to get at the money? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I am saying is I have a half brother and I love him. I dont see my brother as a half sibling hes my brother. I wouldnt want to see my brother regardless of who his mother is wither away and die. My friend is currently in dialysis and hes gone from a healthy 240 to around 120 pounds.  Hes dying in front of us. If I could help him I would. Its brutal to see someone turning yellow from jaundice in front of you. The OP never clarified if this brother of his is close to them at all. If this is a person he never seen doesnt have a relationship with I can understand not wanting to help out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if it was my family I would because I can put my needs aside to help others. I dont think OP should have this weight on there shoulders at all it must be tough but to me its less about money and more that I could help.", "I am just not a black and white person like most of you on here. I am also in school for healthcare so maybe I am a bit of a bleeding heart and one of my friends is dying of some kidney problem that hasnt been properly diagnosed so they cant move forward with any real treatment so he is dying in front of us. Its hard to see a person you love dying because they arent getting proper treatment. \n\nI agree gofund me and stuff is an option and absolutely the father should find other ways of getting money but I am just trying to put myself in the shoes of everyone. When death is an option I would take that seriously. I would help out but I wouldnt give the whole thing but I would help as much as I could.", "Thats the dumbest shit ive read here. Its still his brother they share similar DNA. IT shouldn't ever existed in the first place well that's an argument we could probably make about a lot of people. Regardless of that fact he is here and he is OPs family. Should we blame this child for the fathers mistakes? What stuff has your parents done that you're not proud of? Should we blame you for that? Seems pretty dumb. And I have half siblings I dont say I have 2 families because I am not an insensitive prick. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I said earlier I am not defending this persons father. I am more on the side of helping a sibling.", "I assume OP is the 5th child with split custody.", "Not intentionally false information. I only meant to distinguish from other countries, not individual States. I should have been more clear, apologize.", "Yes, I know. It's just so sad his country doesn't have free Healthcare.", "You're assuming this supposed treatment would actually make any difference.", "And you are speaking more from your own experience as in not seeing anything wrong with dad being a lazy and prideful a hole not to expand his own search for medical funding. Again you can love family and I am sure he has no hard feelings towards the kid. However op is not responsible for sacrificing his future. You are definitely someone who does not take in the long view. Dad can get assistance now all he has to do is some leg work. Op may not qualify for college at all in the future and with the rate of inflation by then he probably won't be able to afford it.", "This ain\u2019t about you", "I think by \"family of four\" they mean dad, step-mom and twins", "I think this is right, but 5th family member, including the 2 parents.
