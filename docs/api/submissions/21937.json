{"id": 21937, "submission_id": "14ws8s2", "title": "AITA for not wanting to use my college fund to pay for my brother's treatment?", "selftext": "My parents divorced when I was about 7 because my dad had admitted to having an affair. My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA \nMy dad does have a second job that he works on the weekend, and his wife home schools the boys and is a full time care giver for my brother.\n\nMy dad's family disowned him when the affair came to light. He did get some help from his brother and sister but they can only give so much, I do think I was his last option. His wife did not have a lot of family.\n\nLastly, of course I would feel bad if something happened to my brother, he's just a little kid, but I would want to help him with MY OWN money and I can only do that if I start my career debt free. I Also don't want to risk my own future. \n\nUPDATE\n\nSo after I called my mom she left work early and picked me up from dad's house. She took me for coffee and I explained what happened. \n\nAfter talking a bit she said I could either keep the fund as is and not give dad the money or we can take the money that dad had contributed and give that back to him. I told her I wanted to give dad back the money he put in. \n\nAfter we finish our coffee mom withdrew the exact amount dad put in over the years. Mom also matched the amount and added it to give to dad. \n\nI waited in the car while she gave dad the money and he was upset because the money wasn't enough. Mom told him that is all he's going to get from her and threatened to take him to court if he and his wife keeps harassing me. \n\nThis is probably the last update as I am going low contact with dad for now. Thank you everyone of the genuine support and the advice.", "created_utc": 1689084048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ws8s2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_use_my_college_fund_to/", "score": 11346, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The money isn't yours, firstly. It was allocated by your mother for a specific thing.\n\nYou're damn right you're not getting the money back if you loan them. It was grossly inappropriate for our father to ask for money from you, who I presume is a minor.", "NTA. You have a lovely, understanding and clear eyed view of this. He'd never pay you back and you'd be stuck under college debt for the next 20 years.\n\n\nAsk your mom to be the bad guy. She can have her divorce attorney send a letter telling  him the funds are hers to control and she's not giving up years of her savings for he and his affair partner's expenses. She can also tell him that she'll take him to court to end his custody if he keeps trying to financially abuse a 17 year old.

It was not meant to pay for her ex husband's kid's treatments. \n\nThey call it a loan, but it is not.

They can also look into government aid or medical studies where treatment would be covered.", "NTA, that money was put away to secure your future.  Your brothers health issues are sad but you are not responsible for him. That's his father's job and it's not fair of them to have asked this of you.", "NTA, he made his bed.  That is money that was specifically saved for your future, mainly by your mom.  It is not you mother\u2019s responsibility to pay for your father\u2019s affair babies.  My family incurrent a lot of medical bills when I was younger and it to decades to recover from the financial struggle, and that was with insurance.  I can\u2019t imagine the bills they have, and you are right you will never get the money back.", "Your father started off the deal by lying to your face. That money would not ever be paid back.

You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't going to pay you back.  Their debts and poor credit are their own fault, not yours.  You need to focus on your education to avoid the hole they dug for themselves.", "Nta\nTell your mom, you shouldn't be put into this situation.

A child's life shouldn't depend on trading another child's education nor should it plunge a family into financial disaster.", "NTA\n\nOP - you need more facts before you make any decision. First, ALL dialysis in the United States is paid for by Medicaid - even if someone is wealthy.\n\nA treatment not covered AT ALL by insurance? that sounds kind of suspect. I would want to speak to the physicians directly. If you are an adult enough to be expected to fund the treatment you are adult enough to get the facts directly.\n\nI'm sorry for your sibling but this is NOT your problem. This is a problem of your parents making. Maybe this kids mom ought to go get a job.", "NTA. Tell them frankly that it's not your money and your mom has the right to use that money as she sees fit.

Your father and stepmother need to figure this out in a way that doesn't harm his other children.", "NTA  -  Wow, first of all, as an adult and imperfect parent myself, I must apologize for your father.  News Flash, us adults can be ginormous turds when we are scared or feel our backs against the wall, but this is WAY beyond that.  Your father is putting up Hall Of Fame AH numbers right now.  He is the proverbial drowning person who will drag you down with them is you let them.\n\nYour reasoning is clear, and it is correct in my view.\n\nDo not forget your current understanding, that this money has nothing to do with how much you love or care for your brother.  Your Dad should be ashamed of himself.\n\nI hope your father snaps out of this and recognizes his toxic approach could do permanent damage to your relationship.\n\nFor additional perspective, when I was 3 or 4, my slightly older sister lost both kidneys, then she spent 50 years fighting battle after battle.  So consider, that your college fund is but a drop of water compared to the river of medical costs that may be coming for your father and his wife over the coming decades.  It will mean very little in the battle to pay all those medical bills but will mean the world to your education.", "NTA.   He should  ask his siblings or parents  or money. ,,or his wife's family. \n\nYou spend that money for college  !!!!", "NTA. I want to say N-A-H but this isn't a fair ask. I get why they did, but it's your mom's money and she's already been more than fair to them. Step-Mom might need to get a job.", "Definitely NTA. Your dad's wife can start working , they can sell the house and move somewhere smaller like the way your mom had to move out.  They will figure something out.  It's a tough situation but your mom contributed to that money so your dad has no feet to stand on. I would go low contact till they stop being mad at you.", "NTA. Sorry this is happening, but you're right. It's your mom's money not his. If you gave it to him, knowing that your mom wouldn't, it would be like stealing from her and from yourself, but mainly her.", "NTA, you know they won't pay you back, as you said, it is not your money to give away but use for college.

Please tell your mother what you dad and step mom are doing.", "NTA...first that money belongs to your mom.  She would have to decide to let them have it.  I highly doubt she would let them.  So the decision is not up to you.  Second, you are not responsible for their financial difficulties.  Your mother already helped him by stopping child support.  \n\nHonestly if they are having that many issues, they can legally divorce and his wife can get public assistance/free health care if they are in the US.  She doesn't work so she should qualify.  I actually know a couple who did this.", "Nta and tell your mom immediately. Is his name still on the account and does he have access?", "NTA.

Do not jeopardise your future because your dad is a plonker.", "Could be wrong, but if it is saved in a 529 plan, doesn't it have to be used for education?", "It's a really shitty thing for your dad to take his parent problems and try to make them your problems. It's your college fund, but as you say, it's owned by your mom. If your dad wants to raid the fund, he needs to talk to your mom about it - it's just not your decision to make.\n\nI'm sure you'd like to find a way to help your brother, but it's really your dad's responsibility to deal with this.\n\nNTA, but your dad and stepmom are for trying to guilt you into taking over this problem for them.", "NTA- \nLook I am going to be completely honest (which might get me downvoted) but the fault is your fathers and his wife\u2019s. They should have set funds aside for unfortunate situations like this. His wife could get a job to fund her kid\u2019s medical issue. They should have thought long and hard before having a kid. I do understand sometimes the funds you set aside might not be enough but that is something they need to figure out themselves rather than asking their other kid for their college money. You yourself said that you know they won\u2019t be able to rely on your father when it comes to college funds. They are asking you to jeopardize your future for your brother. Plus as you said it\u2019s your mom\u2019s money so it\u2019s ultimately up to her to decide what she does with that money. \n\nI definitely do understand why you would feel guilty and bad for your brother but that should not be your burden to carry. It\u2019s your father\u2019s and his wife. I am sorry you are put in an unfortunate situation.", "NTA, sounds like you Dad hasn't put much into the fund but seems like he feels entitled  to the money your mum put into it. \n\nHe sacrificed your family for his affair. He sacrificed contributing to you future by agreeing to his wife being a SAHM. Now he wants you to sacrifice your future and your mums money.\n\nThere will always be a reason why he can't repay the money and whilst i feel sorry for your half brother. You are not the parent he and your step mom are \n\nMaybe find out how much he actually contributed to you fund and offer to lend him that but with proper  payment terms so that you are not left in unneeded debt at the end.", "NTA.

Your dad and his wife need to put the time in for a fundraiser, or his wife needs to get a job to start covering some of this.", "NTA - just so messed up and sad that this is even a choice you/anyone would ever have to make in one of the richest countries in the world.  smh", "Yeah real asshole is a predatory healthcare system that causes people to incur medical debt but... NTA - that money is for you and your future. Frankly, your dad never should have ever asked you.\n\nFrankly, your stepmom should've got a job awhile ago to help pay for things. Granted it's possible she needs to be available for medical reasons, but they clearly can't afford her to not be working. They're asking to borrow the money but they have no way of paying it back. If they can't get a loan due to debt that says a lot. If they need money they should be talking to other adults, not a kid.", "Even IF you gave that money you don't know how much treatment this kid would need and the cost.

This is not meant to guilt you in any way, and like most of reddit I am still telling you to look out for yourself. But I would argue that losing your future to financial debt may be similar to longstanding feelings of guilt. It really depends on what kind of relationship you have with your little brother and your dad / stepmother, and on whether they've seemingly exhausted any and all other options (i.e. GoFundMe, SAHM getting a job now that 10-year-old twin is in school, Dad working second job, etc...). \n\nYou are correct it is not your money, it belongs chiefly to your parents. IF you are the kind of person who may feel guilty (and I'm not saying you have to, none of this is on you) you can consider offering back all of Dad's contributions. You could talk to your mother about whether she could consider the college fund a \"loan\" and whether she is in a financial position to help. Obviously she won't want anything to do with the cheating ex and the affair children, but IF (and only if) those kids are important to YOU, your mother may consider helping for YOUR sake, not for his / theirs. \n\nThere is no easy answer here, but please don't blindly listen to the many, many NTAs who tell you \"you're fine don't feel guilty\". I'm not saying you SHOULD feel guilty, I'm telling you how I and many other people would feel if we were on the other end of the situation and the kid passed away because the family was unable to afford treatments. Please consider not only your financial future but emotional future, and see if you can think about how you will feel 5 and 10 years down the road. If you think you will not feel guilty, and you shouldn't (it's not your responsibility to care financially for your family, it was their job to care for yours) then go to your dream college with your full fund. If you think that no matter what logic tells you you will still feel guilty (I am the type of person, for better or worse, who would) then consider what middle grounds may be open to you to ease the guilt without self-sabotaging your future. \n\nGood luck OP, NTA regardless of what you decide.", "The real AH is a medical system that makes choosing between college and healthcare necessary.

My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I were you, that would be extremely central to my decision making. If he is 100% my brother, that is very different than him being the child of my father's most evil and depraved mistake. Not that he does not deserve treatment, but that *the responsibility for that treatment should not rest on your shoulders*. Just as it is with any other horribly suffering person in the world who is not your responsibility, but especially since *it is your adulterous dad's fault that he is in this situation, not yours*.\n\nBut let's move forward on the assumption your brother comes from your dad and your mom and is 100% blood related.\n\nSo as far as you understand it, you can't have both your brother getting treatment *and* you going to the college you want\n\n>without going into debt myself\n\nSo let's break this down. In order to get your brother treatment, you have to either go to a college you *don't* want, or go into debt. You have to decide if either of these are worth it to potentially fix your brother's condition. You also should know if the treatment your brother is getting even has a substantial chance of working, because if it's just a shot in the dark with extremely low chances of success, it may not be worth crippling your future.\n\n>the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money.\n\nRight, because your mom is the good one in this situation and cares about your future. So this makes it sound like the brother does indeed come from the other woman, and I am 100% in agreement with your mom that this is the right move. You are a child. You should not be responsible for the children of other people, especially when they came into existence through the destruction of your previous nuclear family. That just isn't right to put that kind of expectation on you.\n\nFinally, I am so sorry you have had to deal with this situation. I am sure your dad has his moments where he seems like a good guy (men who have affairs are usually *very* charming people), but just based on the facts here, he is a man of awfully low character. You don't deserve to have been treated how you have, the boy who's sick -- if he's your relation or not -- does not deserve to be in that situation, and really no one but your dad and his \"new wife\" deserve the situation they are in, because they actually did something horribly evil to you, your mom, and any other siblings involved.\n\n>My dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother.\n\nOP, these people are awful.

This situation is a lot more complex than money. Lets look at these aspects at high level\n\nOutside Reality:\n\n* Your mum put the majority of that money together, it isn't 100% \"your\" money. So while you can give her your input, she is going to be the one making the final decision.\n* It is for your college, it's not just some random fun-money savings.\n* You would face financial difficulty in respect to college if it is spent on other things.\n* Your future would likely change significantly if you cannot complete the college education you want.\n* Your dad & his wife are unlikely to be able to pay it back, no matter how good their intentions are.\n\nInside Reality:\n\n* You love your little brother, and if he dies or needs to remain on dialysis for the rest of his life, you would feel responsible.\n\nMedical Reality:\n\n* All of the treatments tried so far have either not worked or stopped working... there is no guarantee this new treatment would do any better.\n\nBased on all of this, the right answer is the one you can accept and live with, with the least amount of regret and damage to your own life. But there's still more to consider before you make that choice.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lessons to learn as we grow up, we cannot always save the people we love, no matter how much we want to. Sometimes we can only save ourselves.\n\nIn this case, SO much of whether this money would help your brother is totally out of your hands and is unknown. It isn't even 100% your choice, really.\n\nFor me, the real focus on what the right choice her is the Medical Reality: medically it doesn't sound like it is anything other than a \"maybe\" - of course his mum & dad want to try it, even if the chance was 1% they would want to. But that doesn't mean it's actually a good choice for him.\n\nI am not a doctor, but I have a close friend who went through YEARS of lung disease (his body basically suddenly decided it was allergic to his lungs!), who had to spend time on Dialysis as well... for around 12 years after this initially started to happen, he tried *everything* you can possibly imagine including going to other countries to do all kinds of experimental treatments, even some really weird ones. Many of these treatments made him sicker than his lung disease. He actually nearly lost an arm after one of the treatments caused his veins to collapse.\n\nIn the end, he agreed to a transplant - he had been resisting it because of his religion - and it was the only thing that worked. Now, he's had about 3 years of recovery, but he is almost 100% back to full normal healthy functionality at this point. It absolutely saved his life.\n\nIt is very likely that at this point, considering all the other things tried, the BEST choice for your little brother is to wait till he can get that transplant. \n\nSo, I would suggest that aside from the money issue, considering the medical side alone, it is likely not the best choice to put your little bro through another treatment that has no guarantee of working when he could be in maintenance and at least having a break from treatments till a transplant is possible.\n\nEven if you had 100% say over this money and gave it to your dad, the treatment is more likely to fail than to succeed (or at least, fail after a short period of time so any gain would be temporary) - so you are very likely to STILL be left feeling sad and bad about your little bro, and now without your planned college future.\n\nAll you can do is tell your mum that your dad asked you this (and if you haven't yet, you should tell her so she is aware of the pressures you are under so that she can support you best whatever happens overall).

But if you do not have the funds to pay the remaining 20%, you will not be denied dialysis. Transplant surgery, on the other hand, requires that you have coverage for 100% of the surgery and aftercare. The hospital may arrange for assistance, but that needs to be covered in advance. \n\nI started out on MediCal (Medicaid) because I could no longer work and had insufficient savings. So they covered what Medicare did not. I now have commercial insurance through my partner's job. They pay the entire cost of my treatment. I have not seen that they get anything from Medicare. The amount request by all my doctors, the dialysis clinic, and hospital (I seem to end up in the hospital at least once per year), is usually aroubd $2 million. The amount they pay, due to negotiated rates, is usually around $800k to $900k.\n\nMediCal gave me the base coverage required.

The thing is, OP doesn't say or probably even know what the specific disease is, and without knowing that, and why the child is ineligible for transplantation at this time, no one here really can say if the child is dying or not. I'd hate to say that to OP if I wasn't absolutely certain of it.\n\nJust from what OP has written I am guessing possibly aHUS or, more probably, one of the C3 glomerulopathies. With the C3Gs there are a few things to try (usually enalapril + MMF + prednisone), and sometimes they work for a while but then they usually stop working well or at all. Eculizumab (Soliris, Alexion Pharmaceuticals) is FDA approved for aHUS but insurers will still fight you on it because it's ungodly expensive, around $750K for one year of infusions. It's off-label for the C3G diseases, although it sometimes works very well (and sometimes it doesn't work at all). However, because it's off label for this family of diseases, neither Medicare not private insurers are obligated to pay for it, and it can be hard to get them to agree. Alexion's patient assistance program for this one is not wonderful.\n\nIf the boy does have aHUS then eculizumab can work well. Again, if it's one of the C3 glomerulopathies, eculizumab sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't, but because disease recurrence is so high with this family of diseases some transplant centers will not transplant without a successful course of eculizumab first, to reduce the likelihood of rapid recurrence. However, eculizumab has been known to beat even the dense deposit form into submission, and patients have been weaned from it without triggering recurrent disease. The C3Gs are a weird family of diseases and success with any of the very limited therapies, all of which are off-label, is highly individual and variable.\n\nAnd no matter how much money is in OP's college fund (*which should absolutely be off limits*), it wouldn't cover more than a few months of this treatment. I've seen eculizumab work near miracles even with advanced disease, but its price tag puts it out of reach for a lot of people. Again, Medicare will typically pay for it for aHUS, *sometimes* for the C3Gs, but it takes a while, and during that while the disease, as you know, progresses. This is all speculation - I'm assuming one of the C3Gs, which I have no reason to assume other than my familiarity with these diseases and the hassle it is to get authorization for this drug.", "I suspect the brother has a glomeronephritis of some kind - maybe IgA nephropathy; it's relatively common in children. There are standard treatments for these, but many patients relapse or do not respond, requiring treatments which I would describe as still reasonable, but less guideline-based. I've been a part of many specialty meetings where we consider a tricky case and which kind of therapy we should use based on available literature evidence, which in some cases is just very small RCTs or case series. These treatments exist and have established indications (e.g. rituximab is designed for treatment of certain haematological malignancies, and is well-established for management of some autoimmune diseases), so it's not like going through a Phase III trial. Given the state of US insurance, I imagine that insurance may not cover this.\n\nSome GNs, such as IgA nephropathy, recur in transplants. There's also a period in-between needing dialysis/transplant and having severe renal failure in which one tries to maintain as much renal function as possible. \n\nUnlikely that he'll be on dialysis for 55 years.

The first thing I thought when OP wrote that insurance won't cover the recommended treatment is that either the child has aHUS, the recommendation is for eculizumab, and he doesn't yet have Medicare coverage (which will cover it for aHUS, but private insurance will fight to NOT cover it due to its cost), OR the child has one of the C3 glomerulopathies, in which case it's hard to get eculizumab covered because it's off-label for those diseases, although it can be effective for some patients. \n\nAs for why he cannot be transplanted now, if he has aHUS and has had one or more transfusions he may be highly sensitized with a high CPRA, in which case finding a suitable kidney will be hard to do no matter where he is on the waiting list. If he has one of the C3Gs his transplant center may require a course of eculizumab to see if he responds prior to transplanting him, because these diseases are NOTORIOUS for recurrence and if he's not a responder to one of the extremely few therapies (and they are ALL off-label) that will SOMETIMES put the disease into remission or slow it down then they may decline to list him, although if he can find a living donor (*which should NOT be OP, who is simply too young to make that decision*) they may go forward with the transplant if Medicare or private insurance will cover it. \n\nOr, he may be so sick that transplantation is a nonstarter at this point because he might not survive the surgery or recovery. In that case, if they're looking for a treatment that will stabilize him, insurance may not pay if he's deemed too sick for it to do any good. An awful situation all around, but this is NOT OP's problem to solve, and his father and stepmother, however desperate they are, should not be trying to guilt OP into giving up their education.
