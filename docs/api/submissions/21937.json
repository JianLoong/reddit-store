My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689084048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ws8s2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_use_my_college_fund_to/", "score": 3784, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The money isn't yours, firstly. It was allocated by your mother for a specific thing.\n\nYou're damn right you're not getting the money back if you loan them. It was grossly inappropriate for our father to ask for money from you, who I presume is a minor.", "NTA. You have a lovely, understanding and clear eyed view of this. He'd never pay you back and you'd be stuck under college debt for the next 20 years.\n\n\nAsk your mom to be the bad guy. She can have her divorce attorney send a letter telling  him the funds are hers to control and she's not giving up years of her savings for he and his affair partner's expenses. She can also tell him that she'll take him to court to end his custody if he keeps trying to financially abuse a 17 year old. That's a bit of a feint since you could choose to go no contact at any point but it might shock him out of his behavior.", "NTA \n\nThat money is your Mom's money that was set aside from her for your college. It was not meant to pay for her ex husband's kid's treatments. \n\nThey call it a loan, but it is not.

They can also look into government aid or medical studies where treatment would be covered.", "NTA, that money was put away to secure your future.  Your brothers health issues are sad but you are not responsible for him. That's his father's job and it's not fair of them to have asked this of you.", "NTA, he made his bed.  That is money that was specifically saved for your future, mainly by your mom.  It is not you mother\u2019s responsibility to pay for your father\u2019s affair babies.

First, ALL dialysis in the United States is paid for by Medicaid - even if someone is wealthy.\n\nA treatment not covered AT ALL by insurance? that sounds kind of suspect. I would want to speak to the physicians directly. If you are an adult enough to be expected to fund the treatment you are adult enough to get the facts directly.\n\nI'm sorry for your sibling but this is NOT your problem. This is a problem of your parents making. Maybe this kids mom ought to go get a job.", "NTA. Tell them frankly that it's not your money and your mom has the right to use that money as she sees fit.

Your father and stepmother need to figure this out in a way that doesn't harm his other children.", "NTA  -  Wow, first of all, as an adult and imperfect parent myself, I must apologize for your father.  News Flash, us adults can be ginormous turds when we are scared or feel our backs against the wall, but this is WAY beyond that.  Your father is putting up Hall Of Fame AH numbers right now.  He is the proverbial drowning person who will drag you down with them is you let them.\n\nYour reasoning is clear, and it is correct in my view.\n\nDo not forget your current understanding, that this money has nothing to do with how much you love or care for your brother.  Your Dad should be ashamed of himself.\n\nI hope your father snaps out of this and recognizes his toxic approach could do permanent damage to your relationship.\n\nFor additional perspective, when I was 3 or 4, my slightly older sister lost both kidneys, then she spent 50 years fighting battle after battle.  So consider, that your college fund is but a drop of water compared to the river of medical costs that may be coming for your father and his wife over the coming decades.  It will mean very little in the battle to pay all those medical bills but will mean the world to your education.", "NTA.

Your dad's wife can start working , they can sell the house and move somewhere smaller like the way your mom had to move out.  They will figure something out.  It's a tough situation but your mom contributed to that money so your dad has no feet to stand on. I would go low contact till they stop being mad at you.", "NTA.

So the decision is not up to you.  Second, you are not responsible for their financial difficulties.  Your mother already helped him by stopping child support.  \n\nHonestly if they are having that many issues, they can legally divorce and his wife can get public assistance/free health care if they are in the US.

If your dad wants to raid the fund, he needs to talk to your mom about it - it's just not your decision to make.\n\nI'm sure you'd like to find a way to help your brother, but it's really your dad's responsibility to deal with this.\n\nNTA, but your dad and stepmom are for trying to guilt you into taking over this problem for them.", "NTA- \nLook I am going to be completely honest (which might get me downvoted) but the fault is your fathers and his wife\u2019s. They should have set funds aside for unfortunate situations like this. His wife could get a job to fund her kid\u2019s medical issue. They should have thought long and hard before having a kid. I do understand sometimes the funds you set aside might not be enough but that is something they need to figure out themselves rather than asking their other kid for their college money. You yourself said that you know they won\u2019t be able to rely on your father when it comes to college funds. They are asking you to jeopardize your future for your brother. Plus as you said it\u2019s your mom\u2019s money so it\u2019s ultimately up to her to decide what she does with that money. \n\nI definitely do understand why you would feel guilty and bad for your brother but that should not be your burden to carry. It\u2019s your father\u2019s and his wife. I am sorry you are put in an unfortunate situation.", "NTA, sounds like you Dad hasn't put much into the fund but seems like he feels entitled  to the money your mum put into it. \n\nHe sacrificed your family for his affair. He sacrificed contributing to you future by agreeing to his wife being a SAHM. Now he wants you to sacrifice your future and your mums money.\n\nThere will always be a reason why he can't repay the money and whilst i feel sorry for your half brother.

Your dad and his wife need to put the time in for a fundraiser, or his wife needs to get a job to start covering some of this.", "NTA - just so messed up and sad that this is even a choice you/anyone would ever have to make in one of the richest countries in the world.  smh", "Yeah real asshole is a predatory healthcare system that causes people to incur medical debt but... NTA - that money is for you and your future. Frankly, your dad never should have ever asked you.\n\nFrankly, your stepmom should've got a job awhile ago to help pay for things. Granted it's possible she needs to be available for medical reasons, but they clearly can't afford her to not be working. They're asking to borrow the money but they have no way of paying it back. If they can't get a loan due to debt that says a lot. If they need money they should be talking to other adults, not a kid.", "Even IF you gave that money you don't know how much treatment this kid would need and the cost.

They shouldn\u2019t be guilt tripping you, especially since they barely contributed.", "Okay this is tough because most people on this thread will say \"NTA it is your money don't give it away\". And technically they are right.\n\nThe question is this - taking your bio dad and stepmother out of the equation, how will YOU feel if your brother passes away due to your father's inability to pay out of pocket for him? This is not meant to guilt you in any way, and like most of reddit I am still telling you to look out for yourself. But I would argue that losing your future to financial debt may be similar to longstanding feelings of guilt. It really depends on what kind of relationship you have with your little brother and your dad / stepmother, and on whether they've seemingly exhausted any and all other options (i.e. GoFundMe, SAHM getting a job now that 10-year-old twin is in school, Dad working second job, etc...). \n\nYou are correct it is not your money, it belongs chiefly to your parents. IF you are the kind of person who may feel guilty (and I'm not saying you have to, none of this is on you) you can consider offering back all of Dad's contributions. You could talk to your mother about whether she could consider the college fund a \"loan\" and whether she is in a financial position to help. Obviously she won't want anything to do with the cheating ex and the affair children, but IF (and only if) those kids are important to YOU, your mother may consider helping for YOUR sake, not for his / theirs. \n\nThere is no easy answer here, but please don't blindly listen to the many, many NTAs who tell you \"you're fine don't feel guilty\". I'm not saying you SHOULD feel guilty, I'm telling you how I and many other people would feel if we were on the other end of the situation and the kid passed away because the family was unable to afford treatments. Please consider not only your financial future but emotional future, and see if you can think about how you will feel 5 and 10 years down the road. If you think you will not feel guilty, and you shouldn't (it's not your responsibility to care financially for your family, it was their job to care for yours) then go to your dream college with your full fund.

My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers. \n\nMy mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund. \n\nMy dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund. \n\nI'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college. \n\nUnfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support. \n\nThe specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt. \n\nDad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to. \n\nI really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it. \n\nIn addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money. \n\nMy dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
