Last week I found out from my mom that he proposed to her and they\u2019re now engaged. \n\nLittle backstory. My sister and I have never had a good relationship, we are not close and don\u2019t talk much. But we are both somewhat close to our mom (her more than me) so I know about most of her major life things that way. My sister has had 6 (maybe more) boyfriends before Finn, and has cheated on every single one. That\u2019s why they all left her. Previously I didn\u2019t really care, I didn\u2019t want to be involved - but I met Finn at a family dinner right when she started seeing him, and we really hit it off. He\u2019s a super sweet and fun person to talk to, and we have similar jobs and hobbies. We\u2019ve been close friends for the last few years.\n\nSo when I found out that my sister was cheating on him (6 months after she started dating him), I called her up and gave it to her straight. I said he\u2019s an amazing guy and way too good for her, and if she got her shit together and stopped cheating, she could maybe actually deserve him, and have a chance. I thought she listened, because they\u2019ve been together for way longer than any of her other boyfriends lasted.\n\nBut I guess Finn is just too trusting and unsuspicious, because my mom told me last week that she\u2019s cheated on Finn with 4 women in the last 2 years. In the same conversation when she said they were engaged. I was shocked and appalled, so I told Finn about this that evening. I said that my sister didn\u2019t deserve him and he should cut and run. He was understandably furious and did break up with her straight away. Now my sister is furious with me, she says it was none of my business to interfere and also because she\u2019s not currently cheating on Finn, I was bringing up \u201cancient history\u201d because I was jealous and want to date him. This is riduculous, I live with my boyfriend of 2 years and honestly, the age gap between me and Finn is way too much. We\u2019re just friends, and have never been anything more while she\u2019s been cheating on him for years. So anyway, am I the asshole for interfering her?

She probably doesn\u2019t deserve any monogamous relationship.", "NTA - I prob would have told him when she did it six months in.\n\nI think ppl can move on from cheating but deserve to make their own decision on that and fix the relationship (/ cheater) if they want to. Otherwise the adage 'once a cheater, always a cheater' will ring true.", "NTA.

For you it is best to not include yourself in their circle as in future it can consume your mental health, for know you are relatively young so you still have chance in life every person you have crush on or are really nice doesn't really mean they think of you the same, as for your sister you shouldn't really talk bad or have any negative movements with her or your mother as it can affect your mother. also just stop caring about things that doesn't affect you.(I am just a random guy who just thought to give my thoughts and my words ARE NOT MENT TO BE A ADVICE it is just a thought you can consider)", "YTA. You sound like you have a thing for Finn and are jealous of your sister. This will also damage your sisters relationship with your mom which maybe is what you wanted?", "YTA - You told him she was cheating on him based on what that your Mom told you?  You had no first hand information and based it completely off history.  And you hit it off with him, your words, straight away.  You sister may be on to something about your motives.  Butt out in the future in your sister's relationships.", "Esh. She is your SISTER. You should have at least talked to her before going on to tell her boyfriend.", "Yeeeeeeep", "Finn needs to dip out from this family asap.", "Pure intentions \u2026 like she wants him? \n\nIf that\u2019s the case she said the age gap = ew basically and she had a bf of 2years", "She has a boyfriend, I\u2019m pretty sure she threw that in to show that they\u2019ve become friends and good friends at that as they have loads in common but at the end of the day it\u2019s her sister so she tried to say it to her sister first in hopes she change for him but she didn\u2019t", "Agreed.\n\"and honestly, the age gap is just too much\" (paraphrased).\n\nESH", "Definitely not, feelings aside she was a cheater. He deserved to know.", "Are you the sister?", "Brain dead take, She already found out her sister was cheating 6 months in. She's the Ahole simply for not telling him sooner, but the sister is a serial cheater. Of course it's based off history, her sister has never stopped cheating on her partner's.", "Yea, I don't believe she's over it. The right thing to do would have been to tell Finn while the sister was cheating, not after the incidents and based on second hand information from her mother.\n\n'I thought about it. But I didn\u2019t want to steal my sisters BF. And then I started dating my now BF, and I realized that Finn is a better friend anyway. There\u2019s no spark, we\u2019re just friends.'\n\nLike..the assumption that she could steal her sister's bf. Messy.", "Agree to disagree!", "This comment is adorably naive.", "Yes, he deserved to know...YEARS ago when she first started cheating on him.\n\nESH, except for Finn. \n\nOP sounds like she's got a serious crush on Finn. If she hadn't thought about dating him, she would never have considered the age gap between them being a deal breaker.", "I thought about it. But I didn\u2019t want to steal my sisters BF.

Well, we\u2019ll say ESH except Finn. Because your sister obviously sucks\nFor being a cheat and your mom is a gossipy busy body as well.", "Omg !! You thought you could steal your sisters bf ??\ud83d\ude02 yeah you are so Into Finn \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I hope Finn gets away and stays away from both of you and is no longer in the middle of the games you and  your sister play"]}
