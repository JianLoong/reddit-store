My sister and I have never had a good relationship, we are not close and don\u2019t talk much. But we are both somewhat close to our mom (her more than me) so I know about most of her major life things that way. My sister has had 6 (maybe more) boyfriends before Finn, and has cheated on every single one. That\u2019s why they all left her. Previously I didn\u2019t really care, I didn\u2019t want to be involved - but I met Finn at a family dinner right when she started seeing him, and we really hit it off. He\u2019s a super sweet and fun person to talk to, and we have similar jobs and hobbies. We\u2019ve been close friends for the last few years.\n\nSo when I found out that my sister was cheating on him (6 months after she started dating him), I called her up and gave it to her straight. I said he\u2019s an amazing guy and way too good for her, and if she got her shit together and stopped cheating, she could maybe actually deserve him, and have a chance. I thought she listened, because they\u2019ve been together for way longer than any of her other boyfriends lasted.\n\nBut I guess Finn is just too trusting and unsuspicious, because my mom told me last week that she\u2019s cheated on Finn with 4 women in the last 2 years. In the same conversation when she said they were engaged. I was shocked and appalled, so I told Finn about this that evening. I said that my sister didn\u2019t deserve him and he should cut and run. He was understandably furious and did break up with her straight away. Now my sister is furious with me, she says it was none of my business to interfere and also because she\u2019s not currently cheating on Finn, I was bringing up \u201cancient history\u201d because I was jealous and want to date him. This is riduculous, I live with my boyfriend of 2 years and honestly, the age gap between me and Finn is way too much. We\u2019re just friends, and have never been anything more while she\u2019s been cheating on him for years. So anyway, am I the asshole for interfering her?

For you it is best to not include yourself in their circle as in future it can consume your mental health, for know you are relatively young so you still have chance in life every person you have crush on or are really nice doesn't really mean they think of you the same, as for your sister you shouldn't really talk bad or have any negative movements with her or your mother as it can affect your mother. also just stop caring about things that doesn't affect you.(I am just a random guy who just thought to give my thoughts and my words ARE NOT MENT TO BE A ADVICE it is just a thought you can consider)", "YTA.

She might be holding on to the theory that because it's a woman (same sex) it's not really cheating (it is, but cheaters will find any excuse to justify their actions). It's sad though.

Later she married this horrible serial cheater and when he hit on me (he was the type to hit on everyone as was the first guy) I kept it to myself. I never went to her house again to avoid him but she always visited my house so thankfully our friendship was preserved. She is super sweet and trusting. He proceeded to cheat with various women for the next 15 years before he left her and her kids for good for another woman. The crazy part is that she knew about the affairs and always made excuses for him and took him back. If I had told her about it, it just would have destroyed our friendship. So while you are NTA, I hope you don\u2019t end up with all of them thinking that YTA. Good luck.", "NTA.  You have no duty to cover for her.
