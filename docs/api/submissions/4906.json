I hate when people try to hug me when I'm frustrated as well. It feels almost demeaning,  like they think I'm a child. You've told him more than once that you don't like it and it doesn't help. So, I'm not sure HOW he can think he is helping.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he doesn't care about your boundaries and body autonomy is bad enough, but that he plays victim and punishes you for it is a real mindfuck.\n\nIt would be one thing if he just got a little mad, but it effects you for DAYS. This is not sustainable. This is emotional abuse, honestly. \n\nYou're *here* asking if you are an asshole because he simply won't treat you with respect!", "NTA. He gets mad for a few days over something you've repeatedly told him upsets you. \n\nThis doesn't seem healthy or at all happy", "NTA. Each person has their own \"love language\" and if this is how you operate, your husband should respect that. It can be tough esp. since it seems like his \"love language\"' involves touching, but \n\n>We've been married a long time so I should know better.\n\nis quite relevant.", "NTA, I totally get it. \n\nMy ex-husband used to find me adorable when I was cooking. He would come up behind me and put his arms around me to hug me, clamping my arms at my sides. This sounds sweet, right? But with my arms clamped at my sides, I can't stir the pie filling. If you know about pie filling (like for a lemon meringue pie) you know it has to be stirred *constantly* or it gets lumpy and may burn. \n\nI tried explaining this to him, told him I loved him and would be happy to hug him when I wasn't trying to cook, but he said he couldn't help it, I was just so adorable when I was cooking. It was like he completely discounted my wants and needs, in favor of his need to squish me like a stuffed animal. \n\nI understand that he felt hurt, and he felt like I should be willing to put up with the food I was trying to make coming out burnt and lumpy in order to spare his feelings, but it was SO frustrating! His feelings aren't the only ones that matter. My feelings matter too. \n\nSame deal here-- your feelings matter too.", "NTA. You're frustrated, then he does something he *knows* you don't like, and you're wondering if you're the asshole for not appeasing him?\n\nNope, not the asshole at all. \n\nAs far as helpful guidance goes, this sounds like he isn't sure what sort of love language to use in these moments. Have you provided him an alternative way to comfort you? For example, \"I don't like to be touched when I'm frustrated, but really space is the nicest thing you can give me and I'll look forward to the extra affection once I've calmed down.\" Or, \"I don't like being touched when I'm frustrated, but if you ever wanted to make me a nice lil' cup of tea I would love that.\"", "NTA  Your husband doesn't respect you or your boundaries.  You should be able to say no to physical contact for any reason at any time.  And you should be able to have a standing agreement that hugging is not the go-to action when you're stressed.  The fact that he expects you to apologize is just beyond the pale here.  You're in a toxic relationship where his viewpoint on this has become the norm.", "NTA, I also hate this - when I'm frustrated or under pressure, I need to focus On The Thing, and someone trying to hug me would just make me feel claustrophobic.\n\nIt's obvious that him hugging you these times is about helping *him*, not about helping you. If you haven't pointed this out to him, you should, and ask why he's determined to stress you out more. You shouldnt have to put in the time consuming and costly work of changinf this stress response, when the easy and painless answer is for him to offer another gesture or wait until you're in the clear.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband used to try that with me, and it took a couple times to get him to understand that I don't appreciate it. He can hug *after* but not *during*. And it clicked pretty well when I pointed out that he would *never* appreciate that behavior from me.", "NTA- as someone who doesn't like hugs I totally understand. I'm assuming you've always been like this and he got into a relationship knowing this. \n\nBeing respectful and understanding each others boundaries is mportant.", "NTA. Tell him to hug you later when you've worked through the problem as a 'congrats, you did it' gesture, and if that's not good enough then he gets no hugs at all.", "NTA. I hate people wanting to hug me when I am angry or stressed. He wants you to make him feel better by violating your own body. He is the one that is mean and he should be ashamed of himself for manipulating you. Does he do this with other things as well?", "NTA. Most toddlers understand the word \u2018No\u2019 and \u2018not now\u2019. He\u2019s a grown man he should understand and Respect your clear boundaries.", "NTA\nI don\u2019t get that you should know better. He is the one who should know better. I don\u2019t like giving someone a hug just randomly. I had a neighbor just show up and ask for a hug. I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra so I really didn\u2019t want to. I just went for light tapping on the shoulder and tried to stay back. Now that I think of it maybe asking for a hug is just another way for a man to have some power over you and making you the bad guy for saying no to an \u201cinnocent\u201d hug.", "Nta.

I ask her first if she is ok with me hugging her, every time. If she says no, that's fine and we move on.

It goes both ways", "you need to look at things in a different light. he's not doing this to help you, you obviously have made it very clear that you don't like this, he knows that and continues to do it. so he knowingly does something you don't like against your wishes. he's a grown man, he understands.\n\nhonestly seems like he's a narcissist and this is him forcing it so that he's the victim and you're the one having to apologize and fix things, and not the other way around. you blaming yourself in this thread / comments show the dynamic that's been established. and you questioning yourself and saying maybe you should just go along with it, that's his actions chipping away at you and your boundaries.\n\nNTA, this is textbook behavior and he's gaslighting you. DARVO - deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender", "This. If someone is persisting with something like this after telling them multiple times it makes you uncomfortable, they are doing it for them and not for you. \n\nI had a family member who would actively cause the upset/ frustration/ anger (usually hours of being screamed at for some minor infraction, real or imagined) and when you finally broke or got upset, it would make them uncomfortable and they\u2019d go in for the hug (usually while \u201cgently\u201d telling you off for \u201coverreacting\u201d to constructive criticism, smh). To this day I have issues with being touched or hugged (as do my brothers) but especially if I\u2019m upset. I feel so bad for OP, having to deal with additional stimulus when you are already overwhelmed by emotion can be too much.", "That\u2019s really sweet! You\u2019re a good friend.\n\nMy bestie does Jazz Hands / Spirit Fingers (the hug emoji always looked like jazz hands to us), it\u2019s become our thing when I just can\u2019t with a hug in that moment.", "Wow. You have had to put up with some awful men. I shouldn't have to feel glad that none of my bosses ever hit me up for secks."]}
