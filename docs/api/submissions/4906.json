So my husband has this habit of trying to hug me when I'm really frustrated or in a time crunch.   I've told him many times that I don't like it, and it just causes more frustration.  He always  gets upset when I say not now or no. He will be angry for a few days or until I apologize for being mean. (He sees my rejection as me being mean to him.)  I'm not a person who really likes to be touched so being hugged while I'm angry or frustrated is the last thing I want.  My thought is that I might be TA because it takes 5 secs to appease him  but I tell him no everytime and get more upset because I feel like he is not listening to me. We've been married a long time so I should know better.

I hate when people try to hug me when I'm frustrated as well. It feels almost demeaning,  like they think I'm a child. You've told him more than once that you don't like it and it doesn't help. So, I'm not sure HOW he can think he is helping.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he doesn't care about your boundaries and body autonomy is bad enough, but that he plays victim and punishes you for it is a real mindfuck.\n\nIt would be one thing if he just got a little mad, but it effects you for DAYS. This is not sustainable. This is emotional abuse, honestly. \n\nYou're *here* asking if you are an asshole because he simply won't treat you with respect!", "NTA. He gets mad for a few days over something you've repeatedly told him upsets you. \n\nThis doesn't seem healthy or at all happy", "NTA. Each person has their own \"love language\" and if this is how you operate, your husband should respect that. It can be tough esp. since it seems like his \"love language\"' involves touching, but \n\n>We've been married a long time so I should know better.\n\nis quite relevant.", "NTA, I totally get it. \n\nMy ex-husband used to find me adorable when I was cooking. He would come up behind me and put his arms around me to hug me, clamping my arms at my sides. This sounds sweet, right? But with my arms clamped at my sides, I can't stir the pie filling. If you know about pie filling (like for a lemon meringue pie) you know it has to be stirred *constantly* or it gets lumpy and may burn. \n\nI tried explaining this to him, told him I loved him and would be happy to hug him when I wasn't trying to cook, but he said he couldn't help it, I was just so adorable when I was cooking. It was like he completely discounted my wants and needs, in favor of his need to squish me like a stuffed animal. \n\nI understand that he felt hurt, and he felt like I should be willing to put up with the food I was trying to make coming out burnt and lumpy in order to spare his feelings, but it was SO frustrating! His feelings aren't the only ones that matter. My feelings matter too. \n\nSame deal here-- your feelings matter too.", "NTA. You're frustrated, then he does something he *knows* you don't like, and you're wondering if you're the asshole for not appeasing him?\n\nNope, not the asshole at all. \n\nAs far as helpful guidance goes, this sounds like he isn't sure what sort of love language to use in these moments. Have you provided him an alternative way to comfort you? For example, \"I don't like to be touched when I'm frustrated, but really space is the nicest thing you can give me and I'll look forward to the extra affection once I've calmed down.\" Or, \"I don't like being touched when I'm frustrated, but if you ever wanted to make me a nice lil' cup of tea I would love that.\"", "NTA  Your husband doesn't respect you or your boundaries.  You should be able to say no to physical contact for any reason at any time.  And you should be able to have a standing agreement that hugging is not the go-to action when you're stressed.  The fact that he expects you to apologize is just beyond the pale here.  You're in a toxic relationship where his viewpoint on this has become the norm.", "NTA, I also hate this - when I'm frustrated or under pressure, I need to focus On The Thing, and someone trying to hug me would just make me feel claustrophobic.\n\nIt's obvious that him hugging you these times is about helping *him*, not about helping you. If you haven't pointed this out to him, you should, and ask why he's determined to stress you out more. You shouldnt have to put in the time consuming and costly work of changinf this stress response, when the easy and painless answer is for him to offer another gesture or wait until you're in the clear.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband used to try that with me, and it took a couple times to get him to understand that I don't appreciate it. He can hug *after* but not *during*. And it clicked pretty well when I pointed out that he would *never* appreciate that behavior from me.", "NTA- as someone who doesn't like hugs I totally understand. I'm assuming you've always been like this and he got into a relationship knowing this. \n\nBeing respectful and understanding each others boundaries is mportant.", "NTA. Tell him to hug you later when you've worked through the problem as a 'congrats, you did it' gesture, and if that's not good enough then he gets no hugs at all.", "NTA. I hate people wanting to hug me when I am angry or stressed. He wants you to make him feel better by violating your own body. He is the one that is mean and he should be ashamed of himself for manipulating you. Does he do this with other things as well?", "NTA. Most toddlers understand the word \u2018No\u2019 and \u2018not now\u2019. He\u2019s a grown man he should understand and Respect your clear boundaries.", "NTA\nI don\u2019t get that you should know better. He is the one who should know better. I don\u2019t like giving someone a hug just randomly. I had a neighbor just show up and ask for a hug. I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra so I really didn\u2019t want to. I just went for light tapping on the shoulder and tried to stay back. Now that I think of it maybe asking for a hug is just another way for a man to have some power over you and making you the bad guy for saying no to an \u201cinnocent\u201d hug.", "Nta. Why can't he ever appease you and just not hug you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Him sulking for days over something he knows you don't like is absolutely childish and selfish. He knows you don't like it and that it doesn't help, but he can't deal with not being able to help you and does something he knows is wrong, then acts like a baby about it", "NTA  You have been married a long time and HE should know better by now.    \nEven in a good marriage you are allowed personal boundaries that includes personal space when you want it for whatever reason.", "NTA \n\nYou don\u2019t want to be touched. He needs to respect that you don\u2019t want to be touched.", "You've been married a long time, so HE should know better.\n\n\nThat one was somehow an eye opener for my DH.\n\nNTA", "If you ask him for a hug, I hope he tells you \"No\", turns around and walks away.", "NTA but I don't think he is either. It's probably just a natural reaction for him and he loves you so in his mind he's trying to make you feel better but essentially he's making it worse.", "Thank you so much!! That is exactly how it feels.", "I don\u2019t even do that with my kids! I will ask them if they want a hug but respect if they say no. One of them hates hugs when they are angry or embarrassed and has done since they were really little, and I\u2019ve never forced them.", "And he will stay angry FOR DAYS?  What an immature narcissist.  \n\nTry this: when he is watching a sporting event and getting upset at the screen, turn it off and tell him that you are helping him, since he seems so upset.  See how he likes that.", "Couldn't have said it better!", "A relationship where one person hates being hugged by their SO sounds wonderful...", "Thank you! Yes,  this is why I feel like I am TA. I know this is his response to these situations.  It wouldn't kill me to just hug him back.  I try explaining why at the time, but it never helps.", "Hi,  thank you for your response.  Yes, we've discussed it many times.  I've told him to just let me be until I finish whatever it is that's causing me frustration, and he never listens. I'm really not sure if I'm not communicating clearly enough or if he just thinks he knows better.", "My sis doesn't like hugs, I do. So what do I do... I ask her first if she is ok with me hugging her, every time. If she says no, that's fine and we move on. On the other hand my sis knows that I like hugs, so sometimes she'll come up to me and offer a hug. Because we respect each other and can appreciate our differences.", "Yeah, my mother has a tendency to point out every little thing that she sees as wrong/incomplete/imperfect, particularly in things I am doing. She has explained that she thinks she is helping. And I have explained that the first few times I called her out on it, sure, maybe she did. But at some point, you have been told over and over that this is unhelpful. So you have now started *actively hurting* me. Just because someone believes themselves to have good intentions doesn't mean they're actually doing good things.", "I would say a marriage where you hate being hugged by your husband isn\u2019t the best scenario", "Mutually assured destruction is definitely the way to deal with this.", "If he repeatedly ignores your requests to not hug you when you are frustrated, it is no longer an issue of love language. He is putting his wants/needs/feelings above yours. Pouting for days afterwards makes this even worse. He\u2019s not a child, he knows what he is doing and is manipulating you into feeling bad.", "And he should know your response to being hugged when you\u2019re frustrated! \nIt\u2019s not the reason you\u2019re TA, it\u2019s all the more reason that he is.", "He 100% should know better than to violate a clear boundary. This is NOT on you to \"know better\".", "He's not trying to make you feel better. He's uncomfortable when you are frustrated. He says he is trying to comfort you but in reality it's all about him. If he can \"make\" you feel better then he'll feel better. If it was about comforting you he would respect how you feel. He definitely wouldn't get mad. He's being selfish.", "Unless he's a *total idiot*, trust me, he knows", "What are you talking about?  Just because two people are married doesn't give them the right to disregard boundaries their partner has"]}
