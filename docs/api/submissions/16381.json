Everyone got along with one another. Everyone but her sister (24). Me and her sister have had many arguments over the littlest of things and she had gone as far as insult me by talking about the way i look and the way i treat my own relationship. After the next and last argument, me and my girlfriend had a deep conversation about how all this has gotten to stop. It had gotten to the point where her sister would create fake social media profiles just to bully and harass me. But, my girlfriend begged me to leave it alone and assured me nothing else would happen between me and her. But a few days later she would continue the constant bullying. I was genuinely tired of her acting like this towards me, sure i\u2019ve said things back to her but nothing out of line. But shortly after this, my girlfriend let me in on something extremely dark - for me at least . my worst fear is for my girlfriend to cheat on me. Which thankfully didn\u2019t happen, but it was happening to her sister\u2019s boyfriend (24) of 5 years. As soon as i found this out i was in shock. Sure she was rude but i didn\u2019t know she was disloyal. But here\u2019s the part that i think i was in the wrong for. Her sister (still continuing to harass me) would always brag about her relationship and how well they were doing. But as the man i am, i just couldn\u2019t stand to see someone believe such a cruel lie. He seemed genuinely happy in his relationship and it really hurt me to take his joy away. So i asked him to speak , and we did. We spoke for hours, at first it was just about things we both enjoyed and how we loved video games and dirtbikes. But then it got serious. I told him about not only about her cheating, about her cheating with multiple men, multiple times. I didn\u2019t do this because it was funny or i wanted to ruin the relationship. I did this because he didn\u2019t deserve to live in a fake reality. I felt horrible after i told him. He was in shock. His face pale and eyes starting to look glassy. Instantly tears started to flow down his face as he begged me to tell him i was joking. But sadly, it wasn\u2019t far from the truth. He left in a hurry back to the house that they both lived in. I didn\u2019t witness or hear anything first hand but my girlfriend was very upset with me when she explained that he had went home in a rage, packed all his stuff and left all while screaming at his girlfriend. It honestly bothers me to know i ruined a perfectly good relationship. Anyways, i just got news that he sold the house without telling her and moved in with his friends in an apartment until he could find a new place.

Like, nah. If my sister was cheating on her boyfriend, I\u2019d go to his house ASAP. I\u2019d burn that bridge with any family member because cheating is just disgusting. If she got pregnant, I\u2019d wager she\u2019d try and pass the baby off as his. Truly disgusting, repulsive behavior. \n\nAlso, since your Gf is mad, sit her down and tell her exactly the truth. Tell her it\u2019s a deal breaker for you and you can\u2019t support a cheater so you had to tell him. \n\nThere was actually a post I read some time ago about a woman that found out her boyfriends brother was cheating. Not only did she tell the other woman, she also dumped her own bf because he was covering for his brother. I agree - if you\u2019re covering for someone cheating, or you\u2019re staying silent, it\u2019s a pretty big red flag. Unless it directly impacts your living situation, you shouldn\u2019t stand for any of that or allow it to go on. I\u2019m not saying you should break up with your gf but you should have a very serious conversation and deeply reflect on yourself and your relationship. \n\nAlso, your gf begged you to stop being mean to her sister even after she was harassing you in rude ways. She went beyond the normal \u201cI don\u2019t like X\u2019s SO\u201d,  but harassed you online as well. She defended her sister and allowed her to do that, which is another red flag. It seems as thought her sister is jealous of something - perhaps your relationship with your gf? Or maybe she likes you? Could be a lot of things. Maybe tell your gf this could be a dealbreaker for you and you want 100% honesty and you want things to change.", "That relationship wasn\u2019t \u201cperfectly good\u201d if she was spreading her legs like the sister said she was.

I would want someone to tell me if that were the case, assuming they had evidence, but I'm not sure how I would feel about it coming from a total stranger.  I'm mostly just disappointed in your girlfriend for defending that behavior from her sister.  I think maybe a conversation is in order.  I know people can be blind to their family's toxicity sometimes.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin anything, your gf\u2019s sister did. And your gf was kind of making you keep it from the bf. You did a good thing.", "NTA, but your GF is the LAST person to be chastising anyone about cheating considering she cheated on AND with you.
