Everyone got along with one another. Everyone but her sister (24). Me and her sister have had many arguments over the littlest of things and she had gone as far as insult me by talking about the way i look and the way i treat my own relationship. After the next and last argument, me and my girlfriend had a deep conversation about how all this has gotten to stop. It had gotten to the point where her sister would create fake social media profiles just to bully and harass me. But, my girlfriend begged me to leave it alone and assured me nothing else would happen between me and her. But a few days later she would continue the constant bullying. I was genuinely tired of her acting like this towards me, sure i\u2019ve said things back to her but nothing out of line. But shortly after this, my girlfriend let me in on something extremely dark - for me at least . my worst fear is for my girlfriend to cheat on me. Which thankfully didn\u2019t happen, but it was happening to her sister\u2019s boyfriend (24) of 5 years. As soon as i found this out i was in shock. Sure she was rude but i didn\u2019t know she was disloyal. But here\u2019s the part that i think i was in the wrong for. Her sister (still continuing to harass me) would always brag about her relationship and how well they were doing. But as the man i am, i just couldn\u2019t stand to see someone believe such a cruel lie. He seemed genuinely happy in his relationship and it really hurt me to take his joy away. So i asked him to speak , and we did. We spoke for hours, at first it was just about things we both enjoyed and how we loved video games and dirtbikes. But then it got serious. I told him about not only about her cheating, about her cheating with multiple men, multiple times. I didn\u2019t do this because it was funny or i wanted to ruin the relationship. I did this because he didn\u2019t deserve to live in a fake reality. I felt horrible after i told him. He was in shock. His face pale and eyes starting to look glassy. Instantly tears started to flow down his face as he begged me to tell him i was joking. But sadly, it wasn\u2019t far from the truth. He left in a hurry back to the house that they both lived in. I didn\u2019t witness or hear anything first hand but my girlfriend was very upset with me when she explained that he had went home in a rage, packed all his stuff and left all while screaming at his girlfriend. It honestly bothers me to know i ruined a perfectly good relationship. Anyways, i just got news that he sold the house without telling her and moved in with his friends in an apartment until he could find a new place.

You didn't ruin a perfectly good relationship as a good relationship doesn't involve one of the parties consistently cheating.", "NTA, but you have a girlfriend problem my dude, you need to get her to have your back or leave, cause if she never stands up for you things are gonna get way worse.

That's anything but perfect, you did the guy a favor by telling him the truth, your girlfriends sister obviously wasn't gonna fess up anytime soon, and like you stated it's not fair to let people live in a fake reality while somebody pulls the wool over their eyes. If anything I'm kinda disappointed in your gf for just allowing it to happen and acting like it's just gossip and not a serious issue she should help her sister resolve.

Seriously, she can't confide in you without you blowing up the world around her? That's the real problem here. You broke the faith between yourself and your woman. (Pssssst.
