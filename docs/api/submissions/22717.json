I\u2019m assuming your reason to not invite your brother is because your parents will somehow make it about him too, which seems possible with what you\u2019ve described.\n\nMaybe you can have a conversation with them and explain them your reasoning. Have a separate conversation with your brother too. If they get your POV and are willing to positively proceed, great. If they don\u2019t, move on if they\u2019re not bringing good energy in your life.\n\nFor all those saying it\u2019s not the brother\u2019s fault, it probably isn\u2019t. However, OP seems to have some trauma/resentment when it comes to her brother. If she doesn\u2019t want him around her, that\u2019s her call.", "NTA. Don't let your parents guilt-trip you into ruining the occasion.", "I think it depends on your brother's behaviour. You've told us how he's been spoiled, and your parents are definitely assholes for that, but is he awful to be around or is he as much a victim of his upbringing and you're just fed up of how differently he's been treated? It's hard to say without knowing the central facts of what he's like to you. I'm sorry you had such a tough time, though.", "NTA. Although your brother could possibly be a good person who just happened to be favorited, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t affect your party if he\u2019s there. If he is that favorited, it doesn\u2019t matter how your brother acts, it\u2019s about how your parents act towards your brother. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s your brother, parents, or both being the problem, so I\u2019m afraid that is going to have to be the extent of my judgement for now.", "NTA. Sounds like your brother isn't the issue: it's your parents forcing his happiness onto yours. If it were your bro alone calling and asking to come, that'd be different, but this seems a continuation of a pattern of favoritism. Your \"INFO\" just confirms it. I'd stay strong, say no, and eventually maybe reach out to bro to have a parent-free relationship with him. But as long as they're pushing him onto you, there's no blame in keeping your distance.", "According to your comments:\n\n>I wouldn't have minded if it was just him but the way my parents behave around him in unbearable\n\n>I have no problem if he came alone but my parents won't take no for an answer\n\nIt doesn't sound like brother is the problem. Your parents, on the other hand, are. Your brother didn't ask to be treated so differently. Your parents did a disservice to both of you, just in different ways. They've already created a divide between you two, don't add to it. Don't let him take the fall for you parents shortcomings. He doesn't deserve it, just as you don't deserve how differently they treated you.", "NTA.\n\nYou tried to tell your parents that it\u2019s not a good idea for them to visit. You also specified that you\u2019d be okay with your brother visiting by himself. At this point, you\u2019re trying to avoid trauma your parents inflicted with their bad habits.\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019d be careful with how you word things for your brother\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s truly as fragile as your parents make him out to be, but being rejected by a sibling is almost a universally hurtful thing, and your uninviting of him might give that impression. You armed your parents with fodder to sabotage your relationship with your brother, however weak or strong it might be, if they want to.", "NTA sand I\u2019ll add that all of the little precious people here who tell you that you shouldn\u2019t treat you brother like this:\n\nHas he once tried to contact you in those 10 years and ask why you don\u2019t talk to him?
