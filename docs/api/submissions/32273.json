My mom was asking about the guest list and mentioning my sister Jade (22f) and quizzing me and my other siblings Jesse (20m) and Jovie (16f) on whether she is invited or not. I have talked more openly to my siblings than my mom. I know she doesn't want Jade to be invited.\n\nSome background on why: My siblings and I lost our dad 14 years ago. Our mom remarried 8 years ago. Jade hated that mom remarried and was always distant and disinterested in our stepsiblings and stepdad. She and mom argued all the time because mom would say we had more siblings now and a new parent and Jade told her she only had two parents and three siblings and our stepdad and stepsiblings were nothing to her. My stepsiblings were all younger than the rest of us so it hurt their feelings that Jade was so disinterested.\n\nMom put Jade in therapy and the fighting continued for years. It all got worse when Jade hung up a mural she made in her art class and it included mom, dad, Jesse, Jovie and me. But not our stepdad or stepsiblings. Mom told Jade that it was incredibly cruel to treat them as if they don't exist. Jade told her it's in her room so nobody else should see it. Mom told her that can't always be helped and Jade told her to make sure the brats know the rules and their feelings won't get hurt.\n\nWhen Jade turned 18 she moved in with our grandparents. She and mom don't talk anymore but Jesse, Jovie and me still talk to her. We're still close. We see her at least once a week. We also have sibling dinners at our grandparents house and stuff.\n\nMy stepsiblings were really upset about Jade and they don't like when she's mentioned because they see her as their sister but they also know she doesn't care about them.\n\nThis is why mom feels I should not invite Jade. She said I have younger siblings to think about and their feelings should be prioritized over my grown woman of a sister who made a choice to never give us a chance to be one family, and who chose to make our stepsiblings lesser siblings in her eyes.\n\nI want Jade at my party though. She's my sister and she's honestly one of my favorite people in the world. She has been there for me through a lot of shit. I told mom Jade was invited whether she likes it or not. Mom told me I'm a minor in her home and I do as she says. I told her she's not paying for this party though and she has no say in this, she does not get to make decisions for my party. Mom told me I was behaving like a little shit and choosing Jade over my younger siblings. She also told me I was speaking to her like she wasn't my mom and she didn't raise me and like I don't still live under her roof.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701608285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189sze8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_does_not_get_to_make/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can\u2019t see you keeping contact with her once you leave. She can\u2019t deal with the fact her kids have their own thoughts\u2026how silly.", "NTA. Your mum has made the same mistake many remarried parents make: They try with an iron fist to make one family as if there have been no traumatic events in the meantime. They want everyone to accept the new family absolutely seamlessly. If they could completely erase the old family, they would. This is so wrong of them. The more the older children are allowed to cherish the memories of their first family, the greater the chances are that they will eventually grow to like the second family. In other words, your mum is so out of line here, and by the sound of it, she has been for years. I am sorry you and your siblings are having to put up with this.", "NTA. Perhaps try and host your birthday someplace else.", "NTA. Your mother is trying to force you to ostracize your own sister, HER DAUGHTER. She drove her own child out of her home, because she chose her husband's children over her own grieving daughter. She doesn't have any room to talk about mistreating family, or choosing one family over another, after how she's treated Jade.", "NTA but your mother is a massive one and failed as a parent.

It seems that Jade and your mum grieved in different ways and this enabled the rift to break their relationship apart. Your mum may feel intense grief because she may see that the way she coped caused her to lose her daughter too. \n\nBut I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair on your younger step siblings to be caught in the middle\u2026 they are not at fault at all and are just caught in the middle of the situation with your mum and Jade. \n\nCould you speak to Jade and ask her to be kind and civil to the step family and your mum for your benefit? \nSpeak to your mum and explain that they can both be civil with eachother because they\u2019re both grown ups. \n\nIf you approach it in a mature way then your mum can\u2019t use the fact that you\u2019re a minor because she\u2019ll just look very hypocritical in the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mom was really annoyed/angry that we never stopped talking to or seeing Jade.", "Is the party being held in your mother's house? If not, she truly does have no say in it; however, If you insist on acting like the adult which you will be, I think you need to make sure that you start to pay rent and not expect to have your cake and eat it too. If you're still going to be living at home rent free, and not paying any bills, which may or not be true in your case, you still need to respect her. \n\nAs far as the party's concerned, if it's not being held in her home, she's not taking on any of the expense, and you will then be eighteen, she really can't control anything about it.", "Exactly this.", "Jade normally stays out of their way whenever she's run into them and I would expect that to happen.

She obviously cares about your step siblings  and her husband more than you or your other bio siblings. She stopped talking to Jade because she didn\u2019t accept her new family. She\u2019s mad that her bio kids still talk to her DAUGHTER because that daughter doesn\u2019t accept the people your mom wants her to. She literally will shut all of you out for your step siblings and husband. Please do not compromise for this woman. She does not have your best interest at heart. It doesn\u2019t sound like she has your interest in mind at all.

I would seriously consider asking them if you can move in with them because of your mom\u2019s behavior.", "Sounds like you're nta then, but you might want to move to your grandparents house if they're okay with that, because this sounds like the kinda situation where living at home as a legal adult is only gotta make things worse for your relationship with your siblings, not better.", "Where she lives?

I'd also ask your mom if she's bound and determined to drive all of her biological children away.

You must obey her, and if she says \u201cJade is out\u201d she has to be out of your life, because she said so\u2026What she doesn\u2019t realize, is that attitude only serves to make her adult children distance themselves more. It\u2019s never easy for a parent to accept their child is now an adult. However, the way she is going about it is wrong.  It sounds like your Mother should have put herself into therapy, as well as have Jade go to therapy. But it\u2019s not to late for her to start now.", "NTA on this since your mom is not paying for it and I assume it's not under her roof.\n\nBut you'd better understand that that under her roof will still give her a certain amount of control over your life. Don't like that? Move out and financially support yourself.", "Your mom was trying to force a relationship between Jade and your stepfamily. Your mom had the prerogative to remarry, but it seems she doesn't acknowledge that who Jade chooses to bond with is Jade's prerogative. Or that who you invite to your birthday party is your prerogative (and partly that of who is hosting the party, which is not your mom). Looks like a 'rules for thee but not for me' situation.\n\nNTA."]}
