I\u2019m genuinely happy for him and his family.\n\nNathan contacted me about 7 years ago after my mom died. It was just to offer his condolences and ask me if I needed anything. I rejected his offer to help me with burying her or anything like that, and I ended up going to school abroad on a scholarship so I didn\u2019t ask him for any financial help later on either.\nWe had some contact but not much. Mostly he\u2019d say happy birthday/happy holidays and I\u2019d say thanks, but there were occasional conversations.\n\nI had a baby in April of last year, and my husband and I finally got around to flying back to the country that I\u2019m from in order to show our daughter where I grew up. I know she won\u2019t remember this trip but it\u2019s important to me that she meet my mom, even if it\u2019s just her headstone.\n\nOne of my mom\u2019s old friends ended up telling Nathan that I was in town, and Nathan ended up calling me and inviting me to eat at a local restaurant. My husband encouraged me to go so I did.\n\nWhen I got there, it was awkward at first and we made some small talk for a minute, but then a few of his friends ended up walking in and coming up to us. They started saying how much my \u201cdad\u201d bragged about me and my siblings, how they\u2019ve been dying to meet his kid who moved to another country for school, etc.\nOne of them said how nice it was that my dad was finally going to be able to meet his granddaughter, and Nathan said how excited he was to do all the things with her that he used to do with me.\n\nI must\u2019ve made a face because Nathan asked what was wrong and I said that I don\u2019t remember any of the things we used to do together because we only started talking again when I was 19 after my mother died, and before then he was either intoxicated or just never around.\n\nHe said that I was making him sound like a bad dad and I said \u201cyou seem like a good one to your kids, but you weren\u2019t my dad at all.\u201d\n\nI left after that and he ended up texting me later saying how crappy it was of me to just throw his past mistakes out there, especially in front of his friends, and that I could\u2019ve picked another time to air out our history.\nI haven\u2019t responded to his texts.\n\nETA:\n\nAll I want from my father is honesty. That\u2019s it. Him fronting to other people that our distance with one another is somehow mutual or no fault of his own is what bothers me. I could forgive him. I want to forgive him. But I can\u2019t forgive him for something that he has never actually apologized for, and apparently hasn\u2019t truly acknowledged either.\n\nAlso some quick info:\n- I didn\u2019t accept his money or help with my mother\u2019s funeral because it felt wrong to let him use his money to bury the woman he emotionally and physically mistreated (to put it nicely) for years\n- The \u201cgood times\u201d he\u2019s reminiscing on aren\u2019t things I remember.

It doesn't matter if you're \"throwing his past mistakes out there\". He painted a false picture of the relationship he had with you, so you just simply enlightened them.

Don't lie.  It sounds like, unless you really want otherwise, that bridge is better left burnt and left in the past because he didn't sound sorry.  It sounds like he wants to pretend it never happened.\n\nReal talk though, that friend of your mother who informed him needs a serious dressing down.  She had no business telling your father you were there without your say so.  If you wanted him to have that info you would have told him yourself.  It's really awful that she decided to meddle and give a man you have a basically non existent relationship with information that you never said you wanted him to have.  Your dad was wrong for lying to his friends, but what that lady did was 100% not okay.", "NTA. You have no obligation to support your bio-dad's story to his friends.

Definitely NTA. Seems quite pointless to lie about it as well since he has his life together now. Just embarrassed by his past now that he has finally kept clean and has a relationship with his younger children to give him perspective on his previous failures. You are under no obligation to lie for him and really it doesn't seem like keeping a relationship with him benefits you at all. Maybe this will be a good moment to allow you both to stop attempting to linger on something that doesn't exist.", "NTA. He wanted to rewrite history to make himself sound good, whereas you told the truth. What did he expect? He was never a father to you, did he think you'd just sit there and let him bs (and in doing so take away from all the hard work your mother did)?\n\nReminds me a lot of my own \"father\" and our relationship.", "Nta..and he is a huge one for trying to rewrite history by acting like he was a great dad to you. You were much nicer than I would have been..I probably would have been much more snarky and said something like \"Oh...do stuff like be an absentee father and drunk/junkie around his granddaughter like he was with you\". He could have been more honest and say something about making up for his mistakes that he made with you growing up...but instead tried to make himself and the part he played in your childhood or lack of more accurately. His getting his shit together now does not get to whitewash his past screw up with you.", "NTA how dare he lie. He outed it when he lied and he kept lying to your face in front of them.\n\nHonestly after what happened I'd write everything down, post it on social media to his family and friends and then go no contact for good. Its one thing to be absent which was horrific, but to lie about it and make it seem how good he was - thats a whole new level of disgraceful.", "NTA, this sounds like he glossed over reality in an attempt to impress his friends with you. And it sounds like you are where you are in life, and have achieved the successes you have in spite of him, not because of him. So yea, NTA for correcting that.

Yeah, it sucks that he didn\u2019t do right by you when you were younger, but he did get help, and turned things around.\n\nTo clarify:\nI am not saying you are wrong for telling him off.\nBut the error in judgment that you made was to do so in such a public manner. It may not have been your intention when you agreed to meet. But you had opportunity and were self aware enough to excuse your self from the situation prior to blowing up.

He centered himself as the wronged party because you told the truth. You deserve better than this.", "But he lied, if he hadnt made it all up then he wouldnt have embarrassed himself. Also it was one thing him lying to his friends - but then to your face he lied and said  \" how excited he was to do all the things with her that he used to do with me.\" Thats re-writing history in a cruel way to you. All he needed to say was I'm sad that I never got to do things with you, but I would love to be part of your life and share experiences with you and your child.\n\nAnd why shouldnt he be ashamed.

I mean, given that he \"brags\" about the op all the time and stuff and never even gave them an inkling that he wasn't all there when OP was actually a kid, he's practically lied by omission.

Nothing can be resolved if he\u2019s still pretending it never happened.\n\nExpecting her to be the bigger person and cover for him in front of others is unfair.", "Nope, he lied and tried to cornered OP to maintain his lie.

He ended up committing suicide after I refused his offer to live with him and expressed how stressed I was with him. He was blindsided and couldn't deal. I also think, as a parent now we can misinterpret situations and underestimate how damaging our behaviour can be to a fragile young thing growing up with stress and trauma.

I just wonder if you have the full story.  It seems that you may only have your mom's perspective since they split when you were young.  Also, is it possible that his friends had you confused with your sibling or otherwise confused his word?  I'm not saying you were in the wrong nor am I defending him.  I think that there can be many sides to the story and publicly reacting from hurt and anger usually isn't the way to go.

He didn't apologize, but he DOES know that abandoning you as a child makes him look bad, which is why he lies to people about it. He wants to absolve his guilt, but not badly enough to say he's sorry (because he's not). You're under no obligation to allow his fraud to continue and I hope the people you met tell everyone. Being a deadbeat and a liar is what caused this, you were just there. If the truth ruins his social life, it deserves to be ruined.", "NTA He can't expect you to lie for him if you're not aware he's lying. He also can't expect you to want to lie for him, given the truth. The fact is you were blindsided by this lie and reacted honestly. Then you were directly confronted about that reaction and answered honestly.\n\nIt's not your fault he lied to people whose opinion he cared about and then put you in a position to expose him. And you're not too blame for how people react to his actual behaviour.", "NTA.\n\nYou pulled back the curtain for his friends to see.\n\nNow, go fully NC with this self-centered individual and live your best life.", "Perhaps he thought he'd been an adequate father.  It's still not right to tear a person down in front of others.  Wait until they leave, express your feelings in private, then should it happen again, he gets what he deserves.", "People's ability to selectively remember and rewrite history so they can be comfortable with themselves is incredibly strong.  I agree, there is a very good chance that he's believed his own justifications and stories.", "This. My dad does this all the time and is the reason we are no contact. He apologizes for stuff but does actually change his actions to build our relationship in the present or future. And then when hes mad about me wanting to be LC or NC suddenly it's everyone but his fault and it's all about how he was wronged. I dont know your dad OP but I dont think you guys can really move forward without him apologizing but it's worth pondering does you're bio dads presence only add stress and and anxiety or does it have the potential to be happy and healthy.", "Where is the lie from Ops dad? She herself never said he lied, she just doesn\u2019t remember. It is possible these things happened. \n\nall the actions from Ops dad shows he\u2019s trying. It\u2019s everyone else who is stuck (and not saying it\u2019s wrong to be) in the past. Ops dad is the one trying to move forward. Op is not interested & she has a right to. Doesn\u2019t mean she has to make it nasty too.", "OP's dad was either abusive (when he was around) or otherwise absence. He only cared about OP when she was an adult. He went around bragging about all he did with her as a CHILD. Tell me why HE has a bunch of good memories but OP doesn't. Great, he's making an effort. That does not erase the pain he caused his daughter. Just because you decided to pretend the past never happened doesn't mean that the people you hurt have to as well. Stop defending an abusive parent. They deserve none of it.", "NOT the asshole.", "I wouldn't call you an A H but IMO unnecessary. There was no need for this. While I understand he had some issues when you were younger he cleaned up his life and reached out. You shut him out then so this isn't completely on him.", "NTA your bio dad is stealing dad valor, he should get called out and be shamed for it", "Of you didn't like him why even go to dinner \nYTA in this instance", "Why on earth would he just assume you'd go along with his lies to his friends? How does a mind work like that? NTA", "He is the one who lied. OP has no responsibility to maintain those lies.", "I am confused as to what the lie was.\nHe could have said the things that happened prior to the divorce. Just because her perception of her interactions with him are diminished by time doesn\u2019t mean that they didn\u2019t happen.\n\nAnother possibility is that he\u2019s superimposing his memories of his other children onto the missing memories of Op.\n\nThere is no evidence of malicious intent here. Just someone trying to make amends.\n\nNot one person on here knows 100% what was told to his coworkers/friends.\n\nRemember: OP said that she had looked into him and his new family. She said that he seemed like a good husband and father to the new family.\n\nShe was not wanting to go to the meet up, it was her husband who convinced her to go, not her father.\n\nAnd you are absolutely: His relapse would not be on her. If he feels as if he is in danger of falling, he needs to call someone. The responsibility is his.", "I mean you ate saying she should've lied to spare the feelings of a deadbeat dad that never did nothing for her? She did not tear him down, she told yeah \"that's not my experience at all\" she could've done so much worse.", "So are you saying people are not capable of reforming?", "Isn\u2019t that making a presumption?", "Reforming means you own up to what you've done. You don't put on a fake show to preserve your image and get pissed that the people  you hurt don't play along. You keep missing this point,I don't understand why. He (and you) want to rug sweep his behavior and are mad OP refuses to join in.", "NTA.  What did he think you owed your absentee parent.", "I think you're a star for calling him on his BS despite the social situation. Well done. \n\nNTA. He obviously has convinced himself that the past went differently. That's how he lives with himself. You burst that bubble, and he's sulking.  I'm delighted that he got some karma lashback. \n\nAlso, congratulations on building a great life for yourself and your family despite Nathan's shortcomings.", "NTA\u2026and I\u2019m wondering if we have the same dad lol\n\nYou did nothing wrong. And you wouldn\u2019t have needed to say those things in front of his friends had he not embellished the truth (aka lied).", "My piece of trash sperm donor would stalk my sister's social media account and then brag on his account about what is going on with her.  She has nothing to do with him but if you didn't know he would look like this involved father and grandfather when he is far from it.  My nephews don't even know he exists, my niece knows but hasn't officially met him.", "He tried to rewrite OPs history and create a story that never happened or at least a story that OP doesn't know is true or not.  All OP is asking for is for him to acknowledge how OP and her mother was treated by him.", "Don't subject your daughter to that. He (possibly/probably) lied to his friends about what happened she(your daughter) doesn't deserve to be subject to a liar who could drip poison into her ears when she's older. Not to mention that he(bio dad) doesn't deserve YOU or YOUR KID. He's got THREE OTHER KIDS he'll likely get grands from them. He chose to do substances and abuse your mom(maybe you, idk). He made his bed let him lay in it.", "She has had opportunities to have that discussion in private. It was an AH move to do it in public.", "I'm so sorry that happened. The fact that he couldn't deal is on him, not on you. You shouldn't blame yourself in any way.", "Why he lied in public?  He doesn't get to lie to all his friends about his relationship with her and then expect OP to let him continue the lie.  All OP wants him to do is admit what actually happened.  That is the first step that needs to happen to move on, yet he refuses to do this.", "All OP wants him to do is to admit the truth about what he has done to her and her mother.  This generation as you put it is done with putting up with toxic people just because they share biological material with them.  He doesn't get to rewrite OPs history to make himself look like this great father when he was far from it (at least to OP).", "Some ppl think that turning over a new leaf erases all their past mistakes. Hogwash! Being good to your half siblings does not excuse or make up for how you and your mom were treated by him. He shojld be grateful you didn't get into specifics. NTA but your dad is.", "NTA - Heard something a lot growing up and it stuck. \"If you don't want people to know you've done something, don't do it\"\n\nWorse, he was lying to them about the kind of dad he was to you IN FRONT OF YOU. He was asking for it", "NTA- you told his friends the truth and unwittingly exposed the facts that he was probably most desperate to hide as he rewrites his history & plays the part of devoted family man to his current partner, children and most people who know them. \n\nIf he is a liar as well as a deadbeat dad to you, he deserves for everyone to know the truth.", "NTA, truth hurts", "Nope, NTA. \"Dad\" doesn't want to be looked at as an AH, maybe dad shouldnt have been an AH.", "This is a really common thing. They lie to themselves and surround themselves with people who don't know the truth. When you bring reality to light they shoot the messenger.\n\nHe didn't even know you were in the country until a mutual friend told him. Clearly, you're not close, and he knows that.\n\nYou're NTA and I love your line about \"how can I move past something he hasn't apologized for?\"", "You're projecting. His memories of her very early childhood may be vastly different from hers. While she admits she doesn't have many memories at all, he may only have good ones, thanks in part to the substance abuse. Nothing in OP's post says that he \"refuses\" to admit anything. In fact, it doesn't appear that they've had any discussion more than \"Happy Birthday\" in the last 7 years. She wants him to admit what actually happened? Fine. Sit down and discuss it, painful as it might be."]}
