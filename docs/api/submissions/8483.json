Airing out the dirty laundry is never right.  You did it to be vindictive and hurtful.", "Honestly I don\u2019t know what he was expecting either. Had I known he\u2019d just been lying to everyone about why I\u2019m not around, I probably just wouldn\u2019t have met up with him at all.", "You can't open a door then get ticked off when somebody walks through it NTA", "I guess I just feel guilty for embarrassing him like that. The more I think about it, I realize he probably lied about how things were because he was ashamed of his past behavior.", "Now you know unfortunately", "Sounds like he should be ashamed for his past behavior. But he didn\u2019t need to lie, he could have just not said anything. Your reaction was completely normal to hearing him lie. Your feelings are valid but I don\u2019t think you should feel guilty for speaking the truth.", "NTA. He started it by putting on the whole \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Dad\u201d act for his buddies. His representation of your relationship was disingenuous and you had every right to set the record straight. He didn\u2019t have to air out all his dirty laundry. If he\u2019d just kept the details of his relationship with you private, or at least vague, there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. He unfairly blew his own horn and it landed him in an awkward situation - that\u2019s neither your fault nor your problem.", "ESH. It\u2019s understandable why you feel the way you do but substance abuse is a disease and your bio dad suffered from it. Nobody expects you to forgive him but it also sucks what you did and at the same time it obviously sucks what he did in the past. \n\nTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right and what you guys both did were wrong. The difference between the two of you is that he seems to be a better person. You otoh\u2026.", "It seems like you never really wanted a relationship with Nathan but were too polite to tell him to leave you alone. It\u2019s unfortunate that it came out at just that moment but it feels like it must have been a very awkward situation for you. He sounds very narcissistic. Everything he said was about him. Don\u2019t respond to his texts. There\u2019s no way to resolve this where everyone will be happy. NTA", "NTA\n\nNot your job to perpetuate his lies", "So she was supposed to lie for him to everyone even when she is definitely not close to him and he put her in a spot here?", "If you have nothing nice to say\u2026", "Well in case someone is obviously involving me in a lie then this statement does not matter. I will clear out the truth no matter how it makes the other person look. OP's dad is the only asshole here since he lied to everyone to make himself look good.", "That concept is lost on this reddit.", "Based on what op describe nothing in ops post suggest that the dad made a lie at all. Did he omit some facts? Yes but who wants to brag that they had substance abuse? Just because op doesn\u2019t remember his time with her father doesn\u2019t mean the father lied about the time together. \n\nThe only thing op\u2019s dad did was made presumptions that he would see his granddaughter. At the end of the day two wrongs don\u2019t make a right and op made a wrong to", "How about \"she was making him sound like a bad dad\" when he knew that he actually was a bad dad to her because of his substance abuse and not having any contact with her for years.", "Plus he must've known how OP felt but yet he asked clarification on what was wrong about his words.", "I get it. She\u2019s hurt and he was an asshole. \n\nBut heres the thing you don\u2019t understand. She has a chance to be the better person. She could\u2019ve kept her mouth shut at the time, build a relationship with her dad by airing it out privately and moving on. \n\nInstead she chose to be vindictive. She wanted revenge. She chose hate. \n\nAgain, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. He was wrong and so was she", "NTA Your 'dad' was pushing too hard for a relationship that didn't exist. And it was totally wrong of him to paint a different picture of the relationship he had with you to his friends.", "NTA. \n\nIf you're mad about the truth someone told, the answer isn't lying; it's not behaving in a way you're ashamed of in the first place.", "Well\u2026he did this to himself. If these people are his friends why lie about his past. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to rewrite your childhood because he doesn\u2019t like how it makes him look. He was an AH back then and from what he just showed you he\u2019s just a different sort of AH now.", "He's been lying to others to comfort his lying to himself.", "NTA. It's abusive to exploit you to improve his image with his friends like that. Calling him out was soft pushback. His reaction shows his true color--he's not a good father.\n\nMany abusive parents maintain a Facebook friendly image that hides who they are.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to suck it up. It doesn't matter if you're \"throwing his past mistakes out there\". He painted a false picture of the relationship he had with you, so you just simply enlightened them. He wants the credit of you growing into a well adjusted adult and he hasn't even put in the effort to try to make up for it. It doesn't work like that. \n\nIf he didn't want his dirty laundry aired out, then he shouldn't have shit on the sheets in the first place and try to pass it off as clean.", "NTA. if he didn't want to be viewed as a bad dad then he shouldn't have been a bad dad. he fucked around and found out.", "\"Tell your story. If people wanted you to write nicely about them, they should have behaved better.\" \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d honestly just stay away. It sounds like nothing but a trigger to relive trauma because he\u2019s clearly not going to give you any kind of closure. He obviously lies to himself and if he\u2019s like my mom then eventually he might even believe his own lies.", "NTA\n\nThe easiest way to not be embarrassed by being caught out in a lie is actually very simple.  Don't lie.  It sounds like, unless you really want otherwise, that bridge is better left burnt and left in the past because he didn't sound sorry.  It sounds like he wants to pretend it never happened.\n\nReal talk though, that friend of your mother who informed him needs a serious dressing down.  She had no business telling your father you were there without your say so.  If you wanted him to have that info you would have told him yourself.  It's really awful that she decided to meddle and give a man you have a basically non existent relationship with information that you never said you wanted him to have.  Your dad was wrong for lying to his friends, but what that lady did was 100% not okay.", "NTA. You have no obligation to support your bio-dad's story to his friends. You didn't have much of a relationship anyway, so it doesn't sound like a big loss.", "He was expecting you to lie on the spot, hoping you'd feel awkward and inappropriate \"airing out his dirty laundry.\" \n\nNTA", "You did nothing wrong telling the truth. You are not airing dirty laundry to shame him. You told his friends the truth and he got caught out so he is to blame not you. OP, you do you and do not feel bad. \n\nAbout you not answering his texts, you best give yourself space by going LC on him for your sake. I am not going to tell you to go NC on him as the going all NC thing is a tough decision that only you can decide yourself. You do what is right for you", "And if the lie worked he would be absolved of guilt.", "And his friends know. \n\nFAFO, this is all on him pretending to be something he wasn't", "All he needed to do was say he got divorced/split up and could not reconnect until OP was adult. \nNothing particularly shameful in that.\n\nBut he had to pretend to have been this great dad, well... His own fault", "Agreed", "He asked because the pulled a face, she said as much in the post.\nShe said that from what she could see, he as a different person now."]}
