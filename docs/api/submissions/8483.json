But he didn\u2019t need to lie, he could have just not said anything. Your reaction was completely normal to hearing him lie. Your feelings are valid but I don\u2019t think you should feel guilty for speaking the truth.", "NTA. He started it by putting on the whole \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Dad\u201d act for his buddies. His representation of your relationship was disingenuous and you had every right to set the record straight. He didn\u2019t have to air out all his dirty laundry. If he\u2019d just kept the details of his relationship with you private, or at least vague, there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.

It doesn't matter if you're \"throwing his past mistakes out there\". He painted a false picture of the relationship he had with you, so you just simply enlightened them.

Don't lie.  It sounds like, unless you really want otherwise, that bridge is better left burnt and left in the past because he didn't sound sorry.  It sounds like he wants to pretend it never happened.\n\nReal talk though, that friend of your mother who informed him needs a serious dressing down.  She had no business telling your father you were there without your say so.  If you wanted him to have that info you would have told him yourself.  It's really awful that she decided to meddle and give a man you have a basically non existent relationship with information that you never said you wanted him to have.  Your dad was wrong for lying to his friends, but what that lady did was 100% not okay.", "NTA. You have no obligation to support your bio-dad's story to his friends.

You are not airing dirty laundry to shame him. You told his friends the truth and he got caught out so he is to blame not you.

Definitely NTA. Seems quite pointless to lie about it as well since he has his life together now. Just embarrassed by his past now that he has finally kept clean and has a relationship with his younger children to give him perspective on his previous failures. You are under no obligation to lie for him and really it doesn't seem like keeping a relationship with him benefits you at all. Maybe this will be a good moment to allow you both to stop attempting to linger on something that doesn't exist.", "NTA. He wanted to rewrite history to make himself sound good, whereas you told the truth. What did he expect? He was never a father to you, did he think you'd just sit there and let him bs (and in doing so take away from all the hard work your mother did)?\n\nReminds me a lot of my own \"father\" and our relationship.", "Nta..and he is a huge one for trying to rewrite history by acting like he was a great dad to you. You were much nicer than I would have been..I probably would have been much more snarky and said something like \"Oh...do stuff like be an absentee father and drunk/junkie around his granddaughter like he was with you\". He could have been more honest and say something about making up for his mistakes that he made with you growing up...but instead tried to make himself and the part he played in your childhood or lack of more accurately. His getting his shit together now does not get to whitewash his past screw up with you.", "NTA how dare he lie. He outed it when he lied and he kept lying to your face in front of them.\n\nHonestly after what happened I'd write everything down, post it on social media to his family and friends and then go no contact for good. Its one thing to be absent which was horrific, but to lie about it and make it seem how good he was - thats a whole new level of disgraceful.", "NTA, this sounds like he glossed over reality in an attempt to impress his friends with you. And it sounds like you are where you are in life, and have achieved the successes you have in spite of him, not because of him. So yea, NTA for correcting that. Don't let him take credit for something / someone (you and your success) that he didn't have anything to do with.", "NTA. You were ambushed and he was hoping the presence of the others would make you go easy on him.

You build a wall between the two of you, with out a door.  You slap his hand each time he reaches out,regardless of what fact that (by your own admission) you believe him to now be a good husband and father. If he is recovery from a dependency problem. Then actions such as what you described can lead to a relapse. Yeah, it sucks that he didn\u2019t do right by you when you were younger, but he did get help, and turned things around.\n\nTo clarify:\nI am not saying you are wrong for telling him off.\nBut the error in judgment that you made was to do so in such a public manner. It may not have been your intention when you agreed to meet. But you had opportunity and were self aware enough to excuse your self from the situation prior to blowing up. Your comments weren\u2019t to express your feelings, they were to cause hurt, to inflict damage.  This is why YTA", "YTA. He tried his best to fix his past mistakes. He is not a saint and neither are you. If you are not ready to forgive him, you don't have to meet him. Don't humiliate him in front of his friends. Anyhow, given your behaviour, his friends probably think you are TA anyway", "Notice that he didn't apologize to you or attempt to make amends for being a terrible dad. He centered himself as the wronged party because you told the truth. You deserve better than this.", "But he lied, if he hadnt made it all up then he wouldnt have embarrassed himself. Also it was one thing him lying to his friends - but then to your face he lied and said  \" how excited he was to do all the things with her that he used to do with me.\" Thats re-writing history in a cruel way to you. All he needed to say was I'm sad that I never got to do things with you, but I would love to be part of your life and share experiences with you and your child.\n\nAnd why shouldnt he be ashamed.

I mean, given that he \"brags\" about the op all the time and stuff and never even gave them an inkling that he wasn't all there when OP was actually a kid, he's practically lied by omission. Now OP has gone and peeled the bandaid, and he's worried about how his image of the wonderful man and father will fare.

Nothing can be resolved if he\u2019s still pretending it never happened.\n\nExpecting her to be the bigger person and cover for him in front of others is unfair.", "Nope, he lied and tried to cornered OP to maintain his lie. Op wouldn't show up with she knew about all the lies bio father was saying.", "Yeah, she agreed to meet him not to let him lie about the past to save face. Good for new children he was a good father but for OP he is just a sperm donor.", "He may have genuinely thought differently about your relationship when you were a child. I know my own father had an entirely warped view on ours. What I considered horrific as a child he was of the opinion that he was doing great. He ended up committing suicide after I refused his offer to live with him and expressed how stressed I was with him. He was blindsided and couldn't deal. I also think, as a parent now we can misinterpret situations and underestimate how damaging our behaviour can be to a fragile young thing growing up with stress and trauma. He was a drinker, his mind is not telling him the truth.", "He should have just shut up about it, honestly.

I just wonder if you have the full story.  It seems that you may only have your mom's perspective since they split when you were young.  Also, is it possible that his friends had you confused with your sibling or otherwise confused his word?  I'm not saying you were in the wrong nor am I defending him.  I think that there can be many sides to the story and publicly reacting from hurt and anger usually isn't the way to go.

We haven't spoken since.", "NTA, he went looking for an answer and found one", "It's the fact that he txt you to try and guilt you for it instead of saying \" hey sorry I put you in that situation I didn't exactly want my friends knowing about my past but that is not by any means your responsibility to deal with and I'm especially sorry if this brought back bad times it was not my intent \" idk something that was less about him and more about you so no NTA \n\nComing from someone who's dad is trying to sweep 20 years of inconsistency under the rug by constantly asking do you remember this do you remember when we did that like no dude I don't have happy memories of us together I barely have memories of my childhood at all  I remember you hitting mom, I remember you getting home so drink you'd hit me, I remember the three miscarriages I witnessed , I remember you ignoring and yelling at me for even daring to interrupt your soccer game ,  but i don't fckn remember going to the lake with you I'm 26 now we barely talk but when we do it's awkward af", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't a good dad to you. If he hasn't told his friends the truth then he's living a lie. It's not your fault he dragged you into his delusional life. He should have already told them the truth. He wasn't a father to you when you were growing up & he hasn't been one to you since your mother died.", "NTA. \n\nYou were mistreated by your father in the past. Don't get me wrong, it's great that he cleaned up and became a better father. However, he cannot expect you to not be angry at him for his mistakes in the past, even if you exposed him in front of his friends. Chances are, he's been lying to them.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know how so many adults have no self awareness. It's bewildering really.", "NTA. He shouldn't have brought up the past. Especially how he was. You are a better person than me because I would have straight up cut him from my life a long time ago", "NTA. You had a very different childhood than what he recalls. What did he expect? Were you supposed to just agree?", "NTA. Why on earth would your biological father invite you to a restaurant that his friends frequent knowing your relationship is not on solid ground? He wagered he could get away with pretending he helped make you into the woman you are and he lost!!! Good for you for going no contact. He doesn\u2019t deserve more than you have given.", "NTA. My biofather did the same thing. Met him for the first time since I was 3 and had zero memory. He brought along all his friends without notifying me, and spent years showing off my social media posts and accomplishments as if they\u2019re his own. \n\nI tried to stay amicable-ish. \n\nA few years later, I decided blocking him on every single platform is what\u2019s best for my mental health. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to claim any positive traits of yours for his friends to fawn over when he did zero towards raising you.", "NTA\n\nHe's the one one who brought up the past. And lied about it.", "NTA\n\nI am reminded of one of my favorite songs, \"Don't Tell a Lie About Me, Dear, and I Won't Tell the Truth About You\" . . .", "NTA \n\nYou had every right to say what you said because he\u2019s trying to rewrite the past and act like he was father of the decade to you basically lying to his friends and whoever else.", "NTA. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you were probably going to have that kind of a conversation with him anyway. Not your fault his friends were there to hear it.", "INFO : is he trying to apologize in these texts?\n\nCause for sure you are n-t-a but if you don't communicate, it is sure that the situation won't get any better.\n\nI would give your father a chance to apologize, just to see if he would actually do it, acknowledging his faults and not trying to justify his behavior.\n\nIf doesn't take this chance, then you'll know for sure that he not anything else than a sperm donor.\n\nEither way, you'll have closure.", "If he didn't want to hear the truth he should not have asked. It looks to me, from what you wrote, like you would have not said anything if he didn't ask you what was wrong. If he had ignored the face you made his friends would have heard nothing at all about his past. Did he expect you to lie?\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nPeople usually have short memories when it suits.", "NTA.\n\n\n>...and that I could\u2019ve picked another time to air out our history.\n\nOr he could've not put you on the spot and expected you to play along with an outright lie?

You should have told me! Here's her email address, I'll instruct her to look out for your email after I'm dead and she's an adult, and then a yearly email saying 'happy birthday' that an auto-text could have sent. Enjoy the years in between with your other family as you did while never trying to have a relationship with me. Meanwhile baby and I will go and spend time with my mom's headstone, since she can clearly expect more of a relationship with it than with you. Bye!\"\n\nNTA. Bad enough having a kid you fuck up on raising but to actually be deluded enough to think you can make up a bullshit history in front of them and believe *they should play along with it*?

This is reasonable.", "NTA, what\u2019s worst is that rather than trying to make new good memories he was making up false ones.", "NTA- he doesn\u2019t get to erase his past mistakes and non existent relationship with you as a dad. Sure, he\u2019s cleaned up and being a father that he should have been to you to other kids but he doesn\u2019t get to erase his past. He has to live with his huge mistakes and own up to what he was because it affected you in the biggest of ways.", "I think it wasn\u2019t good timing as he said probably could of had that out in private. I had a similar upbringing and I think what stands out for me is that he has changed and he has repeatedly tried to bring you back into his life. I did have to decide if to keep my dad in my life or not and I decided to have a relationship and that\u2019s what you need to decide \u2014 it\u2019s about forgiving which doesn\u2019t mean forgetting what\u2019s happened \u2014 but really it\u2019s making that choice \u2014 I let go of the horrible things that happened with my mum and half brother and focus on the present and we have a much better relationship as adults", "NTA, just because you made it inconvenient for him to lie about him being a good father to you doesnt make you an AH", "NTA. Your bio dad needed a reality check.", "NTA And it will forever boggle my mind tht people expect to lie and have other people back them up and then get mad when the other people don't do that!", "YTA\n\nYou are still young and I don\u2019t think you have children yourself, so you are still under the guise of \u201cparents are perfect\u201d the truth of the matter is, nobody is perfect and people make mistakes, even parents. Especially parents. Sounds like your father struggled with drug addiction, people don\u2019t do drugs, for no reason who knows what his childhood was like or his struggle looks, I don\u2019t think you ever asked. What I do see, is your father trying, many times, to make amends with you and be a part of your life, but your ego, pride or own personal hurt is stopping that from happening. Life is short, you only have one father and one mother\u2026 You lost your mother. Why don\u2019t you drop all the armor and try to reconnect with your father, who seems to be desperately trying to reconnect with you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but I truly believe you are the asshole here. You are not a child anymore, you have not been for a long time. A lot of people in your position would love to have a father who wants to see them, your father is actively trying to have a relationship with you\u2026 Maybe he isn\u2019t the best at it, but he is trying. You don\u2019t want to have regrets when he dies\u2026 It\u2019s not like he wants nothing to do with you\u2026 That is something you know.", "OP could have kept it to herself.  Not necessary to out him like that to his friends that OP will likely never see again.", "I don\u2019t know why she told him either. I wanted this trip to be about sharing memories of my mom with my daughter, not dealing with my childhood trauma.", "My MIL called my spouse her \"practice child.\"  What she really meant was her scapegoat child, the one that got blamed for everything in her life that she didn't like, the one told to be responsible for things adult couldn't have handled.  \n\nThere is a sub for that.  r/raisedbynarcissists", "No he\u2019s never apologized, at least not directly. He\u2019s said things like \u201cI\u2019m sorry your childhood was difficult\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt abandoned\u201d but never actually owning up to it.", "So I guess you missed the part of OP being married and having a baby last April huh?", "Oh I\u2019m sorry, did she force him to lie to his friends about all the great things he did with her? He could have easily avoided the situation by not trying to make himself look like a great dad. If he\u2019s friends are more disgusted by her correcting his lies than they are by his lies themselves, then they are AH too", "No one is an AH for refusing to participate in someone\u2019s delusional lies and fantasy universe they\u2019ve built for their friends", "That's what I was thinking, like time and a place he seems like he wants to fix the relationship... so on the surface it seems like why did she even go to the lunch?

Yes.  Should have? No. This was the dad\u2019s idea. He was delusional enough to think his estranged daughter would keep her mouth shut about being estranged, to protect his reputation from his own lies and dishonesty about his history\u2026and somehow the burden is on OP to be more gracious about being neglected. \n\nBig fat fuck no on that one.", "If he really turned over a new leaf, then he should have had a discussion with you where he admitted his past mistakes and apologized for them. Instead you got silence *and* the expectation that you would act like everything was fine, for some reason. Speaks to his ego. You did nothing wrong here.", "That\u2019s on him not you! Instead of lying he should\u2019ve been owned his past mistakes but no he tried to paint this picture of himself as a good father when he wasn\u2019t.", "Just because his past is shameful, it doesnt mean he can lie and cover it up", "You are right the dad made her go to the lunch, he then made her say some rude shut. She is responsible for her actions", "Didn\u2019t your momma teach you not to be a liar? Nathan didn\u2019t need to spin the story of \u201cI\u2019m going to do all the things with my granddaughter that I did with my kid.\u201d He should be ashamed of trying to make himself look like something he\u2019s not.", "Yeah, that's definitely not shame he's feeling. It's embarrassment at having been caught.\n\nHim not apologizing proves it.", "There may have been some good times, but not enough for me to remember. My mom never spoke badly of him or anything, she rarely ever mentioned his addiction or any other issues he had, my opinions of him are based on what I remember and what I\u2019ve read in police reports.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect a lot from him when we met up at the restaurant. I feel like the only thing he can really do at this point is just be for my siblings and his wife what he failed to be for me and my mother. At the very least though, I had also hoped that maybe he\u2019d take some accountability for what happened. I know I probably damaged whatever bridge we were building by talking about it publicly, but I honestly would have been just as upset if I found out later in private that he had lied. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been as polite either, because I think it would\u2019ve almost hurt more.", "That\u2019s a whole new sentence and not what I said.\n\nI\u2019m saying that he created the situation by lying to begin with. Had he not lied, she wouldn\u2019t have publicly corrected it. Could she have let it go, yeah, she could have. But it is entirely unreasonable of him to expect to rebuild a relationship with her when he\u2019s painted a falsehood of it to everyone else. \n\nWhen you\u2019re seeking forgiveness for your actions, you own up to them, you don\u2019t sweep them under the rug to other people and then expect the person you harmed to play along.\n\nETA: missing word", "So you are assuming he never created any memories and was total dead beat of what information? I mean we don't know I find it hard to believe there is nothing there but idk, regardless didn't your momma teach you two wrongs don't make a right?", "Wonder how honest he is with his wife and kids, if he's blatantly lying to his friends.", "You said the entire situation exists because of him so i take that ass you blame him for her actions despite from all accounts he is trying to be a better person, and yes I agree with you about rebuilding and being honest, however that's no one's businesses besides there's. I belive there is a time and a place for those talks, this was not one, he clearly wants to rebuild the relationship. Also she doesn't spend time with him, what if his friends knew his past and were open to it and wanted to help him regardless we don't know.  All we know is she didn't have to go to the lunch nor did she have to say what she said. This post is about her and she was rude and an asshole to someone.", "How is it wrong to correct a lie? If I tell you the sky is green it\u2019s wrong for you to tell me it\u2019s blue?", "He chose to father a child, then he chose not to be a father. Then he lied about his involvement in her life to his friends. Then he invited her to eat with him. Then when the friends showed up he continued with the lie.\nShe made the choice to correct him. Was that an action she chose to make? Yes.\nHowever, the action itself would have never been necessary had he not created this situation.\n\nSo yes the entire situation exists because of him, and she\u2019s responded to it by stating the truth. Telling the truth doesn\u2019t make her a bad person or an A H even if he is *trying* to be better.", "Your comment supports my argument of ESH. She wasn\u2019t the better person. She sunk to the level of his bio dad\u2019s past behavior hence\u2026.\n\nHer bio dad otoh seems to have been trying to make amends and she just threw all that down the drain."]}
