We have joint custody, but he is scheduled to take the kids every other weekend and some holidays. He's actually only taken them about 17 nights this year; BUT due to a complicated work/home situation for him and his husband; he has been staying at my house during the week (with me there too) for awhile now. He rarely ever takes the kids on weekends, unless I flat out tell him \"I need a break, can you please take x this weekend?\" Even then it's 50/50 on if he will or not. A popular exuse is \"Well Tim and I need a break, and are going {x place} so I can't\" (For context they live with my ex's mother and she is a nightmare most times.)\n\nCurrently, the kids recieve insurance through the state, because I do not make much. When child support was decided my ex was working a regular job, with insurance, and making like $24 an hour.\n\nNow, he works for an induvidual, doing maintence making maybe $20 an hour. Tim (his husband) does not work right now, because of medical issues.\n\nBefore the divorce was finalized we were seperated and he and Tim were paying support for the kids, no issue. At the time, I told the judge this, so he did not order it to be withheld from his paychecks, since he had proof he was paying me, monthly, directly.\n\nHe has not paid regularly, since. The state became aware of this during out yearly review for their insurance. The state has now taken over in collecting payments. He does not think this is fair, because they are living off just his income now, and he sees the kids a lot, but does not ever take them on his time.\n\nI told him to file for an adjustment, since he makes less, and he still has not done that.\n\nI feel bad, but he still makes more than I do, and I have to pay electric/water/everything except rent where I live. He and Tim have their own bills, but the electric/water/whatever where they live are ALL on his mothers name, I assume they help pay, but I don't know.\n\nHe recently said \"Child support shouldn't matter because the kids have what they need.\" Yeah, cause I work two jobs now.\n\nHe thinks I am an Asshole because I let the state know he wasn't paying anymore, and now they are suing him. What do you think, reddit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - The amount he's ordered to pay is $747 a month, this is for 2 kids.\n\nEdit 2: Info - I think I might be the asshole because I did report him for non payment, this can result in him having his paycheck garnished, or getting his drivers license suspended if he doesn't pay.", "created_utc": 1697136640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176edsn/aita_for_telling_the_state_my_ex_stopped_paying/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could have filed for an adjustment at any time and he didnt.", "NTA. Visitation with the children is a completely different subject from child support.  The ex is an adult, if he needs an adjustment to child support due to wage changes, it's his responsibility to file.  In no way does his life changes make you an AH.

As their parent, he has a responsibility to his children and that responsibility exists regardless of what's going on in his life and if he can't afford that child support on his income, it's his responsibility to contact the court to try and have that adjusted. Don't let him convince you that you're the bad guy when he's the one being a deadbeat.", "NTA. I got 70 dollars a month for two kids.

He needs to pay his share for HIS kids. \n\nSituation now does not matter, he can talk to the court himself.

Lying to the state? Do not feel bad. He can file for an adjustment, or start paying \u2014 it's his choice, and all of his doing. This is out of your control.", "NTA.

It will be adjusted lower since he\u2019s making less but that\u2019s on him to pay. It also isn\u2019t like his family doesn\u2019t help him and his husband might receive disability payments.

The court determined that should be $747 a month based on how much he was earning. \n\nHe isn't paying that, heck, he is crashing with you regularly and eating your food, using your electricity and water, and your home. \n\nSo now you are helping to support HIM!  So why is he mad?  Because he is USING YOU.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a good person, but as the child of someone with a father that made stupid arguments like this and only picked me up for his custody when it was convenient for him too you need to get tougher about things. It doesnt matter if he is the only one working, and it also doesnt matter if the kids have a roof over their head right now. If you're having to work two jobs you are probably living paycheck to paycheck and dont have savings for emergencies, which is important to your kids wellbeing. They are his kids too and he has a legal responsibility to provide for them. When he doesn't pay you are essentially covering his portion which in the eyes of the court means he owes YOU the money. It is very rare for the other parent to ever recover it even with court intervention so it's important to do everything you can to actually get him to pay now. If he's making less he needs to file for the adjustment and the court will determine what a reasonable amount is based on his pay. Since you are also working so much of the time right now, that means your kids are losing out on time with the only stable parental presence in their lives. \n\nHe should not be staying at your house, period, especially when it's his time for custody. He can take them to a park or his own place and that boundary is important, because he is walking all over you and taking advantage of you. Dont feel bad at all because this isn't about you, it's about your kids and making sure they have a healthy and safe environment to grow up in. He's also not doing the kids any favors showing up whenever he feels like it and just staying at your place. It's only going to confuse them and as they get older make them wonder why he doesnt keep his promises.", "NTA. And please stop letting him disrupt your life by living or even staying in your house.", "NTA, at all.  Your kids didn't stop eating, outgrowing their shoes, or needing a place to sleep, just because your ex didn't feel like paying his CS.  You did the right thing, and you have nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA.  He\u2019s a Deadbeat Dad and you feel like you need to ask if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s in the wrong?  I\u2019m sorry that whatever happened in your past has you questioning yourself like that, but please realize that there\u2019s no way to spin this where he\u2019s not 100% in the wrong.
