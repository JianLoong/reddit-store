In the past when I just got married, they made a huge fuss because I wanted to set boundaries with them and my husband i.e. they wanted to tell my husband about all our extended family\u2019s drama and I have always wanted to shield him from it. There were a lot of tears and emotional blackmail involved back then. So I know it will be the same or even worse this time around.

They have lost so many friends through the years because of this trait and they still do not understand why people refuse to answer their calls or aren\u2019t friends with them anymore. \nRegarding not telling them about when I go into labor, my husband has agreed to this so I have some hope of them not demanding to be let into the labor room. But he has said he will have to inform them once the child is born and I know they will want to visit then. Well atleast it wont be when I\u2019m in the OT.", "Yup.

I\u2019m trying to but it\u2019s a little difficult convincing him.
