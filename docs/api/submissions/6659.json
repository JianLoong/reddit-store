Instead of selling my old house, I decided to rent it out instead.  My current tenants have been there for about 18-months and for the most part I haven't had any problems with them.  We recently had a large snowstorm in our area, about 20-inches in a 3-day period.  As part of the rental agreement, I pay a plow service to clear the driveway and parking area of my rental property after large storms.  Other times I just go over there with my own snowblower and take care of it. \n\nI ask my tenants to move their cars out of the parking area and driveway so that the plow truck can maneuver properly and move the snow safely.  My tenants are a family and they have 3-4 cars depending on if their oldest is staying with them or not (She is in college nearby and sometimes stays at home instead of at school).  \n\nI always give 48-hour notice when I schedule the plow truck to come so that my tenants have ample notice and time to move their cars.  I sent an email to them notifying them of the date and time that the plow truck was scheduled to be at the house, but I got no reply.  So I sent a text, but also got no response.  I tried calling but got no answer so I left a message, but didn't hear back.\n\nThe day the plow truck was scheduled, I got a call from the driver saying that he can't plow the snow because there are too many cars in the way.  I went over there and there were 5 cars, 2 of which I didn't recognize.  The driver said he had knocked on the door but no one answered.  I tried too, but no one was home.  I tried calling again but no answer.  I eventually had to tell the driver to leave because he had other jobs to get to.  \n\nI sent another email saying that they have 24-hours to move their vehicles or they will be towed so the snow can be removed.  I got no response to that email either.  The next day I went to the house again and tried calling one last time, but no answer.  So, I called a tow truck and had all 5 cars towed and got the plow truck to clear the snow.  \n\nThe next day I finally got a call back from my tenant.  He said they were out of state visiting family for the holidays and didn't have cell service or internet access.  He asked if I could wait on removing the snow until they get back in a couple days.  I had to tell him that their cars had already been towed.  \n\nHe was not happy.  There was a string of expletives about how I had no right to tow their cars and that 2 of the cars were family members who were traveling with them.  I advised him to reread the rental agreement regarding parking and snow removal because I was completely within my rights to remove cars after giving proper advance notice.  \n\nHe let loose with a string of expletives that would make a sailor blush and threatened to sue me for damages.

Our and most I've lived in include common areas such as sidewalk, fire hydrant, and curb if on a corner, not a personal driveway.

Where you expected them to shovel their way and then come with your plow?\n\nBecause if it requires a snowplow it means there was a massive amount of snow in the driveway.\nMore over did you really need a snowplow after the car was towed? Again IMO there was no snow left in the driveway after. 5 cars will not have snow under! \n\nDid you really expect people to be home during Christmas? I don't know if the law is the same from what I know, but I think their non response doesn't allow you to tow their car and they could be refunded in civil court. And honestly I expect they sue your ass! \n\nDon't you read all the bullshit some landlord go through? Can't you be happy you have good and reliable tenant that makes no problem?!!!!

Just because you mean to tell me you couldn\u2019t find a compromise to keep you safe during the time they were out of town. But also giving them the leeway of getting home to deal with the issue.

So maybe that's why the OP got the plough in and didn't shovel it or a snow blower.\n\nDoing a little investigating, the OP confirmed that it differed from the few inches we got in London in mid-December. Instead, it was a proper snowstorm. OP stated, \"The drifts at the end of the driveway were almost chest high and already rock solid with huge chunks of frozen slush. It needed a plow.' OP further states, \"We got 20-inches of snow. The city plows had already created huge drifts at the entrance to the driveway.

In fact, one person said their city takes the snow away, so it doesn't melt and refreeze or melt and cause flooding.\n\nSome cities have ordinances in place for this. Some even say that pathways and driveways must be cleared. OP confirmed this.\n\nBut the OP wasn't worried about the fine from the city; it was about liability. \"\u2026if someone gets injured on the driveway or sidewalk due to my failure to remove the snow, I am liable as the homeowner. Our city ordinance is 24-hours after the snow stops. So if the mailman or a delivery driver slips because I didn't remove the snow, I'm getting sued, not my tenant.\"\n\nWhy not just plough the pathway and leave the driveway? Again, I refer you back to the first quote from the OP, chest-high drifts blocking the driveway. So he definitely needed a professional with a proper snow plough.\n\nI'm going to go for NTA.

Bare mins they should have had someone- if/why not the landlord checking for that and the parking/snow could have been handled w advance notice. Maybe it slipped their minds getting ready for vacay but this could have been avoided had the tenants planned ahead.", "It was his own driveway, part of it anyway. I don\u2019t believe the city would have a mandate about a private driveway", "Common sense tells me there is no way in hell I want my landlord to know I'm away.", "As a homeowner in WA, the only thing the city mandates we clear is the public sidewalk. We always clear a bath and salt the walkway to our mailbox as well. I have never seen someone fined for it though. I am wondering if the home is part of a homeowner's association? They can have much stricter rules.", "So, speaking as a landlord, the reason is that if something like a plumbing leak happens during an extended absence, it could literally cause tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. If you\u2019re there, you notice it in a day or two and fix the problem for a few hundred bucks. Vacant homes/apartments are targets for break-ins and vandalism.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t a few unscrupulous landlords who would take advantage of knowing their tenants are out of town, but there are legitimate reasons for wanting to know about extended absences.\n\nPersonally, I couldn\u2019t care less about the travel habits of my tenants beyond wanting to make sure that the property is secure.", " I think you are right the only mandate here is clear sidewalks. They sent out a pamphlet late fall about the plowing schedule +map w the city (spokane) water bill and I think they just plow you in if you don't move lol this winter has been so snowy!! Last couple years I feel like it didn't snow until freaking January!! Now we own a house and it is has been a lot of shoveling.\n\nIt would make sense if it was hoa rules or maybe just a very strict winter intense region. With the news about winters in the Eastern US I would not be surprised if new and improved rules are being made s power outages and all the snow and ice.", "I\u2019ve rented in IN. Never saw this there either.", "I\u2019ve seen this in Canadian leases. Some house insurance companies require the house to be checked on every 7, sometimes 10 days, if people are going to be away. So the requirement to have the landlord notified is so that they can pop by to abide by the insurance policy."]}
