Instead of selling my old house, I decided to rent it out instead.  My current tenants have been there for about 18-months and for the most part I haven't had any problems with them.  We recently had a large snowstorm in our area, about 20-inches in a 3-day period.  As part of the rental agreement, I pay a plow service to clear the driveway and parking area of my rental property after large storms.  Other times I just go over there with my own snowblower and take care of it. \n\nI ask my tenants to move their cars out of the parking area and driveway so that the plow truck can maneuver properly and move the snow safely.  My tenants are a family and they have 3-4 cars depending on if their oldest is staying with them or not (She is in college nearby and sometimes stays at home instead of at school).  \n\nI always give 48-hour notice when I schedule the plow truck to come so that my tenants have ample notice and time to move their cars.  I sent an email to them notifying them of the date and time that the plow truck was scheduled to be at the house, but I got no reply.  So I sent a text, but also got no response.  I tried calling but got no answer so I left a message, but didn't hear back.\n\nThe day the plow truck was scheduled, I got a call from the driver saying that he can't plow the snow because there are too many cars in the way.  I went over there and there were 5 cars, 2 of which I didn't recognize.  The driver said he had knocked on the door but no one answered.  I tried too, but no one was home.  I tried calling again but no answer.  I eventually had to tell the driver to leave because he had other jobs to get to.  \n\nI sent another email saying that they have 24-hours to move their vehicles or they will be towed so the snow can be removed.  I got no response to that email either.  The next day I went to the house again and tried calling one last time, but no answer.  So, I called a tow truck and had all 5 cars towed and got the plow truck to clear the snow.  \n\nThe next day I finally got a call back from my tenant.  He said they were out of state visiting family for the holidays and didn't have cell service or internet access.  He asked if I could wait on removing the snow until they get back in a couple days.  I had to tell him that their cars had already been towed.  \n\nHe was not happy.  There was a string of expletives about how I had no right to tow their cars and that 2 of the cars were family members who were traveling with them.  I advised him to reread the rental agreement regarding parking and snow removal because I was completely within my rights to remove cars after giving proper advance notice.  \n\nHe let loose with a string of expletives that would make a sailor blush and threatened to sue me for damages.

Other times I just go over there with my own snowblower and take care of it.\n\nPer the first comment the city is concerned about pedestrians and mail/parcel carriers sustaining injury on sidewalks and driveways.

You had the means to make a serviceable and legal pathway by using a shovel and your snowblower or hired someone with a shovel/snowblower to make a serviceable walkway both on the drive way and the sidewalk without having the cars removed. \n\nYou chose the most harmful route for your long term renters rather than taking a reasonable alternative costing them hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars depending on the tow companies tow cost plus storage fees for each vehicle.

My guy wouldnt refund the fee I paid and Id agree with him.", "Getting cars towed costs money too, so he threw good money after bad money just to make a point and that's where it becomes spiteful and continues to make him TA.\n\nThe plow guys come with the ability to hand shovel smaller areas, the whole thing was just the OP going nuclear because he thinks 48 hours notice is reasonable during holidays. Legal requirement maybe, but not reasonable.", "My point was more \"He admits to snowblowing personally sometimes, therefore it's not unreasonable to believe he could also just shovel a simple path to cover his obligations instead of spending extra money to get a tow truck out during the holiday, after a snowstorm\" which definitely cost him a pretty penny.", "You actually didn't answer my question at all, just started fantasizing about what you would do instead.\n\nYou said:\n\n> Lets just make the job take twice as long and have to visit the property twice for the needed work.\n\nimplying that you believe it takes \"twice as long\" for OP to pick up a shovel and clear a path as it did for him to arrange for a tow truck to remove five entire cars from a snowed in property.\n\nLet's be serious here. It does not take twice as long. OP could have easily solved this problem with a little elbow grease and a warning to his tenants. Instead he went with the nuclear option.", ">Getting cars towed costs money too, so he threw good money after bad money just to make a point and that's where it becomes spiteful and continues to make him TA.\n\nTowing companies don't take money up front.  They take money when the car is picked up by the owner of the vehicle.  I didn't pay the tow company anything.", "The tenants pay the towing fees if they want their vehicles back.\n\nMy plow guy does an average of 10-20 driveways and some parking lots.  He is up for hours and barely sleeps.  Most plow guys are not shoveling.  Mine wouldnt. He moves snow with his vehicle then salts it, with his vehicle.  He never leaves his truck.  My plow guy would do the exact same thing, he would leave and let me know he couldnt do the job", "Shoveling 20 inches of snow?!", "You're still ignoring the fact the low guy was paid and contracted to do the job and couldnt because of blocking vehicles.  That works needs to be done or else thats wasted $ out of OP's pocket.\n\nMy point still stands about the plow guy is not going to clear around vehicles or just shovel a path.  He will still have to come back to finish the job.  He is not going to do double or extra work."]}
