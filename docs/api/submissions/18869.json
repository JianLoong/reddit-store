OP's parents have jobs already and seem to be forgetting that owning a business requires some level of involvement in it.\n\nIt's incredibly foolish to believe you can work a full time job and run a business on top of that. There's not enough hours in the day for that.\n\nIt's not like you just set up a store and then BOOM you're rolling in money and there's never anything that happens in the business that would need the owner's attention.
