Even if he's the one bringing in the income, it's not only his money. It doesn't work that way, especially when you have children. Your labor and contributions to the home and to the upbringing of the child are just as equal and important as his ability to earn money.

Someone would still have to care for the home, which should be both of you if you two are both \"providing\" income. \n\nThe fact that you are asking if you are the AH for not asking for the debit card means that your normal meter is so off that I would bet there is a fair bit of mental and emotional abuse taking place.

She's literally asking am I the aita for not trying harder and making excuses meaning his actions have her questioning her own powers of reasoning and judgement which is what gaslighting does.

She's not asking if she's the asshole for being upset at his actions or for overacting in her response or for being hurt by his actions. She's specifically asking if she's the asshole for making excuses and not trying to get his attention harder.
