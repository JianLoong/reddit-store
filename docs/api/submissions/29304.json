So every other week or so I like to take the weekend to go camping on my own cause there are some pretty great views to see where we live. So I usually head out around Saturday morning and drive a few hours out to a campsite and spend the night camping and ride my dirt-bike down some trails the next day and come back home around 5-6 the next day.\n\n  \nSo this weekend I was packing my bags to head out for Saturday and my girlfriend asked me what do you even do all the way out there. I told her what I do and she went \" That cant be all you do that seems so boring dont you go to a restaurant or something\". I told her nah thats really all I do when I head out and she didn't believe me so she wanted to tag along with me on this weekends trip.\n\n  \ni told her that I didn't want her to come with me since i know she wont enjoy herself and be miserable and also cause i like it cause it lets me disconnect and bringing people along with me kinda defeats the purpose. She got sad since she assumed that I was only doing it s=so taht i could spend time away from her which isnt true and refuses to believe me now.", "created_utc": 1697808011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cb4pp/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_dont_want_her_to/", "score": 1003, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bring her along for one trip. Tell her ahead of time that she can come with you, but you're not going to change your routine at all and show her your standard camping trip. Do exactly what you usually do regardless of if she complains and wants to do something else. If she complains, explain that you understand this is not what she enjoys, but you love it very much. You're not asking her to change her life to suit your ways, but she needs to be understanding of your hobbies and interests.\n\nNta as long as you turn this into a learning experience for her.", "Nah, I think if you focus on the fact you *think* she won't have fun on your camping trip, you're not having the right conversation. \n\nEvery second weekend is quite a lot.  It sounds like she's more upset at the lack of time together than anything else.   And the message I hear when you say \"Don't come you won't be happy\" is \"you're going to ruin it, I don't want to spend time with you *ever*\". When that's what the other person is hearing, its not much of stretch for that thought to go to 'This is about me not wanting you rather than what you'll be content with, and I would rather have you be miserable than compromise'. \n\nAnd I'm sure that's not the message you want to send. Or I hope its not - the fact you have asked this forum [twice already](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c7uce/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_dont_want_her_to/) because you didn't like when people pointed that out before is not a good sign. But when you're focused on trying to be 'right', you're not changing the message that people are hearing.", "NAH but you might not be compatible. I'd honestly be pretty upset if my husband went away every other weekend and didn't want me to come. You're not an asshole for wanting to spend time alone, but the amount seems excessive for someone in a relationship.", "Look at it from her perspective, she only sees you ever other weekend, and then when she offers to go with you so you can still be together, she gets told you would rather go alone. That\u2019s going to sound like you just don\u2019t want to spend time with her. \n\nI understand you want to take time just for you, but you are in a relationship now and you should also be as protective and proactive at carving out time for \u2018us\u2019. She needs to also feel like a priority in your life and you might have to compromise a little if she is important to you", "I know a lot of people who enjoy camping/hiking/etc. out in nature by themselves. Often these are introverted people who need time to recharge spending time on their own. That being said, your gf is trying to understand more about you and your interests. In this day and age, that\u2019s hard to come by, lol. This is an opportunity to connect on something you love, or recognize this is something  that might end up being a dealbreaker. If she\u2019s willing to try, she might find the importance of nature and the need to maintain and respect our environment. If I were you, I would plan a trip with her at a time that works for you, even if it is not the next trip. Do something easy, as that can help you both focus on enjoying it. If you plan biking on your own, let her know to bring a book, knitting, or something she enjoys doing while you\u2019re gone. The more we understand our partner, the more successful our relationships can be. Sometimes however, this can also show that people are a mismatched fit. (Btw, if you never bring her, she will always wonder why and the mind is often more dangerous than reality.)", "That's kinda YTA to yourself and to her. \n\nTo her: it sounds like she genuinely wants to spend time with you. She only sees you every other weekend due to a *hobby* rather than a job. An awful lot of people wouldn't tolerate that. Instead of saying \"no, I don't want you there\", why not make clear that if she comes you're not going to change what you do there?\n\nTo yourself: you're pushing your girlfriend away.", "YTA\n\nYou go regularly, what's the harm bringing her for one trip? If she doesn't like it, she'll leave you to it. If she does, well you've just unlocked a cool new hobby for your partner, and it's something you can share together.\n\nYou can still take alone trips if that's important to you, by agreeing when and where. But deciding for your girlfriend that she won't like it and stopping her from joining you is a bit of a dick move. Let her figure that out for herself.", "YTA.  You\u2019re going away every other weekend?  Do you even like your gf?", "YTA\n\nyou go every other weekend by yourself?\n\nand you wonder why your gf questions what you are doing?\n\nit sounds like you have a whole other life that she is not involved in and while you probably dont have a side chick, taking your gf out once and showing her what you do could make this all be benign in her mind.\n\nshe is a homebody you said, have her bring stuff to occupy her while you do your rides and make sure she packs food that she can eat as you have told her you dont go out to eat", "YTA - out of 52 weekends -26 of them you aren\u2019t home. How would you feel if the situation was reversed. Spend more time at home or take her with you if you value your relationship.", "Think about it this way.  You are gone every other weekend, why so often?  I completely agree to alone time, it's important.  My boyfriend and mine's alone time is him going to the gym or me hanging out on the farm.  It's not for anything over night and usually not all day either.  \n\nDo you even like this person?  Because it sounds like you have her out of convenience when you want her, and you do your own thing the rest of the time.  I get she hates camping.  Maybe go camping one weekend a month and use the other weekend to do something she likes together.  Unless you aren't really that into her.  YTA", "I would let her come once and be miserable so she doesn\u2019t think anything is going on and she never asks to go again lol", "YTA for not being able to read between the lines. She doesn't believe you which is not your fault but you are putting your relationship at real risk she thinks you are up to something fishy. You should let her come if she wants but still do your routine. If you take your dirtbike out for 2 hour rips tell her you are going for a rip and wont be back for a while and let her sit at camp doing whatever she wants. If in future she gets bored of that she won't come but you need to have open trip policy so she knows at any time she could last minute say she is coming and not think you are driving to the next city to go stay at your other girlfriends house. I know a lot of people will say bla bla trust bla bla trust well this is 2023 we all know that is a load of horse shit and lots of people have zero problems cheating and ya hopefully you can find that person you do trust unconditionally but she is obviously not at that spot with you so make her feel that way. To do that she can at any time come or give her your location and she can at any time show up and you will be there.", "YTA for not giving her a chance. You\u2019ve told her what you do, so give her an option to try. Reiterate that you go to decompress. She is welcome to come but needs to be ready for sitting outside and everything and you aren\u2019t willing to cut the trip short if she hates it. If she goes and doesn\u2019t like it no worries, she doesn\u2019t hasn\u2019t to come again. If she complains the whole time the she is the A.H and needs to apologize and not bother you about camping in the future", "NTA. I\u2019m so confused by these comments. Twice a month for ONE night is not a crazy amount. What is wrong with personal time? It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love his GF if he wants to do his own thing. Sure it would be nice to take her, but he shouldn\u2019t have to. The fact that she can\u2019t understand personal time and makes it about herself might mean they\u2019re incompatible.", "YTA. Set expectations and bring her on one trip. Make a concession or two to your normal routine (ie, if she wants to watch one movie, do it with her! If she wants to bring the whole series of Dexter, leave her to her own [electronic, hehe] devices. Bring a boardgame or similar activity that you guys normally enjoy together)\n\nIf she enjoys herself, maybe see if there's a good rhythm for you guys. Like every 4th trip or something she could tag along", "YTA because you won't let her come with you even one time to check it out.", "NTA, my boyfriend loves camping, I do not. Boyfriend goes camping, I do whatever I feel like doing, we are both happy to have a weekend without each other. A relationship doesn't mean doing everything together.", "I think good, solid relationships should have time spent away from the partner/spouse. I've been with my wife for 20+ years and we definitely do not do everything together. I have my hobbies and she has her hobbies. \n\nThat said, I do think you should've brought her along so she can at least see what you do...and heck maybe she might be into some of the things.  I mean, just because you both go, again doesn't mean you have to spend every minute together...maybe while you're off on your bike, she can stay at the campsite and read or maybe she can take a short hike?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Mild YTA. Let her try it at least once. It's ok to do your own thing and have your own hobby but I do have to say that camping once a fortnight does seem a lot!", "NAH. You aren't a bad guy for wanting to be alone. She isn't a bad guy for wanting to spend some time with you. \n\nSome advice though: relationships involve compromise. If you guys can't compromise with each other as well as not understanding each others boundaries, then you will struggle. Bring her along for a trip dude! If she brings you down, then maybe she isn't for you. If she loves it then you have found a new way to connect with your girlfriend! You go every other weekend, what is there to lose?", "NAH  She just wants to understand you. Maybe if you explain to her that you don't understand why she does some of the things she does but you love her just the same it would help. I have yet to understand why my husband finds cutting the lawn or ironing clothes to be relaxing. He still doesn't understand why I get a kick out of making bread and we've been married for 37 years. Sometimes partners just don't get why the other person does the things they do and that's okay. In fact, it's more than okay it's totally normal.", "Soft NTA - taking her just this once shouldnt be an issue if its a regular thing - by all means make sure that she understands that the solitary experience is an important part so you wont be taking her every time.", "Try camping with her, but arrange to arrive in separate cars so she can leave if she gets bored or uncomfortable.\n\nBecause if she wants to go in spite of not liking outdoor activities, she may just want to spend more time with you, or she may be wondering if you're seeing another girl when you're away for the weekends.  If the latter is at all correct, seeing you actually camping and hiking would set her mind at ease.", "NTA. Going to go against the grain here.  Sounds like they live together and see each other quite often.  I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting time apart, to recharge or whatever.  She also does not like the outdoors, she will not enjoy herself and will probably just make you miserable, I don't think we need to test that out.  You're not even gone for that long, maybe make plans to hang out with her when you get back on Sunday.", "NTA, thats your moment and she isnt doing it to have a time with you, she just want to see if it true what you said.", "Does she really only want to go because she doesn't believe you when you tell her what you do?", "I mean, she's right.  You're doing it to disconnect, so while it's not personal, you absolutely are \"doing it so you can spend time away from \\[her\\]\".\n\nHowever, what I think you meant is that you're not really aligned.  If you need to be away from everyone, which includes her, for 50% of the downtime that's available, every single month, and your SO isn't into that, it's going to be a rough relationship.\n\nETA: NAH, you just don't share hobbies.", "NTA, your reasoning is sound. But bringing her along once won't hurt. Maybe she is missing you on weekends.. She may like it. Or is that the fear? If you are really trying to get away from her and doing this , YTA.", "Clearly not compatible. I wouldn't put up with my partner heading out twice a month and refusing to include me, maybe compromise somehow.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be in a relationship if you don\u2019t actually want to be in a relationship.", "Every other week is excessive, imo. Especially when she\u2019s willing to go and you don\u2019t want her to.\n\nYTA", "Lol your girl was probably slightly suspicious and wondering if you're lying and your reaction was to be like \"babe no way you're coming with me. Im going there ALONE.\" Could have taken her with you and tried to make it a fun thing you do as a couple sometimes but instead opted for making her feel even more insecure. YTA in my opinion for not even trying to include her.", "Light YTA.\n\nJust take her on one trip to show her what it's all about. Show her what you like about camping, why all these things which are insignificant to her are significant to you. Does she have to come every time? No. And if she can't respect your desire to spend a bit of time to yourself, then maybe she's not for you. But I think you have to at least take her on one trip. If not, then suspicion will arise and that will cause more problems that one trip with her could probably avoid. Are you a massive AH? no. But I feel like if someone did this to me then I think I would probably feel similar to how your girlfriend feels.", "NTA, all she would do is complain, and just wait until she\u2019s gotta shit in the woods, she will lose her mind. i would be thrilled if my husband went camping every other weekend. i\u2019d have a blast at home alone with the dogs, spotify, and a lot of wine and weed.", "YTA\n\nShe asked to go with you one time. Just once. But you couldn\u2019t deal with considering her request because it would disrupt your one time away camping. That\u2019s selfish.", "Info why don't you try and plan a weekend of friendlier camping with her? A one time thing or a couple of times per year and you get to have the rest of the camping weekends for you. It might be worth a try.", "First of all, it kinda is true: you are doing it to spend time away from her, just not JUST HER.\n\nI'd also get her wanting to check out the things you like, but this is not the case. She wants to go because she doesn't believe you, not because she thinks it sounds fun. So NTA on not wanting her there.\n\nHowever, i do get her being frustrated that you choose to spend every other weekend away from her. That's a lot of your free time with yourself and not her. Maybe you appreciate your alone time, but she doesn't. It's not very compatible.", "By refusing you set off alarms with her. Take her with you once, who knows she just may enjoy it. You caused some unneeded drama here.", "NAH, but I think both of you need a change in perspective.  A very cool part of relationships is sharing hobbies and interests. \n\nI never liked videogames, but my bf downloaded some easy games so we can play together and I really enjoyed it. Likewise, I taught him how to sew and he had a blast. \n\nOf course it's fine to want to have some hobbies and time for yourself, but if your gf wants to go once, it could be cool to try. She doesn't have to go every time, but let her be a part of your life.\n\nAlso, you could adapt your weekend into something she would enjoy as well. Maybe plan a cool romantic camping meal she would like? \n\nBoth of you need to be able to adapt and be willing to approach it as something potentially fun. If you make no effort to introduce her to your life, or if she complains the whole time, you'll both be miserable. \n\nRemember joy is not a finite resource.", "I think YWBTA if you don't take her.  Let her see what you do or don't do, and if she doesn't like it, which is likely, she will probably not ask to go with you again.  I like to do solo camping a few times a year, and people also look at me weird and ask what I do all alone in the Desert/Mountains.  Luckily my wife enjoys occasional camping, so she knows I really do what I say I do.", "NAH but you did quite literally tell her that you do this to spend time away from her \" I like it cause it lets me disconnect and bringing people along with me kinda defeats the purpose\". There is no other way to take this sentence.", "Every other week? So you\u2019re skipping every other Saturday night? Are you doing date nights on Friday? Are you spending time with her that\u2019s actively dating? I think she may just be telling you she\u2019d like more time together instead of you leaving her alone every other weekend. That\u2019s a lot of time gone.", "YTA. So your girlfriend shares an every-other weekend visitation schedule with nature, and instead of complaining or trying to demand that you stop spending half your free time away from her, she nicely asks to sacrifice her comfort (as you said she doesn't like outdoor activities) in order to spend time with you.... and you were like \"lol, nah!\" \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Dude, do you even like her?? Do you just want to be single? I think you should decide whether you value or her or want to let her go, because keeping her for when you don't have better plans ain't it.", "INFO: why are you with someone you repeatedly say you want time away from?", "NAH\n\nBut you are not compatible. You don't seem to like her very much.", "NAH - I think it's reasonable for you to take time every other weekend to decompress. If you were leaving her alone every single weekend I might feel differently. I also think it's reasonable for her to be curious and want to try going with you. \n\nI don't think springing it on you at the last second is the best way to handle it though. Ideally, I think she would have asked at least a few days ahead of time so you'd be expecting it and you'd actually have time to plan for how it could be enjoyable for both of you.\n\nIf she really wants to go, I'd offer to let her come with you the next time. Make an honest effort for it to be enjoyable for both of you. It might actually be something you both enjoy, or you might be right that she hates it and doesn't ask again.", "NTA. And even if you were spending some time away from her, this is nothing to take offence to. It is healthy to want to spend time alone no matter how much you love your partner and the other person should be understanding of it. Hopefully, she has some plans of her own too where she gets to spend time alone.", "NTA. Your trips also give you a break from talking, which you may not have considered as a side benefit you're getting. The opportunity for silence is what attracts some to silent retreats. Ask her if she would be cool with no talking.", "NTA\nYou are valuing the solo time, and that's reasonable.\n\nBut if she's expressing interest, pick a weekend when you can afford to cut it short, and let her come find out!\nRemind her to plan some quiet solo activities.... Bring a book, plan to go look for interesting plants/animals, sketch/paint or do some nature photography.\n\nIf she's miserable she won't do it again, but what happens if it turns out she loves it? And suddenly, if it's together, you can take longer trips.\n\nMaybe she wants to catch fish and make camp dinner while you're out riding.\n\nOr maybe she will say \"I *do not get it*, but thank you for not dragging me along.\"\n\n(Not instead of your solo retreats, but ALSO.)", "Have he bring her own car so she can leave when she wants to.", "YTA let her come for a trip or two. You do it so often what is the harm? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f prove to her this is what you do, maybe she\u2019ll actually love it or she\u2019ll hate it and not wish to go again.

And once she expresses her desire to tag along, you shoot her down?\n\nIDK - I feel like in a relationship you need to give and take. Let her come once.

Why are y\u2019all even together? Does spending only every other weekend together sound sustainable long term to you?", "Man, you're not a good bf. Unless you just really want this to be your alone time, you played this so wrong.\n\nWorst case scenario is she doesn't have a good time and you've \"wasted a weekend\" trying to accommodate her. In this case, she won't ask to come along again.\n\nBest case scenario, you preemptively anticipate what might make the experience comfortable for her, she has a great time and you two find a new activity you can do together.\n\nThere are many possible outcomes between those extremes.\n\nWhy is it so hard to just give it a chance with her?", "YTA. You go every other weekend. Spend some time with your girlfriend here and there. Bring her along once, she\u2019ll hate it and won\u2019t ask again.", "NAH necessarily.

I would LOVE it if you could  share it with me, but I\u2019m afraid that if I take you with me you won\u2019t make the effort to find the joy in the outdoors.  Do you want to try it, with the understanding that it\u2019s a time to reconnect with nature and disconnect from the modern life?  \u201c\n\nTake her with you.\n\nAs an outdoorsy person, I have no idea how you think you\u2019re going to share your life long term with someone who doesn\u2019t love it to some degree with you.  If you\u2019re going to have kids do you expect to never take them camping or were you going to take them without her?\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou are doing it to get away from her. Not just her but she is some of what you are getting away from. The thing is that's fine. People need time to themselves some more than others. \n\nTo be honest I would be more worried that she suspects your doing something unscrupulous, and that was why she wanted to come with. Telling her you want to go anyway will likely not help suspicions if she has any.", "Nta. It's essential to a healthy relationship to be able to have different tastes and not force others to conform", "YTA\n\nYou go away every other weekend, for starters. \nAlso, the normal reaction in these situations would be to come up with an easy hike she can enjoy or that might at least not be completely miserable for her. Shorter, easier. \nIt seems like you are too self cantered and don\u2019t even like your girlfriend tbh, since the thought didn\u2019t even cross your mind \nAnd that\u2019s what sane couples do. They try to compromise and make it work and then, if it fails, discuss how to split their time together and their alone time. They don\u2019t make unilateral decisions). \n\nYou saying you want to disconnect and she would come in the way of that is just the cherry on top. You lack the emotional maturity to discuss boundaries for alone time. Couples can do their own things next to each other or separately, but at least they should AGREE to it. \n\nIn what would would your treatment of your girlfriend and the explanation ma you gave for not wanting her there wouldn\u2019t make her feel awful? For crying out loud, people usually put on their best fa\u00e7ade on AITA and the best you could come up with was \u201cshe\u2019s a homebody\u201d, \u201cI told e I didn\u2019t want her to come with me\u201d \u201cshe won\u2019t enjoy herself and will be miserable\u201d basically told her having her there would defeat the purpose (=she\u2019d ruin the fun). Not even trying to sugar coat it, are you?\n\nHas it even crossed your mind that maybe she wants to put an effort? Or maybe she doesn\u2019t trust you and things you\u2019re doing /other/ things behind her back?\n\n\u201cShe assumed that I was only doing it so that I could spend time away from her\u201d why wouldn\u2019t she think that? You gave two reasons for why you don\u2019t want her and they boils down to \u201cshe\u2019d be miserable/whiny\u201d and \u201cI want to be alone\u201d. So yeah, it might not be the ONLY reason but it\u2019s a pretty big one. \n\nAgain, it doesn\u2019t sound like you hold them in high regard. Either grow up and start communicating better or set her free.\n\nETA: saw you posted it once already and deleted it and the only info you provided was \u201cwe already went camping once and she didn\u2019t like it. She said it was probably just a bad experience and wanted to try again but I know she\u2019ll hate it. \n1. Stop making decisions for her. \n2. You\u2019re leaving out a lot since you apparently had more than one talk about it. \n3. The \u201cthat can\u2019t be everything you do, surely you go to a restaurant\u201d suddenly makes a lot less sense, since you said you already went camping once. So what is it? Is your gf suffering from memory loss? Or are you just incapable of having an adult discussion and sharing your feelings?", "i mean, she kinda is right that you are doing the camping to spend time away from her- you did say you enjoy camping because it allows you to disconnect from everything and from people. So she isnt entirely wrong.\n\nBut also, she wants to tag along. shes interested in seeing what you do. She also might be low key concerned that all your free time is being spent with someone that ISNT her.\n\nIts sweet that you dont want her to come because of wanting her to not be miserable but honestly, this is something she's going to have to learn the hard way. If she truly doesnt enjoy it, she wont ever ask to come with you again. Just let her go this one time to see what it is you do. And if she does end up enjoying herself, then you have a new nature buddy. And if she hates it, she'll never ask to go with you again. Either way, you win in the long run.\n\nmy verdict: NTA, but neither is she. But you might wanna reconsider and just let her join you this time.", "NTA. It's very healthy for couples to spend time apart as well as together. I used to do monthly solo camping trips, and my husband was always super supportive. It gave each of us time alone. \n\nI think the bigger issue here is that she doesn't believe you when you tell her what you're doing out there.", "YTA.\n\nStop trying to decide for her what she likes and doesn't like. Yes, you're probably right, but by preemptively deciding for her, you're not giving her the opportunity to learn or try something new. For all you know, it might end up being something she discovers she actually likes. Preparing ahead of time for a two person trip, being clear up front what the plan is, being clear up front that the plan will not change, and letting her tag along one time won't kill you.

Not that there's anything *wrong* with that, but I'm surprised *you're* surprised that she's upset by it. \n\nHowever, since it's only every other weekend (according to your post, depending on what that \"or so\" really means), I don't think that's *too* many weekends to spend on your own. Others may disagree, which is why AITA isn't supposed to judge relationships. And if your girlfriend is the type that wants to spend all of her weekends with her boyfriend, don't be surprised if you're replaced. \n\nWhy not add an extra \"girlfriend\" camping trip to the roster? That is, you still camp by yourself every other weekend, but instead of spending the other weekends at home with her, only spend one at home with her, and the *other* other weekend, you take her camping. I expect she'll get bored and want to go back to the original arrangement.", "Nta - as someone who also hates camping, I do see what some people get out of it, so hey. More power to you.", "NTA, I'm 100% down for people doing things apart but every other weekend is a lot of weekends for her not to see you (50% of them!).  She probably just wants to spend quality time with you.  Especially if you both work full time, weekends aren't the same as the few hours after work.  Why not let her come and see if she enjoys it?  You never know, you two might have a really nice time together.\n\nMaybe say something like \"I genuinely thought you wouldn't have a good time, but okay let's give it a shot!\"  Try and turn it into something fun to do together.

This biweekly trip is your me time. \n\nShe isn\u2019t trying to join your trips to see if she\u2019ll enjoy camping (since she said it sounds boring) and if she does then it\u2019s something that you guys can bond and enjoy together. \n\nBut her intentions are not so that at all. Her international are to fact check that you actually do the things you do on your trips and see proof that you actually enjoy camping. She can\u2019t comprehend or believe that you or other people actually enjoy the outdoors. \n\nAlso she is assumption that you want time away from her specifically is wrong. You want time away from everything (her, family, work, city/suburb, etc.) \n\nI suggest trying to talk to her one more time before your trip and say something like, \u201cThe reason I have these trips are not about or associate with you in anyway specifically. I take these trips to have me time (compare it to her me time activity/routine). Also, I don\u2019t appreciate you discrediting and wanting proof of my enjoyment for the outdoors because you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s enjoyable. I don\u2019t want to go camping with someone who is going to question and analyze everything and complain about how much camping is boring.\u201d\n\nMaybe you need to reevaluate this relationship because her fact checking that you actually like your hobbies and activities shows that she doesn\u2019t believe you and only thinks that her values/idea of enjoyment are only right.", "NTA.

Time to decompress and get yourself together without being surrounded by people (if that is what you need).  It is not an insult. It is not a \"dig\" at her.  You just spend time doing something that she does not like to do.  Maybe she can pick up a hobby or something to do while you are gone camping.  Couples do not have to be joined at the hip 24/7.

You couldn't let her tag along a single time? Come on.", "Despite other views, I will say NTA.  Your girlfriend wants to feel involved in your hobbies, but is not willing to sacrifice materialism.  Couples should spend time away from each other, making their bond stronger.  If not, then you're not truly independent.

I told her what I do and she went \" That cant be all you do that seems so boring dont you go to a restaurant or something\". I told her nah thats really all I do when I head out and she didn't believe me so she wanted to tag along with me on this weekends trip.\n\n  \ni told her that I didn't want her to come with me since i know she wont enjoy herself and be miserable and also cause i like it cause it lets me disconnect and bringing people along with me kinda defeats the purpose. She got sad since she assumed that I was only doing it s=so taht i could spend time away from her which isnt true and refuses to believe me now.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It just sounds like he doesn't want her involved at all, which I think anyone would be a bit disheartened about.

Lol", "OPs hobby involves being in the woods and his girlfriend likes being at home. Are you suggesting OP gives up his hobbies to appease his girlfriend?", "Working from home in the same house isn\u2019t quality time spent together. Weekends are pretty commonly understood as socializing/ relaxing/ etc. time that is typically spent together when people are in a committed relationship. Obviously everyone needs solo time, activities with friends that don\u2019t include your SO, etc. but going away for solo time 50% of weekends seems excessive, and if I were the gf I would also feel as though my bf was trying to get away from me.", "It depends on the relationship. That may work for you but not for other people. It sounds like his partner isn't ok with him being away that often without her, and that's valid for her. If they can't come to a compromise then maybe, as I've stated twice now, they aren't compatible. Neither one is an asshole, they just have different expectations and needs.", "Every so often is healthy. 50% of your free time is not \"every so often\".", "You sound dismissive of how she thinks the relationship should be balanced. YOU think it\u2019s the best idea for you both if you take off twice a month, even if you now know it\u2019s clearly hurting her feelings. Have you asked how SHE thinks the relationship should be balanced? Maybe you could do one solo trip with your bike, and one weekend a month with her where you do some of your stuff, and branch out and find something for her too (she mentioned restaurants and stuff). As of right now you sort of sound like the 50 year old man who goes golfing every weekend to avoid his wife\u2019s company.", "Right every so often if fine! It's totally healthy and normal to spend time away from your partner... but dude you're going away every other weekend, that's not every so often, that's quite frequently", "Man.  Even reddit thinks you're cheating and lying to them.", "Every so often isn't half of your free time, my dude. I am feeling really bad for her.", "Time apart is very healthy. Having your own hobbies is very healthy.  Every other weekend is not excessive. Don\u2019t listen to these people. I\u2019ve learned many lessons in my 16 years of marriage.", "You \u201cdon\u2019t have a problem\u201d seeing her every day?\n\nWake up call. You\u2019re in a situationship. You don\u2019t want to be with her, you\u2019re just okay with it. If you don\u2019t actively *want* to see your girlfriend, you should not be in a relationship. \n\nConvenient =/= desire. Just saying..", "What full-time job pays people to be at home but not working? I want in on this.", "Spending time at home while you both are working is not quality time. Even if there are lulls in the day that allow for some conversation or tv or whatever. Do you do anything nice together? Do you ever take a weekend trip together or vacation together? Do you ever prioritize a nice weekend with her and what she wants to do? Or is it only about you? Every other weekend seems like an awful amount of time to be doing this. Pretty selfish IMO.\n\nI see a lot of soft YTA but my feeling is this is a little worse and more selfish than you\u2019re admitting.", "NTA for camping alone every two weeks, with this explanation. Doesn't your gf have friends she can see on those weekends? Or hobbies that she does alone? \n\nI love my husband, but if we were together at home all day on weekdays, I'd be looking forward to having the place to myself for 36 hours every couple of weeks.", "You might want to add this in an edit to your main post; it does have a lot of bearing on you going camping every other weekend. NTA but as others have advised maybe take her just once even if she hates it. She may be imaging all sorts of things (possibly involving another girl even) and at least she'll see that what you said you are doing is literally all you are doing. My aunt didn't believe us when we said what we did when we go camping until she joined us because it just isn't her thing and she couldn't comprehend not shopping or 'going somewhere' other than nature lol. She now just thinks we're boring. ;)", "You should have cleared this information \ud83d\ude05", "In that case, if you don't just actually work all day at home and just see eachother but also spend actual quality time together often: Doesn't your gf have anyone else to spend her time with like friends or hobbies she can do alone?\n\nAlso: is she generally clingy or could she perhaps even think you're cheating because she's insecure about you leaving every 2nd weekend? In no healthy relationship partners spend 24/7/365 together, that just doesn't work out, you're still different people.", "What?...", "Earplugs exist....which I would totally recommend to everyone who rides motorcycles or dirt bikes.", "Oh yeah!  We have neighbors who made a dirt bike course in a field behind our house for their teenage sons who are into dirt bike racing, and in the summer the RINRINRIN is fucking nonstop during daylight hours!  I hate that sound with the fire of 10,000 suns!", "I live literally across the street from the entrance to many dirt bike trails.\n\nI used to have dirt bikes.  I absolutely loved them.  I'd go everywhere on my dirt bike.\n\nI now hate them because of the noise it causes right outside my house, multiple times per day, all year.", "Thats why he goes ALONE", "Honestly I love the way a dirt bike sounds. Even if I didnt have mine I would listen with a tad of jealousy. But ive been riding since I was 8yo.", "Unclear.  I've heard people call bicycles \"dirt bikes,\" and I've heard people call motorcycles \"dirt bikes.\"  I wonder which one he's referring to?  Both are fantastic.", "Yep. If I spent that much time with my partner during the week I'd be gone every other weekend, too. It's not about how much you love the person, it's about having some time to yourself.", "If my boyfriend was leaving me every other weekend to go camping alone, after a couple of months I would start to suspect that he's actually cheating on me. So if I the asked to go with him once and he told me no, it would add forget fuel to the thought for me. I don't think that's what this guy is doing, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's what SHE thinks he's doing.", "Right? Doing it sometimes, yeah, cool, but every other weekend you *need* to do it? Then maybe there are bigger problems in your relationship you're running from.\n\nNot that he can't have hobbies. But he says he \"does it to disconnect\" and that bringing people would \"defeat the purpose.\" So then she asks if it was to get away from *her* and all of a sudden it's \"no, baby, it's not like that. i can't stand to be around anyone I love more than two weeks in a row without a complete break.\"\n\nThese two are just downright incompatible. He needs someone who would love to go on these outdoorsy trips and enjoy it with him, not someone who thinks there are restaurants at camping sites that he has to run away from on a biweekly basis.", "I agree, I was thinking once a month would be reasonable", "You say you're not clingy, but your comment says otherwise.", "This! He is gone EVERY OTHER weekend. Assuming he has a weekday job, that means he's basically spending 50% of all his time away from her. If she actually turns out to like the activity, awesome! Otherwise he might find out she doesn't like the compromise of having a 50% boyfriend. Or worse, she thinks he's out there with someone else.", "Right?\n\nMost of the time you\u2019d expect the issue being that she doesn\u2019t want to come camping. But nope. OP doesn\u2019t want to share his passion for camping with her. He needs alone time. \n\nI\u2019m an introvert. I\u2019m not big on people. But I love my husband. I love camping with him. And it\u2019s not the camping as much as sharing this experience with someone I love. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d feel if my SO face palmed me about camping with him. \n\nGF needs a new BF.", "Nope. I am suggesting that relationships don't tend to last if one person wants to spend every other weekend doing something away from their partner.\n\nAs such, being as the GF has seemingly never tried camping before, it makes sense to at least give her one shot at it. Maybe she'll like it more than she thinks, such that perhaps she'll go camping with him once a month. Or, alternatively, maybe she'll hate it, in which case presumably they'll inevitably drift apart and break up eventually.", "Not really i mean we both work jobs that leave most of our day free and we wfh so its not that much of my free time", "I mean we work for a few hours and the rest of the day we are free since neither of us work more than 2-4 hours a day so i think it counts. We go out every thursday for a dinner date so I think every other weekend alone is okei", "We bought our property long before they started their little hobby, we own our property while they rent the field from a farmer, and finally we bought a home in the country because we wanted the peace of the country.  If I had wanted to listen to engines all day I would have bought a house next to a race track.  But seeing as how we are grownups and not oversized children, we've planted several rows of fast growing deciduous trees and shrubs as well as some evergreens to create some sound baffling because as grownups we recognize that others have the right to exist and enjoy their lives, no matter how irritating they are.", "You could always buy a house in a neighborhood instead of bitching about how people enjoy themselves out in the country on their own land", "They spend 10-12 non-working waking hours awake. They both work from home and only a few hours a day. Even with 8 hours of sleep, that's still 10-12 hours every day in the same dwelling with another person. You would need to disconnect too.", "They both work from home", "You do know that there are other days besides the weekend to hang out with your BF or GF?   \n\n\nSo twice a month he spends Sat-Sun doing something he prefers to be alone....he is half a BF?", "Your gf doesn't think it's \"okei.\" \n\nYou like her enough to live with her, you might consider her feelings every now and again. \n\nAnd how are you both working 2-4 hours a day and surviving? \n\nAlso, when you're spending time together at home, are you spending quality time together or just screwing around on your phone etc?", "It is in a field behind their house, not in the neighbors yard.  It is very likely that they trespass when riding.  Had this problem near my dads house.  Neighbors did not care if someone bought the property, they felt entitled to ride their dirt bikes on the property and wreck anything placed there by the owner.", "So? Usually when you work from home you are...working? Taking lunch break together it's not the same thing as spending quality time with your SO.", "we get paid a salary not hourly and she doesnt have a problem with me spending time alone she just has a problem with me not wanting her to check on what im doing", "Read some of OP's replies to comments on his previous posts. They only work a few hours a day. They spend 10-12 waking, non-working hours together. I would want to disconnect too", "I would love to know what you do salary that allows you both to work that minimally, but I don't want to go on a tangent.\n\nNever in your post did you say her problem was that she couldn't reach you. \n\nWhat, in HER WORDS, does she want? Does she want you to go less often? Does she want to accompany you at least part of the time? Does she want you to check in a couple of times so she knows you're safe?", "I think your attitude about this is the major problem. What you think is her \u201cchecking in on you\u201d seems more like an attempt to take an interest in you. Let her decide she wouldn\u2019t like it. You making the decision for her is majorly what makes YTA.", "You sound very contemptuous of her point of view. Do you actually like her, enjoy spending time with her and have activities you can both enjoy together?", "Oh, wow, I missed that. Thank you! \n\nI would definitely need a break, too.", "He\u2019s just not that into her. My husband and I also both work from home, and we also spend time together throughout the day. We can\u2019t WAIT for the weekend together.\n\nOP sounds like he\u2019d be much happier in a lower commitment situationship, where he doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone or go out on more than one date per week max."]}
