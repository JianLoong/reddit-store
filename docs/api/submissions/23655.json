I\u2019m staying with them for two weeks. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m staying with them in their home, usually I stay at a hotel but they recently bought a bigger home so I asked to stay. My grandchild (3m) is generally very good but occasionally he does things that I don\u2019t find appropriate. I am quick to correct these behaviors. For example, he will chew on his stuffed animals and I tell him \u201cstop don\u2019t do that\u201d, but then my DIL will correct me and say \u201cno it\u2019s comforting to him\u201d. Or she will let him do the stairs by himself and when I yelled at him to \u201cbe careful\u201d and \u201cwait for grandma\u201d. My DIL told me that he has been doing the stairs and it\u2019s better to give him \u201cconfidence\u201d with a watchful eye instead of carrying him. My DIL and I have a lot of differing opinions on things. When grandson was a newborn, she wouldn\u2019t let me kiss him which really hurt my feelings since I didn\u2019t get to bond with him as much as I wanted. My son called me and said maybe to get a hotel because he and DIL (I\u2019m guessing DIL only though) feel uncomfortable since I try to always correct my grandson and I don\u2019t leave the parenting up to them when I\u2019m around. This might sound harsh but I feel like my DIL is the AH because she shouldn\u2019t be correcting me, I have a lot of experience. AITAH?\n\nEdit: hopefully I\u2019m doing this right. Sounds like I\u2019m the AH. I think a lot has changed since I was a parent. I\u2019m used to grandparents stepping in. I have two sons. I have no issues with my other son (32m). I miss the days where we had a village. It seems my DIL doesn\u2019t want that. I do understand the kissing newborn thing and I was wrong. I have different views on independence with kids and parenting. Where do I go from here? I know I need to have a conversation with them. Sounds like I need to apologize. I think it will take a while for me to make a change because I still believe what I believe.", "created_utc": 1690902979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ffg9p/aitah_for_correcting_my_grandchild/", "score": 287, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m going to explain that - babies genuinely shouldn\u2019t be kissed around the face as neonatal herpes exists. Herpes as in cold sores can be deadly to infants and anyone who carries the disease? Can transmit to those who are infants/immunocompromised even if they do not have an active flair up. This can be deadly to both infants and immunocompromised people. I know this as I have immunocompromised status and it\u2019s one of the things my doctor told me as I\u2019d never had coldsores before. No one can be sure if they have herpes so the best thing to do is not let the child be kissed.\n\nAs for the rest? Stop butting in. It may be your grandson\u2026 However? It is your child\u2019s and DIL\u2019s son. Not yours. They are the be all and end all when it comes to parenting and you should be following their rules in regards to how they want to bring up their child. It doesn\u2019t matter how much experience you have - they do not have to take any of your advice.", "YTA. They are the parents, not you. You shouldn't be kissing newborns if you're not the parent. Especially during a pandemic, if he's 3yo he was born during the first year of covid.\n\nA three year old is completely cabable to go up and down the stairs. If he falls, he'll get an ouchie and learn to be more careful.\n\nLet the kid chew on stuffed animals, they are not poison. \n\nI just spent a long weekend with my 3yo niece and she was running in the woods, \"worked\" in our veggie garden, played with the dogs and probably ate some sand from the sandbox.

You had your chance to be a parent, now it's their turn. It sounds like she's being a good mom to her child. You need to rein yourself in and stop resenting your DIL so much.

He doesn't need to be helicoptered.", "YTA. \"they bought a bigger home so I asked to stay\". You invited yourself.

You're the grandmother. DIL is the mother and gets final say in how to raise *her* child.\n\nStop making this all about you and stop pouting. Yes, you are pouting, the whole \"she wouldn't let me kiss him,\" is just that, pouting. And not letting the newborn being passed around and kissed by everyone who thinks they have some perverse right to molest a child is actually healthier for the baby. That's a good indicator DIL knows what's she doing.\n\nYou want to help DIL?

Every example you gave of correcting the child is a major red flag, of course you shouldnt kiss a newborn and you are in no way entitled to physical affection towards or from anyone ever.

I\u2019d be interested in learning how & why things change & if they asked my advice I would suggest what I used to do to that worked back then but would never insist they do it, instead I would try to be supportive with the ideas she may have come up with, especially if what worked back then isn\u2019t done now. For example 2 of my boys loved dummy\u2019s 2 were thumb suckers & all 4 slept in our bed with us from birth as it meant for a better nights sleep all round & tbf all 4 slept through from a few weeks. But I now know that is strongly advised against so would never suggest it but would maybe IF ASKED suggest one of those little cot things that connect to the side of the parents bed (sorry don\u2019t know the name) & possibly offer to buy one if they were struggling but would never dream of insisting that\u2019s what they do! \n\nIf you really want to be part of your grandchild\u2019s life & your sons learn to bite your tongue; accept their way of doing things is right for them & back off!

It\u2019s unreal that you even think you\u2019re in the right at all. \n\nI\u2019ll break it down for you as someone with a 3 year old son. \n1. He was born during a pandemic where no one was safe to interact with. My child was barely help or looked after until he was 1. It wasn\u2019t safe. Pandemic or not, don\u2019t kiss babies!!! It puts them at serious risk due to their immune systems. Jesus. It\u2019s not anything new. \n2. He\u2019s 3. He can do the stairs. He can run, and jump, and climb, and a whole bunch of other stuff. My child would be outraged if you dared ask him to wait going up the stairs because you thought he needed help. They\u2019re more than capable or judging their own balance by themselves. Yes they\u2019re clumsy, but they\u2019re learning and usually very able by 3. \n3. The audacity that you have speak about your DIL like that is unreal and you\u2019re very swiftly going to find yourself without access to them. I mean, she knows her child. On one hand, you\u2019re saying he\u2019s too old to be chewing his comforter and on the other that he\u2019s not big enough to do the stairs. Seriously. The child\u2019s mother sounds more than capable of knowing what her child needs. Her child. Not yours. \n4. Your outdated and quite frankly wrong views of parenting are killing the relationship you have with them. Stop thinking about how you did things or the \u201cvillage\u201d. The village is there for support, not for constant criticism and undermining everything they do. They aren\u2019t raising a child the same way you did. No one my age would want to raise their child how our parents raised us. There are so many harmful things that were said and done that we don\u2019t want to make the same mistakes. So own up to it being different, and better in my opinion, and accept that if you want to be in their lives then you need to stop voicing your ridiculous opinions and seriously think about your own values. \n5. The way you give yourself credit for how your son turned out is concerning. I\u2019m not going to say that you\u2019re a bad mother or anything even close to it, but many people turn out decent in spite of their parents. I know for certain that I did, and my own mother likes to claim credit as well and it\u2019s exhausting. You clearly love you son and if you still want to be part of his life, then you need to change and reassess how you look at things. He\u2019s got a son who by all means sounds to be thriving. That\u2019s partly him and partly your DIL. Don\u2019t undermine what they\u2019re doing or you won\u2019t be around to see him grow up.

The problem with the whole \"It takes a village mindset\" is generally that introduces like 10 different disclipine systems. I much prefer the whole idea of parents taking care of their kids but people who have similar ideas of disclipine can help out (selective village if I had to give it a name but idk if there is already one out there). If the ideas/morals clash then there is no need to be included and confuse the child. Some people this works fine for other people it does not. Generally in many cases \"it takes a village\" mentality just reinforce outdated ideas and generational trauma which the parents/younger generations are trying to avoid. It can range from so many things like proper hygiene (like not kissing a young baby), to things like rejecting traditionally sexist notions (like men do not have to learn to cook because they will always have someone to cook for them which is leading alot of men to not be able to take care of them selves after they have a breakup/divorce) there can be many reasons. And the obvious clash in parenting styles seems to be the major one.

I\u2019m (65f) visiting my son (27m) and daughter-in-law (26f) in a month. I\u2019m staying with them for two weeks. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m staying with them in their home, usually I stay at a hotel but they recently bought a bigger home so I asked to stay. My grandchild (3m) is generally very good but occasionally he does things that I don\u2019t find appropriate. I am quick to correct these behaviors. For example, he will chew on his stuffed animals and I tell him \u201cstop don\u2019t do that\u201d, but then my DIL will correct me and say \u201cno it\u2019s comforting to him\u201d. Or she will let him do the stairs by himself and when I yelled at him to \u201cbe careful\u201d and \u201cwait for grandma\u201d. My DIL told me that he has been doing the stairs and it\u2019s better to give him \u201cconfidence\u201d with a watchful eye instead of carrying him. My DIL and I have a lot of differing opinions on things. When grandson was a newborn, she wouldn\u2019t let me kiss him which really hurt my feelings since I didn\u2019t get to bond with him as much as I wanted. My son called me and said maybe to get a hotel because he and DIL (I\u2019m guessing DIL only though) feel uncomfortable since I try to always correct my grandson and I don\u2019t leave the parenting up to them when I\u2019m around. This might sound harsh but I feel like my DIL is the AH because she shouldn\u2019t be correcting me, I have a lot of experience. AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please if you can\u2019t change your beliefs, try to believe in them. Surely they want to do the best by their child and in time may welcome advice or help from you.

I realize this is very different than how you were raised, but the world has changed dramatically as we have learned so much about kids and their development in the past few decades. \n\nWe also learned that automatically defaulting to our mothers and grandmothers when we didn\u2019t know what we were doing as parents is no longer the way; now parents have access to the best, most recent knowledge at our fingertips, no need to call and depend upon Mom. \n\nThis also means that we are not repeating the same mistakes over and over in every generation like we used to. As you learned here today, you\u2019ve been making lots of mistakes over the years with your oral herpes, and only now is your behavior going to change. You could have given your toddler grandchild oral herpes had your DIL & Son not intervened, right?

For our generation we have all the information, books, doctors, peers, networks and scientific studies available to us at the palm of our hands. You didn't. You may have had the local library with who knows what kind of selection of outdated information, other parents of the neighbourhood and then your older relatives, who might have learned their knowledge from their older relatives and so on, without anyone updating or correcting anything in between. This is how harmfull, or in my country rightfully illegal things like physical violence (\"spanking\", hair pulling etc) lived on through generations.\n\nYour generation also became parents at a much younger age than our generation usually do (20 vs. 30-year-old).

I on the other hand was 31 when I became a mom and had loads more life experience than she did at the time.\n\nMy mom's generation was also taught to always respect your elders, even when they wouldn't deserve it and were traumatizing, violent, raging alcoholics like my grandfather.

I'm sure you did the best you could with the knowledge and resourses you had.
