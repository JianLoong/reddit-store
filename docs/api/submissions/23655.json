I\u2019m staying with them for two weeks. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m staying with them in their home, usually I stay at a hotel but they recently bought a bigger home so I asked to stay. My grandchild (3m) is generally very good but occasionally he does things that I don\u2019t find appropriate. I am quick to correct these behaviors. For example, he will chew on his stuffed animals and I tell him \u201cstop don\u2019t do that\u201d, but then my DIL will correct me and say \u201cno it\u2019s comforting to him\u201d. Or she will let him do the stairs by himself and when I yelled at him to \u201cbe careful\u201d and \u201cwait for grandma\u201d. My DIL told me that he has been doing the stairs and it\u2019s better to give him \u201cconfidence\u201d with a watchful eye instead of carrying him. My DIL and I have a lot of differing opinions on things. When grandson was a newborn, she wouldn\u2019t let me kiss him which really hurt my feelings since I didn\u2019t get to bond with him as much as I wanted. My son called me and said maybe to get a hotel because he and DIL (I\u2019m guessing DIL only though) feel uncomfortable since I try to always correct my grandson and I don\u2019t leave the parenting up to them when I\u2019m around. This might sound harsh but I feel like my DIL is the AH because she shouldn\u2019t be correcting me, I have a lot of experience. AITAH?\n\nEdit: hopefully I\u2019m doing this right. Sounds like I\u2019m the AH. I think a lot has changed since I was a parent. I\u2019m used to grandparents stepping in. I have two sons. I have no issues with my other son (32m). I miss the days where we had a village. It seems my DIL doesn\u2019t want that. I do understand the kissing newborn thing and I was wrong. I have different views on independence with kids and parenting. Where do I go from here? I know I need to have a conversation with them. Sounds like I need to apologize. I think it will take a while for me to make a change because I still believe what I believe.", "created_utc": 1690902979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ffg9p/aitah_for_correcting_my_grandchild/", "score": 931, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m going to explain that - babies genuinely shouldn\u2019t be kissed around the face as neonatal herpes exists. Herpes as in cold sores can be deadly to infants and anyone who carries the disease? Can transmit to those who are infants/immunocompromised even if they do not have an active flair up. This can be deadly to both infants and immunocompromised people. I know this as I have immunocompromised status and it\u2019s one of the things my doctor told me as I\u2019d never had coldsores before. No one can be sure if they have herpes so the best thing to do is not let the child be kissed.\n\nAs for the rest? Stop butting in. It may be your grandson\u2026 However? It is your child\u2019s and DIL\u2019s son. Not yours. They are the be all and end all when it comes to parenting and you should be following their rules in regards to how they want to bring up their child. It doesn\u2019t matter how much experience you have - they do not have to take any of your advice.", "YTA. They are the parents, not you. You shouldn't be kissing newborns if you're not the parent. Especially during a pandemic, if he's 3yo he was born during the first year of covid.\n\nA three year old is completely cabable to go up and down the stairs. If he falls, he'll get an ouchie and learn to be more careful.\n\nLet the kid chew on stuffed animals, they are not poison. \n\nI just spent a long weekend with my 3yo niece and she was running in the woods, \"worked\" in our veggie garden, played with the dogs and probably ate some sand from the sandbox.

You had your chance to be a parent, now it's their turn. It sounds like she's being a good mom to her child. You need to rein yourself in and stop resenting your DIL so much.

He doesn't need to be helicoptered.", "YTA. \"they bought a bigger home so I asked to stay\". You invited yourself.

You're the grandmother. DIL is the mother and gets final say in how to raise *her* child.\n\nStop making this all about you and stop pouting. Yes, you are pouting, the whole \"she wouldn't let me kiss him,\" is just that, pouting. And not letting the newborn being passed around and kissed by everyone who thinks they have some perverse right to molest a child is actually healthier for the baby. That's a good indicator DIL knows what's she doing.\n\nYou want to help DIL?

Every example you gave of correcting the child is a major red flag, of course you shouldnt kiss a newborn and you are in no way entitled to physical affection towards or from anyone ever.

I\u2019d be interested in learning how & why things change & if they asked my advice I would suggest what I used to do to that worked back then but would never insist they do it, instead I would try to be supportive with the ideas she may have come up with, especially if what worked back then isn\u2019t done now. For example 2 of my boys loved dummy\u2019s 2 were thumb suckers & all 4 slept in our bed with us from birth as it meant for a better nights sleep all round & tbf all 4 slept through from a few weeks. But I now know that is strongly advised against so would never suggest it but would maybe IF ASKED suggest one of those little cot things that connect to the side of the parents bed (sorry don\u2019t know the name) & possibly offer to buy one if they were struggling but would never dream of insisting that\u2019s what they do! \n\nIf you really want to be part of your grandchild\u2019s life & your sons learn to bite your tongue; accept their way of doing things is right for them & back off!

It\u2019s unreal that you even think you\u2019re in the right at all. \n\nI\u2019ll break it down for you as someone with a 3 year old son. \n1. He was born during a pandemic where no one was safe to interact with. My child was barely help or looked after until he was 1. It wasn\u2019t safe. Pandemic or not, don\u2019t kiss babies!!! It puts them at serious risk due to their immune systems. Jesus. It\u2019s not anything new. \n2. He\u2019s 3. He can do the stairs. He can run, and jump, and climb, and a whole bunch of other stuff. My child would be outraged if you dared ask him to wait going up the stairs because you thought he needed help. They\u2019re more than capable or judging their own balance by themselves. Yes they\u2019re clumsy, but they\u2019re learning and usually very able by 3. \n3. The audacity that you have speak about your DIL like that is unreal and you\u2019re very swiftly going to find yourself without access to them. I mean, she knows her child. On one hand, you\u2019re saying he\u2019s too old to be chewing his comforter and on the other that he\u2019s not big enough to do the stairs. Seriously. The child\u2019s mother sounds more than capable of knowing what her child needs. Her child. Not yours. \n4. Your outdated and quite frankly wrong views of parenting are killing the relationship you have with them. Stop thinking about how you did things or the \u201cvillage\u201d. The village is there for support, not for constant criticism and undermining everything they do. They aren\u2019t raising a child the same way you did. No one my age would want to raise their child how our parents raised us. There are so many harmful things that were said and done that we don\u2019t want to make the same mistakes. So own up to it being different, and better in my opinion, and accept that if you want to be in their lives then you need to stop voicing your ridiculous opinions and seriously think about your own values. \n5. The way you give yourself credit for how your son turned out is concerning. I\u2019m not going to say that you\u2019re a bad mother or anything even close to it, but many people turn out decent in spite of their parents. I know for certain that I did, and my own mother likes to claim credit as well and it\u2019s exhausting. You clearly love you son and if you still want to be part of his life, then you need to change and reassess how you look at things. He\u2019s got a son who by all means sounds to be thriving. That\u2019s partly him and partly your DIL. Don\u2019t undermine what they\u2019re doing or you won\u2019t be around to see him grow up.

The problem with the whole \"It takes a village mindset\" is generally that introduces like 10 different disclipine systems. I much prefer the whole idea of parents taking care of their kids but people who have similar ideas of disclipine can help out (selective village if I had to give it a name but idk if there is already one out there). If the ideas/morals clash then there is no need to be included and confuse the child. Some people this works fine for other people it does not. Generally in many cases \"it takes a village\" mentality just reinforce outdated ideas and generational trauma which the parents/younger generations are trying to avoid. It can range from so many things like proper hygiene (like not kissing a young baby), to things like rejecting traditionally sexist notions (like men do not have to learn to cook because they will always have someone to cook for them which is leading alot of men to not be able to take care of them selves after they have a breakup/divorce) there can be many reasons. And the obvious clash in parenting styles seems to be the major one.

I\u2019m (65f) visiting my son (27m) and daughter-in-law (26f) in a month. I\u2019m staying with them for two weeks. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m staying with them in their home, usually I stay at a hotel but they recently bought a bigger home so I asked to stay. My grandchild (3m) is generally very good but occasionally he does things that I don\u2019t find appropriate. I am quick to correct these behaviors. For example, he will chew on his stuffed animals and I tell him \u201cstop don\u2019t do that\u201d, but then my DIL will correct me and say \u201cno it\u2019s comforting to him\u201d. Or she will let him do the stairs by himself and when I yelled at him to \u201cbe careful\u201d and \u201cwait for grandma\u201d. My DIL told me that he has been doing the stairs and it\u2019s better to give him \u201cconfidence\u201d with a watchful eye instead of carrying him. My DIL and I have a lot of differing opinions on things. When grandson was a newborn, she wouldn\u2019t let me kiss him which really hurt my feelings since I didn\u2019t get to bond with him as much as I wanted. My son called me and said maybe to get a hotel because he and DIL (I\u2019m guessing DIL only though) feel uncomfortable since I try to always correct my grandson and I don\u2019t leave the parenting up to them when I\u2019m around. This might sound harsh but I feel like my DIL is the AH because she shouldn\u2019t be correcting me, I have a lot of experience. AITAH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please if you can\u2019t change your beliefs, try to believe in them. Surely they want to do the best by their child and in time may welcome advice or help from you.

I realize this is very different than how you were raised, but the world has changed dramatically as we have learned so much about kids and their development in the past few decades. \n\nWe also learned that automatically defaulting to our mothers and grandmothers when we didn\u2019t know what we were doing as parents is no longer the way; now parents have access to the best, most recent knowledge at our fingertips, no need to call and depend upon Mom. \n\nThis also means that we are not repeating the same mistakes over and over in every generation like we used to. As you learned here today, you\u2019ve been making lots of mistakes over the years with your oral herpes, and only now is your behavior going to change. You could have given your toddler grandchild oral herpes had your DIL & Son not intervened, right?

Everything that you have written is so disrespectful to them as parents and your \u201cexperience\u201d is outdated and (mostly) wrong.

Parenting has changed a lot between your generation and your son's. My spouse and I have the same philosophy on parenting, and if either of us were to say \"we\", it would not be code for \"*the daughter in law and I'm just tagging along*\".  In a healthy relationship, parents will likely have conversations on what disciplining looks like, what to correct, and what to foster. In this context, you really don't want your child to have multiple sets of rules in their house. \n\nAlso, you and your son may have different views on what grandparenting looks like. In our case, we do not expect our grand parents to do any of the child raising. It's important for us that our parents bond with our child, but we don't expect actual parenting. Our parents are our guests when they come to our home, and we don't expect them to support us. It really is just a \"enjoy your time with your grandchild\" situation. We of course expect them to correct rude / disrespectful behavior (*that wasn't nice to grandma*), but that's about it.\n\nI think you should all sit down and see what the expectations are, and then you stick to their boundaries.\n\nAs an aside, my daughter is 3, so she was born at the height of the pandemic. You're lucky you were even able to see your grandchild. We didn't let anyone get close to her for a good 6 months. Back then, there were no studies on how COVID affected newborns that have developing immune systems. Reading that comment about the kissing reads to me like someone saying \"*sure, there was a risk of death, but I also really wanted to kiss my grandchild*\"  This was not a good thing to hold resentment over, and if anyone had started prioritizing kissing my daughter over the health risks, I would have probably written them out of my life. While this may sound harsh, you really need to drill into your mind that for your son and DIL, it looked like your desire to kiss your grandchild was more important than a very serious health outcome.", "YTA. Not sure what \u201cvillage\u201d you had growing up, but I grew up in with an amazing village with 4 involved grandparents.

Having a village means you have people to support you in your parenting journey, not people who come in and stomp all over your decisions and get butthurt over being asked to stop.

Well, he still learnt how to climb stairs on his own at 3 and a half despite never being shown by me and he's never had any accidents in the several months he's been doing this. It really isn't necessary to carry a child of this age upstairs. In any case, you aren't there the majority of the time and he goes up and downstairs by himself all the time when you are not there, so you'd just be confusing him by going against what he normally does in his home. He's your grandson yes, but you need to leave the parenting to his parents. I say this as a grandma too (my oldest child is 27, youngest is 4 and I have 5 grandchildren).  Chewing a stuffed toy? Kids put stuff in their mouths. I think you're trying to micromanage him a bit. It's not a big deal. As for the kissing, I think that would be due to herpes as it can kill newborns and is spread by kissing. They were just worried and not trying to impede your bonding with him.

Or if he hits you or a pet or something. \n\nOne other note - in your example, you said you tell him \"Don't do that.\" I've seen my stepdad say that to my kids (2 at the time) and it doesn't really work, because the kids don't know what \"that\" is that they're being admonished for. An approach that is becoming much more common is to say something along the lines of, \"no thank you, we don't do X. That can (hurt you, hurt someone, make a mess, etc). \" And then there's often a follow on of \"why did you do X? How were you feeling? Next time, what can you do instead? -insert suggestion for child here-\" \n\nIt sounds like there is a generational difference in approaches.", "You sound insufferable.

First off, you need to be talking to both your DIL *and* son, bc their marriage is a partnership amd they're a team when it comes to raising their son. The DIL doesn't make unilateral decisions about raising him-your son gets equal say, and they make their decisions together. \n\nI think what you need to understand is that as the grandmother your responsibility is to support the parents in how *they* raise their kid, not bulldoze their decisions and make your own under the guise of \"helping.\" If you want to give advice based on your own experiences, ask if they want it before giving it, and be understanding if they don't want it. When they make decision that you disagree with, instead of ignoring it or challenging it or whatever, maybe ask questions so you can understand. Let them know you're not fighting their decisions but that this is a new idea to you and that you want to understand it so you're treating your grandchild in the best way you can. \n\nI think you also need to understand that as our understanding of physiology and psychology develop, so too will child rearing. New ideas often come about bc we learn about the long-term effects of past ideas, and an effort is made to facilitate child development so there's as much positive effect as possible.

This is not a critique on your whole being, but your actions right now which you have the power to change and which are harmful to your grandson's independence and development.\n\nYou have to decide, is having your opinion respected truly more important than doing all that you can to be the best caregiver to your grandson given all of the information that is available today? Think about it this way: if you went to your doctor to get a surgery and they were using medical techniques from 30 years ago, wouldn't you want them to prioritize doing things based on the most updated research possible, not just on doing what they were used to doing?\n\nAgain, just hold off on talking to your DIL until you've done some learning on your own. Take this opportunity to learn with grace.", "You didn't like being corrected by her but think about how much worse it was for her!

She's the mom. She doesn't *need* to care about anyone else's opinions on parenting other than doctors, police, and the baby's father.\n\nIf you are a nice and reasonable person who respects *her* and her position as the parent, then she may extend the honor of valuing your opinion. But you are not entitled to that as a form of basic respect.\n\nLike, imagine someone coming into your house and redoing your decorations without asking, or coming into the kitchen and adding spices to the thing you're cooking. Then when you complain that they are being presumptuous and ask them to stop, they say they feel disrespected because you don't value their opinion on interior decorating or cuisine. Wouldn't that be ridiculous? It's *your house* and *your recipe*. And someone's child is just as much their domain. It's not that you can never share wisdom - they might ask for input sometimes, and you might offer suggestions if they seem unsure what to do, but if they're confidently doing things the way they want to, it isn't appropriate.", "You shouldn\u2019t try redirecting because you\u2019re not his parent. The only redirecting you should be doing is your own behaviour. \n\nI feel like you\u2019re not getting how serious this is: your adult son told you that you aren\u2019t welcome to stay in his home because of how disrespectful you are to his wife and their parenting.", "I taught all my children (the oldest is now 28) to crawl up and down stairs before they walked when they still crawled.

Yeah? They know your grandchild just as well you know your own son. And isn't that such a beautiful thing? You raised a good man and now it's his turn to do the same. As a grandparent your job is to sit back and let them do the hard work while you enjoy the beautiful process.\n\n(Look up anxiety, it's a more modern word for nervous and there's better help available for nerves these days just like there's better help available for raising little ones these days.)", "Exactly this!

Again, it's the inability to respect the son's autonomy...Op's son told op that \"he *and* DIL\" don't like her behavior, but she can't even take her son's own words at face value and ascribes her own meaning to them and basically ignores what he told her, and blames DIL. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEta: it's clear op doesn't like DIL...but given that op thinks the son is just a spineless messenger for DIL, does op even like her son?", "My mom has it, but has taken such care that I (in my 50s) never got it, and neither did my kid (in her 20s), despite Grandma babysitting often.

My mom is the same age as you, I'm mid-30s and have 3yo twins. My mom taught me a lot of the parenting principles that your son & DIL do now. It was a thing while parenting in the 80s too. Montessori was a thing then. Letting children learn confidence and independence was always a thing.\n\n2-4yos have always loved helping with chores and being \"independent\". My kids would go nuts if I tried to do everything for them, \"no mama, I do it myself\" has been a thing since forever.\n\nMaybe a 3yo seems younger to you because you haven't been around 3yos much in recent years? I guarantee after you see them going up and down stairs safely every day, it doesn't freak you out anymore.\n\nAs for scolding kids... I'd be happy for grandparents to scold my kids over some things (hitting, throwing stuff that could hurt people/break stuff, trying to run into traffic, etc) although I'd expect them to leave most of it to me if I was around. But chewing their own toys? That's a developmentally appropriate thing for a preschooler to do. If they're putting small stuff in their mouth and in danger of choking, then I'd have a convo with them (literally had to do this the other day with my daughter and she understood and didn't put the choking hazard in her mouth again), but a soft toy not so much. It's a little gross yes, but it's not going to harm anyone and they'll grow out of it.

In old letters I've read that my mom wrote she would talk about my older brother assisting her in refinishing furniture as a toddler. I'm sure he wasn't running a sander of course, but was the little gopher getting whatever needed to be got and bringing rags and what not. And all this to say, my dad who would be 81 used to make nut breads for the family when he was five. He'd do everything except light the oven and as soon as someone who was allowed to play with matches came home they'd pop the bread in the oven.

We had to be very strategic in who we let visit and what experiences we let the kids participate in.
