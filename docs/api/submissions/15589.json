She could have called the cops and you would have been charge with children abandonment.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is right.   You don't get to drop your kids on your sister's lap.  3 kids under 3 is a lot of responsibility that YOU chose to take on.

Was your sister involved when you decided to have your children? Was your mother?  Why do you feel entitled to everyone around you shifting their lives around to accommodate your need to have \u201cme\u201d time?  Your children are your responsibility. Your sister does not need a reason or an excuse for why she doesn\u2019t want to watch your kids for you.

I get that being a parent is exhausting but you chose that life and your sister's time is just as important as yours even though she's a non parent.\n\nDid you offer to pay her for her time or are you expecting free babysitting.\n\n\nModern parents can be very entitled", "\"**I just put my two oldest in her room and I left with my son...\"**\n\n If I was your sister, I would have called CPS and informed them you had just abandoned two of your children without supervision and have them remove the children from the home! \n\nYTA!!!", "YTA.

She has college lessons, and probably homework to do.\n\nIf you had asked once, then dropped it when she said no, that would have been fine, but you not only pushed the issue, you *forced* her to do it by leaving two of the kids with her.", "Look, as a single mom, I know the level of frustration and exhaustion you are feeling. However, that doesn't entitle you to force those children on anyone else. You can hope your family helps, but they don't have to. You do not have a right to free child care even if she did nothing but watch TV all day. \n\nGood rule of thumb for me, if I wouldn't do it to a friend, I shouldn't do it to family. Asking is usually acceptable, what you did wasn't asking. YTA.", "YTA! Your sister is a full-time college student. Just because it is on-line, it does not make it any less valid. On top of that, she works about 15hrs/wk. \n\nYou made the decision to have 3 children. That was YOUR CHOICE! You don't get to demand your sister provide you with unpaid labor. If you need time off, find a babysitter and PAY THEM!", "YTA.\n\nI can understand your pain and there's no harm in asking but you should've stopped when she said no. You don't need a good reason as to why someone can't do something for you and you certainly shouldn't have dumped your two kids off on her after she clearly said no.\n\nNo one is going to want to help you when you pull shit like that. \n\nAlso the father deciding to \"go on a different path in life\" is bullshit. He still needs to be held accountable here. These are his kids too. What are you doing about that? At the bare minimum, he should at least be paying child support here.", "YTA, you made em, you take care of them. Track down that deadbeat dad, make him pay you child support and you can hire a sitter every once in a while for a break.", "YTA \n\nWhen she says no then you drop it, she doesn\u2019t need to justify herself to you.\n\nYou chose to have 3 kids and now you have to suck it up and deal with parenting them. Even if she was unemployed and not studying she doesn\u2019t have a duty to watch your children. Dumping them in her room was not okay.", "Also, if you don't push people for an explanation they won't make one up.  She didn't *lie*.  \nYou were browbeating her and she was trying to get you to stop.", "YTA. That you're a mum of 3 isn't her problem. She doesn't need a reason to say no to you, you're not entitled to her as your on-demand babysitter.", "YTA for feeling entitled to free childcare. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to ask but she said no, period. Your kids are nobody\u2019s responsibility but yours. She doesn\u2019t need to give you a reason, \u201cno\u201d is a full sentence.", "So you abandoned 2 kids in the care of someone who is actively avoiding watching them?\n\nDoes that sound responsible to you?\n\nI get you need a break.  No one owes you free child care.  Full stop.  You are going to be lucky if your sis doesn't call the cops on y9u next time.", "YTA. Not for asking if she would, but by forcing her to even though she said no. \n\nLook, I\u2019m a parent of two young kids. I get how hard it can be and how you can really get burnt out. That\u2019s no excuse to leave them with someone else when they don\u2019t agree to watch them. If you need help, look into enrolling your children in early headstart (free if you they are on an IEP or if you qualify for WIC) or seeking out a part time babysitter. We all need breaks sometimes. But responsible adults plan for those breaks and make them happen in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt others.", "YTA, they\u2019re your kids not your sisters \nNot her fault the dad is out the picture and not her responsibility to take care of your kids either\nForcefully throwing the responsibility of taking care of 3 kids is weird too", "YTA.....who gets pregnant with 3 kids all a year apart in age? Have you never heard of birth control?  They're your kids, you are solely responsible for them. Next time choose your partners better....", "YTA, not her monkeys, not her zoo. I'm a mom of 3 as well, I have zero help from anyone. I chose to have them so it's on me to raise them. I also have no help from their dad. This is life I chose and it's no one else's responsibility to be saddled with them. \n\nIt's absolutely crazy to me that you just dumped your kids on someone without them agreeing to it.", "\u201cIf you loved me you would do this for me\u201d is so manipulative and you\u2019re 100% an asshole for this BS alone.", "YTA\n\nYou chose to have the kids. She didn\u2019t. Parenting is hard don\u2019t get me wrong I totally understand needing a break sometimes. But no one else is obliged to give you that unfortunately. I don\u2019t see where you offered to pay her for her time? You tried to emotionally blackmail her by saying if she lived you she would. And then even though she repeatedly said no you dumped two of your kids on her anyway and left. \n\nYou are owe the sister and both kids an apology to be honest.", "YTA. Unless sister is the dad you have no case here.", "Don\u2019t get how people don\u2019t understand nobody else is responsible for watching ur children. I\u2019m a parent too but I can\u2019t imagine believing I\u2019m entitled to others time no matter the context. YTA.", "Asking is allowed, insisting or demanding makes YTA.\n\nYou presumably wanted kids, they are your responsibility, not hers.", "Unfortunately YTA\n\nYou need a break and there's nothing wrong with asking for help but the way you went about it after being told no is wrong. \n\nCan't force someone to watch your kids, and probably not the best idea to leave them with someone who doesn't want to watch them as they may not be as observant.", "YTA. What on earth? Reasonably you shouldn\u2019t have had so many dang kids if you couldn\u2019t take care of them. You have to ask. Or pay. Both, really.", "Yta\n\nYou can ask, she can say no. \n\nYou were n a h at beginning until you kept digging after she said no. She doesn't owe you a reason, and she doesn't owe you child care. \n\nBeing a parent is stressful, but it's also a choice you made, because you have 3 children. One can be an accident, any kids after that are a choice you knowingly made.\n\nEdit to add- I completely missed the part where you full out abandoned your children... I wish there was a level above yta to judge you. She could have called the police on you for child abandonment, because you abandoned your children.", "YTA.  These are not her kids.  They are YOUR kids.  And yes, raising 3 kids on your own is hard but that was a choice you made - not your sister.", "YTA for not listening when she said no then abandoning two children with someone who refused to watch them. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t call cops on you. \n\nYou\u2019re also an asshole for acting like being a college student and working 15 hours a week does not equate to a full time job. Experts say that to be successful in college you need to spend 2-3 hours per week studying for every credit hour (some say 3 hours for STEM courses and 2 hours for the rest). \n\nMost students take 15 credit hours, so that\u2019s 45-60 hours per week plus another 15 at her job. Even if she was taking only 9 non-stem credit hours, that\u2019s 27 hours for school plus 15 for work. \n\nYour sister is most likely working very hard right now. I\u2019d bet she\u2019s stressed out and exhausted. Belittling her and what she\u2019s going through will ruin your relationship with her.", "Sorry but YTA. You decided to have three children with absent fathers. Your sister doesn't have to babysit your children because you need a break. They aren't her responsibility.

You asked her to watch your children, she said \"no\".", "YTA - \"why doesn't she want to babysit?\"  Because they are not her kids!  \n\nThey are yours, you are responsible for them, NOT HER!", "YTA \n\nThe only ones responsible for your kids are you and their father. Go bother him instead of your sister if you can\u2019t handle them by yourself.", "YTA - OMG, online school is still work.   If I were her I would lock my room.", "YTA - No means no.", "YTA! It is not your sisters fault, you have three kids. It is not her responsible to look after your kids. If you need a break, hire a sitter. Tell the dad, he has to watch the children, as he is the father. But don't try to make your sister do it, if she doesn't want. I wouldn't be surprised if she will never ever do you any favours anymore after you ignored more than one 'no' from her side.", "YTA! You made the choice to have 3 under 4, your sister isn\u2019t responsible for them. \n\nShe is at home doing nothing, she has online classes! \n\nYou\u2019re a bad sister and a jerk! \nWon\u2019t be surprised if you delete this for not getting the verdict you think you deserve. \n\nYTA", "YTA at minimum for the attempt at emotional manipulation \"If you loved me, you'd do this for me.\"  Add in the clear contempt for her lifestyle choices and you solidly fall in the camp.  I suspect there's more to the tale of why neither of your family are willing to assist.", "YTA. You get no say on how sister chooses to spend her time. You are their mother, and family is never obligated to watch them.  Parents need breaks, but you don\u2019t get to force your kids on others.", "YTA - your the one with 3 kids, not her. she in no way owes you to watch YOUR kids. you need a break? hire a baby sitter instead of trying to force your sister. just because she has \"free time\" does not mean she is required to watch YOUR babies.", "YTA. She doesn't have to justify herself to you or give you what you call a reasonable explanation. Your mother doesn't want to help, but you expect your sister to. How many hours she works and how she spends her spare time aren't relevant. You've got three children, not her. Did you have to justify to her why you chose to have them?", "YTA. No is a complete sentence and she doesn't need a reasonable explanation to decline to help you with your kids. You need to find actual help since your mom and sister don't want to help and not abandon your children with people who don't want to help you. You aren't entitled to anyone's free time, what you did it irresponsible and disrespectful.", "She said no....that should be enough, your kids are your responsibility and yours alone.  You chose this path and you must deal with it and all its consequences.  Your sister is in no way obligated to help you while she's busy furthering her education so she can have a better life than the one you chose.  If you just dump your kids on her and run she is justified in reporting an abandonment to the police.  You need to grow up and raise your kids instead of whining on the internet because you think your sisters life is easier than yours.", "YTA.  You chose to be the mom of 3, not your sister.  It\u2019s one thing to ask, but she has the right to refuse to babysit.  You can\u2019t just leave your kids at her doorstep and just leave, you way overstepped your bounds.  You are not entitled to her time", "yta\n\nshe does not need a reasonable explanation. yes if she offers she can watch them but you nagging her is not going to make her want to.\n\nyou had the kids 3 in 4 years this is on you. no one is entitled to free babysitting or obligated to watch your kids if you want a break get child support and pay a babysitter", "YTA. She told you no. No means no, full stop. End of sentence. It\u2019s not her responsibility to watch your kids. They\u2019re *your* kids. Yes, all moms need breaks but you cannot force *anyone* to watch your kids. You dumped two kids on your sister and took one with you. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a break to me. You definitely crossed a boundary.", "YTA. Your children are YOUR obligation, no one else's", "Of course YTA.  Not her kids, not her responsibility.         If you really loved here, you wouldn\u2019t be upset that she doesn\u2019t want to watch your kids.", "YTA. No one but you chose not to have one but THREE kids back to back with a man who can't be assed to be a father. Would it be nice of your sister and mother to babysit when you need them to? Sure. Are they obligated to do so? Nope.", "YTA\n\nThey aren't her kids and aren't her responsibility. She doesn't need to have a \"reasonable explanation\" for refusing \nand you didn't simply ask her to watch them,  you badgered her and then dumped two of your children on her without her agreement \n\nShe is working part time and doing college classes.  What are you doing? \n\nThe children's father \n\n>decided to go a different path in his life. \n\nDoes that path involve paying child support? \n\nIt IS hard keeping up with the needs of 3 children but *you* decided to have 3 children in 3 years. You need to figure out how to get a little break now and then without making demands on people who don't want to watch your toddlers.", "YTA she said no and you dumped your kids anyway. I'm sure both your sister and your children are very upset with every right to be. How awful it must feel for their aunt being too busy to watch them and their mom being so desperate to get away from them that she'd leave them with someone who already said they cannot give them the attention they need.", "YTA Boy talk about overstepping boundaries! Who do you think you are forcing YOUR kids onto your sister? YOUR kids and YOUR problems are YOURS and not your sister's. If that were done to me I would have been on the phone giving you a choice: CPS or come back and get them! Find some sitters.", "YTA, not for asking but for not accepting her answer of no. She is in school full time plus has a part time job. Being at home studying is no different than a wfh job, it is still working even if she is physically in the home. You say she is home with you, why aren\u2019t you working while caring for your children if you think this would be so easy?   Where is the children\u2019s father? Deciding to go a different path is not acceptable. Does he pay child support? Use that to hire a sitter if you need a break. You decided to have 3 children in 3 years, you need to get used to the idea of having very few breaks for the next 17 years. It\u2019s not your sister\u2019s responsibility to watch your kids.\n\nShe was doing something, schoolwork. You were the one doing nothing. How dare you tell her if she loved you she would do this? If you loved her you would listen to when she said NO!", "YTA\n\nNumber one. You are the AH who decided to have three kids one after another. Is that rough? Yes. Does it have anything at all to do with your sister? No. Does she inherit obligations because you KEPT HAVING KIDS? NO.\n\nNumber two. Even if she is sitting there doing literally nothing, achieving Enlightenment and chanting, that has zero F A to do with you. You do not decide what is worthy of her time. \n\nDoing college online with a job and \"she's home anyway\"? JFC Is there any circumstance in which you respect her? I was going to say if she was taking care of her own kids, would you do the same, and I realized that yes, you probably would have done the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour entitlement to other people's time and complete lack of respect for them is off the chart, even for Reddit.", "YTA. You are a parent, a parent of 3, a single parent of 3. Like it or not you are not entitled to a break. Had she been willing to watch them then that would've been nice, but she specifically told you that she does not want to watch them. She does not owe you an explanation, you should have taken your kids and found a willing babysitter.", "YTA. You cannot force someone to watch your kids. You decided to have three children back to back. With a partner who abandoned his responsibilities. What about his family? Can they help? You don\u2019t have the right to be angry at family members for not helping you raise your kids. You decided to have them. It\u2019s okay to need a break but then you need to hire an actual babysitter.", "YTA\n\nYou can ask, that's not the problem. The problem was when you didn't accept her answer and acted entitled to her time. Then attempted to use manipulation and coercion to make her watch your kids.", "YTA they're YOUR kids and YOUR responisibility not your sister's who works and goes to school. She doesn't owe you free baby sitting because you \"need a break\". Deal with your own kids", "YTA.  You're also lucky she didn't call the police for child abandonment which is what you did. \nShe said NO. You're the one who had 3 children in 3 years. Take BC and get a job yourself.  AH", "YTA  just because she lives there doesn't make her your babysitter anymore than it does your MOM.  Your kids , your responsibility.  She didn't want to, to the point she had to come up with a LIE to get away from YOU.  What you did could also be considered abandonment.   NO means NO.  She doesn't owe you anything.", "YTA.  Your sister didn't decide to have three kids when she was barely out of her teens with some dude who \"decided to go a different path in his life,\" YOU did.   Other people are not responsible for your choices.", "YTA - she has all that free time because  she chose to not have 3 kids. She can do what ever she wants with her free time, including not giving it up to watch YOUR kids. She owes you no explanation to why she may not want to watch your kid. \n\nYou then abandoned your kids to someone who already told you know when it comes to watching them. Youre the asshole.", "Yta.  She has no responsibility to help with your kids. \n\nSo you need to think about going to college too.  Most colleges have reasonably priced daycare programs for students and professors children.  Pick a program with the best opportunities for pay with a work life balance.  Maybe nursing an RN program.  You can sit for the exam and if you pass you work as an RN with only the 2 year program. And get your bachelors after you start working ($ paid for my employer).  Some hospitals even have subsidized daycare options.  Make something of yourself.  You will be happier and will have happier children in the long run. \n\nTake on all BC responsibilities.  You don\u2019t need another child at your young age.", "YTA, felt that half way through. Its not your sister who has 3 kids and her time is hers to do whatever she chooses to do with. If she wants to baby sit others kids, maybe the payment of which is what she makes to get on with her life. Somehow you feel that just because your sister is there, she need to watch the kids. Parenting does not have breaks and you cannot expect someone to want to take care of your kids for free in their own personal time. You mom never wants to help, so why should your sister? They all have their lives to live as well.", "YTA. Your sister did not have children. You did. She is not responsible for your kids. Would it have been nice if she helped? Sure. But she has no obligation to do so. In addition, college, online or not, counts as a full time job. So you\u2019re basically saying she works a full AND a part time job. When she has downtime, of course she doesn\u2019t want to watch a bunch of kids, whom at that age need CONSTANT attention. Total YTA.", "YTA no is a complete answer. She doesn\u2019t owe you help nor does she owe you an explanation. Walking away and leaving your kids with someone who does not want to care for them is an ass hole move.\n\nAnd by the way your mom doesn\u2019t help because given an inch you take a mile.\n\nThey are your kids parent them! Your sister is right you overstepped boundariesZ and if I was her I never watch them again. She also needs to invest in locks so you can\u2019t walk in and dumb your kids on her.", "YTA.\n\nAsking was fine, refusing to take \"no\" for an answer makes you an asshole. Then you have the audacity to ABANDON two of your kids with someone who was not interested in babysitting? You are absolutely awful. \n\nShe is not your servant, and you need to stop being a shitty mom who abandons her kids.", "The fact that you decided on at least 3 occasions to have unprotected sex that resulted in your kids does not mean anyone owes you babysitting.  You made a choice. Now you either suck it up, or you pay someone to babysit. The person who contributed sperm should be the one to parent, and if he won't, he still owes you child support.  \n\nYTA.", "I had 3 kids also when I was 23 I know there were times when I was so tired but you can ask for help but nobody owes you their time to help you.

It doesn\u2019t matter what she does with her time because it\u2019s hers.\n\nIt sounds like your mother never helps which means your sister does sometimes help? Why are you mad at sister and not your mother who never helps?", "YTA - How are you not?  You put your two oldest kids in her room and left the house. Stop dumping your kids on her. This was an ahole move. These are you kids. You chose to have three. Your entitled action is not acceptable. Check out subs where you can learn how single moms find responsible babysitting solutions (e.g., join a group and exchange watching someone's kids and later they watch yours).", "YTA--- So you tried to manipulate her by saying \" If you really loved me you'd this for me\"....thats called gaslighting. Get a babysitter.", "YTA - you overstepped her boundaries.  Asking is fine.  Pushing some is even fine, but forcing her to help is not fine.  I sympathize with your situation, but it isn't your sister's fault that you have three young children that need to be taken care of.", "YTA\n\nYour sister wasn't the one who made the decision to have and keep kids.

Using the \"If she loved me...\" ploy is not a good look, either.

Why are you so dismissive of her getting an education? She is also working part-time and it isn\u2019t easy doing that and keeping up with her studies. She is allowed to have some down time too.\n\nYour sister is also trying to do her college classes in a house that has two toddlers and a baby. Little ones make a lot of noise, especially when they are so close in age. Even the most angelic kids will fight over toys, run around laughing or yelling, cry over something. You are doubtless making a lot of noise yourself in the course of caring for your kids. Have you ever stopped to consider what living in the same house as you and your kids is like for your sister and mom?\n\nDoes your mother work? I am assuming she does since you make no mention of her being home. Maybe she is tired and worn out when she gets home. In any event your mother is in no way obligated to help you when you made the choice at a very young age to have three kids so close together. Your irresponsibility is your problem alone, not your mom\u2019s or your sister\u2019s. \n\nYou make no mention of working yourself, and the kids\u2019 father is a deadbeat dad, so your mom (is your dad in the picture?) is providing you and your children with food, shelter, and clothing.

What\u2019s condescending and crappy is your holier-than-thou tone and insinuating that just because people choose to value their own time means that their family members are in sympathetic positions. Like it\u2019s some weird dichotomy where people ALWAYS help each other out or they NEVER do. \n\nPeople aren\u2019t assholes because they don\u2019t want to be coerced into doing shit they don\u2019t want to do. People have the right to dictate how their time is spent, and they\u2019re not assholes for opting not to give their time away for free. I help my sister with her kids when she asks, but she also respects my right to say no, even if she needs a break. She and her husband made the kids. Their care is their responsibility. I am still a person with agency who has the right to say no, and so is OP\u2019s sister. Not her fault OP popped out three kids in immediate succession before she was old enough to rent a car.", "I will babysit my grandchild no questions asked. Just not for other people. I guess I should have been more clearer. I have only watched my nieces 3 times and the are adults.\n\nGrand kids are just like my kids. I will do what ever they need me to do. But I don\u2019t for anyone else.", "Have you offered your free babysitting services to OP lol? Even if they aren\u2019t your family it\u2019s only 2 kids, not 3 so it\u2019s no big deal right?", "So she decides just to leave them with her sister, who was very unwilling to look after them. This shouldn\u2019t have happened at all, she should organise other childcare for a few hours a week", "Who decided to have three kids in three years with a guy with no job who decided to \"go a different path\"?", "They are being truthful..", "For me, a sister who doesn't want to help at all her struggling sister is an ah. It was not the first time, plus she was lying. At least she should've been clear from the start instead of making up excuses. Has op said the sister had helped her once I wouldn't have said she was an ah, but she never did, so she is. You all have also skipped the thing that op had helped economically mother and sister in the past, and none of them tried to help her when she needed it the most, that's crappy behavior, from a sister nonetheless. \n\nOf course, the sister has a right to say no, and op didn't give her that chance. That's why op is also an ah.", "What does just not for other people mean ?", "Did I say she was not an ah or that she was right ? No. So stop putting words in my mouth", "The one who had even helped her family economically. \n\nAnd so ? If your closest family finds herself, I'm a crappy situation, be it her fault or not, you just leave her to rot ?", "Maybe the sister helped with the FIRST child. She might have helped with the 2nd. But 3 kids in THREE YEARS? No. OP needs to raise her children. She is already receiving free housing. She is not entitled to anything!", "I\u2019m going to make a wild guess that the sister was lying precisely BECAUSE OP has never respected her right to say \u201cno.\u201d The fact that it\u2019s a complete sentence and all the reason needed seems to be lost here. \n\nEven if sister never helped before, she\u2019s still not an asshole. Some people don\u2019t like kids. Some people don\u2019t like taking care of kids. Sister didn\u2019t have three kids, so she has zero obligation to care for them. That doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. How well equipped do you think she is for taking care of two toddlers in her presumably not baby-proofed bedroom?\n\nEditing to add, helping people out, whether with time or money, is not purchasing favors from them to be cashed out in the future. OP can choose not to help her family monetarily (which begs the question of how she\u2019s doing so, considering she has three kids by some deadbeat who doesn\u2019t have a job and doesn\u2019t pay child support) in the same way her sister can opt not to babysit at a moment\u2019s notice.", "I don\u2019t baby sit for anyone but my kids. I will walk through fire for my kids or grandkids but for others I am not going to do the same.\n\n\nI have been burned and used by extended family to help them to often.", "Nobody LEFT HER TO ROT! She has a roof over her head, head, electricity and food! \n\nThat's NOT being left out in the cold!", "I see no indication in the post that she has a job and she says that the father doesn't. Meanwhile her sister is in school and working. \n\nAnd she's being given a place to live with no indication she's paying rent, that's not being \"left to rot.\"", "Looking over 2 kids for a few hours in 1 year now it's parenting and raising them ?!?! Where tf do you live to believe this ? \n\nWhere did you read it's free housing ? \n\nMaybe, maybe, maybe... stop assuming. If you want to know if this happened, then ask for more info from op before judging the situation.", "How bas she NEVER respected her no if this was the first time this happened after many times she had asked her ?\n\nWe are not talking about obligation. We are talking about being nice to your family. And here, no one was to anyone. \n\nWe have different opinions, I can't change yours and I won't change mine.", "Yes, I agree. \n\nThat's why I meant that at least sister and mother could've stepped up. \n\nHere, we're not talking about someone who only expected everyone to do as she likes, ops aid she had helped her family in the past and once she actually needed support no one cared to do anything. Imo, that's sad on a whole other level.", "Where do you read that she's not helping economically ?!", "In her comment, she said she helped economically. And has said nothing about the sister helping or not. \n\nThere's no more info on this, so if you wanna know, ask, instead of just assuming. \nI hate how, in this sub, everything gets assumed always for the worst.", "Maybe, maybe, maybe, understand what NO means NO means. It doesn't refer to just sex. It means when somebody tells you they will NOT watch your children, you DON'T dump 2 of them in your room and leave!", "Sister said she didn\u2019t want to do it. That wasn\u2019t enough for OP, so she kept asking \u201cwhy\u201d until sister gave her an excuse. It\u2019s right there in the damned story.\n\nEditing to add now that I\u2019ve had coffee, I\u2019m only guessing because we have no way of knowing for sure if this has happened before. Posters in AITA always leave out the details that can paint them in a negative light, so we may never know. But we do know in at least this instance that OP didn\u2019t respect her sister\u2019s right to say no, and considering she doesn\u2019t see no as a perfectly valid reason on its own in this instance is a pretty good indicator of her belief system.", "I can\u2019t judge the sister. I do watch my grandkid but I have only watched my neices 2 times they are adults.\n\nWhen I say extended family I include siblings. I got tired of only being called when they need something. So they are just\nLike the rest of the extended family in my eyes.\n\nMy husband, my kids (when I say kids I mean there so also, and my grandkids are my immediate family and my only concern.\n\nI got tired early on being used.", "Where do you read that she is? Because the post itself indicates she has no childcare and is at home all day. How is she helping then?", "She said that in the past tense, and only after she started arguing with her judgement. There's no mention of any current job and no way to make having one with with the story she's telling about neither mom or sister being willing to ever help. So that doesn't add up."]}
