She could have called the cops and you would have been charge with children abandonment.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is right.

Why do you feel entitled to everyone around you shifting their lives around to accommodate your need to have \u201cme\u201d time?  Your children are your responsibility. Your sister does not need a reason or an excuse for why she doesn\u2019t want to watch your kids for you.

She has college lessons, and probably homework to do.\n\nIf you had asked once, then dropped it when she said no, that would have been fine, but you not only pushed the issue, you *forced* her to do it by leaving two of the kids with her.", "Look, as a single mom, I know the level of frustration and exhaustion you are feeling. However, that doesn't entitle you to force those children on anyone else. You can hope your family helps, but they don't have to. You do not have a right to free child care even if she did nothing but watch TV all day. \n\nGood rule of thumb for me, if I wouldn't do it to a friend, I shouldn't do it to family.

On top of that, she works about 15hrs/wk. \n\nYou made the decision to have 3 children. That was YOUR CHOICE! You don't get to demand your sister provide you with unpaid labor. If you need time off, find a babysitter and PAY THEM!", "YTA.\n\nI can understand your pain and there's no harm in asking but you should've stopped when she said no. You don't need a good reason as to why someone can't do something for you and you certainly shouldn't have dumped your two kids off on her after she clearly said no.\n\nNo one is going to want to help you when you pull shit like that. \n\nAlso the father deciding to \"go on a different path in life\" is bullshit. He still needs to be held accountable here. These are his kids too. What are you doing about that? At the bare minimum, he should at least be paying child support here.", "YTA, you made em, you take care of them. Track down that deadbeat dad, make him pay you child support and you can hire a sitter every once in a while for a break.", "YTA \n\nWhen she says no then you drop it, she doesn\u2019t need to justify herself to you.\n\nYou chose to have 3 kids and now you have to suck it up and deal with parenting them. Even if she was unemployed and not studying she doesn\u2019t have a duty to watch your children. Dumping them in her room was not okay.", "Also, if you don't push people for an explanation they won't make one up.  She didn't *lie*.  \nYou were browbeating her and she was trying to get you to stop.", "YTA. That you're a mum of 3 isn't her problem. She doesn't need a reason to say no to you, you're not entitled to her as your on-demand babysitter.", "YTA for feeling entitled to free childcare. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to ask but she said no, period. Your kids are nobody\u2019s responsibility but yours.

No one owes you free child care.  Full stop.  You are going to be lucky if your sis doesn't call the cops on y9u next time.", "YTA. Not for asking if she would, but by forcing her to even though she said no. \n\nLook, I\u2019m a parent of two young kids. I get how hard it can be and how you can really get burnt out. That\u2019s no excuse to leave them with someone else when they don\u2019t agree to watch them. If you need help, look into enrolling your children in early headstart (free if you they are on an IEP or if you qualify for WIC) or seeking out a part time babysitter. We all need breaks sometimes. But responsible adults plan for those breaks and make them happen in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt others.", "YTA, they\u2019re your kids not your sisters \nNot her fault the dad is out the picture and not her responsibility to take care of your kids either\nForcefully throwing the responsibility of taking care of 3 kids is weird too", "YTA.....who gets pregnant with 3 kids all a year apart in age? Have you never heard of birth control?  They're your kids, you are solely responsible for them. Next time choose your partners better....", "YTA, not her monkeys, not her zoo. I'm a mom of 3 as well, I have zero help from anyone. I chose to have them so it's on me to raise them. I also have no help from their dad.

She didn\u2019t. Parenting is hard don\u2019t get me wrong I totally understand needing a break sometimes. But no one else is obliged to give you that unfortunately. I don\u2019t see where you offered to pay her for her time? You tried to emotionally blackmail her by saying if she lived you she would. And then even though she repeatedly said no you dumped two of your kids on her anyway and left. \n\nYou are owe the sister and both kids an apology to be honest.", "YTA. Unless sister is the dad you have no case here.", "Don\u2019t get how people don\u2019t understand nobody else is responsible for watching ur children.

What on earth? Reasonably you shouldn\u2019t have had so many dang kids if you couldn\u2019t take care of them. You have to ask. Or pay. Both, really.", "Yta\n\nYou can ask, she can say no. \n\nYou were n a h at beginning until you kept digging after she said no. She doesn't owe you a reason, and she doesn't owe you child care. \n\nBeing a parent is stressful, but it's also a choice you made, because you have 3 children. One can be an accident, any kids after that are a choice you knowingly made.\n\nEdit to add- I completely missed the part where you full out abandoned your children... I wish there was a level above yta to judge you. She could have called the police on you for child abandonment, because you abandoned your children.", "YTA.  These are not her kids.  They are YOUR kids.  And yes, raising 3 kids on your own is hard but that was a choice you made - not your sister.", "YTA for not listening when she said no then abandoning two children with someone who refused to watch them. You\u2019re lucky she didn\u2019t call cops on you. \n\nYou\u2019re also an asshole for acting like being a college student and working 15 hours a week does not equate to a full time job. Experts say that to be successful in college you need to spend 2-3 hours per week studying for every credit hour (some say 3 hours for STEM courses and 2 hours for the rest). \n\nMost students take 15 credit hours, so that\u2019s 45-60 hours per week plus another 15 at her job. Even if she was taking only 9 non-stem credit hours, that\u2019s 27 hours for school plus 15 for work. \n\nYour sister is most likely working very hard right now. I\u2019d bet she\u2019s stressed out and exhausted.

It is not your sisters fault, you have three kids. It is not her responsible to look after your kids. If you need a break, hire a sitter. Tell the dad, he has to watch the children, as he is the father. But don't try to make your sister do it, if she doesn't want. I wouldn't be surprised if she will never ever do you any favours anymore after you ignored more than one 'no' from her side.", "YTA! You made the choice to have 3 under 4, your sister isn\u2019t responsible for them. \n\nShe is at home doing nothing, she has online classes! \n\nYou\u2019re a bad sister and a jerk! \nWon\u2019t be surprised if you delete this for not getting the verdict you think you deserve. \n\nYTA", "YTA at minimum for the attempt at emotional manipulation \"If you loved me, you'd do this for me.\"  Add in the clear contempt for her lifestyle choices and you solidly fall in the camp.

You are their mother, and family is never obligated to watch them.  Parents need breaks, but you don\u2019t get to force your kids on others.", "YTA - your the one with 3 kids, not her. she in no way owes you to watch YOUR kids. you need a break? hire a baby sitter instead of trying to force your sister. just because she has \"free time\" does not mean she is required to watch YOUR babies.", "YTA. She doesn't have to justify herself to you or give you what you call a reasonable explanation. Your mother doesn't want to help, but you expect your sister to. How many hours she works and how she spends her spare time aren't relevant. You've got three children, not her. Did you have to justify to her why you chose to have them?", "YTA. No is a complete sentence and she doesn't need a reasonable explanation to decline to help you with your kids. You need to find actual help since your mom and sister don't want to help and not abandon your children with people who don't want to help you. You aren't entitled to anyone's free time, what you did it irresponsible and disrespectful.", "She said no....that should be enough, your kids are your responsibility and yours alone.  You chose this path and you must deal with it and all its consequences.  Your sister is in no way obligated to help you while she's busy furthering her education so she can have a better life than the one you chose.  If you just dump your kids on her and run she is justified in reporting an abandonment to the police.  You need to grow up and raise your kids instead of whining on the internet because you think your sisters life is easier than yours.", "YTA.  You chose to be the mom of 3, not your sister.  It\u2019s one thing to ask, but she has the right to refuse to babysit.  You can\u2019t just leave your kids at her doorstep and just leave, you way overstepped your bounds.

I'm sure both your sister and your children are very upset with every right to be.

If that were done to me I would have been on the phone giving you a choice: CPS or come back and get them! Find some sitters.", "YTA, not for asking but for not accepting her answer of no. She is in school full time plus has a part time job. Being at home studying is no different than a wfh job, it is still working even if she is physically in the home. You say she is home with you, why aren\u2019t you working while caring for your children if you think this would be so easy?   Where is the children\u2019s father? Deciding to go a different path is not acceptable. Does he pay child support? Use that to hire a sitter if you need a break. You decided to have 3 children in 3 years, you need to get used to the idea of having very few breaks for the next 17 years. It\u2019s not your sister\u2019s responsibility to watch your kids.\n\nShe was doing something, schoolwork. You were the one doing nothing. How dare you tell her if she loved you she would do this? If you loved her you would listen to when she said NO!", "YTA\n\nNumber one. You are the AH who decided to have three kids one after another. Is that rough? Yes. Does it have anything at all to do with your sister? No. Does she inherit obligations because you KEPT HAVING KIDS? NO.\n\nNumber two.

You are a parent, a parent of 3, a single parent of 3. Like it or not you are not entitled to a break. Had she been willing to watch them then that would've been nice, but she specifically told you that she does not want to watch them. She does not owe you an explanation, you should have taken your kids and found a willing babysitter.", "YTA. You cannot force someone to watch your kids. You decided to have three children back to back. With a partner who abandoned his responsibilities. What about his family? Can they help? You don\u2019t have the right to be angry at family members for not helping you raise your kids. You decided to have them. It\u2019s okay to need a break but then you need to hire an actual babysitter.", "YTA\n\nYou can ask, that's not the problem. The problem was when you didn't accept her answer and acted entitled to her time. Then attempted to use manipulation and coercion to make her watch your kids.", "YTA they're YOUR kids and YOUR responisibility not your sister's who works and goes to school. She doesn't owe you free baby sitting because you \"need a break\". Deal with your own kids", "YTA.

AH", "YTA  just because she lives there doesn't make her your babysitter anymore than it does your MOM.  Your kids , your responsibility.  She didn't want to, to the point she had to come up with a LIE to get away from YOU.  What you did could also be considered abandonment.   NO means NO.  She doesn't owe you anything.", "YTA.  Your sister didn't decide to have three kids when she was barely out of her teens with some dude who \"decided to go a different path in his life,\" YOU did.   Other people are not responsible for your choices.", "YTA - she has all that free time because  she chose to not have 3 kids. She can do what ever she wants with her free time, including not giving it up to watch YOUR kids.

Youre the asshole.", "Yta.  She has no responsibility to help with your kids. \n\nSo you need to think about going to college too.  Most colleges have reasonably priced daycare programs for students and professors children.  Pick a program with the best opportunities for pay with a work life balance.  Maybe nursing an RN program.  You can sit for the exam and if you pass you work as an RN with only the 2 year program. And get your bachelors after you start working ($ paid for my employer).  Some hospitals even have subsidized daycare options.  Make something of yourself.  You will be happier and will have happier children in the long run. \n\nTake on all BC responsibilities.  You don\u2019t need another child at your young age.", "YTA, felt that half way through. Its not your sister who has 3 kids and her time is hers to do whatever she chooses to do with. If she wants to baby sit others kids, maybe the payment of which is what she makes to get on with her life. Somehow you feel that just because your sister is there, she need to watch the kids. Parenting does not have breaks and you cannot expect someone to want to take care of your kids for free in their own personal time. You mom never wants to help, so why should your sister? They all have their lives to live as well.", "YTA. Your sister did not have children. You did. She is not responsible for your kids. Would it have been nice if she helped? Sure. But she has no obligation to do so. In addition, college, online or not, counts as a full time job. So you\u2019re basically saying she works a full AND a part time job. When she has downtime, of course she doesn\u2019t want to watch a bunch of kids, whom at that age need CONSTANT attention. Total YTA.", "YTA no is a complete answer. She doesn\u2019t owe you help nor does she owe you an explanation.

It doesn\u2019t matter what she does with her time because it\u2019s hers.\n\nIt sounds like your mother never helps which means your sister does sometimes help? Why are you mad at sister and not your mother who never helps?", "YTA - How are you not?  You put your two oldest kids in her room and left the house. Stop dumping your kids on her. This was an ahole move. These are you kids. You chose to have three. Your entitled action is not acceptable.

You were.\n\nIt is your responsibility to figure out childcare arrangements. If no one wants to volunteer and help, then you go and pay a babysitter to take care of your kids.\n\nYou can't just stop being responsible for your kids because you didn't feel like doing it for the day or because you \"needed a break.\" You are very lucky that no one called law enforcement for child abandonment on you.\n\nI'd be more sympathetic if this were an emergency medical situation that left you totally incapacitated and with no other choice, but this was not your case.

Using the \"If she loved me...\" ploy is not a good look, either.

You could offer her some money? That way she benefits from it too.\n\nEdit: I don't think the sister was an AH for refusing to babysit.

Online college courses are no joke - your sister still has to attend lectures, complete assignments, and study, just as though she was taking the class in person. Why are you so dismissive of her getting an education? She is also working part-time and it isn\u2019t easy doing that and keeping up with her studies. She is allowed to have some down time too.\n\nYour sister is also trying to do her college classes in a house that has two toddlers and a baby. Little ones make a lot of noise, especially when they are so close in age. Even the most angelic kids will fight over toys, run around laughing or yelling, cry over something. You are doubtless making a lot of noise yourself in the course of caring for your kids. Have you ever stopped to consider what living in the same house as you and your kids is like for your sister and mom?\n\nDoes your mother work? I am assuming she does since you make no mention of her being home. Maybe she is tired and worn out when she gets home. In any event your mother is in no way obligated to help you when you made the choice at a very young age to have three kids so close together. Your irresponsibility is your problem alone, not your mom\u2019s or your sister\u2019s. \n\nYou make no mention of working yourself, and the kids\u2019 father is a deadbeat dad, so your mom (is your dad in the picture?) is providing you and your children with food, shelter, and clothing. That certainly qualifies as helping! \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for needing a break now and then. But you need to figure this out.

At some point you are going to have to be able to care for yourself and your kids on your own. Do you have any marketable skills? \n\nAnd if you ever ask your mom or sister to look after your kids, be respectful of their time. Don\u2019t expect them to drop everything at the last second. Ask well in advance. Ex.: \u2018I have a doctor appointment next Thursday and I\u2019d rather not have to take the kids with me.

She can 100% sit in her room and watch tv if she so pleases while they scream,it'd still be a you problem exclusively. Not to judge or anything but 3 kids back to back with no baby daddy no house of your own or anything substantial to suggest you have a plan on how to push through raising 3 kids independently is kinda worrying. And all this by 23? I've never been in your shoes and I honestly hope you make it work but you sound irresponsible which might have to do with your mom's refusal to cater to your demands. How about you start being grateful to her for letting you and your 3 kids stay at her home? Choosing to live with 3 babies must be quite exhausting and stressful for everyone, especially when you're not particularly drawn to them like your mom & sis. Your sister probably realizes the dependency you have on your family and understandably wants no part in it. Good for her, you need to respect her boundaries and leave her alone. It's hilarious how you judge her for \"barely working\" or \"staying at home 75% of the time\" cause she could literally do the same considering your situation\ud83d\ude02 please grow up and stop feeling like you deserve everyone's help and attention just because you have kids.

I am living with my mom temporarily while working full time. My sister (who works maybe 3hrs a week?) has dropped her 1.5year old son for nearly a week every month for the past few months. She and her partner complain they're on deadline and can't do work, but somehow I don't figure into the equation? The one time I managed to push back she was in tears and also pulled the \"if you cared about me, you'd do this for me\" card.", "Well, to be fair, their mom is also actively avoiding watching them so... likely just another day at the playpen for the poor kids.\n\nAnd in case it also needs to be added\n\nOP? You're *merely* TA, if you acted like a AH to just your sister. But you went for gold medal status of being just the crappiest AH on the playground because you did it with your *BABIES.*", "agree.  I had 2u2 15 years ago and was full time til the oldest was 3.  Dad and I worked opposite schedules and didnt need childcare.  after oldest was 3 then sahm that worked part time while dad took over full time work. I found mom friends and my bestie and I helped each other out with our kids.  You find and develop healthy routines and systems that work for your families unique needs.  right now, op is coasting and not doing anything to change her situation.  She needs to takea breath, get her \ud83d\udca9together and either take college courses from home too, get a job, and become independent.  Im thinking shes going to try and find a new relationship, only to end up becoming dependent on him and/or making things worse for her and her kids.", "Thank you for sharing your experience. People don't realize this type of abuse happens. Unless you have lived it or worked in the system, people don't realize how bad it is.", "One of my middle school friends had 4 by the time she graduated HS (or more likely - would have graduated). There was basically no sex at at the school(s) we went to and she was just one of many teen moms.", ">Your sister could not work at all and spend her days hula-hooping and she still would not be responsible for your kids.\n\nThis made me laugh. Also, I agree, obviously.", "Sounds unfortunately real. Might sound mean, but OP, you made your bed now You get to lie in it. Working 15 hours a week while going to college full-time is pretty exhausting. I worked 20 hours a week while doing my Masters and it was quite excruciating. I barely had time left to sleep after classes, work, and assignments. The classes being online doesn't make them any easier. Just because she is home doesn't mean she is free and not doing anything. You seem to be very entitled. Your choices are yours and only yours to bear. You are the one who chose to have 3 kids by the age of 22. It is your and only your job to take care of your children. You don't get a break just because you want one. It sucks that the other parent is MIA, but no one forced you to have 3 kids so young and so close together. There are certain decisions in life that you can not back out from; babies are such decisions. OP is the AH.", "Same , had 1 at 18. It\u2019s hard , why the fuck have 2 more? I don\u2019t even understand why people , any people , even rich people would want more than like 2 or 3. That\u2019s a shit ton of emotional labor , never mind the finances .", "Yeah, I'm 29 and have never even had a pregnancy scare let alone a whole ass pregnancy and I have been sexually active since I was 16. Birth control and condoms actually do work when you're serious about not having any babies.", ">She really thought she could trap that baby daddy\n\nThe baby daddy had a choice in the matter. He could have used a condom or abstained. But since he didn't, he should take responsibility for his children.", "You know, on one hand we're always telling mothers to speak up if they need help or a break.   \n\nOn the other hand, so many of these new moms seem to think parenting isn't a 24/7 job and they are entitled to breaks and 'me-time'.    \n\nFor all you young whipper snappers out there, parenting is serious business.  Don't do it for social media likes", "I noticed how both the father and her mother opted out of childcare but op doesn\u2019t call them out", "I honestly wish there was a parenting license that was required to have kids. Come puberty give every teen long-term but not permanent birth control and then require some kind of minimal requirements to have the birth control removed. Like something as minimal as \u201cgo online, enter in your info and book an appointment to have it removed\u201d would deter a good chunk of accidental pregnancies during the teen years. \n\nIdeally I\u2019d have a lot stricter rules, but alas even I can see the potential for weird fascist madness.", "Whatever money OP has probably needs to go to the kids, with good reason. \n\nShe's nasty, though, looking down on her sis who \"barely works\"! Sis is working part time and studying, it's her life. She's not supposed to babysit!\n\nIt's messed up because clearly OP's mother wants nothing to do with it and I guess it might also stem from watching her youngest just churning out kids with some dude who bolted just \"because\"! Sis is trying to get herself sorted with uni so she can have better chances of employment and then there're these three young'uns she's being pushed to look after, all because OP couldn't have made some better choices....\n\nHell, I'd be looking into moving out if I was in such a situation!", "Florida man/women is a product of Florida open records law. It's just so easy to find idiots there versus a place where your mugshot isn't posted on the county sheriff websites.\n\n Florida figures if you committed a crime your name and story deserve to be mocked.", "I wouldn\u2019t hold Irish reproductive law 10-20 years ago in any good light. We just had to fight to get an abortion ban lifted from our constitution, while women were dying with non-viable fetuses going septic in their bodies (the most famous case was Savita Halappanavar). Women were being sectioned in hospitals to stop them taking meds that would save their lives because the medications could be harmful to the fetuses. The 8th amendment that allowed that court-ordered sterilisation was an abomination.\n\nI understand that courts should have a way to intervene, like offering sterilisation for free (it\u2019s quite expensive), considering contempt agreements (having another child would be contempt of court), supervised & incentivized birth control medication agreements, or other ethical agreements, but forced surgery, like forced pregnancy/birth, should never be considered a legal option.", "I wholeheartedly agree with you about everything you said about Irish law and I wasn't implying that Irish reproductive law is some bastion of goodness we should all aspire to. More like there was this one case where this thing happened which I thought was good. And it hasn't turned into a landslide of forced sterilisations.\n\nThe only thing I will respectfully disagree on is your last point. If you birth 20 kids who you abused and got taken away from you, and plan to continue doing the same, you should have that ability taken away from you. Courts judge whose rights are more important, and in this case I think the hypothetical child's right to not be born with FAS and be neglected etc wins."]}
