There's another note saying \"Let's keep the refrigerator organized!\".\n\nAt first, I chalked it up to her being particular, and let it slide.

Her passive aggressive post it notes are obnoxious. I can't believe you didn't throw them away earlier, you have an admirable amount of self restraint. She's your roommate, not your boss, not your parents and it's your home too.", "NTA. Tell her removing and trashing the notes is your own \u201clittle quirk\u201d", "NTA. Bonus points for having more maturity than I would\u2019ve had because I definitely would\u2019ve posted obnoxious ones back. My one question though - did you not throw them out as you received them? Why keep them around the house at all?", "NTA. Tell her to use her big girl words and have face to face conversations about issues that really matter and to stop trying to control you on issues that don't. She sounds like an immature nightmare of a roommate.", "NTA.\n\nThere is something wrong with Jenny.  Power through it until the lease ends, and then find a new living situation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou were fine to remove them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven better: Stick them to her room door, and write: \"Remember, no sticky notes in the common areas!\" on each of them. If it is to tedious, have a red stamp made for it. That will be a fun game, getting back at her like in a dystopic 80s scifi movie.", "NTA. You already tried to address this with Jenny directly and she disregarded your feelings. Assuming she writes the sticky notes for you and not just to remind herself, why does it matter that you threw them all away? If she would like things done in a particular way, she needs to use her words and have an adult conversation with you.", "NTA but you missed an opportunity to start writing notes back.\n\nInstead of you throwing them away, she should have come home to the entire apartment covered in post-it notes.", "Maybe the notes are written to herself. Maybe she would be a total mess without them. NTA either way. I'd lose my shit if there were notes all over my house telling me to be quiet and clean the toilet.", "I'm not sure how she would think you are the inconsiderate one, when she seems to want to micromanage your entire life. Does she honestly think that \"keep the noise down\" after she knew you had a rough day was in any way kind or helpful? You tried to have a talk with her about this once, and she brushed it off before resuming the behavior. It's fine if she likes leaving notes as reminders or to keep you informed (\"Hey, just fyi I got called in to work last minute so I won't be home for dinner\") but if, say, she feels like the toilet isn't being cleaned or that the fridge is messy, she needs to just talk to you about that. \n\nAlso, did she really think those notes were permanent fixtures in the apartment? What would happen when the entire place is wallpapered in Post-Its?\r  \n\r  \nNTA", "Info Do you leave the toilet dirty? Do you let the fridge get messy? Are you too noisy?\nAre there real problems that you might not see? Or is she writing notes about something thats not a problem at all?\nHave you already talked about such little problems that can make living together hard for the more sensitive roommates? Or does those notes come out of the blue?", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH a bit. \n\nObviously constantly leaving notes and policing your actions is annoying. But I can see how if she organizes the fridge and then you come back and just throw things in that can be kinda annoying to. It does seem like she is annoyed with you a bit and she should probably have it out with you rather then leaving passive aggressive notes. But like is there a reason she is telling you to keep it down, are you coming in and blasting music when you have rough days. \n\nIt does seem like maybe you are lacking some introspection about how your behavior might be apart of this.", "~~Are the notes addressed to you? She~~ *~~might~~* ~~be leaving notes for herself. And why she wouldn't have warned you about that quirk, I don't know. But the passive aggressive note leaving should also be on the \"warn future roommates\" list.~~\n\n~~If she is leaving those little reminders just for you,~~ I agree, trash them all! Your every action doesn't need to be micromanaged by a roommate. If she's upset about something, she can talk to you.
