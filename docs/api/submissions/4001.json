I would of course explain when they were younger that some kids are raised by same sex couples, or by family member's, or non-biological parents or family member's but as long as they are good parents that is what matters most and to never judge a family by it's cover. I would just wait till they are older and their brains are more developed so they can fully understand what I am telling them.
