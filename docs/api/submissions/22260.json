Since you are not asking for gas money, I think it would be super appropriate to just say something along the lines of-\n\nI am super happy to drive 4 others since I won't be drinking, and in lieu of asking for gas money, how about I just don't chip in for Uber costs? \n\nThat way it's out of the way/understood already. Smart of you to figure this out before you go! Have fun!", "Idk this is a group event and you're the only one making it about you...", "INFO: how does the winery thing work, like does a table accommodate a certain number of people and wine comes with it? Or do you pay for the table and then buy wine separately? And is there just wine or is there also cheese, etc?", "You agreed to go, despite knowing it would involve drinking. Either go and accept the costs of going places or bow out. Edit: Except for Uber, but that should be obvious.", "I think you should pay for the table - it's for the Bride, it'd technically an activity, and you agreed to go knowing you don't drink. NTA for not wanting to pay for the Ubers.", "NAH. \n\nYou aren't \"wrong\", but I also understand the logic here.  Essentially it seems you could drive half the people, and the other half (or however many) would have to uber.  To me it seems understandable to just say \"Lets just split the costs evenly\".   Because then you start really getting into nickel and diming about who owes what.   Sometimes for group stuff like this, especially when everyone is friends, it makes sense to just split things evenly.   \n\nSo are you wrong?  No.  Would you come across as kind of cheap? \n\nAlso, big events like this are a pain in the ass for the organizer.  I've been the organizer many times, and its just so much easier to tally up all costs and split evenly than trying to figure out the minutiae of what exactly each person owes.", "NTA for not wanting to split the Uber, but YTA for not splitting the cost of the activity.", "Slight YTA. I can understand saying Hey I\u2019m driving using my car and gas I paid for to drive one car. I shouldn\u2019t be calculated into the Uber split cost. As for the winery, it\u2019s not per individual drink and since you will be sitting there you should be a part of that calculation.", "NTA - You shouldn't have to split the Uber. I think the best way is to have bride ride with you and then alternate the other seating. The way that the group minus you and the bride handles the uber from there is up to them. The winery thing though you should probably go in on. It's activity that the bride wants to do and being the bridesmaid you should participate in the cost of that.", "NTA, you contribute by driving and you don't ask them to chip in for fuel, so they shouldn't ask you to chip in for Uber. It's reasonable that the rest of them split uber, coz not everyone can be seated in your car\n\nChipping in for activity seems logical, regardless of you drinking coz it's an event for the bride", "NTA. You are providing chauffeur services and the wear and tear (and gas?) of your car. Why on Earth should you also pony up any money for a second car for any of them? They should be reimbursing you! And no, you should not be chipping in for the table fee for the winery or any other drinking establishment either (unless they are also serving food or juice).", "Based on my experience of how bachelorette parties work, you agreed to go and should pay your share of the total cost. Usually everyone chips in for everything (i.e. if you are doing a weekend and paying for groceries, you wouldn't say \"oh I'm a vegetarian and didn't eat the chicken please take that off my bill\" you'd just split everything). \n\nFor transportation, if there are 8 of you and you can drive 4 other people, that helps part of the group but not everyone. It also would make it more expensive for the other three people than if you were taking two Ubers (splitting three ways instead of four). \nEven though you wouldn't ask for gas money, it is probably most fair for the group to all split the cost of an Uber and all split the cost of gas for your car. \n\nFor the winery, if they don't have a lower fee (or waive the fee) for a DD, you should pay that too, since that means the winery is charging for space more than for wine, and you're going to be sitting at the table. \n\nAll that to say, being a bridesmaid and going to a bachelorette party is expensive, and it's expected that you pay your share when you agree to be a bridesmaid or agree to go to the bachelorette. So yes, YTA.", "NTA. Rather than ask to not to contribute, ask if you\u2019re DDing and gas can be counted as your contribution and split among 7 instead of 8?", "Uber is fair to not help pay for as you will be paying for the gas.\n\nYou will be sitting at the table, even if not drinking. So, that is more iffy. You are paying for the experience and company.", "About the winery it depends. Will they charge you for being there? Or will you guys only pay what you drink? If the former n t a, if the latter y t a\n\nHowever, about the uber Y T A. It's the same think as if you were the only driver. Nevertheless the gas costs for your car should also be shared amongst everyone.\n\nEdit: NTA (justification in the comments)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, the group needs to leave you out of uber payment... unless they are paying you.  :)", "Your contribution is the value of another Uber over the course of the day; it would cost more for them if you drank your share and then you were all equally dividing the cost of that second Uber.

I would still chip in for my portion of the bride\u2019s fees, and then contribute to the table cost if there\u2019s a variable cost (ie more per person due to more wine). If it\u2019s a flat rate, Eg. $100 for a table, whether five people or seven, then I\u2019d pay my way - you\u2019re paying to be in the space with them. You\u2019re getting less \u201cvalue\u201d since you\u2019re not drinking, but if paying a nominal fee to hang out with them isn\u2019t \u201cworth it\u201d to you, then don\u2019t go because you\u2019ll just look like a freeloader.", "I think it would be fair to pay for a share of the winery as its something that if you didn\u2019t would bring the price up for the others\n\nWith the Ubers.

It's an unfortunate downside of being involved in the wedding party. \n\nYou could tally up how much it'd cost you in gas + the Uber and split that evenly between everyone bar the bride (in the UK we always cover the brides costs for hen do). \n\nIf the activities are all booked based on what the bride wanted for her bacherlorette, then you pretty much do have to chip in and split the \"default\" fee for booking said activity, but you can always say you want to pay your add-ons separately as you don't drink, which I think is a fair compromise. \n\nDepending on how close you are to the rest of the group and the cost of gas vs winery, you could always say you'll do the driving for free and pay part of the Uber fee if they're happy to cover your part for the wine. \n\nUS weddings always seem so confusing to me because the bride typically pays for all things wedding (dress, hair, travel etc) and bridal party covers all things hen do and pay for their own accommodation.", "this is reasonable thank u!", "I second this.", "Yes its a fee for the table and they bring out a set amount of wine bottles depending on how many in the group", "yes the wine comes with the table reservation.
