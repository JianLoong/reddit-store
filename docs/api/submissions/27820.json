Just because a dog is up to date on shots and is \u201cconfident\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he will automatically do well in every environment.  Don\u2019t take someone else\u2019s dog to a strange environment, around other people and animals, without checking with the owner!", "I was going to say N A H but I\u2019m going with NTA. If she truly has concerns about her dog\u2019s behavior and/or safety in a public space, she should have told you. Or she should have hired a professional sitter (because they often have additional training). I get her point about asking, but I think it\u2019s really on her to communicate that she doesn\u2019t want her dog at the pet store. \n\nI have a reactive dog who wants to greet everyone and every dog, and he\u2019s very small which means that a large dog could hurt him. I spent a lot of money to work with a trainer, but he still gets way too excited for the pet store. Therefore, I don\u2019t bring him, or bring him on off hours to desensitize him. And to get to my main point: if I need dog sitting, I tell my sitter (usually my mom) not to bring him certain places. Dog training was as much about training me to work with him as it was teaching him new ways to deal with triggers. Other people aren\u2019t as attuned to my dog as I am.", "NAH\n\nI have an enclosed deck at my house. My cats are allowed out on it with supervision.\n\nMy best friend came to visit for a week. Right off the bat I told her that we let the cats out there with us, but that she cannot.\n\nBecause if my one decided to be a jerk I\u2019m not sure she can corral him. And if the other makes a break for it I\u2019m not sure she could get her back.\n\nI absolutely trust her, I don\u2019t trust my cats!", "I'll go with NAH. Your intentions were fine and her bounderies for her dog are fine the only thing was lack of communication at the beginning. Now you know. I'm not comfortable with other people taking my dog out due to the possibility of something happening.", "NTA. If she has any restrictions for her dog, she should tell about them in advance. If she trust you with her dog, than she should trust your judgements. It's impossible to read her mind about any detail. So, ask her to pay professional dog sitter next time.", "NTA. \n\nYou behaved like a normal person caring for a pet. If she wanted you to do something abnormal, she needed to state that up front. I suppose she has the right to make up stupid rules after the fact, but until she communicates those rules she has no right to complain.", "It\u2019s her dog. If she wants you to ask her before you take her dog places \u2026 then ask her. \n\nSince no one here knows the behaviors of her dog there\u2019s no way to judge this. \n\nNAH \u2014 your intentions were fine.

Is OP not supposed to be walking this dog (if the answer is no, respectfully the dog should be removed from the sister)? If so, the pavements are full if animals and people. So are the parks. SIL is cracked. \n\nI dogsit. When I do long walks, I often stop at local cafes for a drink. If I was berated for doing that for a reason that wasn't medical or behavioural for the dog, it would be the last time I dogsat for them.", "NTA, I was expecting this to be my sister's dog was mistreated so I sold him. not I took him out for a little trip.", "I'm gonna have to say *very*  slight YTA. It seems to me like you just didn't know better. \n\nIt really isn't a good idea to bring a dog that isn't yours to a public space with other animals. Even with permission from the owner, the dog could still behave differently if they feel vulnerable. \n\nYour sister isn't crazy for thinking it's risky, it is. I work in a pet store, I've actually split up a couple fights. Sometimes other dogs can be on edge. Whether it be because they just got groomed, or they were traveling, or they just got out of the vet, or they're simply nervous. Stress makes animals unpredictable.\n\nYou don't know what other dogs could be there, or why they're there. They could be stressed and turn aggressive towards your sisters dog. Or your sisters dog could have gotten nervous and turned aggressive, it's a strange place and she's without her owner.", "I don't really have a verdict here. It seems like an odd thing to get upset about. I guess if an incident happened she could be liable so it doesn't seem unreasonable that she would want to weigh in on that. But it does seem like the onus would be on her before leaving her dog with someone to make sure that person has the relevant information about both the dog and her expectations necessary to make such a judgment call, which she did sufficiently do.", "NAH but I would apologize for not communicating beforehand that you wanted to take her dog into a store. Not worth it to be arguing with family over something so silly, life\u2019s too short.", "NTA  \n\nAt least, you found out caring for her dog will not be a good idea in the future.", "Nta", "Malicious compliance ring to ask her every time you take the dog out to potty to say if it peed/pooped when you feed it and how much and how often? or go for a walk or to the park and shopping and visiting friends u get the idea. U don't want to do anything else she disapproves off accidentally I'm sure she will love all the updates while she works lol NTA", "NTA - Tell her why don't you put the dog in a plastic bubble if she is so paranoid about the dog meeting other dogs and people.  You don't have time for her nonsense.  If the dog isn't vicious or bites, there should be no problem taking out normally.  And if she insists that you need to call her first tell her to take him to a kennel next time and stop bothering you.", "YTA\n\nDogs kill people and other animals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not responsible to take a animal to a public place without first ascertaining that the dog will not act inappropriately.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust because there wasn't an issue doesn't mean there couldn't have been an issue.", "In my opinion she is being utterly ridiculous. You weren\u2019t taking her to a dog fight, but to a pet store. If you were given no special instructions then that\u2019s it. Game over . NTA.", "NTA\n\nUh, does the dog have reaction issues that she didn\u2019t inform you of? Because what you did is completely normal. If the dog does have issues and she didn\u2019t bother to tell you then she\u2019s for sure an A-hole that\u2019s important information. \n\nAnyway you were doing her a big favor so tell her to get a different pet sitter next time if she\u2019s going to be rude to you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
