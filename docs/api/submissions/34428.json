They ended up getting fined around $1000 when all was said and done, because after the first offense they still wouldn\u2019t keep their pets out of our yard so we continued to file reports with photo and video evidence. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to not want cats pooping in vegetable gardens or to be stepping in dog poop while mowing the lawn.

First off how would animal control know who's dog Is doing the business.. You'd need proof.. You can't just say of It's this neighbor and then they'll go along with It..\n\nSecond of all you say you brought It to his attention over the last week and yet you say In a comment It's only been going on for a week. \n\nThird.. I doubt a dog Is going In your yard every single time It needs to poop..\n\nFourth.. You say In the first paragraph \"a dog who often wanders Into my yard to do his business\". For one I don't know why you didn't state In the post Ut dug a hole under your fence since wander sounds like It just walked Into your yard.. But you say often then you say It's been going on for a week.. \n\nAlso If this Is real.. In my personal opinion addressing the problem to him only two times Is not enough before u call animal control.. you should've told him that you would be calling animal control.. That would've got his attention and If It didn't then go ahead call em..\n\nWhere do y live where the fine Is $400?\n\nEdit: This Is fake.. Animal control did not tell that man they would take his dog because of that..

But the damage is done, you can\u2019t go back, and I highly doubt this relationship is salvageable. My advice is to own up to your part and ask that he please manage the situation on his end.

That's his property and the dog wasn't aggressive. That's really messed up. Keep down voting you psychopaths. With everything going on right now. Reddit really is full of the worst kind of people. You all would want that dog to go to the pound and potentially get put to death. Taken from it's owner because it pooped in a yard. News flash. Animals poop outside.

Hear a lot of horror stories about dogs being seized and destoyed over minimal shit. My other thing is this. And i find it odd no one else has said it. Why didn't you fill in the hole under the fence the dog had dug if you knew that's how it was getting in? That seems like a no brainer.

He is an irresponsible dog owner.", "NTA", "NTA, and this is coming from a dog owner who has an escape artist. He dug under our fence, we got rods we put in and connected to the chain link as \u201cdig defense\u201d going 2 feet deep. He learned to climb it and we got him to quit doing it by watching him and correcting the behavior. He learned to run and jump over the fence (4.5ft) so, he was put on a line and stake outside. He broke 3 of them, and 3 lines. We had to buy one for a 200lb + dog and a thicker and shorter cord. He hasn\u2019t gotten out since! Yes, a 78 lb white lab did all that lol! \n\nHe\u2019s SUPER friendly, he wouldn\u2019t go far, just to neighbor\u2019s houses for more pets and kisses and he liked to go play with other dogs at their houses\u2026 he broke free once just to roll around and beg the mailman for scratches. He even got picked up by a police officer (small town) and was left at the police station for my husband and I to pick him up and he was all happy and prancing until he saw us and looked sad and disappointed in himself until we cried and gave him big hugs and we got kisses! We have a white lab and Dane mix, and he refuses to break out. He\u2019s just as friendly, but he doesn\u2019t leave our yard, he\u2019s insanely protective. If he doesn\u2019t know you and you\u2019re within a foot of my 2 year old son, he will growl and bare his teeth at you. He won\u2019t hurt you, but he will let you know that is HIS baby.

He could have taken the dog on a leash, blocked the hole or even said \" hey man, I'm sorry,  I'll clean it up and try to keep it from happening again\".  This thing of dog owners blaming others because of THEIR bad pet ownership is getting out of hand. I say this as I look at the two fat dogs that my boyfriend and I have had for 10 years.   I would be mortified if they did this.  Your neighbor is an ass and your life is better because he's not in it.

If he knew about the hole then it\u2019s not great that he left the dog in the yard. I guess my hang up is that I feel contacting authorities should be a last resort. Sure, if the dog was in traffic or attacking another dog then I\u2019d be calling. But for poop? It seems extreme.

As it was we lost hundreds of dollars worth of chickens. Look after your dogs!!", "Definitely NTA. Like really, he wants \"more times to address the situation\"? One warning is more than enough. It's common sense that you need to have your dog fenced off on your property, and some people wouldn't even give one warning for this kind of nonsense.

I'd also consider telling him before you do it again, if not for his benefit then for the dog's, because confiscated animals can end up living miserable lives and it's really not the dogs fault here. Also the pre warning gives him less room to do the mental gymnastics & paint your actions as being unreasonable.", "If you were overreacting, then why did the animal control find them guilty?

I'd also be concerned that my fence wasn't keeping my pup in my yard.", "NTA I'm a dog owner and would balk at the idea of my dog leaving crap in neighbour's gardens without me picking it up immediately. If say you'd brought it to his attention then called animal the same or next day you might have been the AH for not giving him more time but you gave him multiple opportunities. I don't understand why he couldn't have right away filled in the hole and taken steps to fortify the area on his side. Maybe keep his dog inside until he's done. I live in the UK so not sure if it's more common place for US dogs to be kept outside on leads as standard (which I personally think is a cruel practice not sure if it's the case here), but there has never been a situation where my.dog has gone in another's garden without my knowledge can't fathom how that would happen unless the poor thing was neglected to start with.", "NTA . Period..", "NTA. More time? It takes two minutes to walk over, pick up the crap and put it in the trash. Or keep the dog on a leash or otherwise contained.

What was he going to do with more time?  I mean, keep your dog secure, it's called a leash.", "NTA \n\nYou did exactly what you should have done in that situation.

His dog, his responsibility.", "NTA.  Not by a long shot.  You did talk to your neighbor about the problem and he didn't take steps to prevent his dog from shitting in your yard.  You had every right to contact animal control and he totally deserved the $400 citation for failing to control his animal.  Pet owners who let their pets roam around off leash are irresponsible and inconsiderate of their neighbors.  Some cat owners are just as bad when they let their cats roam around destroying other people's flower beds and stalking the neighbor's bird feeders.

And what if we are already booked with something seriously important that weekend like close family members wedding or out of town health appointments?
