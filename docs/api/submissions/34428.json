They were loose all the time and I am lucky that my children didn't get attacked on other occasions. We did call animal control and they were fined, but I ultimately decided not to press charges.

I doubt a dog Is going In your yard every single time It needs to poop..\n\nFourth.. You say In the first paragraph \"a dog who often wanders Into my yard to do his business\". For one I don't know why you didn't state In the post Ut dug a hole under your fence since wander sounds like It just walked Into your yard.. But you say often then you say It's been going on for a week.. \n\nAlso If this Is real.. In my personal opinion addressing the problem to him only two times Is not enough before u call animal control.. you should've told him that you would be calling animal control.. That would've got his attention and If It didn't then go ahead call em..\n\nWhere do y live where the fine Is $400?\n\nEdit: This Is fake..

But the damage is done, you can\u2019t go back, and I highly doubt this relationship is salvageable. My advice is to own up to your part and ask that he please manage the situation on his end.

You all would want that dog to go to the pound and potentially get put to death. Taken from it's owner because it pooped in a yard. News flash. Animals poop outside.

Hear a lot of horror stories about dogs being seized and destoyed over minimal shit. My other thing is this. And i find it odd no one else has said it. Why didn't you fill in the hole under the fence the dog had dug if you knew that's how it was getting in? That seems like a no brainer.

He dug under our fence, we got rods we put in and connected to the chain link as \u201cdig defense\u201d going 2 feet deep. He learned to climb it and we got him to quit doing it by watching him and correcting the behavior. He learned to run and jump over the fence (4.5ft) so, he was put on a line and stake outside. He broke 3 of them, and 3 lines. We had to buy one for a 200lb + dog and a thicker and shorter cord. He hasn\u2019t gotten out since! Yes, a 78 lb white lab did all that lol! \n\nHe\u2019s SUPER friendly, he wouldn\u2019t go far, just to neighbor\u2019s houses for more pets and kisses and he liked to go play with other dogs at their houses\u2026 he broke free once just to roll around and beg the mailman for scratches. He even got picked up by a police officer (small town) and was left at the police station for my husband and I to pick him up and he was all happy and prancing until he saw us and looked sad and disappointed in himself until we cried and gave him big hugs and we got kisses! We have a white lab and Dane mix, and he refuses to break out. He\u2019s just as friendly, but he doesn\u2019t leave our yard, he\u2019s insanely protective. If he doesn\u2019t know you and you\u2019re within a foot of my 2 year old son, he will growl and bare his teeth at you. He won\u2019t hurt you, but he will let you know that is HIS baby.

Like furry toddlers lol. \nSo, you\u2019re NTA, but I do think it would be a good idea to offer him some more time before reporting again, and I think it would be nice to share some ideas on how to contain his dog. \nBUT, nothing is foolproof and it can happen again.

This thing of dog owners blaming others because of THEIR bad pet ownership is getting out of hand. I say this as I look at the two fat dogs that my boyfriend and I have had for 10 years.

Eventually the dog forgets about the hole, and the dirt is hard packed again, and you can remove the stones. Or plant a decent sized shrub in the hole, surround it with paving stones. Eventually you can remove the stones. If the dog digs again, the chicken wire is there. Or, get an ecollar for the dog w'ith the boundary as the fence.
