This confused me since we barely speak to each other at work. However, he was practically begging me to say yes. I jokingly said I would accept if I didn\u2019t have to pay for anything, which he surprisingly accepted. \n\nTwo days before the wedding was the Bachelor party. I quickly learned that Carl invited me there to be the babysitter. I do not drink anymore and I\u2019ve never messed with drugs. These guys were drinking and doing coke like they were auditioning for the Wolf of Wall Street. I tried to control their antics as best as possible. As the night was almost over, we all went back to the hotel. As soon as we entered Carl\u2019s room, he fell face first into the ground and shit himself. A LOT OF SHIT. He then was no longer moving. All of his friends went full panic mode because they thought he overdosed. I checked his pulse (nothing), looked around the room (coke lines galore), and realized I was the outsider. As they freaked out, I quietly left the room and called his fianc\u00e9e (Amanda) about the situation. She said she would handle it and contacted 911. \n\nCarl was brought to the hospital and ended up being fine. However, unbeknownst to me, Carl was a recovering addict and the party was the last straw in trust for Amanda. Carl has been silently trying to tell other co-workers now that I\u2019m a \u201csnitch\u201d that ruined his relationship. Some people believe I\u2019m an asshole for breaking \u201cbro code\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have involved Amanda. \n\nAlso, just for reference, this is the level of which Carl shit himself. \nhttps://youtu.be/ohlW9SbhLzc\n\nI\u2019m too old to care about \u201cbro code\u201d, but I never want to be known as a asshole.

Carl is an AH", "NTA. When addicts are not able to look at their own actions and the consequences of those actions they blame others. He relapsed and used drugs. He nearly OD'd. He broke trust with his fiancee. Bro code? More like enablers. \n\nYou did the right thing, and saved his life in the process. It may take him a while, if ever, to see that. Sounds like he needs some real addictions counseling help or serious NA work. I hope he gets help.", "You're never the AH for trying to get someone help when you think their life is in danger. I'm confused about why *you* didn't call 911 but I understand you were thrown off by being put in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable environment.\n\nNTA", "ESH except for Amanda. They should've been more responsible with their drug use and 911 should 100% be the first number you dial not the fianc\u00e9. But hey at least you took action, sounds like the other guys didn't do shit, and also fuck the bro code she has a right to know.", "NTA You did the right thing to reach out to his wife if you were concerned. He's the one who wrecked his own relationship and he's just deflecting blame.", "No way, NTA. You did the right thing, calling her and her calling 911. Imagine if he died. He\u2019s the one who decided to do drugs, he has to deal with the consequences. Good on his ex wife-to-be for getting out, if this was the last straw.", "Not an asshole for calling Amanda, but YTA for doing that before calling an ambulance for someone apparently in cardiac arrest. You couldn't have known that he would end up being ok, and should have prioritized getting him medical attention ASAP.", "NTA.

Even if you had called 911 instead of Amanda, she would have been notified and the same thing would have happened.\n\nIf you have other people coming up to you, just respond with \"oh, are you talking about the time that Carl fell off the recovery wagon and OD'd on booze and cocaine and I kept him from dying?\"", "YTA for calling the Fianc\u00e9 instead of 911. Not because of snitching or any bullshit but because that delay could have meant his death.", "NTA. For a good couple of seconds or minutes, Carl was dead. You literally saved his life. \n\nNot to generalize, but addicts routinely hate the people who have brought the heat/glare/notice down on their actions, almost always after a near-fatal OD. This subplot even shows up in tv shows. \n\nIf Carl wants to talk about that at work...well he's making himself look about 100x worse than he could ever paint you. I swear, if my coworker I knew vaguely just started talking about how he did so much cocaine he had to go to the ER and could you believe this guy called his ex-fiancee - I would just never be around him again.", "NTA. \n\nHe and his \"bros\" are mad that you exposed his lack of trust for his fiancee and would rather keep his secret that he was a recovering addict than make him come clean. Those bro code people are idiots and think about it like this... If she didn't find out now, how do you think she'd find out when she either finds him overdosed or gets a phone call that he's done so? You saved her a giant heartache and at the end of the day, you didn't break the trust, he did that himself.", "NTA. I'd definitely be telling everyone at work how full of shit he is/was.

Ask them what they would have done in that situation. NTA but Carl sure is.", "NTA. Carl is the one who fucked up, not you.", "NTA - What were you supposed to do, let him die on the floor? You are no more responsible for this mess than the telephone used to call for help.", "NTA for calling his fiancee. Most people would want their fiancee there when they experience an emergency, and you had no reason to think differently. YTA for not calling 911 immediately, though. Seconds can count.\n\nYou aren't responsible for upholding a \"bro code\" that you weren't aware of. You had no idea he was a recovering addict, and you had no idea his fiancee had a problem with his drinking/drug habit. You were not involved in the drug use, so yeah, you're going to want to get out of there and inform someone who was relatively coherent about what had happened.", "NTA\nHe is not your friend.", "NTA - dude could have died and he\u2019s mad that he doesn\u2019t get to be married to a woman he lied to.

Absolutely not. this is on Carl and Carl alone.", "NTA! Instead of being a dick towards you saying you ruined his marriage he should be thanking you for saving his life by calling 911.", "You didn't ruin his relationship.

And that's good. So kinda even.", "THIS. Everything else aside, that decision alone could have killed him.

One of his friends at the party could easily have it, or he was able to get into the guy's phone to find the number.", "This doesn't fall under \"good Samaritan\".  Someone that calls 911 AFTER their friend shoots someone (knowing they had a gun and planned to shoot it) is still an accessory."]}
