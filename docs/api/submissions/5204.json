We even coordinated our college admissions to get into the same school, and managed to get into the same dorm, just a few doors down from each other. \n\nEver since we started college, my friend has been experimenting with all kinds of drugs. I don't know exactly what, because I strongly dislike drugs due to some family members with substance abuse, and do my best to know as little about her experimenting as possible. I've even told her that I don't want to be anywhere near her while she's on anything, as being around people that are under the influence of anything makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, last week she invited me to her dorm which is pretty normal, we're almost always together in one of our rooms. This time though, as soon as I came in she started talking about how she got some LSD from a classmate in one of her gen eds and she was super excited to try it out. I stopped her and reminded her that these kinds of things make me uncomfortable and I didn't want to hear about it, and she said she knew but this was different. \n\nApparently when people do LSD, they're supposed to have a sober friend stay with them, in case things go bad or something, and she wanted me to be her sober person because she trusts me more than anyone. I told her definitely not, there was no way I was comfortable with that, and I started leaving. That's when she started freaking out and told me that she already took the LSD right before I got there, and I had to stick around because otherwise she'd be alone and anything could happen. I said that wasn't my fault and left, despite her begging. \n\nI guess things did go bad, because before long I started getting some increasingly frantic texts from her. Stuff that didn't really make any sense, but was obviously from someone who was panicky. I texted her back that I wouldn't be helping her and then turned my phone off for the night. \n\nI woke up to a ton of texts from her, and I guess she must have texted our other friends because our entire friend group had lit up my phone, telling me that she was in trouble and that I should go check on her. I went through and responded to each of them explaining the situation (they all know my history with drugs as well) and all but one of them said some variation of calling me a dickhead and saying that I should have gotten over it and checked on her, because things were apparently really going wrong for her. \n\nWe were supposed to be doing things together on Christmas break, but ever since this happened I'm only getting one word texts back from her, and she's refusing to talk to me in person. I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but we've never gone this long without talking and I'm really starting to doubt myself.

You were clear that being the \u201csafe person\u201d to babysit her during her experimentation wasn\u2019t something you can do for your own wellbeing. She tried to manipulate you and corner you into doing something that she knew caused you to be deeply uncomfortable by taking the acid before you arrived. Then when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, she set all of your mutual friends against you. That\u2019s on the verge of narcissistic behavior - pushing boundaries, manipulation, sending the flying monkeys in to punish you for not complying with her violation of your boundaries. \n\nI would be examining my relationship with her if this is a regular thing.", "NTA.

Says something about her idea of the friendship.\nYou\u2019re an ah (small) for not trying to replace the sober friend with someone else.  It\u2019s ok that you didn\u2019t stay.  You set a boundary, yes, but sometimes you may need to look outside the box to maintain your boundary and still try to keep dumbass friends from serious danger.\nEveryone else is an AH for dumping on you and not stepping up.  \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you go be her sober friend?\u201d Should be the go-to answer to all of them.", "NTA.

But you also are TA because once you were aware there was a problem you had a responsibility as a human being to help.  That does not mean you had to get personally involved or check on her. You could have alerted a mutual friend, alerted your dorm RA, called your college's medical clinic, alerted campus security, or called 911 for a paramedic.  You had many, many options, but ignoring the situation was not one of them.", "I\u2019m honestly torn her between NTA and kinda TA for not checking in her. I completely understand your stance and boundary you created for yourself when it comes to drugs!! She was an asshole for taking it and just assuming that you\u2019d stay there with her. LSD is no joke. She was in the wrong one million percent!! But part of me feels like you should of checked on her or at least spoke with another friend who could, as her LSD trip could of ended very badly! I get why she\u2019s hurt and not answering your calls now, but that\u2019s the consequences of her own actions!! She should of cleared her plan with your first! Overall judgement is NTA. I hope you can mend this relationship with your friend and get her out of this experimenting phase!", "NTA. Your friend knew your issues with drugs but tried forcing you to stay with her by not asking you before taking the drugs. That's on them 100%. Although, you probably should've called someone to stay with them.", "ESH. She should have waited to see if you'd babysit. However LSD is not a trifling thing and when it goes bad it can go really fucking bad - thinking you can fly, cutting open your arms to remove the bugs, satan is chasing me into traffic kind of bad. That is why a babysitter is highly advised. This girl is such a close friend you went to school together, spend most days together, but when her welfare is seriously in question you walk away. That's not something a good friend does. \n\nYes she put you in a shitty situation. But sometimes friends do that. That's when you find out how good a friend you really are. And you failed. You left your friend in a potentially dangerous situation because you felt uncomfortable. \n\nYou both suck. But you a little bit more so.\n\n*edited cause bad grammar and missing letters*", "ESH: she\u2019s absolute the asshole for putting you in that situation and ignoring your boundaries. \n\nHowever, you actively ignored a friend in a possibly very dangerous situation. I don\u2019t think you would have had to stay and babysit, but you couldn\u2019t have let anyone else know? Not even called 911 and told them your friend is having a bad response to a drug? \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a blatant disrespect for someone\u2019s life and safety that you didn\u2019t even tell anyone else or ask another friend to sit with them, but rather completely ignored them even when you saw that they were having a bad trip. You doubled down and stayed stubborn when you SHOULD have 100% let someone know. \n\nYour friend was over the line on forcing you in that position but your response was just as shitty \u2014 people die from that stuff and you don\u2019t seem to care.", "ESH. She should obviously have asked you before taking the LSD, to just do it and expect you to look after her is wrong. You are also a terrible pick (no fault of yours) to be the sober person, she really needs someone who could help if things go wrong. Having someone with no drug experience and who is drug negative be the person to guide you is clueless. To take LSD and then immediately start a conflict with a friend is a really dumb thing to do, she needs to take a look at her life choices and if she is going to do stuff like this she needs to do it in a safe way.\n\nAfter things had started going wrong I think you should have helped in someway, either in person or by alerting a mutual friend. Your friend was going through a seriously negative mental experience, just because it was her own fault doesn't mean you should ignore her calls for help.", "Gotta go with ESH. Unbelievable what your roommate did to you.  But to ignore her when she desperately needs help was too much. Call another friend in the dorm to help, or even call 911 if you can't  bring yourself to check on her.", "ESH. \nObviously she\u2019s the AH for even asking you, but there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re uncomfortable around drugs. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone expected you to stay with her or not be angry that she asked, but the dynamic in this relationship is tilted. She trusted that you would keep her safe and you had zero desire to keep her safe. \n\nYou did nothing. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell a different friend, campus health or even the RA-who in most universities has training to deal with situations like this.\n\nI want to emphasize again that what she did was stupid and dangerous and irresponsible, and she\u2019s a massive ah for doing this. But it was dangerous. It could have ended horribly. Maybe it did end horribly and she hasn\u2019t told you, yet. \n\nI don\u2019t see you coming back from this because neither of you can trust the other now.", "NTA\n\nAnd this friend of yours fucked up, hard, and i think YOU need to be reconsidering how good of a friend she really is.  She's so focused on getting high that she's intentionally ignored your stance, intentionally lied by omission to make you participate in her activities, and denied your right to consent.  Fuck her, honestly.\n\nAnd all these other friends.  None of them wanted to step up, or call your friend out.  If anyone REALLY gave a shit and cared, they should've called 911 if the girl was reacting that bad.  But nobody did.  All they did was force all responsibility on YOU, despite you having the most reasons not to dirty your hands with this mess.\n\nCall it karma, \"fucking around and finding out,\" or whatever little catch phrase you want- your friend is an irresponsible asshole and tried to manipulate you.  I hope her experience was terrible.  If you stuck around, all it would've done is set a precedent for her to trap you for all her future experiments.  While I'm against drugs in the first place on a personal level, she has no fuckin' business experimenting if she's this bad at planning for it.  \n\nYou two might have a long history and be close, but people change and you 100% made the right choice here.  May want to have a serious talk with her and give your friend some tough love before it's too late- this is the kind of slippery slope that can destroy your friendship and her life.  Protect yourself., as you did here.  Adults can only hold themselves responsible for their own actions.", "ESH she shouldnt force you to be a tripsitter. Youve made your stance on drugs clear, that you dont want to engage with them, but that youre okay with her doing it. She should also choose someone with experience instead of someone who actively distance themself. If shit goes sour, you cant do anything else than get her medical attention, which isnt necessarily the solution.\n\nHOWEVER, the second it started going sour for her, you definitely shouldve gotten her the medical attention.

Why would you not check on a \u201cgood\u201d friend, that feels like she is going die? You say you know about drug abuse, so you assumingly also know what scared people can do while they are experiencing a bad trip. I would not have forgiven myself if i let my friend alone in that state, no matter how angry you are that she put you in that position. You could have talked to her at a later (no drugs taken) time. \n\nIf i were your friend, i would probably second guess my friendship with you, they felt horrible and were in a very weak spot emotionally and you just left them..", "NTA - you checking in would have done nothing and maybe made it worse. I\u2019ve done a lot of LSD, and it makes you sensitive as fuck to the way people are feeling.

She new exactly what she was doing and went against your feelings.\n\nTell her next time she pulls that, she should call the RA to come supervise her.", "NTA, and she's not your friend.  Friends don't do that to their friends.", "NTA, your friend knew how you felt and given you have family members with addiction problems (and it is often a genetic issue) you're doing the right thing keeping away from it. And your friend fully manipulated you into that situation which is wrong. If your other friends are no where near the fear your friend would be hurt will have outweighed the manipulation at the time but I would hope they would realise in time you didn't do anything wrong. And there were dorms of other people around. I would suggest taking a full break from that friendship while your friend is experimenting and making some new friends.", "NTA You ask someone to trip sit you before you take the acid. Your friend is a dumb ass.", "NTA, she sounds very selfish", "Nta. She tried to use you as a baby sitter. Lsd requires a calm environment for exploration. She didn't want to accept your answer so she forced you into an unwinnable situation. She's not a friend and neither are the ones who are on her side. Let this be a lesson kids, don't trip if you aren't 100% prepared ahead of time.", "NTA, she isn't respecting your boundaries.", "NTA. You made a very fair, logical boundary. Taking LSD was a choice. Part of that choice was not that she gets to violate your boundaries. Knowing you're not comfortable in that position she should have either not done it or found someone willing to be sober for her. This was her choice, her consequences, not your fault or wrongdoing at all.", "NTA- she wanted you to babysit her without prior consent. This is not a friendship. I am sorry you had to find out this way. You are entitled to be teetotal on whatever you choose, and its even possible to remain friends with people in drug culture (if you choose). Both parties just need to respect boundries and your friend did not.", "NTA.", "NTA. You stuck to your own judgement and wanted no part of your friend's experimental drug session. Good for you to not give in to peer pressure either.\n\nIt is highly selfish and entitled of your friend to entrap you to witness her fix. Your friend knew your feelings about drugs and disrespected you. Does she really regard you as a friend, as friends don't trick their each other.\n\nPerhaps you should have gone and checked on her when it was frantic, but what's happened has happened. Your friend is giving you the cold shoulder because she messed up and needs someone to blame for not being there. It's LSD this time what if it's harder drugs next time? If things were life threatening and she wanted you to \"watch\", think of the trauma which you clearly wanted no part of.", "ESH", "NTA. You were clear on your boundaries and she FAFO'd it.

It something they have experience with and access to deal with it.", "NTA and that friend was far too immature to be committing to experience psychedelics, you need a specific mindset to be able to enjoy them, and that REALLY should never include anxiety as that's what makes you panic and makes the trip go bad the most frequently.", "NTA,  you can't just spring being the babysitter on someone. That was really fucked up of her.", "NTA. You were very clear about your boundaries, and that this is something that makes you very uncomfortable because of past experience with people on substances. Your friend put you, and herself, in that position knowingly. You protected yourself when she tried to make a choice for you that went completely against the boundaries you had set. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this right now, and I understand that you couldn\u2019t deal with that situation. Her friends who don\u2019t have the same boundaries, who she was clear enough to contact to complain about you, should have stepped up instead of berating you. I do hope this eventually works out, but continue to take care of yourself", "ESH. You setting a boundary is fine and I respect that, but your ex-friend really could\u2019ve hurt herself. The responsible thing would have been contacting another friend to come over before you left", "NTA \n\nShe manipulated you to stay with her while using drugs even tho you\u2019ve been explicitly open about NOT LIKING, AND NOT WANTING TO BE PART OF ANY OF THAT. \nHer consequences are her own", "ESH. She shouldn't have taken anything and expected you to babysit her, but would it really have been that big of a deal to take two minutes to walk over to her dorm and check on her? She definitely disrespected you, but aren't you supposed to be friends? Do you have such a hard line for people drinking alcohol too?\n\nThe only thing you've done is reveal yourself to be a bad friend.", "ESH. It's messed up she basically tried to coerce you into tripsitting. Friendship is about respecting people's boundaries and needs and being there for them for that. \n\n*However*, that also means being able to recognize which needs are acute at the time. LSD isn't going to hurt her just by itself but she could've absolutely been in a state of mind where she hurt herself or someone else. And it's not like you *had* to be party to it, you could've let one of your friend group members know and told them to show up ASAP because you were gone and she needed someone. \n\nNo, it wouldn't have been your \"responsibility\" necessarily since you didn't agree to trip sit or take anything. But it seems really unkind to not even let someone she might be in a rough spot *in advance*.", "That \"rule\" doesnt exist lol, i have friends that have taken that crap and no one was sober, when they want to do that shit i just dont go. NTA. Your friend is a butthole.", "NTA", "NTA- it was really unfair of her to take it before asking you to watch her. I was once put in that position and it was extremely stressful because they were freaking out and Nothing helped her.

There needs to be a plan discussed beforehand.", "NTA your friend is going down a sketchy road. Took illegal drugs and then tried to make you responsible for her. Took illegal drugs, she didn't even really know what they were of (fentenyl anyone?).

Where were all of these \"friends who are mad at you\" when she needed support?", "Once you received so many texts you could\u2019ve just gone and checked up on her \u2026.

Have a trauma reopened? \n\nHaving a sober person with her was a start, but it would have been a waaaay better idea to have someone who actually knows what she was doing and how to care of someone having a (bad) trip. Because things can go hella wrong for the consumer and the accompagnant.", "ESH, very very gently. \n\nYour \"best friend\" tried to force your consent knowing your reservations by taking LSD, a mood-altering drug known for inducing panic attacks and worse if exposed to negative emotions. This is bad! This is, in fact, The Worst.\n\nI also come from a family with substance abuse issues, and so I know your trigger is valid and fair, and you were under no obligation to stay with your \"friend\" to guide her through her trip - it would have been a bad idea because she needed someone calm and happy, and you were neither. From what little I know of LSD, picking up on even microexpressions can ruin a trip and send you to a danger zone, and no one wants that. \n\nYou were (gently) an asshole for leaving her utterly alone during a downward spiral. What you should have done was call paramedics, or a shared friend, or literally anyone more qualified than yourself. You were sober, you are an adult, and you know that there are dangers, even if you might not have known LSD specifically. If she had gotten it from an untrustworthy source, if she had taken too much, she might have *died*, OP, and you left her alone. Your responsibility as the sober adult in that situation was to get better qualified help, which you didn't do. That doesn't make you a bad person, but it was a bad thing to do.\n\nYour other friends, additionally, are assholes, especially if they too were sober and learned about a bad LSD trip. It sounds like no one did anything to help, which sucks. So that's why this judgment, instead of NTA.", "NTA - you could have maybe let someone else know to keep an eye on her but she knew how you felt about drugs so she made her own bed.", "She put you in an uncomfortable situation and thought she \"gotcha!\" by taking LSD before you showed up.\n\nYou left the situation, which was your right. You protected yourself.\n\nHowever, you could have called a mutual friend to look after your friend during her trip. Then, admonish her for what she put you through once she was sober. You didn't owe her that, but it would have been a good precaution.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I would have called someone to help her if you couldnt even just to get her to the hospital.", "NTA you are not responsible for her bad decisions.

Everyone saying e s h and how you're TA for not babysitting her because LSD trips can go bad clearly missed the part where you said you don't care for drugs and avoid them at all costs. I bet you didn't actually know about the fact it can go so bad to be deadly. If she was such a great friend, she would know you are totally NOT good for this, that you probably don't know about LSD and how bad things can go, and thus know you ain't a good choice for it.", "Exactly, why didn't one of these other so called friends go check on her? And OP made her feelings clear, this girl lied to doing drugs before she came over to try and blackmail her into staying.", "Yeah. She tricked OP into taking care of her by inviting OP to what was supposed to be a casual hangout. It's her fault for taking LSD before she was sure she'd have a sober friend present.", "I definitely wouldn't want any of you people as a friend.", "Why didn't OP fix someone else too check up on her?

The friend was definitely ah and very immature to be experimenting with drugs if she can 't organise her babysitter properly.

Like I wouldn\u2019t even be able to sleep at night if I knew something was happening to my friend. And OP doesn\u2019t sound concerned or dismayed at all. Just worried they won\u2019t hang over the break. \n\nI think both OP and her best friend should reevaluate the friendship on both ends from this experience. OP has learned her friend doesn\u2019t respect her boundaries and that\u2019s understandably a reason to be upset. \n\nBut her best friend learned that OP will leave her and ignore her in an emergency if it\u2019s something that she\u2019s not a fan of. \n\nEdit to add: OP you were right down the hall and you didn\u2019t even both to knock!?!

You make God damn sure your environment is safe *before* you drop. Not after the fact with someone with clear boundaries about not being around drugs.", "? It doesn't sound like OP would have known what to do if they were there when things get bad, given their discomfort with drugs. This doesn't sound like it's just about babysitting being boring, this friend violated a clear established boundary tied to OP having basically zero capacity to be around drug use and it sounds like she tried to force their hand by already having taken it before asking.", "I find it interesting that so many NTA comments are also saying \u201cbut\u2026\u201d and don\u2019t see that\u2019s core to the question.", ">I think a lot of the NTA's probably haven't first hand experience with LSD\n\nA lot of them read like they are from people with no first hand experience of anything at all", "This.

Just because she is an irresponsible jerk you don\u2019t have be one. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine turning the phone off. How does experimenting with drug makes them uncomfortable but a friend having a bad drug reaction is fine and she goes back to sleep? \n\nWhy the friend will pick such person to be the her sober companion is beyond me.

Lol", "Yeah I'm sitting here wondering if OP even likes their best friend.
