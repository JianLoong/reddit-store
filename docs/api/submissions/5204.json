We even coordinated our college admissions to get into the same school, and managed to get into the same dorm, just a few doors down from each other. \n\nEver since we started college, my friend has been experimenting with all kinds of drugs. I don't know exactly what, because I strongly dislike drugs due to some family members with substance abuse, and do my best to know as little about her experimenting as possible. I've even told her that I don't want to be anywhere near her while she's on anything, as being around people that are under the influence of anything makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, last week she invited me to her dorm which is pretty normal, we're almost always together in one of our rooms. This time though, as soon as I came in she started talking about how she got some LSD from a classmate in one of her gen eds and she was super excited to try it out. I stopped her and reminded her that these kinds of things make me uncomfortable and I didn't want to hear about it, and she said she knew but this was different. \n\nApparently when people do LSD, they're supposed to have a sober friend stay with them, in case things go bad or something, and she wanted me to be her sober person because she trusts me more than anyone. I told her definitely not, there was no way I was comfortable with that, and I started leaving. That's when she started freaking out and told me that she already took the LSD right before I got there, and I had to stick around because otherwise she'd be alone and anything could happen. I said that wasn't my fault and left, despite her begging. \n\nI guess things did go bad, because before long I started getting some increasingly frantic texts from her. Stuff that didn't really make any sense, but was obviously from someone who was panicky. I texted her back that I wouldn't be helping her and then turned my phone off for the night. \n\nI woke up to a ton of texts from her, and I guess she must have texted our other friends because our entire friend group had lit up my phone, telling me that she was in trouble and that I should go check on her. I went through and responded to each of them explaining the situation (they all know my history with drugs as well) and all but one of them said some variation of calling me a dickhead and saying that I should have gotten over it and checked on her, because things were apparently really going wrong for her. \n\nWe were supposed to be doing things together on Christmas break, but ever since this happened I'm only getting one word texts back from her, and she's refusing to talk to me in person. I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but we've never gone this long without talking and I'm really starting to doubt myself.

You were clear that being the \u201csafe person\u201d to babysit her during her experimentation wasn\u2019t something you can do for your own wellbeing. She tried to manipulate you and corner you into doing something that she knew caused you to be deeply uncomfortable by taking the acid before you arrived. Then when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, she set all of your mutual friends against you. That\u2019s on the verge of narcissistic behavior - pushing boundaries, manipulation, sending the flying monkeys in to punish you for not complying with her violation of your boundaries. \n\nI would be examining my relationship with her if this is a regular thing.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your friend. She knew that you do not want to be around her when she\u2019s on drugs, and she tried to force it on you anyways. Find new friends.", "NTA. She knew you would say no. That\u2019s why she took it before you got there. You have very clearly set your boundaries regarding drugs and she stomped all over them. She could have chosen anyone from your friend group but she chose you on purpose.", "YkindaTA. It could\u2019ve gone pretty bad without a sober sitter. I get your history and all that, but if she\u2019s your closest friend you probably could\u2019ve just stayed.

Says something about her idea of the friendship.\nYou\u2019re an ah (small) for not trying to replace the sober friend with someone else.  It\u2019s ok that you didn\u2019t stay.  You set a boundary, yes, but sometimes you may need to look outside the box to maintain your boundary and still try to keep dumbass friends from serious danger.\nEveryone else is an AH for dumping on you and not stepping up.  \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you go be her sober friend?\u201d Should be the go-to answer to all of them.", "NTA.

But you also are TA because once you were aware there was a problem you had a responsibility as a human being to help.  That does not mean you had to get personally involved or check on her. You could have alerted a mutual friend, alerted your dorm RA, called your college's medical clinic, alerted campus security, or called 911 for a paramedic.  You had many, many options, but ignoring the situation was not one of them.", "I\u2019m honestly torn her between NTA and kinda TA for not checking in her. I completely understand your stance and boundary you created for yourself when it comes to drugs!! She was an asshole for taking it and just assuming that you\u2019d stay there with her. LSD is no joke. She was in the wrong one million percent!! But part of me feels like you should of checked on her or at least spoke with another friend who could, as her LSD trip could of ended very badly! I get why she\u2019s hurt and not answering your calls now, but that\u2019s the consequences of her own actions!! She should of cleared her plan with your first! Overall judgement is NTA. I hope you can mend this relationship with your friend and get her out of this experimenting phase!", "NTA. Your friend knew your issues with drugs but tried forcing you to stay with her by not asking you before taking the drugs. That's on them 100%. Although, you probably should've called someone to stay with them.", "ESH. She should have waited to see if you'd babysit. However LSD is not a trifling thing and when it goes bad it can go really fucking bad - thinking you can fly, cutting open your arms to remove the bugs, satan is chasing me into traffic kind of bad. That is why a babysitter is highly advised. This girl is such a close friend you went to school together, spend most days together, but when her welfare is seriously in question you walk away. That's not something a good friend does. \n\nYes she put you in a shitty situation. But sometimes friends do that. That's when you find out how good a friend you really are. And you failed. You left your friend in a potentially dangerous situation because you felt uncomfortable. \n\nYou both suck. But you a little bit more so.\n\n*edited cause bad grammar and missing letters*", "ESH: she\u2019s absolute the asshole for putting you in that situation and ignoring your boundaries. \n\nHowever, you actively ignored a friend in a possibly very dangerous situation. I don\u2019t think you would have had to stay and babysit, but you couldn\u2019t have let anyone else know? Not even called 911 and told them your friend is having a bad response to a drug? \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a blatant disrespect for someone\u2019s life and safety that you didn\u2019t even tell anyone else or ask another friend to sit with them, but rather completely ignored them even when you saw that they were having a bad trip. You doubled down and stayed stubborn when you SHOULD have 100% let someone know. \n\nYour friend was over the line on forcing you in that position but your response was just as shitty \u2014 people die from that stuff and you don\u2019t seem to care.", "ESH. She should obviously have asked you before taking the LSD, to just do it and expect you to look after her is wrong. You are also a terrible pick (no fault of yours) to be the sober person, she really needs someone who could help if things go wrong. Having someone with no drug experience and who is drug negative be the person to guide you is clueless. To take LSD and then immediately start a conflict with a friend is a really dumb thing to do, she needs to take a look at her life choices and if she is going to do stuff like this she needs to do it in a safe way.\n\nAfter things had started going wrong I think you should have helped in someway, either in person or by alerting a mutual friend. Your friend was going through a seriously negative mental experience, just because it was her own fault doesn't mean you should ignore her calls for help.", "Gotta go with ESH. Unbelievable what your roommate did to you.  But to ignore her when she desperately needs help was too much. Call another friend in the dorm to help, or even call 911 if you can't  bring yourself to check on her.", "ESH. \nObviously she\u2019s the AH for even asking you, but there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re uncomfortable around drugs. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone expected you to stay with her or not be angry that she asked, but the dynamic in this relationship is tilted. She trusted that you would keep her safe and you had zero desire to keep her safe. \n\nYou did nothing. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell a different friend, campus health or even the RA-who in most universities has training to deal with situations like this.\n\nI want to emphasize again that what she did was stupid and dangerous and irresponsible, and she\u2019s a massive ah for doing this. But it was dangerous. It could have ended horribly. Maybe it did end horribly and she hasn\u2019t told you, yet. \n\nI don\u2019t see you coming back from this because neither of you can trust the other now.", "NTA\n\nAnd this friend of yours fucked up, hard, and i think YOU need to be reconsidering how good of a friend she really is.  She's so focused on getting high that she's intentionally ignored your stance, intentionally lied by omission to make you participate in her activities, and denied your right to consent.  Fuck her, honestly.\n\nAnd all these other friends.  None of them wanted to step up, or call your friend out.  If anyone REALLY gave a shit and cared, they should've called 911 if the girl was reacting that bad.  But nobody did.  All they did was force all responsibility on YOU, despite you having the most reasons not to dirty your hands with this mess.\n\nCall it karma, \"fucking around and finding out,\" or whatever little catch phrase you want- your friend is an irresponsible asshole and tried to manipulate you.  I hope her experience was terrible.  If you stuck around, all it would've done is set a precedent for her to trap you for all her future experiments.  While I'm against drugs in the first place on a personal level, she has no fuckin' business experimenting if she's this bad at planning for it.  \n\nYou two might have a long history and be close, but people change and you 100% made the right choice here.  May want to have a serious talk with her and give your friend some tough love before it's too late- this is the kind of slippery slope that can destroy your friendship and her life.  Protect yourself., as you did here.  Adults can only hold themselves responsible for their own actions.", "ESH she shouldnt force you to be a tripsitter. Youve made your stance on drugs clear, that you dont want to engage with them, but that youre okay with her doing it. She should also choose someone with experience instead of someone who actively distance themself. If shit goes sour, you cant do anything else than get her medical attention, which isnt necessarily the solution.\n\nHOWEVER, the second it started going sour for her, you definitely shouldve gotten her the medical attention.

Why would you not check on a \u201cgood\u201d friend, that feels like she is going die? You say you know about drug abuse, so you assumingly also know what scared people can do while they are experiencing a bad trip. I would not have forgiven myself if i let my friend alone in that state, no matter how angry you are that she put you in that position. You could have talked to her at a later (no drugs taken) time. \n\nIf i were your friend, i would probably second guess my friendship with you, they felt horrible and were in a very weak spot emotionally and you just left them..", "NTA - you checking in would have done nothing and maybe made it worse. I\u2019ve done a lot of LSD, and it makes you sensitive as fuck to the way people are feeling.

Which is hilarious looking back on it seeing as we\u2019re literally neighbors. \n\nNow? Now he\u2019s sobered up. He\u2019s trying to get better so he can take care of his mom. He\u2019s also attending college full time. I\u2019m honestly proud of him, he did that on his own, with friends who kept pressuring him to continue spiraling. Eventually, he reached back out to me (needed help with his FAFSA) and we began to mend things from there. \n\nAdvice? Be aware that your friendship has been damaged. You did indeed choose your boundaries over her. She\u2019s hurt.

However, I would NEVER ever force someone to trip sit me without telling them beforehand and getting clear consent. That is super fucked it. I hope that while her trip was bad from being alone, she realized how selfish and inconsiderate her actions were. Nothing better than some psychedelics to make you realize you have to change as a person. \n\nYou are definitely not the asshole in this scenario!

Which is ok, she put you in a shitty situation, but don\u2019t expect to be friends after.\n\nI think this is an easy ESH.  And all the people saying call the cops\u2026.just wow.

That she took the drug before having you cone over demonstrates she was afraid you wouldn\u2019t agree to be her safe person so she decided to give you no choice.  That is on her.  That she did that is only part of the problem. What if her reaction had been so over the top you wouldn\u2019t know how to help.  \n\nYour years of friendship cause you to feel really bad about this coming to an end but it may be a blessing in disguise.  Not all friendships last a lifetime.  People change.  Just assure yourself that she chose to impose all this on you without your consent.  To then be angry that you did not allow her to do that is not an act of friendship on her part.

Going off of the stories I've read here you want a trip sitter that is experienced in calming people under the influence down and having an uncomfortable of even scared trip sitter would ruin the experience for both of them, making it even more dangerous, and probably scaring or traumatizing OP even more.

Beyond abandoning her there are a number of options he could have taken, stayed with her, called mutual friends who could be trusted and have one, or more of them, come to support so that OP could be removed from the situation. To leave, without someone else aware and available, and then turn off his phone (despite knowing there was a problem with his friend) is really shitty thing to do. I  can't begin to imagine how awful and guilty OP would have felt if something had happened to his friend because of his inaction (his fault or not).

For an unenthusiastic tripsitter it's annoying and time-consuming at best. You're literally babysitting a full-ass adult who is on powerful perception-altering drugs for *hours* (LSD lasts a *minimum* of 7-8 hrs). Someone who's never done LSD before can have an *extremely* negative and/or violent reaction to it, and as a tripsitter, you need to be prepared for that possibility. It's not something that just gets sprung on you last-minute because the person doing the drugs was feeling selfish and impatient. \n\nAnd God forbid OP's friend didn't do any research prior, because LSD generally doesn't play nice with other drugs in the system, including many prescription drugs for anxiety and depression. And just because there's no \"lethal dose\" of LSD doesn't mean that it can't kill or permanently harm you: in worst-case scenarios it's known to cause seizures and lasting severe psychosis.

A lot of people who experiment with LSD know that it can be lethal when combined with MAOIs, but don't realize that it's still incredibly risky to mix with other drugs, including SSRIs. Stimulants (like ADD medications) and antidepressants in general both increase the potential for both physical and psychological harm while tripping. So does marijuana, which can exponentially intensify the experience... but that isn't always a good thing, as it intensifies the negatives right along with the positives. And to be frank, taking a drug with known side effects of increased anxiety/paranoia and time dilation alongside LSD is simply not a wise idea. Yes, for some people it works out just fine and they end up having a great time. For many others, it's a surefire way to *guarantee* a bad trip that will, at *best*, totally ruin the overall experience, and at worst will leave you with recurring symptoms of psychosis. \n\nI will also say this: if you suffer from a depressive or anxiety disorder, simply do not take LSD outside of a controlled medical environment (since formal medical experiments using controlled doses of LSD and other hallucinogens to improve certain disorders are on the rise). Do *extensive* research prior and do not disregard the risks just because they're not what you want to hear. LSD isn't just fun colors and groovy vibes, and it's not like certain other recreational drugs where you can just go to sleep or eat certain foods to dull the effects or cut short the high. Once you take it, you're on it, for better or worse, for a minimum of 8 hours (and probably much closer to 10-12). If that thought gives you *any* pause while sober, let me personally assure you that it's not going to be any less concerning to you when you're 2 hours in realizing that you still have upwards of 8 hours to go and there's not a damn thing you or anyone else can do about it.

If you treat the drug respectfully, it's fairly safe.

Going to a restaraunt. Walking down a public sidewalk with a group of friends at dusk. Walking down a hallway with murals on the walls. Watching my friend doing her eyeliner. Seeing a child. Hallucinating that my friend was projectile vomiting and boomer-ranging between hysterical laughter and hysterical sobs. \n\nIt all sounds absolutely hilarious in retrospect. I can assure you it was not funny in the slightest at the time. Everything feels more real than reality when you're tripping, and things can go so wrong *so* fast, with absolutely zero warning. It's like being in a dream, except you can't wake up. If it turns into a nightmare the only thing you can do is grit your teeth and bear it. \n\nAnother part of the problem is that LSD causes pretty severe time dilation. You think 8-12 hours sounds like a long time now? Imagine tripping for 2 hours, feeling like you've already been tripping for 5 hours, and realizing that not only have you not even hit the peak of the trip yet (when the symptoms become the most intense), but you've still got a solid 6-8 hours *minimum* of tripping to go. Even when the trip is good, take it from me, that's not a pleasant feeling. \n\nAnd yeah, if your tripsitter is not a) a trusted friend and b) experienced with LSD, then reconsider the whole thing. People tripping on LSD do not think, act, or experience things the same way that people not on LSD do. Someone who has not experienced that mindset firsthand frankly cannot know how to adequately handle that, especially if the trip goes sour. A good tripsitter can keep your mindset positive and stable, which will (most of the time) keep your trip positive and stable; a bad tripsitter can unintentionally make things very, very bad (which, most of the time, will make the trip itself very, very bad) and be unable to pull you back up.", "That\u2019s what I was going to say!

At around 50 micrograms (a half tab) you hallucinate without losing touch with reality. So it's more like you glance at your hand and think \"neat, the acid is making it look like there's a tiny city growing in between the lines of my fingerprint\" instead of \"there are literally worms crawling through my body and I've spent an aeon being devoured by maggots.\"\n\nThat sort of miserable, PTSD- inducing experience usually only happens at more than 200 micrograms. Acid's effects are very dose-dependant.", "I\u2019m not gonna tell you that you should do acid but I would keep in mind that this kind of thing is heavily stigmatised on regular reddit and honestly if you\u2019re in a good headspace and take a regular dose it\u2019s pretty fine. Horror stories do happen but the one way to guarantee bad shit happening is to be thinking about what could go wrong when taking the drug. I\u2019ve tripped many times and never had a bad experience and I have a large group of friends who all trip at home/festivals/etc and quite literally none of the sensationalised stuff in this thread has happened to any of us. It\u2019s not risk free of course but I would keep an open mind.", "Dropping acid alone is awesome!", "Yeah I\u2019ve done LSD several times and a trip sitter IS recommended but I\u2019ve never heard that that person has to be sober? Usually it would end up there was a person not tripping for some reason but not always. People tripping are usually fine as fellow tripsitters, definitely better than someone who is sober but judging you the whole time.\n\nThat being said she did give herself a bad trip for sure by getting into a fight right before she blasted off. That was a big mistake lol", "And also, we don\u2019t know how much those friends know about the friends whereabouts.

The thing that will make her friends upset is the fact that she did not call anybody else to help her best friend AND she basically ignored everyone for the rest of the night. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, there were other options between between babysit and go to sleep. OP chose neither and seems to think everything should be peachy.", "Lol, my boyfriend (non-Native English speaker) says intimate when he means intimidate.

She knows your history/trauma with drug use and forced you into a situation you were not ok with.  She obviously let many other people know what was going on, so someone else could have stepped up to take care of her/check her well being.", "NTA. You didn't consent to care for her. If the other friends were so worried, maybe they should have gone and helped her. Instead of texting you she could text emergency services.  \n\n\nThis doesn't sound like a good friend.", "NTA. If she wanted a sober friend with her, she should've either waited with taking it, until she knows the friend is ok with watching her, or at the very least call a friend over, that hasn't made it explicitly clear, that he/she has a problem with being around drug users. All in all it was just really stupid decicion making on her part. Also, no wonder it went bad. It would've been a pretty good indicator, that the drug was shitty, when someone just gives it to her as a freebie.", "NTA she should have asked before you ever went there.\nYou were honest about your boundaries and left.\nShe chose to use substances alone, thinking she could guilt you into staying.", "Seconding this comment from another user and pasting it to emphasise just how correct it is:\n\n\"NTA\n\nYour friend was very silly and very irresponsible. Tripsitters need to be familiar with the drugs at hand, sober, consenting and present prior to the drugs being taken. She was wrong for choosing you and springing it on you even if you had no issues with it. Given your history and boundaries, she was also deeply insensitive and inconsiderate. All in all, she's TA\n\nHaving said that, for future reference, in situations like this it's really important to contact someone else and let them know what's happening. Solo trips can be very dangerous when they go wrong.\"", "NTA i had a friend get physically violent on a bad acid trip (and she later pulled this same shit) so i understand not wanting to trip sit. The fact she didn\u2019t mention she had taken the acid til after you said no to trip sitting is manipulative", "NTA.  \nIt's not like she didn't know your boundaries when it came to drugs, and she tried to entrap you into staying by saying she already took it.   \nThat's on her.

Then they need to shut up, because they obviously weren't that worried.", "Yeah some of these comments are weird, I've done lsd, I did a years worth of research and reading anecdotal experiences beforehand.\n\nLsd is easily the safest and most chill of all the psychedelics (generally speaking), it's important to have someone with you who has taken it before and bad trips do happen but overall you're pretty in control of yourself.\n\nPeople who experience permanent effects afterwards overwhelmingly have family histories of issues such as schizophrenia making them predisposed to it.\n\nThe main thing to worry about is how fucking long the trip time is.", "Up to 22 hours!

The last thing you want to deal with when you are tripping are EMTs and cops. That will make a bad trip into a nightmare. I have done a lot of psychedelics and have never had a really bad trip. I figured out pretty quickly that psychedelics are not party drugs. Set and setting are the key. Trip around people you trust. I usually trip alone or with other people who are tripping. I have had some truly awesome experiences that have expanded the way I perceive things.", ">It doesn't sound like OP would have known what to do if they were there when things get bad, given their discomfort with drugs.\n\nI absolutely wouldn't have known what to do. As a college student who's never even taken alcohol, much less drugs, and would leave a party if my friends took anything stronger than weed, I'd probably just call the paramedics or something because I'd have *no idea* what to do.", "I'll put it this way - the moral thing to do is to not turn your phone off. I gave said they both suck and they both did shitty things. OP wasn't being made to take drugs. She wasn't being made to stay in a room with someone on meth. Her friend dropped LSD and asked for a sitter. OP, who lives in the same dorm, decides to leave her alone, not tell anyone she needs assistance AND TURNED OFF HER PHONE. That's so much worse. \n\nIf you have never had a friend put you un a shitty situation that made you uncomfortable you're extremely lucky. I have. And I've never just abandoned them because I care about their welfare and wouldn't be able to live with myself if something happened to them because I couldn't put my discomfort aside and make sure they were ok. \n\nI'm fine with people not liking my answer. To me friendship isn't just being there when times are good and all boundaries are being respected. It's also about being there when shit goes belly up and you have to do stuff you don't want to do. That's the hard work of friendship. \n\nIf someone tells me they have injested drugs to kill themselves I am not responsible for their choice, but I am responsible for the choice *I* make next.

Obviously she's not a good friend. Everyone who uses recreationally should know; NEVER trick someone into doing drugs/being around people on drugs. NEVER have someone who could kill the vibe/make you uncomfortable around when taking psychedelics. ALWAYS get everyone's consent whether you're doing drugs in front of them, carrying/high in a place where you could get caught (in a car etc.) or about to have sex with them while you're high and they don't know.

That is, they\u2019re apocryphal. The flying story dates back to the death of Diane Linkletter, whose suicide by jumping was (falsely) rumored to have been the result of an acid trip. If all the people I\u2019ve heard repeat this urban legend over the years were telling the truth, thinking you can fly would surely be a known effect of LSD by now. But it isn\u2019t.

Permanently? Like, how many? I kind of doubt it's that many unless some bad acid went around your area or you are friends with a lot of mentally ill people.\n\nAcid is a very intense drug and I recommend taking it with a LOT of caution, and if you have any question about your mental health, not at all. But the idea that it randomly makes people go crazy is an urban legend. It can definitely give you massive anxiety attacks and if you are prone to certain mental illnesses, it can trigger them. I'm NOT saying it's without risk. But the VAST majority of people who take acid are totally fine, even if they have a bad trip.\n\nIt's something you shouldn't do lightly, and you should do it mindfully and with an experienced trip sitter in a safe environment (at a festival can count as long as you have good friends).\n\nI don\u2019t like acid, but I dislike when people claim things like this without acknowledging that they are the minority.", "This was truly enlightening to read.

It\u2019s interesting to read about the flip side of it.\n\nFor me, everything suddenly felt clear, I felt in flow with the whole world and like I instinctively understood everything about it. I even worked through and shed some of my ancestors\u2019 weight and consciously untangled my digestive issues. It honestly did more than my 10 years of therapy combined.\n\nHowever, my circumstances were completely different from yours. I started experimenting with psychedelics in my 30s and my motive has always been self-discovery and healing. I worked my way up from micro dosing to finally deciding to have an actual trip on my sixth attempt, and only after spending time to ensure my environment was safe and free from clutter or distractions. I also prepared myself by setting intentions and checking in with my body.\n\nI feel I\u2019m still dabbling and the possibility of having a bad trip is always present, but I think your relationship to yourself (and trust) is instrumental. Psychedelics can really be your best friend or worst enemy.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but the friend did it when she knowingly knows OP had trauma related to it.

Luckily my friend had some rolls and that helped bring me down and I eventually had fun. \n\nI'd never do either again.

However, when my friend got blackout drunk I put that shit aside and helped her because she couldn't help herself and she could have died. Thats my stance. She probably went to her becauze she trusted her over everyone else. And now that trust is 100% gone.

In my opinion, being mad at someone shouldn\u2019t negate the fundamental fact that you care about them and want them to be safe.
