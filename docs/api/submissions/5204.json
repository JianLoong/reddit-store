We even coordinated our college admissions to get into the same school, and managed to get into the same dorm, just a few doors down from each other. \n\nEver since we started college, my friend has been experimenting with all kinds of drugs. I don't know exactly what, because I strongly dislike drugs due to some family members with substance abuse, and do my best to know as little about her experimenting as possible. I've even told her that I don't want to be anywhere near her while she's on anything, as being around people that are under the influence of anything makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, last week she invited me to her dorm which is pretty normal, we're almost always together in one of our rooms. This time though, as soon as I came in she started talking about how she got some LSD from a classmate in one of her gen eds and she was super excited to try it out. I stopped her and reminded her that these kinds of things make me uncomfortable and I didn't want to hear about it, and she said she knew but this was different. \n\nApparently when people do LSD, they're supposed to have a sober friend stay with them, in case things go bad or something, and she wanted me to be her sober person because she trusts me more than anyone. I told her definitely not, there was no way I was comfortable with that, and I started leaving. That's when she started freaking out and told me that she already took the LSD right before I got there, and I had to stick around because otherwise she'd be alone and anything could happen. I said that wasn't my fault and left, despite her begging. \n\nI guess things did go bad, because before long I started getting some increasingly frantic texts from her. Stuff that didn't really make any sense, but was obviously from someone who was panicky. I texted her back that I wouldn't be helping her and then turned my phone off for the night. \n\nI woke up to a ton of texts from her, and I guess she must have texted our other friends because our entire friend group had lit up my phone, telling me that she was in trouble and that I should go check on her. I went through and responded to each of them explaining the situation (they all know my history with drugs as well) and all but one of them said some variation of calling me a dickhead and saying that I should have gotten over it and checked on her, because things were apparently really going wrong for her. \n\nWe were supposed to be doing things together on Christmas break, but ever since this happened I'm only getting one word texts back from her, and she's refusing to talk to me in person. I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but we've never gone this long without talking and I'm really starting to doubt myself.

You were clear that being the \u201csafe person\u201d to babysit her during her experimentation wasn\u2019t something you can do for your own wellbeing. She tried to manipulate you and corner you into doing something that she knew caused you to be deeply uncomfortable by taking the acid before you arrived. Then when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, she set all of your mutual friends against you. That\u2019s on the verge of narcissistic behavior - pushing boundaries, manipulation, sending the flying monkeys in to punish you for not complying with her violation of your boundaries. \n\nI would be examining my relationship with her if this is a regular thing.", "NTA.

Says something about her idea of the friendship.\nYou\u2019re an ah (small) for not trying to replace the sober friend with someone else.  It\u2019s ok that you didn\u2019t stay.  You set a boundary, yes, but sometimes you may need to look outside the box to maintain your boundary and still try to keep dumbass friends from serious danger.\nEveryone else is an AH for dumping on you and not stepping up.  \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you go be her sober friend?\u201d Should be the go-to answer to all of them.", "NTA.

But you also are TA because once you were aware there was a problem you had a responsibility as a human being to help.  That does not mean you had to get personally involved or check on her. You could have alerted a mutual friend, alerted your dorm RA, called your college's medical clinic, alerted campus security, or called 911 for a paramedic.  You had many, many options, but ignoring the situation was not one of them.", "I\u2019m honestly torn her between NTA and kinda TA for not checking in her. I completely understand your stance and boundary you created for yourself when it comes to drugs!! She was an asshole for taking it and just assuming that you\u2019d stay there with her. LSD is no joke. She was in the wrong one million percent!! But part of me feels like you should of checked on her or at least spoke with another friend who could, as her LSD trip could of ended very badly! I get why she\u2019s hurt and not answering your calls now, but that\u2019s the consequences of her own actions!! She should of cleared her plan with your first! Overall judgement is NTA. I hope you can mend this relationship with your friend and get her out of this experimenting phase!", "NTA. Your friend knew your issues with drugs but tried forcing you to stay with her by not asking you before taking the drugs. That's on them 100%. Although, you probably should've called someone to stay with them.", "ESH. She should have waited to see if you'd babysit. However LSD is not a trifling thing and when it goes bad it can go really fucking bad - thinking you can fly, cutting open your arms to remove the bugs, satan is chasing me into traffic kind of bad. That is why a babysitter is highly advised. This girl is such a close friend you went to school together, spend most days together, but when her welfare is seriously in question you walk away. That's not something a good friend does. \n\nYes she put you in a shitty situation. But sometimes friends do that. That's when you find out how good a friend you really are. And you failed. You left your friend in a potentially dangerous situation because you felt uncomfortable. \n\nYou both suck. But you a little bit more so.\n\n*edited cause bad grammar and missing letters*", "ESH: she\u2019s absolute the asshole for putting you in that situation and ignoring your boundaries. \n\nHowever, you actively ignored a friend in a possibly very dangerous situation. I don\u2019t think you would have had to stay and babysit, but you couldn\u2019t have let anyone else know? Not even called 911 and told them your friend is having a bad response to a drug? \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a blatant disrespect for someone\u2019s life and safety that you didn\u2019t even tell anyone else or ask another friend to sit with them, but rather completely ignored them even when you saw that they were having a bad trip. You doubled down and stayed stubborn when you SHOULD have 100% let someone know. \n\nYour friend was over the line on forcing you in that position but your response was just as shitty \u2014 people die from that stuff and you don\u2019t seem to care.", "ESH. She should obviously have asked you before taking the LSD, to just do it and expect you to look after her is wrong. You are also a terrible pick (no fault of yours) to be the sober person, she really needs someone who could help if things go wrong. Having someone with no drug experience and who is drug negative be the person to guide you is clueless. To take LSD and then immediately start a conflict with a friend is a really dumb thing to do, she needs to take a look at her life choices and if she is going to do stuff like this she needs to do it in a safe way.\n\nAfter things had started going wrong I think you should have helped in someway, either in person or by alerting a mutual friend. Your friend was going through a seriously negative mental experience, just because it was her own fault doesn't mean you should ignore her calls for help.", "Gotta go with ESH. Unbelievable what your roommate did to you.  But to ignore her when she desperately needs help was too much. Call another friend in the dorm to help, or even call 911 if you can't  bring yourself to check on her.", "ESH. \nObviously she\u2019s the AH for even asking you, but there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re uncomfortable around drugs. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone expected you to stay with her or not be angry that she asked, but the dynamic in this relationship is tilted. She trusted that you would keep her safe and you had zero desire to keep her safe. \n\nYou did nothing. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell a different friend, campus health or even the RA-who in most universities has training to deal with situations like this.\n\nI want to emphasize again that what she did was stupid and dangerous and irresponsible, and she\u2019s a massive ah for doing this. But it was dangerous. It could have ended horribly. Maybe it did end horribly and she hasn\u2019t told you, yet. \n\nI don\u2019t see you coming back from this because neither of you can trust the other now.", "NTA\n\nAnd this friend of yours fucked up, hard, and i think YOU need to be reconsidering how good of a friend she really is.  She's so focused on getting high that she's intentionally ignored your stance, intentionally lied by omission to make you participate in her activities, and denied your right to consent.  Fuck her, honestly.\n\nAnd all these other friends.  None of them wanted to step up, or call your friend out.  If anyone REALLY gave a shit and cared, they should've called 911 if the girl was reacting that bad.  But nobody did.  All they did was force all responsibility on YOU, despite you having the most reasons not to dirty your hands with this mess.\n\nCall it karma, \"fucking around and finding out,\" or whatever little catch phrase you want- your friend is an irresponsible asshole and tried to manipulate you.  I hope her experience was terrible.  If you stuck around, all it would've done is set a precedent for her to trap you for all her future experiments.  While I'm against drugs in the first place on a personal level, she has no fuckin' business experimenting if she's this bad at planning for it.  \n\nYou two might have a long history and be close, but people change and you 100% made the right choice here.  May want to have a serious talk with her and give your friend some tough love before it's too late- this is the kind of slippery slope that can destroy your friendship and her life.  Protect yourself., as you did here.  Adults can only hold themselves responsible for their own actions.", "ESH she shouldnt force you to be a tripsitter. Youve made your stance on drugs clear, that you dont want to engage with them, but that youre okay with her doing it. She should also choose someone with experience instead of someone who actively distance themself. If shit goes sour, you cant do anything else than get her medical attention, which isnt necessarily the solution.\n\nHOWEVER, the second it started going sour for her, you definitely shouldve gotten her the medical attention.

Why would you not check on a \u201cgood\u201d friend, that feels like she is going die? You say you know about drug abuse, so you assumingly also know what scared people can do while they are experiencing a bad trip. I would not have forgiven myself if i let my friend alone in that state, no matter how angry you are that she put you in that position. You could have talked to her at a later (no drugs taken) time. \n\nIf i were your friend, i would probably second guess my friendship with you, they felt horrible and were in a very weak spot emotionally and you just left them..", "NTA - you checking in would have done nothing and maybe made it worse. I\u2019ve done a lot of LSD, and it makes you sensitive as fuck to the way people are feeling.

Which is hilarious looking back on it seeing as we\u2019re literally neighbors. \n\nNow? Now he\u2019s sobered up. He\u2019s trying to get better so he can take care of his mom. He\u2019s also attending college full time. I\u2019m honestly proud of him, he did that on his own, with friends who kept pressuring him to continue spiraling. Eventually, he reached back out to me (needed help with his FAFSA) and we began to mend things from there. \n\nAdvice? Be aware that your friendship has been damaged. You did indeed choose your boundaries over her. She\u2019s hurt.

However, I would NEVER ever force someone to trip sit me without telling them beforehand and getting clear consent. That is super fucked it. I hope that while her trip was bad from being alone, she realized how selfish and inconsiderate her actions were. Nothing better than some psychedelics to make you realize you have to change as a person. \n\nYou are definitely not the asshole in this scenario!

Which is ok, she put you in a shitty situation, but don\u2019t expect to be friends after.\n\nI think this is an easy ESH.  And all the people saying call the cops\u2026.just wow.

That she took the drug before having you cone over demonstrates she was afraid you wouldn\u2019t agree to be her safe person so she decided to give you no choice.  That is on her.  That she did that is only part of the problem. What if her reaction had been so over the top you wouldn\u2019t know how to help.  \n\nYour years of friendship cause you to feel really bad about this coming to an end but it may be a blessing in disguise.  Not all friendships last a lifetime.  People change.  Just assure yourself that she chose to impose all this on you without your consent.  To then be angry that you did not allow her to do that is not an act of friendship on her part.

Going off of the stories I've read here you want a trip sitter that is experienced in calming people under the influence down and having an uncomfortable of even scared trip sitter would ruin the experience for both of them, making it even more dangerous, and probably scaring or traumatizing OP even more.

Beyond abandoning her there are a number of options he could have taken, stayed with her, called mutual friends who could be trusted and have one, or more of them, come to support so that OP could be removed from the situation. To leave, without someone else aware and available, and then turn off his phone (despite knowing there was a problem with his friend) is really shitty thing to do. I  can't begin to imagine how awful and guilty OP would have felt if something had happened to his friend because of his inaction (his fault or not).

I'm not sure what action I would have taken if bad things were going down. \n\nBut really,  how do you deal with that sort of thing? Especially if you've made yourself clear that you're not interested in doing this?  This is not a duty to thrust on someone.", "and LSD is one of the safer things to be doing -- as long as you know *what* you're doing. if you need to be experimenting with drugs, you also need to be responsible about it.\n\ne: phrasing", "the only thing OP made clear is how much of a prick they are\n\nthat friendship is over", "Irresponsible, too. \n\nIf you want/need a tripsitter (sober buddy) because you're nervous about taking a recreational drug for the first time, you get that plan laid out in stone *before* taking anything. Otherwise you have no one but yourself to blame if/when things go badly and you're up shit creek without a paddle. \n\nTripsitting isn't always an easy, passive task, either. For an unenthusiastic tripsitter it's annoying and time-consuming at best. You're literally babysitting a full-ass adult who is on powerful perception-altering drugs for *hours* (LSD lasts a *minimum* of 7-8 hrs). Someone who's never done LSD before can have an *extremely* negative and/or violent reaction to it, and as a tripsitter, you need to be prepared for that possibility. It's not something that just gets sprung on you last-minute because the person doing the drugs was feeling selfish and impatient. \n\nAnd God forbid OP's friend didn't do any research prior, because LSD generally doesn't play nice with other drugs in the system, including many prescription drugs for anxiety and depression. And just because there's no \"lethal dose\" of LSD doesn't mean that it can't kill or permanently harm you: in worst-case scenarios it's known to cause seizures and lasting severe psychosis. Not even to mention that once you've taken LSD, there's no backing out. You're riding that train for anywhere between 8-12 hours and there ain't shit you (or anyone else) can do to stop it preemptively.", "I mean if OP and friend are away at school then maybe one of their old friends couldn't get there.  I think the logical thing would have been to call paramedics or an advice line when OPs friend started frantically texting.  That could have negative consequences on friend, but at least they may be medically safe (though OP would still be an AH to all the friend group I'm sure.)", "I do drugs occasionally and have absolutely zero expectations of my friends who don't support it to check in on me. That's pretty frickin selfish. This was a big betrayal by the friend. OP did not consent to babysitting their friend. Them not checking in is them maintaining the boundary they set.", "Honestly I wonder if OP leaving started the trip off on a bad note that then spiralled. Making sure you have a safe comfortable setting and vibe is so key to having a good trip.", "Wow *illegal* drugs.\n\nWhat does it feel like to draw your sense for what is right and wrong from arbitrarily created laws designed to lock people in prison?", "Friend violated OP, she knew OP would not consent and tried to coerce OP into doing something they didn't want to. End of. I'll bet the friends wouldn't have wanted OP to call 911 but that's all OP \"owed\" them after they pulled this stunt.", "Yeah this definitely an ESH here. Friend fucked up majorly, but if you care about someone and they are in need, why wouldn\u2019t you do something, anything besides turn off your phone?", "Exactly. OP should have called an RA to take her to campus medical. It would have helped the friend with whatever medical issues they made have been happening, and kept her from ever pulling that shit with OP again.", "best answer here, absolutely. really inconsiderate and idiotic decision-making from the friend there and very very cold response from OP. definitely ESH", "If OP calls any authority figure, RA/whatever, they will call police and friend will be royally fucked. Being kicked out of the dorm would likely be a best case, worst case arrested and we know for certain her friend and friend group would have blamed her for that. It\u2019s a no-win situation for OP.", "That was OP's \"friend's\" responsibility to let someone else know. OP made it clear they didn't even want to know about this dangerous past time of theirs. This is 1000% on the shitty friend. When she saw OP wasn't going to be blackmailed into helping she should have contacted someone else.", "if their supposed to be friends, OP\u2019s friend would have never but them in that situation in the first place", "the friend put herself in a dangerous situation by absolutely trampling OPs boundaries. The friend is aware of how OPs feels and it isn\u2019t their job to have to babysit their friend. If the friend was such a \u201cclose friend\u201d she would have NEVER put OP in that situation to begin with", "911? Yes. The police specifically? No. Call and ask for EMS. This is a medical emergency, and the cops are not trained to handle them.", "right?! regardless of whether OP is ta or not (I'm still on the fence and tentatively going with ESH leaning towards friend being worse)... from her perspective (I know it's somewhat delusional and that she's an AH for even thinking it but it is what it is) you abandoned her when she was really vulnerable and scared. She may be in the wrong but the friendship may not recover from this, especially not without a really frank conversation.", "BTW next time tell an RA or other person with authority. They are actually trained on handling drugs and dealing with residents who aren't mentally sound. Your \"friend\" sounds like she needs help and isn't getting any.", "OP\u2019s mental health 100% comes before their friends physical health.

Friends or not people are entitled to their boundaries.

Then the friend would be mad at that", "I am assuming this is a high school friends list and the rest are far away since these 2 friends did a lot of coordination to go to the same college.  Shame as sounds like their friendship is minimally going to be pretty cool for a while if not completely done.  :(", "OP may not use she/her pronouns.", "Dude I knew so many people who got permanently messed up from LSD, many of them ended up in the mental hospital.  Many were still getting flashbacks months or even years later.\n\nLSD scared the hell out of me.\n\nI stumbled across one of these LSD users on Facebook recently, one of the ones who spent time in a mental hospital (and also started using it in grade 5 or 6).  While his current life isn't great, it also isn't terrible. He is heavily into dog rescues now, and hasn't been institutionalized in the last decade.", "My boyfriend doesn't do drugs and doesn't want to be around people on them. I occasionally take something. I once asked him if he wanted to be sober person, but he said no. That was the end of that and I wouldn't  dare to even think of ambushing him like that. She made her own bed. She didn't ask them because she knew the answer will be \"no\". Instead she tried to guilt trip them into staying, without any consideration for their feelings.", "Why? Because seems to me that she set her boundaries and her friend tried to force her to do something she absolutely isn't comfortable with...", "Every single friend that this friend had texted could've stepped in and checked on her. It's her responsibility to make sure she's covered if she needs someone to be there. It would be different if OP had initially said yes and then backed out but that's not what happened.", "Why didn\u2019t OPs friend ask someone else to do it? Op isn\u2019t her caregiver and has no responsibility over her mistakes", "Off topic, but I've never seen or heard the term \"fait accompli,\" and I was sure it may have been a typo or something, until I looked it up. So thanks for indirectly teaching me something today! lol", "I know someone who was shot and killed by the cops because he was on acid and reacted poorly when he encountered them.  If OP is in the US, cops could be a death sentence for their friend.", "LSD isn't deadly, in fact; it's helped people with depression, anxiety, and bipolar. Microdosing it is just as effective (if not better) than antidepressants. \n\nLSD is what helped open my mind enough to see that I had been in a cult for 28 years and to finally start the healing process. I'm so very thankful psychedelics just became legal here in Colorado. Their medicinal purposes are amazing.", "Because I should feel bad for the college srudent dropping acid in their dorm room, threatening their future education?", "Yeah the friend really set herself up for a bad trip with this situation. AH move on her part, but I agree that OP could have tried to find a helpful solution here.", "If it was between the friend\u2019s life and the friend experiencing legal repercussions, I would, and hope OP would, always choose the friends life. \n\nThe friend got really lucky this time, but if they continue down this path it can lead to much much worse. \n\nAlso, I do feel a bit like don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time. OP\u2019s friend is young and is experimenting, but is doing so in one of the most dangerous ways possible. Personally, I feel as though legal repercussions earlier in life is much better than possible addiction (which very often leads to WORSE legal consequences) or death/severe health issues (excluding addiction). \n\nIt is a bit of a lose-lose, but with someone\u2019s life possibly on the line? I think it would be the responsible act to contact medical assistance at the risk of the friend getting in trouble.", "OP\u2019s friendship with this person (and probably the friend group) is done no matter what. So really it just comes down to a) being safe, but arrested or b) being unsafe but legally in the clear", "All those other people could have also gone over and attended to the friend. OP has made it clear that she is uncomfortable around drugs in any form, and implies that drugs are triggering for her due to her background. The friend was manipulative and frankly, faced the consequences that she was due.   \n\n\nI have friends who do LSD and they would NEVER put anyone in that position.", "You're not wrong, but at the same time, does that mean you should just let her get hurt if you can prevent it?", ">Nothing wrong with a welfare check.\n\nShe doesn't need a welfare check, she needs medical attention and to be observed in hospital setting.

They clearly have different interests and goals for college, and considering she already dropping LSD alone in her dorm I\u2019d say she\u2019s pretty strongly in the experiment and party group and her friend will be hanging out with new people soon who have similar interest.

Let\u2019s be clear. \n\nAnd maybe I\u2019m reading too much into this but OP\u2019s response or lack there of is coming off negligent and uncaring.

She didn\u2019t seem concerned at the time, OP doesn\u2019t even mention that knowing her friend went down that path and it got potentially dangerous was damaging to her mental health. Outside of her just not wanting to be around drugs (which is totally understandable) nothing about how OP responded to this situation leads to fact that she was having a trauma response. I am aware that everybody responds differently but OP should really have mentioned that to her friend or her other friends why she couldn\u2019t deal with this. \n\nIt really just seemed like she didn\u2019t care and sort\u2019ve blocked everything out.

Why couldn't they go over there (if possible if they also attend said college), call the dorm, call the police,  etc?\n\nIt's possible that OP has no experience with LSD trips so she wouldn't know what to do.
