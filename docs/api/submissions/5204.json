We even coordinated our college admissions to get into the same school, and managed to get into the same dorm, just a few doors down from each other. \n\nEver since we started college, my friend has been experimenting with all kinds of drugs. I don't know exactly what, because I strongly dislike drugs due to some family members with substance abuse, and do my best to know as little about her experimenting as possible. I've even told her that I don't want to be anywhere near her while she's on anything, as being around people that are under the influence of anything makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, last week she invited me to her dorm which is pretty normal, we're almost always together in one of our rooms. This time though, as soon as I came in she started talking about how she got some LSD from a classmate in one of her gen eds and she was super excited to try it out. I stopped her and reminded her that these kinds of things make me uncomfortable and I didn't want to hear about it, and she said she knew but this was different. \n\nApparently when people do LSD, they're supposed to have a sober friend stay with them, in case things go bad or something, and she wanted me to be her sober person because she trusts me more than anyone. I told her definitely not, there was no way I was comfortable with that, and I started leaving. That's when she started freaking out and told me that she already took the LSD right before I got there, and I had to stick around because otherwise she'd be alone and anything could happen. I said that wasn't my fault and left, despite her begging. \n\nI guess things did go bad, because before long I started getting some increasingly frantic texts from her. Stuff that didn't really make any sense, but was obviously from someone who was panicky. I texted her back that I wouldn't be helping her and then turned my phone off for the night. \n\nI woke up to a ton of texts from her, and I guess she must have texted our other friends because our entire friend group had lit up my phone, telling me that she was in trouble and that I should go check on her. I went through and responded to each of them explaining the situation (they all know my history with drugs as well) and all but one of them said some variation of calling me a dickhead and saying that I should have gotten over it and checked on her, because things were apparently really going wrong for her. \n\nWe were supposed to be doing things together on Christmas break, but ever since this happened I'm only getting one word texts back from her, and she's refusing to talk to me in person. I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but we've never gone this long without talking and I'm really starting to doubt myself.

You made your boundaries clear. She disrespected them", "NTA\n\nYour friend was very silly and very irresponsible. Tripsitters need to be familiar with the drugs at hand, sober, consenting and present prior to the drugs being taken. She was wrong for choosing you and springing it on you even if you had no issues with it. Given your history and boundaries, she was also deeply insensitive and inconsiderate. All in all, she's TA\n\nHaving said that, for future reference, in situations like this it's *really* important to contact someone else and let them know what's happening. Solo trips can be very dangerous when they go wrong.", "NTA\n\n  \nShe knows your story and took her pill before even asking you to be her sober person. She's selfish and irresponsible. It seems like you two are on very different levels and your best friend is not even a friend anymore.", "NTA you've made it clear repeatedly that you don't want any part of this and she forced you into this situation. If her other friends are so concerned they can step up and take care of her during a trip", "NTA and I quit reading after you said she took the LSD before she asked you to be her sober buddy. That was UNBELIEVABLY shitty of her to do to you.", "NTA. You were clear that being the \u201csafe person\u201d to babysit her during her experimentation wasn\u2019t something you can do for your own wellbeing. She tried to manipulate you and corner you into doing something that she knew caused you to be deeply uncomfortable by taking the acid before you arrived. Then when she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, she set all of your mutual friends against you. That\u2019s on the verge of narcissistic behavior - pushing boundaries, manipulation, sending the flying monkeys in to punish you for not complying with her violation of your boundaries. \n\nI would be examining my relationship with her if this is a regular thing.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your friend. She knew that you do not want to be around her when she\u2019s on drugs, and she tried to force it on you anyways. Find new friends.", "NTA. She knew you would say no. That\u2019s why she took it before you got there. You have very clearly set your boundaries regarding drugs and she stomped all over them. She could have chosen anyone from your friend group but she chose you on purpose.", "YkindaTA. It could\u2019ve gone pretty bad without a sober sitter. I get your history and all that, but if she\u2019s your closest friend you probably could\u2019ve just stayed. It\u2019s not like she was forcing YOU to take LSD.", "ETA\nAnother commenter put it perfectly.\nFriend is an AH because she assumed you\u2019d be her sober friend even though she knew your feelings on the matter.  Says something about her idea of the friendship.\nYou\u2019re an ah (small) for not trying to replace the sober friend with someone else.  It\u2019s ok that you didn\u2019t stay.  You set a boundary, yes, but sometimes you may need to look outside the box to maintain your boundary and still try to keep dumbass friends from serious danger.\nEveryone else is an AH for dumping on you and not stepping up.  \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you go be her sober friend?\u201d Should be the go-to answer to all of them.", "NTA. But you absolutely chose your boundary over her and should probably expect her to distance from you now. A bad LSD trip can really change a person, and it sounds like hers was quite bad indeed.", "ESH She never should have asked you and she should have waited to take it until she had an agreement from someone to watch her, not tried to coerce you into it .  But you also are TA because once you were aware there was a problem you had a responsibility as a human being to help.  That does not mean you had to get personally involved or check on her. You could have alerted a mutual friend, alerted your dorm RA, called your college's medical clinic, alerted campus security, or called 911 for a paramedic.  You had many, many options, but ignoring the situation was not one of them.", "I\u2019m honestly torn her between NTA and kinda TA for not checking in her. I completely understand your stance and boundary you created for yourself when it comes to drugs!! She was an asshole for taking it and just assuming that you\u2019d stay there with her. LSD is no joke. She was in the wrong one million percent!! But part of me feels like you should of checked on her or at least spoke with another friend who could, as her LSD trip could of ended very badly! I get why she\u2019s hurt and not answering your calls now, but that\u2019s the consequences of her own actions!! She should of cleared her plan with your first! Overall judgement is NTA. I hope you can mend this relationship with your friend and get her out of this experimenting phase!", "NTA. Your friend knew your issues with drugs but tried forcing you to stay with her by not asking you before taking the drugs. That's on them 100%. Although, you probably should've called someone to stay with them.", "ESH. She should have waited to see if you'd babysit. However LSD is not a trifling thing and when it goes bad it can go really fucking bad - thinking you can fly, cutting open your arms to remove the bugs, satan is chasing me into traffic kind of bad. That is why a babysitter is highly advised. This girl is such a close friend you went to school together, spend most days together, but when her welfare is seriously in question you walk away. That's not something a good friend does. \n\nYes she put you in a shitty situation. But sometimes friends do that. That's when you find out how good a friend you really are. And you failed. You left your friend in a potentially dangerous situation because you felt uncomfortable. \n\nYou both suck. But you a little bit more so.\n\n*edited cause bad grammar and missing letters*", "ESH: she\u2019s absolute the asshole for putting you in that situation and ignoring your boundaries. \n\nHowever, you actively ignored a friend in a possibly very dangerous situation. I don\u2019t think you would have had to stay and babysit, but you couldn\u2019t have let anyone else know? Not even called 911 and told them your friend is having a bad response to a drug? \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a blatant disrespect for someone\u2019s life and safety that you didn\u2019t even tell anyone else or ask another friend to sit with them, but rather completely ignored them even when you saw that they were having a bad trip. You doubled down and stayed stubborn when you SHOULD have 100% let someone know. \n\nYour friend was over the line on forcing you in that position but your response was just as shitty \u2014 people die from that stuff and you don\u2019t seem to care.", "ESH. She should obviously have asked you before taking the LSD, to just do it and expect you to look after her is wrong. You are also a terrible pick (no fault of yours) to be the sober person, she really needs someone who could help if things go wrong. Having someone with no drug experience and who is drug negative be the person to guide you is clueless. To take LSD and then immediately start a conflict with a friend is a really dumb thing to do, she needs to take a look at her life choices and if she is going to do stuff like this she needs to do it in a safe way.\n\nAfter things had started going wrong I think you should have helped in someway, either in person or by alerting a mutual friend. Your friend was going through a seriously negative mental experience, just because it was her own fault doesn't mean you should ignore her calls for help.", "Gotta go with ESH. Unbelievable what your roommate did to you.  But to ignore her when she desperately needs help was too much. Call another friend in the dorm to help, or even call 911 if you can't  bring yourself to check on her.", "ESH. \nObviously she\u2019s the AH for even asking you, but there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re uncomfortable around drugs. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone expected you to stay with her or not be angry that she asked, but the dynamic in this relationship is tilted. She trusted that you would keep her safe and you had zero desire to keep her safe. \n\nYou did nothing. \n\nYou didn\u2019t tell a different friend, campus health or even the RA-who in most universities has training to deal with situations like this.\n\nI want to emphasize again that what she did was stupid and dangerous and irresponsible, and she\u2019s a massive ah for doing this. But it was dangerous. It could have ended horribly. Maybe it did end horribly and she hasn\u2019t told you, yet. \n\nI don\u2019t see you coming back from this because neither of you can trust the other now.", "NTA\n\nAnd this friend of yours fucked up, hard, and i think YOU need to be reconsidering how good of a friend she really is.  She's so focused on getting high that she's intentionally ignored your stance, intentionally lied by omission to make you participate in her activities, and denied your right to consent.  Fuck her, honestly.\n\nAnd all these other friends.  None of them wanted to step up, or call your friend out.  If anyone REALLY gave a shit and cared, they should've called 911 if the girl was reacting that bad.  But nobody did.  All they did was force all responsibility on YOU, despite you having the most reasons not to dirty your hands with this mess.\n\nCall it karma, \"fucking around and finding out,\" or whatever little catch phrase you want- your friend is an irresponsible asshole and tried to manipulate you.  I hope her experience was terrible.  If you stuck around, all it would've done is set a precedent for her to trap you for all her future experiments.  While I'm against drugs in the first place on a personal level, she has no fuckin' business experimenting if she's this bad at planning for it.  \n\nYou two might have a long history and be close, but people change and you 100% made the right choice here.  May want to have a serious talk with her and give your friend some tough love before it's too late- this is the kind of slippery slope that can destroy your friendship and her life.  Protect yourself., as you did here.  Adults can only hold themselves responsible for their own actions.", "ESH she shouldnt force you to be a tripsitter. Youve made your stance on drugs clear, that you dont want to engage with them, but that youre okay with her doing it. She should also choose someone with experience instead of someone who actively distance themself. If shit goes sour, you cant do anything else than get her medical attention, which isnt necessarily the solution.\n\nHOWEVER, the second it started going sour for her, you definitely shouldve gotten her the medical attention. Regardless of whos in the wrong, you dont leave or ignore someone you know needs help.", "NTA\n\n\n\n\nLSD is illegal in most states so you should stay as far away from it as possible", "NTA call the police on her next time.", "ETA/ YTA She is the ah because she put you on the spot, but you are more the ah in my opinion. Why would you not check on a \u201cgood\u201d friend, that feels like she is going die? You say you know about drug abuse, so you assumingly also know what scared people can do while they are experiencing a bad trip. I would not have forgiven myself if i let my friend alone in that state, no matter how angry you are that she put you in that position. You could have talked to her at a later (no drugs taken) time. \n\nIf i were your friend, i would probably second guess my friendship with you, they felt horrible and were in a very weak spot emotionally and you just left them..", "NTA - you checking in would have done nothing and maybe made it worse. I\u2019ve done a lot of LSD, and it makes you sensitive as fuck to the way people are feeling. She would have fixated on getting your approval of her lifestyle for the next 6-12 hours.\n\nI only ever did weed and acid.
