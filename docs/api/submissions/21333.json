So yea EVERYONE IS AN A on this particular day but YTA overall", "NTA if he has money for night out he has money for baby sitter.

Your brother has been put into a difficult circumstance due to something he couldn\u2019t control, but that still doesn\u2019t make it your problem. Do you not have other family that could help him?

Does it suck? A lot of times, yes, but that's part of being a parent. His lack of social and/or sex life isn't your problem. \nAs for causing a scene in front of the kid, that's on him.

You should NEVER drop off a kid at a door. Even if the person had AGREED to babysit you should go to the door and wait until the person opens it and you are assured that the child has appropriate care for the evening.\n\nOn the other hand, you suck as a brother. I am not experienced with kids but watching a four year old on an occasional basis isn't rocket science and actually can be kind of fun and pleasurable. It isn't like an infant that requires actual knowledgable care in terms of feeding and diaper changes. You can even just entertain a four year old by sticking them in front of some cartoons if you truly didn't want to make the slightest bit of effort. \n\nWhile no one should be forced to babysit and it certainly isn't an obligation because of biology most people in functional families do provide help to their siblings and parents and it is generally reciprocal when a family dynamic isn't warped or dysfunctional. Your brother is in a hard space raising a child without any kind of help from family or friends.\n\nAnd the expense of a baby sitter is significant - in most places baby sitters charge about $15 per hour so that is at least $60 on top of whatever expenses there are for a date. It is the reason why most two parent families don't get out that much and it is even more of a burden on a single parent household because they don't have a SO to keep them company. Even most divorced parents have nights when the other parent has custody - unless of course the other parent is a complete deadbeat.", "No that wasn\u2019t cool what he did to you.

Not having sex in four years is a lame argument to get you to babysit.  Not gonna say your an AH, but your lack of sympathy is a bit mean especially since your partner wasn't opposed to babysitting.

Once things are less tight financially he can start thinking about dating and getting his pickle tickled.\n\nAlso, if you were really the only person your brother has around to watch your niece I think he needs to look into other child care options sooner rather than later.
