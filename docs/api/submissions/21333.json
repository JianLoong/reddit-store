So yea EVERYONE IS AN A on this particular day but YTA overall", "NTA if he has money for night out he has money for baby sitter.

Does it suck? A lot of times, yes, but that's part of being a parent. His lack of social and/or sex life isn't your problem. \nAs for causing a scene in front of the kid, that's on him.

But who just turns the back to his brother in such an extreme situation? I\u2019d do anything for my siblings as long as they don\u2019t take the piss and it doesn\u2019t change my life.

If he had done it multiple times before (left the kid there or taken advantage of the OPs generosity) then that would be different. \n\nBut yeah the brother is a bit tight not having a babysitter but the neice is 4 years old not a tiny baby.

Part of being a parent is coming to terms with the fact that your social and sex life will be compromised for the sake of your child.", "A good uncle.", "There is merit to that argument, but we don't know anything about the past and their situations.

Doesn't sound like he's a great brother, hope he never needs anything from his brother.", "I have, but that's still not an excuse to abandon a 4 year old in front of a house and just hope that someone is home and able to take care of her. To make it worse, he then didn't pick up his phone. What if the kid had walked into the street and got hit by a car? The brother has no legal ability to make medical decisions for his niece. \nWhat her father did could have EASILY resulted in his daughter's injury or death. That's why it's worth calling the cops over. If a parent is desperate enough to risk the life of their child, they're not in a fit state to be a parent.", "So the child should be punished for that until they are 18 by being stuck in foster care?", "true... I just see his post as saying..\"i dont want to be left alone with the kid\"...after 4 years of he feels like that, then he is missing out on not having a great relationship with the niece.", "Potentially yes.
