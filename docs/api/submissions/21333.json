So yea EVERYONE IS AN A on this particular day but YTA overall", "NTA if he has money for night out he has money for baby sitter.

Does it suck? A lot of times, yes, but that's part of being a parent. His lack of social and/or sex life isn't your problem. \nAs for causing a scene in front of the kid, that's on him.

You should NEVER drop off a kid at a door.

I am not experienced with kids but watching a four year old on an occasional basis isn't rocket science and actually can be kind of fun and pleasurable. It isn't like an infant that requires actual knowledgable care in terms of feeding and diaper changes. You can even just entertain a four year old by sticking them in front of some cartoons if you truly didn't want to make the slightest bit of effort. \n\nWhile no one should be forced to babysit and it certainly isn't an obligation because of biology most people in functional families do provide help to their siblings and parents and it is generally reciprocal when a family dynamic isn't warped or dysfunctional. Your brother is in a hard space raising a child without any kind of help from family or friends.\n\nAnd the expense of a baby sitter is significant - in most places baby sitters charge about $15 per hour so that is at least $60 on top of whatever expenses there are for a date. It is the reason why most two parent families don't get out that much and it is even more of a burden on a single parent household because they don't have a SO to keep them company.

Once things are less tight financially he can start thinking about dating and getting his pickle tickled.\n\nAlso, if you were really the only person your brother has around to watch your niece I think he needs to look into other child care options sooner rather than later.

I've even done that with my grandparents when dropping them off at their own home!!!", "It\u2019s insane to you because you weren\u2019t raised by trash.", "I'm so glad she's doing better now. Thank God. Thank her grandparents. That poor child. No, I take that back, that fortunate child that she was removed from that situation and placed in a better one.", "My first date with my current partner (during the heart of pandemic) was walking in a mall masked, grabbing fries to go to a gorgeous park, more walking and talking, and some old fashioned make out time in the car. LOL.  Free dates aren't a turn off if done well.  They're usually great ways to really get to know someone and see if you click.  And if you do.... you never know.  Brother could have found a girl willing to grab a nightcap at her place or his.", "I would add this, too:\n\nWe have a granddaughter a tad older than this.  Kids at this age do not do well sleeping over or visiting for an entire evening at a place, or with a person, that is unfamiliar for extended visits.\n\nHis daughter would be stressed out.  Who dates a guy who would allow that?", "I can\u2019t imagine at all having this sort of attitude towards my brother if he was in a similar circumstance. Maybe if he and the mother were just separated and he wanted a babysitter just for one of the nights he was supposed to have the kid I would agree with what you\u2019re saying. However given the circumstances here I would absolutely say it\u2019s very much \u201cbad\u201d to refuse to help a sibling at all under these circumstances unless you already just totally hate each other.", "Good on you for fighting back against the swarm of edge lord teens in this thread. Helping people who you love is good, actually. Fucking reddit...", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6xoro/meta_this_sub_is_moving_towards_a_value_system/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "Yup, thank you. Is OP obligated to watch the child? No absolutely not, but they are absolutely being an asshole.", "I HOPE they'll grow out of it. The children who comment in this sub depress me about the future. (That said, it is kind of cute that they think we can't tell they have limited life experience.)", "I've had rideshare drivers wait to make sure I got inside when it's late/bad weather...it's like 15 feet from the curb to my front door.", "but!  \nAre you sure, they were poor when the mom was there?", "\"allowed\" \n\ngood fuckin judgy grief... Everyone deserves to find happiness and a chance to find a partner if they so desire. What else should poor people not be \"allowed\" to do?", "How much of America lives in poverty? Are you saying that many people shouldn't be allowed to date. Delusional.", "Depends on the brother", "Glad you have a better relationship with your siblings than I have with mine. We live hundreds of miles apart for a reason, because of abuse and trauma and lack of respect of boundaries growing up. To THIS DAY she still doesn't respect boundaries and has shown up at my house on my property in attempts to get me to do things with her anyways. She has a daughter I've never met and Gods willing I never will.  \nMy sister is so fucking toxic to me, refuses to see it, and thinks because we're family that I'll some how change my mind and go back to her and my mothers abuse. If I wanted to be around them I would have bought a house in a state closer to them.", "I would help them find/pay for a babysitter but I just\nwouldnt want to do it myself", "I didn\u2019t even consider that. Poor OP\u2019s brother :( if only OP + family were half decent people he might be doing a bit better", "A kid that age isn't punished by having to entertain themselves for a few hours under supervision. Plus, who says OP is just getting laid? It's parenting 101 to keep your kid out of new relationships while they're growing, how would he accomplish that without someone looking over his kid?\n\nClearly the brother is still incredibly dumb for what he did but op is insufferable.", "OP is taking care of his mom who has Alzheimer's. He's got his hands full.", "and why the fuck is op obligated to ever feel like watching a kid thats not theirs????", "You can't pour from an empty cup. You can't just suck up all the shit and then somehow dole out rainbows to your kids. That's not how people work.", ">He is not an asshole for setting a boundary & demanding that others respect it.\n\nI disagree. It is perfectly possible to set and enforce boundaries that make you an AH.", "Maybe I've been too harsh. He's been a widow for four years, and nobody wants to die alone. He deserves to find love again. And while his behavior was unacceptable, a combo of grief and stress can make anyone snap. Also I don't have a clear picture of how supportive OP has been since his Sister in Law's death. If he has done squat, then this was the least he can do. \n\nI'm childfree myself, but that doesn't give me the excuse to let a father and daughter suffer. The dad shouldn't have to be dateless until his little girl is 17, and the daughter should be able to bond with her relatives. \n\nOP if you're reading this, don't push your relatives away. Never be afraid to speak your mind or express your discomfort, but your niece is family and it's better to establish your relationship with her now when she's young.", "And the child could easily wake up and see the date who she shouldn\u2019t even be meeting until they are together 6-12 months and are seriously considering a serious, long term relationship. A child shouldn\u2019t be subjected to a parade of random women", "us women have watched too much true crime to do that.", "Yeah, I'd sure as hell REALLY REALLY want to get laid if it had been four years. Why do you see a problem with that?", "He's probably been through that. Did you read the post? He said he hadn't had sex since his wife died in childbirth. 4 Years.", "Yeah but that's not the only option. My mom used to REQUIRE that her first date with a guy be \"as a friend\" with me out somewhere kid friendly. It let guys know up front who her priority was. If they weren't willing to go on a date where they KNEW they wouldn't get laid and KNEW they'd be playing with a kid the whole time, she knew they weren't for her. I didn't know that these were dates until I was older. I just thought my mom had really cool friends \ud83d\ude02\nIt worked out. She married a guy who is an amazing dad and has always treated me as if I were his own. They ended up with 2 more kids and he's a phenomenal father to them, as well. If your priorities are right, you can date with a kid just fine without needing a babysitter."]}
