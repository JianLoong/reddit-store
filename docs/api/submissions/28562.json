I was 2 when my dad came into my life. He and my mom met when I was about 1 and as soon as he came into my life he embraced me as his own and became my dad. We moved in with him a few months later. My dad had two sons who were 7 and 9 at this point. To me they were my brother's. My mom told me they were my brother's and encouraged me to see them as such and strive for a close sibling relationship. In my young little head I thought we were half siblings via dad, because I didn't know until years later that he was my stepdad.\n\nI so desperately wanted to be close to the boys but they never saw me as their sister. It used to break my heart. I would cry to mom about it and she would encourage me not to give up. Mostly the boys just ignored me but sometimes they would tell me to go away or they didn't want me to hang out with them. I used to get so upset about it and I would try to figure out ways to fix things. To make them want me. I even painted my hair brown when I was 5 or 6 thinking it was because I didn't look like them (blonde with blue eyes vs their brown hair and hazel eyes). I thought that might make them see that we were real siblings.\n\nI hated myself so much for not being good enough and doing stuff wrong. That was what I thought was going on. That I had done something wrong or was wrong. When I was 7 I did a dance class and we had a sibling dance coming up. I asked the boys to come and they said no. My mom helped me to make an invitation for them and everything. She told me to keep it when they said no and ask again. \n\nIt took me until 12 to realize we were stepsiblings and my dad was not my bio dad. I still didn't understand their rejection of me. I was in such a bad headspace. My dad adopting me when I was 16 didn't fix it either. Actually, it killed me when the boys didn't show up to the courthouse for the adoption and when they didn't show up for the party. I cried myself to sleep for a week after that.\n\nI ended up in a really bad relationship in my last two years of high school. I was seeking more love. When I moved out and went to college and started to spiral worse, my dad reached out and told me I needed help. I couldn't open up to him so he encouraged me to seek therapy. And it's because of therapy I now realize a lot more and my mental health and headspace improved so much.\n\nI was distant from mom for several years and only recently did we start talking more. I opened up to her about my struggles. She blamed the boys. But I told her that it wasn't their fault, it was hers. I said if she hadn't pushed me to chase them, if she'd been more truthful, if she'd gotten me help. I told her she had been the adult with the obligation to me, not two boys who didn't choose to have a stepsister. My mom said I wasn't being fair and she just tried to give me what I needed and the boys had no reason to reject me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696845769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173o38p/aita_for_blaming_my_mom_for_messing_me_up/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it's good to hear you are talking about it with your mom. Maybe you and your mom should talk to a therapist together. You see, I don't think she was purposely trying to hurt you but thought she was doing the right thing. Which she wasn't, obviously. But I think she needs someone from the outside to make her realise that.", "Sorry for the emotional toll this has had on you. As a stepfather myself, I have always tried to be upfront with my son about his biological father (left, and wants nothing to do with him now). Asks stuff like, \"Why is my hair dark brown?\" and i tell him \"because [bio-dad's name]'s hair is dark brown. \" It can be hard to watch him struggle with not being wanted by his bio-dad, and it could be easy for me to put it under the rug, but i choose not to and instead let him know that I'm here for him.\nI can understand the initial push to be close to be close to your stepbrothers, but once it was obvious, they didn't want a bar of it it should have been dropped (the pushing to be close). Sometimes pushing can make it worse, and just living as a family does more than some step-parents realise. In fact, because the boys were old enough for it, I'd have sat them down and asked what they wanted in terms of relationship and gone with that.\nAs long as you were respectful about it NTA for stating your opinion to your mum.", "I dont know how relevant this is, but FYI occasionally relationships between older and younger biological siblings may be just as bad.  Some older children may not want anything to do with younger siblings, maybe if there's a large age gap or there's some degree of parentification going on, or maybe if the older child just don't like having a screaming baby or demanding small child in their homes.\n\nIt's not that the younger child is unlovable or has done anything wrong, and it's not even necessarily a blended-family issue.  Some people just don't want small children around, and it's a damn shame when children feel that way, because they are not capable of expressing their feelings in ways that are appropriate or unhurtful.", "NAH. I\u2019m from a mixed family. My dad passed away when I was a baby and mum remarried. It\u2019s really hard to integrate families at times and it sounds like your mum tried everything to make it happen but the boys had each other and rejected the idea of another sibling. They\u2019re the assholes.\n\nCut your mum some slack.", "NTA - but your mom surely is.  Where was your SD during all of this?  Did he try to stop your mom from pushing yourself at your SB's?", "NTA.  Your mom messed up in many ways.", "NAH - I'm thinking the biggest issue when it came to your stepbrothers was simply the age gap. If I'm reading your post right, there are 5 and 7 years respectively between you and your stepbrothers. That means when you invited them to your dance, they were 12 and 14, and most boys don't want to go to a kid's function at that age. Add in the gender difference, and even if they'd been your full biological siblings, they still might've turned to each other for companionship and left you out.\n\nYour mom was dealing with a heartbroken little girl, along with whatever difficulties came with blending the families. Yes, ideally she would've gotten you some help when you were younger, but that's water under the bridge now. Blaming her for your stepbrothers' reactions won't help either of you if you're trying to mend your relationship with her. If you still want to go over this kind of thing with her, I would suggest asking your therapist if y'all can have a few joint sessions, as a mediator can work wonders here.", "NAH - you are fine op but i think so is your mom. teaching a child not to give up easily may be one of the most important things for a good life and strong character.\n\nmaybe she truly believed you could get the boys to see you as a sister, i dont think she was malicious in any way.\n\nyour dad seems like a champ though, maybe reach out to him and tell him you appreciate him :)\n- appreciation is an antidote to depression", "YTA.\n\nIt sucks about your troubles, but your mom did not mess you up. You are an adult, so your life and problems are entirely in your hands. \n\nI mean, I am not sure why you ever thought that someone who comes into your life later and has older kids was your biological dad. Nevertheless, that man loves you as his own, even though his children do not. You need to come to terms with that, and it is not your mom's fault they do not view you as their sister. That's just life. It is not the boys' fault, either. \n\nIt is not your mom's fault you got into a bad relationship, nor that you spiralled in college. The sooner you take responsibility for your life, the better your life will be.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "That's something I agree with. I think mom should have stopped pushing things. She kept encouraging me though and pushing me to push them and lying to me. It was rough.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. If the siblings were all full siblings, it's likely OP would have still been chasing after her brothers.
