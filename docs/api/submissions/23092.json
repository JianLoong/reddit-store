What OP is doing is the equivalent of asking a school shooting survivor to come to the hospital to support a relative that just got shot. And then punishing that school shooting survivor for not coming. And Anna is just 20, so that trauma is most likely quite recent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sense of entitlement has excluded your sister. You should have spoken to her to hear her perspective. You also need to respect her feelings even if you don't understand them.", "Edit: OP, YTA. Anna had something happen as a teen which resulted in her being infertile. Why Leah tried to force Anna into a situation that would be triggering or upsetting for her idk, but she had plenty of support at the hospital and had no right to demand that of Anna. OP none of this was your business to begin with but it says a lot about you that you decided to further manipulate and shame someone you claim to care about. Anna is better off not attending your wedding with these people. I\u2019d be done with all of you. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is enough information here. Even in your comment on why she didn\u2019t come, you didn\u2019t give Anna\u2019s reason for not going.

Weddings are not so special and important that your guests are lucky to be invited. I know people tend to have this belief and it sort of skews relations to weddings but to be clear: weddings are a special day for the bride and groom, everyone attending is doing them a favor by celebrating their day with them. They\u2019re not being treated, they\u2019re doing the treating. For most guests weddings are just okay. So the weird way that people sometimes like to treat an invitation to their wedding as some kind of amazing gift that people need to earn is just really crass and generally bad manners.", "I N F O\n\nSome people just can't handle hospitals, and Anna is a good deal younger than the two of you.  \n\nDid you all discuss ***why*** she didn't come?\n\n-----\n\nYTA\n\nYou left out that ***she's infertile***.

You've used both to describe this.  \n\nSo what's the core reason for the baby aversion?   You said she's a half sibling - did a mother die in the family?  Does she have issues with her mother?  Did something happen regarding babies?  Does the family at large ask her about when she's going to have a baby often?", "Soooo before everyone dogpiles Anna because \"she isn't there during a traumatic time\" please factor in that OP omitted the fact that due to an incident she is unable to have kids and THAT is why she isn't comfortable interacting with maternity issues.

You are still being vague, but safe to assume it was either a serious illness or traumatic accident. Instead of respecting your younger sister's boundaries, your family tried to bully her into visiting your older sister in the hospital and then attacked her when she wouldn't.

TRAUMA!! Meaning that hospitals, children/babies, stillbirths/miscarriages, etc. can be extremely triggering for her! And it sounds like you and your family can\u2019t be even slightly sympathetic. SHE WAS A TEEN GOING THROUGH THAT!! \n\nAnd in your original post you say that Anna feels that you all dogpiled onto her. Did you all blame her for what happened??? Victim-blaming is not a love language girl, and your family gaslighting and guilt tripping her is crazy ESPECIALLY considering what is happening to Leah is along the same vein!\n\nI hope Anna cuts you all off as she is probably coming to realize how you all have treated her both during and after her traumatic event because this is INSANE to me!", "**Mega YTA.**\n\nThis is one of those where it seems like you're not.\n\nThen you read some of your comments:\n\n1.

Being vague as possible and leaving it seem like anna was totally non-chalant about the situation, instead of saying something general about the situation (i.e. \"Due to some [incredibly] related trauma, anna doesn't feel comfortable.....), you can twist the narrative to fit Princess Leah's needs.\nYour family just hates Anna admit it.

Anna has suffered a serious trauma and can\u2019t face certain situations because of it. She is allowed to have boundaries to protect herself. Leah decided to use her own trauma in an attempt to force Anna to face it or look like an AH to others, and she got exactly what she wanted because she\u2019s spoiled. You, also being spoiled, decided to then use your wedding as a stick to batter Anna about not bowing to Leah\u2019s demands. I can see why you\u2019re closer to Leah, you both have a habit of using your personal situations as a way to manipulate people. None of you, extended to your wider family, has ever cared about Anna and you lied about thinking of her the same as your other siblings. Your behavior proves that isn\u2019t true. Anna was 100% correct about Princess Leah thinking the world revolves around her and you\u2019re all enablers. \n\nWhen Leah said she wouldn\u2019t come to the wedding if Anna came the only appropriate response was, \u201cI am sorry to hear that, unfortunately we won\u2019t be involved in you using your trauma to bully our sister.

Don't continuously push people if you don't want them to snap at you.   \n\nThere are some issues where it's ok to excuse yourself from being the one to comfort someone when you know they have a big network with them.  In hospitals and involving babies are some of those subjects.  Those are very touchy subjects and people need to understand that not everyone can be a comfort person for every subject.  \n\nAdd on that it appears she's a non-traditional student and working, there's a good chance she literally didn't have the time or emotional capacity right now to be someone else's support.

Leah just spent all that time turning the family against her and making her the villain. I would have told her to feel better but go kick rocks.
