Would it require her taking off work? Does she have her own obligations that she would have to drop to be there?\n\nOP's vagueness on the reasons the sister didn't show up make me suspect they might be justified reasons. Especially since the rest of the family was already there to support her.", "NTA\n\nAnna has shown that she has no compassion for her sister in a terribly difficult moment for her. Even if they had differences, now was the time to put them aside.", "NTA, it's your wedding and you get to choose who attends. If she isn't going to be there for the rough parts of your life why would you want her there for the best days?", "\" we've all been pretty close. \"  \"Me and Anna are also not as close and don't talk much.\"  So which is it?  Your wedding you can invite whoever you want but this is coming off as petty.", "YTA. You sister had support at the hospital. Your younger sister was not obligated to be at the hospital. Your sense of entitlement has excluded your sister. You should have spoken to her to hear her perspective. You also need to respect her feelings even if you don't understand them.", "I don\u2019t think there is enough INFO here. Even in your comment on why she didn\u2019t come, you didn\u2019t give Anna\u2019s reason for not going. You\u2019re supposed to do your best to present both sides of the situation in this sub so you should probably edit and give a less biased explanation before it\u2019s removed.\n\nTo the other points. Weddings are not so special and important that your guests are lucky to be invited. I know people tend to have this belief and it sort of skews relations to weddings but to be clear: weddings are a special day for the bride and groom, everyone attending is doing them a favor by celebrating their day with them. They\u2019re not being treated, they\u2019re doing the treating. For most guests weddings are just okay. So the weird way that people sometimes like to treat an invitation to their wedding as some kind of amazing gift that people need to earn is just really crass and generally bad manners. \n\nIf Anna couldn\u2019t make it to the hospital, or if there are issues between her and Leah, that\u2019s unfortunate. If Leah has an issue with her because of this incident, that\u2019s also unfortunate. You inserting yourself into all of that is probably not the best. Try having a conversation rather than this passive aggression maybe? Without more information that\u2019s the best I can say. \n\nI would also suggest that you and Leah are probably unaware of Anna\u2019s history with pregnancy. She may have suffered a miscarriage or similar and that is why she was uncomfortable. In which case, it may have been safer for her mental health to support Leah from a distance. If they were close and Anna didn\u2019t show up, I would probably assume there is a very good reason and your closeness and sympathy with Leah may be causing you to judge her unfairly. Until you know the full story seems a bit premature to be so harsh.", "INFO\n\nSome people just can't handle hospitals, and Anna is a good deal younger than the two of you.   \n\nDid you all discuss ***why*** she didn't come?", "As she has to live with the consequences of her actions, so will you.  So look down the road, and as long as you never want to have any relationship with her then don\u2019t invite her.  However, if years from now you have kids, she has kids, and they will never be able to interact\u2026.you may want to suck it up buttercup and put out the olive branch.", "Why couldn\u2019t she visit in the hospital? A recent pandemic? Traumatizing reasons regarding the stillbirth? Distance? Unavailability? You are really  blowing this out of proportion. Again you are not forced to invite anyone you don\u2019t want to your wedding. But it\u2019s not even your hill to die on.", "Info - what reasons did Anna give for not showing up?", "NTA\n\n>she's shown she can't be there for us during the worst times\n\nThere you have it. \n\n>Most of my family is on my side though.\n\nI think if they are on your side, and they know the situation better than us, that shows you that you're right.", "Your wedding, do what you want. NTA.", "Yeah, exactly. I'd want to hear stuff here. I can imagine Anna, being the youngest by far, being overwhelmed by the circumstances of a stillbirth and not being able to face it, and later lashing out for being excluded instead of admitting weakness. But I can also imagine Anna, being the youngest by far, not wanting to miss a concert and a party that weekend because what's-his-face would be there. And which it is does matter.", "She was at home, I guess. I know she didn't have work then. All of us live within 20-30 mins of each other. Leah was really upset and hurt Anna didn't bother coming even after she personally talked to her. I'd also called her before that. Then Anna said all those things about how Leah's making everyone gang up on her and that the world doesn't revolve around princess Leah", "Yeah, that was my thought too. It's hard to believe that they were in the same town, Anna had nothing going on, and she just said she doesn't want to come to the hospital. It's too vague for me to give a verdict", ">OP's vagueness on the reasons the sister didn't show up make me suspect they might be justified reasons.\n\nThis was my thought - there was another recent post about a family guilting & shaming someone to do something and the general sense was support at the boundary drawn with the family. These things are situational.\n\nAs for the wedding, who cares, do what you want.", "According to Op she didn't work and they all live at 20-30 min distance from each other. She just said she doesn't want to come because the world doesn't revolve around princess leah", "I meant we were all pretty close up until this happened", "> your sense of entitlement has excluded your sister\n\nWanting your sibling to be there for your other sibling in a very very TRAUMATIC and DIFFICULT time is entitlement? If you feel that, you\u2019re either an only child or you don\u2019t have supportive siblings. SHE caused everyone to exclude her when she decided to not emotionally support her sister at a time when she needed support from her entire family.", "The thing here is that Leah is very upset. I don't want to upset her even more. Since me and Anna have drifted apart as well after this, I thought it'd be best not to invite her. Leah said she wouldn't come if Anna did and my parents are also saying Leah's going through a lot of grief and I should listen to her.", "She said she didn't want to and wasn't comfortable going to the hospital", "Is she afraid of hospitals maybe? Prior trauma, germophobia etc.\n\nIt\u2019s still hard for me to believe that she just said \u201cI don\u2019t wanna come\u201d without giving any explanation why.", "Hard to pass judgment here, a stillbirth is absolutely terrible and a lot of grief to be processed. It sounds like there\u2019s some underlying issues going on between siblings. The wedding has nothing do with the loss or either sibling. Leah\u2019s saying she won\u2019t go if Anna does and everyone falling into line makes Anna\u2019s point that the family revolves things around \u201cprincess Leah. Don\u2019t make a rash decision based on the feelings of others, wedding isn\u2019t for several months give it all some time and then decide what you OP want. Not inviting one sister is something that cannot be undone after the wedding is over and you might regret it years later.", "The wedding is next year.  Why not table it for awhile.  Sometimes time changes things, sometimes not.", "Why wasn't she comfortable going to the hospital?", "No she's not scared of hospitals, she's gone to see other friends and family. She doesn't like baby/maternity related things so she refused to come", "Yeah that's not a bad idea. I just feel stuck right now because Leah's upset and I don't want to her hurt her more", "She's usually fine with hospitals, she's gone to visit other family. She doesn't like baby related things so she said she won't come.", "> She doesn't like baby/maternity related things so she refused to come\n\nDo you know why that is?", "There's a difference between not liking something and being uncomfortable with it.  You've used both to describe this.  \n\nSo what's the core reason for the baby aversion?   You said she's a half sibling - did a mother die in the family?  Does she have issues with her mother?  Did something happen regarding babies?  Does the family at large ask her about when she's going to have a baby often?"]}
