I've had this same type of scenario, and I did the work, beyond the contract. Why? Because that's what I do, and I got referred. You're also playing with fire with your personal relationships. Half of the time you have the same things happening with regular clients and will loss business if you're such a stickler on contact abiding. Contracts should be in place to protect you from any legal issues, not to terminate a friend of a friend.  \n\n\nAfter the first okay from the client, state that any further changes come with additional charges and a complete redesign will be also cost. Actually say it to the client and don't leave it to the contract to explain. Most don't really read the contract anyway.   \n\n\nThe other fault I see in designers is that they feel what they made meets the clients' needs.

What a clever way to be kind, and have documentation of services provided. Also, low stakes reminder that you have professional boundaries.", "Yes consultancy is exhausting.", "Story of my life, amirite? *So* many assholes", "NTA - You had a contract, you fulfilled said contract, you even went outside the original contract for 1 free complete revision.  You don't owe the other 3 free revisions unless of course she want to pay you double for the double amount of work that it will take in the end.  If so, Then, pay up 'friend'. Be more than happy to accommodate you once you pay for the two.", "NTA", "nta", "NTA.\n\n\"The client you referred me is an entitled pain-in-the-ass, who refused to adhere to the contract we signed. There is no question she is asshole here.", "Don't you know that if your MIL recommends you to a friend that means YOU work for FREE for the rest of your LIFE.  nta", "NTA, you refer a friend to a relative because you want them to have a good service, not so they can try to take advantage of your relatives.", "NTA - she's taking advantage of you", "You know you're not. Your only mistake was accepting the out of scope work in the first instance.", "op=nta\n\nbut lesson learned--do not take familial recommendations.  And if you do--don't make exceptions.  \n\nWhen she wanted to change the final-APPROVED-stuff, you should have told her THEN that it would cost her X more for changes and made her sign a new contract.", "Soft YTA, but you were mostly TA to yourself. I\u2019m also a self-employed graphic designer and can see so many ways you could have worked through this and instead you took an unnecessarily hardline (and shortsighted) approach. Now the client is out a bunch of money and has no branding, but also you are out a bunch of money for a job you did finish and have a big headache on your hands. Part of our role as designers and small business owners is to clearly communicate pricing and work scope to the client. You did that at the start but then threw your own agreement out the window. It\u2019s clear you just got fed up and didn\u2019t want to deal any more, but effectively dealing with difficult clients is part of the job and is what will give you the most longevity in this business (more so than actual talent TBH). Next time remind the client of the work scope before the redesign, then if you do the redesign and it needs revisions then rework the contract to include the cost of revisions. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t any room to ever fire clients - I\u2019ve done this as well. But I think if you do you need to be prepared to eat the whole project cost. I can\u2019t think of a time when I ever took 50% of a project cost from a client then didn\u2019t deliver them any files. That\u2019s just asking to be badmouthed.", "NTA. It\u2019s always a crap shoot working for relatives and relatives friends. However, you bent over backwards and MIL friend is taking advantage of you. Nope.", "NTA\u2026 she was trying to take advantage", "NTA\n\nThis is business.  Your MIL's friend is abusing the connection she has and taking you for granted.  If these are the kinds of clients your MIL is swinging your way, tell her thanks, but no thanks.", "Oh hell no!\n\nSeems to me like you provided all the requisite services per the contract and even went beyond the initial agreement.  You were well within your rights to terminate the contract.    \nAnd as to your MIL, tell her it was strictly business, bad business at that and if she don't like it, she can kiss your ass!", "Nope - but instead of firing her you could have told her that per the contract she had 3 choices. You accomodated 1 additional change because of her relationship with MIL, which you will NEVER do again and the fact that she is asking for more is appalling.\n\nYou've delivered your end of the bargain, now she can choose between those 4.", "Yep. I feel like this person was NEVER going to make up their mind and pay the second half of the fee.", "Yes, this is what should have been done. It\u2019s a harsh move to take 50% then walk away and leave client with nothing", "What is the purpose of utilizing the redesigns on a design she loved? Why would that not be the final?", "Retail IT is always a nightmare. Business less so.  \n\n\nOne of my worst was a neighbour who bought a brand new Commodore 64 (yes I'm old) from the place I worked and got the hump after I told him on my 5th and last visit that he would need to bring it back to the shop or pay for my time. He tried the \"We are friends and neighbours\" card and I pointed out that other than a vague smile, when we occasionally saw each other that we hadn't spoken a word before he bought the thing.", "My friends and family fee is at least double any other consulting fees I charge.", "NTA, Your mother in law needs to realize your running a business, not a favor for her friends.\n\nWhat does your MIL do for a living, and will she do it for you?", "NTA \nIf she wanted more revisions she will have to pay full price again because she is making you do 2 logos with 6 revisions (3 on each logo) you don\u2019t change direction and expect to change until your happy with endless revisions that\u2019s not how it works. Once the first logo is okayed that\u2019s it you have the 3 revisions and anything else will be addition payment.", "NTA.\n\nShe should be grateful that you even did that without entering into a NEW contract and should explain that because she is requesting new revisions, you would need to open a new contract.", "NTA she hasn't paid!", "NTA. Just because people are related, or are close, taking advantage like this is the worst thing. Sure I\u2019d accommodate a bit more than I would for a normal person, but not that much more.", "Nta this is business.", "Kinda? Hard to say. You should have stated that, as it was a new design, it requires payment in full of the previous works and a new contract. Or at the very least payment for new works. When she demanded 3 new revisions, you could also have done this. Instead it looks like you just shut everything down and refused to talk to her, which is not great behaviour. So unless you tried to re-negotiate, I'd say NTA.\n\nEdit - read your comments. You tried to renegotiate, but were dealing with an AH. Not on you!", "Your former client is a mooch. NTA", "You didn't \"fire her friend\".\n\nYou fired a difficult client.\n\nYou're NTA.\n\nBut the former client is.\n\nand so is your MIL for getting involved in something that doesn't concern her.", "NTA You have her four revisions when she only paid for three. She's lucky you didn't ask for full payment when you did 125% of the job.", "I wouldn't be surprised if they were messing with you to try and upset you or waste your time. Testing you or bullying you in some way. I know how in laws can be. NTA", "Here we go, my wife will discuss and issue an additional invoice with it due immediately if you want to proceed.\n\nNTA"]}
