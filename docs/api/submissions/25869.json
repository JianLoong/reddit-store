They said it was because they had to put all the numbers in.\n\nSince it was billed at hourly, I asked for the timesheets.  They showed me people working on it for 12 hour days.  Obviously, this was a group of accountants sitting in a room working on dozens of clients and billing it out to all of them.  \n\nAs per our agreement, I determined to take it to arbitration.
