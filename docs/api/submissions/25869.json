There is always something. Be 100% sure she will use that design, though. Even if it was watermarked, some cousin's nephew's nerdy neighbor will vectorize it. \n\nLesson learned. NEVER work with family or friends. Not for money. MAYBE over coffee with a sketchpad and a pencil.", "NTA.    Your contract clearly states what you give in return for a fee. MIL is an AH", "So NTA.\n\nYou have a signed contract which she changed. (you really should have had a signed change control order at this point). Just because she massively changed her mind doesn't reset the revisions provision of the original contract. Insisting on that is breaching the original contract. You were correct to halt work. \n\nIf she wants the product she can sign a new contract which may or may not include revisions.", "This is a business dispute.\n\nMiL isn't involved.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Did you explain the client\u2019s behaviour to your MIL?", "NTA assuming the client had full understanding they were requesting way beyond the contract limitations.\n\nYour MIL needs to understand that her friend tried to take advantage of you by leveraging your relationship with her against the contract. You were really patient with her - did far more than I would have.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I do think you could have handled it better. Had it been me, I would have pointed out that you have already gone beyond the contract by doing the extra work because she was a friend of your MIL and as far as you were concerned the contract was completed and she would get the work on completion of payment. If she wanted more revisions, then you would be happy to treat the extra work as a new contract.\n\nAs it stands, you've only been paid for half the original work and wasted your time doing the extra work.", "NTA doesn\u2019t matter how she came to you, you even gave her a free complete redesign. You are fully in your rights to terminate the contract.", "INFO - did you explain the process to this client? Did you offer to redesign the second logo for an additional cost? I get that she was difficult. She was asking for a lot of extra work, but was it out of ignorance or out of not being able to make up her mind and taking advantage of the situation? By keeping half of her money and giving her nothing, both of you have every right to find justification in being hurt, angry, and taken advantage of.", "NTA, you did more than you would have for any normal customer.", "NTA. She acted entitled and you shut that down, good for you.", "NTA", "Possibly.\n\nWhat would she say? Was the first iteration of the design not good? Honestly? If so, maybe she deserved the three additional revisions too.\n\nNever work with friends/family", "Yes, YTA. You could have simply explained to her that you were already working beyond the scope of the original contract, and that if she wants more rounds of revisions, she'll have to pay the going hourly rate. But you went nuclear instead.", "You have made 3 mistakes. 1. You accepted her change of course without objecting and telling her. How can you expect that she understands that you made a favor to her? Does she have psychic powers? 2. You cut the deal without negotiation. This is not a good business approach. 3. You asked this to redditors, most of whom have no idea about how to manage a business. This is not an argument between friends.
