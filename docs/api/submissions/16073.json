{"id": 16073, "submission_id": "133y01y", "title": "AITA for ruining my brother's relationship because i wanted his girlfriend to be more involved with our family?", "selftext": "I (28f) always had a great relationship with my brother (38m) and the rest of my family. When my son (now 5) was born, they supported me through a lot, especially since my baby's father abandoned us. \n\nThe problem started when he met his girlfriend (30s)in university. At the start, i was truly happy for him, especially since he'd talk to me about wanting to ask her out ever since he heard of her from her classmates. what i didn't like is that she didn't care much to keep contact with us, even after being together for well over a year. she was always too busy to meet our family.\n\nHe told me she was an amazing cook, was kind, brilliant, etc. and he wanted to marry her and travel with her back to her country once she finished her phd. He'd always talk to us about how lucky he was to be dating her (she's a judge) and how her government was financing her. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \n\nI wanted her to be more involved in our family, but there was always an excuse as to why she couldn't meet us for dinners, etc. She'd be studying, helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?), and on the rare occasions she was free, she was either travelling to see her family, hosting friends or wanted to be alone. I didn't buy that she didn't have any time for us because she doesn't work and was always at home, but she stopped accepting my visits and refused anything to do with my son as well, which slowly distanced my brother. she wouldn't even babysit when my parents were out of town and i needed her to watch him so i could work. personally, i don't think she's as kind as my brother thought. \n\nMy parents were on my side, brother wanted to be \"neutral\", but asked us to not \"stress her out even more\". A few days ago, me and my parents went to her house to talk things out with them both. We were upset, but tried our best to explain why her distance and refusal to help was unacceptable since she doesn't work and has free time, i told her i wished she'd be more caring and she got increasingly angrier, but said nothing. Then she turned to my brother and asked him if he agreed, but he said he didn't want to take sides. She said that this was \"another example of why she felt so resistant to the idea of getting into a relationship\", that \"she couldn't take it anymore and felt better being alone\" and then broke up with him. I was shocked, none of us expected this and my brother immediately tried to backtrack, but she told all of us to leave her house immediately and to not go back. \n\nNow i'm feeling guilty and my brother won't speak to us because i ruined his relationship and she's irreducible. She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family and I'm afraid there's no way to fix this. AITA or did she overreact?", "created_utc": 1682876220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133y01y/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_relationship_because/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep repeating that to yourself until it gets through to you.", "YTA. You confronted your adult brother\u2019s adult girlfriend about how you think she should spend her free time,  and because she doesn\u2019t want to babysit your kid or spend time with you.  Why would you even think she\u2019s obligated to do any of these things? Your family sounds pushy and needy and I\u2019m not surprised she ended things.", "YTA. A meddling, jealous asshole. Grow up and work on yourself.", "YTA here, easily. Your brother's sig ificant other is not a babysitting service.", "Wow YTA x 1000\n\nWhere do you get off demanding a random person babysit your kid because you don't have a back up? and then staging some sort of weird intervention because you think this person you don't have a relationship with isn't doing enough for your family.\n\nI feel bad for your brother as you've pushed away the only sane person in his life but feel glad for the poor GF because she's escaped the toxic insanity of you and your parents.\n\nYou owe your brother a massive apology and you need some sort of therapy to address whatever this mess is", ">but she stopped accepting my visits\n\nINFO: So she did accept some visits?\n\n>she's a judge\n\nShe is working.\n\nAlso, PhDs are incredibly difficult and time extensive. It can be a full time job within itself, with focus needing to be on graduating with the best education possible so as to use the knowledge in her career. This is in addition to the work she may do currently as a judge.\n\n>helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?)\n\nSee: \"She's a judge\"\n\nVideo conferences are completely normal and possible to do. They have been done even more often by professionals since covid. As a judge it is entirely possible she could be giving advice and support to people overseas via a video chat.\n\n>she wouldn't even babysit\n\n**She is valid on that** and it is not unusual.\n\nShe is a busy professional, and her job is her school. She should not be expected to babysit (Also, school is stressful, PARTICULARLY at the PhD level. Time off is valued when it can be received and it would be no wonder if she did not want to lose what little alone time she had to babysitting). Even if she were to have married in, it's not something in-laws should be expected to do. Would it be nice for them to do? Yes if they are able and willing, but it shouldn't be expected.\n\n\\---\n\nWhen it comes to getting to know the family:\n\nCould be a cultural difference thing, could also not be. A significant other should be willing to at least try to get to know the family a little bit and allow family to keep connections. ESPECIALLY if there are any plans of the brother leaving the country with her, as he would want to keep connection with his family.\n\nHeavily interested in knowing which country the person is from.", "YTA. \n\nI'm a little confused by the timeline; you say she's unemployed, a judge and a PHD student. Regardless, it sounds like she has a lot on, alongside the other reasons (not excuses) she's been busy.\n\nBased on her response it sounds like it was something your brother and his GF have spoken about and she's made it clear that she's a really busy person. \n\nI've been the \"I'm too busy to be in a relationship\" person who has then been talked into a relationship, and then reprimanded for not having enough time for the undisclosed commitments that followed, and it sucks feeling like you're not doing enough when you're doing your best.\n\nSounds like she'd made it clear to your brother that she was too busy to meet the expectations your family were setting for her, and then when you guys essentially told her off for it, he didn't stick up for her, even though he'd asked you \"not to stress her out even more\" (i.e. she's already stressed/upset about this) and you ignored that. Then when she looked to her partner for support, he did nothing. Neutrality = on nobody's side, not on everybody's side. \n\nSounds like she got sick of hearing that she's not making enough of an effort or not caring enough when she's clearly just exhausted.\n\n\n(Edit: correcting punctuation/phrasing)", "YTA:  In what world do you think you get to dictate how your brother's partner have to behave.  If she doesn't want to have a close relationship with you that's up to her and it's up to your brother to decide if it's a deal breaker or not. \n\nYou had no reason to sit her down and try to enforce rules on her.  Seems like you let your jealousy ruin a good relationship", "YTA. And a jealous petty one at that.", "YTA. You barged into her home, had a go at her (for..having her own life? For not being at your beck and call? I have no idea honestly) and your brother blew it by not taking the opportunity to set a boundary and standing up for her.\n\nSaying someone who is doing a PhD 'doesn't work' is so unbelievably disrespectful.", "YTA. Who were any of you to tell her that \u201cher distance and refusal to help was unacceptable\u201d? Utterly ridiculous behaviour, and your brother was spineless for not backing up his partner in the face of such nonsense.", "YTA\n\nA sibiling's significant other is under no obligation to be close with the other's family.\n\nThis woman gave you MANY hints (her unavailability) that she was not interested a the close relationship with the family.\n\nYou pushed and she pushed back and your brother is out in the cold.\n\nYour brother, by \"staying neutral\" gave her the clear message that he wanted her to have a closer relationship with his family than she was comfortable with.\n\nHopefully, he can find someone who will be at your beck and call to babysit and do whatever else you deem necessary to be a contributing family member before marriage.\n\nGood Luck", "Yeaaah YTA\n\nI get wanting a relationship with your siblings partner but you're jealous and pissed she won't babysit.\n\n\nSo\n\n\nYTA", "YTA Why the fuck do you think you are entitled to any of her time? Who the fuck are you? They weren't married. She doesn't owe you a fucking thing. Relationships with people are a choice. You can't force them, and she was obviously correct in her assumption that there was a reason to keep distance from your family. You say you're not clouded by jealousy, but that is obviously untrue.", "\u201c. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \u201c\n\nWTF does the above have to do with you? YTA and you\u2019re jealous AF. You chose to have a baby, grow up and stop expecting others to look after it.", "YTA. You sound really jealous of her lifestyle and opportunities.\n\nYou chose to become a mother at a fairly young age. It's great that you have some family support, but dating your brother doesn't mean someone's signing on to babysit. Your kid is your responsibility. And studying for a graduate degree IS work, whether or not you respect it.\n\nYour brother is right to cut you off. His mistake here was not stepping in to protect his ex from your demands before she got sick of your entitled, condescending attitude. That woman deserves better, so hopefully she'll eventually find a partner who'll have her back.\n\nWhen you say, \"She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family,\" that makes it sound like y'all are still hassling this poor woman? Leave her the hell alone. You've already screwed things up; piling on at this point just makes it more clear that you have no sense of boundaries so she's right to get away from you.", "YTA so to summarise her success stung you a little then how is her not being more involved with you make you dislike her she's allowed to be busy plus she's not obliged to make time for the family she's dating your brother not all of you , you are entitled in asking her to babysit for you , you could hire a babysitter for a couple of hours if your parents cannot babysit the kid", "YTA, you can ASK for help, but you can\u2019t demand it just because she\u2019s dating your brother. And the way you talk about her\u2026 you\u2019re completely ignorant of her having her own life and not come running, just because you assume because she doesn\u2019t have a job she MUST have the time to babysit your child? One year is not anywhere near enough for your family to act this controlling over her. Also, nowhere in your text did you say that you did anything for her, you only demanded things, acted selfishly and wondered, why she wouldn\u2019t want to meet you all. And then you went to her house, because she didn\u2019t act the way you wanted?? Nah gurl, you totally invaded her privacy because you were jealous and wanted her to work more for her life. I\u2019ll say this very blunt but you destroyed your brothers relationship out of pure delusion. If I was you, I\u2019d do everything to apologize to her and tell her, that your brother was in the difficulties situation of having to decide between his family and her, thereby it was all your fault. It\u2019s the least you can do.", "YTA\n\nShe's not obligated to waste her free time on you and she's smart for dumping your spineless loser brother\n\nYou're all obnoxious", "Yta. This is all over the place. She wouldn't meet you but accepted visits? She's not working but getting her PhD? You wanted his relationship to materially benefit you and interfered when it didn't. That was a shit thing to do to your brother.", "Delusion is strong in this sub today! Definitely YTA. She is doing a PhD, so she is clearly doing some work. You are not entitled to her time. What is wrong with you and your parents thinking that you can go and demand things of your adult brother's girlfriend?", "YTA. Stop forcing your opinions on your brother and his SO. Just because *you* would like them to be more involved with your family does not obligate them to want that themselves. And being upset because she didn't watch your kids? She's not your babysitter and it's certainly not her responsibility to be available to babysit whenever you need. That does not make her unkind. You put too much pressure on her/your brother needlessly and essentially sabotaged his relationship.\n\nI hope you learn from this to mind your own business and respect that your brother is an adult and will make his own choices in regards to how much or little he is involved in your family, how a SO impacts that, etc.", "YTA. You sabotaged his relationship because you were jealous of his gf.

Do us all a favor and reread this post. You\u2019re literally mad because she won\u2019t watch your son. That\u2019s not her responsibility.

Expecting her to do so because she doesn't work? Woaah how entitled are you? You are not her family. And even if your were, she would not be remotely obliged. \n\nThat she doesn't work is none of your concern or business and you sound EXTREMELY jealous.

She dodged and ENTIRE family of red flags.", "Your brother's a grown man and you don't know what arrangement him and her had.

She was dating your brother, not his entire family.\n\nI do find it funny that you want to spend time with her, have her be part of your family experiences, and babysit yet you obviously don't like her.

Luke how dare this judge to spend her rare free time visiting her own family instead of watching her flings sisters child? I'd like to roll my eyes audibly on that one.\nAlso, y'all surprised her in her downtime and brought stress into her home/safespace. Who would like to put up with that?\n\nAbout the brother: I'd totally would've dumped him, too. He ignored his girlfriends needs when she needed him to support her against all the BS OP and her parents pulled up. This was an unprepared 3 vs 1, after all.

When my son (now 5) was born, they supported me through a lot, especially since my baby's father abandoned us. \n\nThe problem started when he met his girlfriend (30s)in university. At the start, i was truly happy for him, especially since he'd talk to me about wanting to ask her out ever since he heard of her from her classmates. what i didn't like is that she didn't care much to keep contact with us, even after being together for well over a year. she was always too busy to meet our family.\n\nHe told me she was an amazing cook, was kind, brilliant, etc. and he wanted to marry her and travel with her back to her country once she finished her phd. He'd always talk to us about how lucky he was to be dating her (she's a judge) and how her government was financing her. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \n\nI wanted her to be more involved in our family, but there was always an excuse as to why she couldn't meet us for dinners, etc. She'd be studying, helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?), and on the rare occasions she was free, she was either travelling to see her family, hosting friends or wanted to be alone. I didn't buy that she didn't have any time for us because she doesn't work and was always at home, but she stopped accepting my visits and refused anything to do with my son as well, which slowly distanced my brother. she wouldn't even babysit when my parents were out of town and i needed her to watch him so i could work. personally, i don't think she's as kind as my brother thought. \n\nMy parents were on my side, brother wanted to be \"neutral\", but asked us to not \"stress her out even more\". A few days ago, me and my parents went to her house to talk things out with them both. We were upset, but tried our best to explain why her distance and refusal to help was unacceptable since she doesn't work and has free time, i told her i wished she'd be more caring and she got increasingly angrier, but said nothing. Then she turned to my brother and asked him if he agreed, but he said he didn't want to take sides. She said that this was \"another example of why she felt so resistant to the idea of getting into a relationship\", that \"she couldn't take it anymore and felt better being alone\" and then broke up with him. I was shocked, none of us expected this and my brother immediately tried to backtrack, but she told all of us to leave her house immediately and to not go back. \n\nNow i'm feeling guilty and my brother won't speak to us because i ruined his relationship and she's irreducible. She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family and I'm afraid there's no way to fix this. AITA or did she overreact?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That would be so disrespectful to her employer.", "Aka she\u2019s studying and it isn\u2019t her responsibility to babysit your kid", "But she\u2019s still in a PhD program, right? That\u2019s hardly nothing", "But you said she also works as a judge.", "I'm really lost on what to say. yta.", "It takes some genuine simple mindedness to make the kind of decisions you and your family made", "Yeah she\u2019s on Paid leave from her job because she was WORKING to get her PhD.", "She is being paid to get her doctorate.  That\u2019s work.", "She's being paid for studying and getting her degree. You think it's easy to get degrees?", "Getting a PhD is a full time job. She\u2019s doing more than you are, clearly.", "So she's pursuing a higher degree, yet you think you're entitled to her time to watch your kids that you chose to have? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Why is she responsible for your children? Matter of fact why are your parents responsible for your children? It's none of your business what she's doing with her time, as it is her life not yours. You are not her, you are not her parent. You are not entitled to anything from her. You aren't in a relationship with her. Your children have no relationship with her. Even if they did, they still wouldn't be entitled to her time. Get over yourself. You cost your brother a relationship, and that's probably going to damage yours with him as well.", "A phd is a full time job, and then some", "OK for the hard of thinking, which you are\n\nDoing a degree is working. Doing a PhD is very hard work.", "YTA. Even she just spends her time twiddling her thum it's non of your business. She's not obligated to help you or your family just because she's dating your brother. What kindn8f thinking is that? Even.if she was your brother's wife, she can do whatever she wants. You had no business forcing her to help you. I pity the woman who will eventually marry your brother. What an entitled people you and your parents are", "So something far more productive than being the unpaid nanny for you.\n\nYour kid your responsibility. She had her own life and didn\u2019t need obnoxious in-laws especially with a weak spined significant other.  \n\nAlso it\u2019s 2023 not all women are mothers. And lead fulfilling lives and have free time.", "Which means she's got a lot of pressure on her to study. She'll have to spend a lot of time on that.", "Going to school is work\u2026. Clearly you haven\u2019t gone to school lol", "Jeez OP.  Getting a degree is pretty much a full time job.  \n\nIf someone else is PAYING you to get a degree, that is even more true.  They will absolutely want the degree finished in a cost-effective timeframe, no messing around.\n\nSo yes, she IS working.  YTA.  \n\nAnd I'm kinda betting you decided you didn't like her from the start, she picked up on that, and decided to prioritize her personal time over her relationship with you.  \n\nI mean, if you have such dislike for her, why chase after her to spend time with you?  How does that make sense?  You're jealous of her, and you're jealous of the time your brother spends with her instead of you.", "yes , OPs acting like entitled jealous AH", "Yeah I understood that. The paid leave means she's not working in that job full time at the same time as doing her PhD, she's been given the have to do the PhD I think. \n\nBut she may still be doing some things to keep updated and involved while on paid leave...", "I understood she broke up with him right then and there, giving him no chance to argue. Still, he deserved it.", "Yeah, but is it being a mother? I don't think so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc85\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 /s", "Can you even imagine being in grad school and having your boyfriend's WHOLE FAMILY stage an intervention at your home to complain about wanting you to devote more time to THEM?\n\n>A few days ago, me and my parents went to her house to talk things out with them both. We were upset, but tried our best to explain why her distance and refusal to help was unacceptable since she doesn't work and has free time, i told her i wished she'd be more caring and she got increasingly angrier, but said nothing.\n\nThis just sounds like a nightmare. I would be furious, especially after the \"boyfriend\" said he didn't want to take sides.", "Maybe \u201chelping people abroad\u201d is her doing her job via Zoom?", "And if her govt is financing her, maybe she\u2019s obligated to help some of her people where you are. You don\u2019t know. Also, not everyone has families like yours. So possibly she found you all very invasive & overwhelming. I personally would. So, YTA. And why you think she should babysit your son is beyond me. Maybe she she doesn\u2019t like kids. And why you would leave your kid with a virtual stranger is beyond me. You all are over the top.", "I was confused about the judge thing too. Like is she on leave to get a PhD? Does judge mean something else to OP? Is she both a judge and working toward her PhD part time?\n\nI don\u2019t think op ever bothered to learn exactly what the gf did/does", "Absolutely.", "Also true... This still is his chance. He is now suffering the consequences, so maybe he will learn from it and won't let them bomb his next relationship.", "I don't think OP has any idea what a phd really is and what it takes to obtain it", "Where are you getting this information?", "No matter what the situation, OP is not entitled to her time. OP sounds insufferable.", "From the post it says the ex said \u201cthis is another example\u201d which, to me, sounds like she\u2019s brought it up before.", "She asked if he agreed she should be at the disposal of his family and he said he wasn't taking sides. That's pretty much agreeing with them. If he wouldn't help in her own house, then that means he isn't going to help her maintain boundaries with them anywhere or anytime. She was right to walk away.", "Brilliant.", "Right? The audacity. I wouldn\u2019t even open the door.", "Yeah, the line about \u201chow could she be helping people from miles away\u201d was too ridiculous for words. Does OP think this is 1923 instead of 2023?", "Most likely she's got her JD, was elected or appointed to the position of judge, and is working on a research-based criminal justice PhD to advance her career. It's not that unusual.", ">I don't think OP has any idea what a phd really is\n\nIt does seem a trifle unlikely, indeed.\n\nI did a PhD as a full-time mature student (late 40s).  It was harder than being a CIO prior to that.", "Indeed", "You know the answer to that :)"]}
