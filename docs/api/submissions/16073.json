{"id": 16073, "submission_id": "133y01y", "title": "AITA for ruining my brother's relationship because i wanted his girlfriend to be more involved with our family?", "selftext": "I (28f) always had a great relationship with my brother (38m) and the rest of my family. When my son (now 5) was born, they supported me through a lot, especially since my baby's father abandoned us. \n\nThe problem started when he met his girlfriend (30s)in university. At the start, i was truly happy for him, especially since he'd talk to me about wanting to ask her out ever since he heard of her from her classmates. what i didn't like is that she didn't care much to keep contact with us, even after being together for well over a year. she was always too busy to meet our family.\n\nHe told me she was an amazing cook, was kind, brilliant, etc. and he wanted to marry her and travel with her back to her country once she finished her phd. He'd always talk to us about how lucky he was to be dating her (she's a judge) and how her government was financing her. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \n\nI wanted her to be more involved in our family, but there was always an excuse as to why she couldn't meet us for dinners, etc. She'd be studying, helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?), and on the rare occasions she was free, she was either travelling to see her family, hosting friends or wanted to be alone. I didn't buy that she didn't have any time for us because she doesn't work and was always at home, but she stopped accepting my visits and refused anything to do with my son as well, which slowly distanced my brother. she wouldn't even babysit when my parents were out of town and i needed her to watch him so i could work. personally, i don't think she's as kind as my brother thought. \n\nMy parents were on my side, brother wanted to be \"neutral\", but asked us to not \"stress her out even more\". A few days ago, me and my parents went to her house to talk things out with them both. We were upset, but tried our best to explain why her distance and refusal to help was unacceptable since she doesn't work and has free time, i told her i wished she'd be more caring and she got increasingly angrier, but said nothing. Then she turned to my brother and asked him if he agreed, but he said he didn't want to take sides. She said that this was \"another example of why she felt so resistant to the idea of getting into a relationship\", that \"she couldn't take it anymore and felt better being alone\" and then broke up with him. I was shocked, none of us expected this and my brother immediately tried to backtrack, but she told all of us to leave her house immediately and to not go back. \n\nNow i'm feeling guilty and my brother won't speak to us because i ruined his relationship and she's irreducible. She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family and I'm afraid there's no way to fix this. AITA or did she overreact?\n\nEdit: when i said i wanted her to be more involved and caring i meant i wanted her to care enough to attend at least a few of the parties/dinners/other things we invited her to, because we wanted to get to know her and develop a relationship with her. Especially since she had told my brother she had no plans of returning to/visiting the US once she got the degree, since she felt uncomfortable here. She was a possible future SIL and we'd lose her and our brother if they moved together and she had no relationship with us to ever wanna visit. I didn't want nor expected babysitting unless i had no one else to ask in a emergency like the one i mentioned, then i asked her because i thought that, since she was on a paid leave from work, she could be flexible, but from what i read from all the responses (some who didn't need to be so mean btw), it seems i was wrong to assume that. Also, by \"not wanting anything to do with my son\",  i also meant that she gray rocked me when i tried to speak about him or show photos.", "created_utc": 1682876220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133y01y/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_relationship_because/", "score": 3324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You confronted your adult brother\u2019s adult girlfriend about how you think she should spend her free time,  and because she doesn\u2019t want to babysit your kid or spend time with you.  Why would you even think she\u2019s obligated to do any of these things? Your family sounds pushy and needy and I\u2019m not surprised she ended things.", "YTA. A meddling, jealous asshole.

Your brother's sig ificant other is not a babysitting service.", "Wow YTA x 1000\n\nWhere do you get off demanding a random person babysit your kid because you don't have a back up? and then staging some sort of weird intervention because you think this person you don't have a relationship with isn't doing enough for your family.\n\nI feel bad for your brother as you've pushed away the only sane person in his life but feel glad for the poor GF because she's escaped the toxic insanity of you and your parents.\n\nYou owe your brother a massive apology and you need some sort of therapy to address whatever this mess is", ">but she stopped accepting my visits\n\nINFO: So she did accept some visits?\n\n>she's a judge\n\nShe is working.\n\nAlso, PhDs are incredibly difficult and time extensive. It can be a full time job within itself, with focus needing to be on graduating with the best education possible so as to use the knowledge in her career. This is in addition to the work she may do currently as a judge.\n\n>helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?)\n\nSee: \"She's a judge\"\n\nVideo conferences are completely normal and possible to do. They have been done even more often by professionals since covid. As a judge it is entirely possible she could be giving advice and support to people overseas via a video chat.\n\n>she wouldn't even babysit\n\n**She is valid on that** and it is not unusual.\n\nShe is a busy professional, and her job is her school. She should not be expected to babysit (Also, school is stressful, PARTICULARLY at the PhD level. Time off is valued when it can be received and it would be no wonder if she did not want to lose what little alone time she had to babysitting). Even if she were to have married in, it's not something in-laws should be expected to do. Would it be nice for them to do? Yes if they are able and willing, but it shouldn't be expected.\n\n\\---\n\nWhen it comes to getting to know the family:\n\nCould be a cultural difference thing, could also not be. A significant other should be willing to at least try to get to know the family a little bit and allow family to keep connections.

Regardless, it sounds like she has a lot on, alongside the other reasons (not excuses) she's been busy.\n\nBased on her response it sounds like it was something your brother and his GF have spoken about and she's made it clear that she's a really busy person. \n\nI've been the \"I'm too busy to be in a relationship\" person who has then been talked into a relationship, and then reprimanded for not having enough time for the undisclosed commitments that followed, and it sucks feeling like you're not doing enough when you're doing your best.\n\nSounds like she'd made it clear to your brother that she was too busy to meet the expectations your family were setting for her, and then when you guys essentially told her off for it, he didn't stick up for her, even though he'd asked you \"not to stress her out even more\" (i.e. she's already stressed/upset about this) and you ignored that. Then when she looked to her partner for support, he did nothing. Neutrality = on nobody's side, not on everybody's side. \n\nSounds like she got sick of hearing that she's not making enough of an effort or not caring enough when she's clearly just exhausted.\n\n\n(Edit: correcting punctuation/phrasing)", "YTA:  In what world do you think you get to dictate how your brother's partner have to behave.  If she doesn't want to have a close relationship with you that's up to her and it's up to your brother to decide if it's a deal breaker or not. \n\nYou had no reason to sit her down and try to enforce rules on her.  Seems like you let your jealousy ruin a good relationship", "YTA. And a jealous petty one at that.", "YTA. You barged into her home, had a go at her (for..having her own life? For not being at your beck and call? I have no idea honestly) and your brother blew it by not taking the opportunity to set a boundary and standing up for her.\n\nSaying someone who is doing a PhD 'doesn't work' is so unbelievably disrespectful.", "YTA. Who were any of you to tell her that \u201cher distance and refusal to help was unacceptable\u201d? Utterly ridiculous behaviour, and your brother was spineless for not backing up his partner in the face of such nonsense.", "YTA\n\nA sibiling's significant other is under no obligation to be close with the other's family.\n\nThis woman gave you MANY hints (her unavailability) that she was not interested a the close relationship with the family.\n\nYou pushed and she pushed back and your brother is out in the cold.\n\nYour brother, by \"staying neutral\" gave her the clear message that he wanted her to have a closer relationship with his family than she was comfortable with.\n\nHopefully, he can find someone who will be at your beck and call to babysit and do whatever else you deem necessary to be a contributing family member before marriage.\n\nGood Luck", "Yeaaah YTA\n\nI get wanting a relationship with your siblings partner but you're jealous and pissed she won't babysit.\n\n\nSo\n\n\nYTA", "YTA Why the fuck do you think you are entitled to any of her time? Who the fuck are you? They weren't married. She doesn't owe you a fucking thing. Relationships with people are a choice. You can't force them, and she was obviously correct in her assumption that there was a reason to keep distance from your family. You say you're not clouded by jealousy, but that is obviously untrue.", "\u201c. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \u201c\n\nWTF does the above have to do with you? YTA and you\u2019re jealous AF. You chose to have a baby, grow up and stop expecting others to look after it.", "YTA. You sound really jealous of her lifestyle and opportunities.\n\nYou chose to become a mother at a fairly young age. It's great that you have some family support, but dating your brother doesn't mean someone's signing on to babysit. Your kid is your responsibility. And studying for a graduate degree IS work, whether or not you respect it.\n\nYour brother is right to cut you off. His mistake here was not stepping in to protect his ex from your demands before she got sick of your entitled, condescending attitude. That woman deserves better, so hopefully she'll eventually find a partner who'll have her back.\n\nWhen you say, \"She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family,\" that makes it sound like y'all are still hassling this poor woman? Leave her the hell alone. You've already screwed things up; piling on at this point just makes it more clear that you have no sense of boundaries so she's right to get away from you.", "YTA so to summarise her success stung you a little then how is her not being more involved with you make you dislike her she's allowed to be busy plus she's not obliged to make time for the family she's dating your brother not all of you , you are entitled in asking her to babysit for you , you could hire a babysitter for a couple of hours if your parents cannot babysit the kid", "YTA, you can ASK for help, but you can\u2019t demand it just because she\u2019s dating your brother. And the way you talk about her\u2026 you\u2019re completely ignorant of her having her own life and not come running, just because you assume because she doesn\u2019t have a job she MUST have the time to babysit your child? One year is not anywhere near enough for your family to act this controlling over her. Also, nowhere in your text did you say that you did anything for her, you only demanded things, acted selfishly and wondered, why she wouldn\u2019t want to meet you all. And then you went to her house, because she didn\u2019t act the way you wanted?? Nah gurl, you totally invaded her privacy because you were jealous and wanted her to work more for her life. I\u2019ll say this very blunt but you destroyed your brothers relationship out of pure delusion. If I was you, I\u2019d do everything to apologize to her and tell her, that your brother was in the difficulties situation of having to decide between his family and her, thereby it was all your fault. It\u2019s the least you can do.", "YTA\n\nShe's not obligated to waste her free time on you and she's smart for dumping your spineless loser brother\n\nYou're all obnoxious", "Yta. This is all over the place. She wouldn't meet you but accepted visits? She's not working but getting her PhD? You wanted his relationship to materially benefit you and interfered when it didn't. That was a shit thing to do to your brother.", "Delusion is strong in this sub today! Definitely YTA. She is doing a PhD, so she is clearly doing some work. You are not entitled to her time. What is wrong with you and your parents thinking that you can go and demand things of your adult brother's girlfriend?", "YTA. Stop forcing your opinions on your brother and his SO. Just because *you* would like them to be more involved with your family does not obligate them to want that themselves. And being upset because she didn't watch your kids? She's not your babysitter and it's certainly not her responsibility to be available to babysit whenever you need. That does not make her unkind. You put too much pressure on her/your brother needlessly and essentially sabotaged his relationship.\n\nI hope you learn from this to mind your own business and respect that your brother is an adult and will make his own choices in regards to how much or little he is involved in your family, how a SO impacts that, etc.", "YTA.

When my son (now 5) was born, they supported me through a lot, especially since my baby's father abandoned us. \n\nThe problem started when he met his girlfriend (30s)in university. At the start, i was truly happy for him, especially since he'd talk to me about wanting to ask her out ever since he heard of her from her classmates. what i didn't like is that she didn't care much to keep contact with us, even after being together for well over a year. she was always too busy to meet our family.\n\nHe told me she was an amazing cook, was kind, brilliant, etc. and he wanted to marry her and travel with her back to her country once she finished her phd. He'd always talk to us about how lucky he was to be dating her (she's a judge) and how her government was financing her. I'll admit, knowing a childless woman wasn't working and was paid more money than me, on top of having her rent and other things covered, stung a little, but it had nothing to do with my dislike of her. \n\nI wanted her to be more involved in our family, but there was always an excuse as to why she couldn't meet us for dinners, etc. She'd be studying, helping someone from abroad (which i don't really believe, what could she be doing for anyone being miles away?), and on the rare occasions she was free, she was either travelling to see her family, hosting friends or wanted to be alone. I didn't buy that she didn't have any time for us because she doesn't work and was always at home, but she stopped accepting my visits and refused anything to do with my son as well, which slowly distanced my brother. she wouldn't even babysit when my parents were out of town and i needed her to watch him so i could work. personally, i don't think she's as kind as my brother thought. \n\nMy parents were on my side, brother wanted to be \"neutral\", but asked us to not \"stress her out even more\". A few days ago, me and my parents went to her house to talk things out with them both. We were upset, but tried our best to explain why her distance and refusal to help was unacceptable since she doesn't work and has free time, i told her i wished she'd be more caring and she got increasingly angrier, but said nothing. Then she turned to my brother and asked him if he agreed, but he said he didn't want to take sides. She said that this was \"another example of why she felt so resistant to the idea of getting into a relationship\", that \"she couldn't take it anymore and felt better being alone\" and then broke up with him. I was shocked, none of us expected this and my brother immediately tried to backtrack, but she told all of us to leave her house immediately and to not go back. \n\nNow i'm feeling guilty and my brother won't speak to us because i ruined his relationship and she's irreducible. She isn't bothering to listen to anyone in our family and I'm afraid there's no way to fix this. AITA or did she overreact?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You sounded so tone death about her helping people abroad like people from other countries don\u2019t talk about this all the time( people do send money back to their families and help them and friends with other problems). I\u2019m actually angry for your brothers ex girlfriend and became more angry with you as I kept reading. You sound so entitled and completely unbelievable. She doesn\u2019t owe you or your family an explanation and I feel bad for your brother. You absolutely ruined things.", "YTA...the audacity!", "Yea yta. You sound so entitled.", "YTA. Clearly.\n\nWhy should your brother's girlfriend sacrifice her time to be your personal on call babysitter, just because you chose to have a little one without a reliable partner?   It is of none of your business what she does or does not do for work, and it is in no way up you to dictate  how she spends her time\n\nFrankly, I cannot comprehend your entitlement.

Even if she weren't a phd candidate and a judge, you would still have no right to assume she is responsible for your choices.  \n\nIf they  ever get back together I hope for their sake they move away.

It's like writing a guide book on a topic where you have to come up with not just the answers, but also the questions. And then convince everyone that the questions you asked are the most important ones and that the way you answered them was the best way possible. And also, her government financing her means that she is one of the best and brightest in her field, and they are investing in her to go abroad and pick up skills that she can then take back and use to help her home country. That is her job! \n\nYou may feel like she doesn't put enough effort into getting along with your family, and sure, that's a valid concern. But her \"not helping\" is a completely separate issue. Why should she have to babysit your kid? Where was your brother when this happened, shouldn't he be the one you ask first? Why do you doubt she's helping people abroad, when zoom and email exists? Idk, I'm getting some weird vibes. I don't think you're the reason why she and your brother broke up, that's likely more to do with his reaction to all this. But you and your parents also have no grounds to decide what's \"unacceptable\" about her behavior. None of you should've stuck your nose in in the first place.", "YTA.  And your entire post reveals the reason that she doesn\u2019t want to spend any time with you - you are judgmental, misogynistic, have no idea what doing a PhD entails (it\u2019s is a years-long full time job that literally never stops), jealous, think you are entitled to her time (while also clearly having no idea how much of her time is actually free), think your opinion of her and why she does is relevant in any way, have no sense of boundaries, and just overall an AH. Don\u2019t feel too bad because your brother being spineless and not taking the side of the person in the right (her) is what ultimately caused her to break up with him, but you definitely pushed the issue over the cliff here.  You don\u2019t just need therapy - you need a complete personality overhaul. I am relieved she escaped the clutches of you and everybody else in her family.  I cannot even imagine a grown woman (and judge snd doctoral candidate no less) putting up with any of this bullshit even once, much less over a year.", "YTA.

I think her and your brother were simply incompatible and he was not willing to accept it.

I'll help you out! gimme a call any time!\" or one of those \"swing by anytime\" sorts of families. In fact some of the most successful marraiges come from that. This is what they think they are doing.\n\nHowever, they aren't because the key difference is that they are assuming, ney EXPECTING this woman to be that sort of partner. The others ones don't expect or assume the partner will do things for them. They don't ask, they wait for the offer and are cool if it never comes. They don't randomly call the partner and go \"hey so I need someone to watch my kid for a bit when can I drop them off?\"\n\nWhat they were really looking for was another resource. Because what are they mad about? She didn't offer to watch the kid? She didn't want to be a babysitter for a person she didn't really know? She didn't want to change plans or just straight up abandon them at a moment's notice to spend as much time with them as possible?She didn't prioritize a bunch of people she barely knew?\n\nIn other words; this woman wasn't at their beck and call and because she won't do whatever they ask she \"isn't kind\"\n\nThey're really just mad this woman wouldn't be their errend boy/girl\n\nI'm also going to do some presuming of my own and guess the reason bf didn't take sides is because he knew if he said anything like \"hey she's got other stuff going on and it's not her job to help you\" then he would catch hell for \"being cruel\" \"choosing someone over their family\" \"oh I guess you're not a kind person like I thought?\"", "Ouch.
