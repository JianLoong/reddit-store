And you did not \"get stuck\" paying for things your son needs, that is a fair contribution based on your income. Your son will be negatively impacted if his mother, who he spends 50% of his time with, is struggling to pay off medical debts. It's awful, but that's the way the system works.\n\nA better solution may have been to split the bill for now, with her paying you back over time.
