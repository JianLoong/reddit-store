By forcing your wife to take out a loan for the sake of your son, you have created a situation in which you've made it harder for her to take good care of him further down the line. Any money she must now spend on interest is money she can no longer use for food, rent, school, clothes, and so forth. That is not okay. Worse, it's just stupid. If nothing else, you should at the very least have offered your ex the money as a loan so she wouldn't get stuck with the interest. Better would have been splitting the expense and sitting down afterwards, like mature adults, to re-arrange the arrangement.\n\nAlso, I'm not buying your story that you're the one stuck with the bigger monthly bill. Private schools don't need to be particularly expensive. Manny's can be super expensive. And how are 'extracurricular activities' a 'certain thing'? That's an expense that'd get scaled down whenever a money emergency cropped up. How is a private school a certain thing? Who insisted on private school? Because if you did, that expense is on you by your own choice, and if your wife did, I would have expected that mentioned in your post. And why is there a manny to begin with? You failed to mention 'certain' daily expenses such as food and clothes and such. Who pays for that? Who's actually spending how much time raising your son? Because if you're like plenty men and you essentially dumped your kid on your ex, then it's perfectly normal for her to expect you to at least take the brunt of the expenses.\n\nNo offense, but you left out so much that it reeks of you trying to make yourself look good.", "NTA.

I'm not even sure what exactly the court agreement says, but bio mom asked that we split the cost with her, and we did. No arguments, no debate. Just yes, I will PayPal you the money today. Because a $3k hospital bill is an extraordinary medical expense above and beyond the $30 copays that we are all used to, and stepdaughter is husband's daughter and his responsibility, and because at the end of the day it would be detrimental to the kids' well being in general if either a) this bill put biomom in a really bad financial place (meaning she could not afford to provide them the things they need otherwise) or b) fighting over this money put a strain on my husband and his ex-wife's coparenting relationship which then impacted the kids.

Health/Dental insurances always have extra out of pocket expenses.  It sounds like she earns a decent income and unfortunately for her they had a plan in place (however odd it seems).

Since the child also lives with her, Court takes that into account as the mother providing a roof over his head, which would then cut her other costs like medical expenses for example.
