Sounds like you were sharing good news, but without knowing why your friends didn't want to spread it around, it's hard to say if anyone is being an AH.", "Gentle YTA. You were excited, but always remember to ASK anyone before posting/telling news to others about anything about them.", "YTA:  \nI mean... gently. But they are right. It wasn't your news to share.", "INFO: i mean. i think this depends on \\*why\\* they were kicked out and let back in. Was it something bad (cheating scandal, racism, whatever) and then it was determined they weren't actually part of that issue like originally thought? Was it something like that and then they were let back in because of nepotism or something? Was it just. a paperwork error? The more sensitive the issue, the more likely you are to be the A H, tho even if it was something mundane like a paperwork error you still probably count as tactless, because 'let back into a competitive program' is a big enough deal that you should have checked with them before sharing it", "YTA\n\nAsk people before gossiping about their business", ">but yesterday one of them messaged me asking why I told everyone, and saying it \"wasn't my story to tell\".\n\nlmfao.  \"wasn't my story to tell\".  guy talking like he discovered the cure for cancer, or discovered an ancient aztec ruin or something.\n\nNTA.  this wasn't a big deal.", "YTA - it wasn't your  news to tell.", "YTA - don\u2019t be a gossip.

Shut the f up.", "YTA telling other people, about other people, is gossip. They are right, it is not your story to tell, it is theirs. It isn't about 'keeping it a secret' so you are free to spread it, so it is 'okay'. it isn't your news. Social media has made people lose sight of what is right and wrong in this area. Your friends didn't post it and there is no share icon to click. But you shared it with everyone anyway. Let them tell their good news if they want to. Otherwise, stop gossiping.
