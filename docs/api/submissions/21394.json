Who wants to have to subsidize their adult children for the foreseeable future?", "I\u2019d say pay for the family vacation if family is important to you.  Vacations are a luxury, and so is family time with your adult kids.  Your generation has significantly better earnings than your children\u2018s generation.  If the point of a family vacation is family time, shouldn\u2019t you want your kids to be able to come?  Is it really family time if some of the family gets left behind when you can easily bring them? (Side note, my parents did well financially, and they still pay for my sister and I to join on family vacations because we weren\u2019t as lucky as they were.  I\u2019m turning 40 this year.  My parents believe the point of family vacations is for us to be together, and we\u2019d be very limited on where we could go and for how long if my sister and I were paying our own way.  My husband and my nephew are included in this.)\n\nAs for the apartment, it sounds like you were quite clear about the terms of your support and your daughter had plenty of warning that she needed to learn to live within her means.  So I think greatly scaling back or ending your support for her basic living expenses makes sense.  I\u2019m finding myself wondering where the last year\u2019s salary went with housing costs to pay.\n\nSo NTA for the apartment, but think about what the purpose of a family vacation is for your family.", "So if I understood correctly, your kid has:\n\n* a college degree\n* no debts\n* have been working for a year\n* hasn't paid any bills or utilities during this past year\n\nNow your kid is sad that she can't have a luxury life (yes 5k apartment and Europe vacation is a luxury)\n\nNTA. Your kid is a grown ass adult and should act accordingly.\n\nJust because you have money doesn't entitle her to it.\n\nYou only are an AH because you kept her live in luxury for so long", "NTA. You were very generous and clear about the expectations that came with that generosity. Plus you had multiple conversations about the risk of this exact scenario with their chosen career path. \n\nSlight YTA for agreeing to let them move into a $5k/mo apartment in the first place knowing they weren\u2019t making anywhere near the income to sustain living there once their grace period was up.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re being hella dramatic about not finding another place to live. There are places, just nothing that fits into their preferred lifestyle. Time to learn about getting a roommate and living in the not so nice part of town. It\u2019s a fundamental life experience.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your money and you laid out the boundaries. You are totally within your rights to cut off your kid. But maybe you pay for the family reunion and cut off everything else? You want your kid there\u2026", "This one is kind of tough...I'm going to say NTA, but I have some reservations.\n\nYou did lay out the rules, very clearly by the sound of it. So it's not like they didn't know what was going to happen, and following through would be fair. The part about their degree having to be something you agree with is a touch controlling, but I understand why you'd want it to be something more robust so they could support themselves, and it sounds like you let that slide a bit hence the situation that they find themselves in. It also sounds like you're supporting them HEAVILLY financially at the moment, which is kind of you. \n\nMy only hangup is the lack of compromise/planning on your part. I don't disagree that you should stick to your rules. But is there no plan B for any of your kids who fail to launch straight out of college into fully supporting themselves? Is it possible for your kid to set up a kind of payment plan with you if they need support, or is it possible for him to move back home and save some money? Even fantastic careers don't always start with stellar pay. \n\nTLDR: NTA, but maybe work with your kid to come up with a plan, rather than absolute pure sink-or-swim", "NTA you have been generous and clear on your terms. Choosing your career path is a must, but then with it come also the financial limitation and expectation. \nThat said 5K a month is a LOT for a new graduate in ANY field. \nAs for the family vacation, also fair they should fork it, but then you have to propose something doable for all, again I see it hard for any new graduate in any field to be able to take two week in Europe on their first year of work.", "Adulting is hard. NTA.", "Mixed YTA/NTA. YTA for not teaching this person how to function on their own and for paying for everything for all this time. But NTA for cutting the purse strings now. You must do that and I think it\u2019s the most irresponsible thing wealthy people do to their children, not teach them how to finance their own lives without their parents\u2019 money.", "NTA\n\nYour eldest knew the conditions and failed to prepare.  That's on her, so far you've been extremely generous IMO\n\nINFO:  Your eldest didn't get a degree in what you would deem suitable to support their lifestyle - did you still pay for their education?", "INFO: who picked the apartment?", "ESH\n\nYour child needs to learn budgeting and how to live on the money they make, and you should both have worked towards that years ago. Moving away to be able to live on their own income is a reality most young people face, so this your kids needs to just deal with.\n\nHowever, apparently the vacation is a family thing, big, expensive, and something you expect your children to participate in. At this point your child will have to spend money on living expenses, not vacations, and you know that, so if you want your child to be there, you will have to pay. If you don't want them with you, not paying is a pretty clear signal, at least if you can afford it. Refusing to pay this does not say \"look what you did to yourself, now fix it\" but \"you didn't do what I wanted to, now I will exclude you.\" \n\nIf you do want to be with your child, while they pay their own way, find a cheap place you can afford and spend your vacation there, instead of leaving for Europe.", "You set your child up for failure. By continuing to pay for everything you allowed them to live over their means... why would you do that? At no point was your kid ever going to be able to afford $5000 rent on $65k salary. If you were paying for everything, where is all their money going? \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you get it either. \u201cPick degrees that will support their lifestyle\u201d .... um that\u2019s not how it works. People don\u2019t magically become an engineer if they suck at math.\n\n\u201cThey knew this was coming\u201d... You both knew it & you have a lot more life experience so for that reason..... YTA .... You allowed this train to go off the tracks. Get your kid a financial counselor, set realistic goals & stay out of future financial planning.\n\neta \u2014 I have no clue how you made your money. I\u2019m not judging you on what you can afford. You have the money.... spend it however you choose. $5k rent is ridiculous & laughable in my book but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nWe sacrificed, didn\u2019t take vacations to Europe, clipped coupons, watched for sales, accepted hand me downs to ensure we could provide for our kids education & future. We also taught them financial responsibility because the goal was they wouldn\u2019t have to do what we did to live a comfortable & happy life. If you want your kid to live your lifestyle then keep writing the checks.", "NTA I refuse to believe the cheapest apartment in their area is $5000. That's luxury prices. They can suck it up and live within their means for once.", "Wait this is a what 22/23 year old with a uni degree and a full time job, a car and a years worth of rent you paid for and you think you\u2019re the ah. \nNot even slightly. You made it clear what you wanted or expected from them - they chose their own path and you still provided for them. It\u2019s now time for them to stand on their own feet.  Personally I think you are a more than generous parent. \nIn comparison I had to leave home at 18 as I hadn\u2019t decided on whether I wanted to go uni or not so my parents said I had to go. I got 2 full time jobs, did more A2 levels at night (I\u2019m from the UK) shared a flat with strangers, did my first degree with the OU, paid everything myself ever since. And I\u2019m still super close with my parents - this current attitude of people in their 20s still being kids makes me angry, they are adults old enough to vote, have sex, kids, marry, fight in wars but godforbid mum and dad stop paying for them.  NTA", "Agreed it's mixed, there's a lot to consider here:\n- you have seemingly been very clear about the conditions of the support. However, did you assist them in trying to make them realise what it costs to continue their lifestyle?\n- did you help them with their financial understanding? Cutting the purse strings is fine but if you didn't give them the financial literacy in order to help them with their own finances, then that's kind of on you.\n- I don't agree with you having a say in their career choice. That shouldn't be something that you have control over\n- it sounds like you have definitely been very generous with your finances which is commendable, but also that could have potentially given the child false impressions about how the real world works\n- reminding them that the deadline is coming up isn't really enough for them to prepare or set themselves up for the situation\n- it sounds like you dropped the bomb regarding the holiday without giving the full details of where it could be and you already understood that they had not prepared for the financial situation that they would be in", "Oof one one hand you've done way more than many parents could/would do. On the other you paid 5k per month for an apartment for her? I have no idea what city you live in or what property prices are but surely there could have been a cheaper alternative from the beginning?\n\nIt does seem a little like you resent her chosen degree/career path because it doesn't live up to your expectations, which is shitty, because to get a degree and secure employment is an achievement. You can't be elitist about that, that's unfair. Especially if it's a career path your daughter enjoys and feels fulfilled by. That's a far better outcome than her being miserable and burnt out in a career you see as appropriate because it has better earning potential. Her happiness really does matter. \n\nNow, you are also well within your rights to stop paying for her home. You've done way above and beyond already. No student debt, a year of free rent, that's incredible but if you admit that it would be impossible for her to continue living where she does and follow her career path that makes her happy is there some other arrangements she can make? And, more importantly, why did you pay for a 5k apt knowing she would fail after she had to take over on her own? \nWas you hoping it taught her a lesson after or was you genuinely just trying to provide the best whilst you could? \nBecause one of those makes you a huge arsehole and the other makes you a misguided, but lovely, father. \n\nFor your next child it might be sensible to find them housing that would be within their budget to continue alone after the first year, before having the world come crashing down on them and making it seem like a \"gotcha, I told you your degree and career isn't good enough\" moment. \n\nHave you ran through options with her? \nCould she commute? Could she move home to help save up for a property of her own? Is there smaller properties that would be perfectly appropriate for her to live in with a less hefty price tag? Can she get a roommate(s)?", "NTA - you\u2019ve made your terms on financing your kids clear. \n\nHowever it\u2019s pretty common for a parent to still pay for some or all expenses of a group family vacation, if you are financially able to, and especially if the trip is something the family/parent planned and not the choice trip of the children. A lot of this is because your generation is more well off and financially secure than our generation will likely ever be, due to changes in the economy and how things work. \n\nAs an example, both sets of my husband and I\u2019s parents like to go on family trips together once a year (siblings and grandkids). Because it\u2019s something they want to do and ask us to participate in they pay for the rental home for everyone. One set even pays for most activities / food. If you can afford it, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable or against the terms you have previously outlined for you to pay some of the expenses for your kids for one-off trips like a family reunion. \n\nIt sounds like your kids grew up with a luxurious lifestyle and that you are pushing them to take high-paying careers so that they can continue to participate in this lifestyle with you, but not have it be funded by you. But happiness is important too, and it sounds like your child is really passionate about the work they\u2019ve chosen. \n\nEven if your kids have high paying jobs that does not guarantee they won\u2019t have periods of financial struggle or as much disposable income as you expect they would. So you are also going to have to adjust your expectations of what your kids will be able / willing to pay for as they get older.", "NTA. Having said that,  I think the apartment was a mistake. It was generous of you to pay for it but there should have been a stipulation that the apartment you pay for is one that they can afford after your support ends. When they leased a 5k/month apartment they knew they were taking advantage because they never could have afforded that on a 65k salary.\n\nFor your other kids, I'd recommend changing that so the apartment you pay for is based on *their* salary/budget so that it better fits your original purpose of support while they transition to adulthood and independence.", "NTA - I think adding a couple more stipulations to the money you supported them with may have been wise though. As in, not paying 5000$ plus utilities. On a +- 70,000k a year salary. They have in more ways than one been setup for failure made possible by you enabling them.", "YOUVE BEEN MORE THAN GENEROUS NTA", "NTA. You paid for education and twelve months to get established/figure out another solution, and you gave advance  warning that this was the deal. \n\nI would pay for participation in the family vacation, but that's a personal choice and by no means an obligation.", "NTA, you have no obligation to pay after 18. You have no obligation to pay for their college if you disagree with their degree. Most likely if you haven\u2019t, they would have been more cautious choosing their path. But don\u2019t keep supporting this entitlement, it will hurt them and your other children at the end. The only thing I would reconsider is family vacation - most likely they can\u2019t afford going to europe if they\u2019re just starting out and if it\u2019s within your means, you could pay for hotel and tickets just so family can be together.", "NTA", "You are very strict but NTA. While I belive kids should study what they are passionate about , of couse they need to mature and be responsible for their own expenses. You also made your rules clear and in advance. For the vacation, be realistic, there is almost imposssible they can afford longer vacation in Europe?  Why not having something cheaper or offer 'them' a very fair loan?", "Nta life is hard they made choices you didnt agree tried to warn them now its time to face the music", "NTA - they can find a roommate.", "NTA overall, but did you have discussions with your adult child about the $5,000 per month apartment when the lease was first signed? Did you warn/remind this child that you would not pay the rent after a year? If so, your child should not have been surprised that a move would be necessary. \n\nAs for the vacation, I\u2019d pay it. This is a family vacation, and I don\u2019t know many young people who could afford something like that. Do you want your child there or not?", "NTA she knew up front that her rent would be paid for ONE year. That\u2019s way more than reasonable. It\u2019s time be a grown up!", "Fuck them kids NTA \n\nIn all honestly though coddling and providing for a young adult is a detriment to them and their peers. It is best they learn independence now while you are still here, rather than learn without guidance when you are gone. Doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a bad father, maybe however try to spend more time educating them on how to save and reinvest the money they are making.", "You can adopt me. Only three months\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nHonestly you were clear from the start what your stipulations were. She decided to go against what you have asked so that she can live a life of luxury after she graduates. He had a year a year is coming up and tonight she needs to be a little bit on her own. I do think though that you should meet her somewhere with regards to the vacation\n\nNta", "Honestly a $65k/year salary right out of college is pretty good. NTA for cutting her off on rent ($5k/month is insanity), but YTA for your opinion of her job which actually sounds pretty good and is something she\u2019s passionate about.", "YTA - Congrats on creating a real-life simulation of The Hunger Games for your child. May the odds be ever in their favor!", "You have given your daughter a great start. It's up to her now.\n\nI imagine the younger kids on the couch watching it all go down. This is your first graduate. Stay the course. Bank of Dad will not always be around.\n\n NTA\n\nEdited for dad kudos", "Jesus. these replies. \n\nA lot of people really shouldn't have kids.", "NTA at all. Congrats to you for paying for all your kids college, especially as a single parent. Plus supporting them for a year afterwards. That's impressive. So first off big shout out to you. Next off, they knew the time frame and had plenty of time to save. f your kids want to live in the city, then they should consider getting an apartment together. Or they can move a little further out and commute to work. Or they can buy a small home. It may not have granite counters. But they will have a roof over their heads. They can use it as their first home. Then a few years later, they can buy a nicer home. I'm not sure what they spent all their money on since they had no bills. But I'd suggest having your kids speak to a financial counselor to help manage their money", "ESH\n\nYour adult child sucks for not wanting to pay their own way now that they have a job.  \n\nYou suck for having thoroughly spoiled your kid to such a degree that they didn't learn to be responsible for themselves.  They should have been living in a shared apartment they could have afforded on their own (even while you paid), been paying for their own car insurance, and been paying for their own groceries.  Your support didn't help teach them to be independent and contributed to bad financial habits.", "NTA.  You're a great dad.  Told her the deal, and she took you for granted.", "ESH.  Your arrangement isn\u2019t great. Had you not bankrolled year one would your child have relocated to a job and area that suits their career?

They have to look out for themselves.", "ESH \n\nYou are the AG for three things.\n\n1)  The snotty, nasty, classist attempts to manipulate your kids into fields that pay well above average. 65-85k is far abouve the national average. \n\n2) The desire to \"make an example\" of the oldest so that the other kids fear you. That is massive assholery. You alsp likely will not be as strict with the younger ones. This is you biggest AH move.\n\n\n3) The expectation that ANY recent college be able to afford a 2 weel European vacation a year out of school. Clueless and completely out of touch.\n\nYou kid is the A H for expecting 60k in rent and tantrumming. They need to move outnof the citt or get roommates. And will need to skip all vacations.", "Info: who picked the apartment, and what is her degree/career?\n\nRegardless YTA for expecting them to pay for the vacation as well as all expenses. You also have set them up to fail by doing this all at once, instead of preparing them to take everything over the course of the year. A better choice would have been to pay for financial planning/literacy over a $5000 apartment. (She could have moved somewhere with roommates for her first year out of school, even if-- unbelievably-- there wasn't a lower price apartment available.) Hell,  a cheaper apartment and a savings account you contribute to would have made more sense.\n\nYou say you can afford it, assuming your kids know you can, of course you're being a jerk. You didn't do anything to prepare them for the ACTION of supporting themselves. You've denied them the skills to care for themselves. You could have been putting the money aside while allowing them to figure out how to manage their money and given them a chunk of money when they reach independence, and bailed them out if they fucked up or had a true emergency. \n\nYou can't complain they don't take care of themselves when YOU spoiled them.", "I'm in agreement that limiting financial support was to be expected but no way is the family vacation doable for a recent graduate in this economy. Arranging for your graduate to meet with a career & financial planner would be a great way to launch them. A third party to demonstrate in real numbers, this is what you chose, the expected salary in various areas & the living expenses, how to budget & plan for a future.", "ESH. It is unreasonable for her to pick a career that will not allow her to support herself IF that means she intends on depending on you to bankroll her for the foreseeable future, if not forever. But that doesn\u2019t mean you get to be so damn judgmental and controlling. Let me guess, you wanted her to go into medicine/law/STEM but she ended up doing \u2026 what, graphic design? Photography? Art? Whatever. If she is as passionate about her field as she says she is, then she should be willing to move to another state or wherever she will be able to find work and afford to support herself if that\u2019s what it takes. Missing out on a(n unnecessarily expensive) vacation will be a good wake up call for her to realize that living her dream will mean she can\u2019t have everything. No need for you to cast aspersions.", "YTA. the sink-or-swim thing is really stupid, especially since you have enough money to provide a safety net for your kid. while she did know this was coming, she was still unable to adequately prepare for being independent, and this is where you keep supporting her while teaching her how to be on her own. the reason she contacted everyone is probably because she panicked and thought the others could convince you to help her.", "YTA I think that you should pay for the trip but not the apartment.", "YTA because you set your child up for failure.

It would have been absolutely out of the question, regardless of my planning, because no entry-level job would have been enough to pay for their style of vacation, nor would I have wanted to prioritize the trips they planned.

I have a car loan, rent, student loans, and a little bit of credit card debt and I manage it all. Why did you let them move into a 5k apartment knowing they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it alone? You should have insisted they live in an apartment they could afford solo and/or insist upon them having roommates. \n\nBy no means am I saying you should continue to front the money for their lifestyle because where is all their income going? At some point they have to learn to manage money and bills on their own.

But, if my dad was paying for basically everything for me and that\u2019s $5000/month apt, I sure as hell would have taken the time to learn how to sustain myself and not act spoiled when my dad follows through with his word. OP is NTA at all. Not everyone has rich dads that will pay what OP is paying for his daughter, her fault for not listening lol. She\u2019s an adult, not a 10 year old", "The better option would've been to set realistic living expenses in college.  He shouldn't have paid for a $5k/month apartment and brand new car.\n\nYes, the kid pursued a career that couldn't afford their lifestyle, but Dad is the one that fostered that lifestyle.  And honestly, what jobs out of college can afford that lifestyle.  Lawyers, dentists, doctors, programmers, ect. cant afford $60k per year in rent. There aren't any careers unless Daddy is going to buy them a business.  OP should've never set that expectation by paying for it.", "10 years ago was such a great time to buy...today's market is a joke.", "The kid got a degree OP 'disagreed' with. Instead of renting a reasonably priced apartment and helping kid learn how to live within their means,  OP financed something fancy like what they're used to. Seems like a big \"I told you so\" for the degree choice. 65K isn't bad right out of college, and it is almost what I was making as a teacher when I retired last year.", "I live in a big city area and have an adult son and recently now don't have a roommate because of the high prices for rent. I'm sure the child in question has never had to live in the real world before now though. And who makes enough a year out of college to pay for a $5000 a month apartment???\n\nDad just allowed this child to live the high life after going back on one of his own conditions. He knew that the degree wouldn't pay for the rent let alone anything else so why would said child think that daddy wouldn't cave on this too. This whole situation is a mess.", "I really, really want to know what the kid studied and what city they are in.", ">  lifestyle that includes $5k/mo apartments, you need to pick a career that earns $200k a year\n\nYou need to earn way more than $200k a year to comfortably afford a 5k apartment. A 5k a month apartment for a recent graduate of any career path - that is some sort of high end luxury place in even the highest COL cities. The kid clearly likes the high life, which makes their career choice extra stupid. If you decide to major in basketweaving, you can't be into the gucci lifestyle.", "I was still studying, with no one paying for my degree (i.e. student loan), and paying my own rent + car + bills etc... and managed to save for a trip to Europe with my then girlfriend (now wife).  I don't see it as unachievable - it just takes planning and saving, if she knew about it in advance, I don't think it is unreasonable for OP to have expected her to per her own way.   He isn't doing this out of spite, he obviously cares very much for his children, he just wants them to encourage good behaviours and make them not entirely reliant on him.  As a parent now, I get that.", "Brand new doctors can\u2019t afford $5000 a month rent.", "How much PTO do you think she has???", "It all depends on the money invested in the degree. Many people here pick degrees with poor ROI and take out loans to pay for it. It blows my mind when that happens because now they are stuck forever with loans they can never pay back unless they switch to another industry/work more hrs but even then it will take them decades to fix their finances. It's so irresponsible and so very sad", "Sounds like you\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job of encouraging your child to remain dependent upon you deep into their adult life as well as preventing them from ever experiencing any real-life consequences. And now you are now wondering why this child is so irresponsible and poorly prepared for life. I would say that your the asshole for everything you\u2019ve admitted to doing in this post \ud83d\ude44", "If OP caves to her here, then he\u2019s obligated to do the same for every single of his other kids otherwise he\u2019ll be TA who showed favoritism to his eldest.", "Yeah I can completely understand that. I've seen so many people on the internet absolutely crippled by their student debt in the US. I've seen a lot pick degrees that should bring them a lot of money back and not be able to secure jobs in that field too. It truly is insane to me. Over here most degrees cost the same amount, there's exceptions for private universities and post grad courses, but for the majority of 3/4 year bachelors have a flat rate no matter what the subject. My undergrad for example was Psychology, a useless degree alone as you can't practice without at least a Masters after. Plenty of people take that not knowing how few masters places there actually are and even fewer clinical placement opportunities. I did and went into mental health occupational therapy for my masters. I'd have had to self-fund that if I didn't get a workplace sponsorship (which I thankfully did) and got a great career after. It cost me the same as say a teaching degree or a biochemistry degree. I cannot imagine the pressure of huge amounts of looming debt just to get qualifications or having to choose what to do based on whether you'll be able to make your investment pay off in return. \n\nIt's extremely sad and it must be such a huge worry for not only students but their families too", "Shit, I live in Brooklyn and I pay just under $1600 for my 1 bedroom. Now, I have been in this rent stabilized apartment for 9 years, but still", "Interesting how quickly the THEY became a she.", "Am I seriously delusional or is 65-85k a pretty decent salary for a single person with a bachelor\u2019s? I know they live in a city based on the post and as someone who also lives in a big city 5k is luxury anyway you slice it. The fact that the dad thinks that salary is shameful really shows how rich these people must be.", "Which is why I said that greatly lessening or ending his payment for the apartment was totally reasonable.", "A decade ago I paid $1850 for a 2 bedroom that was the entire top floor of a brownstone in Manhattan. Even in NYC you can find cheaper rent than 5k. \nCurrently my sister pays 2500 for a one bedroom with a private backyard on the UES.", "Mixed YTA / NTA as others said. $5000/month apartment is ridiculous even in NYC or SF. That would be inappropriate on 100k/year without a roommate or partner. Tell them they aren't an heir / heiress and should live like a normal person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know why you're being so unreasonable about a 65-85k job. That's well above median personal income, and if their partner earns similarly, they will be a top earning household. They won't have yachts or summer homes, but it's enough to live a comfortable live and raise kids on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, if you want a fresh college grad to do a 2 week vacation on another continent (I presume since you mentioned it), of course you should pay for them. If they say, \"Well, I can't afford it, so I'll hang out with my friends locally instead,\" you would have zero right to be even mildly disappointed.", "I'm going to say YTA because you failed to prepare your child for this, failing your role as a parent. You footed the bill for a lifestyle that is above the means of most people her age and are now surprised when she struggles to adjust.", "When you end up alone, you'll think about why they cut you forever", "Why pay $5000 a month in rent?  \n\nSeriously, you knew how much this kid would be earning, $60,000 (one year of rent) would have made a nice down payment on something they could afford.", "NTA. I'm very confused as to why you're paying all these expenses for your adult child. I'm also confused as to why you feel an $85k ceiling isn't enough. I live in a very expensive area and get things are costly. You've created spoiled little monsters tba. NTA for putting an end to the money train but you are TA for being so negative of what your kid decided to make their life about. Financial support is great but you should be supporting them in a different way. Be supportive even if you don't agree with their decision. Now, go forward and teach your kid about the value of money as it sure seems you failed at that.", ">That\u2019s what I was thinking. Like $5k a month for an apartment?? The only salary I can think of that would max out at $85k/year in a city where rent averaged that high would maybe be teaching, at which point I kinda feel for the daughter cus teachers are whole heartedly taken advantage of.\n\nTeaching in the higher COL areas can hit six figures. That takes some seniority and sometimes extra duties, but I was on track to hit that at \\~12 years before a career change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome states treat teachers with abject contempt, but that's not all of them.", "Who raised that adult?", "Fair fair...."]}
