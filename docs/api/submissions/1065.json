I met my partner (27F) 4 years ago in the US (I lived there for 20 years but she's from there). We moved to the Netherlands shortly after meeting because I was starting university here and she decided to come with me. We've been engaged for a few months now.\n\nI haven't visited Italy or seen any of my Italian family in almost 14 years and I told her when I met her that I wanted to go now that it was actually afforable (flights to Italy from the US are much more expensive). She seemed cool with me going alone since she didn't have a lot of money due to some visa complications. I decided to wait because I thought it would be nicer to go together. After some time though, I started getting impatient. I decided that I should just go on my own, but then covid happened so obviously I couldn't go anymore.\n\nI got a job in Sweden during covid and we decided to move there together. She absolutely HATES the cold, so her moving to Sweden was difficult for her. We stayed there for 7 months and then moved back to the Netherlands because we both hated it there. When we moved back here, I told her I was tired of waiting to go to Italy and that I was going to go for Christmas this year one way or another. She didn't object.\n\nNow she's an art student and was able to visit Italy a few months ago for a course she was taking. I asked about going with her and she said it would be weird because she was there for studying and she thought that me hanging out there was be awkward. I was cool with that, but then I said I would just stick to going to Italy for Christmas then.\n\nShe's upset that I want to go on holiday without her. I told her we could go together for Christmas but she doesn't have the money for another trip. She has another Italy trip to go on sometime in June, but I HATE the hot weather and would be miserable during that time in Italy so I really don't want to go then. She said I could wait until late 2023 or early 2024 because she has another Italy trip she has to go on for another course she'll be taking, but she doesn't know which month it will be. But I don't want to wait that long since I've already been waiting since 2009 to see my family. She says now that we're committed, I shouldn't go on holiday without her because it's not like when we first met and she's never heard of any other committed couple going on separate holidays.\n\nPart of me understands that she came to Sweden with me when she hates the cold, so I could go to Italy during the summer even though I hate the heat. But I also feel it's unfair to keep me from seeing family and my home country for this long just because she doesn't have the money. She's spent \u20ac3000 on tattoos this year, so I feel like if going on holiday together was that important she could've waited for the tattoos.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667555057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylu6wy/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_vacation_without_my/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There may be other compromises that will work as well, but this is the most obvious one to me.", "NTA - it's normal and healthy for people to take separate holidays. The mindset of doing everything together is odd and unhealthy. It's your family and your life. Get the ticket to Italy... Its not as if you're doing bad... You're going to visit your family.", "ESH\n\nI was swaying towards NTA but then you said you'd leave your fianc\u00e9 alone for Christmas. \n\nI understand that you want to go home and catch up with everyone, but do you not want to show off to them the woman that you're going to marry?! \n\nI can see from your point of view that if you go together you wont have the same experience catching up with friends and family as you possibly wont talk as openly when she's there. \n\nBut to exclude her and leave her alone for christmas is a dick move.", "You're NTA. You shouldn't have to keep waiting to see your family. If she hadn't wasted so much money on tattoos,  she could afford to go with you. That was her choice.", "NTA. With finances one has to set priorities, and live with this. Your priority o\u00eds finally seeing your family after a really long time. Hers where her tattoos. That is perfectly OK. \n\nWhen traveling one has also priorities. When she traveld to Italy her priority was her art, and you would have been in the way. When you want to travel to Italy it is to catch up with your family, and you wanted her to come with you. That is nice. \n\nBut just imagine how your family will feel about her when they finally see her and basically she is 'the partner who didn't let our kid (you are always a kid within family) visit us'. That will be uncomfortable for everyone. \n\nGo see your family, and tell them how nice she is, and than they will welcome her with open arms when she makes it there. \n\nBut it is not OK to tell you", "NTA \n\nGo and see your family, she\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA you're not joint at the hip - you are allowed to visit your family alone when you want. Even married you can do that. Stop wasting time - did you not see how many families got torn apart during covid with their parents or grandparents dying - your parents are not getting any younger. Book it and go.\n\nShe's irrational - even married couples do go on holiday separately - with their friends, to visit family. Also you are allowed alone time with your own family.\n\nIts abusive her not allowing you to see your family for another year or two. Grow up.\n\nAnd no it was not weird of  you to go to Italy with her whilst she was doing a course - thats what partners do - go with them whether its study or work. You are your own person too and you'd be doing your own stuff.", "I suggested this as well but it all comes down to finances unfortunately.", "She did say no to all other alternatives though..", "That's totally fair and also the reason why I decided not to go for Christmas (sorry, forgot to add it to the original post). Now I'm considering going in March or April the latest.", "NTA It's not just going on a holiday alone, it's visiting family for the first time in years.\n\nAnd as far as not going in separate holidays if you're in a committed relationship, that's just BS. Being in a committed relationship does not mean that you have to do every single thing together. My mom gets more vacation days than my dad, so we've been on two additional vacations during my school holidays back then, she usually goes on a weekend long spa trip with friends/coworkers once a year, and she took one or two shorter one week vacations by herself that were kind of a mix of vacation and physical therapy/medical treatments (not because she had to because of a doctor's order but for her well being).", "NTA\n\nShe's playing you bro.", "NTA. You\u2019re the actual Italian but you haven\u2019t been in 14 years to see your family and she\u2019s planning 3 trips without you but is throwing a fit that you want to plan one you gave her plenty of warning and notice about? If I were you, I\u2019d be handling this with some VERY choice words to my fianc\u00e9e to back off if she wants the wedding to happen.", "I\u2019m going to say YTA because you could go together in June. To be honest, on average June in Italy is not that hot (not like July-Aug). I think the weather is not a reason to not go. Suck it up. \nAlso, if going together during holiday is about money, could you help to share the cost? In anyways, I know I would be miserable being home alone on Christmas so I understand your partner\u2019s point.", ">And no it was not weird of you to go to Italy with her whilst she was doing a course - thats what partners do - go with them whether its study or work. You are your own person too and you'd be doing your own stuff.\n\nExactly, it's not like there isn't any free time on a study trip. He would have found things to occupy his time with whenever she did something study-related, and they could have spent her free time together. I also doubt that anyone would have complained about him joining the group for dinner. He would have probably taken off a few day of the trip to go see/visit his family if they are living in another city."]}
