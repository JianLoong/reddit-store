Pig and beef are not part of your home. OK. Not having those is not abuse.\n2. If 16yo me heard hey, bacon is freaking delicious and it smells delicious and you can pay a ton for it in a restaurant or you can pay a lot less and try the forbidden meat at home if your parents let you, well, I'm 16 and I can be a jerk because I'm still figuring me out and I'd play every card in the deck to convince you that bacon has a time and that time is now.\n\nYou're a good parent OP and you're not abusing anyone. As a bonus, pigs of the world say thank you.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house so your rules. Having a restriction on a particular type isn't abuse and saying so seems a bit dramatic. You could consider letting him cook it in his own dishes or something if there is a issue of cross contamination.\n\nWhy is he so obsessed with eating pork? If he really wants to try it so bad he could save up money and go get it at one of those restaurants. If he does this I would suggest bacon or barbeque to make it worth while.", "NTA. It's against your religion, so it's perfectly reasonable not to want your utensils to be used to cook and eat it. You're not forbidding him from eating pork, you just don't want it in your kitchen. He is welcome to get a job so that he can afford to eat it in restaurants instead.", "NAH.  You are allowed to set rules for your home and your 16yo is old enough to be unhappy with them.  Sounds like normal life!", "NTA. \"Your house, your rules\" may be overused on this sub but it completely applies here. If eating pork goes against your religious beliefs then there is no reason why you should have to allow it in your home. He can eat pork if he wants, just not in your house.", "NTA \n\n\nYou aren't stopping him from having it, just from cooking it in your kitchen. He doesn't \"need\" pork, he just prioritizes it because it's forbidden. But you are doing the right thing by not saying \"you must follow my beliefs,\" you just don't want it cooked in your kitchen.", "Well, while your reasons have to do with religion, your answer doesn't (which I respect you for honestly) as you aren't banning him from eating what he wants, just not in your house which is perfectly fine, your house your rules, NTA.", "NTA Like you said you aren\u2019t starving him or telling him he can never eat it, you\u2019re just setting rules in you\u2019re own home.

I have had friends who keep kosher and friends who observe halal, and they were all fine with the fact that I didn\u2019t as long as I didn\u2019t bring my forbidden food into their house.  I know in both of those faiths, it is considered to be polluting the home to have treif or haram (unclean/forbidden) foods enter the home at all.  I assume your faith has a similar prohibition.", "NTA. I'm 19 and living with my parents. Though my father has no issues with eating red meat since he tried those before, my mother has, coz of religious issues.\nTo avoid drama, if I wanna try red meat, I go to restaurants with my friends to try it out. \nI can understand why your son thinks cooking meat at home, can be advantageous, especially from a financial perspective, but here's the deal uncooked meat, especially pork and beef, can lead to some serious diseases. \nSo, if you don't have a family member, who does not know how to cook red meat, or know what it should taste like, it's best to visit a place where they will cook it properly and help you get an idea on how the meat should taste.\nI would say in terms of the \"not-cooking-at-home\" thing, I think you're being reasonable here. If anything, this can be a learning moment for your son, that as adults sometimes we gotta adjust and compromise over issues, instead of throwing a tantrum.", "NTA. Your rules are reasonable, you are not starving him or denying him the option to eat it at all, you just don't want it in your house. He can be mad about it but ultimately should respect this.", "NAH. It wasn't a sudden shock to your teen that this is the norm in your culture. Your rule is absolutely reasonable.

He's going to rebel against something, this is it.  But as much as he needs to rebel, he needs a parent with principles.  So stick to your very sensible rules.

NTA.", "NTA - You're allowed to hold your boundaries and your kid is allowed to disagree. However, *it's part of our culture, deal with it until you get a place of your own* is kind of an insufficient answer. If there are more specific reasons why this part of your religion is worth the strain you're putting on your relationship with your son over this issue, then you should explain those reasons clearly to your son. Let him still disagree. \n\nI know I know \"but it's my house and I'm the parent, they don't need an explanation, my word is enough\" you can hold onto that if you want to, but clearly you're conflicted because youre worried you're hurting your relationship with your child. If the belief has valid reasoning, then explain it to him, still disagree but don't hide behind \"tradition and parental authority\".", "NTA. We don't eat pork; my son (much younger) understands why and that he can choose to eat it elsewhere. You are not restricting food, just saying not in your home.", "NTA - religion aside, it's perfectly reasonable to have rules in your house. There are so many other things to eat and you're ensuring that he doesn't go hungry, so you're good.", "NTA. It's perfectly fine to have certain rules for a household, especially around dietary restrictions. It's also fine to have rules about what you will or will not allow in your home. It's no different from a parent saying that they can't have soda in the house or junk food", "NTA, you set appropriate boundaries. There is a culture set in your home, and it's not something new. You are not forcing your beliefs on him because you are giving him the opportunity to explore when not eating within your home.", "NTA - you\u2019d be within your rights to restrict him from eating it at all until he\u2019s an adult. You\u2019re only limiting where he can prepare and eat it.

Obviously restricting specific foods isn't abuse.\n\nHe can, as you pointed out, eat these things elsewhere. So he can save his money, find friends who eat these meats, or wait.\n\nYou're fine. He's being the normal AH level of a teenager.", "NTA. You have told him the house rules. He is abusing everyone else in the house by doing this- as this is contrary to their faith. OP, stay strong.", "Does your religion say you can\u2019t have pork in your house?", "YTA, yes. Do you even have to ask? Your religion is just that, *your* religion.
