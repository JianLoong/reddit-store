Buddy is choked but lets it go. Fast forward six months, they are both attending a summertime weekend office BBQ, buddy is yakking with the office manager, casually mentions wagon wheel table, gets thousand yard stare.\n\nNext week he is helping his FiL clean up his garage a bit, notes a circular glass tabletop in his rafters. Feeds his FiL a couple of brewskis and finds out he hauled the thing to the dump, but kept the glass. Not saying it was the only reason, but certainly set the tone for their divorce a year later."]}
