If you don't, you can expect this to happen again with something else of yours. You need her to understand that this is a big deal. It's also important to know what the real reason she wanted to get rid of it was and why she didn't communicate that to you.\n\nThis next bit is optional but I'd do it in these circumstances. Tell her that she has a reasonable time limit, like 48 hours, to get it back or you're going to ask her boss for it yourself. If she doesn't return it, contact her boss but don't throw her under the bus. Explain it as an accident but you'd really appreciate the fan back.
