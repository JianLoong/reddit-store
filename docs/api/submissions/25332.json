I didn't want to do a rental with my dad but I wanted to make him feel welcome and not add stress to his situation. \n\nThe issue tonight is he was packing away some arts and craft things my daughter and my partners daughter was playing with and when he asked my partners daughter for a hand to tidy up she replied with \"I'm not your slave\". I intervened straight away and my oldest son also roused on her saying it was rude but my dad got really upset at her and then me after I asked him to stop and that I would handle it with her dad who was on the other end of the house. \n\nHe raised his voice that I don't respect him or the fact he pays half the rent and he is entitled to react to whatever he doesn't agree with because he pays his part of the rent and it was rude. He ended up leaving and slamming doors on his way out.\n\nWhen he came back around an hour later he was still upset at how rude she was and I agreed and told him if it was directed at me I would have given her a look so she knew it wasn't taken well and gone and got her dad and had him intervene. \n\nHe is upset i didn't take his side and I took my partners daughters side who is only 6. I told him I'd react the same next time because kids can be rude and us as adults can control how we react to it and I don't agree how he chose too. \n\nI hope I didn't leave anything out. Let me know if I did but I'd appreciate some feedback because I feel like my dad has over stepped here and I didn't back down in support of my partner and his daughter which has him even more upset.", "created_utc": 1692790978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z1fyi/aita_my_dad_has_blown_up_over_my_partners_daughter/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is, of course, an assumption... But it appears that he is having internal issues here that he has to live with his daughter, throwing in a partner and another kid and he's in overload. This is no way your fault but he really needs to see someone professional, he's been through a lot mentally in recent years. This is not meant to make you feel bad about wanting your own space away from him but he also needs to understand that your arrangement can't be forever.

I wish you had described more of what or how he actually said that's a problem. Is it really that he \"raised his voice\"? Is it that you reacted first and his response was unnecessary and more disruptive?

You did the reasonable thing. He just wanted to see immediate action. And maybe to feel like \u201cthe man of the house\u201d still.

You handled the situation well and could have taught her why it was rude if he wouldn't have blown up the way he did. At 6 years old they do not understand the depth of a statement like that. Even though he pays rent it's not his place to discipline that child. His continued anger about the situation was probably more meant for you for not backing him then her but none the less was uncalled for too. This is meant as no offense but the child is not his grandchild and even if it was the was the way you raise a child and discipline a child is your choice even if he doesn't agree.

He is your father, you feel an obligation to him for raising you, which is why you initially opened your home and why you\u2019ve allowed his extended stay.

What she objected to was how her father reacted, and who ultimately should be disciplining the child and teaching her that she CANNOT talk this way to any adults, no matter their relationship to her.  (Step-grandfather, step-mother, teachers, stranger, you name it.)\n\nThis isn't about OP thinking the child didn't do anything wrong.  This is about OP trying to navigate the early stages of blending a family, and that includes who gets to discipline a step-child.

(In part, sometimes, to avoid usurping the role and authority of the child's bio mother, who may still have partial custody.)  .\n\nIs that ideal?  Depends on the family.  Maybe someday they'll get to a point where OP is fully comfortable and able to initiate discipline.

And it also sounds like OP thought his reaction was out of proportion and inappropriate for a child.  That's OP's call to make, since none of us were there.  Even if we hear the words, we don't know about the tone or the degree of anger or aggression expressed.\n\nFrankly, if OP's father is someone who explodes like that sometimes, it was in HIS best interest, as well, for OP to intervene and take the girl to her father for discipline.  Overly aggressive explosions aren't a great tool for teaching a child to respect an adult.  They're more likely to teach the child to be afraid of the adult.  OP's father may have just ruined his relationship with this kid for a long time, and if OP had allowed that to go on longer, it would have gotten worse.", "The father is not mad at the child an hour later he is mad at his grown ass daughter for doing what she did he was disrespected not only by the child but his daughter as well.He has every right to be angry.", "...of the apartment he pays for half of?", "No, he thinks that him yelling at 6yo was justified reaction, because he asked her to help him clean up the mess she and the other girl made and she responded \"I'm not your slave\".

Probably not but this is screaming to me more of a I\u2019m frustrated I\u2019m done with this BS and I\u2019m done with being ran over and told what I can or cannot do in my own home. if OP feels so strongly so strongly about this she\u2019s more than able to pay to break the lease and find her own home, if she doesn\u2019t want to she needs to learn to respect the other people in the household who are also paying to live there.", "Your Dad behaved poorly in the moment; slamming doors is totally unacceptable.  But I think this is about more than whether you handled the disciplining issue right. It's the living situation overall that is not sustainable; he knows, so he's lashing out.\n\nHe is paying you a LOT of rent (1400/mo!), and you still see the situation as charity to him. Perhaps it is because he strong armed you into renting with him to begin with. But if you resent him for living with you when he is paying such a large sum of money to do so, both of you will be unhappy. I am sure he is also worried about the future.  Do you plan to try to build him an ADU or mother in law on a property you or a partner owns (if you have the upfront money and he can pay 1400 mo for it, this could be ideal)? Or do you see him living on his own? Basically what are your plans for 5 years, 10 years down the road?\n\nAs for right now, it's possible he could live in an income restricted retirement community or affordable senior housing for less than or close to 1400/mo. However, there are typically long waitlists for such places. Don't wait until you're ready to kick him out on the street to look into those options and get him on the list. Whether you plan to have him back living with you again or not, him saving some money each month and learning to be more independent emotionally could be a win win.", "She responded on here earlier say that she sold her home not to accommodate and care for him but because she had her to because her and her ex had debts  they could not pay and they need to sell that home!!", "I don't know; what it really sounds like is that it's messy.\n\nOP's father wasn't supposed to become a permanent resident.  \n\nOP started dating this guy prior to even selling her old house, and beginning this rental agreement.  So OP's father knew from the start that this guy was in her life. (We have no information right now, that I've read, about what exactly was discussed with the father about what arrangements would be in the new rental place.  So it is equally reasonable to conclude that OP's father knew exactly what the arrangements would be.)\n\nOP's boyfriend (partner, whatever you want to call him) has his own house.  She hasn't moved him in permanently, although they do visit and stay over.\n\nOP and her kids COULD go stay over at the boyfriend's house, but OP offers that her dad gets lonely. (I haven't seen an update on whether he has SAID that, or whether that is her interpretation.)\n\nThings I would not be surprised by:\n\nMy bet would be that OP's father HAS expressed that he gets lonely if she and her kids go stay over at her boyfriend's house.  But I'm basing that only on the fact that he sounds emotionally manipulative already (crying and getting upset if she tries to talk to him about things).\n\nWhile OP and her boyfriend seem to be doing well, as far as we can tell, it's clearly too early in the relationship for her to be thinking of moving into his house with him.  (I can't remember reading whether his house is big enough.)  Since she hasn't mentioned that.\n\nOP is super easily guilted by her father and her sense of obligation to him.  That's why he's still there with no signs of getting his act together and moving out on his own, as he originally said he would.  It's hard to imagine him being happy about her plan to move out of this apartment and into boyfriend's house... and father probably could not afford the rent on this large place by himself.  He'd need a smaller apartment for himself. But he appears to be making no move in that direction.\n\nBottom line:\n\nApart from this specific situation, OP and her family need to live separately from her father.  And that is going to be extremely difficult to do, because he doesn't want to do that.\n\nHonestly, if they could afford it, I really think family counseling (for OP and father at minimum) is in order.", "Well, congratulations to you and all the perfectly behaved children you know.\n\nI don't think it's all that surprising that this kid was rude.  Kids pick up things.  This kid has dealt with a disruption in her family (we don't know what kind; whether this was a divorce, or her mother dying), and is trying to adjust to a new blended family situation.    No matter what you say, kids aren't perfect angels, and they will sometimes act out, and sometimes push boundaries to figure out what is going on with the social order.  \n\nOF COURSE you discipline them when they do something like this.  Nobody, including OP, has said that you don't.\n\nBut adults have -- or SHOULD have -- much better control over their emotions and reactions than a 6 year old child does. \"He wouldn't have shouted if the child wasn't rude to him\"????  That's just one step from \"He wouldn't have hit her if she hadn't made him mad\".  He's the adult. It's on HIM to control himself.\n\nIt's an equal bet that from now on, she will simply be afraid of this step-grandparent.  And he may never get to have a real grandfatherly relationship with her, if that's what he (and OP) hoped would develop.  An adult's out of proportion and violent reaction doesn't teach the lessons you think it will. And it will stay with a kid long after they forget why they were being yelled at."]}
