I didn't want to do a rental with my dad but I wanted to make him feel welcome and not add stress to his situation. \n\nThe issue tonight is he was packing away some arts and craft things my daughter and my partners daughter was playing with and when he asked my partners daughter for a hand to tidy up she replied with \"I'm not your slave\". I intervened straight away and my oldest son also roused on her saying it was rude but my dad got really upset at her and then me after I asked him to stop and that I would handle it with her dad who was on the other end of the house. \n\nHe raised his voice that I don't respect him or the fact he pays half the rent and he is entitled to react to whatever he doesn't agree with because he pays his part of the rent and it was rude. He ended up leaving and slamming doors on his way out.\n\nWhen he came back around an hour later he was still upset at how rude she was and I agreed and told him if it was directed at me I would have given her a look so she knew it wasn't taken well and gone and got her dad and had him intervene. \n\nHe is upset i didn't take his side and I took my partners daughters side who is only 6. I told him I'd react the same next time because kids can be rude and us as adults can control how we react to it and I don't agree how he chose too. \n\nI hope I didn't leave anything out. Let me know if I did but I'd appreciate some feedback because I feel like my dad has over stepped here and I didn't back down in support of my partner and his daughter which has him even more upset.", "created_utc": 1692790978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z1fyi/aita_my_dad_has_blown_up_over_my_partners_daughter/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is, of course, an assumption... But it appears that he is having internal issues here that he has to live with his daughter, throwing in a partner and another kid and he's in overload. This is no way your fault but he really needs to see someone professional, he's been through a lot mentally in recent years. This is not meant to make you feel bad about wanting your own space away from him but he also needs to understand that your arrangement can't be forever.

I wish you had described more of what or how he actually said that's a problem. Is it really that he \"raised his voice\"? Is it that you reacted first and his response was unnecessary and more disruptive? Was your concern overstepping your bounds as a stepparent?", "NTA - Your dad sounds like he comes from the era where respect and submission from children is just something he expects. They forget that children, even that young, have their own brains and voices. Was the 6yr old in the right? No. But it\u2019s not on him to discipline or berate the child. You did the reasonable thing. He just wanted to see immediate action. And maybe to feel like \u201cthe man of the house\u201d still.

You handled the situation well and could have taught her why it was rude if he wouldn't have blown up the way he did. At 6 years old they do not understand the depth of a statement like that. Even though he pays rent it's not his place to discipline that child. His continued anger about the situation was probably more meant for you for not backing him then her but none the less was uncalled for too. This is meant as no offense but the child is not his grandchild and even if it was the was the way you raise a child and discipline a child is your choice even if he doesn't agree.

He is your father, you feel an obligation to him for raising you, which is why you initially opened your home and why you\u2019ve allowed his extended stay. But you need to talk about what happens when the lease is up, because it sounds like he\u2019s making himself comfortable without really acknowledging the original agreement or circumstances of your shared cohabitation. I\u2019m not saying you have to kick him out, I\u2019m saying you have to have a plan for what happens because if you don\u2019t and the lease is finished, he may continue to assume indefinite stay. \n\nAlso if you start talking about it now, it gives room for plans to change and for real in depth conversations about what will happen without the ticking time clock of an eviction notice.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe it is time to have your dad move out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
