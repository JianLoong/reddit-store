Say it ain\u2019t so! Based on you two being the only couple excluded from the wedding, I\u2019m wondering what else you\u2019ve been excluded from over the years that you just didn\u2019t hear about because it wasn\u2019t widely publicized like a wedding usually is.\n\nNTA, you have every right to limit your hospitality to people who value your friendship. I\u2019d be wary of the couple who told you about the other chat, because it sounds like they remained in it after finding out the other two couples called you toxic. Why would that type of environment be of interest if they weren\u2019t deriving some satisfaction from it?", "NTA.\n\nHere is how your snub should go down.  You invite the 3 other couples, they had nothing to do with who got invited to the wedding, to a bbq at your house--say 6 PM.  Then you invite the wedding couple over for desert after the bbq, say 9 PM, and you say you only had enough food for 8 people (you, hubby, and 3 couples).  Rinse and repeat. :)", "NTA - I feel like there is more here.... You wouldn't have cut back the whole group (versus just not including them) unless there were things niggling at the back of your head about the rest of them.\r  \n\r  \nIn chat you heard/felt they will miss your house, your backyard, your entertainment area, your smoker meals... But nowhere did I see, \"Hey sexyc3po, I don't want to lose your friendship, why don't we arrange friend get-togethers on the side on our own?\" *from* ***ANY*** *of them*.\n\nSo I am feeling like this was a straw that broke a camels back type situation. Youy already felt unloved and/or used, and this was the topping on the shirt friendship cake. The fact that they ran to make a new group to shit talk you instead of talking WITH you to resolve any hurt, like.. you know... ADULTS... makes me feel they were using you and are pissed they got called out.\n\nYou aren't the toxic ones. And that BFF of yours should have pulled away too, told them to F off, and started making new friends and a new group with you.", "Nta, sounds like they were just using you to only exclude you and you see them so often. They really expected to snub you and then for you to be ok as normal after? It showed that they don't consider you as close friends.", "NTA sounds like you\u2019re just being used anyways. If the other told you about the group, explain to them how you feel and say you\u2019d be glad to have them over", "On the face of it, NTA and this seems perfectly reasonable. \n\nHowever, ***INFO needed*** to make a fair call:\n\nHow long have these fortnightly BBQs been going on? (I notice in a comment on another post you said you are relatively new to Melbourne). Edit: I see the post was edited to say 2 years, so that is answered.\n\nYou said you have a best friend in the group. Was she the one who invited you to join this tradition? And if so, were the other 3 couples doing this for long before you joined in?\n\nDo you ever speak to either of the married couple outside of these bi weekly dinners? Is all communication in this group chat? Have you ever met the bride for a coffee or anything?\n\nHow long have the other 2 couples known the couple getting married, Vs how long have you known them?\n\nHow many guests did they have at their wedding approximately? Like was it a 50 person intimate wedding, or more like 200?", "NTA, that sounds like a rough situation and I think your response sounds perfectly reasonable. I'd personally probably find different friends, but if you want to keep in contact then maybe do something as a group not at someone's house next time? Also note to self to use the word fortnightly more often", "NTA. Going forward, u may want to invite the other three couples individually for dinner.

You have a right to be bothered that you were not included in one couple\u2019s wedding and to draw conclusions from that exclusion. You also have a right to scale back from that friendship as a result. However, you haven\u2019t really explained why your frustration with one couple was extrapolated out to the other two couples. Potentially, you\u2019ve punished these other couples for something beyond their control.

It\u2019s a good question.", "Unless I read the OP wrong each couple hosts every two weeks so with 4 couples OP hosts once every other month.

Budgets are real. If they truly didn\u2019t feel as close to you guys, that\u2019s okay. But they should have explained it to you personally, rather than leaving you wondering why you didn\u2019t make the cut. Ideally, they would have said something along the lines of, \u201cI hope you know we value your friendship, but we are already at our budget limit and can\u2019t afford to include everyone.\u201d \n\nThey didn\u2019t give you that courtesy, so they should accept that as a consequence, you and your husband felt intentionally excluded and your feelings toward them have changed. You are entitled to reevaluate your friendship with this couple.

If you\u2019ve decided not to be as close to the newly married couple, fine, but your cancelling and revealing the reason in group chat just comes off as punishing your OTHER friends for having gone to the wedding. It\u2019s not their fault you weren\u2019t invited, and they aren\u2019t wrong for having attended when they were invited.\n\nSo as it stands, you just sound petty and like you\u2019re trying to passive aggressively get attention/an apology from the whole friend group, which IS a toxic/manipulative behavior. Your being upset now that they\u2019ve started a new chat and are excluding you just shows that you wanted a different result - which was for them to fall all over themselves to reassure you how much you mean to all of them.\n\nIf you wanted to salvage any of these friendships, you should have been honest from the start and not let the resentment build under the excuse of \u201cnot wanting to start drama.\u201d Because drama is exactly what you\u2019ve started now.", "Honestly sorry, YTA. I ended up eloping over things like this. Venues can be strict, and it can make you sick to your stomach. I was not going to be able to invite my whole book club.

Friends are not always invited to weddings. It depends on how big the wedding is. You're not standing your ground.

If I had spent the last 2 years hosting events and sharing meals with them I\u2019d consider them close friends so why don\u2019t they? To me there\u2019s three tiers of relationships; acquaintances, friends, close friends. If they spent the last 2 years meeting and greeting and they don\u2019t consider you close friends then alright, but they should understand how personal hosting dinners are. This is your home not just some local dive bar where they can use you as free hosts. Also the balls to act like the ring leader couple when they don\u2019t even host is astounding.
