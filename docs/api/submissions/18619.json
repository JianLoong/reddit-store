We are pretty shy and also didn't want to cause drama for their big day so didn't feel like wee needed to say anything about it, although we were pretty hurt. We wished them well on their day anyway and just assumed we mustn't be as close as we thought. bridge underwater as my partner said.  \nThis is where we might be the assholes... Well it came to the next time to host which was our place, and my partner and I decided we don't really feel like we are really a part of it anymore so we cancelled. They got upset because ours is usually the best spot to do this as we are the only ones with a house with a backyard and we like to put on a feast over fire or the smoker as well as a decent outdoor entertainment area. Everyone in the group chat asked why we cancelled and we were honest and told them we don't really feel part of the group considering we were the only ones not invited to the wedding.  \nThe wedding couple told us they only had a limited amount of seats for the wedding so could only invite the closest friends on top of family.  \nI let them know that it's fine that they chose who to go to their wedding, but they should also respect who we invite to our house in return.

If none of the others in the group had been invited either, it would make more sense. but it seems like they like your backyard smoker more than your company.\n\nAnd now they have doubled down and become more toxic and exclusive. If there's anyone from the group that's salvageable, only have them over from now on. Otherwise, start fresh. It's hard to make new friends as adults, but if I were your neighbor I'd come to a backyard BBQ with bells on.

ETA you're no longer in high school, leave the drama.", "NTA and those that went to the private chat AFTER you did the adult thing and told them, well ENJOY because you didn't need their approval in ANYTHING.", "NTA It's your right to exclude them, especially since you guys were the only couple in your group left out. Not cool...", "NTA It is hard when you get singled out for exclusion like that. Especially so if no one acknowledges it because then you feel like everyone understood you weren\u2019t in the inner circle except you. I am kind of surprised at your best friend here to be honest. They don\u2019t seem to have your back.  If someone pulled me into a side chat to talk shit about my friend, I wouldn\u2019t be receptive.", "NTA - Buh bye. Y\u2019all don\u2019t need these peeps.", "I feel like this sub is quick to jump to you being TA in these types of scenarios because \"it's their wedding, they decide who they want there and you can't be butthurt about it\" but you see this couple EVERY TWO WEEKS! That's more often than I see some of my closest and dearest friends. And in a small group setting. It's not like 30 of you are getting together every time. You have every right to feel hurt and even insulted by their decision to exclude you from their wedding. And you have every right to no longer invite them to your house. I would love to know what excuses/rationale they came up with in their heads when they decided not to invite a couple they've hung out with every two weeks for two years. Did they really not think it would be awkward hanging out with you after that?\n\nOh, definitely NTA.", "NTA. \n\n>The wedding couple told us they only had a limited amount of seats for the wedding so could only invite the closest friends on top of family.\n\nIf I was in that same positions people that I have semi regular dinners with would be included. If they were new friends or for any reasons I couldn't invite them I would talk to them.\n\n>bridge underwater as my partner said.\n\nI've usually heard this as \"water under the bridge\" but I think your partner is right here.
