ETA you're no longer in high school, leave the drama.", "NTA and those that went to the private chat AFTER you did the adult thing and told them, well ENJOY because you didn't need their approval in ANYTHING.", "NTA It's your right to exclude them, especially since you guys were the only couple in your group left out. Not cool...", "NTA It is hard when you get singled out for exclusion like that. Especially so if no one acknowledges it because then you feel like everyone understood you weren\u2019t in the inner circle except you. I am kind of surprised at your best friend here to be honest. They don\u2019t seem to have your back.  If someone pulled me into a side chat to talk shit about my friend, I wouldn\u2019t be receptive.", "NTA - Buh bye.

That's more often than I see some of my closest and dearest friends. And in a small group setting. It's not like 30 of you are getting together every time. You have every right to feel hurt and even insulted by their decision to exclude you from their wedding. And you have every right to no longer invite them to your house. I would love to know what excuses/rationale they came up with in their heads when they decided not to invite a couple they've hung out with every two weeks for two years.

Here, try some delicious artichoke dip!\"", "It's always a horrible feeling being excluded by people you thought were your friends.\n\nAt least now you don't have to waste any more of your time with them.", "Wait, it\u2019s \u2018toxic\u2019 for you to have your own needs and standards? Say it ain\u2019t so! Based on you two being the only couple excluded from the wedding, I\u2019m wondering what else you\u2019ve been excluded from over the years that you just didn\u2019t hear about because it wasn\u2019t widely publicized like a wedding usually is.\n\nNTA, you have every right to limit your hospitality to people who value your friendship. I\u2019d be wary of the couple who told you about the other chat, because it sounds like they remained in it after finding out the other two couples called you toxic. Why would that type of environment be of interest if they weren\u2019t deriving some satisfaction from it?", "NTA.\n\nHere is how your snub should go down.  You invite the 3 other couples, they had nothing to do with who got invited to the wedding, to a bbq at your house--say 6 PM.  Then you invite the wedding couple over for desert after the bbq, say 9 PM, and you say you only had enough food for 8 people (you, hubby, and 3 couples).  Rinse and repeat. :)", "NTA - I feel like there is more here.... You wouldn't have cut back the whole group (versus just not including them) unless there were things niggling at the back of your head about the rest of them.\r  \n\r  \nIn chat you heard/felt they will miss your house, your backyard, your entertainment area, your smoker meals... But nowhere did I see, \"Hey sexyc3po, I don't want to lose your friendship, why don't we arrange friend get-togethers on the side on our own?\" *from* ***ANY*** *of them*.\n\nSo I am feeling like this was a straw that broke a camels back type situation. Youy already felt unloved and/or used, and this was the topping on the shirt friendship cake. The fact that they ran to make a new group to shit talk you instead of talking WITH you to resolve any hurt, like.. you know... ADULTS... makes me feel they were using you and are pissed they got called out.\n\nYou aren't the toxic ones. And that BFF of yours should have pulled away too, told them to F off, and started making new friends and a new group with you.", "Nta, sounds like they were just using you to only exclude you and you see them so often. They really expected to snub you and then for you to be ok as normal after? It showed that they don't consider you as close friends.", "NTA sounds like you\u2019re just being used anyways. If the other told you about the group, explain to them how you feel and say you\u2019d be glad to have them over", "On the face of it, NTA and this seems perfectly reasonable. \n\nHowever, ***INFO needed*** to make a fair call:\n\nHow long have these fortnightly BBQs been going on? (I notice in a comment on another post you said you are relatively new to Melbourne). Edit: I see the post was edited to say 2 years, so that is answered.\n\nYou said you have a best friend in the group. Was she the one who invited you to join this tradition? And if so, were the other 3 couples doing this for long before you joined in?\n\nDo you ever speak to either of the married couple outside of these bi weekly dinners?\n\nHow long have the other 2 couples known the couple getting married, Vs how long have you known them?\n\nHow many guests did they have at their wedding approximately? Like was it a 50 person intimate wedding, or more like 200?", "NTA, that sounds like a rough situation and I think your response sounds perfectly reasonable. I'd personally probably find different friends, but if you want to keep in contact then maybe do something as a group not at someone's house next time? Also note to self to use the word fortnightly more often", "NTA. Going forward, u may want to invite the other three couples individually for dinner.  That way, u aren\u2019t excluding the couple that didn\u2019t invite u, and u can see where u stand with them.", "Nta - they chose, you chose. You are better off without them.", "NTA", "NTA - they say your home is the best for the group to meet up in - yet don't invite you to their wedding and expect you to carry on as normal? \n\nNot ur real friends", "Soft YTA. You have a right to be bothered that you were not included in one couple\u2019s wedding and to draw conclusions from that exclusion. You also have a right to scale back from that friendship as a result. However, you haven\u2019t really explained why your frustration with one couple was extrapolated out to the other two couples. Potentially, you\u2019ve punished these other couples for something beyond their control. And\u2026it seems like you did this without first having fact conversations with these other couples to express concerns about your friendship and hear their responses. In brief, your actions feel impulsive and perhaps not fully researched.", "NTA\n\n\n\nLimited seats my \ud83c\udf51\n\n\nLamest excuse tbh. If they'd already invited the other two couples and a bunch of family members, idk how they couldn't invite just two more people. As you said yourself, they are entitled to invite whoever they want to their wedding in the same way you can invite whoever you want in your house/life.

OP said it was one of their besties, but I don't think OP mentioned if bestie remained in the gc or not after that.(correct me if I read it wrong)", "And not just that they see them every two weeks, but OP hosts a whole dinner for them every two weeks. To invite the other two couples to the wedding and *not the ones who always host you at their home* is ridiculous if you want to continue to be invited to their home.", "THAT! \ud83d\udcaf", "Also, were the other two couples invited? I cannot really see from the post if they were or weren't.", "Why not? The ex-friends are close enough to spend recurring game nights with them but not close enough to say \"everyone but you is coming to our wedding\"", "How??", "Now that they have created a new group without you, you are welcome to create a new group with the other couples without them", "NTA- had the couple talk to you beforehand and it wasn't a blind sucker punch or something like that, maybe.\nBut who wouldn't be upset?\n\nI was people pleaser.  But at one point i had to stop and prioritize. \n\nAnd it's clear now who was there just because of resources I had and who was there because of friendship.", "My bad, I interpreted the comment to mean that everyone else had joined the chat. It\u2019s a good question.", "Unless I read the OP wrong each couple hosts every two weeks so with 4 couples OP hosts once every other month.  Still doesn't change the fact that the wedding couple was incredibly rude in excluding one couple from the group.  IMHO in that situation you either invite all six people or none (unless one of the people in the group is in the wedding or a relative).", "Each couple takes turns hosting, but OP does it best."]}
