You invite the 3 other couples, they had nothing to do with who got invited to the wedding, to a bbq at your house--say 6 PM.

Youy already felt unloved and/or used, and this was the topping on the shirt friendship cake. The fact that they ran to make a new group to shit talk you instead of talking WITH you to resolve any hurt, like.. you know... ADULTS... makes me feel they were using you and are pissed they got called out.\n\nYou aren't the toxic ones. And that BFF of yours should have pulled away too, told them to F off, and started making new friends and a new group with you.", "Nta, sounds like they were just using you to only exclude you and you see them so often.

(I notice in a comment on another post you said you are relatively new to Melbourne). Edit: I see the post was edited to say 2 years, so that is answered.\n\nYou said you have a best friend in the group. Was she the one who invited you to join this tradition? And if so, were the other 3 couples doing this for long before you joined in?\n\nDo you ever speak to either of the married couple outside of these bi weekly dinners? Is all communication in this group chat? Have you ever met the bride for a coffee or anything?\n\nHow long have the other 2 couples known the couple getting married, Vs how long have you known them?\n\nHow many guests did they have at their wedding approximately?

If you\u2019ve decided not to be as close to the newly married couple, fine, but your cancelling and revealing the reason in group chat just comes off as punishing your OTHER friends for having gone to the wedding. It\u2019s not their fault you weren\u2019t invited, and they aren\u2019t wrong for having attended when they were invited.\n\nSo as it stands, you just sound petty and like you\u2019re trying to passive aggressively get attention/an apology from the whole friend group, which IS a toxic/manipulative behavior.

To me there\u2019s three tiers of relationships; acquaintances, friends, close friends. If they spent the last 2 years meeting and greeting and they don\u2019t consider you close friends then alright, but they should understand how personal hosting dinners are.

I'd be questioning my so called best friends who find it acceptable to start a new group and be in that group knowing you were again excluded.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't make the list. It happens. I couldn't invite all the friends I would have wanted at my wedding.\n\nYou're completely allowed to feel left out and not want to pursue this tradition any longer. But if you did this because I couldn't fit you in my wedding, I wouldn't want to keep being your friend either.\n\nWhat makes them AH is them saying you have a toxic attitude. I'd have said petty, but toxic is really going overboard.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house. If you don\u2019t want to host, then you don\u2019t have to. No explanation needed.", "NTA. You bowed out, which was a very rational move, considering they excluded you. They have a right to start a new group without you. But calling your behaviour Toxic? that is just their way of deflecting blame. Don't give it another thought. And I hope you join up with some new friends.", "NTA. I understand weddings can be difficult regarding relationships with people and budgets. At minimum, they could have talked to you guys before their wedding and explain why they couldn't invite you. Even then, it's weird they invited everyone else in the group except your group except for you two. And for them to then get upset when you didn't invite them to your house? That feels weird. Again, NTA. They sound like they are being toxic and nobody needs that in their life.", "It would have been okay to just invite one of the couples that they were closest to, but by inviting everyone except you, they made it an exclusion. I would start back by inviting the couple I was the closest to, and going from there. If the others want to come, invite them. You could even invite the wedding couple if you were having a large gathering/party.    NTA", "I mean, they said it themselves, they only invited their closest friends on top of family.\nNTA.\nIts your house, you can invite or kick out whoever you like.", "These are people they make time to see regularly every two weeks. It's pretty safe to say someone you see by choice that often is part of your inner circle. Or at least they have the right to kind of assume closeness.", "That they would continue to have their hang out spot like nothing happened. They even said they only invited their \"closest friends\" to add to how tone deaf they are. Most people would be upset by this. The wedding couple definitely would be - I'd bet money on it. \n\nPeople do not care about others' hurt feelings. They think that if they give a half assed apology, it makes up for whatever they've done and you can just continue on like nothing happened.", "So if you\u2019re a part of a group of 4 best friends and the other 3 specifically leave you out of something, doesn\u2019t that tell you it\u2019s actually 3 best friends?\n\nIf they invited none of them that would be different", "That they would continue to have their hang out spot like nothing happened.", "So, uh, you going to share your artichoke dip recipe?", "I really want some of your artichoke dip \ud83d\ude0b", "Or new couples. Make some new friends", "And maybe they are close? Maybe they had a reason for not inviting them?", "Oh I see. Yeah I misread that.", "Can of roasted artichoke hearts, jar of sweet jalapeno peppers from Trader Joe's, cream cheese, cheddar and/or (preferably and) other melty cheeses, chop chop chop moosh moosh moosh, broil in the oven until it's lookin good. Advanced level: add caramelized onions omg", "Okay. Maybe there was a very practical reason and The couple who got married do actually care about this friendship. They had every opportunity to pull OP and their partner aside and explain that to them ahead of the wedding. They made the choice to say nothing.\n\nBy saying nothing they gambled and if they wanted to continue the friendship and have access to the amenities of OP's home they made the wrong choice.", "It goes both ways tho, if they shouldn't be offended by not being invited to the wedding, they should not be offended by the cancelled meetings, it's not like they were the only ones excluded, they just called them off", "The separate group chat also showcases their sense of being the group leader also.", "OP specially cancelled because they felt offended at not being invited and made a point to let the people know that was the reason.", "\u201cDidn\u2019t invite many people\u201d is way different from \u201cwe were the only ones from regular dinner group who were not invited\u201d. When someone shows you your place in their lives you change your own speed to reciprocate.", "Did you have a small group of friends you met regularly every couple of weeks for 2 years and excluded only one of the three couples?", "They were asked - should they have lied?", "I had people that I knew longer and met even more frequently than that that were not invited.", "Of course they're going to ask. OP shouldn't have disinvited them in the first place. Everything after that is petty revenge no matter how you swing it.", "Given how this seems to have hit close to home for you, I\u2019m guessing you received some negative feedback on that.", "You guessed wrong.", "INFO: \"The group chat went silent and I found out from one of my best friends (also in the group) that the couple started a new chat and are excluding us because of our \"toxic attitude\"\"\n\nWhat's your problem with this? You bring that up as an issue, but you said you don't consider yourself a part of this group, so why do you have an issue if this group is conceding that point? You're broadening this to try to cover your exclusion here, but you rather deliberately removed yourself from the group and then seem surprised that they're not putting up a fight.", "YTA. Why did you exclude the other 2 couples? You should have just uninvited the newlyweds if that's how you felt.\n\nI'm also not sure why you didn't just use your mouth and have a conversation with the newlyweds, telling them how you interpreted the situation. It's weird to me that you didn't feel 'excluded' when you found out about the lack of invites, you only felt excluded after their wedding.\n\nIt makes sense that they hurt your feelings. I'm not even thinking you're a jerk for uninviting the offending couple, but your beef is with 2 people, not 6. You took your hurt out on the other 4 people and tried to do it with maximum impact.", "NTA.\n\nIf the wedding was truly so small and they cared, they would have explained the limit in the guestlist a long time ago. Also, if it had been me, either I invited all of the group or none of them. They excluded you on purpose. I think you're right, they like your property and the spread you provide but for whatever reason they don't like you two. You're doing the right thing. But I'd make a new friend group unless folks started apologizing. No way in the world that I'd go to that wedding unless I also disliked the people being excluded. Please think long and hard on that before inviting any of them back to your home.", "How long have you known the couple that got married in comparison to everyone else? I've been the newer friend before and got excluded often from big life events. I try not to take a slight because I get it, history matters. In this case, I want to know more about your guys histories within this group.", "NTA but it sounds like this friends group has run its course. I feel like the couple that got married should have said something to the whole group and not invited any if they weren't going to invite all. They basically said they like the other two couples more, so they kind of brought this on themselves.", "NTA, it sucks that your friendship wasn\u2019t as close as you think it was. They chose to respond poorly to your boundaries. However, it just might not be as deep as you think it is, although this situation is suss as you were the only ones not invited. \n\nWedding invites are a nightmare, and especially if someone is on a tight budget, it can really become splitting hairs. While I would not have done what your friends did, and it is incredibly hurtful to be excluded like that, I imagine the intentions were probably not to insult you or exclude you out of malice. If they had respected your boundaries and left it at something like \u201cI hope we can reconcile this in the future and become closer, and btw you\u2019re invited to our house as we are hosting now!\u201d, I\u2019d have said N A H. It\u2019s their petty response and refusal to see your side that made it NTA for me.", "NTA they are showing you who they are. Find better friends.", "NTA if part of my regular social scene is you feeding me regularly, you are definitely invited to my wedding", "NTA OP; it sounds like since you and your partner are quiet/shy they thought that they could get away with excluding you and you would just let them get away with it rather than confronting them.", "Look I once had a friend take me aside and explain why I was the one not invited of our group, which involved extremely small numbers and that he knew the others years longer. And sure it stung but I also completely understood and still invited them to our wedding since we had enough space ourselves to invite all our friends. It doesn't sound as if your 'friends' had the decency to discuss it wth you beforehand, so alienating you is their fault.", "I feel the other couples have made their choice though. They all stopped responding in the initial group and joined the new group - knowing full well that it's purpose was to exclude OP.\n\nOP is just better moving on at this point.", "came to ask this :)", "I feel like more recipes really need a \u201cchop chop chop moosh moosh moosh\u201d shorthand.", "yum!", "It still sucks, and it's still not very nice, but it's a little less sucky than not inviting them and not saying anything...", "Pinch, dash, smash, gloop, obliterate, drizzle!\nNb. Only applies to cooking not baking, that shit requires technical measurements.", "Calling it petty revenge really shows the maturity level with which you see the world."]}
