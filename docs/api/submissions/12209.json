It's disappointing, to have much less of a treat you intended you enjoy.\n\nHowever, it's clear your gf is interested in having this too. It's an opportunity to enjoy something together.

I don't think the last one is ideal, but still it's doable.\n\nFrankly anything is better than having a tantrum about how much money it costs. There's plenty of ways you could have a discussion with your gf about this and make an arrangement that works for you both.

Loving relationships are only sustained with a healthy degree of generosity, of which you are showing very little. Furthermore, it isn\u2019t clear your arrangement is actually fair as far as a domestic partner goes. 50/50 split is only fair if it\u2019s in proportion to your incomes. If you make more money than she does (sounds like you got a new job that pays more so now you can afford expensive wine) and yet she pays 50% of everything then she is more burdened financially than you are. But I don\u2019t know that for sure so it\u2019s just a mild suggestion that you take a look at that. Mainly, it\u2019s just so sad that you\u2019re in a relationship with someone you don\u2019t care enough for to want to share pleasurable things with her unless she pays. I can\u2019t fathom eating ice cream or sipping wine IN FRONT of my partner, knowing he would enjoy it, but withholding it from him.  That\u2019s messed up.
