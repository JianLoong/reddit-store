She's been in the hospital for about 3 months now. I live about 2 hours away, so I would come visit her on my days off. When I was told she had cancer, I straight away took time off work and am now staying in her house with my brothers. I had no one else to stay with other than my grandparents, but she didn\u2019t want them to know about her being in the hospital, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with them because they would be asking why.\n\nWhile this is all going on, my boyfriend's (20-year-old) parents are currently going through a separation, and it\u2019s pretty messy. We live with his parents, which is 2 hours away from my mother. However, the mum and the sister had to move out of the house temporarily as he threatened the mother, our cat is up there with the dad, and he refuses to feed him. \n\nSo I asked my mum if by any chance I could bring the cat up to her place and temporarily have it here at her place. She completely goes off on me and is very rude. I stayed calm and just said okay. \n\nLater that evening, my brother wanted to go in to see her, and I didn\u2019t want to because I was very upset at the way she spoke to me. But anyway, my boyfriend and I dropped him into the hospital, and we waited in the car. My aunt walked him out as she is always there looking after my mum, she didn\u2019t wave or anything or come down to talk to us. I asked my brother, did mum say anything, and he said that she said my boyfriend is just bringing his shit onto her doorstep. Am I the asshole for not going in to see my dying mother because of the way she talked to me?\n\nBoth my brothers are autistic and my mum was their carer I am now taking care of their needs to the best of my abilities and I get no thank you or any appreciation. Was also told by my brother that my mum wanted to give my brother more of the money off her life insurance not that I care about the money but it\u2019s the thought behind it.\n\nBtw I don\u2019t care that she said no to there cat it\u2019s the way she talked to me over the phone \n\nAlso I only refused to see my mother today not everyday I will be going in tomorrow to see her but I needed time to think today \n\nEdit: my mum only got custody of us when I was 11 and then when I was around 16 she kicked me out so we\u2019ve had an on and off relationship since then.

She's been in the hospital for about 3 months now. I live about 2 hours away, so I would come visit her on my days off. When I was told she had cancer, I straight away took time off work and am now staying in her house with my brothers. I had no one else to stay with other than my grandparents, but she didn\u2019t want them to know about her being in the hospital, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with them because they would be asking why.\n\nWhile this is all going on, my boyfriend's (20-year-old) parents are currently going through a separation, and it\u2019s pretty messy. We live with his parents, which is 2 hours away from my mother. However, the mum and the sister had to move out of the house temporarily as he threatened the mother, our cat is up there with the dad, and he refuses to feed him. \n\nSo I asked my mum if by any chance I could bring the cat up to her place and temporarily have it here at her place. She completely goes off on me and is very rude. I stayed calm and just said okay. \n\nLater that evening, my brother wanted to go in to see her, and I didn\u2019t want to because I was very upset at the way she spoke to me. But anyway, my boyfriend and I dropped him into the hospital, and we waited in the car. My aunt walked him out as she is always there looking after my mum, she didn\u2019t wave or anything or come down to talk to us. I asked my brother, did mum say anything, and he said that she said my boyfriend is just bringing his shit onto her doorstep. Am I the asshole for not going in to see my dying mother because of the way she talked to me?\n\nEdit: both my brothers are autistic and my mum was their cater I am now taking care of their needs to the best of my abilities and I get no thank you or any appreciation. Was also told by my brother that my mum wanted to give my brother more of the money off her life insurance now that I care about the money but it\u2019s the thought behind it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When she's gone, you can look back and think about how \"rude\" she was, and how you made her pay for it.

But a bit of advice from someone who has literally been where you are: forgiveness is not for you mother now, it\u2019s for you. You can be mad for the rest of your life or you can be at peace. My mother was a drug addict. She lost custody of me 3 days before my third birthday and we had sporadic contact until she came to live with my grandfather and I at 16. I left the home shortly after. We came back into contact when I had my first daughter. She entered hospice after fighting for 5 years. I had to come to terms with never getting the answers to the questions I always had growing up. I had to make a decision: stay mad for the rest of my life or choose peace for the rest of hers. I chose peace and I\u2019m so glad that I did. I saw her through hospice and the most humbling part was receiving her urn. An entire life dwindled down to a single small box. She didn\u2019t recognize me at the end, and I still sat there as a dutiful daughter asking god why this was the mother I was chosen for. In the end I forgave her for all of her faults and wished things were different, knowing we never got the chance.\n\nThen I got the call that my estranged father had a stroke and with no wife or power of attorney, it came down to who was suitable and willing to step into that role. That person was me. After fighting and fighting and fighting I finally got him into a nursing home, laws in ever state are different and in this state there are only a few homes that would take felons. I\u2019d call twice a week to make sure he was okay but I was 1700 miles away and couldn\u2019t visit. Then one day his hospice nurse called me and even though my father could only say one word she recognized the signs and his sadness. So she called me. And I spoke to him over the phone. I had to choose to give peace to a man that never chose the same for me. So I told him that I loved him and that I knew he loved me and that I knew he wished things were different because I did too. I buried both my parent when they were in their 50\u2019s before I turned 27 years old. I chose peace not for them, there may never be peace for them if you believe in heaven and hell, which I do, but I chose peace for me. It\u2019s been hard since then. I had my second daughter 8 weeks ago and I wonder what life would have been like had they been, different. I grieve the people they would have been if drugs had not warped their minds. If love had been enough. \n\nI say all this to tell you, grief is complex and perhaps it isn\u2019t the way she spoke to you on the phone but your own pent up feelings regarding the matters at hand.

This mother is selfish for demanding that her daughter deal with it without the support of the grandparents and other family.  Then she refuses to let the girl even have the comfort if her cat?!

I'm sorry she hurt your feelings but if there is ever a time people get a pass for not being great at protecting other peoples emotions, its when they're in the middle of DYING.

I'm in a similar predicament. \n\nShe was an AH in life and honestly after what she put me through, I like the cat more than her. \n\nEveryone assumes they have a great upbringing but not everyone does. \n\nThis coming from the same woman who said she couldn't care for her parents because her home and friends are on X City and she wouldn't move and then when her health went down hill she moved so we could care for her.

I don't think you'll regret just giving her your full forgiveness and accepting that she can't rise to this particular occasion, no matter how much her inability hurts, but you may regret holding on to grudges that may feel more petty once she's gone.\n\nSomething a wonderful therapist told me that continues to bring me some measure of peace: death is messy. It just is. No matter how ready you might be for it, or how mature, it's not something any of us are good at. It's okay that it's messy and it's okay that you're not good at this.\n\nI am so very sorry you're going through this.", "I'm not going to judge you but one thing you might not realize (I worked with cancer patients for years) is they're in so much pain and their brains are literally dying that they are mean as hell at times.  It's bc if the illness, not you.  If she were to die while you were not there, you'd feel guilty.  You don't have much time left with her; try to be patient with her. Try to imagine how angry and scared you would be if you knew you would die soon, and that's nothing you could do about it.  On top of that, you have the guilt of feeling you've failed at things in life you cannot repair.  It's a lot for her to deal with, too.

I\u2019m not saying that you should forgive her or anything, but you do want to avoid feeling any guilt or getting blamed by others in the future over your actions during this very stressful and emotional time. It\u2019s better to regret being too forgiving than to regret being too harsh, even if it\u2019s warranted. \n\nAnd move the cat in, she\u2019s in the hospital, she won\u2019t know and it will make your life easier. This is a whole lot of shit to be dumped on you at such a young age, and this issue has an easy enough solution.\n\nBe kind to yourself. And again, so sorry. Get someone to give you a big hug from this random internet stranger.", "Her mother is literally dying an extremely painful death. People who are in the end stages of cancer aren't exactly known for thinking clearly or logically. It literally messes with their brains, emotions, etc not even counting the excruciating pain. If you're told your mother is dying, who honestly cares about anything else. Refusing to see your dying parent because your feelings got hurt over a cat is the most ridiculous and selfish thing ever. It isn't helping her to sugar coat it now since she still has time to make amends and spend what little time she has left with her mother.

Best advice I can give you, having been in similar shoes, is to try and live this time in a way that you'll be alright with in a few years.\n\nOften cancer patients get incredibly aggressive because of the steroids they put them on, especially where infection is complicating treatment.  You can often do right by staying away for a few hours and letting the hair sit.
