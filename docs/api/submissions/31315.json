She's been in the hospital for about 3 months now. I live about 2 hours away, so I would come visit her on my days off. When I was told she had cancer, I straight away took time off work and am now staying in her house with my brothers. I had no one else to stay with other than my grandparents, but she didn\u2019t want them to know about her being in the hospital, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with them because they would be asking why.\n\nWhile this is all going on, my boyfriend's (20-year-old) parents are currently going through a separation, and it\u2019s pretty messy. We live with his parents, which is 2 hours away from my mother. However, the mum and the sister had to move out of the house temporarily as he threatened the mother, our cat is up there with the dad, and he refuses to feed him. \n\nSo I asked my mum if by any chance I could bring the cat up to her place and temporarily have it here at her place. She completely goes off on me and is very rude. I stayed calm and just said okay. \n\nLater that evening, my brother wanted to go in to see her, and I didn\u2019t want to because I was very upset at the way she spoke to me. But anyway, my boyfriend and I dropped him into the hospital, and we waited in the car. My aunt walked him out as she is always there looking after my mum, she didn\u2019t wave or anything or come down to talk to us. I asked my brother, did mum say anything, and he said that she said my boyfriend is just bringing his shit onto her doorstep. Am I the asshole for not going in to see my dying mother because of the way she talked to me?\n\nBoth my brothers are autistic and my mum was their carer I am now taking care of their needs to the best of my abilities and I get no thank you or any appreciation. Was also told by my brother that my mum wanted to give my brother more of the money off her life insurance not that I care about the money but it\u2019s the thought behind it.\n\nBtw I don\u2019t care that she said no to there cat it\u2019s the way she talked to me over the phone \n\nAlso I only refused to see my mother today not everyday I will be going in tomorrow to see her but I needed time to think today \n\nEdit: my mum only got custody of us when I was 11 and then when I was around 16 she kicked me out so we\u2019ve had an on and off relationship since then.

She's been in the hospital for about 3 months now. I live about 2 hours away, so I would come visit her on my days off. When I was told she had cancer, I straight away took time off work and am now staying in her house with my brothers. I had no one else to stay with other than my grandparents, but she didn\u2019t want them to know about her being in the hospital, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with them because they would be asking why.\n\nWhile this is all going on, my boyfriend's (20-year-old) parents are currently going through a separation, and it\u2019s pretty messy. We live with his parents, which is 2 hours away from my mother. However, the mum and the sister had to move out of the house temporarily as he threatened the mother, our cat is up there with the dad, and he refuses to feed him. \n\nSo I asked my mum if by any chance I could bring the cat up to her place and temporarily have it here at her place. She completely goes off on me and is very rude. I stayed calm and just said okay. \n\nLater that evening, my brother wanted to go in to see her, and I didn\u2019t want to because I was very upset at the way she spoke to me. But anyway, my boyfriend and I dropped him into the hospital, and we waited in the car. My aunt walked him out as she is always there looking after my mum, she didn\u2019t wave or anything or come down to talk to us. I asked my brother, did mum say anything, and he said that she said my boyfriend is just bringing his shit onto her doorstep. Am I the asshole for not going in to see my dying mother because of the way she talked to me?\n\nEdit: both my brothers are autistic and my mum was their cater I am now taking care of their needs to the best of my abilities and I get no thank you or any appreciation. Was also told by my brother that my mum wanted to give my brother more of the money off her life insurance now that I care about the money but it\u2019s the thought behind it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You should not feel bad because this wasn't really about the cat, it was about how she talks to you and treats/have treated you. You should be allowed a break from your mother. Even if she hadn't been snappy with you, sometimes you just need breaks to recuperate.", "We\u2019ve had an on and off relationship she gained custody of us when I was around 11 and then when I was 16 she kicked me out but we eventually gained a relationship again I moved out of my grandparents at 18 and moved in with my boyfriend and his family and have been there ever since", "The only reasonable answer her\u2026", "OP - AITA for making my mother's death about me?\n\nYes, OP, yes you are.

This a solution takes her worries into account but also your responsibility towards your cat. Tbh seeing that she has a reason for denying (though there can be found a reasonable solution), I think you should visit her and maybe discuss this in person. When people have to say goodbye, they tend to fight more because that makes it easier to part. This is scary for all of you and people snap/get angry more easily.
