Since she is not on good terms with the baby fathers side of the family or with him, I tried to help her out watching over my bfs niece. \n\nShe lives in another city, about a 5 hour drive away. Which means, that she would every once in a while drop her daughter of at our place. \nOne day I received a call from her saying that she will drop my bfs niece in a month for 2 weeks. I did know, that she\u2018ll need me to help out again. But her daughter never stayed longer with us than for a week, so I didn\u2018t absolutely expect this especially as she did not even ask me if I was ok with it. I did not say a thing.\n\nThe last times when she brought her daughter, I would set up who would watch her when I was at work. Meaning that I would call my bfs mother, his cousin and my SIL friends to ask when and if they were free to watch the little girl. So did I this time. My SIL wouldn\u2019t, as she was used to me doing this. And I did not say a thing as we were on good terms and I really liked her.\n\nI enjoyed helping her as she is a single mom, but I was a little annoyed that no one asked me if I was ok that my bfs niece will stay for two weeks instead of one. I wen up to my bf and he was like that he is going to take some days off work to help me. \n\n1 week before my SIL should have brought her daughter, she got into a fight with my bf while talking on MY phone. It was about an unnecessary topic and they were shouting at eachother for half an hour. Next to me ofc. I got annoyed and told both of them to let it go as this discussion is unnecessary and that they were waisting their time. With these words I left the room. \n\nShe hung up after me interrupting them. And soon I received a message from her where she told me to shut up and to never interfere ever again when she and her brother were having a fight. She did not write as polite as I did here, she wrote/talked in a manner no one would to their SIL. She also accued my bf of stuff he said in the fight, which he actually never said. \nI answered on what she texted me with a simple \u201eOk\u201c. As she suddenly brought up her daughter and said that we should not watch her and that she is taking with this a burden away from us as we didnt want to help her anyway.\nAgain I answered \u201eok\u201c\nAfter that my bf and I got into a fight, as he blamed me for answering the messages. We didn\u2018t talk for a week as I felt betrayed. I thought about all those times I helped her financially, kept her secrets for myself infront of my bf and other stuff I did for her. And all I got in return was getting disrespected and shouted at.\n\nMy bf of 5 years and I never got into this kind of fight ever and never went silent on eachother for more than 30min. We talked it all out but I told him that I won\u2019t ever again help his sister out nor watch over his niece.

Your SIL\u2019s temper and instability are not on you! And she shouldn\u2019t have randomly sprung a 2 week stay on you in the first place! This sounds like a good time to set some boundaries for the future because eventually this will blow over and she\u2019ll want you to watch her kid again", "NTA  Seize the SILs twatty moment and use it to bow out of being her step and fetch. And if he wants to babysit for two weeks do not help. You are being used and abused by her. Do not help her, this also might belong in r/entitled parents.", "NTA, and now you see why her baby daddy's people don't deal with her either. She seems like the kind to burn bridges . Keep away from her", "NTA. \n\nNot sure why your BF is even mad? What were you supposed to do? \n\nAnd honestly, the way that she has used you is not okay. Pawning her kid off on you for weeks at a time is ridiculous.", "NTA - the fact that this woman finds it reasonable to announce that she's going to drop her kid off with you for two weeks without actually asking you is absolutely mindboggling to me. Even without all of the other things with the fight, I would have said NTA, but above and beyond that she got abusive and petty towards you as well? Nah, stand your ground and don't help her anymore.", "NTA but you have to learn when to speak up and when to let your bf and his sis work it out.  You should have spoken up when she said she was dropping your niece off without asking you.  You should have let them duke it out and stayed out of it when they were arguing.  That's the best approach when it comes to dealing with your spouse's family unless you are directly involved.", "NTA. Unfortunately (for her), your boyfriend's sister just burnt a bridge when she lashed out at you.", "NTA - Thank goodness that SHE cut you off!  That way it doesn't fall on you to do it.  AND, never 'be available' again for her.", "NTA - you are going above and beyond to help this person and she still treats you poorly.", "NTA.  His sister is taking advantage of you at her convenience.  You are very kind to help as much as you have!  It sounds like a one way relationship with her - where you give and she takes, never the other way around.  That's not fair or right.  You had every right to try and diffuse their fight as you saw it going nowhere.  Then she comes after you?  Nope nope nope.  There was no excuse for that.  You did the right thing.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  You are right to cut off help to her.  She is TA.", "Wow, your SIL sounds a bit hair trigger and have a temper. It could explain why the baby father side is not on good terms with her.\n\nShe also seem to be using you and your bf. \n\nHer leaving the baby for a week is also a bad sign. I\u2019m wondering if she is using drugs? The other reason would be her hooking up with someone.\n\nIn any case, be careful on how this effect your own relationship. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there is one thing I've learned is letting the SO, partner, or spouse manage their own family. This means that issues between them are not my business.

I feel so much better since I got this off my chest!", "You\u2019re right, but I did not now how to send boundaries and how to say no as I felt bad for her being alone.. and when they were fighting I just tried to calm both of them down again as it didn\u2019t go nowhere", "Yeah, he needs to get over it. You did nothing wrong here and you\u2019re the one who has been taken advantage of and abused.", "It's a slippery slope but I've learned that it's best to stay out of my spouse's family drama.  There are 8 siblings and there is always some type of disagreement between them. I just let my hubby handle it.  I'll listen and give my input if he ask otherwise I stay neutral. I never insert my opinion even if SIL or BIL comes to me about the drama.  It's a recipe for disaster.", "No offense but you brought all this onto yourself.\n\n1. Not setting boundaries and actually COMMUNICATING what you were comfortable with\n2. Involved yourself in a conversation that had NOTHING to do with you\n\nLearn to butt out.
