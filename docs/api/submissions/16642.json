So much of your post resonates with me about the relationship I had with my sister before she passed away. Through therapy I learned that I was responsible for myself and no one else. You can't force someone to be better or keep bailing them out. In my case, like yours, she was chronically ill but also overspent and expected me, my mom and her husband to bail her out when she went too far. \n\nYou need your space. You've created your own home you enjoy and you've said you don't want to be a carer. You deserve the life you want to have too or you will grow resentful. Your sister sounds like she has short term options so maybe she can explore those and learn how to manage money better/see what resources are available to her in your area.
