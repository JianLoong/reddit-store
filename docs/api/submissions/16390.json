That is absolutely gross behavior. I'm autistic/adhd my youngest son is autistic and my oldest is adhd. I would never ever tell people to not take what either of them say seriously.

And maybe you could send a mass email of your own to make your other family members aware that you had no emergency and Easter was never supposed to be changed from your house to hers. Let them know the next holiday yall celebrate as a family will definitely be held at your house and you will be the only person who informs them if that changes. And so what if your mom goes all fire and brimstone on you. You can cut contact with her or even just ignore/block her calls and texts for a little while. Maybe she'll be able to realize that she hurt you by doing what she did. I'm sure this isn't the first time she's done something like this to you and it won't be the last if you allow her negative behavior to continue. I hope this works out in the best way for you. And I truly hope you can find a better advocate in your personal life! \n\n\nMy family didn't really believe in any diagnosis. Mental health was never talked about. I should've just been able to just act \"normal\" as they called it.  And I was always shushed or told to sit still, stop talking so loud,  quit jumping around, stop being so loud etc. When I was finally taken to a dr as a child and diagnosed (with just my adhd at the time) none of them ever tried to learn more about what that meant about me nor what my symptoms were. They only thought it was just about not being able to sit still, which they contributed to being the reason I was unable to focus. And even after informing my mother that i was also autistic she again didn't seem like it was important for her to learn about it. I then went on to have my youngest son who was diagnosed a few years after he was born. Thats when she decided she was ready to learn about autism. Even now she still expects me to mask even tho she knows what it is and how it makes me feel. She's perfectly fine with my son but when it comes to me she's very inconsiderate. It doesn't feel like she advocates for me now. Nor has she ever before. So I've distanced myself from her. She's the type to make things up and get mad at me over small things that don't matter and I just can't deal with it. I can't stand feeling like the person who was supposed to stand up for me never did and still doesn't.\n\nSorry for the long reply, I got a little carried away.

If its not specifically a special occasion or holiday like Easter, it shouldnt matter as much to your mom although If I were you Id definitely hold off til the last minute if you decided to invite her to tell her about it so she couldnt do anything to sabotage it again. \n\nCongrats on your sobriety as well that shits not easy!!  \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c"]}
