{"id": 29798, "submission_id": "17hu3ua", "title": "AITA for leaving my niece's bridal shower early?", "selftext": "One of my (50ish F) nieces (30ish F) is getting married soon. The bridal shower was last weekend, and I attended very briefly. It was thrown by one of her college friends, call her Marissa. It was not like any shower I'd ever attended before. Upon arrival, the niece, we'll call her Kelly, was sitting at this weird toilet paper draped throne-like thing. Kelly was decked out in a white dress and tiara. Marissa and her mother Annie, my sister-in-law, basically grabbed gifts from people right as they arrived and delivered them to Kelly on her toilet paper throne to open them immediately - as in before everybody even arrived, was offered a seat, or anything.\n\nIt felt like we were paying some kind of royal entry tribute to a monarch. The vibe was not what I've ever gotten from a shower before. Kelly immediately opened my gift, which was an ice cream maker that was on her registry. She said a very curt thanks and tossed it to the side with an eye roll. I literally heard her comment to Marissa and Annie about how cheap I'd been as I got shoved off to the side for the next arrival/gift. \n\nMarissa cornered me a bit after that and demanded to know why I'd bought something off the friend registry instead of the family one. I had zero idea what she was talking about. Is this a thing? Nobody told me. The invite listed two stores with registries and the bullseye one was convenient. Nothing said one was for family and one was for friends. After indicting my confusion, Marissa said I should have known which was for family and demanded I get a gift card to \"make up the difference\" before I embarrassed myself.\n\nAt this point my social anxiety went through the roof. I wanted to fall through the floor. It was everything I could do to not burst into tears right there, and I excused myself right out the back door, to my car, and home so as to not make a scene. I didn't say my respects or go out the front because by then it was crowded with arrivals waiting to have their gift delivered to Kelly on her throne. I also just had no idea what to say.\n\nBefore I even got home, Annie was blowing up my phone for leaving and for having gotten such a tacky gift that wasn't worthy of family. She's pretty close to alone in being pissed about the gift, but multiple other friends and family have said I should have stuck it out and stayed.\n\nI never even looked at the second registry until after getting home, but did discover everything on that one was quite a lot more expensive and way out of my budget. Since when is a shower gift supposed to be significantly bigger than an ice cream maker anyway? She wanted an ice cream maker, although you'd never know it from how Kelly chucked it to the side upon opening it.\n\nI can't see how I'm the asshole for getting her an ice cream maker that she wanted that's in my budget no matter what nonsense they want to say about what family deserves, but am I for getting super awkward and just leaving without saying respects or anything?

The mental picture I got. \n\nKelly emerging from a huge toilet roll wearing layers and layers of tulle and taffeta with her vacant eyes and claw like hands shredding wrapping paper while her harpy like minions stand below ushering unsuspecting party goers, as through a cattle shoot, to cower at her feet awaiting her pronouncements on the worthiness of the gifts presented.

Your gift was very kind. \n\nWhat were you supposed to do -- stay and cause a visible scene when your emotions began to leak out? Sheesh. Your sister and her bratty daughter need to re-evaluate their priorities. What is up with the two lists? Your generosity should not be predicated on what others think you should spend. That's ludicrous.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not uncommon to have registries at more than one store, but the entire point is to ensure there are items at every price point. If someone's feeling especially generous, or a few people want to all pitch in on a big gift, they have options. If someone's on a tighter budget or they're a family unit and everyone wants to have their name attached to an individual gift, they have options. You gift what you can reasonably afford, and you should feel confident knowing that if an item is on their registry, it's something they actively want, so they'll be happy with their gift. \n\nPerhaps the Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior should find its way to her door.", "NTA.. honestly I can't think whom you would've paid respects to... nobody connected with that debacle is even on nodding terms with respect or Manners.", "NTA! What absolutely appalling behaviour by everybody involved except you. I mean, this sub is full of bad behaviour, but this is really breathtaking.\n\nI think I'd be taking a break from Annie and Kelly for a while and letting them know I think their behaviour breaches all rules of manners and good sense.\n\n(I'm a bit curious to know what your brother's opinion would be of them being so wildly disrespectful to his sister?) EDITED TO ADD: you've said your brother has already divorced horrible Annie, so, seems like a man of sense. \n\nAlso edited to add: I'm sorry you felt your social anxiety was somehow to blame or a bad thing.

Heaven only knows what gruesomeness M, A and K would think was appropriate 'entertainment', post-gift-giving!", "NTA, best gift I received at my bridal shower was from my FIL\u2019s sister she couldn\u2019t afford a present so she wrote down some of her favorite family recipes as a \u201cwelcome to the family\u201d. It meant so much to me!", "NTA. Your niece, her mother and her friend were insufferably rude and horrible hosts to you and leaving immediately and without a word was the kindest thing you could have done, and much kinder than what they all deserved. Tell you sister you're sorry that she was so greedy, ungrateful and tactless and that you don't owe her or her daughter anything at all. You left because you had been terribly insulted and treated like trash. If that's how your niece is starting her marriage, I give it 18 months. If you attend the wedding, give them well wishes and a card saying you've made a donation on their behalf to a charity. The Human Fund, maybe?", "NTA\n\nYou bought something off one of her registries that you could afford, and they treated EVERYONE like walking bank account servants instead of guests. And I thought my cousin and his wife were bad for not writing thank you notes--this niece and her mother are major pieces of work.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Their unmitigated greed and gall and complete lack of gratitude was the problem.\n\nIt's time to withdraw from any more parties, and even the wedding itself. This is a gift grab, and she's acting rude and entitled.", "NTA. I literally got a cookbook as one of my wedding gifts. The only gift from that person. I certainly didn\u2019t have it on my registry but I appreciated it all the same!", "Okay, next berating text, write:\n\nI checked the invite again. I thought the cheaper gifts were for the shower and the more expensive ones for the wedding. They were not labeled!! \n\nThen, don't  go to the wedding. It will be a repeat performance of the wedding party, ridiculing your 1st gift. You did fine by the way. They are the ones not living up to social standards. \n\nYou didn't deserve it the first time, don't give them a chance to do it again.", "NTA. Also skip the wedding", "You should save your money and splurge on yourself. They don't deserve your gift, no matter how expensive it may be.", "Nta. This is so so ridiculous \nI wouldn't have a bridal shower because I'd feel so awkward. It's supposed to be about marrying your love not gifts. \nI keep getting asked what gifts we want for our wedding and I say not to becouse them coming is gift enough. \nThey acted like spoilt selfish material girls.", "NTA just because you're family doesn't mean you have to give a bigger gift", "NTA. This was a horrifying display of greedy entitlement.\n\nThe bridal shower was always supposed to be smaller houseware, etc to make up for anything missing from the bride's hope chest. Bigger presents were always reserved for the actual wedding.\n\nAs most brides these day are much older and have set up their own households, they really don't need such items.\n\nI am sorry they were so mean and rude. You did nothing wrong.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went thru that & your niece & her friends are horrible. I think you gift was awesome. I like ice cream.", "NTA.

How wack.", "Ditto to that", "If it makes you feel any better, my brother has already divorced her.", "Yes,  I would definitely take the gift with me when I left.  And I would not be going to the wedding.  It is quite evident both the bride and her friend were never taught manners.", "I\u2019d apologize profusely and offer to take the gift and return it promising to get a more appropriate gift. Then return it and block all contact from her.", "I would have grabbed the ice cream maker before leaving. There would never be another gift for her- ever.\nI remember at my baby shower. One of my friends gave me a box of thank you cards.  I gave her the same thanks as all of the other friends. I oooed about how pretty they were ( true). When I took one out, i found a $50 g.c to bullseye store ( back when $50 was a nice amount.", "Yeah, cause she's a turd!", "Agreed. Do not go to the wedding, more abuse would only follow.  OP, I think you were viewed as a cash machine, not a valued family member. The bride rolled her eyes, tossed your gift, and made a scathing comment to her mother and her bridesmaid. It was audible. She didn't even bother to hide her scorn. This is the behaviour of a disassitfied customer, not a loving niece.", "At this point, I'd rather give my cat a bath. Still more relaxing and better company.", "It didn't even occur to me as an option. I wanted out of there fast.", "Thank you. Apparently I was supposed to know that department store is for family and older folks and big box store is for younger folks. Never heard that before in my life. Just went to the one that was near my house and got something I thought was nice. Still baffled by the whole situation.", "We all can see why", "LFG", "Would you have taken the gift with you, though? We all know what we'd like to say/do in hindsight, but it's completely different when you're put on the spot. OP said she was anxious and close to tears. Getting out of there was the absolute best thing to do. Putting herself in the line of fire by trying to remove the gift would not have helped her in that moment. \nOP, I do agree about not attending the wedding. Send a thanks but no thanks, and then block their numbers. \nI'd explain the situation to your brother so he understands why you can't attend his daughters wedding. \nDefinitely NTA.", "I love the way you think!", "What a thoughtful gift! As well as needed :)", "That seriously made me laugh out loud! And I choked, it was so funny.\n\nFor the sum saved on buying a gift and outfit, there must be a spa or museum exhibit, or something special you have been eyeballing. Splurge the funds on a great day for you. I was on my own for my b'day, had poke bowl for lunch, bought a plant and fancy planter (they threw in handmade truffles they had made for Halloween, too!), and took the dogs for an adventure walk at a local farm where they can be offlead goobers.", "Yeah, I know. Hope you are better now, OP. \n\nSo sorry that your niece and ex SIL are such AH", "Yep...would have grabbed it and ran!", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. Holy crap. The sheer audacity of your niece and her friends is disgusting. Where's the appreciation? She's not entitled to a gift over X in value just because you're family. That's a distorted viewpoint. Typically, multiple registries just means more options and for your guests to find something within budget. If I attended a bridal shower of someone like that, I wouldn't go to the wedding. \n\nAlso, that shower setup / entry tithe is horrible. Miss Manners would have a coronary. Her mother and friends thought that was a good idea??", "NTA. Being rude seems to be the latest thing.  A friend gave her Granddaughter nearly $10,000.00 to pay for the wedding.  The day of the wedding the bride and groom were over two hours late to the venue.  No word from anyone with an explanation.  Sad thing was the venue was a hay field.  In the spring, complete with bugs and quite a hike from the parking area.  Everyone including Grandparents and Great Grandparents had to stand for those two hours because there were no chairs.  There were tables and chairs in a barn where the reception was to be held.  One of the Grandfather's that had heart surgery recently went there to sit and the grooms family told him he could not sit down.  \n\nAfter the wedding the wedding party took off to do photos.  It was now allowed to enter the barn.  So they waited and waited.  The wedding had been scheduled for 10:00 am with the meal at noon followed by the reception.  By 2:00 guests started to leave so they could go eat lunch.  This new couple knew there were family members with health conditions that needed meals on a regular schedule.", "It sounds like both Kelly and her bridesmaid have bought into the terrible current idea that a bride is Queen for the Day, or the Month, or the Year, and gets to make demands unreasonable demands on everyone she knows.But the truth is, per every etiquette expert who ever lived: That nobody is EVER obligated to buy a wedding present!\n\n  \nSeriously, the official rule of etiquette is that nobody is obligated to buy the bridal couple a damn thing, and that if they do so then it is a gift given out of love and not obligation, and the giver should be thanked with the same graciousness as you use when thank your great-grandma at Christmas when she gives you a dollar bill.  So I'd take the ice cream maker back, and send a copy of Miss Manners on Weddings in its place, with the bits about zero gift obligations pre-bookmarked and highlighted. \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Manners-Guide-Surprisingly-Dignified-Wedding/dp/0393069141/ref=asc\\_df\\_0393069141/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366281267031&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14187085279230659739&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032430&hvtargid=pla-793751194058&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76223197437&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366281267031&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14187085279230659739&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032430&hvtargid=pla-793751194058](https://www.amazon.com/Manners-Guide-Surprisingly-Dignified-Wedding/dp/0393069141/ref=asc_df_0393069141/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366281267031&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14187085279230659739&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032430&hvtargid=pla-793751194058&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=76223197437&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366281267031&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14187085279230659739&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032430&hvtargid=pla-793751194058)", "Umm - NTA.\nAt first, I was down for a shower where the gift opening gets done and out of the way quickly.

They aren't even being done anymore. No one in our age group is doing them, those 2 were in their post college age like right after 2009. What an f'ing embarrassment your niece is.

I didn't think \"third-hand embarrassment\" was even a thing. \n\nShow that monster-to-be this post, the feedback, and mine specifically.

It is commonly considered rude to be seen to be asking for a present. If people really have no idea what to buy they might ask the bride's mother for suggestions. I know a lot of couples do have lists but I can't imagine anyone phoning a guest to say their gift wasn't good enough. They wouldn't like the response they'd get, it begins with F and ends with OFF.
