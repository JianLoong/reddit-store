The car is in bad condition and it\u2019s technically my fianc\u00e9s car but I\u2019m on the insurance and have my own insurance that covers his car additionally. So everything is all good there luckily.\n\nI called my fianc\u00e9 and When I called him, he seemed a bit annoyed and made a joke that did you get into another car acciden.\n\nThree weeks ago I was in a car accident while driving in the snow where someone rear ended me from behind. I was driving at slow speeds. I was being careful. The car behind me was going fast and rear ended me. I was not at fault.\n\nSo it kind of made me a little bit upset\n\nThen I heard him say can\u2019t deal with this right now. Gotta go. I didn\u2019t hear the first part but I guess he was talking to his friends. He was playing video games with. I thought he was talking to me and I said dude seriously. He got annoyed and said I wasn\u2019t talking to you. I said OK I didn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s like instead of assuming why don\u2019t you just realize that I\u2019m doing some thing.\n\nI started explaining what happened He sounded annoyed, but was helpful.\n\nAnd then I hear a bunch of clicking and beeping in the background and I hear them keep muttering things, and I asked him to be honest I got kind of annoyed and I was like are you seriously fucking playing video games right now while I\u2019m talking with you?\n\nAnd he got really annoyed and said it\u2019s live game I can\u2019t just fucking ended. I\u2019m streaming right now to followers. I have people that depend on me.\n\nI got really annoyed and I said well if that\u2019s really more fucking important why don\u2019t you go do that and I hung up on him.\n\nThan I texted him don\u2019t bother pretending like you care your just embarrassing yourself.\n\nAnd he texted me below\n\n\u201cI'm sick and tired of you setting your self up for failure then when you need help you have to have everything your way. I have no communication from you and you set me up to fail before I can ever try with you then you go off on me for not caring. So go fuck your self. I'm sick and tired of your behavior.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to do everything my way I just didn\u2019t know what to fucking do and I don\u2019t know how the hell getting into a car accident that wasn\u2019t my fault is somehow my fault. I don\u2019t know how he expected me to communicate that I was getting into a car accident. And he\u2019s sick and tired of me getting angry at him for playing video games. Which to be honest, I do a lot cause he makes the excuse video games can\u2019t be paused.

I\u2019m also gonna add, my ex is also a serious gamer and the gaming was never a problem in our relationship.

He just was on a game and it annoyed you. No?\n\nYou wanted more attention, he wanted to give attention to the game streaming, and you clashed heads. You both need to decide what is needed in a relationship. If you are super needy and clingy, which maybe maybe not, then acknowledge it to yourself and maybe he isn\u2019t the one.

It seems like you were irritated that he didn\u2019t immediately get off the game when you called. He didn\u2019t know you would be calling right then. Sounds like he tried to disconnect with his friends and then got irritated when you called him out. \n\nIt seems like you both are unwilling to hear the other one out. \n\nIf you two aren\u2019t willing to talk this out after your emotions are cooled, you may need to rethink this relationship.", "ESH but mostly him. Hear me out on this. \n\nYour fiancee is an obvious jerk who does not have his priorities straight. Sorry about your car accidents.\n\nBut tbh, while he SHOULD have canceled his stream(?)/online game then because your car accident was more important, in any other scenario that isn\u2019t an emergency, not being able to pause an online game IS a valid excuse, because you can\u2019t, especially in today\u2019s world where disconnecting online can result in your account getting penalties. I\u2019m going to guess your previous arguments about it may have explained his frustration. You seem to have the expectation that as soon as you call him, he drops everything, which is not very realistic in MOST scenarios. It was this time, but it seems that you have gotten angry about it in times when it was not.", "ESH", "You would think that in a car accident vs video games scenario the car accident would win every time, but somehow, I have to vote ESH. \n\nI think this is a case of crying wolf. If you nag him regularly during his obviously-not-interruptible-activity then eventually he will stop responding all together. Even when it actually matters. \n\nAnd while I understand the car accidents weren\u2019t your fault, and I\u2019m sure they were scary, you should be able to call a tow truck and get insurance info without him. If the car took serious damage, you should call the police to file a report. I\u2019m not sure what your fianc\u00e9 could do to help with that? Bringing extra people to the accident site only makes it worse. I think you just need more confidence in yourself to handle these types of situations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That he is so unimportant to your life that you can regularly go days without speaking to him even though you live in the same house?", "So I\u2019ve been married almost 10 years. At the beginning of my marriage, my husband played a very popular MMORPG. I loved that he had a hobby he enjoyed and I would read/craft/play my own video games when he played. But then I noticed he played all of the time. Got home on his lunch hour? He played. Got home after work? Played until I went to bed around 9/10. He wouldn\u2019t come to bed until 12/1 in the morning and then be gone by 6:30 for work again. Rinse and repeat every workday. Weekends and after work time became gaming time. I didn\u2019t mind it too terribly at first but after our first child was born, I started growing super resentful. I took care of everything. All chores. All baby tasks. All cooking. All appointments for any reason (medical, eye, dental, car, anything) for all of us. I finally broke down sobbing one day and told him I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I was tired of being a single mother and never ever getting a break from anything, because I could absolutely ask him to help me with XYZ, but the excuse was always \u201ccan\u2019t right now, will do it later\u201d, and honestly it got to the point of it was just easier for me to do it than wait for him to be done and actually remember to do it. So I broke down. I was so bitter and resentful and honestly enraged that that f***ing game took so much of my husbands focus and time when myself and our son got none of it. He was utterly shocked. Gave it up that very day. Cancelled subscriptions and everything and apologized over and over again because he had had no idea I was drowning. You are NTA, OP, for wanting to feel like a priority to your fianc\u00e9. But he needs to make the decision about whether or not he is going to make you a priority. Sometimes it\u2019s ok that something else takes priority over you (after all life and emergencies do happen), but a video game should not take priority over you 99% of the time to the point you feel like you don\u2019t see or engage with him for days on end and he doesn\u2019t contribute to combined household tasks.", "I agree with others, do not marry him, you deserve so much better.\nMy husband loves his games but if it was an emergency he would forfeit his game to make sure I am ok\u2026\nNothing you are asking him seems over the top but he clearly doesn\u2019t respect you if you have to ask him to pick up his clothes every day.\nI don\u2019t think you are being stupid. I think you are with someone incredibly selfish.\n\nAlso, not interacting with your partner is not healthy, I live and work with my husband, I am never sick of talking to him (but don\u2019t worry, we do take time for ourselves as it\u2019s mutually beneficial)."]}
