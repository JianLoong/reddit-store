She\u2019s obsessed with my father going with another woman. She\u2019s always been like this, obsessing over things and convincing herself with anything she might find.

Yes, she searched my trash.\n\nAnd lately, she gets up at night to search his computer, reads his messages, and leave her old phone on random places to register anything that happens when she\u2019s not with him.\n\nMy father never cheated on her. And she never cheated on him either. My mother never found anything strange on his phone or anything. It\u2019s like she randomly decided he might have someone else. And every time she gets the proof that nothing has been going on, she gets better until the next day.\n\nThe first few weeks, she asked me to help her going through his messages since she doesn\u2019t really understand technology. And I accepted, telling myself that she might have reasons to doubt, and that whatever we might find she will at least see the end of her anxiety rises.\n\nAfter some time, I figured that when she will never be satisfied. She was persuaded she just didn\u2019t search enough if she didn\u2019t find anything suspicious. So I stopped helping her, and she understood, but she keeps telling me about it.

It sounds like your dad is doing the right thing, but you mom needs external help, that is clear. You shouldn't be involved anymore than you choose (and I support your choice to stay out of their relationship issues completely, good call!)

In fact, everything counted as proof. If the colleague got delayed in the traffic, then they of course had stopped somewhere to have sex. If the colleague came home earlier than expected - then it was because they was trying to hide the affair by looking innocent, etc etc \n\nAs you say, just like your mum, the spouse really didn't want to admit that there was something wrong and didn't want any kind of help or treatment. \n\nEventually, they got there. There was several possible options that could cause this problem. After disregarding dementia or mental illness (not sure what dementia qualifies as) and other stuff as brain tumours, it turned out it was caused by some kind of deficiency. (Think iron deficiency, but it was something else). So with the correct treatment, the issue totally disappeared. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't recall what kind of deficiency it was, but I'll echo the others and say that if possible, your mum should seek help.
