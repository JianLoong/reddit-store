We'll call that client \"the singer\" and her husband \"the husband\". The singer seemed absolutely fine in the beginning, she approached me and asked for a proposal, I gave the proposal as well as attended a free face to face meeting in which I explained that the process should be done within two months, considering that we have all the necessary documents. The singer wanted a bank account for her company and a certain tax exemption certificate.\n\nShortly after starting, I realised that the singer is missing most of the documents, so I had to help her gather them in order to start the application. This took around a month. Following that, I sent her all the required documents for signature. She sent the documents signed about two weeks later (meaning about a month and a half passed).\n\nDuring this time (about 2 weeks after we met for the first time and while we were gathering the needed docs), the singer asked me to talk to her husband, that needed help with some tax certificates. I talked to him and did what he asked for. I issued an invoice (for 250\u20ac) and for 2 whole months, had to remind the husband that payment is due. He ended up paying two months after he got the invoice (that was due 7 days after it was issued).\n\nSo almost 2.5 months have passed, and only 3 weeks since we actually managed to apply for the singer's tax exemption & bank account.\n\nThat same day, the husband called me and asked for a really complicated project. I agreed, provided my proposal, he accepted it, and I started working. I issued an invoice for half of the amount. When I realised the husband has no intention to pay me anytime soon, I asked for the deposit again, and said that if it isn't paid within a week, I'll have to stop working on the project.\n\nThe husband called me and went insane, saying \"you have no idea who I am\" and basically threatening me to keep working. I quit that same day and asked for the invoice paid (I didn't ask for the whole amount, only payment for the work already done). I also mentioned that I will cooperate and finish what I started doing for the singer.\n\nNow we're 3.5 months in and the singer's certificate was delivered to my office, as well as her bank account opened. I asked her to pay the amounts due for her and her husband to deliver it, and she refuses to do so until she gets the docs.\n\nI am worried that once they have the docs, they won't pay me, so I told them that I will not release the docs until i'm paid the full amount. They say i'm an asshole because I quit mid-project and that they refuse to pay me as i'm \"not reliable\" and they want to see the documents first.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687772341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jcob4/aita_for_holding_a_clients_document_hostage_until/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure where he is, but at least here in the US we *cannot* withhold our client's own documents.  I can't refuse to return someone's W2, for example, just because they refuse to finish up with me or pay me.  Even if I've done *all* of the work short of getting their signature and efiling the return.\n\nI do not give them the return or any of the working papers I have prepared, but their original documents go *right back* to them and I send them on their way.  The moment the client makes a move to disengage, they get their documents back.  The moment *I* make a move to disengage, they get their documents back.  The moment the client says they want their documents back, they get their documents back.\n\nIn fact, if we get as far as finalizing the return and taking an 8879 e-file authorization signature, we're really not even supposed to \"bank\" the return until payment - it should be e-filed and any late invoice sent to collections.\n\nI'm not clear on whether he's actually returned her original documents used to prepare the applications (including the ones he helped her source - work he should certainly be paid for) or if he's still holding those in a file.  And I can't quite figure out the status of the tax certificate.  Whether it's been applied for and approved or not.  If so, if this is a finalized certificate and all the work on it is done but the payment and delivery, he probably shouldn't be holding onto a certificate issued in her name by a gov't agency.  He's not in the position of the university in that case, the gov't agency is.\n\nHe probably *should* fire these clients and put this account into collections.\n\nEh, honestly, he probably shouldn't even be asking this here.  He should be asking his errors and omissions insurance.  You *do* have insurance, right, OP?", "I\u2019m sorry, but this is very unlikely. This is not a question for us, it\u2019s a question for your governing body, or at least your insurance provider. While you are entitled to withhold work product, I cannot think of any private profession that allows you to hold on to client ID or documents.", "I'm not in the US (based in the EU) and definitely not breaking the law. I'm a tax attorney.\nEthics wise? I wouldn't keep the docs if they paid or at least showed an interest to."]}
