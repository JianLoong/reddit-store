We'll call that client \"the singer\" and her husband \"the husband\". The singer seemed absolutely fine in the beginning, she approached me and asked for a proposal, I gave the proposal as well as attended a free face to face meeting in which I explained that the process should be done within two months, considering that we have all the necessary documents. The singer wanted a bank account for her company and a certain tax exemption certificate.\n\nShortly after starting, I realised that the singer is missing most of the documents, so I had to help her gather them in order to start the application. This took around a month. Following that, I sent her all the required documents for signature. She sent the documents signed about two weeks later (meaning about a month and a half passed).\n\nDuring this time (about 2 weeks after we met for the first time and while we were gathering the needed docs), the singer asked me to talk to her husband, that needed help with some tax certificates. I talked to him and did what he asked for. I issued an invoice (for 250\u20ac) and for 2 whole months, had to remind the husband that payment is due. He ended up paying two months after he got the invoice (that was due 7 days after it was issued).\n\nSo almost 2.5 months have passed, and only 3 weeks since we actually managed to apply for the singer's tax exemption & bank account.\n\nThat same day, the husband called me and asked for a really complicated project. I agreed, provided my proposal, he accepted it, and I started working. I issued an invoice for half of the amount. When I realised the husband has no intention to pay me anytime soon, I asked for the deposit again, and said that if it isn't paid within a week, I'll have to stop working on the project.\n\nThe husband called me and went insane, saying \"you have no idea who I am\" and basically threatening me to keep working. I quit that same day and asked for the invoice paid (I didn't ask for the whole amount, only payment for the work already done). I also mentioned that I will cooperate and finish what I started doing for the singer.\n\nNow we're 3.5 months in and the singer's certificate was delivered to my office, as well as her bank account opened. I asked her to pay the amounts due for her and her husband to deliver it, and she refuses to do so until she gets the docs.\n\nI am worried that once they have the docs, they won't pay me, so I told them that I will not release the docs until i'm paid the full amount. They say i'm an asshole because I quit mid-project and that they refuse to pay me as i'm \"not reliable\" and they want to see the documents first.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687772341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jcob4/aita_for_holding_a_clients_document_hostage_until/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
