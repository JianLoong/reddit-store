When I came home my mother and stepfather decided to sit me down and gave a whole lecture on how I'm an adult and I need to start paying rent because they weren't gonna house adults for free. Even though my stepdad's 23-year-old son lives here for free but that's beside the point.\n\nThey told me that I would start paying $650 every first of the month starting on July 1st. I tried to bring up how my stepbrother doesn't pay anything and it was unfair to spring this on me when I just turned 18 but they responded that I must have the money since I went shopping today. Now, let me tell you, I pay for everything I have (phone, my car which isn't under any of their names, my clothes, and even the food I eat because they claim I eat too much even though I don't) SO I agreed I would but then since I was paying for everything I own they no longer could treat me like I'm a kid. \n\nInstead of them looking at me like I'm their kid/stepkid I would be looked at as a tenant. They no longer could give me curfews, I would be disabling my life360, and they no longer could just barge into my room because I pay for it, and they no longer demand anything from me besides rent on the 1st of every month. I also told them that if they couldn't follow my rules since I'm paying rent then I will go rent a room somewhere else. This started an argument, and they started yelling about how I'm disrespectful and that this was their house, and they didn't have to follow any rules of mine, so I just left. Now, I've been getting calls from family calling me ungrateful and that my mother could kick me out.

At least on the Virginia side", "Damn where the hell is this if you dont mind me asking, every place I look unless I want to travel into Trump country is like 1-2k a month without utilities, would love to live in a place with a great mix of people for a reasonable price!", "So funny I was reading your comment and was like yep that sounds right for rent where I am\u2026we\u2019re in the same place! Yay Louisville.", "That\u2019s absolutely true.", "Wait, what? No, self employment income isn't going to apply here. OP Parents are certainly not bona fide real estate professionals and thus it would actually be wrong of them to include the rent on a sch C, it should be a Sch E and could possibly be tax advantageous of them to start writing off their house through depreciation, utilites and upgrades.\n\nAlso if they DID have to pay SE, they'd get to deduct half of SE tax whether or not they itemize, it's a front page deduction and not something itemized", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to spring it on them either, so we told them both at 14 so that they\u2019ll have time to figure out with help what\u2019s best for them. Quite honestly we just want to move and travel when they\u2019re grown and don\u2019t want to be stuck with a house size we don\u2019t need or want and don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that we should have to put that on hold until we\u2019re too old to do what we\u2019d like because they want to be influencers who play video games and eat junk food all day like so many people that you hear about in their 20s or 30s. If I\u2019m helping them save to start their own business or making it so that they can afford grad school or their own home, fine. I\u2019m more than happy to do so. But I\u2019m not subsidizing slackers.", "Sounds like good advice that probably gets overlooked more than it should. How do you go about doing this?", "Very good point!", "Do we know where OP lives? I'm just curious because I was under the understanding that in some place without a rental agreement OP would not be a tenant and that the parents may be able to classify her as an adult child at home helping pay the bills VS a source of income and may not have to pay tax on that.\n\nI'd just encourage OP to know the rules where they live before they accuse their parents of tax fraud.", "That won't happen just because she claims a renter's credit, unless there is an audit. The forms do not require you to identify the landlord; they just have you declare renter status to claim the credit.\n\nOP needs to report the rent as income paid to the parents. Also needs to file a return in which she claims she is no one's dependent. She should do this right at the beginning of January so hers is on file first.", "It\u2019s not deductible, but it is part of the benefit calculation for some provincial benefits. But yeah, in the strictest sense, rent is not deductible (except maybe as an employment expenses in some very specific circumstances). But it is generally taxable to your landlord!", "So it's not semantics. There is a very big difference between parents charging their kids to eat. And parents saying \"you eat too much, you have to buy your own food\" \n\nNeither are good, but one is about controlling food access which is worse.", "We had gas and electric. About $300 total. Plus we paid $300 every 3 months for water.", "Sure, but that's DC. An hour outside of Pittsburgh is cheap. An hour outside of New Orleans is cheap. There are always a few cities like DC, San Francisco, and New York that are exceptions.", "Yay Louisville, lol. Every time someone mentions rent elsewhere I grow more content being here haha", "You are correct, rental income receipts are on schedule E not C and the half SE deduction can be taken in conjunction with the standard deduction.\n\nThe parents become commercial renters as soon as they enter into a rent agreement with a tenant at a property they own. You don't have to be a \"bona fide real estate professional\" (not quite sure what that means) to owe taxes on rental income. You just need to own property that you rent out for money.", "Go to irs.gov", "I really don't think you thought any of this through...", "Bona fide real estate professionals is a requirement for moving rental income away from sch e to sch C, normally done so that you can have unlimited losses and don't need to worry about loss carry forwards or loss limitations. They owe ordinary income tax on it, but it's no where near the extra 15.3% you're throwing out. \n\n\n\n\n>The parents become commercial renters as soon as they enter into a rent agreement with a tenant at a property they own. You don't have to be a \"bona fide real estate professional\" (not quite sure what that means) to owe taxes on rental income.

It's pretty clear that you don't fully understand what you're talking about - you know enough to get in the ball park but you're striking out at every bat. I'm glad you like CPAs because it's clear that you should continue using them professionally", "Also, talk to the school's Financial Aid office.  They may not be able to solve things, but they might have some advice for documentation or how to deal with lack of parental support for college expenses.", "For me I had no parents to add to financial aid.  My mom passsd away so I had to fill forms out s dry freaking year with the same thing and emails and statements form other ppl about it. Until I turned 24 I think"]}
