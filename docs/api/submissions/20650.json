Especially if you're just barely able to have anything left over for yourself afterwards, my dad was at least covering stuff still, you're paying for so much more than I was.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTurning 18 and then immediately asked for $650 in rent is insane. You're better off getting your own place", "NTA. Time to go and do well for yourself which it sounds like you already are taking care of what needs to be done. 650 is a lot for just a room. And then the other adult lives there for free? Nope.  You need to keep your own peace for your self. I wish you the best and hope you find a place to call your own soon.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are unfair to charge you rent but not the 23 year old. The price is ridiculous for one room. You were already paying for yourself before 18, so in my mind they should have been paying for your food and phone etc if they are going to pull the 'you're 18 now' card.", "No. Obviously.\n\nPlay nice. Don't let your stuff end up on the street. Look for your own place. Move out amicably ASAP. Good luck!", "NTA, and this is very telling that this is about control and not about principle. You're exactly right \u2014 if you're paying rent, you're a tenant. That shouldn't be a controversial truth.", "NTA, move out. Maybe if they were just asking you to contribute a bit then I'd say they it'd be unreasonable of you to make these rules for them, but they want you to be paying market rate or possibly even more. What exactly is the point of you staying then? You could live with strangers who respect your privacy for the same amount.", "Happy birthday. The thing is that it does not matter whether you are right or wrong. I understand that your mother and stepfather do not act in good faith. You can not win against such people. No matter what you do, you are wrong for them. With your reaction, you prevented their scheme and they are not happy. And, they still want you to do whatever they ask without complaining and force you to full obedience. This is a battle you can't win. Run as fast as you can. I really hope you have the means.", "NTA. Any parent that charges rent to their kid is a fucking rat.", "Sounds like it's time to move out regardless.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m a boomer and the idea of paying rent was more common in my day\u2026BUT\u2026\n\nIt was known far in advance that it would be expected of you.\n\nIt was usually a fairly modest amount - I can\u2019t tell whether $650 is or not for you as I don\u2019t know where you are.\n\nAnd it absolutely did come with the idea that curfews and barging into rooms, etc, were no longer acceptable.

Also the brother not having to pay is NOT besides the point. It is the point! Why should you pay and he gets to live like a normal adult with his parents. You were smart and absolutely right to do what you did and I think if you can find a place to live that is around that same price or cheaper then you should go for it. And maybe try keeping distance from them all together at least for a little while. NTA good luck op", "Lmao NTA, definitely keep this up and move out if they don\u2019t follow your rules. Trust me it\u2019ll be better for you. I\u2019d rather move out than live with the disadvantages of being a tenant AND living with your parents", "OP, if you stay at home you'll also need to pay in a way which shows rent paid (cheque, etc) so that you can claim your rent on taxes.\n\nGood luck OP - they sound seriously awful.", "They want a maid or cash cow. And angry when OP called their greed.\n\n\"Excellent, you are now landlords per our contract. Means I get to call the cops if you come into my room without X hours advanced notice.\" \n\nOP needs to move out. That the mom is on board with this says volumes. Stepdad is just an AH. But the mom being ok with freeloading stepbrother, but OP has to pay that much? Yeah... not good. \n\nAs for the flying monkeys, ask them how much rent they changed their kid on their 18th birthday. Willing to bet the family is being given partial info.", "I would do this but contact the extended family who are harassing her. I\u2019d say she feels bad for what happened but could they come with her to mum and stepdad to act as support to stop things becoming heated. Then go and say you feel bad about what happened and of course you will agree to the same rent step brother was charged when he became an adult. If they could just outline that for you. \n\nI bet the extended family harassing her on their behalf don\u2019t know about stepbrother paying nothing.", "This. Take that $650/month and split a place with some friends if possible.", "I agree NTA. \n\nBut one thing. $650 for one room is damn good these days. Pre covid I paid $850 on one basement room with no windows in DC. \n\nA one room studio in a decent apartment complex is $1500, sometimes not including utilities. \n\nNow asking your just 18y.o daughter to pay that is insane, and heartless. But that price is good in this market", "Lol it\u2019s $800-$900 to rent a room in a house with roommates where I live. Bachelor/1bd apartments/suites are like $1,400 at least. And then paying for water (some apartments will include water in rent), hydro, internet, cable if you want it, most suites have shared laundry with either another tenant(s) or landlord and their family upstairs. Or laundry room for apartments that are like $1.75-$2.50 a load per machine.", "Well tbh, the price sounds good for a regular roommate situation. \n\nBut in her parents house and with still having to follow their child rules, and what only a few days notice to someone who JUST turned 18 and is barely even out of high school it's insane.\n\nOP, seriously, disable the life360. Get it off your phone. And find a place to live with roommates if they want to charge you this much while letting your stepbrother off the hook at 23.\n\nNTA", "No - it depends on what rents are in a particular area.

She needs to get the heck out of there ASAP", "I'm not confused.  Step son is the golden child.  They will continue to support him no matter what and OP will be expected to bail them out and take care of them in their old age.", "Best advice so far on this subject.", "Honestly it\u2019s not token but it\u2019s less than they will spend renting somewhere & feeding themselves in a city. Being alive is expensive", "It\u2019s not hilarious for her she\u2019s probably not financially prepared for this and only working part time. I got dragged out by my hair at 15 for smoking weed on the side of the house and dropped off at a CVS with a trash bag of my clothes. Luckily I had a friend who\u2019s parents felt for me enough to allow me to stay with them for a while hopefully OP can manage without them. They\u2019re awful parents and her mom is spineless and brainwashed to demand money from her", "NTA. Well done on setting your boundaries. You\u2019re absolutely right.", "Seems very much a *main* point\u2026 what the hell is wrong w these people. OP appears to be much smarter than the rest of em, also NTA like them either", "I never get the logic these parents have just suddenly springing it on their kid at 18??? Like if the parents are renting a house or apartment they would have to be given notice for ANYTHING! Landlord raising rent, entering premises, eviction etc. like fine if you want to charge your kid rent when they turn 18, but give them a heads up at the very least!! Like \u201chello my child who is now 15 and starting working. Letting you know that you are free to live here after you turn 18 and graduate, but once you are 18, you will be expected to pay rent starting the following month.\u201d And then it also gives time for BOTH parties to establish rules and boundaries and how each of them are viewing it working. \n\nSpringing it as a surprise is in no way teaching them/prepping them for the real world.", "Just curious, why does OP suck here? I can def. understand the others though. Thx.", "Depends on the area but a city like DC is going to be way higher than most places in the country. \n\nAlso NTA", "You don\u2019t know their market. One town I had a one bedroom, utilities covered at $650. Another town I had a two bedroom, no utilities, also $650. That two bedroom is only $750 now 8 years later. So yeah, one room in someone else\u2019s place for $650 is literally insane in at least half of America", "Jumping on this comment to let OP know that if you use something like Facebook marketplace (do your darn homework on these people). You can find a much cheaper apartment. Smaller landlords tend to sometimes advertise that way and their rent is much cheaper. \n\nSource: That's how I'm paying $1300 for a decent sized 2bd 1.5ba and only pay for gas/electric in a major city, USA.", "DC is HCOL though.  I pay 928 for a 3 bedroom 2 bath house so it\u2019s all relative.", "It really depends on where you live. Rent for a townhouse (2.5bed, 1.5bath) I was in last year was like $950. Now I\u2019m in a house (granted having a win win sort of thing with friends), but am paying $700 plus utilities.", "Idk, 650 for one room is PRICEY where I live. You can get a three bedroom decent apartment for about 1200-1600, which if you have roommates that\u2019s only like 400-500 each or so. That comes with no parents around, kitchen, bathrooms, etc. \n\nSome of my friends only pay 200 for rent bc of the situation. \n\nIt really depends on the market", "REALLY depends on where this takes place. I'm in Germany paying 450\u20ac for a 1,5 room apartment with balcony, all utilities etc. close to the city center and someplace else you wont even get a room in a shared flat for that price", "Yeah but you also don\u2019t have your parents barging in your room or have a curfew.", "sorry i was being to european to understand.", "Let me clarify what I meant. The way OP dealt with their greedy and unreasonable parents is hilarious. Not the situation itself, which sucks.", "They need to move out", "Oh definitely! Sorry I thought they were just shocked at the price at all.

I hope they can get out and not have to live under these ah\u2019s anymore", "I pay 750$ (post exchange rate) for a room in Northern Europe... so it's relative in Europe as well?", "And that makes them suck?", "Not sure what you\u2019re asking.

I'm not sure what else OP could've done here?", "Explanation on how everyone could have handled it better.", "Discuss their options and state that based on what is being offered, she'd rather move out. They have to give her a minimum of 1 month.", "> SO I agreed I would but then since I was paying for everything I own they no longer could treat me like I'm a kid. Instead of them looking at me like I'm their kid/stepkid I would be looked at as a tenant.\n\n> **I also told them that if they couldn't follow my rules since I'm paying rent then I will go rent a room somewhere else.**\n\nIsn't that exactly what she did?"]}
