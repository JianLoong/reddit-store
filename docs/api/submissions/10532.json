My grandma and I had a similar type of bond when I was a kid and then as I got older, she consistently implied I was the  directly responsible for her happiness and would call me constantly/yell at me if I wasn\u2019t giving her enough attention. Then guilt trip me by saying how hard it was to go from getting to see me all the time as a kid to barely getting calls from me (as I got older I became more interested in hanging out with friends my age bc duh. I still saw her multiple times a month but it was never enough for her). It was really traumatizing and took years of therapy/moving across the country to move on from basically being my grandma\u2019s emotional support animal and therapist for my whole childhood. It\u2019s really concerning to me that your mom is so dependent on being around your daughter to the point where she\u2019ll throw a tantrum if she can\u2019t see her - that\u2019s incredibly unhealthy and exactly what my grandma would do. Protect your daughter because she\u2019s too young to understand how this could affect her long term.", "NTA - you daughter's welfare overrides what your mum wants.  I've been there with overtired kids who are not enjoying themselves, and end up causing you to not enjoy yourself and possibly disrupt the event. And then there is the next day too.\n\nLook at it this way - your daughter is not your mum's only source of entertainmen and she is a human being who has her own needs. It is lovely that they have a good relationship, but your mum is very wrong to insist that her enjoying herself more by having your daughter there, is more important than your child getting a good night of sleep.", "NTA. Long events like that can be difficult for kids that age. You would have had to cut your day short for sure. She sees your daughter practically daily. You're allowed a CF evening.", "NTA - You're not being vindictive or anything like that and you would still be responsible for looking after your daughter the whole time. Not to mention the aftermath and extra planning of taking her to the kind of event described. Your mum won't be the one who has to deal with all that.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom should've been focused on the wedding, not that your kid wasn't there. If your kid was her priority during the wedding, she needs to reevaluate things.", "NTA, you made a decision based on what is best for your child, and your mother making your child\u2019s health and happiness about her is really worrisome. She actually sounds a lot like my grandmother\u2014 I was the favorite grandchild growing up and it meant often being exhausted or overwhelmed by my grandma\u2019s need to spoil me/take me to different things, and uncomfortable with her bragging about me. It also strained my relationship with my cousins because my grandma bought me gifts and treated me to other special things the others didn\u2019t get, even when one of my cousins lived with my grandparents. I\u2019d just be careful with the way this is heading as it could end up being hard for your daughter to navigate as she gets older.\n\nETA: it\u2019s also rude to your nephew that she implied that she couldn\u2019t be happy for him and his spouse! Who complains that they didn\u2019t enjoy a wedding because someone who wasn\u2019t getting married was absent? Her focus should have been on THEIR day!", "NTA. I'm sorry but I can see she pulled the 'you're breaking my heart' line. I would urge you to try and shut this down should she bring it up again. Weddings can be long and frankly arduous affairs for kids. She wouldn't have lasted till the end and unless your Mother was willing/able to take her back when your daughter started to get restless then you would have had to cut your evening short. You shouldn't feel guilty about this.", "NTA\nIt's wonderful her and your daughter are so close. But you are still her parents, and you have sound reasoning for your choice.", "NTA. You didn't take your daughter to the wedding. \n\nYou are a good man for caring about your mom's feelings, but ultimately your first responsibilities are as a husband and father, your mom comes third.\n\nPlease don't feel guilty about putting your wife and child's needs before your mother's wants. You did the right thing.", "NTA, but please keep a close watch on this relationship. Your mother sounds like she\u2019s treating your daughter like a pet or a toy, not a child who needs to be cared for with respect to her actual well-being. Little kids shouldn\u2019t be expected to stay up until 1 am, or spoiled endlessly, or loudly favored over their siblings or cousins. Your daughter is likely to end up with behavior problems and a bad character if she\u2019s spoiled all the time like this, and your poor son will feel resentful and rejected if he isn\u2019t equally favored.", "NTA\n\nOuch, I feel sorry for your nephew. But, you were concerned about giving your daughter good habits instead of bad one.", "NTA  your small child\u2019s needs come before grandmas wants. Also you need to put an end to the favorite grandchild talk now and start placing some boundaries. Favoritism can ruin families. Do you want your child to feel responsible as the favorite to make grandma happy?

In my culture, weddings are extremely important, so if children are welcome (not always the case), they should be brought, if only so they can see some of their more distant family that they only have a few opportunities in lifetime to meet - a few days of sleeping problems are a weak excuse compared to that. Or you could have someone (maybe your mom) take her out of the party early.\n\nBut what's done is done. And your mom's reason why your daughter should've been there are pretty dumb.

The grandmother home skooled the child and never let her out of her sight... Yes even bathroom breaks the kid would get bathed by grandma and there was a chair in the bathroom...\n\nThis was all blamed on me because of how heartbroken and devastating it was to loose me and that she could not stand for it to happen to another one of her children... And then it was expected that I call her grandma and call her every single day it was even suggested that I moove closer or moove in with them... She want to k ow what I was doing where I was every waking second of the day...\n\nNeedless to say that relationship lasted a week and everyone was blocked... She died recently and it was my fault because she died of a broken heart... I don't know what happened to the kid she hated her mom when I last saw them...", "Exactly what my wife said.

Not because of not taking your daughter to the wedding but for failing to be a parent and enforce appropriate boundaries.\n\nYou've allowed your mother to use your daughter like Prozac.

Your mother demanded her presence despite you telling her this wouldn\u2019t be good for your daughter or your family in general. She doesn\u2019t care that it was bad for all of you guys, she wanted what she wanted. \n\nI\u2019m going to add in that my own grandmother was obsessive over me and my cousins when we were small. My older cousin was and still is the favourite no matter what messed up shit he does repeatedly, I\u2019m now the black sheep to her because I didn\u2019t want to do what she wanted. She stopped talking to me because I wanted to celebrate my 30th birthday with my mother for dinner. She and I had the same birthday, and she always made me spend the entire day watching her get visitors and gifts and calls. Since birth. I wanted ONE birthday dinner, I was still going to see her but I didn\u2019t want to stay for dinner. I got blanked for MONTHS. Now it\u2019s been 4 years OP. I have barely if ever spoken to her, she actively dislikes me and all because I said no once. \n\nI realised that her blatant hatred for my mother and her parental alienation of me and my cousins had gone on for far too long. My oldest cousin stayed, and gets everything on a sliver platter. He\u2019s turned into a vile human being, using people, cheated on his fianc\u00e9e with her sister, causing her to spiral into her eating disorder, nearly killed her. He kept her around after until he got someone else pregnant. Now he\u2019s just fucked off travelling for two months leaving his kid and partner at home while he gallivants across another country. \n\nEither your daughter will be me, once she realises your mother is favouring her and demanding things of her she doesn\u2019t want to do. Or she will be my older cousin, and turn into a selfish monster. The third option would be my younger cousin, who was often the scapegoat when we were children. She just feels guilty constantly for not setting herself on fire to keep our grandmother warm. None of those options are okay, and not what you want for your kid. \n\nShe\u2019s five now, but she will notice things aren\u2019t equal, she will notice that she\u2019s being told to go places and be there all the time, when maybe she won\u2019t want to. \n\nThe most important thing is your daughter is a person, no pressure this heavy to keep an adult happy should be placed on someone so young.", "sounds like your mom is obsessed with your kid. limit the time they spend together and maybe therapy NTA", "NTA do you know it would not be good for your daughter, and the two of you wanted an evening without kids to enjoy yourselves.

Not normal grandma stuff (like a chocolate bar after dinner or unlimited soda) but big things. Everything I did was ok because they said it was ok and I was their favorite. \n\nI am 22 and it took the first 16-17 years of my life to undo the entitlement that they caused me to feel.

My grandmother was like this (but not to the extent that yours is) in terms of obsessing over me. She has been asking when I will have a boyfriend since I was about 13.
