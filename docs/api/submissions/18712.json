Someone who leaves messes like that for other people to find and clean up is TA, and someone who reacts that way is definitely TA.\n\nMake sure that you contact HR as well, though- you don't know what kind of story he's going to give, and talk to your coworkers to make sure there are others who can verify your story.", "NTA you didn't even know it was him and he's not the only one using the stalls, so you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\n\nHim taking as a personal attack means that he was aware he was pissing all over the place and couldn't be bothered not to leave his mess for some one else to deal with.

Put those signs back up!", "NTA. You didn't intentionally humiliate or target this guy. He needed to clean up after himself.

Had a problem with 'dirty' toilets where I work.  Only the gents loo, the ladies always kept their place clean.

You handled it the right way. It's not your fault he took it as an attack.", "NTA.\n\nThe issue isn't his shy bladder, it's him passing on communal property.", "NTA. You didn't call anyone out. You asked for people to clean up after themselves. He obviously knew what he was doing and instead of cleaning up after himself he took offense and started getting a commotion. It's unsanitary. Honestly I would go to your boss about the problem to give them a heads up if what is going on. I do have to say the sign was probably not the correct one to use as it probably made the guy feel like a child.", "NTA he outed himself. I hope he cleans up from now on.", "NTA\n\n\"We aim to please, so aim too, please!\"", "NTA. Some guys spray more than others. It's an anatomy thing.  My ex did, and therefore he sat to pee.  His sons, inheriting his anatomy, learned very quickly to sit to pee or clean up after themselves, because Mom didn't want to have to sit down in your pee and would make you come clean it up whatever you might be doing.  I could tell which one did it, too.  (Because the pong of a boy just on the cusp of adolescence is different than the pong of the one who is more or less physically adult.)  \n\nSo at least their partners/roommates will thank me.  And now maybe their coworkers too.", "NTA, and please update. Would love to know how HR responds.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He called me an asshole for making him embarrass himself and that he was going to HR.\" .. So go and report it first.

I don\u2019t care what anyone\u2019s reasonings are for missing, just clean it up lol. That\u2019s not an out of line expectation for a shared restroom", "NTA\n\nHis behavior is disgusting.  He pees all over the stall.  He should be sitting down on the seat.", "NTA and you should go to HR first. You didn't out him, but it may not have been your place to put the signs up. Either way, his reaction was as out of control as his stream.", "NTA, he embarrassed himself", "There's a thing you gotta learn about us guys...after a certain age, nothing embarrasses us. That nonsense is for kids.\n\nEdit: I assume a guy in his 20's downvoted this. It's okay, he'll learn eventually.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, using a toilet when you could use the urinal makes anybody an asshole.\n\nSecondly, what is he, 5? I learned not to piss on the seat by then, why didn't he?", "You didn't write it in a way that directly targets him, but you could've said it in a way that wasn't so... Childish and demeaning. Why couldn't you have just said \"please wipe the seat\" or something.", "OP YTA.....why can't you just use a different stall that's clean? Why do you have to embarrass EVERYONE in the office? Don't do that again. Just use your clean stall and let the man use the bathroom in peace.
