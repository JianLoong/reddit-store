My guess is if someone else came in, or were seen going in decided to not wipe boogers, or leave their shit-plosion there for the next person to see.", "Yeah, my husband too. He says it is just more efficient!", "HRs where I live don't have dealing with pee, shit and boogers in their duties list. I'm so surprised.", "I did mention it to the HR lady and she then went on a rant about used tampons and pads and how people are disgusting. I figured it was easier to send something out myself. I had an ensuite in my office, but heard the complaints so figured it was an easy thing to do. \n\nFrankly it wasn't in my job description, but I felt an email was easy to send. \n\nNot sure if the lady's bathroom got better, but then again didn't know there were problems with it before mentioning the men's to HR.", "I really gotta wonder. What's that guy do at home?", "It's not a problem that you mentioned it. I just imagined I'm HR where I live and I received a report \"there's shit in toilet bowl\". I would be hella confused as to what it has to do with me, and why would someone be telling me such disgusting things, I don't need to know that. I'm extremely surprised that it's different in other places. Because to me it sounds like if you went to your IT support guy to report it.", "I'll put money down he does the same thing and expects his wife to clean it up every time."]}
