I have an older sister, 24f \u2018Lily\u2019 who doesn\u2019t live at home anymore. We both were/are in dance lessons, and get dance costumes to keep every so often, sometimes you buy them. Anyway, by now lily has about 45-50 dance costumes to keep, but she left them at home in a storage closet. \n\nFor spring cleaning, my mom went through it and wanted her costumes out. She asked Lily if she would move them to her apartment but Lily said no, she wanted them to stay at home. So my mom asked if I could fit them all in my closet. I don\u2019t have any dance costumes, even if they\u2019re boughten ones to keep I always donate them back to the studio for future use, but Lily keeps all her boughten ones. When my mom asked if they could fit in my closet she assumed because I \u201cdon\u2019t have much clothes, and I don\u2019t have other costumes to take up space\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t have closet space, because my closet is microscopic. I can\u2019t hang 50 floofy, sparkly tutus and dresses and things without getting rid of half my clothes. I told my mom I wasn\u2019t going to keep them in my closet, Lily had to take them or find somewhere else to put them. \n\nMy mom told Lily that she was going to donate her costumes to the studio if she didn\u2019t take them, now lily is mad at me that I didn\u2019t store her things. Apparently she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to keep them and she doesn\u2019t want them donated, so she\u2019s really upset about it. I feel really bad I don\u2019t want to store them and make her get rid of them, but at the same time idk if I could make room AITA?", "created_utc": 1681496293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m72w4/aita_for_not_wanting_old_dance_costumes_in_my/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry sometimes things need to be gotten rid of if they aren't being used and most likely will never be used.", "NTA\n\nYour sister can rent a storage unit if she really wants to keep them along with other things. While each kid will always be their parent's children, the parents should be able to make space for their lives once the children start moving out. Your sister is well into adulthood and living on her own. She needs to stop treating the parents' house as a storage unit for her costumes. It shouldn't be expected that your room/closet act as a storage unit for your sisters' things either.", "NTA Don't enable hoarders. Its very easy to store stuff at other peoples houses forever. \n\nThis isn't a temporary storage issue; its been going on for 10 years.

The mistake the memory for the thing and feel they'll lose those memories or even their childhood if they don't keep that thing.\n\nIt's not really a problem if the person takes those things with them when they move away but it's a big problem to their parents, etc who have to deal with their stuff.\n\nIf she doesn't want them and she won't take them in a reasonable time, then she abandoned those things. They're fair game.\n\nI knew a woman who bought - and paid for - a small china closet that had been in her bedroom as a child. It sat in the corner and had to be screwed in to stay in place so it wouldn't fall on people. Nice cabinet but once she bought it, it needed to go. Her mother had that in that room for 10 years or so before she finally took it.\n\nLily needs to get the dresses and anything else she wants or your parents should charge her a storage fee (or pitch it all).

Tell your sister to get a small storage unit if she doesn't want the dresses going or tell her to ask a friend cause you don't have storage room either.\n\nEdit: Vacuum storage bags are also very useful and cheaper than a storage unit if your sister says she can't afford a monthly bill for storage.", "I am imagining how a 24 yr old would fit into costumes from her teens.\n\nLily doesn't live at home, you do.
