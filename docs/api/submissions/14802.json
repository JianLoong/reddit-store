I have an older sister, 24f \u2018Lily\u2019 who doesn\u2019t live at home anymore. We both were/are in dance lessons, and get dance costumes to keep every so often, sometimes you buy them. Anyway, by now lily has about 45-50 dance costumes to keep, but she left them at home in a storage closet. \n\nFor spring cleaning, my mom went through it and wanted her costumes out. She asked Lily if she would move them to her apartment but Lily said no, she wanted them to stay at home. So my mom asked if I could fit them all in my closet. I don\u2019t have any dance costumes, even if they\u2019re boughten ones to keep I always donate them back to the studio for future use, but Lily keeps all her boughten ones. When my mom asked if they could fit in my closet she assumed because I \u201cdon\u2019t have much clothes, and I don\u2019t have other costumes to take up space\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t have closet space, because my closet is microscopic. I can\u2019t hang 50 floofy, sparkly tutus and dresses and things without getting rid of half my clothes. I told my mom I wasn\u2019t going to keep them in my closet, Lily had to take them or find somewhere else to put them. \n\nMy mom told Lily that she was going to donate her costumes to the studio if she didn\u2019t take them, now lily is mad at me that I didn\u2019t store her things. Apparently she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to keep them and she doesn\u2019t want them donated, so she\u2019s really upset about it. I feel really bad I don\u2019t want to store them and make her get rid of them, but at the same time idk if I could make room AITA?", "created_utc": 1681496293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m72w4/aita_for_not_wanting_old_dance_costumes_in_my/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're fair game.\n\nI knew a woman who bought - and paid for - a small china closet that had been in her bedroom as a child.

Tell your sister to get a small storage unit if she doesn't want the dresses going or tell her to ask a friend cause you don't have storage room either.\n\nEdit: Vacuum storage bags are also very useful and cheaper than a storage unit if your sister says she can't afford a monthly bill for storage.", "I am imagining how a 24 yr old would fit into costumes from her teens.\n\nLily doesn't live at home, you do.
