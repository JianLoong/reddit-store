Wtf, her son is a racist little s*** and your son should apologize because of it? Nah", "NTA. Actions and statements have consequences. Your child should not apologize for being a decent human and standing up for you/their family. It shouldn't have been necessary.", "I want to say NTAH, I can not.  Your son was in the wrong for escalating a verbal offence to a physical altercation.", "NTA. 15? I thought they were little children! (Not that it would change anything, but I\u2019d understand a mother of a 5 year old asking for leniency for her kid who still has a lot to learn, I\u2019d still say no). Of course your son will not do shit about that racist. At 15 he should know better. Each got the punishment the school deemed appropriate. The end.", "NTA. Do not give in. You must not give in.", "Nta. He learned that racism at home. Kids aren't born racist they learn it.", "NTA \n\nHer son was the one who made racist remarks.    He will learn that in this world there are consequences for actions and being shunned for what he did is the consequence.  \n\nYou are not being selfish.   Why should your son apologize for defending his mother from vile insults?   \n\nFifteen is old enough to know better and learn from his mistakes.", "1. How did she get your number?\n2. What would your son be apologizing for?\nNTA \n\nETA: if you\u2019re concerned about the other child, your son can simply tell his friends that the kid apologized and you are all moving on.", "NTA. Your kid did nothing wrong. And if you force him to apologize not only is that sending a bad message to your son. But it\u2019s also telling the other kid that what they said was ok. The son didn\u2019t even apologize himself!! His mom did it for him! That boy is 100% coddled. Don\u2019t ever make your son apologize!", "NTA. If my teen did that, I would have dragged him to your house and thrown him at your feet to beg your forgiveness... if he was lucky. Don't apologize, don't back down. \n\nMaybe you should donate a cultural feast for that class. Give the decent kids a chance to learn and enjoy something new about a country some of them obviously don't know much about. And it gives the little bigot a choice: be gracious and apologize and praise the food, or choke on his own vileness in front of the class", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re 100% right.\n\nListen, I was a \u2018shy, quiet kid\u2019 at that age, and you know what I said to people most of the time? Fuck-all, because I would rather have gnawed my own arm off than get people angry with me over my opinions.\n\nHe\u2019s well and truly old enough to know better, but he still chose to open his mouth and let that garbage spill out. Bumping into people is a mistake. Picking up the wrong school bag because you thought it was yours is a mistake. Saying racist shit and then doubling down on it when confronted? That\u2019s deliberate, and if there are social consequences, maybe he\u2019ll choose not to do that again.", "NTA , how shy is this kid really ? If his school life gets worse after that it\u2019s because he deserved it", "NTA, sounds like the son learnt those hateful comments from his mother.", "NTA-- Your son has nothing to apologize for. The other kid brought whatever flack he is going to get on himself. I could see you asking your son not to target him or harass him when he gets back (Edit: I'm not suggesting you need to or should, but it seems a reasonable idea), but your son doesn't owe him anything. It certainly isn't your son's job to rehabilitate racist loners.", "NTA. Racism should not be tolerated, in any form! Asking someone to \u201capologize\u201d for an action they just got freshly reprimanded by society for (suspension), seeps ignorance and privilege. She should correct HER OWN KID. I\u2019m sorry you and your son experienced that.", "NTA- \n\nNope, your job is to your son not to this other random kid who says bold racist stuff in the middle of class.", "NTA - she should know life isn't fair. I'm glad your son stuck up for himself and his family.", "Absolutely positively NTA. And it sounds like the school handled it correctly, too.", "NTA the kid needs to not be a little racist brat. Wonder if he picked it up at home.", "NTA!\n\nPart of that kids learning process is to suffer the consequences of his actions.  His parents are not doing him a favor by trying shield him from this.\n\nBTW - The apple never falls far from the tree.  The kid probably got his racial attitude from his parents.", "This is difficult but I'm gonna go with either NAH/ESH because at the end of the day, physical violence should not be condoned unless it is against physical violence. A teenage boy shouldn't learn the lesson that fighting someone that insults you is okay. Maybe privately reinforce he was right to stand up for himself but agree to not take out his frustration like that again and have him apologize for starting a physical fight. IF AND ONLY IF, and this is important: the other kid apologizes too. It's not enough for the mom to apologize; if she expects your son to vocalize the lesson that violence is wrong, her son should be able to vocalize the lesson that racism is wrong. I don't give a fuck if he's shy, he should own up to his mistake if he genuinely understands it's wrong. Otherwise he gets what he deserves.\n\nSo yeah, moms protecting their kids...it's complicated.\n\nTacking on at the end that I am not white if that means anything to anyone.", "The only thing missing here is a pic of you dropping the mic.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nHer son is a racist asshole.  If he gets shunned it's not because your son is popular, it's because he's a racist asshole and nobody likes racist assholes.", "NTA   the mother tought him how to think, you don't learn to think that way by yourself. \n\nAbsolutely do not make your son apologize, he did nothing wrong. \n\nIf the mother keeps bothering you, tell her the right thing to be done, is for her son to apologize to your son publicly.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form. What is wrong with your friends?", "NTA\n\nDon't do sh\\*t.", "NTA \n\nAt 15 if he thinks it's okay shes been a shitty mom by not instilling in her son not to say racist things. \n\nHe's 15 cause and effect your not burning his bridges. He is burning them by being racist.", "NTA. \u2018He made a mistake but doesn\u2019t deserve to be shunned by it.\u2019 Umm, yes. He deserves exactly that. Maybe he would learn how it feels to be discriminated against", "NTA. NO. Absolutely not. \nSo her son needs to live with the consequences of his own actions? Good. He is not in any way shape or form entitled to an apology. The audacity to even ask you. \ud83d\ude12", "NTA-\n\nShe should teach her son to not be racist. There are consequences to words we choose to speak, her son spoke the wrong words.", "NTA - it\u2019s pretty clear where the kid is getting his info from.", "NTA Did her son apologize? His mom apologized you said, you didn't say the boy did. What did your son do? You just said he lost it, so I don't know what he is supposed to be apologizing for.\n\nRegardless the school handled the punishments and it is over. She doesn't have the right to request anything of your son.", "1. I assume through mutual acquaintances or she still has my number saved from my son\u2019s birthday invites from when the kids were younger. \n\n2. Being aggressive or something. I\u2019m not sure. Her main issue was that her kid would be isolated because of my son.", "Nta. Yeah this mom is not doing her son any favors by coddling him like this. Likely the kid has no friends and is ostracized because he\u2019s a little spoiled prick.", "Was there physical violence, though?  Sounds more to me like OP\u2019s kid lost his temper and yelled.", "I would just like to clarify that there was no physical fighting as the teacher had managed to separate them. \n\nI talked to my son about the incident and well, he\u2019s never really faced many racism related issues (like I said, he\u2019s white passing) and he didn\u2019t know how to react. The worst, prior to this, was people not believing he was mixed or calling him a liar. \n\nYou\u2019re right though, a mom protecting her kid is always complicated.\n\nThank you for your insight.", "Uh, how about not to be racist in general.", "Very bad comparison. Being discriminated for being a racist is not the same as being discriminated for being Black, Jewish or insert any minority.", "No one should EVER have to learn what it is like to be discriminated against.\nNTA OP, your kid was the victim in this scenario, he has nothing to apologize for. I hope his classmate and their mother learn empathy at some point.", "A thing I often hear from POC is that they get accused of being \"too aggressive\" when really, they had a valid reason for being upset and their actions really weren't all that aggressive. It comes down to tone policing. He was just standing up for you and for himself. He did nothing wrong.", "15 year olds know better than to use slurs, and know how harmful they are. He learned that behavior from somewhere, possibly his mom, and his mom is trying to rug-sweep it. If she doesn't want her kid being isolated, she needs to teach him to take the consequences of his actions and deal with it. NTA, and give your kid a high-five from me for being so awesome. You're raising a good kid, and that other mother should be ashamed of herself for trying to make her son out to be a victim when he's a racist little AH.", "OP indicated a \"fight\".    \nIf it was only a shouting match, then the word \"argument\" would be used.", "Discrimination for your actions is legal.\n\nDiscrimination because of your race or religion is not.\n\n{So yeah, I guess you are right, they are not the same thing}", "Also, no minority should learn how discrimination \u201cfeels like\u201d. Gross."]}
