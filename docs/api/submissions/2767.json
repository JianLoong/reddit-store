That's fucking awful first off.\n\nThe second thing is they apparently don't know your son well enough that they think he's some sort of monster who's going to rally around to torture some other kid. Who the hell do they think you're raising? And also this framing implies that that kid is a victim, he's not a victim he's a bigot.\n\nHonestly it sounds like your \"friends\" do not like you, do not understand what it is like to be victimized, and shouldn't be around you and your family no more", "This right here, some kids are \"quiet\" because they have nothing good to say and people tried to go out of their way to not get them to talk", "That is honestly very refreshing. I live in Florida, ignorance is unfortunately welcomed.", "Part of our job are parents is to monitor what they\u2019re watching, listening to, and spending time with. The internet is a horrifying place and it\u2019s my job to monitor their usage to ensure they don\u2019t become racist, homophobic, misogynistic or other really bad people.", "When they pick it out your house but you don't fix it is your fault anyways.", "If the kid were indoctrinated outside their family, the parents would not be insisting OP\u2019s kid apologize.", "It's such a cop out to blame the internet and video games, this is and will always be responsibility of the parents to make sure their kids are not shitty humans.\n\nEven if we pretend that kid was \"indoctrinated\" by the internet, the mom could have made his racist kid apologize and make amends if she found his behavior wrong, but instead she minimized his actions and blamed the victim for the consequences he got.\n\nI grew up with the same internet and same video games as everyone else and I am not a racist asshole.", "Sure, but in the end it's the parents responsibility to know what their 15 year old is being exposed to or recruited for... they are radicalized in their home. \n\nNo parent can claim that they did not know their child had access to disinformation, only that they chose to ignore it. These same parents would probably protest that certain books should not be readily accessible to their child in the school library.", "If anti racism is discussed at home then this indoctrination would be addressed. Not being a racists was never enough.", "Utter nonsense, that garbage has always existed online, anyone raised with with proper empathy and common sense would see right through it for exactly what it is, racist trash. If a kid is that easily indoctrinated, it's still a parental failing.", "Not me thinking a decade ago was like 1992 until I saw your comment xD", "Should I be happy or scared that I don't know what any of that means if I'm a GenXer?", "Eh, maybe he learned it at home. But don\u2019t underestimate what a mom would do to protect their kid. You can have hard and difficult conversations with your kid, and still not want their high school years to suck because of one bad day. Nor should this kid be outcast for the rest of his life because of what happened. That will only further any views he may have. OP is definitely not the AH. But I don\u2019t agree with tar and feathering the other kid. He\u2019s 15. At a vulnerable learning state. Outcasting him could turn him more set into his thinking, not less. Which isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility. If I were OP, I would use this experience to bring the boys together and talk. But she isn\u2019t obligated.", "I think it just depends. If it\u2019s true that he\u2019s shy and doesn\u2019t have many friends then there is a possibility that those racist chats are getting to him.\n\nSometimes when people don\u2019t have a foundation of a good family and they lack a friend group they cling on to toxic people. Think about how people join those cults and crazy mom groups", "Have you read my comment? I\u2019m saying that the bully should lear what it feels like.", "Not wanting the kid to be tar and feathered is worlds away from what the mom was asking for though. Outcasting is a natural consequence of spouting hateful rhetoric. To ask kids to just be okay with that is disingenuous and won\u2019t serve the racist kid well in the future.", "Emphasis on good family", "Harder to find hate speech on the internet in 1989, you say?\\* I'd have to call bullshit on that. Hate speech is everywhere today in every direction one looks. I just learned about Stormfront just now from your post and you were using Netscape search while you were in college to go there without any warnings or limits. Otherwise, how would you know that? Wow. And, for the record, I just went to the disgusting and awful website myself just now without any warnings or limits; so that hasn't changed. (I'll never go there again as I can't subject myself to such evil.)\n\nI will say that when q-link was the only link to information, and racism accounted for a portion of the service, then that limited amount of racism was probably easy to stumble across, but today there are billions of more sources of hate speech on the internet so it's very easy to come across it today. Also today, hate speech is hidden behind otherwise seemingly well-meaning articles. I can't count the number of times otherwise seemingly reasonable news sources like NY Times, FoxNews, Washington Post, and most others tell their version of a story with a dismissive, stereotypical, and/or racist undertone. \n\n\\*Just the process of getting on the internet in 1989-1995 was very hard, expensive, and difficult, and for the most part limited to nerds and geeks; not the average person.", "Anyone who ever used the blue djinn profile pic on Yahoo for things like playing card games knows what's up with the racism there.  Holy crap.  There seemed to be some weird belief that only black people used it?  And that this was a *problem.*  The N-word would fly and people would get kicked (\"kick the n*\") just for having that profile icon.", "I think the kid will be tar and feathered though. It won\u2019t help his views. It will cement them.", "I think reading is lacking. I did NOT say imply that it was \u201charder to find hate speech internet in 1989\u201d as I wasn\u2019t on the internet at that time I was on qlink as I said. I said that it is was *EASIER* to find hate speech in some earlier eras. Edit: also as the person I was replying to mentioned Stormfront by name that fact that you \u201cnever heard about it too you read my post\u201d confirms the lack of reading. \n\nAs you didn\u2019t read my comment.  I see no reason to read yours the rest of yours.", "I think OP should discourage her son from adding insult to injury but beyond that what can he do?", "You don't know that though.", "\u201cIt was racist and inflammatory\u201d should be more than enough to get her to understand that it\u2019s her kid\u2019s fault, and he needs some pretty serious correction. (It was plenty for most of the comments section)", "Oh, I'm not disagreeing. Personally, I'd be demanding to know as a parent because I'd want to know how I'd rectify kiddo's thinking. I already made my judgement on this, and OP did nothing wrong."]}
