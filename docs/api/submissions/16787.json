The agreement allowed for either party to back a certain distance onto the neighbour's property for the purpose of turning the car around so nobody had to back out of a long driveway onto a busy road.  The neighbour decided one day to landscape this turnaround spot because she did not own a car. Of course when visitors came they always parked on the right of way and we could not pass. The neighbour was angry when we legally forced her to restore her parking space/turnaround area.
