He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother \"Ethan\" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.\n\n\nSome context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy \"Joey\" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.\n\n\nSo fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said \"Knock knock..\" Ethan laughed and said \"Who's there?\". Mike replied \"Joey's bio parents\" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an \"idiot\" to which Mike replied with \"Hey...Relax it was just a joke\". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.\n\n\nWe haven't talked to them for days.

So, he isn\u2019t a jokester, he gets off on seeing people react and then he gaslights people by saying it\u2019s just a joke. Toxic AF. \n\nYTA", "Exactly - the \u201cjoke\u201d isn\u2019t clever or amusing at all, just designed to upset people. YTA for sure.", "The only punchline in this one is the line of the punch he should get to his face.", "I only had to get this far in the post to know he was gonna be TA.", "15 tops", "He did indeed get them to react.  If you're trying to get a rise out of someone, you shouldn't be surprised when you succeed!", "MIKE RUINED the celebration.\n\nWow, idk if I\u2019ve read such an out of touch post on AITA\u2026 ever.\n\nYTA. And so is your husband. \u201cMike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife.\u201d WHAT THE ACTUAL FUDGE. That is TERRIBLE. Teasing an infertile couple about their adopted child\u2019s bio parents? I am mortified.", "Me neither. Seriously, I don't get it?", "I know. I really hope for Joey\u2019s sake that both the entire extended family keeps OP and her husband banned and away from them.", "The husband is being a bully not a jokester", "Of course it is not in the right place, he is a psycho.", "The thing is, what Mike finds funny about this is the hurt and anguish he causes in other people like the fucking antisocial asshole he is. \n\nI believe he also does this to OP and OP is desperately afraid to step out of line or else she becomes the butt of his \"jokes\".", "'Hey it's just a joke' is not a get-out from everything. No-one is obliged to find something funny just because you do and to insist that they should is bullying, no more, no less. Mike's 'jokes' are unpleasant and not remotely funny, and I speak as someone with a very sick sense of humour indeed. He's an AH and OP is another one for enabling him.", "I got you", "Germany has one as well. \"Fremdscham\".", "Well you can't just say that and not tell us what it is!", "Same here. I have a few adoptees in my family, and this is something you don't joke about. It's so insensitive.", "Yeah, that wasn't even an attempt at a joke.   \n\n\n He enjoys \"getting them to react\" and to \"mess with them\". Mike really just likes to make other people unhappy by saying mean things.  \n\n\nMike gets joy from the misery of others.   \n\n\nhaha! Isn't it funny that he likes other people to be unhappy? So funnY.", "One of my favorite things in the world is to ask an AH in this situation to explain how the \"joke\" is funny and watch them have to either stumble or say out loud that they're racist/cruel/[insert AH trait here]. I used to be a professional chef and this worked so many times when someone made a joke relating to me being a woman in the kitchen. \ud83d\ude44", "my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 in Finnish."]}
