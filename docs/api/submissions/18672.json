I work from home.\n\nOn Monday night, I was home alone as she'd gone in for her shift. I thought it'd be kind of cute/romantic/funny, to go down there during her shift, something I've never done before\n\nSo, I go down there, I see her behind the bar, wait until her back is turned, and then I rush over there and grabbed a seat. \n\nShe turns around and sees me. There was no smile, no giggle, just an eye-roll and a \" What are you doing here?\"\n\nI joked that I was in town on business and needed a drink. She told me to go home and added, \" If you're here to flirt, I'm in no mood\".\n\nI asked if I could stay for a drink. She said \" No\" and insisted again that I go home.\n\nWhen she realized that others at the bar were confused, she let them know that I was her \" idiot husband\", which got some laughs.\n\nI figured this was going nowhere and went home.\n\nThe next morning she explained that it was really inconsiderate of me to show up while she's working.\n\nMy case was, I thought I was being romantic. She said I was being selfish\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685589713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x6ue6/aita_for_visiting_my_wife_at_work/", "score": 4293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you met her boss/coworkers?", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want you visiting at work, she could have expressed it more kindly rather that being openly disrespectful.", "NTA- idiot husband?  You sir have a wife problem, there is a difference between not wanting to be bothered at work (you weren\u2019t bothering her) and out right insulting you in public to your face.  Imagine what she is saying about you when you aren\u2019t there\u2026", "NTA. She works at a bar a public place. It\u2019s not like she works at some corporate office where you would be interrupting. You have every right to be there and I thought what you said was funny and cute. If she was slammed and not in the mood she should apologize for being so mean. Or she likes to flirt for bigger tips and she doesn\u2019t want you around for that.", "I think it depends, and asking how someone feels first is important. \n\nSurprising me at work and expecting me to wait on you would annoy me, people rarely tip their spouses for their efforts. That means expecting attention, service, etc for less than I'd get from someone else. \n\nBut, if you brought me coffee, food, or something similar and then left when I needed to get back to work I'd think that was super romantic and wonderful. \n\nI think every person is different, and that's something you'd have needed to talk to her about well before you did it.", "NTA.\n\nThis needs a talk out. Boundaries or not, \" idiot husband\" to patrons is not cool. My husband used to come to my place of work. If I was too busy I said , Hey I'm too busy I'll see you at home, love you. Don't let this disrespect just slide by without a talk. That's hurtful.", "NTA. \n\nSit down with her and ask her to elaborate on what happened. Bar work is extremely exhausting and she may have been having a very busy day - BUT that's still no excuse to publicly call you an idiot. To me, that's a relationship red flag.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s much of an AH either. You tried to be cute but she wasn\u2019t into it. She could have been a bit kinder to you about it. You obviously got your hopes up and your feelings hurt, which is completely valid but I don\u2019t think she really did anything wrong per se. She was busy at work and from the sounds of it, you may have crossed a boundary that you didn\u2019t know she had. Hopefully good communication will get you through it with no drama.", "On the surface you did nothing wrong - you just sat down at a bar. You didn't demand her attention, didn't bother and didn't got upset she served other customers. \n\nBut the fact you thought this was a romantic gesture, and the fact she had such a harsh reaction suggest there something else going on we're not aware of. I don't sure if it's on you or on her, so I'm marking this as not enough information.", "Okay Ross.\n\nThe reason it's selfish is because your attempt at being \"romantic\" was a demand for her attention while she was trying to do her job. What did you think *she* was going to get out of you showing up at her work? \n\nYTA and the next time you want to be romantic while she's at work, try cleaning the house or cooking something for her so she has a nice surprise when she gets home.", "NTA.\n\nWhat's the difference between you and another random customer?", "NTA - you wanted to surprise her at work. She was surprised. Now you know she didn\u2019t care for it. Say you are sorry your idea was a dud. However, when a newlywed rolls their eyes at their spouse and calls him an idiot there is a real problem. OP\u2019s mistake was well-intended. Spouse was unkind.", "Everyone's different, I get that, but I love it when my girlfriend comes to visit me at work. A friendly face that instantly makes me smile brightens up my shift! NTA. It was a really sweet gesture, and she could have been a little less rude about it. NTA.", "There's no way that you married a bar tender who lives down the street and never visited.", "NTA. I used to bartend. My Hubby came in. Friends came in. Its open to the public. They all knew, as anyone would, if I was busy that I couldn't spend as much time with them. I sure never berated them or belittled them for coming in. She was rude and condescending", "I served and bartended for 10 years, and I was always THRILLED when my partner came in. It made my entire shift.\n\nFor reference, my ex-husband came in to my place of work exactly twice in 8 years.\n\nCurrent partner came in 5 or 6 times in 8 months, and I loved it! I felt seen, and it was a way to spend time together when our schedules didn't align.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I served/bartended for a long time.  I was always glad to see and serve my S/O.  She was at least understanding if it was busy and food or drinks took at bit.", "Bartenders live off tips, how you get tips is being friendly/ flirty.  Some wear low shirts, some take off their ring. Can't be too flirty when your husband is there, leading to lower tips.\n\nPlus you don't know if she had some creep say something that ruined her day, and just did not want to hear anything remotely reminding. May just been a bad time!", "NTA she is. Her not wanting you there is weird but not the bad part. It\u2019s how she responded.", "NTA. Something smells off here. I could not imagine ever referring to my partner as an idiot in private, let alone in public. Maybe it\u2019s time to see a counsellor to dig deeper into what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. If my husband called me an idiot in front of others, or really, at all, he'd regret it. In my book, name-calling is never okay. In 20 years, we've NEVER called each other names. Except our sweet names for each other.\nWe used to work in the same building. He was IT and I was call center. Both really busy, but when we would see each other, we always had kind words. We'd even flirt in the parking lot. \nI don't get her issue. All she had to say was \"now isn't a great time babe.\" She chose to be unkind. Not okay. Also, if she's frowning at the sight of you...I don't know man. Not a good sign.", "Honestly NTA, mainly because of her job. She\u2019s a bartender, her job is to serve drinks and there\u2019s no way she doesn\u2019t have regular conversations with people who sit at the bar. You didn\u2019t demand her attention you simply showed up and said one sentence and all she did was blow you off and made fun of you in front of other people. What if you went to simply get a drink? Is she going to tell you that you can\u2019t step into her place of work at all just because she works there? She said she wasn\u2019t in the mood to flirt, so you immediately stopped. You preceded to ask for a drink and she refused, but her job is to serve people drinks when they ask. Now if you had continued to try and flirt with her I would\u2019ve said Y-T-A, but you didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like she works in a corporate office building and you showed up and walked in on a meeting. Are you now not supposed to go eat or drink anywhere where you know someone who works there? Or are you supposed to message those people every time? \n\nEdit: Even if she was busy, she could\u2019ve communicated that in a better way. There\u2019s no reason for her to insult you like that.", "So, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but I think you may have some misconceptions about what it is to work in a bar. There\u2019s a pretty heavy facade you have to wear when your job is dependant on serving the public.\n\nI could give you a long and serious tutorial on it, but Reddit me prefers to laugh and George Castanza said it best when he explained that there is \u201cfriend George\u201d \u201cwork George\u201d and \u201crelationship George\u201d and the worlds can never collide, because a George divided against himself cannot stand! Look it up on the tube thing", "NTA. You had a kind thought, apparently it offended her. Apologize for that, but let her know calling you an idiot is not alright.", "NTA. \n\nI'd be thrilled if my partner came to my work just to say hi.", "Nta. Okay maybe she didn\u2019t want to be bothered or something, maybe it was a rush time, but there is a way to say everything. She could have said \"aww that\u2019s sweet but it\u2019s pretty busy at the moment\" or something like that. Straight up rejection and humiliation in front of coworkers and customers is very weird. Id be very offended if I was you", "NAH\u2014 I work in service and have always loved when my husband, close friends, or family have dropped in. Of course they always know they won\u2019t have 100% of my attention since I\u2019m working, but it\u2019s always a nice surprise. My coworkers have always seemed to enjoy the same.\n\nI think your wife was caught off guard since this isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve done before\u2014 and maybe she doesn\u2019t like being visited at work. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a boundary she should communicate. Either way there seems to be some wires crossed communication wise.", "You're not the asshole. Her reaction was odd. And if I referred to my husband as \"my idiot husband,\" I'd be preparing for a divorce.", "NTA. Unless something is missing from this story, it sounds like all you did was sit down at the bar and she immediately started acting mean to you. The joke was kind of dumb, but she was already being mean. What the heck?", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, that sounds horrible. She needs a reality check.", "it was rude of her to roll her eyes at you and refer to you as \u2018 my idiot husband \u2018\n\nBut perhaps with you there she can\u2019t do her work as efficiently as she may feel as though she is going to be judged or distracted by you. Or what I\u2019m thinking is that he views her work as her alone time. Everyone needs alone time and perhaps you turning up unannounced interrupting her alone time made her upset. \n\nEither way I don\u2019t think any of you are in asshole territory just have a discussion about boundary\u2019s regarding that area", "Well IMO it was a really romantic interaction. If my wife visited me like that at my job I would totally blush and showed her off to everyone around me. I'd be winking at her and sending her flirty notes on the napkins and shit. The eyerolling was disrespectful.\n\nDo you constantly have fights about her line of work? if you do maybe there was a reason for her to be like that. If not, she was sus. Calling you an idiot was WAAAAAAY OUT OF LINE. \n\nJust so everyone knows, Mark did had a thing for Rachel. Ross was fucking right.", "NTA. She could have said \"Nice to see you but I'm busy, maybe it's best if you go home\" or something along those lines. Instead she decided to treat you like shit.\n\nEdit: just fyi I would love if my partner did something like this, especially the stranger flirting role play thing, I think it's funny and hot.", "NTA. Rather insulting for her to put you down in front of strangers. \n\nShe works in a public facing place. Unless you were disruptive and taking up too much of her time there is nothing wrong with what you did.", "NTA, her reaction was quite hostile.\n\nmaybe she didn't want to \"serve\" you or feel subservient... but I think you have a right to feel hurt about it.\n\nAsk how how she reacts to her friends coming into the bar and serving them?\n\nCould be insecurity.", "I love it and think you\u2019re witty comeback was cute.\n\nBut having a DH at the bar might ruin tips, she might feel weird, etc etc\n\nShe could have handled it better, & appreciated the support a little more", "NAH. As a former bartender I\u2019m going to give you some possible reasons: \n\nYou probably don\u2019t know this, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m going with NAH, but Most bars have a no significant other while working rule. It\u2019s to keep jealousy at people flirting with their staff from causing bar fights. So that could be reason 1. She could get in trouble for you being there. \n\nReason 2, it\u2019s very distracting bc you feel like you have to constantly pay attention to said SO yet you\u2019re trying to work.\n\nReason 3 that ties into reason 2, it\u2019s a distraction that could cost us a fine. \n\nShe was TA though for calling you an idiot. Not cool and it\u2019s HER fault not yours for not explaining you shouldn\u2019t go to her work. So please don\u2019t feel bad for trying to be sweet.", "NTA, if this is the first time you've tried to be nice and surprise her and didn't know she didn't want you to come, she WAY overreacted and I'm wondering why.\ud83e\udd14 Is there someone at the bar she doesn't want you to see?  No need to be rude and belittle you by calling you the idiot husband when a quick kiss and a \"Thanks for coming to see me, but we're swamped right now\"", "Reading through all these YTA comments I'm sure that if the script was flipped and a husband did that to his wife you guys would be telling the wife that it was suspicious and demeaning and to get a divorce.", "NTA... I dont get it. My bf, then husband would come in to eat when I worked in a restaurant.  He understood if I was busy he couldn't chat much with me. He didnt visit too often when I worked in dental office but he would bring the staff treats for the staff room.", "NTA. i would LOVE if my husband came down to my job to surprise me. even if i\u2019m busy, i love seeing him and i could totally take a minute to go say hi and give him a hug and kiss. your wife was pretty rude. if she didn\u2019t want you there, she could\u2019ve said that it was a bad time and to go home. instead she called you an idiot and got some cheap laughs from a few drunks", "NTA at all. I would personally love my BF to show up where I work. It's a sweet gesture.", "NTA..but maybe she just needed a break from you? You did say that you work from home yes you ARE newlyweds but still....maybe she just needed to not see you for a few hours so dont take it personal", "She's working. She's busy. She undoubtedly knows you pretty well, and knows you intended to flirt with her.\n\nIn a busy workplace, flirting and other romantic gestures are distracting. It might have been OK if you'd given her a heads-up that you were thinking of dropping in on nights when you're alone, and she'd agreed to it. But you took her by surprise, and an unwelcome surprise at that.\n\nYTA.", "I would say NTA. \nI physically can\u2019t help but smile when I see someone I\u2019m close to come into my workplace, be it family/friends or a partner (I work in customer service so there were always plenty of staff and customers around, though I\u2019m sure a bar would be a different vibe). The only time I didn\u2019t smile or feel happy to see a partner come in to my workplace was the moment I realised I didn\u2019t want to be in the relationship anymore.\n\nHer rolling her eyes upon seeing you doesn\u2019t bode well. However, if she feels like her being at work is the only place she can get space from you and the relationship then I would understand the reaction.\n\nIt\u2019s best to use this opportunity to talk about your relationship and what each others boundaries are.\n\nGood luck", "'Idiot husband' is a horrible thing to say, I've never said that in our worst fights.   Even if you misjudged the showing up at work thing, she could easily have informed you without insults \"thanks for thinking of me honey but I'm busy/stressed/just need to focus on my job right now\".   \n\nI find it incredible that calling your life partner an idiot, in any circumstance, is acceptable to so many people. It's really sad.  OP you don't have to be with someone who calls you names.  \n\nI suspect she has some major resentments toward you, as her reaction seems far stronger and more negative than this single situatiin calls for...  - it could be that she's just not a nice person, (in which case maybe reconsider if you want to be treated this way the rest of your life) - or it could be that you've been overly demanding of her or selfish in someway before this & this was the moment she finally blew up - there's no way for us to know your relationship dynamic.  If you're not sure, maybe get some outside perspective from a therapist.", "NTA, idk if the people who are saying YTA have ever been to a bar but you constantly see bar tenders talking to their partners and friends for a minute or two. Literally some have their partners at the bar weekly. They still get their job done but can be friendly and socialize during slow moments. This is the first time you\u2019ve ever gone to her work and that\u2019s how she treats you? That\u2019s whack as hell.", "YTA. Don\u2019t expect to show up to someone\u2019s work and have them be happy to see you. She\u2019s working, she\u2019s busy, she doesn\u2019t have time to entertain you or being loving or whatever else you wanted from her. You\u2019re taking away a tipping seat at her bar and from paying attention to other customers as you obviously wanted her attention. Find a friend or a hobby for when your bored that is not your wife\u2019s work. I doubt you\u2019d love being interrupted in the middle of your work day because she was bored, don\u2019t do it to her", "YTA, people in the service industry can get fired for having family members, partners & friends hang out with them at work. \nIt never makes them look good. \n\nDefinitely would have check in with wife to make sure it was ok to do so. That is called respect", "I understand you motivation but I also wonder if you know her well enough to be married, why didn\u2019t you know not to bother her at work?\nWhy did you expect her to giggle? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t bring your partner to work day.\nIt kind of feels like you don\u2019t respect her since you thought it was ok to surprise her while she was working.\n\n\nIf you needed to get out of the house, and you really wanted to visit her at work, ask first, and don\u2019t try and make a game out of your sudden appearance. She isn\u2019t there for your entertainment.\nSorry but ( said as Jake Peralta) YTAH", "NTA. Your wife is a dick, doesn't respect you, and based on what you tell us, you weren't being inappropriate or awkward. You simply wanted to surprise her and she was a total asshole to you and on top of all, she called you an idiot and embarrassed you in front of others. Then, she proceeds to victimize herself and calls you inconsiderate and selfish? \n\nThe fact she was so clearly irritated by your mere presence raises suspicion.", "Hey I'm gonna go with NAH- you had good and cute intentions, and your wife isn't an AH either just for not wanting you to visit while she's on the clock. \n\nI can understand that being in a customer-facing role, having people you know drop by can seriously throw you off. I've also had instances where having those visits really brightens up my day! It's just gonna vary from person to person and couple to couple. Sometimes you're gonna miss the mark but now you both know a bit more about each other and what kind of gestures are appreciated. Kiss and make up :P", "She's the AH.", "Bartenders have to be fully \"on\" for customers. You showing up likely throws her off her game and affects her performance. Thus affecting tips.", "NTA\n\nTotally flummoxed by your wife's reaction.\n\nIt's surprising.", "I used to bartend and would literally post that I'm working to come visit me. \nEspecially my partners, come and hang! I loved it. If it got super busy they could see I was and leave me alone. Her reaction was totally uncalled for. \nNta.", "Puppy dog behavior.  Following her.  I would not like it.", "ESH\n\nShe probably has a different version of herself and you while at work and you showing up unannounced messed her up.\n\nYou can do romantic stuff at home etc and not in her place of work - you wouldn't arrive at her work place if it was an office?\n\nAnd she should not have been as rude as she was.", "NTA. Damn, that was a strong reaction from her. Do you follow her around like a lost puppy at home and bother the shit out of her or something? I can't think of why she'd be so angry to see you. Maybe she just really likes to keep her home and work life separate.", "NTA. \n\nMy guess is that her regulars don\u2019t know she\u2019s married as she flirts with guys to get better tips. She was irritated to see you because you threw her off her game and she couldn\u2019t just flirt with everyone for better tips. Or maybe they knew she\u2019s married but she still piled on the charm in order to get better tips. With you there, she can\u2019t behave that way. I say this as someone who was a server for years. I never got upset when family or friends would come in because they were just more paying customers. I didn\u2019t have to change my behavior in front of them because I was professional and treated everyone the same.", "You thought you were being cute but you were just creating more work for her. I\u2019m an accountant and if my partner showed up at my office with a stack of papers asking me to file his tax return to be romantic, I would not be amused.\n\nEdit: YTA", "NTA. I thought what you said was cute. Even if she was uncomfortable with you being there she could've handled it better.  Is she like this often?", "YTA. She's at work. That's a very inappropriate place for you to be romantic. As an office worker, if my partner showed up and thought they were entitled to my attention while I was trying to do my job...I don't really know how that would work out, but we wouldn't be together anymore.", "Okay, as a bartender, I\u2019m going to go with NTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re showing up every night and sitting at her bar getting sloshed for hours?  You would be Y T A.\n\nMy regulars know I\u2019m in a committed relationship and on the rare occasions my boo comes in, they all shoot the sh*t and have fun lol.  Something bf seems off.", "nta, it doesn\u2019t seem like you were disrupting her work at all and she was extremely rude. I can\u2019t imagine telling my partner to leave and calling them an idiot even if I wasnt having a good day. If she has a problem with you showing up at her workplace, she needs to communicate with you, not insult you. She owes you an apology for how rude and disrespectful she was. What kind of person talks about their spouse like that?", "Absolutely NTA!\n\nI work in an organization. They have rules and regulations but they are not stingy about it. My partner still comes and surprises me at work and it makes my day no matter how worse it was initially. He\u2019d call me and ask me what I am up to and then tell me he\u2019s downstairs. I skip so many stairs on my way, I might break a bone someday. It doesn\u2019t matter to us if we just get 15 mins with each other. I cannot imagine reacting the way OP\u2019s wife did, especially if I were working as a bartender. OP went, took a seat, asked if he could have a drink, and she REFUSED? LIKE IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE SEEN AS A WIFE, AT LEAST DO YOUR PART OF THE JOB? The reaction she gave was cold and uncalled for imo. And to call him IDIOT in front of a bunch of strangers who are your customers? Wow. She\u2019s definitely TA. You\u2019re a great husband. Your wife\u2019s the stupid one.", "ESH. \n\nRomantic? Stopping by my busy workplace and you aren\u2019t there to bring me flowers or food, but instead want me to serve you a drink. Yes, it\u2019s the job in this instance, but I wouldn\u2019t want to serve someone *at work* that I can\u2019t make money off of (tips). If you\u2019re my husband, I\u2019m basically waiting on you for free and I\u2019m at work to *make money*. I probably don\u2019t even like waiting on you at home because it feels too much like the 1950s.\n\n\u201cIdiot husband\u201d is something I don\u2019t think I would say in front of others, but probably would if I was at my limit that day. Not cool overall. Everyone could do better here.", "NTA, however you should have listened to her the first time she asked you to leave. This is probably why she frustratedly called you \u2018my idiot husband\u2019.", "NTA, she probably got upset because the regular flirters would tip less for preferential treatment if her SO was there. Major red flag.", "NTA, you'd think she'd at least be happy to see you a little bit. It's not like you were demanding attention from her... I thought it was cute and I'd be happy to see my SO at work as long as they're not expecting my undivided attention or anything", "NTA. He clearly has no respect for you and is verbally abusing you and allowing his friend to do the same. There are other guys who will treat you better.", "NTA. I used to bartend and I loved it when my friends / boyfriend would come in. Her reaction is weird to me.", "She's the asshole. Lesson learned though I hope.", "NTA my wife used to bartend and she'd beg me to come out there even if it was super busy", "NTA. \n\nShe probably could have been nicer about it, but I lean towards NAH. Spouses at work can be distracting. \n\nYou think it\u2019s romantic. She now has an extra amount of stress at work trying to balance working with interacting with her husband.", "Being romantic has no place at work. She is rushed off her feet all evening.

I am so confused as to why Y T A is apparently the most popular opinion here.\n\nWhat the fuck. He just sat down and apparently he is \"demanding her attention\"? He did nothing to warrant rolling eyes, being dismissive and calling him an \"idiot husband\". I can understand that his presence might break her flow or just not feel right, but that is not the way to react.", "Happy Cake Day. (And I agree with you.)", "If the genders were reversed, most people in this sub would call the man every anti-male insult they could think of and getting OP to get divorce papers ready.\n\nThe more I see posts like this in this sub, the more I think there's a quickly increasing number of people that just hate men.", "YTA because let me invent a scenario about how you will use that $1000 to set her up for tax fraud.", "Exactly. If she has to hide it from him she shouldn\u2019t be doing it at all.", "It would be 'he's abusive, get therapy, get divorced'.", "That's really not how boundaries are asserted, it's just being passive aggressive.", "Same. I worked as a line cook for a bit and my boyfriend worked for door dash and I absolutely loved it when he came by. Even if we were crazy busy and I had no time to talk, it would be great just to catch a glimpse of him through the window. It was honestly energizing. I\u2019m really confused about her reaction here tbh. I get being busy but what\u2019s so hard about telling him that and politely asking him to go if it\u2019s too distracting?", "Yeah if she didn\u2019t start with an apology the very second she saw the husband it\u2019s clear this wasn\u2019t a joke of some sort", "It's probably a ploy to get bigger tips. If she \"seems available\" to men, especially regulars, she can play off their fantasies to get them to buy more drinks or get bigger tips directly. If she's seen as in a happy, healthy, committed relationship, the regulars \"don't have a shot\". That said, definitely not an excuse to treat her husband that way and she should know this was a possibility at some point and communicated ahead of time or had an alternative method to deal with it than to dismiss him and then insult him.", "While I agree it would be more severe if the genders were swapped, I think it's a sign of progress that the top comments all agree OP is NTA!", "This is the underrated comment. I\u2019d never publicly demean my wife.  I\u2019d rather make myself look foolish and deflect some bad attention from her than make her look stupid.", "This. I don't name call my husband unless we're both joking. If I'm angry, we talk about it.", "Sometimes?", "He said for no reason, on this sub WE give an opinion based on reasons.", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone is defending wife, and they have a point, but completely insulting him in front of people isn't something you do to someone you love.", "Im also a bartender & I LOVE when my bf stops by \ud83d\ude0f makes me happy to see him across the bar. Plus I'll have someone to talk to that i actually want to talk to", "Ya but how the fuck they supposed to know that?  He took a shot and it sounds like you were an A back.  Just like this abovile comment", "Sounds like you suck lol", "As a bartender I really enjoy when my husband shows up or some friends coming by. Most times they bring me snacks or coffee.  And I feel much safer cis I work alone and til 5 in the morning.", "Your work is your work. You serve drinks. You aren't a rocket scientist. If you fuck up, no lives are lost. Who cares if it throws you off your game?", "I was a bartender for 10 years in some pretty busy/well known spots\u2026 and I loved when my boyfriend would come in. I\u2019d also tell all my friends my shifts so they\u2019d come see me. So, guess it just depends on the person", "Did you tell other customers that she was your idiot girlfriend?", "But do u roll your eyes and yell to your coworkers that your idiot husband showed up to surprise you? If u do ur husband needs to run", ">I just looked at him and told him to get out. I love him to pieces\n\nThose things just don't seem to go together. Politely saying you've very busy and you'll catch up later, sure. I wouldn't even tell an acquaintance to just get out.", "yeah this isnt what happened did you read the post ? or is monday night before 9pm normally slammed ?", "My guy he ordered a drink at a bar. That is what you do at bars. He didn\u2019t walk up to the counter and demand she take 5 minutes so they could have small talk", "Then the bar would be closed because any patron would be \"demanding\" (as you put it) the same attention, and if the staff is just as hostile to those patrons, that's bad for business.", "The \"OK Ross\" comment really sets the tone.\n\nIt's not even remotely comparable to say OP turning up to a public bar to get a drink from his wife is the same as a character explicitly being told they were too busy to see their partner today and that partner turning up to a private office with a picnic and proceeding to entirely ignore how busy and stressed they were.", "If the genders were switched everyone would be calling for divorce.  Honestly I'm pretty sure this is headed for divorce anyway... contempt is a huge indicator of the impending end.", "I am so glad I know women in real life. I'm so grateful for the knowledge that most women are not like the ones on reddit who are calling this man an asshole for just... visiting his wife at work, or suggesting that his presence prevents her from flirting with other men and that makes *him* shitty.", "Or, you know, aggressive aggressive.", "What's the passive part?", "When I was working part-time as a student in a small caf\u00e9, my parents would occasionally drop by to visit. The difference is they'll usually tell me ahead, like before I leave for my shift they say they'll be nearby running errands later and ask if they can drop by for coffee and cake break. So I didn't mind since I would know to expect them at least.\n\nBut yeah, chasing him out and then calling him an idiot in front of customers is very rude of her. I would have just served him and then quietly let him know that I appreciate the gesture but I'm rather busy and would rather focus on work.", "I can 100% understand this, I like to keep home and work life as seperate as possible and any intermingling of the two just adds stress, its hard enough to switch off afterwork even without home comming to work or work stuff comming home.", "I'm always shocked at how Reddit reacts to husbands on AITA.  \"You should've known better and definitely deserved to be called an idiot and heckled by the other customers.\"  My ass, there's an appropriate way to handle this.  If my wife showed up on a job site and I called her an \"idiot\" for showing up, my coworkers would mos def be like bro chill, she was trying to be nice.\n\nAnd I guarantee if the genders were reversed in this situation there'd be more defense towards the visiting party.  But, ya know, it is reddit.", "I appreciate this take, solidified my NTA", "Hopefully \"soon-to-be-former bartender and single\". What if he works from home? Her reaction gives him the right to say, \"Go out. You're bothering me.\"", "Bunch of toxic females up in here bruh", "I kinda think they\u2019re both ass holes for getting married at (or before) 23. I didn\u2019t know *shit* when I was 23. I mean, I barely do now at 35\u2026 Something I do know, though, is that any of my friends who got married young also got divorced young.", "Her not actually saying he can't visit the bar. It's like she's stamped on his toes when he walked in, but hasn't actually said he can't come in. Passive aggressive.", "also makes sense if the husband is excessively clingy and she's tired of it.", "Or behind his back...", "oh absolutely. reverse the genders, and this thread would be full of \"he's cheating on you at his job!\" \"he doesn't want you to see him flirt with his hot coworkers/customers!\" \"he called you an idiot! doesnt matter what you did first, this is abuse!\"", "I usually hate the \"if the genders where swapped\" argument but in this case you're absolutely right. If OP was a woman and said that she went to see her husband at work and he called her his \"idiot wife\"to everyone and everyone laughed, reddit would be telling her to break up immediately.", "No. Me and plenty others like are not thrown off by that at all. There are enough comments in this thread in opposition to your view that you definitely should not be using such blanket terms as anyone. The majority of bartenders I have known have always enjoyed their spouses showing up at there work. The only ones who didn't were in abusive relationships. \n\nBasically this scenario is different for many people. OP's wife handled in a horrible way though. Insulting your spouse just to get some laughs from people is not a healthy way to treat them.", "Man, while I absolutely agree OP is NTA, I didn't even consider your other point. Good call, and you are without a doubt absolutely right. Pretty double standardy sexist society we live in.\n\nThe fact that she so freely down talked him like that in front of her co-workers the first time he ever met them is also really disrespectful, and makes me wonder how she talks about him when he's not around.", "She specifically denied him a drink, insisted that he left and went home, and called him her idiot husband. That's pretty freaking aggresive. There was no passiveness", "This", "Like a week ago, there was a guy who called his wife an idiot and people  \n were falling all over themselves to say it was no big deal because he   \nwas obviously just teasing.", "No she was letting someone special know that this  is her husband, and encourage the belief that he is a fool!", "Amen to this.", "Yeah this shit is what happens when tip culture is accepted. Servers and bartenders make a few dollars an hour and the tips are how they ACTUALLY feed themselves. So you gotta work the room and schmooze the customers for their sweet sweet cash. It's disgusting."]}
