I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for saying this, but people who act as though their pets are their children are so incredibly annoying. Your pet will be fine without you for a few days. \n\nYour sister-in-law can either find a dog-sitter or not come on the trip. She's the one being selfish by insisting she bring her dog, when she knows that you're allergic.", "NTA. I love my dogs, but I would never expect them to be included in a vacation.", "NTA.

Note how I said \"or\" and not \"and\". Either one would be more than enough for it to not be an option. If the SIL was legally blind and it was her helper dog there could be something to consider but it doesn't sound like it. If she knew about either of those she shouldn't even be asking.\n\nI am a dog owner and very attached to my dog. I'll let her on the furniture and she sleeps under my covers. I wouldn't ever think of taking her some place she can't go or bring her around someone who is allergic. Honestly the only kind of vacation I'd think of taking her on would be something outdoorsy with no plans to go out to eat and even then maybe not. It can be a real pain to take a pet traveling and limits what you can do if you want to be a responsible pet owner and considerate of others.", "NTA.

The cabin is not pet-friendly, by which I assume you mean pets are not allowed. The last point should be enough by itself, but add in the allergy, and it's clear the dog should stay elsewhere.", "NTA a dog can\u2019t be there because of your allergies, therefore I\u2019d consider it to be a dog-free vacation. Somewhat similarly, if you were to plan a group child-free vacation and someone insisted that they bring their kids, it\u2019s just another sort of incompatibility.

Those invited can just decline if there\u2019s incompatibility.\n\nAs much as I love animals there\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to bring one to a vacation where they\u2019d cause a health problem for someone.", "NTA and there's pretty much 0 wiggle room for SiL since the rental doesn't allow pets.  Who is responsible for the payment on that?  Strike 1.\n\nStrike 2 for SiL is not caring that one of the other guests expressed a concern about said dog.  A legit health/quality of life concern.\n\nStrike 3 is equating a pet with a child.  Not saying folks don't/can't love pets but it isn't even remotely the same thing.  Not even close.

The dogs fought with neighbor's dogs. One dog got onto the food table and tipped it. After that lovely party, I banned dogs and believe me, I took shit for the next five years. Solution was to stop inviting those that came with dogs after I asked and then told them not to, and to write NO DOGS on the invitation, adding that if people showed up with them, I was sorry to say they had to leave.\n\nFamily members still do not understand why they can't bring \"their babies\". smh. OP, definitely not the asshole!!", "The cabin is not pet friendly, end of story.", "I love my dog, I bring him on vacation with me. However, that's because I plan, pay for and find dog friendly places. If im invited on vacation and he isn't welcome or it's not a pet friendly location then I have a choice to make, let me repeat that, I have a choice to make. It's her choice to come or not or to find a place close by and pay for it as well as the pet deposit. (And I am one of those people who treats their pet like a child!)\nNTA", "Here, have an upvote, you wonderfully reasonable hooman with the rare common sense gene!!", "I'm very much a dog person but in situations like OP's vacation, I pay to have my dogs boarded in a very nice pet hotel where they will spend the whole time being spoiled by the staff. \n\nNTA, OP. Your SIL is being selfish.", "To be honest, most kids will be fine without for a few days too, obviously not unattended depending on age, but a pet wouldn't be left unattended completely for 3 days either. \n\nThat said OP us still NTA, they are allergic AND the venue isn't dog friendly, either one of these points makes the SIL an AH, both together just multiplies it.", "I love my puppy! He comes to lots of places with me. They are all pet friendly homes or places and they know him! And no one has allergies. Plus he doesn\u2019t shed so he wouldn\u2019t cause allergies. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t go anywhere where I\u2019m drinking, I\u2019m holidaying, he isn\u2019t welcome or someone doesn\u2019t like dogs. \n\nBecause he is a dog and he can stay home with his brother cat and a neighbour will watch him and walk him!", "Meh, I consider my dogs to be my children and they are incredibly spoiled but I can go on vacation without them.  Not all pet lovers are unreasonable.", "Depends on how much they act like their animal is their child. Occasionally saying their pet is their baby is fine. Comparing it to a parent\u2019s struggles is not.", "I agree with you! I love my dog, she's my furry sidekick and I love her to bits. She even trained herself to gently wake me up when I start to have a nightmare from PTSD, and I'm blown away with how smart she is!\n\nThat said, my pup does not take priority over another person's health. If I'm going on a family vacation to a place where taking her is an issue, then she stays with my friend. She gets a fun pup-cation with her furry pal and my friend. I get to spend time with people I love. \n\nSIL prioritizing taking the dog over OP being able to enjoy the vacation AND putting the no pet rental reservation at risk is just selfish.", "Even though I\u2019d rather spend time with my dogs than 99.9% of people, this is the answer.", "We have a dog (can\u2019t have kids) who we treat like an absolute prince. I truly love him so much. We do have to think twice about overnight engagements, but that\u2019s because we can\u2019t find a boarding place that\u2019s not trash. Maybe that\u2019s the issue here? \n\nI understand not wanting a dog around if OP has allergies, that would suck. SIL may just not be able to attend or find a cabin that is dog friendly. That\u2019s a big issue, like if the rental property doesn\u2019t allow dogs\u2026 either she can\u2019t bring her dog or she can\u2019t go. End of story.", "Former boarding school kid here agrees. Great school but.....", "My cousin in the UK sent his kids to a \"children's hotel\" when his MIL visited.  He was going to do the same when his parents ts visited but they said no - we're  here to see the kids.", "You house-train it and crate-train it.  A smart dog can pick it up in a few days and a dumb dog doesn't want to mess its crates and so waits to get taken outside.\n\nIf you don't take the pup out often enough... then you're the cause of the problem (you in the generic sense, not personal).", "Yep.", "Similes and metaphors are figures of speach.  People use them all the time. \n\nPeople say their pets are like their kids because it helps convey the depth of their feelings for them that saying \"this is my dog\" doesn't.  Similes and metaphors are literally made to help people do this.\n\nI don't understand why people have an issue with this.    People who say that are generally well aware that their pet isn't a human child.\n\nI get having an issue with people who expect others to treat their animals like actual kids - like people who want \"pawternity leave\" or expect people to invite their dogs to parties or whatever.\n\nBut I don't get why people get so bent out of shape over a figure of speach?  Like do those same people get upset when a lawyer is described as a shark?  Or when a hardworker is described as a workhorse or a machine?", "No, what they mean by \"my pets are my kids\" is \"I believe that my pets are as important as kids, require as much love and attention as kids, and the experience of being a pet parent is extremely similar to the experience of being a human parent.\" It's not the same. \n\nBut also, people leave puppies at home. It's not the same.", "My Cats are my Children. They are as important to Me as if they were human and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe issue would be if I forced other people around me to view them like that and/or forced my cats down their throats.\n\nI'm autistic snd struggle to connect with people, connecting with animals is far greater to me.", "Maybe the occasional fanatic.\n\nBut in my experience literally none of the people who referred to their pets as their kids meant what you just said.\n\nAnd no one said it was the same.  I was just pointing out your logic was flawed.  I don't know anyone who would argue that pets and human children are exactly the same."]}
