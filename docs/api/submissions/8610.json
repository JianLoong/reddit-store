She is seeing a doctor about it, however the doctor said it is hard to treat as it is her body's response back when she had an eating disorder (before we started dating). In general this condition is manageable and she always has snacks with her if she feels hungry and both of us make sure that they are always available (a lot of these snacks are healthy, like dried peas, meat chips, fruits, etc).\n\nLast weekend my sister invited us and the rest of the family for breakfast as she had some news to announce (she lives in a country house quite a distance away from the shops) . She has also asked me and Ann not to bring any snacks since she felt it was disrespectful and caused trouble with her kids. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a medical condition and can't go hungry, to which my sister assured us there will be food when we arrive and it will be ready to eat. Last time it wasn't the case and the food wasn't ready until 4 hours after which is why Ann had to snack on her dried fruits.\n\nWe agreed and arrived in the morning as promised to help my sister. Ann had some fruits for breakfast and coffee. There was no food available but plenty of snacks like nuts, cheese and fruits, so when Ann got hungry and as she didn't have any snacks and the hot food was not ready, she asked my sister if she can snack on the cold food. My sister was not happy about it and started shouting at Ann calling her childish for wanting to eat and she can wait for the hot food since her kids are patiently waiting. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a condition and can not go long times without food, but my sister refused to budge. As my car was blocked by my BIL car due to tight parking, I have asked him to move, so we can go to the shop and get something, but my sister said no as she needs my BIL around to help around and we can just wait till the food is ready. Unfortunately this delay caused Ann to get sick so we had to leave soon after the food was ready, as she wasn't feeling well and carried on throwing up.\n\nMy sister told me that we behaved like an entitled assholes and ruined her announcement, and that Ann was clearly being sick for attention since she wasn't getting any that day. I have reminded her again about Ann's condition, what she said earlier about food being available and said she behaved spoiled and her actions were harsh towards Ann, she should have just let her snack, so she will not be seeing me or her around until she apologies.

NTA and I don't think I'd be seeing your sister for a looooong time, she isn't a good person.", "NTA.  Your sister is nuts, getting offended over a person needing a snack.", "NTA. Your sister is the A H and also a horrible host\u2014what kind of numbnut doesn\u2019t feed guests until 4 hours after they\u2019ve arrived? If I have guests they\u2019re getting offered a drink and a snack in the first 10-15 minutes after they\u2019ve settled in.\n\nAlso I bet your niblings also already have food issues because their mother is a controlling tyrant about it. She sounds toxic and exhausting.", "NTA \n\nYour sister is a fucking bully", "NTA.  \nRegardless of your sister's beliefs, facts don't care about her feelings.  \nIf your gf needs munchies for a medical condition, bring them.", "NTA. I\u2019d be telling those that contact you Exactly what happened and how your sister called your gf\u2019s diagnosis for \u2018childish\u2019 and \u2018attention seeking\u2019 and ignored her very real and acute need even going so far as to trapping you there by refusing to move the car blocking you in. \n\nYour sister is the childish attention seeker here. Must be why those words came so naturally to her: they Are her.", "NTA\n\nAnn has a medical condition requiring her to snack. Her snacks are essentially her medicine. Tell your sister to stay out of Ann's medicine. Ann is not bringing food with her. She has her medical prescription.", "NTA. I would love to know what meat chips are though", "NTA.\n\nSame problem and same reason. Your sister can gently f* off. \n\nMy grandpa was diabetic so I\u2019m using his same way even if the problem is different.  I would advise you to always pack snacks even if people ask you not to bring them, you are adults; she has a medical condition and you live in a democratic country. \n\nAlso make her doctor write a few lines about the condition if she has to eat something when she is out and someone start complaining.", "NTA. If your sister is actually a real person, I would try to stay away from her for like ever.", "I have a similar condition, Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome. I have a tiny window between \"oh I might be hungry\" to being SO hungry I can't hold down water. I have had this condition for years and yeah of anyone ever was like \"could you not eat rn\" I'd be like sure, but just know that this takes less time than me vomiting. Do you want to hold my hair back? It's literally a difference of MINUTES that can shift me into vomiting cycles. NTA.", "But also, strongly suggest you always carry \"emergency\" snack pack in the car or in your bag. There's no reason to literally be without food in easy reach. \n\nWhen traveling I always have Clif Bars or whatever so if I'm stranded somewhere I won't starve.", "Sister sounds like the kind of person who feeds peanut butter to someone with a peanut allergy to prove they are faking.", "No kidding. I don\u2019t vomit, but I get very cranky, shaky and generally uncomfortable if I don\u2019t eat when my body asks for it. It\u2019s literally better for everyone if I have a snack when I need it, I can\u2019t imagine telling another grown ass adult they can\u2019t manage their own body.", "I think her issues with snacks come from her kids wanting to eat Ann's snacks, finding them not tasty and throwing tantrums because they didn't like it. Or whatever they like they want to eat the whole pack and end up crying if Ann doesn't allow it and my sister thinks snack sharing spoils the appetite so they refuse to eat anything but sweets or crisps after.", "That's a lesson for the next time, wherever you go: take snacks with you regardless of what's promised. If necessary, eat them where others can't see you. \n\nRegarding how OP's sister is upset that her kids see it and want some... well, it's the responsibility of parents to explain, \"some people get really sick if they don't eat or drink in time, Ann is one of those people. She needs a snack, you don't.  Now go and play, dinner is ready in [x-amount of time]\". If they still nag about it, you need to wonder if it's the age or if they're spoiled brats.", "She absolutely does.", "Nah, diabetes doesn\u2019t exist. Everyone who claims to be diabetic is just doing it for attention /s", "Step up everybody let's play blood sugar roulette!!!", "lol right? if someone did that to me i wouldn\u2019t even bother going to the bathroom or a sink to puke. sister wants to fuck around and not let ann eat, she can find out what happens.", "Yep. I've lived in this body for nearly four decades. I know how it opperates. I know how to pilot it.\n\nAnyone who tells me when and what I can or can't put in it can fick right off.", "Oh, so she's just too lazy to parent her kids properly. Well, I probably wouldn't be going over to her place like, ever again, if she's willing to make your gf get sick out of her own laziness.", "Oh no...I forgot she had children. That's terrifying that she's responsible for living things.", "She's going to get karma bite her ass. Guess who gets sick on an empty stomach? 90% of pregnant women!", "They didn\u2019t need to bring it in the house. They could have been left in the car. Besides what if there was a traffic jam?  She should always have access to snacks if going without is an issue.", "But also, not that I am recommending this, no one can stop you from eating a snack in the bathroom or car.  It just seems practically impossible to prevent someone from having a snack.", "Oh they never would\u2026it would then be \u201clook at OP\u2019s gf being all dead for attention\u201d smh", "RIGHT!!! \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\u2026..I can\u2019t with you!!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "I have never before thought about this, but we all have a differing skill level in terms of accuracy while vomiting. But most of us will never know what it is.\n\nLike, there could be some olympic level accurate puker out there. The Annie Oakley of upchucking. But they would never know.", "Yeah, I think she thought and still thinks that Ann is faking her condition. How hard is it to tell her children that Ann has a health condition where she has to eat at certain times of the day. You don't have that so you can wait to eat.", "She probably was setting them up.  Op's sister sounds cruel", "Yeah like, you never smuggled food into a theater, or drugs/booze into a festie?", "\u2620\ufe0f", "A symptom some people with gastric sleeve surgery get is when their stomach is empty, they become super nauseous. I think it has something to do with stomach acids rising up into the esophagus more easily, but weirdly this sounds like a similar phenomenon", "I have this too and it sucks.  I always carry something with me.  Luckily my family aren't ignorant A-holes.", "I also get VIOLENTLY nauseated if I don't eat, especially in the mornings. I don't have a sleeve but I am in recovery for compulsive over-eating and have had intermittent bouts of GERD through my life."]}
