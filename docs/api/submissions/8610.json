She is seeing a doctor about it, however the doctor said it is hard to treat as it is her body's response back when she had an eating disorder (before we started dating). In general this condition is manageable and she always has snacks with her if she feels hungry and both of us make sure that they are always available (a lot of these snacks are healthy, like dried peas, meat chips, fruits, etc).\n\nLast weekend my sister invited us and the rest of the family for breakfast as she had some news to announce (she lives in a country house quite a distance away from the shops) . She has also asked me and Ann not to bring any snacks since she felt it was disrespectful and caused trouble with her kids. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a medical condition and can't go hungry, to which my sister assured us there will be food when we arrive and it will be ready to eat. Last time it wasn't the case and the food wasn't ready until 4 hours after which is why Ann had to snack on her dried fruits.\n\nWe agreed and arrived in the morning as promised to help my sister. Ann had some fruits for breakfast and coffee. There was no food available but plenty of snacks like nuts, cheese and fruits, so when Ann got hungry and as she didn't have any snacks and the hot food was not ready, she asked my sister if she can snack on the cold food. My sister was not happy about it and started shouting at Ann calling her childish for wanting to eat and she can wait for the hot food since her kids are patiently waiting. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a condition and can not go long times without food, but my sister refused to budge. As my car was blocked by my BIL car due to tight parking, I have asked him to move, so we can go to the shop and get something, but my sister said no as she needs my BIL around to help around and we can just wait till the food is ready. Unfortunately this delay caused Ann to get sick so we had to leave soon after the food was ready, as she wasn't feeling well and carried on throwing up.\n\nMy sister told me that we behaved like an entitled assholes and ruined her announcement, and that Ann was clearly being sick for attention since she wasn't getting any that day. I have reminded her again about Ann's condition, what she said earlier about food being available and said she behaved spoiled and her actions were harsh towards Ann, she should have just let her snack, so she will not be seeing me or her around until she apologies.

Your sister can gently f* off. \n\nMy grandpa was diabetic so I\u2019m using his same way even if the problem is different.  I would advise you to always pack snacks even if people ask you not to bring them, you are adults; she has a medical condition and you live in a democratic country. \n\nAlso make her doctor write a few lines about the condition if she has to eat something when she is out and someone start complaining.", "NTA.

I have had this condition for years and yeah of anyone ever was like \"could you not eat rn\" I'd be like sure, but just know that this takes less time than me vomiting.

NO meal or announcement justifies hostages.", "NTA. Keep your sister away from Ann. It sounds very much like she set all of this up to try to prove that Ann is lying about her medical condition.

Your sister is quite the ahole tho. Ann needs to bring snacks wherever she goes and your sister knowingly caused her to get sick.", "NTA. When I was pregnant, I was like this. Everyone knew, and that was that. If I got hungry or even ate the wrong thing- bad day. You can't promise that people will be accommodated and then not accommodate them. Regardless of the future with your sister, keep snacks in the car. So if need be she can go out to the car and eat there. She could take up a fake smoking habit. Lol. That's me.

And, she could have eaten them in the car so the kids couldnt see her. Her condition, is no different to other conditions like being a diabetic or severe allergic reactions.

It doesnt matter what SIL wants.", "Yall are adults. You are allowed to bring food with you anywhere. Keep a box or cooler in the car.

I hope her kids never get sick because they will be \"faking it for attention.\"  People like your sister make me sick!  I have a condition that is life long and people like her down play it like I am not that sick.  Okay, until you feel like I feel every day, then you can talk.   Tell her she owes you and your girlfriend an apology.  She did that to be spiteful.  I hope someone does that to her when she has a medical problem.  See how she likes it!", "NTA. Your sister is a massive AH. Ann is not a child being impatient, she has an actual, documented medical condition. I wouldn't go to your sister's again and I'd tell EVERYONE why when they ask.", "NTA. Next time just tell your missus to chunder on the fucking dining table and then you guys can leave.", "NTA - Holy shit your sister is a massive AH. Tell your BIL and any other family who will listen exactly what happened. I personally would go NC with your Sister also there was absolutely no need to deprive your girlfriend of food and it sounds like some stupid power play. Make sure to tell her directly that you don't give a shit  about her announcement too.", "NTA and she totally should have barfed directly onto your sister", "NTA your sister is", "What kind of miserable piece of trash is so controlling they won't let anyone eat when they're hungry?

I usually don't vomit though... my vision gets all chrystal or kaleidoscope like and I have to lay down or I drop.\n\nEdit: NTA OP", "I'm not a parent but I think the same applies to the children. I know children can be picky and quite frankly it can get annoying until they learn how to feed themselves properly, but damn woman, give your children _some_ snacks for the next thirty minutes or an hour until breakfast is ready. Manage their portions and they will still eat breakfast. OPs sister is a bad host, and in my opinion she's not the best parent either.", "This. I simply cannot understand just following her rules when you know full well it will make you violently sick. I would\u2019ve just snacked anyway.", "^^ Honestly this! Tell anyone that comes up to you or makes a snide remark.  About how this is a KNOWN medical condition she has, and that you e now learned to not trust anyone and always bring food in case. How your sister acted and couldn\u2019t compromise at all.  That she claimed food would be ready and it wasn\u2019t. But tell your BIL all of this. If your gf was diabetic and needed food, would they have the same issue? If they say \u201cthat\u2019s different\u201d then tell them it\u2019s really not in that this is a medical condition she has\u2026..not some fake thing for attention.  \n\nId imagine if you only said it to people who mention it to you first, then it would get around the family.  When your sis calls up yelling about how everyone has turned on her\u2026.just say you only told the truth to people who mentioned it first in someway. You didn\u2019t tell people unlike she did obviously if the family hears about it.", "I think sister has some issues. trying to be in control it strikes me. there is nothing to be 'in control of' but then perhaps she likes to cause other people pain", "THIS!!! This is exactly what it sounds like. She doesn't believe your GF and wanted to challenge the narrative of an illness. A very private illness.", "Type 2 and still need to eat regularly.", "So she\u2019s a shitty mom with bratty kids. Cool.\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s the AH but never, ever again allow anyone, family or otherwise, to dictate that your GF can\u2019t take care of her own health. I\u2019m a bit horrified that your GF would even follow her BS rules and not take an emergency snack. Surely she values her health enough to know it\u2019s *never* worth sacrificing it for someone else\u2019s comfort?", "IF she were diabetic?  Of course they would.  It wouldn't be fair to the kids if she had diabetic snacks!   This woman did it out of pure spite.  Karma will come for her one day.", "Blocking someone in and refusing to move sound like a setup to \u201cprove\u201d that  Girlfriend\u2019s illness isn\u2019t real.", "Ditto", "I have this same issue.

Too often other people are unreliable. It sounds to me like your sister is kind of controlling and had a problem with snacking, and only told you what you needed to hear to get you into her house sans snacks. I\u2019m glad your gf is okay", "You're my hero, I'm now writing a comic book.", "Not eating is a migraine trigger for me. Queue nausea, and if I throw up I feel so much better.
