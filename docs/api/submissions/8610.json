She is seeing a doctor about it, however the doctor said it is hard to treat as it is her body's response back when she had an eating disorder (before we started dating). In general this condition is manageable and she always has snacks with her if she feels hungry and both of us make sure that they are always available (a lot of these snacks are healthy, like dried peas, meat chips, fruits, etc).\n\nLast weekend my sister invited us and the rest of the family for breakfast as she had some news to announce (she lives in a country house quite a distance away from the shops) . She has also asked me and Ann not to bring any snacks since she felt it was disrespectful and caused trouble with her kids. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a medical condition and can't go hungry, to which my sister assured us there will be food when we arrive and it will be ready to eat. Last time it wasn't the case and the food wasn't ready until 4 hours after which is why Ann had to snack on her dried fruits.\n\nWe agreed and arrived in the morning as promised to help my sister. Ann had some fruits for breakfast and coffee. There was no food available but plenty of snacks like nuts, cheese and fruits, so when Ann got hungry and as she didn't have any snacks and the hot food was not ready, she asked my sister if she can snack on the cold food. My sister was not happy about it and started shouting at Ann calling her childish for wanting to eat and she can wait for the hot food since her kids are patiently waiting. I have reminded my sister that Ann has a condition and can not go long times without food, but my sister refused to budge. As my car was blocked by my BIL car due to tight parking, I have asked him to move, so we can go to the shop and get something, but my sister said no as she needs my BIL around to help around and we can just wait till the food is ready. Unfortunately this delay caused Ann to get sick so we had to leave soon after the food was ready, as she wasn't feeling well and carried on throwing up.\n\nMy sister told me that we behaved like an entitled assholes and ruined her announcement, and that Ann was clearly being sick for attention since she wasn't getting any that day. I have reminded her again about Ann's condition, what she said earlier about food being available and said she behaved spoiled and her actions were harsh towards Ann, she should have just let her snack, so she will not be seeing me or her around until she apologies.
