You do not have to like what I have done but is it worth all the harassment that I have had to endure? Would you like it if hundreds of people, some strangers to you, mocked what your house looked like?\n\nIn her quest to be an 'influencer', SIL has turned into a critical bully.

Posting photos of minors without their parents' permission is a big deal and FB and most other platforms will take down the posts promptly when they're reported.\n\nI'd try reporting photos of the interior of your home as well - I believe those would fall under the privacy violation policies.\n\nYou can offer your wife a compromise - your SIL can come over if she turns over her phone at the door and you lock it away for the duration of her visit.  It's returned to her when she walks out.", "NTA. And I only read half.  \nRead the rest of it.

NTA and I\u2019d suggest a tour of the bathroom so her phone can go swimming.", "NTA.   Make a post about your disrespectful  SIL and tag her. It's OK to be a little petty.", "She's just really really RUDE! It's terrible manners to be invited into someone's home as a guest and then be horrible about it, especially publicly. She cares way more what random strangers think than what her family thinks. I wouldn't let her in or let her be around the children. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHere are two links I found concerning laws regarding people posting photos without consent.  Since she used it to BULLY YOU, you may actually be able to do something about it!  I know they are mostly concerning images of you, and not your house, but there may be something in there that you can use.  I only skimmed lightly and did **not** read these thoroughly. \n\nThe first link there is a VERY SHORT section on bullying under Bad Content.  That may be your recourse here.  She may or may not be breaking the law but she is definitely boundary stomping and being really disrespectful.  The safety of your CHILDREN should come first, and your wife should definitely be backing you up on this!!! They are her kids too!!!  All a crazy ass stalker has to do is see one photo of someone to become obsessed with that person, because they are a crazy ass stalker.  Not saying her content attracts crazy stalkers, but you just never know.  \n\nI've had to tell coworkers more than once that if they take a photo and I'm in it, they do NOT have my permission to publish that pic ANYWHERE online or offline.  They are not allowed to use my image in any way shape or form because you have no control once it gets out, it is no longer under anyone's control.  Your face or entire body can be turned into a hurtful meme, that's just one of the horrible things that can happen, and it sucks that people are so selfish they don't even consider how other people feel when they do these things.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.findlaw.com/injury/torts-and-personal-injuries/online-photos--taken-and-posted-without-your-permission.html\n\nhttps://www.legalzoom.com/articles/social-media-and-the-law-5-things-you-need-to-know", "NTA", "NTA (sounds like the only option is to divorce your sister-in-law.

It allows me to remain in close contact with family who are in another country. \n\nThe other side of good thing is bad thing.

They have already expressed discomfort, don't let SIL in your house again.

She's welcome, but her social media isn't.\n\nETA: I think you're right to ban her, but if your wife feels differently, this might be a compromise - one I imagine your SIL will refuse, thus having her ban herself from your home.", "She should care more that *her* sister is making*her* children and *her* husband feel unworthy and uncomfortable. That is the hill to die on, along with the harassment you've received because of her.

The wife is more of a problem at this point than SIL for not protecting her kids and spouse from her sister. OP is facing ridicule from people he knows in real life.
