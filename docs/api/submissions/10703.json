My wife has a sister who is lightly employed and is trying to be a full-time \"influencer\".  She's constantly posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit trying to build a brand.  \n\nI have repeatedly had issues with her \"influencing\".  The constant photos and posts derail almost any event we do with her.  We've had to ask her repeatedly not to post pictures of us or our kids without checking first.  Our kids sometimes say they feel some pressure to look their best at every event because their aunt will be taking/posting photos.  My SIL is also very judgmental and is constantly making posts about how this or that sucks or posts making fun of people, groups, et cetera.  \n\nAt Christmas we hosted my wife's family for a big party.  That included the SIL and her husband.  During the party, they took a look at some work I had done on our house.  During the work I made a design decision that my SIL didn't like.  Unbeknownst to me she took a bunch of pictures and posted them to a subreddit that is all about making fun of other people's houses.  The post included comments about how her BIL(me) didn't know how to decorate, ruined this project, sucks,  et cetera.  \n\nBecause she's building a \"brand\" her Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are all the same.  It took her friends very little time to figure out I was the stupid BIL and to start passing that around on our neighborhood and town social media.  Very quickly I got harassed and made fun of online and occasionally here in town.\n\nI don't want her in our house anymore.  I think this behavior is terrible and this idea that you'd be a guest in someone's home and use that to make fun of them is abhorrent to me.  More, I don't feel like we should be hosting someone who has so little respect for us.

Well, it's working spectacularly well, and I would absolutely ban her from my home too.  \n\nI think causing strangers to harass you warrants a larger conversation with all of your wife's family.

Nobody can act normal or be themselves or wear what they want if she is going to put it all online and put everyone on blast. Where is the privacy and the safe spaces for the children and for us adults? If she won\u2019t value actual human interaction and family, then she needs a reality check as she is demonstrating extremely shallow behaviour. \n\nI agree with you- I would not want her near me or my family, and I wouldn\u2019t attend any gatherings with her in it unless she changes her behavior. \n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdFurther, she owes you a serious apology.

You all need to spell it out for her and show how much trust has been broken.. Boundaries exist for a reason. You protect your family and keep them safe- you don\u2019t blast them online, and let internet strangers demean them.
