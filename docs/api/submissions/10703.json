My wife has a sister who is lightly employed and is trying to be a full-time \"influencer\".  She's constantly posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit trying to build a brand.  \n\nI have repeatedly had issues with her \"influencing\".  The constant photos and posts derail almost any event we do with her.  We've had to ask her repeatedly not to post pictures of us or our kids without checking first.  Our kids sometimes say they feel some pressure to look their best at every event because their aunt will be taking/posting photos.  My SIL is also very judgmental and is constantly making posts about how this or that sucks or posts making fun of people, groups, et cetera.  \n\nAt Christmas we hosted my wife's family for a big party.  That included the SIL and her husband.  During the party, they took a look at some work I had done on our house.  During the work I made a design decision that my SIL didn't like.  Unbeknownst to me she took a bunch of pictures and posted them to a subreddit that is all about making fun of other people's houses.  The post included comments about how her BIL(me) didn't know how to decorate, ruined this project, sucks,  et cetera.  \n\nBecause she's building a \"brand\" her Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are all the same.  It took her friends very little time to figure out I was the stupid BIL and to start passing that around on our neighborhood and town social media.  Very quickly I got harassed and made fun of online and occasionally here in town.\n\nI don't want her in our house anymore.  I think this behavior is terrible and this idea that you'd be a guest in someone's home and use that to make fun of them is abhorrent to me.  More, I don't feel like we should be hosting someone who has so little respect for us.

You have my full blessing to go LC or NC with her.", "NTA. Different people have a different tolerance for putting their lives on social media. You don't want to. You don't want your children involved ( that's very sensible). When she is at your house she should not be posting. Does she want to be an aunt or an influencer? Your children are not props. At family gatherings she needs to post things that don't involve others who have not consented. And state explicitly \" I do not consent\".

If she is going down the route of disrespecting her friends and family for likes then that\u2019s not what people want to see in a good influencer. She will get nowhere of note with that attitude. Go ahead and ban her from your home until she learns boundaries.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s publicly insulted you.

It's rude of her sister to come round and then ridicule you.\n\nBut this is her sister, so I would work on getting on the same page as your wife and making clear how hurt you feel. You need to be a team against outside drama like this.\n\nRather than trying to impose a rule I would tell her that your sister's behaviour makes you feel extremely uncomfortable and has been very rude.

Fucking influencers are a blight upon the world.", "NTA I feel like you have two choices - ban her from the house/events or confiscate all phones.\n\nI appreciate her hustle but it has to be HER hustle without you or your kids. I think elevating yourself by tearing someone else down is garbage behavior.", "Definitely NTA\n\nNever let someone around you or your family who cannot be respectful, especially family. I could see that type of behavior from a stranger, not that it makes it ok, but from family?? Unacceptable behavior, and soon enough, she will alienate more people.", "NTA. My best friend is a pretty big influencer in my country but he never shoves a camera in my face, at get togethers, in each other\u2019s apartments etc. It doesn\u2019t take much to be respectful of the people around you regardless of whether you\u2019re an influencer or not. Your SIL\u2019s behaviour is disgusting. I hope your wife sees things from your perspective though", "NTA\n\nTalk to your wife about the problem with your SIL and not wanting her around the house or your kids anymore.  Her attitude and behavior are toxic and you don't deserve the harrassment she's exposes you to.  Not to mention, there may even be legal avenues for her taking pictures of your kids without your consent if she keeps it up.", "Not the a-hole.  You have attempted to set boundaries with your SIL that are within your rights (i.e. no pictures of yourself, your home, or your kids posted online), and she repeatedly ignores those.  Now, you find out she is the culprit in a purposeful attempt to humiliate and embarrass you in order to \"build her brand.\"  I guess her brand theme is being an a-hole.  Well, it's working spectacularly well, and I would absolutely ban her from my home too.  \n\nI think causing strangers to harass you warrants a larger conversation with all of your wife's family.  It seems likely that other family members are experiencing the same thing, and perhaps, it is time for an intervention.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
