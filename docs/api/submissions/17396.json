The beginning of pregnancy can be the most exhausting as that's where the most development happens so your body is very strained.", "NTA. What about invisible disabilities? You were in the right.", "NTA you are entitled to sit there. The older lady was just being rude and presumptuous.", "NTA at all! I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this. Being pregnant is not all sunshine and belly rubs, it\u2019s your body making another human. If you fell when the bus lurched or even due to fainting you could seriously harm yourself or your baby. This is why pregnant people are included in these special seating designation. You\u2019re NTA for using the seats appropriately. \nYou really can\u2019t be too careful! Once when I was later in pregnancy I was in a check out line at Walmart when I got light headed. I told the person behind me (a total stranger) \u201cI am going to sit over there on a bench so I don\u2019t faint, please let me keep my spot in line\u201d. I left all my stuff on the conveyer belt and waddled myself over to the bench. I was NOT going to pass out onto the icky floor of a Walmart - and no one dared argue with me. When my turn came, I waddled back to the register and thanked the person who let me keep my spot. If I hadn\u2019t sat down I\u2019m quite sure I would have passed out, not ideal. Protect yourself and your baby! Good luck!!", "NTA - in Vienna those seats are pointed out via little drawings, one of them being a pregnant person. Obviously if you would've felt up for it get up, but if you - a conflict averse person - stand your ground you must really really really need it, so no NTA", "Nta", "Old people are so entitled \n\nNta", "NTA- you are one of the people the seats are reserved for. If the bus lurches and you fall, you could lose the baby. Don't ever feel that you're taking away from someone who needs it, because YOU are the person who needs it. \n\nIf that AH who stepped in was so concerned about the lady, he should have given up his seat.\n\nI don't even want to imagine how their heads would explode if they confronted a person with an invisible disability", "NTA: the seat was reserved for your use and you needed to use it, so you did. She can feel how she wants but you had as much right as she did to sit. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.", "NTA. Fuck entitled people who grow old. This happened to me all the time growing up and in twenties because I of course was young so they couldn\u2019t imagine I had a disability. Mine just happened to be invisible. Some days I didn\u2019t need to sit down but when I had a flare up I would be close to tears in pain. The seats are for those that need it. Period. If you\u2019re there first, it\u2019s yours. I\u2019ve seen many older people who actually get up for others because they say they don\u2019t need it.", "NTA. The entitlement of the elderly can be so annoying. Yes, I can absolutely understand giving up a seat for an elderly person. However, some conditions and/or disabilities are not visible. It was totally inappropriate for her and that other person to assume you owed her your seat.", "NTA \n\nWas everybody on that tram either disabled, elderly or pregnant?! \n\nBecause they are the AHs.", "I think NAH here. The lady who asked you to move was a bit rude but honestly so many able bodied people just plop themselves into seats and don\u2019t stand for the elderly and pregnant. I don\u2019t blame her for feeling frustrated either.", "NTA - Unsure why that entire situation went down as you described it. Lots of other people could have volunteered their seats.", "NTA. You have your own reasons for needing to sit, and others don't need to be rude about it, or question your reasoning.\n\nHonestly, this situation reminds me of [this meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EmmBSoIU8AAfHO6?format=jpg&name=900x900).", "NTA and it is a good reminder that you can\u2019t know a persons health or abilities by outward appearance alone.  Anyone of any age can use those seats if needed and they shouldn\u2019t have to defend themselves while doing so.  I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "Absolutely NTA.  I rode the bus when I was pregnant.  The smell and movement killed me.  It took all my willpower not to throw up and having to stand would have resulted in instant hurling on my part.  I'm curious, most buses have multiple designated seats.  Were that all filled by people who should use them or did she single you out?", "NTA, screw that old hag.", "NTA. You are just as deserving of that spot as the elderly woman was, but you got there first and seating is first come first serve. There clearly was another seat she could have anyways. If she wanted that spot so badly she should have waited for the next train.", "NTA - where did kindness and compassion go? How about patience, communication, and understanding? \n\nI no longer understand this world.", "NTA - You had as much claim to that seat as the elderly women did, and you were just sat there first. I'm guessing if you were more visibly pregnant, they wouldn't have even bothered you about it.", "NTA. I used to get this from people eligible for their bus pass but who, based on the way they jumped up and down and ran for the conductor, seemed otherwise healthy.\n\nThose seats are reserved for people who are unable to stand for long periods due to pregnancy, age or disability, visible or not. Standing is a risk of pregnant as rough motion can lead to a fall as well as the fatigue. Older people may be less steady on feet. And disabilities can lead to same issues. I have joint issue so a lot of pain and days off if stand for any time.\n\nAll someone should ask is are you aware you are in a priority seat. If you say you are and stay in it, then thwy should mind own business.", "NTA.\nyou are pregnant, even if you were not exhausted had you fallen it would have been a great deal.\nThere were seats available and even if there were not, there were other people that could have given up their seats.\nDon't even worry about it.", "NTA.   I would tell them not all disabilities are visible and they shouldn't judge.", "NTA. \n\nFalling is a huge pregnancy risk and a freaking tram or bus is definitely where one would take place. You deserve the seat. \n\nMy grandmother, who is pushing 80, can still stand on her head and do backflips. Unfortunately she has set the precedent for me on how elder folks should be \ud83d\ude02 my grandfather (her husband) is 82 and still rides his Harley with no trouble. \n\nIf that old Lady is gonna be such a snot to a stranger then she should get in better shape so she can stand for a period of time.", "NTA\nSeats are first come first serve.", "NTA. She sounds insufferable. I'm glad you told her no on principle.", "\"Are you really pregnant?\"\n\nwow. the conductor is an ass too! and you can see that old lady on tuesday for sure.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe last thing you need is a confrontation like this. I'm sorry that you had to deal with this.", "NTA: boomers are too entitled", "NTA, I'm petty, so I'd have given her the seat and then sat my butt on the floor so they feel bad.  \nCouldn't someone in another seat just give up a seat? I can't with the audacity. And that the conductor asked if you were \"really\" pregnant, like...did he expect you to say you weren't now? Lol.", "NTA - shame on this old lady. You can't know who need what more based off how someone looks.", "NTA. Horrid, entitled people.", "NTA. Just because you are elderly it does not mean you are entitled.  You have just as much of a right to sit in those seats as they do and getting to the latter stages of pregnancy you will need that seat more", "I barely showed when I was pregnant. At 9 months I weighed in at 123lbs. But, man, did I need that seat on the bus! Once a woman tried to get me to move. Told me I didn't look pregnant. So I started a loud non-stop ramble at her.....\"I know, right? My sister is pregnant, too and she's as big as a house! I never swell up either! You look like a person who would swell up, maybe even waddle so everybody would know you were about to pop out a kid! How awful for you! But not me! I can still even tie my shoes! I bet you got as big as my sister, maybe bigger! Like huge, right? So embarrassing to lose your looks like that!\"\n\nThis went on until she turned and moved away from me on the bus. As she left I yelled, \"Have a nice day!\"\n\nDon't mess with cranky pregnant women.", "NTA for sitting there, but ta for saying you need it as much as she does. Not good to presume why or how much someone might need the seat, just like not good that she presumed you didn\u2019t.", "NTA.\n\nWhat about all those not pregnant, able bodied people on that full bus? Why did none of them give their seat to the old lady? No... we ask the pregnant lady and than harass her if she says no. \n\n> The other passenger then said to me that even if I am pregnant, I should always give up a seat to an elderly person as they actually need it more.\n\nNot how it works. If you're pregnant you might need the seat just as much or more (and if you need it you need it, there's no \"but I need it more\", your health and safety matters). Even with 5 months in and no visible bumb. What if you faint? \n\nDon't feel guilty or bad. You're allowed to take up space and use a seat that literally is for disabled, injured, elderly AND pregnant people.", "NTA. You are never wrong to hold your ground against people who want to get their way by bullying and verbal assault, not to mention ganging up. Nobody can possibly know how you feel and how much you need the seat. They just saw you as an easy target to bully.", "NTA- you have every right to sit there. Even if you don\u2019t look pregnant it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not taking a toll on your body. \nDon\u2019t feel bad because someone is clearly a grumpy person. Good for you for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA. What do they want for you to lift your shirt up and show them your pregnant? And no elderly people aren\u2019t more important than pregnant people.", "NTA. \n\nEven if you are not pregnant, invisible disabilities exist. It\u2019s discriminatory to even ask if you have a qualifying disability on the part of the driver.", "NTA. You shouldn't be having to tell strangers your personal medical business. They should have left you alone after you said you needed the seat.", "NTA. Even if you weren't pregnant not all disabilities are visible so no one should assume you're able to stand. You deserved that seat and well done for standing your ground.", "NTA. On public transit non reserved seats are first come, first served. Some seats are reserved for certain classes of people (i.e. elderly people, pregnant people, and people with disabilities). Those seats are first come, first served for people in THOSE CLASSES. People not in those classes may only access those seats when people in those classes are not in need of them. In your case, you two were both in a qualifying class, but you arrived first. Unless the seats list a hierarchy of which of those classes precedes others, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA! In London they have Baby on Board badges for exactly this reason. There is zero expectation a pregnant woman offer a seat; someone else should have offered the older woman a seat.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to say, \u201cI\u2019m having trouble standing, would you mind giving me your seat?\u201d It\u2019s not fine to make assumptions, berate strangers, ask personal questions, or claim that your needs are greater. When you refused, elderly lady could have asked anyone else who was sitting.", "NTA. Not all mobility needs are visible! \n\nI had foot surgery last year, and the week I graduated from a very visible walking-boot to a normal ish walking shoe, I became very aware that no one around me could tell why I was walking slowly, or why I needed to sit on the bus. I looked young and healthy again, despite barely being able to walk faster than a shuffle, in a bustling city where freely mobile people complain about slow walkers. I take the bus and metro everywhere, and I definitely wondered if I\u2019d have an experience like yours before I was healed up properly.", "NTA.  you did nothing wrong and I am sorry you were meant to feel like you did. Obviously, if she could yell at you and cause enough of a ruckus, she wasn't that infirm.", "NTA and I agree those \u201cconcerned\u201d passengers should of gave up their seat", "NTA", "The seats were for elderly, pregnant or disabled. You were not elderly.  Stand up.  Oh, sorry, you\u2019re pregnant. Sit down.  Your pregnancy is causing temporary disability (difficulty with daily living skills like standing or staying awake, not to mention back and bladder issues). Stay seated.  First come first served.  You can\u2019t quantify need.  You needed it, you keep it.  Other seating was available and they are all equally uncomfortable.", "> *\"By this point we had reached the next stop and the tram conductor came to see what the yelling was about. The older lady told him what was happening and he looked at me and said; \"Are you really pregnant?\" to which I obviously said yes.\"*\n\nFUCK NO.\n\nPregnant > Old\n\nAbsolutely NTA", "Throw up on all of them", "TBF it doesn't sound like the other nosy passenger had a seat either. But they should have just shut up.", "Yep. NTA.", "Why do I have a feeling that the person who told a pregnant woman that an elderly person needed the seat more than her was a man?", "Definitely NTA and the other passenger who told you the elderly person needed it more can huff my duff. If the elderly person falls they could get hurt, if the pregnant person falls that person AND their baby could get hurt, plush the have zero idea what the limits and physical condition of either of you could be. I\u2019m not as shy and would have lifted my shirt to show them the full on baby belly and told them to go to hell.", "I passed out on the bus once when I was pregnant with my first child. Someone cleared a spot for me, thankfully, and I never passed up a seat on the bus when I was pregnant again. It was so scary. Plus at the end of a long day on my feet, I'd have intense round ligament pains. There were definitely other issues, but gosh, pregnancy can really suck even when it's otherwise perfect.", "So true. My blood pressure was so low, I was not allowed to drive while pregnant because my dizzy spells would cause me to pull over on the side of the road until I felt better", "The first half of pregnancy when you\u2019re not showing is the worst. I felt the worst then, but everyone figured I was probably just on a carb binge lol", "It\u2019s insane to me that people assume they can visually verify everything. Obviously people are pregnant way before we can tell they are! That doesn\u2019t make them somehow less pregnant or less in need of that seat. \n\nOn the same idea, not all disabilities are necessarily visible! People don\u2019t need to give their damn health history to prove they do fall into the \u201ccorrect category\u201d for the seat. \n\nNTA.", "And the fact that the driver did not ask you to move confirms this.", "came here to bump awareness for invisible disabilities /illnesses.  asking someone sitting in one of those seats why they do or don't qualify is such an invasion of personal privacy and no one owes an AH like that an explanation.  NTA", ">where it isn\u2019t visibly apparent, like people with hidden disabilities or invisible illnesses.\n\nThis. **Very much this.**", "There are places where it is actually a requirement but she was also in the class that gets priority for the seat.", "I'm not. Dispite lived experience, people associate pregnancy with like 7-9 month large baby bump. So with her baggy clothing she must have not looked pregnat to them.They had a bone to pick with the young woman because she was young and they thought they could walk all over her.", "I fractured a hip slipping on ice when I was 34 weeks pregnant.  When the midwife got the x-rays that proved it after I gave birth,  she almost had a heart attack.", "In op's case never tho. I wouldn't trust someone exhausted and pregnant  to stand on mass transit. Just typeing that sounds dangerous.", "Why didn't any of the other passengers offer their seat? Were they all disabled, old or pregnant?", "\u201cHuff my duff\u201d I\u2019m going to use this one!", "Can confirm. I once sat on the floor in Walmart, which wasn\u2019t particularly what I wanted to do, while pregnant because I\u2019d gotten so hot and lightheaded in there.", "Not a train a tram. And they are really easy to fall on if they stop or take off suddenly. Worse than a fast moving train.", "So many people think you only need accommodations for pregnancy during late third trimester when you\u2019re undeniably pregnant. I personally had low blood pressure induced fainting spells from only a few weeks in and SI joint dysfunction from early second trimester. Pregnancy impacts a body WAY before you\u2019re visibly pregnant, and affects everyone so differently, you really have no idea what\u2019s going on looking at a person (pregnant or otherwise)", "Yessss! Thank you for that add on. It\u2019s such an invasion of what can be very personal and emotional.", "When you say required... do you mean that's in the terms of service you agree to when you buy a ticket? \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all for polite and/or common sense rules to keep society cordial, like letting people off the tram before you try to get on the tram... so I respect those little stickers indicating priority seating as much as possible. \nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the word required?", "I don't think those seats differentiate between the two.", "I always end up on those seats by the till where you usually find elderly people waiting for their taxis. I\u2019ve only just started showing but I\u2019ve needed to do it from the start. The fatigue/ lightheadedness can be so overwhelming and very sudden!"]}
