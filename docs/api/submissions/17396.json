Just sharing because it\u2019s nice to have a story about someone acknowledging invisible illnesses and helping out.", "1) That has nothing to do with what I said. My point was that when those seats you mentioned are filled up, the elderly and disabled need to be able to sit as their conditions can't be helped. On the other hand, OP CHOSE to get pregnant despite knowing she'd keep using public transportation. For the record, I'm all for improved pub trans systems as that's what would ultimately solve this problem. You'd seen that if you truly read my reply\n\n2)  By her own admission, OP is young, healthy, no stated medical complications, and is fit to the point you can barely tell she's pregnant. So, outside the usual fatigue, she's  fit and healthy to stand. Far more than the disabled and elderly.\n\n3) I really do question this story. OP looks virtually nonpregnant, then tops it off with baggy clothes?! Like, what? Then why would OP get upset when strangers who don't know her didn't think she was pregnant? She claims to be \"shy and non confrontational,\" but she sure had no problem doubling down, refusing to budge. So much so that she claims another fellow bus rider scolded her on it, yet she still sat there.  I think there's more to this that she's leaving out.", "Somebody else already answered, but yes, there are places where you get a fine if you do not give up the seat to somebody who needs it if you are not in one of the priority categories.", "Required as in if the bus driver or other transit employee  asks you to give up the seat and you don\u2019t, the transit employee is empowered to eject you from the bus, and if you don\u2019t get off, will call the transit police who will kindly \u201callow\u201d you a transfer from the bus to the back of a squad car, and your getting arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to obey the directions of a transit employee.", "I doubt there is only one reserved seat. There were probably other people who could have moved.", "Oh, this is for Australia btw lol\n\nSorry if I confused you", "Yeah, I used to have to \u201cput on a show\u201d and exaggerate my symptoms to \u201cjustify\u201d my need for a seat. Public transportation requires such a mind game with others. When pregnant, hold lower back, rub stomach so people know. I don\u2019t think anyone should feel like they Have to do this because others should assume the best.  I did it to relieve my own paranoia that others were mad at me."]}
