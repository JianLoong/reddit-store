Pregnancy causes the human body to exist at the limits of like high endurance athletes for months at a time. That comes with aches, pains, instability, fatigue etc. \n\nThere\u2019s also the safety concern. Many pregnant people have low blood pressure, making them dizzier and more prone to falling. You\u2019re also off balance because your weight distribution isn\u2019t what you\u2019re used to. And falling while pregnant can be anything from minorly sore to VERY VERY SERIOUS depending on how you land, luck etc. Sorry, but I\u2019m not risking my babies life for etiquette!\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and I\u2019m sorry they made you feel like you did.", "Nta - if the other passenger was so concerned they can give up their seat.", "NTA imo.

Oh boy.\n\nThere was other seats available.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou needed that seat. Someone else could have offered the elderly a seat, and there was a free one at the front anyway. She shouldn\u2019t have kept harassing you.", "NTA\n\n\"I needed the seat as much as she did.\" There, you said it yourself. As humans/society, we try to make life a bit more fear for people in needs, but at the end of the day, sometime life isn't fair.

I think someone else should have given up their seat since I doubt every single person on the tram was in desperate need, it\u2019s not fair to be treated that way just because you don\u2019t look like you need it. I also find demanding you move like that very rude and entitled tbh.", "NTA. why on earth would people feel like an rude old woman would deserve a place to sit more than a person literally growing a whole ass person inside of them", "NTA.

Someone invaded your space by tapping you on the shoulder. Wanting your seat. You said no. Perfectly valid. \n\nThey made assumptions of to your validity to occupy said seat. Well you know you meet the criteria.  Not all needs for that seat are visable. \n\nLike handicap parking spaces.

There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s any of her business to ask your personal situation, she should have moved on as soon as your said you\u2019re pregnant. \n\nI hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well and you feel less fatigued soon.", "NTA, I recently got out of the military and don\u2019t have any documents on me to prove I served nor do I have any proof I have a bad back and bad knees not to mention I have flat feet so standing for long periods of times sucks.

Pfft she's definitely TA here hun.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA.\n\nIt sucks when there aren't enough dedicated seats for people who need them on a tram/train but in that instance, it's first come first served for people who need them.

You\u2019re unfortunately not alone in this predicament and you were right to stand your ground.", ">even if I am pregnant, I should always give up a seat to an elderly person as they actually need it more.\n\nThere's no certain way to determine that but my spidey senses are saying that if the old lady had the energy to bully you and yell you so loud that the conductor showed up shows that she has good lungs and stamina. \n\nYou were just as in need of the seat as she was for all we know, maybe more. You came first. \n\nNTA.", "NTA-I'm surprised she didn't stop after you explained you're pregnant.", "NTA. If you would have felt fine standing but just didn't feel like it, that would be different.
