It doesn't seem right for your Dad to ask you to exclude your mother from your wedding; that sounds like him using you to get revenge on her. If that's what YOU want, then fine, but he shouldn't ask.

I don\u2019t care that your mom had an affair and married the affair partner. Is cheating shitty? Yes. Do I care about the upheaval you had to go through in your childhood? Yes. Regardless of all of that, your dad has zero leg to stand on giving you ultimatums about walking you down the aisle, or any other attempts at alienation he has facilitated since the divorce. Any bad mouthing of your mother he has done in front of you is wrong. Placing his ego over you having both parents at your wedding is horrible. \n\nYour mom sucks for indicating to your stepdad that he would be walking you down the aisle (if she did. He may have assumed that on his own). She may suck for a lot of other reasons too, but the affair is absolutely unimportant to this situation. Your step dad sucks for absolutely every reason, unless there\u2019s some part you\u2019re leaving out where your dad abandoned you for years and he physically and financially supported you during that time. At that point, I\u2019d have some understanding of how hurtful this was for him, but still think he was an asshole for handling it this poorly. \n\nYou suck for not putting your foot down with your father. If he would refuse to walk you down the aisle if your mother attends your wedding, he doesn\u2019t deserve to do to. If you don\u2019t want your mom to attend for your reasons, I\u2019m totally onboard with that. Letting your father stipulate that, and get away with treating you that way, is pretty awful. \n\nI\u2019m going to leave you with this: cheating is wrong and awful. It feels awful to be cheated on. It\u2019s soul crushing. I\u2019ve been there. It also rarely happens in a void. Relationships are tough. Your mom is responsible for cheating and that is an awful thing. She is not solely responsible for your parent\u2019s divorce. She almost certainly didn\u2019t cheat in a happy marriage where she was treated well. Your father\u2019s seeming belief that he should get to control everything, and that his feelings should be catered to/placed at top priority, even on your wedding day, says a lot about the kind of person he is. Unfortunately, your stepfather seems just as bad. Your mother may be as well. I\u2019m sorry for you for being in this situation that is not your fault, but unless you really didn\u2019t want your mom and step dad at your wedding, weren\u2019t going to invite them anyway, and your feelings about that have nothing to do about how your father spoke about your mother while you were growing up, it\u2019s shitty of you to have caved to his demand.", "NTA\n\nI came here to say that your father should not have made demands regarding your guest list. I get that infidelity is very traumatic and I understand that there are likely many issues between your birth parents that caused them to end their marriage. I acknowledge their pain. However. \nYou\u2019ve been an adult now for almost as long as you were a child. I\u2019m doing the math here and we\u2019re about maybe two decades past the death of their relationship with each other- and you\u2019re STILL a pawn in their grudge? So- it sounds like- and maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it sure sounds like they\u2019d rather USE you to play their spite game than show up CORRECT on your wedding day. \nThis is your wedding. \nWhat do you envision as ideal of them on this day? That\u2019s what you should ask for and that\u2019s what you should get. It\u2019s ridiculous of mom, dad and stepdad to place any restrictions or demands on their participation in your day. \nAll three of them should knock off whatever childish crap they have going on- not to minimize anyones pain- but they should all show up and behave. \nI\u2019d go back and rephrase your invite to all of them. \nDress up.\nShow up. \nWalk where you\u2019re supposed to walk.\nSit where I tell you to sit. \nPose for the pics that you\u2019re asked to pose for. \nAnd avoid each other and be civil if you must interact, and then exit peacefully without incident.\n\nBecause this will be the one and only wedding day you get for you and they all seem more than happy to crap on your day to get in their digs at each other. But wouldn\u2019t you rather have the happiest memories of your day that is not at all about their decades old drama? You\u2019ve already spent the better part of your life on their issue. You can ask for one damn day. Hell it\u2019s not even a whole damn day! We\u2019re talking a couple hours for them. But this one event will last you the rest of your life.

I\u2019m going to assume your mom said something to him since he called with the impression he\u2019d be walking you down the aisle.", "NTA\n\nFor some reason, your Mom is playing games to both get your step-dad\u2019s hopes up and turn him against you all at the same time. \n\nThis is your Mom\u2019s doing, not yours.", "You know the difference between aisle and isle? Me thinks this post is a crock. Why on Earth would your stepdad be invited and not your mother? And she's okay with that? And why would he have the audacity to think he could would be walking you down the aisle when your dad is alive and kicking? Just seems fishy to me.", "Your mom definitely told him you agreed to let him walk you. Some petty revenge to get back at you for picking your father over her or some shit. You didn\u2019t lead him on. You never told him he was gonna walk you. NTA", "How did you lead him on? He was invited to a wedding. He wasn\u2019t invited to walk you down the aisle.\n\nI would rescind the invitation since he said your actual father who took part in raising you \u201cisn\u2019t your real dad anymore\u201d- how insulting. He didn\u2019t die or abandon you- he was the victim! Sounds like your mom is still playing games\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s been nearly 3 decades. It\u2019s not fair if your real dad to ask you to not invite your real mom to your wedding, even though she\u2019s a cheating cheater. He needs to suck it up and deal with their presence for YOUR day. He doesn\u2019t need to talk to them, look at them, or interact with them at all. He just needs to tolerate being in the same room with them, for your sake\u2026. Assuming you actually want her there.\n\nAll your parents are being AHs.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA", "My parents haven't spoken in over 20 years.  They both still came to my wedding and just stayed away from each other.  We did different photos so they didn't have to be near each other and they were at different tables.\n\nYour father making his attendance conditional on your mother's absence is not ok.  He can ask not to be seated at the same table, he can ask not to do photos together, etc but insisting she not attend is problematic behaviour.", "NTA", "Does he have any daughters with your mom? \n\nMaybe this is his only shot at being the father of the bride?", "NTA\n\nInviting him to the wedding is not asking him to escort you. He and your mom are AHs. I am sure your mom did not set this up to upset your step dad but she has messed up big time again.", "ESH. Your dad does because he refuses to go unless your mom isn\u2019t there. He doesn\u2019t have to interact with her but to refuse to be in the same place? Ridiculous. Especially your own child\u2019s wedding. \n\nYou could have been clear from the beginning \u201cstepdad you are invited but my dad will be there\u201d \n\nBut your stepdads reaction??? Absolutely uncalled for and ridiculous.", "NTA to step dad. Kind of TA for letting your dad keep your mom away from your wedding. Picking one parent over another.", "Ya the way to wrote this makes it more on your mother.", "[removed]", "I'm honestly curious to what OP's mother told to SD to make him think she was inviting him to walk her down the aisle.", "My thoughts exactly. She isn\u2019t adopted, so he isn\u2019t her bio dad. He\u2019s her dad. I can\u2019t figure out why anyone would ever think he wouldn\u2019t be the one to walk her down the aisle.\n\nAnd yes, dad shouldn\u2019t be guilty OP into not inviting her mom. The choice is hers.", "Given how this played out, I suspect OP has other reasons for not wanting her mother there.", "How exactly is OP TA here?  You can make an argument for all three parental figures quite easily. I do not understand what OP did to be TA; not inviting her mother?

I have family like that, too. But OP shouldn\u2019t be put in the middle of their crazy", "She lived with mom and stepdad 26 days a month and with dad 4 days a month. It doesn't sound like her dad tried hard to be more involved, so he didn't do the work of raising her. I think most people would assume dad would be the first choice, but maybe stepdad feels like he's more of a parent to her.", "hmm yeah you could be right and given OPs responses and lack of any proper info i tend to agree with you.", "NTA. Your mom is messed up for doing that and being ok with ur step dad thinking you led him on. When in reality it\u2019s your mom playing games. Your stepdad had no right to say anything about your dad cuz he is the one effed up not your dad. Enjoy your wedding with your dad and forget about your stepdad he\u2019s the one being the AH.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nnothing you said here sounds like you were expecting your stepdad to walk to down the aisle.

Just because your step dad gets invited doesn't mean he's automatically the one to walk you down the aisle.", "Girl, I would not shed a tear.  NTA and enjoy your stress free wedding.", "your mother probably led him on but you most certainly did not. your father is well and alive and very much still your father to you and thats what matters. NTA", "NTA but why would you invite your mom or step dad? Leave them both out.", "You're NTA, but you are surrounded by assholes. Your bio dad shouldn't get to decide that your mother doesn't get to go to the wedding and using walking you down the aisle hostage over it is a big AH move. Your mom is an AH for insisting that your step-dad be invited (who she has to know you don't like) and probably telling him he was going to walk you down the aisle. Your step-dad is the asshole for the stuff he said about your bio dad not being your 'real' dad. \n\nYou need to set boundaries with all of them, NOW. What's going to happen when you have children? Are they going to be put in the middle of this ridiculous tug-of-war too? Yes, your mother cheated and ended up marrying her cheating partner. That sucks. But it's been decades at this point and everyone needs to put all their little feelings aside and be there for you and the new family you are building. Congrats on the wedding, I pray for peace and love for you.", "Stop acting like a little girl. You are going to get marry. You are an adult. Don't invite any of them. Go NC with them and enjoy your life. NTA.", "NTA! This isn't on you. It's your mother's game. Somehow she transmuted the invitation to attend into an invitation to walk. But SD's hurt feelings won't fade with time. You have to corner Mom in the presence of SD and force her admission to what she did. Even face to face with the two of you, be prepared for her to continue to lie.", "NTA.", "And why was SD perfectly fine with the fact that OP's mother, his wife, wasn't being invited but he was?", "He\u2019s punishing her mom and her.

Almost!", "One of my cousin\u2019s married a guy whose family was terribly split. It was so bad that one grandma had punch the other grandma in the face. They absolutely loathed each other. It was bad. But, the called a truce for the wedding. The mom\u2019s side stayed on one side of the venue. Dad\u2019s side stayed on the other side of the venue.

I cannot stand parents who can\u2019t stop fighting for big events like that.", "This kind of parents\u2019 bs is why I eloped.", "NTA. But everyone around you is an ass, even your bio dad. He should have been there to walk you down the aisle without asking you to chose between your mother and him. Your mother may have done him dirty DECADES ago but asking you to not have your mother at your wedding isn't fair to her or you.", "NTA, your mom definitely led him on. I wouldn\u2019t invite him tbh; it sounds like she may have wanted a power play over your dad", "NTA\n\nHow the fuck did you \u2018lead him on\u2019 when your Dad is still in your life and you DIDN\u2019T ASK HIM?\n\nHe\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA, your mom is playing cruel mind games with you so you end up as the villain.
