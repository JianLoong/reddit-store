Your kid wedding suck it up.\nYou for excluding your mom and not realizing that your stepdad wants to be part of your life.

I don\u2019t care that your mom had an affair and married the affair partner. Is cheating shitty? Yes. Do I care about the upheaval you had to go through in your childhood? Yes. Regardless of all of that, your dad has zero leg to stand on giving you ultimatums about walking you down the aisle, or any other attempts at alienation he has facilitated since the divorce. Any bad mouthing of your mother he has done in front of you is wrong. Placing his ego over you having both parents at your wedding is horrible. \n\nYour mom sucks for indicating to your stepdad that he would be walking you down the aisle (if she did. He may have assumed that on his own). She may suck for a lot of other reasons too, but the affair is absolutely unimportant to this situation. Your step dad sucks for absolutely every reason, unless there\u2019s some part you\u2019re leaving out where your dad abandoned you for years and he physically and financially supported you during that time. At that point, I\u2019d have some understanding of how hurtful this was for him, but still think he was an asshole for handling it this poorly. \n\nYou suck for not putting your foot down with your father. If he would refuse to walk you down the aisle if your mother attends your wedding, he doesn\u2019t deserve to do to. If you don\u2019t want your mom to attend for your reasons, I\u2019m totally onboard with that. Letting your father stipulate that, and get away with treating you that way, is pretty awful. \n\nI\u2019m going to leave you with this: cheating is wrong and awful. It feels awful to be cheated on. It\u2019s soul crushing. I\u2019ve been there. It also rarely happens in a void. Relationships are tough. Your mom is responsible for cheating and that is an awful thing. She is not solely responsible for your parent\u2019s divorce. She almost certainly didn\u2019t cheat in a happy marriage where she was treated well. Your father\u2019s seeming belief that he should get to control everything, and that his feelings should be catered to/placed at top priority, even on your wedding day, says a lot about the kind of person he is. Unfortunately, your stepfather seems just as bad. Your mother may be as well. I\u2019m sorry for you for being in this situation that is not your fault, but unless you really didn\u2019t want your mom and step dad at your wedding, weren\u2019t going to invite them anyway, and your feelings about that have nothing to do about how your father spoke about your mother while you were growing up, it\u2019s shitty of you to have caved to his demand.", "NTA\n\nI came here to say that your father should not have made demands regarding your guest list. I get that infidelity is very traumatic and I understand that there are likely many issues between your birth parents that caused them to end their marriage. I acknowledge their pain. However. \nYou\u2019ve been an adult now for almost as long as you were a child. I\u2019m doing the math here and we\u2019re about maybe two decades past the death of their relationship with each other- and you\u2019re STILL a pawn in their grudge? So- it sounds like- and maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it sure sounds like they\u2019d rather USE you to play their spite game than show up CORRECT on your wedding day. \nThis is your wedding. \nWhat do you envision as ideal of them on this day? That\u2019s what you should ask for and that\u2019s what you should get. It\u2019s ridiculous of mom, dad and stepdad to place any restrictions or demands on their participation in your day. \nAll three of them should knock off whatever childish crap they have going on- not to minimize anyones pain- but they should all show up and behave. \nI\u2019d go back and rephrase your invite to all of them. \nDress up.\nShow up. \nWalk where you\u2019re supposed to walk.\nSit where I tell you to sit. \nPose for the pics that you\u2019re asked to pose for. \nAnd avoid each other and be civil if you must interact, and then exit peacefully without incident.\n\nBecause this will be the one and only wedding day you get for you and they all seem more than happy to crap on your day to get in their digs at each other. But wouldn\u2019t you rather have the happiest memories of your day that is not at all about their decades old drama? You\u2019ve already spent the better part of your life on their issue. You can ask for one damn day. Hell it\u2019s not even a whole damn day! We\u2019re talking a couple hours for them. But this one event will last you the rest of your life.

How braindead does your stepdad need to be to not grasp that there's a reason why his wife won't be attending? That's because her ex, your dad, will be there. Who the hell do you think would walk you down the aisle then? Simple logic applied to this would disabuse him of this notion.\n\nI suspect this was a ploy by your mom to make you pay for uninviting her from the wedding by putting this idea in your stepdad's head. That's why she agreed without a fight; she was planning revenge. According to your post she also asked for your stepdad to be invited.\n\nFrankly, if that is the case (I might be wrong but man it sure looks like it) then that's grounds for telling them both to piss off. When you do, point this incident out to them, along with the past infidelity that resulted in that relationship and you having to deal with this.

Personally I\u2019d uninvited them all given their demands, or tell them they should all come and politely ignore each other for your sake. \n\nWhy do you need a male parent to walk you down the aisle so badly you\u2019d kick your mother out - and yet include her affair partner as a guest? This makes no sense. I\u2019d walk myself or maybe have someone else I love do it.

He should have the grace to put aside his desires on this one day.  Your step-dad is acting out of pain,  and his reaction was inappropriate, but I wonder what sort of picture your mother painted for him. I hope your wedding day goes well.

NTA! They're the parents. After all of these years it is their job to be grownups for you!

Why are you letting your dad dictate that your mom can't be involved?\n\nSorry, I can't get past that. You have TWO parents. If you don't give a crap about one, say so.

Requesting to be put away from his ex would be understandable, forcing a choice between him and OPs mother isn't. If OP chooses not to include their mother due to their own scars that is ok but it should be their choice without manipulation. That being said OPs mother is just as bad for causing this misunderstanding and likely trying to use guilt to get her AP in the ceremony.
