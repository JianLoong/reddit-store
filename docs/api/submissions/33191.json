We had a great relationship up until our engagement. He has ever since the engagement tried to push to do things I didn\u2019t want. For example, I have jet black hair and I love it that way. My fianc\u00e9 always had a thing for blonde and red heads. I never understood why but he would tell me red heads esp were really attractive to him. He had never addressed such things to me prior to getting engaged. And now he wants me to either dye my hair ginger or bleach and blonde. We have had this conversation more than seven times and more than seven times I have said no. My hair has never been coloured or gone through any chemicals before and I want to keep it that way. \nHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks it\u2019s selfish of me to not consider his choice of interest esp when he \u201cproposed\u201d to me to \u201cget married\u201d. \nSo much so he brought this up in family dinner last night and his family sided with him.

You're NTA but if he's already doing this now, it's likely just gonna get worse. For now it's your hair, next it'll be something far harder to change.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t you find it interesting though OP that the moment you got engaged all of a sudden he wants to morph you into his own fantasy and when you say no he brings it up in front of his family and makes you out to be the problem? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nI think this is a glimpse of controlling behaviour to come and you need to see this for the warning sign it is \n\nToss the ring back at him and RUN!!!!!

And he called me \u201ctypical Asian boring black haired\u201d (he\u2019s white American)\n\nWHY THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL ENGAGED TO HIM AFTER THIS?\n\nGIRL!", "NTA: I'm going to address these in order:\n\n\n>He had never addressed such things to me prior to getting engaged. And now he wants me to either dye my hair ginger or bleach and blonde.\n\nHe likely feels more secure to test his limits and your boundaries now that you've agreed to a lifetime commitment. Ask yourself how all this makes you feel and tell him honestly. How you feel and his reaction to your feelings will tell you if you want to spend a lifetime feeling the way you do.\n\n\n>We have had this conversation more than seven times and more than seven times I have said no.\n\n\"No.\" Is a sentence. It's foolish and rude, but asking once is forgivable. But continuing to ask another 6 times is so disrespectful to you. This person cares more for his preferences than your feelings and your well-being. Black hair will ABSOLUTELY get damaged in the bleaching process. I add color in highlights in my islander thick dark straight hair. I can do that because I put great care in it. Even with that, there's still a thinning of the hair. Bleaching the whole thing will do damage you cannot undo. Not to mention exposing you to chemicals and a lot of cost up front and regular cost to upkeep. This is not a cheap look to keep looking well. In so many ways, your well-being and personal preference for YOUR BODY is not being put first. \n\n>However, my fianc\u00e9 thinks it\u2019s selfish of me to not consider his choice of interest esp when he \u201cproposed\u201d to me to \u201cget married\u201d.\n\nFew things, I would agree attraction is important so a partner suddenly not taking care of themselves or making some drastic change you would consider your partner's preferences. This isn't politely telling your partner I don't care for this style/haircut, or saying to them you prefer when they do xyz. This is your partner asking you not to look like a \n\n>\u201ctypical Asian boring black haired\u201d\n\nThis is offensive on many levels. You know this. You didn't need to come here for conformation to know that this hurt and upset you. Why? Tell him why. Ask yourself if knowing why even matters at this point? I would have a hard time if someone called something that was a cultural feature of my people, like my thick dark hair, \"typical and boring.\" I would have a hard time getting over that. Seeing them ask, then push...\nThen push.\nThen push.\nThen push.\nThen push.\nThen push.\nThen push.\nThat would be an issue for me. \n\nIf he wants a white woman so bad, he should go find one. There is an abundance of lonely men out there that will appreciate the things that make you you. Who will look at you in wonder for the traits you have. Either because they are so foreign to them or because they are proud to be with someone in their culture. It's upsetting that your partner doesn't admire what is likely beautiful hair. Women out here pay a fortune to have your hair. It has real monetary value it's so admired. I'd be offended. \n\nThe sad thing is, if he has a fantasy/fetish for different colored hair and just approached you with respect, love, and honesty, you guys could've invested in wigs for your private time. It could've been your inside secret. Something weird and silly and fun that made your time alone *spicy* sometimes. This, this, is a lesson in how to devalue your partner to pressure them into submitting to your whim, power, fantasy, or fetish. With zero consideration for the partner's preferences or concern for their feelings in his selfish pursuit to achieve his preferred look in a fiance. \n\nLastly and most importantly? I would insist on having an honest conversation about his expectations of you as a wife. He is expressing that he should have more of a say to your person now that he has proposed marriage and you accepted. What else are you expected to run past him for approval? What else should you change about yourself to make yourself agreeable to him? What else about you should he have a say in? How willing is he to meet your expectations for a fiance, then a husband in return? What things of your culture is he willing to adopt because it suits you better?\n\nEdited, missed some typos. My bad\n\nEdited after seeing the the family dinner part!!\n\nDid this family dinner include you? Was this at his home, your home, or the family home they do holiday dinners, etc at? Was this him asking you this while you were one person against his entire family? Did he call you the above in front of your face? Or is this something he told you he asked his family about when he went home for Thanksgiving or some such fall/winter holiday? Can he be trusted to relay the truth? How do you feel about him asking his family for input on what you should do with your body? \n\nWas this a casual, \"I think she'd look pretty blonde...\" and people weighed in politely? It's rude on his part because you told him previously how you felt. Not rude on theirs. However, if they all sat there discussing and pressuring you? That's not ok. What else do they get to weigh in on? Why does he value their opinion on your body more than yours?Are you ok with this?\n\nAs for the micro aggression mentioned in the comments by sarcastic-pedant, I'm a firm believer there are people who say the wrong thing because they are naive, ignorant, uneducated, etc. Those are teachable moments. Then there's times where you feel it, it's just a bit malicious. You know when someone is degrading you with a friendly smile on their face. Did this feel like they were pressuring you or devaluing you? If they get a say in your haircut, I cannot imagine they won't expect a say on your kids. I had a unique upbringing, I can tell you, kids can feel it when their family members do this. You have a lot to consider because marriage isn't just a relationship, it's a LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT in every town in every nation, marriage has rules that bind up your lives. Never take that lightly", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get to dictate your physical appearance. If he wants a redhead or a blonde for a wife so badly, why is he engaged to a noirette?

If so, he should stop insulting or trying to change you, apologize, fess up, and ask you if you\u2019d be willing to try on some wigs for him.\n\nIt might not be a deal breaker. For example, he might have a fantasy about hooking up with you when you\u2019re wearing a \u201csexy cop\u201d outfit but not actually be wanting to hook up with a police officer who is not you. If his fantasy is of a tame nature, he could have been less of an immature gaslighting racist AH about it.

That might not be solveable or resolvable through therapy, but only you and your fianc\u00e9 if you decide to give him a chance can decide if it\u2019s worth even trying to get to the bottom of this and see if it can be worked out at all.\n\nYou are beautiful, loyal, special, and perfect just the way you are naturally OP. I\u2019m sorry your new fianc\u00e9 and long time bf and his parents have been hurtful to and gaslighting you. Get your own counselor who is good and experienced in these types of issues who you find helpful for your decision making, emotional support, sounding board, and healing, before you go cold or blind into a couples therapy session with an unknown counselor who might just make matters worse if it\u2019s some misogynist culturally insensitive racist AH creeper too.\n\nGood luck, OP. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve been experiencing this pain, confusion, disorientation, and recent doubts.\n\nThat really sucks.\n\nCouples therapy at minimum seems required at this point for your health and wellness as his comments and his parents\u2019 apparent affirmation of this is damaging to you and creepy and toxic to infect your relationship with right after his recent proposal. \n\nIt\u2019s possible he\u2019s rebeling against you and being irrational unreasonable and manipulative because on some level he\u2019s afraid, insecure, uncertain, or cowardly. \n\nHe may have already cheated or been in situations where he would have if the other person/people had returned his advances. Has he recently been watching porn with blondes and redheads, or having fantasties about people he met or knows or works with who are blondes or gingers, or where is this suddenly coming from and why now?\n\nDoes he think if you dye your hair or bleach your hair he\u2019ll be less likely to or want less to cheat on you with a blonde or ginger or has he already done so? And what\u2019s with the \u201cboring typical Asian\u201d insult? \n\nYour bf/fianc\u00e9 loved, appreciated, and wanted you enough for the last seven years where you haven\u2019t been concealing from him your natural hair color etc but right after he proposes he decides you\u2019re boring and selfish? \n\nI don\u2019t get it.\n\nI like the person\u2019s suggestion about you might enjoy for fun sometime trying out a blonde or red wig, but it probably might not be as fun for you but possibly just hurtful and demeaning in light of the doubts this has raised and the demeaning way your fianc\u00e9 and his parents have treated his unreasonable demands and insults as acceptable and your refusal to indulge his new desire as you being selfish etc. This seems like gaslighting.\n\nY\u2019all have been together since you were 17 and he was 19. Why did he even propose instead of be honest and self aware enough to have suggested years ago that y\u2019all see other people and that he felt like he needed to play the field a little or sow his wild oats before settling down or he\u2019d always have doubts about this or resent you for trapping him (despite that he proposed to you and you presumably have been faithful to him despite having other offers/options for years)?\n\nIt\u2019s important if possible that you get to the bottom of this and that he\u2019s honest with himself and you about what\u2019s going on. Couples therapy and counseling might help you with trying to determine whether this is temporary insanity panic mode with casually racist future in-laws or whether it\u2019s in your best interests right now to break off the engagement and step away from this relationship.\n\nThese are troubling red flags and indeed peculiar timing, OP. Your courageous and self-aware enough to take it seriously rather than let people tell convince you're just being selfish, boring, or making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nQuote from OP\u2019s post:\n\nHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks it\u2019s selfish of me to not consider his choice of interest esp when he \u201cproposed\u201d to me to \u201cget married\u201d. So much so he brought this up in family dinner last night and his family sided with him. And he called me \u201ctypical Asian boring black haired\u201d (he\u2019s white American)", "NTA.

So what do you think will be next on his list. You need to lose 20lbs, I think you need breast implants, don't you think you should exercise your legs are getting flabby, that colour doesn't suit you, those heels make me appear short, that shirt shows to much cleavage. Where will it end? \n\nSo if you look terrible after dyeing your hair, what then. Does he have any idea of the upkeep? Oh, those roots look great with red/blonde. Hair grows.\nKeep the hair. Maybe you could find someone to love you as you are.", "It\u2019s not about the hair colour, OP. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s about control and about making you feel insecure that you\u2019re not his \u201ctype\u201d, which is obviously nonsense because he\u2019s with you. He is trying to dent your confidence.\nI can guarantee you if you dye your hair, something else won\u2019t be right. You will never be able to please this man, no one could. I know this because I dated someone who did this and later found out all his other girlfriends went through the same thing. He would try to change us to his taste, but it never worked. We were all compared to each other and other women, never favourably and always with the caveat that it was \u201cjust his preference and there\u2019s nothing wrong with preferring certain things\u201d. He said I was insecure when I said it was upsetting to compare my physical traits to random women, he said he was with me so I should realise he obviously loved me.\nThis won\u2019t get better, it will get worse. Unless you want to spend your life feeling like you can never be enough for someone, I would exit this relationship as quickly as you can. Expect love bombing and attempts to keep you, or even him to say no one else will want you. Sending hugs.\n\nEdit:spelling", "NTA - run! This is just the beginning.  I am white and I also have black hair.  After we were married, my now ex-husband would try to get me to dye my hair blonde.  I kept telling him no because I liked my hair color, I would look bad with blond hair, and getting black hair to blonde would be a very time consuming expensive process that I would constantly have to touch up and it would ruin my hair.  We would fight all the time.  I finally asked him why he married me if he wanted to change me. He would act like it was no big deal since it was just hair color.  Then he would try to tell me what clothes I could wear, how to do my makeup, where I was allowed to go and with who.  The controlling kept getting worse and worse. He ended up having an affair with a very young woman who he could control better, we divorced, and I lived happily ever after without him.", "NTA.
