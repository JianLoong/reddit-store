We have two boys (15 & 8). \n\nOur eldest son is very shy and reserved, he likes to read and play video games a lot. He really dislikes playing sports but his father, dismayed that these pursuits did not come naturally to him, insisted that he take it up and keep at it. I decided not to get involved when he would make decisions like that because at the time I just felt that a boy needs a father\u2019s guidance sometimes, and I figured it\u2019s a good thing for him to keep active instead of being cooped up after school.\n\nA few months ago, we found out that he was being targeted by a couple of older boys. They would befriend him, and often intimidate him to do horrible things, some of which included stealing from us and giving it to these boys. This was the first time I saw my husband blow up at our son, while I agree that this was no small matter, my husband\u2019s approach of mocking him about how weak he is wasn\u2019t going to make anything better, he seemed to be most angry that his son could be \u2018coerced\u2019 into something. He had no compassion for his son who has little friends and was desperate to fit in and no understanding that he was clearly an easy target.\n\nNow from that moment on I noticed how much more insistent my husband was that our son toughen up, he would spend a lot of time trying to teach him how to fight and after school he would often ask if anyone \u2018messed with him\u2019 and then he would ask him to say exactly what he would do if they did. I took all this in as a typical father/son thing but was a little upset seeing how invested my son became in pleasing his dad, I felt like he was losing sight of himself. \n\nRecently my husband was involved in a fit of road rage with another driver, which is typical of him but this time was pretty intense. What surprised me though was that he turned his anger to my son, he wasn\u2019t happy that he had stayed silent during that exchange, and for the rest of the ride he went on a tirade about how much of a disappointment our son was. I defended my son of course and told him point blank that he shouldn\u2019t be trying to change our son into something that he is not, and when we went home he blamed me for our son being the way he is, he seems to think he is like this because I was too soft on him.

The reason I think that is because it is *extremely* rare for a man to to be this psychologically abusive toward his children without being psychologically abusive to his partner as well. That being said, I highly recommend you read the book \u201cWhy Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\u201d By Lundy Bancroft. I think you\u2019ll find it very eye-opening, as it sounds like you don\u2019t recognize that your husband is abusive. \n\nSecond, did you know that psychological abuse has longer-lasting (and often \u201cworse\u201d) effects than physical abuse? In some cases, the effects of psychological abuse are even more severe than the effects of sexual abuse. I want you to think about that for a moment OP. The type of harm your husband is inflicting might be more damaging than him *molesting* your child. Do you realize how serious that is? \n\nThis brings me to my third and most important point. Your son is going to have long-lasting mental health problems because of the abuse he\u2019s endured. I apologize for how blunt that sounds. That\u2019s just how brains work - repeated trauma causes the brain to re-wire so that it\u2019s *always* prepared for danger and people do some fucked up things to cope with that. He might end up with PTSD, or depression, or addictions\u2026 but it will be *something*. If you want to combat this, you need to get your son into therapy. Now. Your son\u2019s brain has been repeatedly (and semi-permanently) damaged by your husband, and if you want *any* chance of him leading a healthy life, he needs therapy. Lots of it. \n\nFinally, I hope you consider therapy for yourself as well OP. If I\u2019ve interpreted your post correctly, you\u2019ve been abused for a long time and you likely weren\u2019t aware of it. You\u2019re going to need professional help if you want to start untangling that. I know it\u2019s expensive, but many clinicians offer sliding scales to help with cost. Group therapy is also a good option - it tends to be cheaper and you\u2019ll have built-in social support with the group.", "If I was you, take your kids, get the fuck out of there and file for divorce.", "It\u2019s always safer to leave an abuser than to stay with one.", "So is the lifelong trauma of dealing with an abusive parent"]}
