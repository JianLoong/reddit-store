Jane is essentially the only mother your sister has known, and it is completely understandable that she would grab onto that and hold tight.  You each have your own different experiences and different griefs, and you are punishing her because her experience and grief is different from yours.\n\nEdited to add: As for the significance to her of particular pieces of your mom\u2019s jewelry, your sister\u2019s only real experience of her mother is photos and other people\u2019s stories because, again, she was two.

This whole family except OP is skewed.", "What are the chances that her \u201cdear mom\u201d sold the pieces?", "I am wondering this same thing.", "Yess! I\u2019m like just go get it back? What the isssueee??", "I'm mad I had to travel this far to find this thought.\n\nWhy don't Norah and Jane lend/give your sister one of the pieces that she gave them? It sounds like there were quite a few.", "Or even ask for it to be returned. It wasn't right for stepmom to take and keep those pieces. It's pretty clear Jane was being manipulated in some way (the bracelet incident makes it clear). As an adult, she should confront the step mother about this and get the jewelry back rather than going after OP.", "This!", "Which, even if the jewelry wasn't sentimentally important to OP and impossible to replace in that sense, who gives away jewelry they borrowed??? If somebody lends something to me, I take care of it way better than I care for any of my personal things and *give it back when I'm done*.", "If she wants to wear her mom's jewelry, she can go ask her mom, since she considers Jane to be her mom anyway. Why does she want something from OPs mom?", "The incident with the lending and then giving it away was graduation, so presumably at least 18. \n\nI think Jane is far more of an asshole here than sister, but sister is old enough to understand why she can't be trusted with being loaned jewelry anymore.", "I think asking for a deposit would be a mistake as they could consider that as a payment for keeping the necklace.", "Which begs the question of WHY OP's sister wants to borrow her birth mom's jewellery? If birth mom doesn't matter to the point that OP's sister is fully willing to believe that Jane is her \"REAL\" mom, why is she asking OP for it?", "I hope OP has her jewelry locked up somewhere her sister can\u2019t find it. I\u2019d watch that necklace like a hawk, maybe even stop wearing it for now. As painful as that may be, it\u2019s better than having it forcibly \u201cborrowed\u201d.", "Exactly, and Jane should never have accepted the other jewelry in the first place. No decent person would have, so shame on her.", "Well, she hasn't asked new mom for a necklace because even though she hasn't asked she already knows that this sharing thing only works one way.", "Yeah, there's no way this woman didn't con this kid into giving her the jewelry... Prove you love me, sweetie...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder how valuable this jewelry is.", "while this may be true, Jane seems to have brainwashed her a bit. Why would any human being who marries a widower with children and then tells those children that their biological mother was not their real mom...(and that she was some what...alien?) that was just there a few years until she died and Jane comes to save the sister.. not OP!!! Only the sister..\n\nThe sister has some real issues, the father is blind to all this! And Jane is just being a manipulative b.", "Oh, I am totally thinking she got conned into it, the little girl or teen desperately trying to be the \"good\" girl, to prove what a real daughter and sister she is.", "Not that it makes a difference about OP being T A, but same as you, wondering how old she was when she got the jewelry, why her \u201cnew mom\u201d thought it was appropriate to let her give it away, and why she wouldn\u2019t be able to get it back.", "I'm willing to bet that the jewellery given to Jane was sold because she didn't want anything of OP and her sister's Mum in the house.", "She can't. If she asks the stepmother, the stepmother will take it as her not considering her the REAL mother. Which defeats the purpose of desperately trying to please her by giving her all of her mother's jewelry.", "... that was an incredibly fucked up thing for Jane to have said literally ever, to anyone. What on earth is this comment?", ">I don't know when this was said but frankly your sister had no connection with biological mom beyond stories and pictures. And your post comes across as you looking down on her for that.\n\nI think I gotta sit this one out because that exact dynamic existed in my family. My grandfather, a toddler when his mother died, never shared in his older brother's grief and loved the woman who raised him as his mother. It was something my great-uncle held against him -- but my grandfather was two when she died. I don't know whether or not he said anything, but I do know he was very protective of his mother. I don't know. I wonder about other POVs on this scenario.", "How does all this make the sister TA?", "[deleted]", "If Jane is her mom she can borrow Jane's jewelry for her wedding. Maybe even some of the \"pretty jewelry with no sentimental value\" that Jane had no trouble taking from a child. OP isn't punishing anyone, she lent jewelry before and had trouble getting it back. It's not punishment to stop lending things to people who either don't take care of it or don't return it, it's common sense.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like OP is punishing her.\n\nBorrow something important to your sister and give it away? Don\u2019t get surprised that they will never give you something else in the future", "Agree. OP sounds like she is angry with her sister for being a \"traitor\" to their birth mother, and is using this opportunity to punish sister. Reading between the lines, sounds like OP has isolated herself from the other 3 women in the family. Sad that she is being petty about letting her sister wear it for *one* day, and it's turned an experience that could have been bonding to one that's further driving them apart.", "Right & why did Dad let this happen?? Not cool.", "Yup definitely. She should ask for the jewelry to be returned.", "Agree. It says a lot about Jane that she accepted the jewelry. Jane could have said, \"Thank you. I appreciate the gesture, but the jewelry is yours to keep.\"\n\nAny decent, respectful person would have done that.", "Completely agree. If OP\u2019s sister gave it all away by graduation then I\u2019m assuming she gave it away before she hit 18, and probably didn\u2019t understand the importance it could have to her later in life.\n\nHowever OP is definitely NTA for refusing to lend her sister the necklace. She has proven she will not honour OP\u2019s wishes and give it straight back afterwards. And she proved that at an age where she was old enough to understand what she was doing.\n\nThe sister needs to ask Jane and Norah for pieces she can wear. \n\nAlso where does the Dad stand in all this? He seems like an AH for not stepping in to stop the sister from giving stuff away, or the steps from taking it IMO.", "I bordered if it was legal.  It was her willed inheritance.  She was a minor", "And where is the jewellery NOW? Why can't OP's sister borrow the jewellery she gave to Jane, for her special occasions? Did Jane sell it or something?", "Especially since she views Jane as her mom.", "OP's sister gave the jewelry that she originally got from her birthmom to both her stepmom and stepsis. Granted stepsis was a child then but is an adult now and responsible for retaining them.", "LOL. When the glove fits.", "Yeah either pawned off or turned into other jewelry", "Someone who has been manipulated as a child to believe that they have an obligation to do this. I have serious doubts about what was said to sister to prompt her to give away not only jewellery that was her inheritance, but loaned jewellery too.", "Yeah I am blown away that any of this is even happening. I am so confused. You don\u2019t just give away people\u2019s stuff that you borrowed. I wouldn\u2019t trust her with borrowing ANYTHING, much less family jewelry.", "Yes, but the OP references she already gave away all the jewellry that she (the sister) had recieved. If that happened when the sister was say 10, then some serious bullying was coming from Jane.", "Expect Jane raised the sister from the age of 3.\n\nA 2 year old loses her mum and ends up with a crazy stepmother a year later. That girl doesn't know what a healthy relationship looks like.", "While this is true, it would still require sister to accept that she was manipulated by the only person she's thought of as a mother. I can see why it's easier for go after OP than confront that terrible truth. Doesn't make it right and certainly makes her the AH.", "She didn't accept. She guilted, shamed, and bullied her into \"sharing\" it or otherwise manipulated her position as the only mother figure in sister's life to steal it from her.", "I think it's the age thing - OP was 6 when her mom died, 7 when her dad remarried...  sister was 2 and 3 and had Norah (witt whom sister had more in common than with her older sister) and Jane realized that she had little chance of making OP her daughter, so she didn't care and focused on sister\n\nAbout father - it seems that he was just too happy to have someone's help to raise his two daughters to realize how toxic his new wife was (still is).", "Exactly my thoughts. It doesn't change the fact the sister's made some bad choices, but you gotta wonder at people who willingly keep jewelry from a person's deceased parents and don't even try to give it back. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if it turned out she gave those pieces away as a little kid who didn't fully realise what she was doing, or was manipulated into doing it (\"if you loved mommy you'd give your sister that boring old necklace\", \"I'm your mother now, you don't need anything from that other woman\"). \n\nIt may also explain why she gave OP's bracelet to the other sister. She's been conditioned to give those pieces to them when they asked/demanded. Again, it's not an excuse, but being so young, she may still be heavily under their sway.", "I have no idea and it's dropped in the post with zero explanation which is just plain weird.", "She borrowed jewelry and didn't return it, and deliberatly gave it away. That makes her an asshole.", "The getting married sister borrowed jewelry and refused to return it once.  Those actions mean she doesn't get to borrow again. She can borrow and wear other pieces she had possession of and gave away.", "Why can\u2019t she have two mothers?", "By OP\u2019s admission, the feud goes back longer than that.", "She tried lending her sister something before for \u201cone\u201d day. It turned into a months long battle for her to get her jewelry back. \n\nI feel for OP\u2019s sister, who was probably manipulated into giving her own jewelry to her step-mom and sister, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect OP to be responsible for fixing that mistake or to put her own jewelry at risk. \n\nOP\u2019s step-mom should return the Jane\u2019s pieces to her so that she has something to wear at her wedding.", "Exactly! His wife is taking advantage of his kids and where is he during all this?", "Either the dad is very aloof orrrr very well taken care of....ahem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor... just very well manipulated by her. As we can see the step-mom is capable.", "This sounds kind a like a cinderella story IMO.\nEvil step mom and sis taking advantage of the biological daughter(s). When one is a doormat and just gives away everything of hers.", "Like stepmom/sis would actually give it back", "I can't help but wonder if the jewelry is still around.  I wouldn't be surprised if the step mother pawned it.", "I mean, no decent person would say birthmom - who DIED - was a \"stand in\" until her \"real mom\" could step in. That was pure evil.", "Jane and dad are responsible for this mess.", "This was my thought. She gave it all to Jane etc., why not ask this \"real mom\" to lend it back to her for the special occasion?", "Absolutely, and that was messed up. But again, after the last incident with lending sister jewelry she doesn't have any ground to stand on that it would be responsible or reasonable to lend her anything else.\n\nI think a lot of not good stuff went down in this family, but on this front alone there is absolutely no reasonable way to say she should be trusted with a loan.", "Sure there was, but giving Jane the jewellry borrowed from OP is not.\n\nNo-one should give away something to someone else which does not belong to them.", "We don't know that the stepmother is crazy. We're getting one perspective here, from someone who resented the stepmother. \n\nIt sounds like everyone needs to stop talking about jewelry and start talking to a family therapist", "She could but she gave all her jewelry from one mom to the other mom so when it comes to wearing jewelry from her mom on her wedding day she only has one mom to wear the jewelry of.", "And? The bracelet situation proves that OP is willing to let her sister borrow jewelry despite their issues. But, the bracelet situation proves she cannot trust her sister to return the jewelry, which is why she isn\u2019t letting her borrow the necklace now.", "And OP was willing to put that behind them when she leant her the jewellery for graduation, and she got burned for it. Makes sense to not make the same mistake twice", "Yup unfortunately I don't see that happening easily.", "Which begs the question of WHY OP's sister wants to borrow her birth mom's jewellery?

She could have been 5 for all week know.  And you really can\u2019t see the difference in sentimental value between some random pair of earrings you have zero connection with other than someone telling you that your mother wore them at some point, and a necklace you\u2019ve seen for years in your mother\u2019s wedding photos?", "I already acknowledged that was a jerk move by the sister.  They both have a hand in how much the relationship has broken down over the years.\n\nBut this sub tends to struggle with the idea that both parties can be right or wrong.  It\u2019s easier to just pick a villain.", "I can sort of understand. Wanting a connection with bio parent is almost built in into everybody, even most people with really bad parents will wish for some connection.", "Who said the mother wore it on her wedding day? OP wore it on her wedding day and the mom is wearing it in unspecified photos. The mom is quite possibly wearing other jewelry in photos since she liked it and had quite a bit, jewelry Jane has some of and can lend the sister for her wedding.", "Sister isn\u2019t a villain in my book, but OP sure as hell isn\u2019t an AH.\n\nIf the sister wants her mom\u2019s jewelry to wear, there is a simple solution, ask Jane.", "It still reeks of wanting your cake and eating it, too on OP's sister's part.", "You\u2019re right, minor error, the necklace was only her mom\u2019s favorite that she wore in lots of photos.
