Jane is essentially the only mother your sister has known, and it is completely understandable that she would grab onto that and hold tight.  You each have your own different experiences and different griefs, and you are punishing her because her experience and grief is different from yours.\n\nEdited to add: As for the significance to her of particular pieces of your mom\u2019s jewelry, your sister\u2019s only real experience of her mother is photos and other people\u2019s stories because, again, she was two.

Still unhappy with myself about it, especially as I lost lots of photographs that I had intended to scan but never did.

And maybe she's insecure and threatened by your relationship with your father. It's cliched but still very possible. \n\nThe reason I'm saying all this is, you're right to be cautious.

It's hard not to think maybe she was the favourite child then. So if that's been a part of the family story, it may have influenced how your sister regards the jewellery she got from your Mom. Her jewellery is lesser than yours, she also got less time with your Mom, so the whole thing may feel painful for her and not something to treasure. \n\nIncidentally - how do you know that was your Mom's favoured piece? \n\nAnyway it's possible that with age and life experience your sister might one day see things differently than she does now.

It is very possible she has already asked for the jewelry back and it is gone.\n\nI think you should be charitable and give her the necklace to wear, it would be a way to mend fences, give a way for your mother to be present at the wedding, and give something that you can share as sisters.

It's not YOUR wedding day.  If it was me I would want my sibling to be as happy as possible on her wedding day, even if it meant I didn't get to wear my favourite jewelry that day.  Honestly if I was your sister and you said no I would tell you not to come.\n\nEdit: apparently I missed the bracelet debacle.  If there are trust issues you could make her sign a contract maybe?  Or come up with some other compromise?", "ESH. I could be getting this wrong, your sister was 2 when your mother died? I doubt she even remembers her bio mother's face without looking at a photo the same way you might.\nMakes sense she wouldn't have really understood the sentiment of the jewelry for all her childhood and teenage life.\nSounds like you and your sister have bonding issues because she abandon your mother and you didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if you unknowingly held that against her most her life.\n I my opinion give her the necklace, why? I would think your bio mother wouldn't want you and your sister fighting and you will both have photos of each other wearing it, even if it's lost.\nI think it is honestly a nicer way to honour your mother than holding on to a piece of jewellery.", "ESH.

You refused to let them borrow pieces from you (despite no evidence they wouldn't return them).

The same sister who also did not apologize and also thought her own sister was shitty for trying to get her Bracelet back? Like yes some it happened when they were young.

And if they have to ultimately admit to selling the jewelry, then OP's position of not wanting to let them \"borrow\" the jewelry is that much stronger.

And if the sister won't sign it, then it would be clear that she has no intention of giving it back.", "If her sister doesn't return it, she should definitely do it.", "OP is married adult, so I think they are already away from their reach.", "My concern with even that is that she would refuse to give it to me and say I would get it back the next day. Or that she would find a way to give it to Jane or Norah during the wedding. She has never been remorseful for giving Jane the bracelet I let her borrow. She still stands by her actions with that and thinks I'm wrong for taking it off Jane.", "OP has asked about the jewelry before, and was told it was \"none of her business\".\n\nRegarding the bracelet, the dad was in Jane's side, so no way he would defend OP's if they got their hands on the necklace.", "OP was not responsible for her sisters actions. The father on the hand has failed his children.", "I hold her actions at 18 against her. When she gave the bracelet to Jane which was not hers to give.", "The sister giving away her own jewelry isn\u2019t why OP won\u2019t loan her the necklace. It\u2019s the fact that when OP previously loaned their mothers jewelry to her sister, the sister GAVE it to their stepmom. Stepmom then only returned it when threatened with escalating to law enforcement. She did THAT when she was 18.", "Her dad caters to his wife and step daughter, and that is also a problem when it came down to OP refusing to give away her inherited jewelry to people she has good reason to distrust.\n\nBut nah, that's just only OP having excessive personal animosity and be unable to cope right? She should be grateful Norah and Jane wanted to be her new family after all! /s", "Did anyone talk about why she can get the jewellery back ? Like did the stepmom and stepsister sold it ? Why isn't it there for her to wear on her wedding day ?", "NTA.   Please keep the jewellery safe somewhere where they can't get hold of it.\n\nOne question from me if that's ok? We know that Dad didn't say anything to Jane or her daughter  regarding the the jewellery, but where are the grandparents/maternal family in all of this and what's their opinion \ud83e\udd14.   I can't imagine they would be too thrilled with this situation, would they?", "Aloof? I'd say raging asshole personall,. Considering he just allowed his shiny new wife and stepdaughter to take the jewelry in the first place.", "She can't compete with deceased mom so she's trying to erase her from existence. I'll eat my hat if OP's sister's jewelry is still in step mom's possession. SM definitely pawned that stuff. Or threw it off a bridge.", "That's exactly what I think happened", "This sub is so funny lmao \n\nOP is clearly NTA but this comment is just pure, baseless conjecture", "Hm..practical and affordable!", "Please don\u2019t lend your necklace to your sister. They seem like awful people.", "Please be very, very careful about this! I let a family member borrow a sentimental piece of jewelry and they refused to give it back! When I tried to take legal action, I was advised because I freely gave it to her they could not force her to give it back. I cut complete contact with that side of the family. Looking back I wish I had pushed harder and hired an attorney.", "That\u2019s what I meant, just hadn\u2019t had enough coffee yet \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI would pay to see Jane\u2019s face if she thought she had the real one but found out it was a cheap fake lol", "I\u2019m so sorry that you can\u2019t trust your dad to back you up \ud83d\ude1f", "Hi OP, many asked already, why can't she have the piece that were left for her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, many hinted at the possibility that your step family abused emotionally. Is it possible that they forced her to give away the pieces?", "Wait, she's called you an AH for taking back the bracelet from Jane that you let your sister borrow? What is her logic behind that? \n\nYou really need to like, write a letter or see a therapist or something. It seems you guys have a ton of really weird things between you that are never said.", "Sounds like OP made the same decision despite Jane raising her for twice as long as her bio mom", "Either the monetary value or the weird obsession she has with being their only mother. If she steals all the evidence that their mother existed, it\u2019s easier for her to assert that she\u2019s their \u201creal\u201d mom.", "Exactly. Why isn\u2019t Jane giving her something special to wear for her wedding? Or at least lending sis the stuff from the \u201cstand-in\u201d that she gave to Jane?", "Because it's nice and stepmom and stepsis want it and she's in their thrall.", "YES! Who would do this? Who would take child's only memory of her dead Mother? This is like comic book villain level stuff. She was an adult woman who knew what she was doing. Where the hell is this kid's Dad in all this? So sick.", "... and married 1 year after her mom died...\n\nI'm not one to judge how others mourn, but, that's fast.", "Glad someone brought the mistake to my attention.", "I think it's a fair assumption, based purely on how those characters were represented by OP.", "Other commenters have suggested getting a replica of the necklace and let sister borrow it without knowing it's not the original.\n\nIf, after the wedding, the replica is not returned, or if someone makes a HUGE fuss about it not being the real jewelry, OP will know that the replica was handed over to \"someone\" and that \"someone\" got it appraised.", "I'm not sure why.\n\nShe has always said she chose to do it. But that doesn't mean she didn't feel like she should or like she had to.", "Tale as old as time!!!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "My suspicion is step mom is afraid she won't get it back OR it was sold/pawned long ago... and not for younger sister's benefit.", "This is so absolutely true unless stepmother really is super evil and controlling!", "Because now it's theirs and THEY WON'T SHARE.", "Maybe selfish enough to encourage OP's sister's request for the necklace in hopes she would then give the necklace to her, just like she did with the bracelet.", "Steps want it and are leaning on the sister in subtle/not so subtle ways with \"no take backs\" and \"oh it's so bad that you have nothing from bio mom, poor you, it's sooooo sad.\"", "Naah, the sister very likely has no conscience of being manipulated since childhood. She thinks the necklace is pretty and that after the wedding she can give it to Jane and make her happy (and maybe even Jane has voiced about \"what a pretty necklace your sister has, you should borrow it from her\").", "Thanks for being gracious about it", "I mean, unless the stepmother didn't actually say that, it's pretty damning.", "INFO: Has Jane ever used those words before, \"share with the family\", when badgering you about stuff like your mom's jewelry or anything else when you were younger? Just curious if those were truly your sister's ideas/words or if she was parroting someone...", "Any normal step mom would have saved your late moms jewelry for you two when you're getting 18. And I cannot believe your dad. I really hope, your man will be a better dad than yours, cause obviously he doesn't give a fuck. Why does your sister want to wear a bracelet of a person who doesn't exist in her opinion? If Jane is her \"real\" mom, she should borrow one of Jane's.", "I would have told my sister to borrow a necklace from Jane", "I don't think she thinks she made a mistake. She still made comments about OP putting their birth mom on a pedestal and other comments. I can't imagine why she can't get back one piece that she gave away. I mean that's her \"real\" mom right? Go ask your \"real\" mom...(btw I was being sarcastic lol)", "Betting it starts with \"P\" and ends with \"awn shop\"", "But if Jane is soooo goood \"real mum\", why can't she borrow these pieces from her? This is the most illogical thing here.", "I think the father is more at fault than Jane personally. What kind of shitty father do you have to be to just roll over and allow your shiny new wife to bully your child into giving up jewelry. He fucking disgusts me for not standing up for his children.", "Also consider the possibility that you\u2019d never get the jewelry back once she got possession of it.", "As a 17/18 year old at their graduation, she immediately crossed OP\u2019s VERY REASONABLE BOUNDARY  and gave the bracelet to Jane. The only reason she wants the necklace is to give it to Jane. She doesn\u2019t deserve to wear the necklace since she clearly gives zero craps about her birth mother.", "There might be some resentment towards OP too, for having these memories and connection that she doesn't. Not OP's fault in any way of course, but may be influencing the sister's behaviour.", "Like playing monopoly with a 5 yr old. They think they\u2019re doing good when they trade you properties so you can buy houses.", "Exactly.  Borrow one of mom's pieces back from Jane or Nora   If they still have them.", "I\u2019m guessing she heard that a lot from S- mom", "In theory let\u2019s say he\u2019s grieving, but definitely he\u2019s the first one at fault. That poor wife, dying and your spouse not even trying to preserve your memory.", ">desperately looking for love and validation from the only mother she could really remember\n\nShe is still doing that now, since she gave OP's bracelet to Jane too.", "It sounds like they were nice pieces of jewelry as well."]}
