Fucking dirtbags.", "You should suggest to the pharmacy that they limit purchases. Ours has been due to the shortage.", "NTA especially if this is in the USA there is such a shortage. So many people are getting sick right now and need it. My husband had to get some because he was getting sick and there was one just one packet left.", "NTA.\n\nIf everyone did this, it would create an artificial scarcity. This is the reason no one could find decently priced toilet paper in 2020.", "NTA, A couple of weeks ago my 4yr old got sick and was spiking a fever of 103. We had to go to 6 stores to find a bottle of Tylenol. Some people suck!", "NTA. There's a huge international shortage and people like that deserve to be called out", "NTA in the uUK you can only purchase one packet of cold and flu medicines per checkout to stop people doing things like this.", "NTA. They were questioned and they didn't have a legitimate reason for hoarding. They said they were \"just preparing\". Creating unnecessary shortages for medicine is as asshole a move as there is.", "NTA\n\nIt's a shame that medical needs are already expensive and some medications can go out of stock, such as Theraflu.\n\nAlso makes me think of the baby formula shortage and people buying out the whole shelf.", "NTA. I\u2019m a nurse. Our pediatric units are overwhelmed nationwide. We currently are having a shortage of medicines for kids and it\u2019s starting in on adult meds too. Even antibiotics are being rationed. Bottom line. No one needs more than 2. Period. Anyone buying them much medicine is an asshole contributing to societies problems in 1 of 2 ways. Making the shortage worse or making meth. 30 pkgs my happy ass. Unnecessary.", "NTA but why didn't the store have limits posted?", "ESH - the people hoarding medication suck for being inconsiderate AHs at a time when people can\u2019t find these medications for themselves/their sick children. And you kind of suck for joining in on a crowd. There are much nicer ways of dealing with this than in a crowd of people.", "YTA\nIt\u2019s none of your business if the pharmacy doesn\u2019t have a limit.\nI realized this month that I had a ton of money in my FSA and went ham at Walgreens buying a years work of OTC meds, feminine products, etc. I\u2019m sure I looked like a hoarder but no one said anything rude to me.", "YTA\n\nThey were breaking no laws. The store did not have limit of how many they could buy. You don't know if they were hoarding or going to give away or donate said items.  \nThey could be on their way to a homeless shelter, women's shelter or a food bank with them.\n\nMerry fucking Christmas to you and the mob you joined.", "NTA, but this is why I oppose price gouging laws during shortages. If stores cannot dramatically raise prices in a shortage, the rational thing for any individual to do in a shortage is to clear the store as there is no downside to hoarding.", "NTA. There\u2019s a med shortage right now. No way they should be stockpiling. Good job stepping up.", "YTA\n\nIf a whole grocery store only has 30 packs of cold medicine in stock, that\u2019s on the store.\n\nIt\u2019s no business of yours what another customer purchases.  There are plenty of people who stock up in bulk when things are on sale.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way you really need dozens of packs of medicine\u201d you don\u2019t know them.  I grew up in a house of 6 people with horrible allergies and sinus issues - if one of us caught a cold, we *all* caught the cold.  And the amount of tissues and cold meds we would go through as a household would probably shock you.\n\nInstead of buying tissues and meds and other nonperishables \u201cas needed\u201d, my family and a lot of others stock up so we are ready before hand.\n\n\u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be buying that many\u201d why?  Because you don\u2019t like it?", "NTA. My local grocery store has limits per person for purchases of children\u2019s and adults cold and flu medicine and related pain medication. If they needed so many they can split up the purchase and go to another store.", "YTA - When the pandemic started, I went to Costco and bought 8 large packs of toilet paper about 48 rolls each and got criticized. One for me, one for my parents, and six were for seniors at my moms church who had pre-existing medical conditions and were afraid to go shopping. Sometimes you don't know.", "YTA It is up to the store to set limits. Not you.", "YTA. I have an above average number of kids and if they're all sick at the same time for multiple days it takes 6-8 bottles of baby advil bc its for 3 and under and I have 4 of those and has like 5 doses in a box, or about a day and a half for a wee one, so what am I supposed to do to get through a 5 day sickness except have 15 fucking bottles of Tylenol?", "YTA. As long as the store doesn\u2019t have a limit, anyone can buy as much of anything as they want. It\u2019s none of your business what they\u2019re going to do with it. Maybe they\u2019re going to donate it to the food pantry or some other worthy charity. Besides, as you pointed out, there was still flu medicine left for others.", "YTA. \n\nWho made you the decider of what medicines people need & in what quantity? \n\nYou have no idea why they were buying it. \n\nIt\u2019s in the store. It\u2019s theirs to buy. Maybe they\u2019re giving it as Christmas gifts (my mom does lol) or maybe they\u2019re donating it.", "YTA is the end of the year.  They may be using up their FSA.", "YTA. If the store is allowing people to hoard, that's on them. As such, there is a shortage right now, and I know of a few people who are bulk buying to give to other's because they can't get some.", "NTA. They're making meth with those supplies.", "YTA. \n\nThis is weird. Stay out of people\u2019s shopping carts. Even if they were intending to sell it, what\u2019s it to you? \n\nNext time ask yourself: \u201cIs it worth getting punched in the face over something this stupid?\u201d Cause people love to meet crazy with crazy.", "YTA. Some people buy it to send to their relatives back home. I once helped a former coworker purchase medications to send to her family in Venezuela. Learn to kind your business. You\u2019ll live a happier, longer life.", "YTA. What other people buy or why is not your business. It's really no more complicated than that. You don't get to judge and decide things for other people based on no information and just your own ideas and assumptions.", "YTA. Also, you may see me doing this at some point. I\u2019m often required to do this for work when we run out. We\u2019re supposed to keep it on hand and occasionally I have to go buy a bunch because we run out unexpectedly. It\u2019s nothing nefarious, employees occasionally ask for a headache tablet, tampons, etc, so I go buy it. So sorry for annoying you trying to take care of employees. Mind your business.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your business. They may have a big extended family, they may do donations.\n\nIf there's a problem, it's up to the shop staff take care of it, not to you.", "YTA. Who are you, the medicine police?", " YTA mind your business. If someone wants to buy 30 retail priced items good for them. The store roll restock within a couple days max.", "NTA - A lot of people are making excuses as to why these people might need all this medicine but the bottom line is they are either over preparing and dont need it or they were under prepared and have to get it all now. Either way they messed up and everyone else has to pay the price.", "YTA\nSeriously.\nThe only good reason I would accept is that they looked like methheads. You have made no such suggestion. Most methheads are not going to stick around to pay, particularly as a couple. I cannot wait to downvote every comment suggesting such. It's pennies on the dollar over the border. It's not a smart business move to pay retail. \nIt's the store's responsibility to stock enough for the community. That's why you pay for the product. IF the store even had to purchase the stock, it's less than what you bought it for. With it being cold season, they should have stocked up.", "YTA. Mind your own business. Don't jump on a bandwagon without knowing where it's going. They could be shopping for others who can't go out, or have a large family, or any number of things that are none of your business.", "Is noone thinking about the drugs angle.
