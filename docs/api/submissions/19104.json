Also, I spared almost no pleasantries with the man when I entered the conversation. I made an assessment quickly that this person was being disingenuous.... and in contrast to my GF's assessment, I took initiative and responded for both of us without collaboration to what I felt was a rude sales tactic masked as politeness. With that gesture, in her eyes, I had both shut down what she believed was an honest conversation, while simultaneously implying that she is naive.

Not at ALL!! 100% they \"Were Selling!\" That whole \"We just want you to have the info\" is the \"Lead in Line to the Sales Pitch.\" Complete BS. Especially since 1) you had a No Solicitors Sign (Yes, they WERE soliciting) 2) You asked him nicely & he persisted.\n\nYour GF is TAH sorry. NOT you. I did B2B & Door to Door sales for years. You 100% were getting \"Set up for the pitch, & the \"Lead Guy\" was TRAINING his colleagues on \"How to do it!\" \n\nSorry, but if your GF can't see THAT?? Maybe not the brightest bulb in the chandelier? They WERE Selling, you just didn't let them get far enough to \"give you the pitch.\" Definitely NTA!!", "NTA They are absolutely selling something. You don't even have to answer the door or ever say more than no, so you already went above and beyond. I also find it insulting that they asked if you the man (?) might know more, but that's just me", "NTA.  We have pest control, window,  and roof companies that do this and its crap.  Our area requires a permit to go door to door so they stop by to \"just let you know we're in the area\". They get my dogs riled up while im trying to work and when I ignore them they stay there knocking and waiting for a long time.  They're persistent and conveniently never have a card to leave and want to come back later when im not busy.  I can't stand companies that sell like that.  \n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NTA. They are soliciting but hiding behind weasel-wording to give themselves plausible deniability. I don't even open the door if I see some unknown person that showed up without prior communication.

I would never open the door for 5 people! And it's true, nothing is free. You probably have to pay upfront and get reimbursed by the state. Good riddance because there is   \nNO Soliciting!", "NAH (other than solar salespeople!). As far as moving forward since your gf was upset, let her waste time with door-to-door salespeople, informational pitches, religious recruiters, whatnot.

Same with lawn services. \"I'm just being nice, and not selling anything at all, but buy our stuff.

If she'd been looking for help and they wouldn't take a hint, being rude would be justified. But you basically interrupted her conversation to tell them to get lost. \n\nThe issue isn't if they broke a rule that justified being rude.

They were most definitely lying, and they're selling solar panels. You were completely well within your rights and not even rude. Direct maybe. Most people aren't even as nice as you were.", "Ehhhh. I'm gonna say NTA. My only qualm maybe is you could've just said, \"I'm not interested in this conversation\" and left again. But the salesperson and your gf shouldn't have tried to pull you back in when you clearly walked away. Maybe have a conversation with gf that when you walk away in those situations, you don't want to be pulled back in unless she wants help shutting it down and maybe come up with a signal or something for that unless she says she's not concerned or worried about shutting it down if she wants to. \n\nI don't agree with any of the comments saying gf didn't have a handle on it nor do I agree with any of the comments saying you took control of the conversation. I think your initial response of leaving her to it and walking away initially was respectful in both respects of her being co-tenant and handling the conversation. \n\nThe salespeople definitely shouldn't have tried to pull you back in. They should've taken the hint when you walked away that there wasn't going to be a mutual agreement on the sale or at most left info for y'all to discuss amongst yourselves, but at that point of pulling you back in they're prodding and being ultra-invasive. \n\nI'm sure it's explicitly on the door or something but for argument's sake, let's say they didn't notice the sign. Once you've pointed it out, end of conversation. Salespeople should've just said, \"oh sorry about that, thank you for your time,\" and just left. Not to mention the part where they argue back with you about it being a sales pitch, c'mon. Drop. It. \n\nPersonally I went for one of the solar panel pitches. I know how to fish out bs in those conversations and I'm happy with what I got. That said, ofc it was a sales pitch. The \"incentives\" are a discount (and sometimes it's not decent), a cheaper electric bill, and it adds value to the home (and that only matters to you if you own it), but they're still making a sale. Nobody buys anything unless it has value to them. If I buy hardwood flooring to install to add value to my home, that's an incentive/investment to me, but it still requires a sale. \n\nGf isn't an AH either, though again maybe have a convo about you walking away. The salespeople here were huge AH. I know they can be so pushy and it seems so counterproductive to me. If I do have interest in their product down the line, I'm more likely to reach out to them for the service if my initial experience with them is pleasant and a cordial acceptance of the rejection. Most people either want to do their own research or just don't have the means to drop an investment purchase on the spot. They need to learn that letting it go is part of making a sale and making a good presentation for their company.", "NTA\n\nI have a \"no soliciting\" sign on my door, but most salespeople ignore it.\n\nWhich is why I also have a camera there and ignore them.", "\\>in the area doing work for our neighbors\n\nI always hear that line.  You can make the squirm a bit.  Ask them who the neighbor is and what's the neighbor's address.", "NTA. So your girlfriend believes they were just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts?? People who lie to sell shit are the worst. Just own your shit and stop being shady.", "My line is this.\n\n\"If I ever need solar panels, I will get them from a company that doesn't solicit.  This conversation has ensured that I will never use your company.\"\n\nI'm presuming this is in Australia.  For those who don't know, spruiking solar panels is a popular (semi) scam in our country.\n\nBasically, the only installers who use this tactic are crap.  Competent, professional companies get all the work they need from people who want solar panels looking up installers themselves.", "NTA", "It's also a very effective sales strategy and one directly taught in many sales courses. I can think of several key influencing strategies they used in this short interaction already - reciprocity, social proof, likeability, authority, commitment and consistency, scarcity. Cialdini's book Influence outlines how each of them works and once you know it you see it everywhere. They hit 6 of the 7 key strategies he outlines, and another one not mentioned in his book re price. They're very good at what they do to get so many in so quickly, it would be incredibly hard for most people to refuse hearing the pitch and committing to at least a follow up call after engaging just to the point they did, let alone if they talked for another 5 minutes. \n\nOP you're NTA, your gf isn't trained in sales techniques and mistook their deliberate tactics as general friendliness which it absolutely was not. I highly recommend you both read the book, it's fascinating and will help her to see why being friendly in that kind of situation isn't the right approach.", "Honestly I don't think they were selling anything. I think they were trying to case the joint.", "Actually we are Tennant's in common. I am majority owner. It was my loan.", "No, the second they started to try to sell something he needed to step in. No soliciting means no soliciting. She didn\u2019t \u201cneed to look for help\u201d when OP was part of the conversation anyway.

She\u2019s just incapable of shutting it down when in the conversation.", "Additionally, 5 people? ASININE. I had 2 people come up for the initial pitch, I told them when the best time was to come back for further conversation so I had time to actually participate in the conversation and ask questions and only 1 guy came back. 5 people seems strategic. They're not paying that many people for less ground coverage without a reason. The reason is to cause confusion.", "I think the way you handled it is perfectly fine with respect to the no solicitation sign. My only question is if you have a right to ban solicitors from the property if you have an owner in common that wants solicitation (for some reason I will never understand).\n\nBe rude to the hawkers for ignoring the sign, but have a discussion with the co-owner about whether solicitation should be banned.", "> GF here is clearly unable to do that.\n\nOr she didn't want to. \n\nIt's controlling and condescending to insist you have to end someone's conversation for them when they don't want to. Saying you can because it's your property is technically correct, but still dismissive and rude to the girlfriend. \n\nAgain, if she had wanted the help, that would be a different issue.", "Well, she and I DO have a 60/40 split on the house with a civil agreement we signed to split equity and mortgage... we are Tennant's in common.", "Different people shut down conversations like this in different ways. Some are very blunt and forward about shutting it down, others will politely decline following a pitch, there\u2019s nothing wrong with either and she wasn\u2019t really given the opportunity to shut this down herself in her way.", "They have a sign that says NO SOLICITING!

No decisions were made, and OP interrupted his gf to make a decision FOR her", "I can understand this, but I would still lean towards leaving her to handle the salesmen at the door if she\u2019s the one actively having a conversation with them.\n\nSome people are really upfront with shutting down salesmen, others will let them pitch and then gently shut them down, if she leans towards the latter being thrown into the former could\u2019ve been really uncomfortable.\n\nBased on what you said your girlfriend said, it sounds like it was the way this was shutdown that upset her, opposed to shutting down salesmen.\n\nI would probably openly ask her if she\u2019s happy dealing with shutting down salesmen like that or if she would prefer for you to intervene, for future reference. There\u2019s always going to be the occasional idiot that ignores a no soliciting sign.", "No, because he was in the conversation!
