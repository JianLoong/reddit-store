One of my bridesmaids found out she was pregnant in December, and has been struggling financially ever since. She\u2019s unemployed, has a boyfriend (M28) who works two jobs, yet they still struggle. \n\nHer and I hung out at my house yesterday and the wedding casually came up in conversation, the baby/nursery/baby shower came up a few times, and then she kept steering conversation back to the wedding. She asked me if we were still doing it out of state, I said yes. She asked how much it would be, I said no more than $400 a couple. I reiterated that guests don\u2019t need to worry about accommodations, food, or transportation. All they need to worry about is plane tickets. \n\nThe wedding has been set in stone for 4 months and she knew all the details already. She\u2019s literally a bridesmaid! The confusion and topic of expenses led me to believe that she had not bought her plane tickets yet, and maybe was asking these questions as a financial reassurance for herself. Then I started realizing that a big trip like this would be financially stressful only 3 months after giving birth, which is what she\u2019d be going through if she was to come, so maybe she was weary about attending overall. \n\nNow this is where I feel I may have been the asshole. I believe I may have assumed far too much. I nicely told her that if she couldn\u2019t make it due to the baby or financial difficulties that I\u2019d completely understand and wouldn\u2019t hold it against her. She immediately got angry, called me a bad friend and started crying.\n\nI was more confused because I thought I was being a good friend. I explained that I didn\u2019t intend to upset her and that I was sorry for clearly hurting her feelings somehow. She then *screamed* that if I was truly her friend, I would want her to come so bad that I\u2019d pay her way, including her plus 2. I was stunned and offended. Important: Back in January I payed her way for my bachelorette trip because she had just found out she was pregnant and I wanted to help out. \nIt was almost like my friendly gesture of paying her way for the trip nipped me in the ass, because now she expects me to pay her way this time. She then storms out of my house and drives away. I woke up to her calling me names like crappy friend, selfish, and judgmental. I\u2019m completely lost for words which has led me here. \n\nAITA for telling my bridesmaid that I understand if she can\u2019t make it to my wedding, ultimately not immediately offering to pay her way like I have before? Though, I feel maybe I should have been more upfront and just asked her why she was asking those questions instead of assuming why.

She was leading you down the garden path, waiting for your response to be that you would pay for her expenses to be at the wedding. \n\nWhen you didn't give her the response she wanted for her performance, she flipped the scenario going for angry guilting instead of pity guilt. You did nothing wrong, but I would give her a time frame for if she is attending or not. If she doesn't respond that counts as no.", "NTA. She started expecting you to bankroll her.

No.", "NTA. to match her ridiculousness, you should've countered with if she was truly *your* friend, she'd want to go so bad she'd figure it out, since you were so kind as to help her with the bachelorette trip and she has months to find a way to pay for one plane ticket.", "Being in a wedding is a HONOR. She shouldn\u2019t expect you to pay that\u2019s just ludacris.. the fact she would take offense to that is even crazier. She will be a brand new mother and everyone knows the financial stress that comes with having babies. You did nothing wrong OP.. NTA", "NTA - I mean, I think that is a generous thing you did telling her not to worry about it if there's too much going on. I've had friends who have done the opposite - knew I was unemployed and struggling and never lifted a finger to help. The fact that you're providing accommodations is beyond kind, and you paid her way for the bach.\n\nUnderstand that she's going through a lot and she's probably embarassed about her current situation. I doubt her reaction was personal, you were the person who happened to point out that you could tell she was struggling, but I think she will come to realize that you said that from a place of care and not a place of judgment. You can't be expected to pay for her to attend the wedding, and you gave her a reasonable alternative.\n\nEdit: whoops I read this wrong -- damn she thought you would pay her way to the wedding and was mad you wouldn't? You were NTA originally here but now your friend is def the AH. I take back what I said - I'm not sure if you should keep this girl in your life.", "NTA you shouldn't be friends with this mooch.", "NTA. She was beating around the bush and waiting for you to offer. Any approach other than \"here, have some money\" would have ended the same way.  And you are not obligated to pay for her. I hate the audacity of people thinking that others somehow \"owe\" them something because they went and had a child they can't afford.", "NTA she wanted you to pay, she was just trying to make you think it was *your* idea. That's why she didn't come out and ask.", "NTA\n\nYou gave your 'friend' an inch by paying for her to attend your bachelorette and she is now expecting the whole mile for your wedding. Rude.\n\nA real friend wouldn't treat you like this. Tell her that if she really thinks that you're such a terrible person, she can consider her invitation rescinded and that she shouldn't expect to hear from you again for a while - if at all.", "NTA. I think some of her reaction may be more hormonal than actual offense (pregnancy will cause that sometimes). Honestly, I would've done the same thing you did, giving her a way out of attending. Because to me, it sounded more like she was struggling with how to tell you she couldn't be in the wedding. For her to expect you to foot the entire bill for her trip was way off base. Give her time to settle down and come to her senses. And I wish you a lovely wedding day.", "Not sure about AH but you should have discussed directly and asked her if she's got any concerns about the upcoming wedding instead of assuming things. She's pregnant so full of crazy hormones, worried about money, probably wanting to support you but then seemed like you didn't care if she was there or not by saying you'd be fine if she didn't come to the wedding. I assume it's out of state for some good reasons but destination weddings are kind of a nightmare for people without disposable income. You two need to have a REAL heart to heart where you both listen to each other instead of assuming things that haven't been said.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I really want her to go too but I have expenses of my own to take care of. The bachelorette trip was hundreds of dollars more than this trip. My fianc\u00e9 and I are putting our money together to make this wedding happen. We\u2019ve waited 2 years to save, picked the most reasonable location, cheaper off peak month, and also reserved and rented a multi bedroom house for everyone to stay in (micro wedding). We\u2019ve put everyone into consideration while planning this wedding and it just breaks my heart that $200 is worth more than our friendship to her.. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d react if she ends up coming anyway.\n\nEdit: additional info, spelling", "I still don't want to do a big trip for a wedding and I'm 30 years post partum.", "I\u2019ve never seen this side of her before so I don\u2019t know how to approach this at all. I\u2019ve known her since middle school and she\u2019s never schemed or been angry like this. Part of me feels bad and worried for her because maybe she\u2019s being effected by her pregnancy hormone levels and doesn\u2019t know how to cope. At the same time, my wedding is coming up and I want to be in a positive mood! The other part of me doesn\u2019t want to deal with her drama. We do have an RSVP date that applies to everyone, so I guess only time will tell.", "You have already covered the cost of everything but  the flights. You've been more than reasonable. Yes she's probably hormonal but her telling you that you would pay all her and her plus 2s way if you were really her friend is out of line. She's trying to guilt you into basically a free trip for her and her plus 2. \n\nAt this point I'd personally be dropping her as a bridesmaid and from the wedding entirely. I might try to talk to her calmly about it and give her a chance to explain first but to be honest I can't see her apologising which is what I'd need for her to stay invited.", "I'm confused how her \"plus 2\" and the cost of plane tickets are related. Specifically in connection with the baby.\n\nAirlines usually don't require a separate ticket for infants so long as the infant is going to sit in their parent's lap. They only require that if you want to be able to put them in a carrier in their own seat (buckled in) or if you're travelling with more lap children than adults.\n\nUnless she wants that third seat, the cost of the tickets should only need to be the cost of the adults.\n\nAnd, frankly, given that factor, even if you were wanting to be generous enough to cover the adult tickets, if she really wants a third seat for the kid, she should pay that part herself.", "I\u2019m no partum and I don\u2019t want to do a big trip for a wedding either.", "NTA.  I have been pregnant myself and affected by \"pregnancy hormones\".  They don't cause you to scheme and manipulate your friends to provide you with money and plane tickets.  Your friend is showing her true colors.  Learn from them.", "You did nothing wrong. You offered her an out if she needed it, and you were not condescending. Her expectation of you paying for her expenses is unreasonable. I would just let her know that while you would love for her to be there, you are unable to pay for her and her guests to attend.  A good friend would accept this. Congratulations to you and enjoy your wedding,  guilt free!", "People change. I also thought I knew my best friend. Turns out I didn't. The faster you come to terms with this, the less advantage they can take of you.", "pregnancy and stress can very much cause her to act like this, but that doesn't really excuse the name calling or the entitlement. I would wash my hands of her until after the wedding, don't let her ruin your day."]}
