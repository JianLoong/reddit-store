Instead of attending the party, use that time to connect with potential better friends. Leave the group chat. You deserve better friendships.", "NTA. If you weren\u2019t there when the plan was made, don\u2019t attend just cause they felt like they had to invite you after you asked them first. Same thing happened with my friend group and I don\u2019t regret not going.", "Yeah fuck that. I wouldn't go. If I wasn't good enough to get invited to in the first place then I certainly wouldn't go to a pity invite. Sounds like they aren't very good friends. Go out to something going on local where you might meet new friends.", "Nta and its 1000% a pity invite. They want to save face by inviting you last minute even though no one thought to invite you until everything was planned and you asked to hang. Drop the entire group and move on with your life. Life has to many twists and turns in it to stay friends with fake people\nAlso don\u2019t fall for the sunk cost fallacy if yall have been friends for a while.", "I think you should go find a new group of friends, who appreciate you.", "To be honest, how many clues do you need? If they've been hanging out without you, it means they don't like you anymore. I would be too paranoid hanging out with them and thinking about if they actually fuck with me or not the entire time. I think you should go make better friends.", "You already know the answer . You are NTA and you are not a priority to these people.", "Look even if it is a pity invite, go and have fun. If you get over the reason you were invited and just enjoy yourself and fully engage with everyone, you may get more invites. If you decide to go with an attitude, that vibe will be felt by everyone and you won\u2019t be invited again. NAH", ">I tend to me dramatic with my social anxiety flaring, but this definitely seems like a pity invite to me.\n\nIt might be a pity invite but the above makes you sound exhausting.  They might be happy if you came up with a flaky excuse....OR you could show up and really try to keep things under control. \n\nIf you cannot it's probably best you don't go.  IMO.", "I think you should go. Even if it is a pity invite, maybe you meet some folks at the event unconnected to them and hit it off.", "NTA but it\u2019s not necessary a pity invite, maybe this girl doesn\u2019t agree with you being left out.\n\nBut consider that sometimes people have different groups of friends which can cross over into other groups. Be honest about this, are you trying to push yourself into another friend group because you know a few of the girls? If this is truly not the case then there is a problem, either have the discussion and ask if you have upset anyone to please tell you, or call it a day and find new friends.\n\ntbh, if they have met 7 times without inviting you, then you are obviously not considered as much of their friend as you think you are.", "Go or don't go. Whatever your social anxiety allows for. However, going forward, I would put space between myself and all the other girls going sans the one who added you to the text. There is a reason she did and and its probable she does not appreciate what they are doing. Being much older, friend groups changes, even those from childhood. There is no reason to keep around people who lie to you. Absolutely none.", "Why does it matter if it's a pity invite? You wanted to hang out with them and now they invited you to hang out\n\nGo or don't go, but you can't force people to hang out with you. It sounds like you're getting what you wanted, so why is it not good enough?\n\nNAH because you're not really an A, but I can see why the group has started to distance themselves from you", "Don\u2019t pout. Go, have fun and maybe you\u2019ll be in invited again.", "That's a depressing trick your brain is playing on you. Your friend invited you to spend time with them and your first thought is they don't like you? Wow.", "If you're not comfortable, it's better not to go. Maybe you need more friends. But since I'm not sure, I'm going to say NAH.", "NTA.  It is probably a pity invite, but maybe not.  Do you really think the others were ignoring you because they didn't get back to you in an hour?  I realize I'm Gen X, but there are a lot of times I don't respond to a group chat for several hours and I wouldn't count that as ignoring anyone.", "NTA. Enjoy the party, maybe make some next friends to exchange.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Nothing in the post indicates this. Without more details, it would be a big assumption. Unless you personally know OP? Otherwise it sounds like a personal experience is clouding your opinion.", "That's not a party. That's a Christmas themed girls night.", "Don\u2019t go girl.", "Sorry to hear this, but can I say from my experience of sisters, daughters, nieces groups of friends, if someone is slowly getting excluded then there is a reason. \n\nsome examples I have heard of are, repeatedly pushing the others into their choices of where to go, what to do and not listening to anyone else\u2019s preferences, talking trash behind others backs, not paying their share in restaurants or for drinks, insisting on talking about subjects the others aren\u2019t interested in, being extrovert and embarrassing on nights out, getting too drunk and out of control, generally always wanting to be the centre of attention and not letting other have a chance to contribute.  I am not saying you are guilty of any of these but perhaps some self reflection is in order.\n\nPerhaps you should meet up with the girl that is closest to you and ask outright what the problem is and to be brutally honest because you are generally worried and upset.  If you choose to go down this route you need to accept the explanation given and not try to argue or justify yourself. If the friends group is important to you, then it\u2019s worth a try, otherwise, it\u2019s maybe time to move on. Often kids friends groups do not survive into adulthood.", "OP wrote\n\n>I tend to me dramatic with my social anxiety flaring\n\nI thought I restated it in a kinder way but OP admits she is dramatic and not everyone finds that palatable in a long term friend.  It sounds exhausting.", "None of OP\u2019s behavior in the post is dramatic. People being gaslit are often made to feel like they\u2019re being dramatic. If her \u201cfriends\u201d have an issue with her behavior, they should discuss it with her. They aren\u2019t being friends.", "She *herself* said she is dramatic.  You don't know if they discussed it with her and frankly they aren't under any obligation to.  Particularly if her response would be dramatic and exhausting.  \n\nWhen people make admissions against their self interest...I believe them.\n\nYou're right though, they have had enough of OP and probably don't want to be her friend.  So she should go look for some people who want a dramatic friend."]}
