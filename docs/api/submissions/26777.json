Our youngest was born this summer. We have always named our kids after people by not using their direct name. Our oldest girl is Jamie after my brother James, our middle daughter is Cleo after my sister Chloe and our youngest son is Devon after my husband's best friend Devine. We spoke to each person we honored prior to finalizing the name. My siblings were so happy and my husband's best friend was over the moon. We also never publicly said oh we named them after these people. We would just announce the names and leave it there.\n\nAfter my third child was born my half sister (12) asked me if I would name our next child after her. I told her I would not. She asked if I would name any child I have after her and my answer was the same, no.\n\nShe was upset about this. This angered my mom who said it was clear my kids were named after people and I shouldn't just honor two siblings and not honor all three. I replied that it should be mine and my husband's choice what we name our children and who we name them after. Mom said I looked my baby sister in the face and crushed her heart and soul and told her that she is not a real sibling and only full siblings are worthy of being honored. She said I had treated a child like shit and I should have offered to let her help pick a name or something to smooth things over. But instead I said no and acted like her feelings didn't matter.\n\nMy mom also had some things to say to my husband and he ignored her. He told me about it and I told her to keep my husband out of it.\n\nShe said I can take the role of sole asshole. Though she said my siblings were close since they didn't care about our half sister feeling upset either, according to mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694619875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hqgbj/aita_for_telling_my_half_sister_i_wont_name_a/", "score": 4718, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I grew up with my half sibling, we were as close as full blooded siblings, so if we had referred to each other has half brothers that would have been looked at as rude/hurtful/etc. \n\nYou dont state your age, but it sounds like there is a pretty good difference given you are on kid 3 and they are 12. You likely dont have the same closeness, which is something that happens even with full blooded siblings when there is a big age difference.(this is important imo)\n\nEven though you dont clearly state that you have named your children after others, its obviously insinuated, everyone knows. For you to feign ignorance about that is kind of ridiculous. You named them after the people. The people know, everyone else knows. \n\nThat said...Generally you name a child after someone to honor them. Maybe I'm looking at the situation incorrectly, but why are you honoring a 12 year old? What have they done to be honored? Do you have a relationship with them? Have they done things to help during your pregnancy? You honor someone for a reason.\n\nYour half sister is 12 years old FFS. They are a child. It doesnt matter if they are related to you or not, if a younger 'in law' was asking about this same thing, it would be expected for you to be as nice as possible about it. let alone your half sister. Your reaction seems spiteful. Why not just say something to not upset the kid(that is also your sister..?)\n\nYour mother says that you crushed her, treated a child like shit, etc, which makes me curious to the interaction. What did you say? Is mom being dramatic? Is this something that mom has done in the past, trying to force a relationship with her younger child with her older ones(likely creating negative feelings for both parties?)

Whenever a child entrusts you with serious, emotionally weighty stuff you have a responsibility to be kind and thoughtful. Cruelty makes you TA. Wouldn't the adult thing to do is to have a conversation with the child about names, and how they're chosen, and how she thinks about the whole process, and how you think about it, how your choices came along etc.?

Our youngest was born this summer. We have always named our kids after people by not using their direct name. Our oldest girl is Jamie after my brother James, our middle daughter is Cleo after my sister Chloe and our youngest son is Devon after my husband's best friend Devine. We spoke to each person we honored prior to finalizing the name. My siblings were so happy and my husband's best friend was over the moon. We also never publicly said oh we named them after these people. We would just announce the names and leave it there.\n\nAfter my third child was born my half sister (12) asked me if I would name our next child after her. I told her I would not. She asked if I would name any child I have after her and my answer was the same, no.\n\nShe was upset about this. This angered my mom who said it was clear my kids were named after people and I shouldn't just honor two siblings and not honor all three. I replied that it should be mine and my husband's choice what we name our children and who we name them after. Mom said I looked my baby sister in the face and crushed her heart and soul and told her that she is not a real sibling and only full siblings are worthy of being honored. She said I had treated a child like shit and I should have offered to let her help pick a name or something to smooth things over. But instead I said no and acted like her feelings didn't matter.\n\nMy mom also had some things to say to my husband and he ignored her. He told me about it and I told her to keep my husband out of it.\n\nShe said I can take the role of sole asshole. Though she said my siblings were close since they didn't care about our half sister feeling upset either, according to mom.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You said no. No is a complete sentence and so long as you didn't snicker/sneer/say it with malice/or taunt her about it, you did nothing wrong.

If nothing else, you could have deflected the question. The way you convey the conversation with your half sister seems like you were very abrupt.

There has to be a tremendous amount of effort from the elder sibling to build a relationship with the younger. My younger brother and I have a 22 year age gap and we're super close; I love him so much!   He's technically my half brother, but I never refer to him like that and he's never called me his half sister. It was easy to build a bond because I moved back to my hometown after college and I also chose to help my mother and stepdad with looking after him - effectively, he sees me as one of the people who helped raise him. I mean, I have literally taken him to doctor's appointments since it was easier for me to take leave from my job than my mom and step dad from theirs. I've done Back to School night when mom was on a business trip and step dad was on night shift. I'm all in when it comes to my little brother.

Which is kind of sad considering that the half sibling is just a kid. Whatever the reasoning taking it out in a child is cruel. You could have handled it better. Be honest but kinder. This kid probably already has a hard enough time feeling like part of the family and you solidifying that feeling will absolutely back fire.", "The way you wrote this YTA.\n\nObviously, name your kids whatever,  but you made yourself sound like you said that to the kid out of sheer spite. I mean, who treats a kid like that. I have 2 boys, 2 and 12 , and I've never met someone before that I couldn't tell whether I wanted to hug them or choke them. I still don't do or say things simply just to spite them no matter how angry they can make me.", "Yta for not handling it better, you crushed a child.

Since you were super cold towards her in a situation that didn't warrant it", "NTA- for telling her no \nBut you are a MAJOR AH for telling your 12 year old half sister that she isn't a *real* sibling and only full siblings have that honor. She is just as much your sibling as the others. She is young, and seeing as how you are on your 4th child there's a big age gap between the two, so maybe the fact that you weren't raised together there's a lack of bond with her compared to your other siblings but I guarantee she looked up to you and the others and you basically told her shes the black sheep of the family and you don't love her as much as the others, since she isnt a *real* sibling.

Could have handled it much better, especially to a kid.", "Technically, you are NTA for not naming your next child after your sister. You get to choose what you name your kids.\n\nHowever, you were an asshole in how you handled the situation. You probably should have had a little more foresight in how your kid sister would have seen this situation. You name 2 of your kids after your other siblings, your sister, who is a child, would probably see this as heartbreaking that your next child isn't being named after them. So there was probably a better way to explain to her why your next child will not be named after her and why your other children are named after your other siblings. \n\nSide note: It might not just be naming your potential next child after your half sister that's upsetting her. She probably takes this to mean that she doesn't mean as much to you as your other siblings.  The constant referring to your youngest sibling as half-sister makes me feel like you don't view them as a legitimate sibling or you have some resentment towards her. People I know with half siblings always referred to them as their as their brother or sister, never felt the need to specify that they were half. Your half-sister could view you as just her sister and not her half sister. It's possible that this is more about her relationship with you than it is the name.", "YTA for the way you handled this.

You did the right thing about telling her the truth but you could have done it gentler. She is only 12 and was really hurt. You could have even reassured her that it is not because she is your half-sister but because you liked the name you and your husband picked. When she asked if you have another baby would you name the baby after her, you could have said that you and your husband unfortunately don\u2019t want to have another baby. Explain that even if though your baby doesn\u2019t have your sister\u2019s name, that she will always be your children\u2019s aunt and you know she will be the best aunt.

You should have said something like \u201cwell there\u2019s no guarantee we\u2019ll have any more children in the future\u201d and left it at that. The naming of your children is yours and your husband\u2019s decision, and your mother shouldn\u2019t be forcing you to do anything.

But, our relationship now is completely different.\n\nTheir relationship is very different with each other because they grew up together. It's just what it is.\n\nIt's also a fact that half siblings relationships are impacted by the relationship with the parents. My sisters lived with our parents. Dad raised them. Mom raised them. Dad walked them down the aisle.\n\nDepending on why they have a half sibling, that affects it. Was there an affair, did one parent walk out? Did mom keep dropping off a toddler to babysit? Did they live with Dad?\n\nHow did that relationship play out? Because it's really hard to bond and share experiences with a little, little sibling. I say that as the younger sibling. Our relationship has completely shifted. I'm in my 30's.\n\nGuess what? One of my niblings is named after a sibling. I'm not offended one of the two oldest named their kid after the other sister. (Think Michelle to Michael, Joan to John for a middle name.)\n\nTheir relationship to each other isn't theirs to me. It's not like we don't see each other. I see them weekly. I just never went to elementary, middle and high school with them. I was a mid to late 90s and aughts kid. They were 80s and early 90s. Their pop culture wasn't mine.

It would make sense to swing it back towards him this time.\n\nAnd that could have been a reasonable way to put it to the 12 year old sister, too.  \"I'm sorry, but we're going to go with someone on my husband's side this time. It's only fair.\" etc.\n\nETA: I have to add here that I initially misread the post, and went back to reread it.  OP has 3 kids and that's it.  This isn't about OP expecting ANOTHER kid, who sister wants to be named for.  OP and husband named first 2 after OP's sisters, and 3rd kid after husband's best friend.  \n\nIt sounds like half-sister asked OP about this in more of a \"if you ever have another baby, would you name the baby after me?\" way.\n\nSo I kind of stand by my overall reaction to this.  Instead of saying \"I would never name a child after you\" (needlessly cruel), it would have been much easier to just say, \"I don't know if we'll have another baby\" or \"If we do have another baby, we would probably have to name it for someone from husband's side, so that it's even, and fair\", or something.", "I'm 31 now and i have never called my brother my half-brother even tho he is.

That she recognizes that is probably not what kid wanted to hear, that it's probably disappointed or makes her feel excluded. Then apologize for that.

Then if possible reassure kid that you do love her, and give some sort of explanation as to why she's not getting a baby named after her.

Beacuse they're fellow adults I'm able to lean on them for emotional support and help in hard finical times. While I want to provide that to you, I don't yet feel like you are old enough that would be fair for me as an adult to expect you to help take care of me. Right now, as an older member of the family, I see you as one of the kids that I should help take care of not the other way around. This dosen't mean I love you less then my other siblings, you're currently in the same category as my own kids (and any nieces/nephews?) and I defiantly don't love my own kids less. \n\nI know that may be hard to hear, beacuse you're almost a teenager and becoming more mature. And someday you will be an adult and our relationship will keep growing and changing as you age. Right now I am naming my children after adults in my life who are people I can count on to help me out and who I think are good role models for children. \n\nBut that dosen't mean my relationship to you isn't important.

By giving none, that kid is going to pick up on the one thing that is clearly different between her and her siblings. Her half sibling status.", "Your story contradicted you. If your friends father had said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d instead of yes, when she turned 16 he could\u2019ve said no without breaking a promise.", "I can't be Captain America? \ud83e\udd7a", "This is the best one.  Some of the others are trying to be tactful, but they flop because they\u2019re too detailed and subtly say some negative things.  Less is more.", "Makes you wonder what the backstory is there. Did mom break up the family ? Did mom remarry after dad cheated or something had to happen since op mentioned her other siblings have 0 fks about half siblings feelings aswell. if anything it could have been explained with siblings with huge age gaps  just don\u2019t have the same relationship as those who grew up together but either way op is a straight up AH", "That\u2019s the attitude this sub preaches \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "MVP right here", "Yup, all of this. OP is not morally an asshole but she is a tactless asshole none the less.", "My dad was always honest too and I appreciated that as I could improve that way and also knew he was serious when he said I was good. However, when he thought something wasn't good he would always explain why and say it in such a way that I knew he believed I could improve. That is what I appreciated the most. Whether or not I made a career out of singing was never really the issue there, he loved seeing me perform and enjoyed seeing me improve and so did I.\n\nThe sister in this case should not have lied, but she could have tried to at least explain it somehow. I mean, she does have a reason right? Can't she just try to explain it in a kid friendly manner? Or just say \"I'm really sorry, it's not that I don't appreciate you, the reason is just complicated and I don't really know how to explain it well.\" Something to that extend at least, at least the kid would know it wasn't her that did something wrong.", "Imagine if your dad said \"I love that kid on TV more than you.\" Would you feel the same way?\n\nThat's what OP essentially said. No nuance. No explanation. \"You're not a full relative and I don't consider you the same as my other brother and sister.\" That's incredibly cruel to a 12-year-old.\n\nOP could have easily given an explanation or tried to cushion the blow. Instead, she's just like \"actually no, I don't really care about you very much.\"", "Here's an alternative story, my parents yelled at me every time I sang or played an instrument, even though they insisted upon it from the age of nine onwards. I eventually stopped singing and playing the flute but still miss it to this day, and I feel doubtful about my general worth and talent (this is likely a partial result of how I was treated as a child). This comment screams of a parent who never supported their children and told the story how they wanted their child to see it in order to get internet points.\n\nOP could have and should have been nicer to her baby sister. She is an adult and her sister is a child.", "You're supposed to be the adult.  She's 12.  You could have made an effort to visit her and get to know her.  Your comments drip with resentment toward her.  I'm sure there's something behind that resentment but whatever it is, it surely isn't her fault.  I'm not telling you you have to name a future child after her but treating her as you did makes YTA.  You made her feel like a stranger to you and less than a member of your family. That's a terrible thing to do to a child.  Learn some empathy.", "You don't have to be close to her, but you could have been kinder. You owe that poor kid an apology for that alone. You're an adult and are responsible for how you treat children, even if you don't know them well.", "That's really hard, I know family dynamics are different for every family but I'm 17 years older than my baby sister, yes she is my \"half sister\" but I would never call her that or be so cruel as how OP is being towards her own sibling. I honestly could never understand that dynamic, I love my baby sister and actively try to be present in her life.", "Golden child? She's a mom defending her 12 year old because a grown almost 30 year old woman was being an asshole to her for asking a damn question.", "This subreddit is sick tbh in that regard.", "OP could and should have seen this coming imo. She\u2019s named a kid after each sibling? Then it\u2019s pretty understandable her sister might ask that question.", "As someone with 3 older half siblings who pretended to not hate me growing up, I really wish they would have been straight about it from day one instead of finding out after 20 years how much they resented my very existence. At least that way I could have grown up knowing where I stood instead of learning my entire childhood was a massive lie at 20", "wow. I knew a kid with the exact same name back when I was in primary school in Australia. too many idiot parents lol", "I knew someone by that name (Benjamin Dover) in about 8th or 9th grade. I felt so bad for him back then.", "What about the proper spelling C\u00e8ilidh?", "Ceighleigh is still better than cheelee although I agree they are both tradjeteighs.", "My best mate has 3 older siblings, 1 same parents, the other 2 I don't know if they are step or half, cause he refers to them as his brother and sister.", "my grandma taught a girl named Female, same situation, but they put the emphasis on the second syllable (so it almost sounded like \u201ctamale\u201d). US south as well. her parents weren\u2019t very fluent english speakers at the time, and by the time they were, changing your child\u2019s name when they\u2019re already 6 is a lot of hassle", "Isn\u2019t it Larry, Darryl, and the other brother Darryl?", "The version I heard was twins Ma-lee and Fe-ma-lee.\n\nAnother was Nosmo King", "My nickname as a baby was Chili, I found this out as a teenager and was so excited because it was so cute and I love nicknames.
