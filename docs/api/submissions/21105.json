You weren't embarrassing, he chose to be embarrassed.  Don't let him muffle your joy.  Ask yourself if this is a one off, or is he frequently \"embarrassed\" by you? Your dancing hardly seems like justification for the frigid shoulder.  If he doesn't find your occasional goofiness endearing, you might want to rethink your relationship.", "NTA, everyone was drunk and you decided to dance. No big deal. \n\nIf the bf were the one posting, I'd tell him that if he didn't want his gf to act like a teenager, he shouldn't date one. \n\nThat's not a slam against 19 year olds. Just that there is a difference between 19 and 25 year olds. It's possible the two of you aren't compatible.", "NTA and him treating your joy as an embarrassment and making you feel this way and question yourself is a huge red flag. as is the fact that he's chosen to date a teenager as a 25 year old. it screams someone who is seeking to control their less experienced partner because they haven't been through life to know better than to accept his weird behaviour and berating of you for being happy and alive. btw, i have been the younger partner and this equation and want to clearly state to you that this isn't a dig on your desirability or maturity at all, i'm sure you are plenty of each of those, but it doesn't change that someone at that life stage seeking someone at your life stage out, especially when they reflexively belittle the younger partner and shame them for acting a certain way screams predatory. it is a reflection of HIM not of you. don't let him dim your shine. my advice would be to cut loose of this to the next thing while you're still 19 cos i've experienced and witnessed first hand what it is to lose years of your life appeasing people who treat u like this.", "NTA\n\nBoyfriend sounds boring.", "NTA I reserve the right to break out in song or dance whenever I damn well feel like it. You should too!

You don't have to feel ashame because you're dancing, especially if everyone is drunk. \n\nIf he is ashamed of you, you need to start to think about your relation with him. If you can't just be natural and have fun at a party, there is a problem. With family maybe, but it was friends !\n\n\"I'd acted out for attention.**\"** And that's even worse, that mean you have to be quiet all the time ?", "NTA. You were just dancing to a song at a party. It's not that deep. Sounds like he was the only one who had a problem with it. Another girl even joined you. It's a red flag, though, that your boyfriend is cold towards you simply because you do something he doesn't like. That isn't healthy. In safe, healthy relationships partners communicate and listen to each other. They don't attempt to control each other's behavior by criticism and withholding affection.", "NTA\n\nI can see how he would find it embarrassing. Especially since it's the 1st time meeting and no one was dancing. \nI dont think you're an AH, though. You were drinking and having a good time.", "NTA - he sounds insecure and very boring. Im not even much of a dancing person myself and Im saying thats a very boring attitude to have out of all this. \n\nHave fun and if someone else\u2019s form of having fun doesn\u2019t match your own, still support it and have a good time!", "How DARE you dance in front of his FRIENDS?! Just kidding though, your boyfriend's a punk. Who cares if you don't think you have the moves? Dance if you're happy.

What seems cute at 19 is embarrassing at 25. I'm sure the alcohol effect didn't help either.", "ESH: you were probably drunk and looked embarrassed, your boyfriend was probably overreacting because drunk people are inherently embarrassing but what you did wasn't *that* embarrassing.", "NAH. My friend group from college had one girl who was a few years younger than the rest of us (19 vs 22). She also never drank/partied in HS. \nShe was notoriously bad for not reading the room and she would dance in like a sexy (questionable lol) way and really over-exaggerate how drunk she was even at really low-key events. \nIt was certainly embarrassing and made everyone a little uncomfortable but we all remember being exactly like that in HS so we never called her on it because we didn\u2019t want her to feel bad/awkward. \nThinking back, I wish I would\u2019ve let her know sooner because the way we all side-eyed each other and rolled our eyes at it wasn\u2019t nice either. \n\nYou think it\u2019s cute and fun now but the people around you likely don\u2019t feel that way. To be frank, your bf probably saved you from being the butt of a joke but he definitely could\u2019ve gone about it in a nicer way.", "YTA. It was his friends and their mood. You took a chill \u201cdrinking and talking\u201d to a dance party. I can image the looks of \u201cis she really doing this right now?\u201d going around. But, most people don\u2019t hold innocent, drunk shenanigans against people. You can both get past this. It\u2019s not a huge ordeal.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, you're not even old enough to drink but that's beside the point. You definitely embarrassed yourself and him. You should have been on your best behavior. Maybe the girl that danced with you just wanted to end the train wreck and save everyone. I highly doubt this relationship will last, that age and maturity gap is massive. In the future, you need to learn to read the room much less your dates pleas to you. No means no!", "INFO: how drunk were you?", "Not just boring, insecure and toxic really. NTA girl find someone who actually enjoys you.", "Same. I also reserve breaking out in song or dancing at any time I want. And I'm in no way good at it besides the fun part", "The drinking age is 18 in a lot of countries.", "Do you know where OP lives?\n\nETA: I am not even going to bother replying to the rest of your comment.", "There are 195 countries on earth. Almost all of them have a legal drinking age of 18/19 or younger, and for a lot of those it is actually legal for minors to drink at home, they just can't buy their own alcohol. I would guess that you're American and assuming that OP is too, that's probably not the case. 19 is plenty old enough to drink at home in a low key environment.", "NTA - be wary of boyfriends who are easily embarrassed by how you choose to have fun. That\u2019s a big red flag. Who wants to date someone who\u2019s always asking you to tone down your personality? If another girl joined you to dance and you weren\u2019t like feeling each other up or something over the top then I would say that\u2019s a pretty benign and normal thing to happen amongst a group of drunk people who are listening to music.", "If he finds your enjoyment embarrassing then how are you supposed to enjoy yourself with him? Never make yourself smaller for someone else, even a partner.", "NTA. As others have said, if he wants to date a 'mature' gal who won't dance (esp while drunk) maybe he should date someone his age. (Not giving you shit for being 19, giving him shit for dating a 19 y/o)", "Girl this is a marinara flag- guy can\u2019t even let you dance to your favorite song? That\u2019s a super normal thing to do. You are not embarrassing, he\u2019s embarrassed, and that\u2019s on him. Sounds like a joy-thief.", "Let me tell you, my ex treated me the same way. Notice I said ex. Never let anyone treat you like you're an embarrassment. You deserve someone who will love you no matter what. Nta and this guy is not a good fit for you, I hope you realize it sooner rather than later.", "NTA, my wife will randomly break into song or dance anywhere or anytime. I could never imagine making her feel shame for being happy and being herself. You need to find someone who is proud of the person you are.", "NTA  \n\nIt sounds like you were behaving like a normal person.  It doesn't sound like he was.  \n\nIf you're in the US then he sounds, not so great. If you're from a country with a drinking age below 21 then I have no business commenting.", "Nta. And please listen to everyone telling you that he's trouble. I'm 25 now and I have absolutely nothing in common with a 19 year old. When I was 19 I didn't see a huge difference between me and a 25 year old, but now on the other side of it, 19 year olds look like actual children to me. I feel maternal towards them. There is something wrong with a man my age who wants to date someone your age. Please be cautious", "Not enough INFO to form a proper judgement I feel. You say you were all drunk, so it's entirely possible that you did indeed embarrass him and go completely over the top. Without actually being there and witnessing it, then it's impossible to form an opinion.", "What kind of dancing? Just having fun or did you belong on a pole?? Need to know the INFO.", "He kept saying no.  How many times did you ask?", "NTA\n\nYou're dating a guy 33% older than you who won't let you act your own age. You need to recognize he may not want you to act your age.", "All the people making a big deal on here about the fact that he's 25 and you 19 and that he's looking for someone he can more easily manipulate are just full of it. He's just a dick.\n\nNTA, dump him and find someone better.", "YTA kinda.\n\nI get girls just wanna have fun....\n\nRead the room though.", "INFO \n\nPlayful dancing or sexual dancing?", "ESH: You did pester him to dance so that wasn\u2019t good but you should be able to dance.", "Nta dance", "I can\u2019t say how your relationship is supposed to look like\u2026 but if my wife was dancing alone I would move rivers and mountains to dance with her, even if she was making a fool of herself, there would be two idiots in love making a fool of themselves for eternity", "NTA. I dated a guy like that. He is now my ex because he tried to stop me doing things that he thought made him look bad. Your bf sees you as something to control. Break up with him. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed for having fun and being yourself", "NTA.  Your boyfriend is boring and insecure.", "Are guys today really that \u2026 pathetic?", "I'm curious: what is the legal drinking age where you live? In many parts of the states it is 21. If you're dating a guy who's 25 and your 19 and he's letting you get drunk at parties, something is definitely definitely off even if the drinking age is less than 21. \n\nIt's also a red flag that he's got a problem with you dancing at a party. If it was a party of maybe three people and you were the only one dancing, it could be awkward but you are still just expressing yourself and you got drunk and everyone else was drunk. Still. I don't like the sound of this relationship one bit and you shouldn't either.", "I completely agree, depending on how inebriated she was. If you are buzzed or sober and want to dance for joy? Do it, hell I'd probably dance with you as well. If you're sloppy drunk and causing a ruckus with your moves? I might be embarrassed at it as well.", "NTA - I dulled my sparkle for my boyfriend of 5 years. Everything I did and all the parts of my personality he didn't like came back. No one else in my life had issues with anything he didn't like. It isn't you; it's him.", "agreed 100%, OP, NTA at all. my boyfriend and i love a wee dance, if sober it\u2019ll usually just be when we\u2019re alone but while very drunk at a friends? at a bar? at a party/gathering? oh yeah baby we\u2019re doing some silly little dances\n\nedit: just ts i don\u2019t think all couples should be like this or anything, just that my bf and i compliment each other well in the sense we\u2019re both very jokey/goofy and would never put one another down or be cold toward the other for something like that being \u201cembarrassing\u201d.", "Yeah even your last paragraph sounds like you might be a little conditioned to overthink tiny little actions like this. You were having fun. Enjoy life girlie. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for \u2764\ufe0f", "Absolutely. When the dance floor and your song call, you have to answer. It's sad he hasn't experienced that.", "I agree. We have only one account"]}
