What seems cute at 19 is embarrassing at 25. I'm sure the alcohol effect didn't help either.", "ESH: you were probably drunk and looked embarrassed, your boyfriend was probably overreacting because drunk people are inherently embarrassing but what you did wasn't *that* embarrassing.", "NAH. My friend group from college had one girl who was a few years younger than the rest of us (19 vs 22). She also never drank/partied in HS. \nShe was notoriously bad for not reading the room and she would dance in like a sexy (questionable lol) way and really over-exaggerate how drunk she was even at really low-key events. \nIt was certainly embarrassing and made everyone a little uncomfortable but we all remember being exactly like that in HS so we never called her on it because we didn\u2019t want her to feel bad/awkward. \nThinking back, I wish I would\u2019ve let her know sooner because the way we all side-eyed each other and rolled our eyes at it wasn\u2019t nice either. \n\nYou think it\u2019s cute and fun now but the people around you likely don\u2019t feel that way. To be frank, your bf probably saved you from being the butt of a joke but he definitely could\u2019ve gone about it in a nicer way.", "YTA. It was his friends and their mood. You took a chill \u201cdrinking and talking\u201d to a dance party. I can image the looks of \u201cis she really doing this right now?\u201d going around. But, most people don\u2019t hold innocent, drunk shenanigans against people. You can both get past this. It\u2019s not a huge ordeal.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, you're not even old enough to drink but that's beside the point. You definitely embarrassed yourself and him. You should have been on your best behavior. Maybe the girl that danced with you just wanted to end the train wreck and save everyone. I highly doubt this relationship will last, that age and maturity gap is massive. In the future, you need to learn to read the room much less your dates pleas to you. No means no!", "INFO: how drunk were you?", "Not just boring, insecure and toxic really. NTA girl find someone who actually enjoys you.", "Same. I also reserve breaking out in song or dancing at any time I want.

Almost all of them have a legal drinking age of 18/19 or younger, and for a lot of those it is actually legal for minors to drink at home, they just can't buy their own alcohol. I would guess that you're American and assuming that OP is too, that's probably not the case. 19 is plenty old enough to drink at home in a low key environment.", "NTA - be wary of boyfriends who are easily embarrassed by how you choose to have fun. That\u2019s a big red flag. Who wants to date someone who\u2019s always asking you to tone down your personality? If another girl joined you to dance and you weren\u2019t like feeling each other up or something over the top then I would say that\u2019s a pretty benign and normal thing to happen amongst a group of drunk people who are listening to music.", "If he finds your enjoyment embarrassing then how are you supposed to enjoy yourself with him? Never make yourself smaller for someone else, even a partner.", "NTA. As others have said, if he wants to date a 'mature' gal who won't dance (esp while drunk) maybe he should date someone his age.

And please listen to everyone telling you that he's trouble. I'm 25 now and I have absolutely nothing in common with a 19 year old. When I was 19 I didn't see a huge difference between me and a 25 year old, but now on the other side of it, 19 year olds look like actual children to me. I feel maternal towards them. There is something wrong with a man my age who wants to date someone your age. Please be cautious", "Not enough INFO to form a proper judgement I feel.

I dated a guy like that. He is now my ex because he tried to stop me doing things that he thought made him look bad. Your bf sees you as something to control. Break up with him.

Your boyfriend is boring and insecure.", "Are guys today really that \u2026 pathetic?", "I'm curious: what is the legal drinking age where you live? In many parts of the states it is 21. If you're dating a guy who's 25 and your 19 and he's letting you get drunk at parties, something is definitely definitely off even if the drinking age is less than 21. \n\nIt's also a red flag that he's got a problem with you dancing at a party. If it was a party of maybe three people and you were the only one dancing, it could be awkward but you are still just expressing yourself and you got drunk and everyone else was drunk. Still. I don't like the sound of this relationship one bit and you shouldn't either.", "I completely agree, depending on how inebriated she was. If you are buzzed or sober and want to dance for joy?
