You weren't embarrassing, he chose to be embarrassed.  Don't let him muffle your joy.  Ask yourself if this is a one off, or is he frequently \"embarrassed\" by you? Your dancing hardly seems like justification for the frigid shoulder.  If he doesn't find your occasional goofiness endearing, you might want to rethink your relationship.", "NTA, everyone was drunk and you decided to dance. No big deal. \n\nIf the bf were the one posting, I'd tell him that if he didn't want his gf to act like a teenager, he shouldn't date one. \n\nThat's not a slam against 19 year olds. Just that there is a difference between 19 and 25 year olds. It's possible the two of you aren't compatible.", "NTA and him treating your joy as an embarrassment and making you feel this way and question yourself is a huge red flag. as is the fact that he's chosen to date a teenager as a 25 year old. it screams someone who is seeking to control their less experienced partner because they haven't been through life to know better than to accept his weird behaviour and berating of you for being happy and alive. btw, i have been the younger partner and this equation and want to clearly state to you that this isn't a dig on your desirability or maturity at all, i'm sure you are plenty of each of those, but it doesn't change that someone at that life stage seeking someone at your life stage out, especially when they reflexively belittle the younger partner and shame them for acting a certain way screams predatory. it is a reflection of HIM not of you. don't let him dim your shine. my advice would be to cut loose of this to the next thing while you're still 19 cos i've experienced and witnessed first hand what it is to lose years of your life appeasing people who treat u like this.", "NTA\n\nBoyfriend sounds boring.", "NTA I reserve the right to break out in song or dance whenever I damn well feel like it. You should too! AND IM 43", "If he wants a more mature girlfriend he can date someone his own age\u2026.\n\nJk you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for dancing at any age of you all were sober maybe I\u2019d agree it was for attention but you were just enjoying yourself NTA", "NTA You are in a party, with friends. You don't have to feel ashame because you're dancing, especially if everyone is drunk. \n\nIf he is ashamed of you, you need to start to think about your relation with him. If you can't just be natural and have fun at a party, there is a problem. With family maybe, but it was friends !\n\n\"I'd acted out for attention.**\"** And that's even worse, that mean you have to be quiet all the time ?", "NTA. You were just dancing to a song at a party. It's not that deep. Sounds like he was the only one who had a problem with it. Another girl even joined you. It's a red flag, though, that your boyfriend is cold towards you simply because you do something he doesn't like. That isn't healthy. In safe, healthy relationships partners communicate and listen to each other. They don't attempt to control each other's behavior by criticism and withholding affection.", "NTA\n\nI can see how he would find it embarrassing. Especially since it's the 1st time meeting and no one was dancing. \nI dont think you're an AH, though. You were drinking and having a good time.", "NTA - he sounds insecure and very boring. Im not even much of a dancing person myself and Im saying thats a very boring attitude to have out of all this. \n\nHave fun and if someone else\u2019s form of having fun doesn\u2019t match your own, still support it and have a good time!", "How DARE you dance in front of his FRIENDS?! Just kidding though, your boyfriend's a punk. Who cares if you don't think you have the moves? Dance if you're happy. Y'all aren't compatible because he's an insecure person and you're too awesome for him.\n\nEdit to add NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What seems cute at 19 is embarrassing at 25. I'm sure the alcohol effect didn't help either.", "ESH: you were probably drunk and looked embarrassed, your boyfriend was probably overreacting because drunk people are inherently embarrassing but what you did wasn't *that* embarrassing.", "NAH. My friend group from college had one girl who was a few years younger than the rest of us (19 vs 22). She also never drank/partied in HS. \nShe was notoriously bad for not reading the room and she would dance in like a sexy (questionable lol) way and really over-exaggerate how drunk she was even at really low-key events. \nIt was certainly embarrassing and made everyone a little uncomfortable but we all remember being exactly like that in HS so we never called her on it because we didn\u2019t want her to feel bad/awkward. \nThinking back, I wish I would\u2019ve let her know sooner because the way we all side-eyed each other and rolled our eyes at it wasn\u2019t nice either. \n\nYou think it\u2019s cute and fun now but the people around you likely don\u2019t feel that way. To be frank, your bf probably saved you from being the butt of a joke but he definitely could\u2019ve gone about it in a nicer way.", "YTA. It was his friends and their mood. You took a chill \u201cdrinking and talking\u201d to a dance party. I can image the looks of \u201cis she really doing this right now?\u201d going around. But, most people don\u2019t hold innocent, drunk shenanigans against people. You can both get past this. It\u2019s not a huge ordeal.", "ESH\n\nFirst of all, you're not even old enough to drink but that's beside the point. You definitely embarrassed yourself and him. You should have been on your best behavior. Maybe the girl that danced with you just wanted to end the train wreck and save everyone. I highly doubt this relationship will last, that age and maturity gap is massive. In the future, you need to learn to read the room much less your dates pleas to you. No means no!", "INFO: how drunk were you?", "Not just boring, insecure and toxic really. NTA girl find someone who actually enjoys you.", "Same. I also reserve breaking out in song or dancing at any time I want. And I'm in no way good at it besides the fun part", "The drinking age is 18 in a lot of countries.", "Do you know where OP lives?\n\nETA: I am not even going to bother replying to the rest of your comment.", "There are 195 countries on earth. Almost all of them have a legal drinking age of 18/19 or younger, and for a lot of those it is actually legal for minors to drink at home, they just can't buy their own alcohol. I would guess that you're American and assuming that OP is too, that's probably not the case. 19 is plenty old enough to drink at home in a low key environment."]}
