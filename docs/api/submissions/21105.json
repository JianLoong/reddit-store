My wife and I are in our fifties and I would not for a second think it childish if anyone at any party want ed to dance to a great song.", "He sounds controlling. Maybe next he'll tell her what to wear.", "My friends & I are in our late 30s, early 40s & still act like OP \ud83e\udd23", "you think like OPs boyfriend, I'm past 30yrs and I still dance my ass off whenever I want to.", "Exactly. She\u2019s not legally old enough to drink but he gets mad that she drank too much and had fun?  Don\u2019t supply her with booze if you don\u2019t want her to drink and stop dating teenagers. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Psh. Who said she\u2019s acting like a teenager? I randomly dance with my dogs while cleaning. It\u2019s fun! And I\u2019m far from 19.", "Yo, c'mon.. I'm 35 and have danced on the street yesterday while passing a bar that had a sweet beat playing. Don't age restrict enjoying the music :D", "Do people just break their kneecaps at 25? Is that why everyone in their thirties complains of bad knees?\nWhen did dancing become a \"teenage\" activity? While drinking at a bar no less!\n\nWhat's next actually having fun?/s", "THIS. Fuck this bf.", "Boring is harsh. I love dancing but if I was in the middle of a chill conversation with friends and a partner randomly kept pestering me to dance, I would be annoyed. \n\nHe sucks for how he handled it but not for not wanting to just start dancing in the middle of his friends when that's not his vibe.", "\u201cWhy is my girlfriend who is 6 years younger than me not acting my age\u201d", "I never get drunk but I will still dance to a fun song out of nowhere. It's not for attention, it's for ME to have fun in my life, because my life is too short to dull my spark for everyone around me. Now if we were out in public and being disruptive, I'd say it's inconsiderate at best and attention seeking beyond best case scenario.", ">When I was 19 I didn\u2019t see a huge difference between me and a 25 year old, but now on the other side of it, 19 year olds look like actual children\n\nPreach! I couldn\u2019t have said it better", "Yep, I was thinking the same. Why is he a 25 year adult man dating with a 19 year old woman? NTA", "100% this. I was 19 when an internet friend had a crush on me and I didn\u2019t see it as weird (though I broke off the friendship because something he said DID feel controlling once I found out abt his crush). By the time I was in my mid 20s, I wouldn\u2019t even THINK of an \u201cadult\u201d teenager in that way. Such a red flag when grown people date that young.", "I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s should be embarrassing. Everyone was drunk and having a good time? Im surprised not more people started dancing. You would be embarrassed when your parents started dancing in front of your friend when you where younger.", "How would it be embarrassing? Unless she was absolutely plastered which I'm sure the bf would have brought up", "She is 19, an adult?", "Oh come on, ffs.", "The first red flag was a 25 yr old man dating someone just out of high school.", "3.7 times", "It's hard to tell here; there's lots of parties where dancing isn't normal behavior. If I was at a place where everyone is sitting around talking, and a drunk teenager started dancing, I would not call that normal.", "Considering how she spelled \u2018favorite\u2019 as \u2018favourite\u2019 it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019s in the states..", "Not everyone is American", "Canada has a legal drinking at of 19, except for Quebec where it's 18.", "Nah - you ain't gatekeeping fun for girls. Ever. Cause they won't let you. You can't control them anymore. Love it.", "As said husband, I completely agree. NTA. He should want to be up there with you, and not caring what his mates think. I never used to get up and dance, and I always wished I could. I can\u2019t dance at all. But I\u2019ve realised that the only way to be up there dancing is to get up and just dance! Life is too short to live in fear of how someone else may judge you", "this. don\u2019t change yourself for your partner, there\u2019s someone out there who will like you for whoever it is you want to be", "I was going to say\u2026OP WAS acting \u201cnormal\u201d for a19 yr old. BF wants to be seen as\u2026I was going to say cool but cold and unfeeling come to mind. I wonder if he was told not to smile because that also makes you look tough?", "I had a friend who around the same age as OP met and briefly dated a 35 year old business casual type. She dumped him when she realized he didn\u2019t value her personality and intellect but just wanted a 19 year old goth gf trophy wife", "Literally the first thing that came to my mind.", "I just noticed that, I hope this is in Canada or somewhere else you can legally drink at 19.  \n\n\nBut yeah, she's 19, she'd been drinking, it's not surprising that she might dance to a song she liked.  If he doesn't want his girlfriend acting like a teenager, then maybe he shouldn't be dating teenagers.", "God I wish spontaneous, joyful dancing were a thing. The only time I see people dancing nowadays is when they\u2019re making a TikTok. I went to a wedding and during the reception I was shocked that the DJ was playing great songs and no one was dancing, not any age. How sad.", "I\u2019m exactly like you in that respect. In the middle of a GA floor at a concert where I can\u2019t be singled out\u2026maybe. On a dance floor like at a wedding\u2026.still probably going to be a no. In a room at a party with no one else dancing\u2026 not on your f\u2019n life. \n\nBut I\u2019m certainly not going to stop anyone else.", "Nobody wants to hear it. Maybe once in a blue moon it could work, but it\u2019s more often than not, gonna end up poorly. She was probably 18 at the time they got together or very close, it just don\u2019t sit right with me", "Exactly the issue is the difference in ages and maturity.", "My parents used to throw this massive party when I was young, my sister and I would dance the night away, and as soon as Jumping Jack Flash or Proud Mary would start up my parents and their friends (al 40/50s then) would join us, good times", "Another 50+ married person here. This, so much. It's not embarrassing if people express their happiness! It's just embarrassing if they desperately try to hide it.", "I think it's not so much the dancing itself, as it is the \"I'm drunk and randomly start dancing in a room with a smallish number of people who are all (presumably) just sitting around talking, insisting other people should join me\". There's nothing wrong with that, but I would associate that more with teenagers than adults.", "I am curious as well, people in all age groups, cultures dance in all periods of history, prehistory from time to time. It is one behaviour that makes us uniquely  human.", "I\u2019m 22 and still twerk to Adele. Op is def nta", "I mean, she is everywhere but the states, we don\u2019t know where they are.", "Because drunk 25 year olds would never dance to music. \n\nHim not wanting to dance doesn\u2019t make him more mature or something, he\u2019s just an asshole.", "There is no dancing to your favorite songs way too often! Just go for it!", "The boyfriend is the less mature one. OP please dump him.", "To be fair, having music you dance on playing, everyone being a bit drunk and someone else joining gives the impression that it wasn't too much of a sophisticated hang-out", "Maybe she\u2019s in Germany. It\u2019s 16 there \ud83d\ude02", "Found the person in an AGR lol", "Maybe because they have not yet been shamed enough to stop?", "OP is a teenager though\u2026", "I'm sorry that your life has become so dull that this is your experience.", "that was chilling to read that little segment. so glad ur on this side of it now", "Not everyone likes to dance", "That doesn\u2019t mean you control who does.", "So that means it's more of a personal preference thing than a maturity thing."]}
