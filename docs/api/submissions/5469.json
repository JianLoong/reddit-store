They are 100% alcoholics.  You need to protect your kids.  Not only is witnessing drunken adult antics potentially traumatizing, you were a child and they pushed excessive drinking on you.

Having the option to choose your environment and live life on your terms is one of the best things about being an adult. There was a lot of drinking, smoking, and bad behavior on the part of the people I grew up with, and I often fantasized about being able to get in a car and drive away from all of it.

I grew up with an alcoholic mother and I *hate* certain holidays because of so many bad experiences. You're prioritizing your children rather than alcohol. Second, if you have the time, I recommend the book \"The Adult Children of Alcoholics Syndrome.\" It was recommended to me by a therapist many years ago and it was immensely helpful for me. When your kids get older, like junior high/high school age, and they're at a point where their friends might consider drinking, please have a really calm, honest discussion with them about alcohol. There's some evidence that alcoholism has a genetic component, so even though you've chosen sobriety, they may be at risk for developing similar struggles. When it's appropriate, find a way to talk to them about the risks and dangers, and explain why you've made the choice to abstain from drinking.
