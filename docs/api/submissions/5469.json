Congratulations on your sobriety. Being sober when everyone else is drunk is no fun at all and I think it is truly wonderful that you want your kids to grow up differently and not see excessive alcohol consumption as the norm.", "Nta. \n\n>My aunts took this as me calling them all alcoholics\n\nYou didn't say that, but if the shoe fits... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA - you are a mom who is prioritizing her kids and her own health. You are doing EXACTLY what those kids need & deserve.", "NTA\n\nYeah, spare your kids the experience of that alkie Cringemas.", "NTA\n\nYour kids, your rules. If your aunties cannot put down the drink to spend a few hours with your kids- they obviously do not care that much about your kids.", "NTA.  The generational dysfunction of drunk holidays stops with YOU.\nCongratulations for stopping the generational alcohol abuse.", "NTA", "NTA - they're your kids, your choice. I like a drink, but no one should be pressed into it. You aren't asking them to not drink either, just doing your own thing for Xmas. Holding boundaries is healthy, good for you.", "NTA. You make the best decision for your kids and for yourself too. I hope your family will have an awakening regarding their alcohol abuse. Stay away from them and congratulations for breaking the circle. Have a fun Christmas time with your kids", "NTA. As a parent, your first obligation is to your kids.   Good on you for getting sober and providing a better childhood for your kids than the one you had.", "I mean if the stocking fits...you have every right to make sure your kids don't have a dumpster fire Christmas. Families don't like getting called out by Captain Obvious. Do your kids proud & make memories with them that they'll want to remember! \nNTA", "NTA\n\nI get it. I stopped hanging around with a lot of my friends because all they want to do is drink. I moved out of that lifestyle years ago and have no desire to drink until I'm torn out of the frame. I don't see it as you are keeping the kids from them as much as keeping the kids away from their behavior and what could result from it.", "NTA\n\nIf they were willing to push drinking on a freaking eleven year old kid and feel that defensive about thier alcohol use and -demand- you expose your kids to it because your refusal makes them feel bad, then yeah.  They are 100% alcoholics.  You need to protect your kids.  Not only is witnessing drunken adult antics potentially traumatizing, you were a child and they pushed excessive drinking on you.  Do you honestly think they would refrain from doing the same to your kids?   Slipping them sips when they think you won't notice and laughing about it behind your back?", "NTA.\n\nAlcohol is one of only a handful of literal poison society accepts as a 'cultural pass time'.\n\nI don't drink, and I'm certainly not a religious fruitcake, but alcohol literally is at the root of so much societal evil that even being around drunken buffoonery is too much for me.\n\nIt's not too much to ask that kids not be exposed to drunken antics, not is it too much to ask that your relative spend one X-Mas party not wasted.", "NTA you are the matriach of your family now - you design the day around your children's needs and if its just you guys and no extended family - then thats ok too - have lots of fun, plan lots of activities and games, watch movies. Visit your parents the day after or day before in future so they see their grandparents and get their presents and tell the family as a mother now you will spend Xmas at home.\n\nAnd I agree its not fun being around inebriated people if you are not drinking - its just an awful experience. So I've always taken myself out of those situations.", "NTA\n\nYes they are alcoholics. Its good that you don't want your kids there. It seems to be the whole family covering up alcoholism with tradition.", "NTA.\n\nYou could have just said that you want to make memories of holidays at *home* for your kids, rather than elsewhere, but, the heavy drinking around young children is not a good example to set. Neither is the smoking.\n\nYou can visit individual families for an hour or two during the holiday season, but pass on the drunken revelry.", "I think a compromise could be (if it\u2019s close by) to head there early and let the kids hang with the family for a little bit and head out before the shenanigans start. I wouldn\u2019t want my children around adults smoking though, especially if they\u2019re doing it out in the open (I\u2019m assuming you mean weed). There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to go at all, but if the kids want to see them and vice versa the compromise could work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Calling drunk people drunk is harsh but maybe effectively sobering (ha!)", ">My aunts took this as me calling them all alcoholics\n\nWell if the shoe fits! \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Nta. You are doing the best you can for your kids.", "NTA. It's hard with family who drinks (and always goes too far). I have learned I only have so much patience for it and I can always just leave once it's too much. \n\nI'm a single person with no kids. So it is easier for me to peace out when the drinking is getting out of hand. Everyone's holiday is different in how they celebrate so hopefully the animosity doesn't build up and your able to enjoy sober Christmas with your kids and maybe find a way to at least see or spend time with the family. If not, your doing your kids a favor keeping them away from irresponsible behavior.", "NTA\n\nPlease keep your kids away from your family. Congratulations on your sobriety, the family seems very toxic", "NTA, and as for your aunt's comment--gee, ya think??  If you can't stay sober long enough to finish cooking dinner, lady, you've got a problem.\n\nAlso, there's a huge difference between \"Let the kids have a sip of what the adults are having\" and \"Get her started drinking at 11 and don't even blink when she gets sloshed.\"\n\nAlso also, something I learned in counseling just came back to my mind: One sign of an addiction is when somebody says \"I don't like how you act when you're not sober\" and you start finding reasons to call them a bad person.", "NTA. Having the option to choose your environment and live life on your terms is one of the best things about being an adult. There was a lot of drinking, smoking, and bad behavior on the part of the people I grew up with, and I often fantasized about being able to get in a car and drive away from all of it. One day that happened. It was glorious. Too bad if they think you're calling them alcoholics. They most likely are to some degree. More than anything, though, on behalf of your kids, I'm really proud of you.", "NTA \n\nYou're handling being an adult better than your family TBH. I think that keeping yourself and your kids away from that is a smart, healthy decision.", "NTA.\n\nYou mention your family got you started drinking at 11. And you went along with it because that was what was normalised with them.\n\nIf you continue going to these events, how long until your family are trying to sneak drinks to your kids. \"Just let them try a sip of beer? A little bit of wine\". Doubly so if they think it'll be \"funny\" to have your kids drinking behind your back.\n\nWell done for putting your kids first, and breaking that chain of alcohol abuse.", "They ARE alcoholics.  \n\nNTA. And congratulations.", "NTA. They are alcoholics. You want better and your kids deserve better.", "NTA! I'm so proud of you for setting a healthy boundary, protecting your children's health, and breaking the cycle of generational trauma! You are an incredible parent! \ud83d\ude0d", "This is true. And OP, your aunt only has a problem with it because they are alcoholics.. just in denial. If you need to drink everyday and as heavily as your family at every family gathering then you have a problem. It is called alcoholism. Glad you got out. Celebrate your accomplishments with your kids and I get you don\u2019t want them around your family. A bunch of drunks is not a safe place for children to be in.", "Lob a stone into a crowd and the hit dog hollers. Auntie outed herself. NTA", "I was coming to say the same thing. My family drinks over the holidays too but I can't remember a time when anyone was actually *drunk*. At most a bunch are tipsy by the time we start playing cards or left right center, but that's a good 7 hours into the night.", "I do feel like they would eventually try getting my kids to drink , they already try to push boundaries I set for my kids which is another reason I\u2019ve been trying to distance myself and my kids from them.", "I'm tearing up because I can feel how much your love your children through your words. Hug your babies, Momma Bear!"]}
