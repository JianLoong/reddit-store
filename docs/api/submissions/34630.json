She is defending my sister and saying I need to be a good sister and let her use it.\n\nHow about your sister be a good sibling by not throwing parties that get your room trashed, cash stolen and laptop smashed. WTH was she when all that was going on? Why is a 16 year old having parties in the first place??\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Wow. Your sister has a lot of nerve even asking. She has options (library) she is just wanting the easy way out...i.e. via your laptop. I wouldn't do it. The library won't kill her.", "NTA, she *threw you* out of the house, her or her degenerate buddies stole over \u00a31,000 from you and *broke your laptop*. Even *if* she didn't do those things herself, she **allowed that** to happen by throwing you out and letting people raid your room. You don't owe her shit.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. She violated your trust. It's not up to you to forgive her. She has to win that trust back. \n\nWhy don't your parents buy her a laptop on condition that she pay them back? You mentioned savings, so she has money. She can pay them back over time.\n\nAnd instead of \"making excuses\" to her teacher, why not just be honest and say she doesn't have a laptop she can use at home? There may be something the teacher can suggest. Some schools have laptops they loan out, schools have computer labs separate from the library, etc.", "Info:  \nIf it is your laptop (old one or new) how was your sister normally doing her homework?", "NTA. Hell no. Your sister blew her chance at you ever letting her use anything of yours again. She can suck it up and go to the library.", "You are not being selfish. She can go to the public library. Look at what she did!", "How would your sister complete her work if you hadn\u2019t gotten a new laptop? She needs to work with that plan. Do not give in.", "NTA. She only wants it for obvious reasons, and if you don't have a pass on your laptop add one immediately. And, last, if you're getting to the no-choicd point, tell her she has to do her homework infront of you, if she declines, you have an argument.", "NTA.\n\nTell her to use her savings to buy her own laptop. ;)", "NTA - you have a problem with your sister. She feels entitled to have a party, throw you out and let all your stuff being stolen. Are you sure she's not the one that did so? However technically you were the responsible adult in the house as she was a minor so should have called the police or your parents. Why didn't you?\n\nNow, I suspect that because your sister bought your new laptop out of her funds, she feels entitled to it. She doesn't see it as a replacement, or a punishment, because investigation are still happening. \n\nSo bring that up with your mother. Just because she contributed to replacing it, your sister must not be encouraged to believe that theft and replacement means she gets to use the new item. Yes, it is a hassle but it was a hassle you needed it replaced and that was by her actions.", "Nta. Lock that laptop post haste", "YW \ud83d\udcaf NBTA\n\nShe & her friends went into your room,stole from you& trashed your stuff.\n\nNow she's crying because the consequences of those actions are starting to bite.\n\nLet her get her work done in the library. Your mom should also be backing you on this.", "NTA.  I bet you anything that not only did Sister KNOW the friends were gonna go in there, I bet she told them to do it.  And, she probably told them where the money was.   I say that because partly of Reddit Skepticism, but also because she took so long to apologize.  And why wasn't she on board with punishing whoever was guilty?  If it were me, I would have made sure my friends knew what was cool and what wasn't in my house. *If one of my friends went out of their way to go in a room I told them not to, and then deliberately stole things and broke things..... that's not my friend anymore.*  ***That's a criminal.***", "NTA.  Not sure why your mother has changed her tune so suddenly, but in your shoes, I would get a lock for my room and use it.  Your sister can rent a laptop, go to the library or buy her own laptop.", "Give her your old laptop to do the work on. After all, she's responsible for its condition now.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe after she repays you the \u00a31,000 she also owes you you\u2019d think about it. (And then say no anyways.)", "NTA \n\nEven if you put aside the damage she caused, it's your property that you paid for with your own money, she has to listen to you about your property.", "NTA - Sister continues to make poor choices. She could have been at the library or school daily to use a computer long before sobbing for your laptop. Instead she puts energy into lying to the professor, asking to access your property and not meeting her obligations.", "NTA. She absolutely can suck it up and go to the library if she\u2019s that concerned about her assignments.", "NTA\n\n  \nDont trust your sister.\n\n  \ntell your parents to buy her her own laptop.", "NTA\n\nShe could afford her own laptop if she hadn\u2019t allowed your things to get stolen or destroyed. If someone in this family holds her responsible for her actions, maybe she\u2019ll actually learn something.", "What would she have done if you hadn\u2019t replaced the laptop so quickly? She doesn\u2019t need to use it; she wants to use it. No.", "NTA.  Stay strong.  Your sister is a manipulative person.  She can do her homework the old fashioned way, with paper and a pen.  Your parents are very disappointing for not defending you.  SHAME on them!   Why is your sister not punished for throwing a party in the house?  Are your parents weak?  Your sister is clearly out of control and in charge of your household.", "YTA to yourself if you help your sister with anything if she\u2019s punched you before, kicked you out and threatened you.", "INFO\n\n> my younger sister (16F) kicked me (18F) out of my house while my parents were away because she was having a party.\n\nWere you **responsible** for your sister in your parents' absence?\n\n> She was a bad sister for letting people into my room, letting them steal my money and destroying my property.\n\nBecause, NGL, I'm putting **a lot** of blame on you for letting a 16yo have the house to herself for a party.", "INFO: is that the first time? where is her laptop (did she sell it to pay you 1K that was stollen?) Was the apology candid? If answer to everything is yes, I would probably let her use it. You don\u2019t obligated to, but she paid you stollen money and apologized and everyone make mistakes, so maybe it\u2019s time to forgive her? Anyway if you don\u2019t want to, you don\u2019t need.

She has alternatives but doesn't wish to use them.", "16 & 18 is a close age gap, there's probably not much difference in size and weight, and since there were ***other people there,*** it's quite possible they could've assisted the sister in throwing op out of the house and locking them out.", "Guilt tripping/emotional blackmail may be involved", "Hahaha.

She's a lot stronger than me and has punched me before when I refused to leave for her. This is not the first incident. However, she didn't exactly throw me out of the house on this occasion. She told me she didn't want me there and threatened me, but said I could stay in my room if I was quiet.

Even if she didn't do it herself, she needs to find better friends!\n\nYour parents are also TA. If your sister needs a computer to do her work, why is it *your* job to provide one?

She has options. Just because they are not as easy or attractive to her as simply using yours, does not put any obligation on you.\n\nYour mom would do a better job of parenting your sister if she helped your sister understand that these consequences are NOT anyone choosing to be 'mean' to her; they are what naturally happens when she chooses to take liberties with things that are not hers (the whole house) and doesn't take proper care of the things she has made herself responsible for.

Call the police to shut down the party?  call your parents and throw her under the bus?  All valid options...........", "You should've called the police the first time she punched you.\n\nThat's not a safe environment for you. It's best to move asap.", "Holy fucking shit. I'd call the cops on her man, no joke.", "I'm making some assumptions based on you describing $$ amounts in your post, but why doesn't she buy one now? I recently got a perfectly functional renewed gaming laptop off Amazon for under $200. I'm using it for a Big Data ML/AI project so it has 32 gigs of RAM and a respectably sized SSD hard-drive. I suspect your sister doesn't need that much power to do her homework so she could likely spend less. I think you can get a renewed Chrome Book for around $60. There is very little practical reason"]}
