{"id": 6598, "submission_id": "104ifm3", "title": "AITA for not buying my a daughter a new car", "selftext": "My 16 year old daughter's car was wrecked recently. She didn't wreck it, her boyfriend did. I try very hard to have strict boundaries for my daughter without being overly controlling. I got extremely lucky, she never gets in trouble, she's super smart and often joins us on family nights instead of going out with her friends. So when she started seeing this boy, I had to bite my lip. He is a troublemaker, he is the type to be saying the same two lame ass compliments to about 20 different girls and he only wants one thing. But I know if I tell my daughter not to see him, she'll double down. I was a teenager before. Well, I didn't tell her not to see him, but I did tell her, more than once, not to let anyone else drive her car. Especially him. She's a very good driver, as well as you can hope from a 16 year old. I trust her, but not her friends.\n\nNaturally, she didn't listen to me. He sweet talked her into letting him drive and wrapped it around a tree. No one was hurt, thank god, but the car won't start now. My daughter apologized profusely, cried a lot, made many promises she'll forget in two days and has behaved exceptionally well for over a week now. I'm pretty sure she stopped seeing the boy in question, too. Well, until she found out that I had no intention of getting her a new car.\n\nShe begged, pleaded, cried, made promises, offered to earn it, but I'm not budging. There is two ways you learn in this life. You listen to your elders, trusting they have your best interest in mind. Or, much more commonly, you make mistakes, face the consequences and learn from that. That's what I told her. I warned her many times not to let anyone drive her car, not to see that boy and she didn't listen. Now she made the mistake. But if I just buy her a new car, there wouldn't have been any consequences. So no car. Hopefully she'll learn.\n\nNow, she has taken it way better than I excepted. She still makes comments about how much she's inconveniencing me and my wife when we have to drive her, still asks often and there was the usual moody not talking phase. But overall, she is taking it like a champ. It actually weakened my resolve. I always wanted her to have her own car, so she's not dependent on anyone else. But I haven't budget so far. AITA?\n\n***Edit: For those asking, me and the boy's parents worked out a deal. Everyone was glad no one was hurt, no one wanted to get sued, everyone wanted to move on. So that's the least of my worries.***", "created_utc": 1672972961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/104ifm3/aita_for_not_buying_my_a_daughter_a_new_car/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think of \"deserve\" for things like love, dignity, respect, and human rights. Those are things that can't be earned in the first place. I think of \"earn\" for things like lost trust (earn it back with consistent, reliable, right actions), a paycheck (I agree to do certain things or be available at certain times in exchange for money), or with children, lost privileges (eg. be allowed to use the game console again once they have demonstrated the ability to turn off electronics when asked). Putting conditions on the use of an expensive item doesn't imply conditions on one's love or respect for one's children, imo. It is a way of showing them how to demonstrate responsibility.
