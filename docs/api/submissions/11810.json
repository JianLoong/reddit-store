Alcohol use was primarily the cause of the issues and let\u2019s just say it was very very rough growing up. As we grew older, mom straightened out because she realized how it the situation was negatively affecting my sis and I. While my mom got better father got 10x worse. I took the brunt of it. The worst of the situation occurred when my mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness. He made the whole situation about himself and lashed out daily. My mom suggested that it would be safer for me to leave the house. I was 19 at the time. I left and unfortunately shortly after that she passed. I went no contact with my father. A few years passed and he reached out to me and offered up his form of an apology. I told him I forgave him but there was no chance of a father son relationship. We periodically chatted, mostly when he needed to borrow money. FF to about two years ago. My father found out he was terminal and has tried to reach out. I\u2019ve visited him and talked with him but mainly because i don\u2019t want to see anyone go through what my mother did when she was sick. When we found out she was pregnant we told her family and everyone was very happy and although I didn\u2019t want to, she convinced me to tell my father about the pregnancy. Now he keeps saying he can\u2019t wait to see his grandson and whatnot and I told him politely that I don\u2019t plan on bringing him to see you. The wife wasn\u2019t too happy about me saying that, because family is everything to her. She knows the whole situation but it is difficult to for her to completely understand bc thankfully she\u2019s never had to experience what I did. Both her and my in-laws still suggest that we bring our newborn son to meet my father bc he\u2019s sick and it\u2019ll make him happy.

In the end it's up to you, but what would the harm be in introducing him now especially since he is terminal?", "NTA-Family is everything to your wife so she should be listening to her most important family member, you, when it comes to dealing with your father. His being terminally ill doesn\u2019t magically make all his toxic behavior magically disappear or give the two of you a relationship you don\u2019t have with him.", "NTA\n\nRough situation but if I take it at face value that it was as bad as you described, I would probably feel the same, except I wouldn't have continued speaking with him or loaned money after that.", "NTA, but I would still do it.  Your father, because he didn't sound like a dad, is dying and once he goes\n\nYou don't want any regrets to change things within your power to change.", "NTA. A part of you wants to punish him for all the pain and chaos that he caused in your life.

Not just for your sake, but for your son's as well.", "NTA as it's entirely your choice. I would be EXTRA sure though. You don't owe your dad anything, but he is terminal, so this choice is permanent. It's okay to do so, I think, but are you doing this to punish him for being a shitty dad? I don't think that will make anyone happy.", "NTA Your father abused you while growing up and again during your mother's illness but he wants to be apart of his grandson's life? Yes he's apologized but it's a little late for that. Your wife and her family weren't there to see the abuse so they don't understand. Stick to what you feel is right for you and your child.", "NTA. I can speak from experience: It's VERY hard for a partner who hasn't experienced family trauma to \"get it\".

Nah i think you were right in telling him no", "NTA as someone who grew up in an abusive alcoholic household those on the outside have absolutely no clue how bad it gets. Your father is lucky you even give him the time of day, don't let others pressure you into doing anything that makes you that uncomfortable.  Your father never made any effort to make your life any better. I would discuss it with him and explain why you will not be bringing his grandson by, hopefully he'll show a shred of decency and drop it.", "NTA\n\nI appreciate your wife is family orientated BUT she needs to understand that this is not her decision. How she feels about her family is not how you feel about your father because how she was treated by her family is not how you were treated by your father.\n\nNeither she or her parents get a say in this. They are putting their own feelings into it - your wife is thinking in terms of \u201cI\u2019d be devastated not to meet my grandchild\u201d but how she would feel is not relevant because how she would treat her children is not how your father treated you \n\nI\u2019ve been estranged from my mother for a long time. A lot of my dad\u2019s partners found this upsetting because if their daughter cut contact they\u2019d be upset - and the above is always how I\u2019ve tried to help them see. You cannot assume normal family relationships following abuse and neglect", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like things truly were difficult for you growing up, and I understand why you feel this way. Just make sure that you're CERTAIN about this, considering his terminal illness.", "NTA. I imagine from what you say that not introducing your son to your father is a way of protecting him, a physical representation of \"breaking the cycle.\"  Am I correct in that summation?  \n\nIf so, I wouldn't expect your wife or her family (which sounds like a mostly properly functioning family) to understand. They should, however respect your decision in regards to your father and your history with your father. I hope they do.\n\nThere may come a time when you regret not introducing them but this is something you and only you can decide.  Your son obviously will never know the difference, but if there is the slightest chance that such an introduction might facilitate some healing for you personally, then it may be in your best interest to reconsider.", "NTA - as someone who suffered from an alcoholic dad, I wouldn\u2019t expose my children to that. If your wife cares so much about family, she should care about your feelings. However, sitting her down seriously and be vulnerable how badly he hurt you and that it is really irreparable may be good.", "NTA, it's your call. DNA doesn't make you family, love does. Do what you feel comfortable with, not what others pressure you into.", "NTA\u2026 however\u2026 if your wife is adamant, she might visit your father without you to show him the baby. Also your child will be so young that they will have no memory of the visit.", "NTA. Your wife is never going to fully understand why but this sounds like an old, sick man trying to make up for how he screwed up in life. Ultimately, it will up to you but this may be a hill you have to die on.", "NTA - but for YOUR own sake, I would hate for you to carry around the burden for 50 years of not taking your baby to see his biological grandfather perhaps weeks or even days before he died.  If you have one photo of the two of them together I believe it could have a positive effect on your baby's world view one day and most importantly, how he perceives you after he has kids of his own.", "NTA. Your dad is terminal though right? Your son will never remember having met him if you chose to introduce them to one another. Your dad will not live long enough to be any kind of influence on your son. Just food for thought.", "NTA...Just as you respect the relationship your wife enjoys with her family, she needs to respect the relationship dynamic of yours. Your wife is welcome to offer her input, but the ultimate decision is yours, and she has to respect that.", "NTA for your feelings towards your father.  Completely understandable.\n\nAs respects him meeting your newborn, no one has the right to be critical of your decision.  If your dad wasn\u2019t sick and wanted an ongoing relationship with your child I would encourage you to not allow that.\n\nBut death is sometimes the exception to every rule.  All I would suggest is rethink your statements you\u2019ve made.  In some limited ways you have forgiven but not forgotten your dad or you would not keep up even limited contact. And you have some sympathy for his current situation - you don\u2019t want him to go thru what your mom went thru.  You know he won\u2019t be around to damage your child.  So think thru those statements one more time.  If you still feel like you don\u2019t want them to meet once, then stick to your guns, don\u2019t bring it up to your dad again and get on with your life, regardless of what other family wants you to do.  You need to do what feels most healing for you.", "Your dad isn\u2019t contagious, is he?\n\nYour baby is too young to remember any of this. It won\u2019t hurt your baby to be presented to yet another relative. \n\nYou are being difficult. And mean. Get over your problems with your father enough to let him have a little comfort or just leave the dying man alone and cut ties. YTA", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you had a rough time growing up. Losing your mom so young and then dealing with estrangement and ongoing difficulties with your dad. That sucks and I\u2019m sorry that was your experience.\n\nEach of us goes into parenting hoping to be better than what came before, even if our experience was good. It would be easy for me to say that you should take the baby to him and let the past rest.\n\nSome things are hard to set aside. If you don\u2019t want to introduce your baby because you don\u2019t feel your dad deserves that gift and happiness because of the way he was with you, I get that.

You will never forget, nor should you.  Is your father still drinking?  You might want to take that into consideration as to who he was then and now.

It's about allowing your father access to one of the best things that has ever happened to you. During the first part of your life, he failed you as a father and caused a lot of harm. Your son is part of the new life you have created for yourself. You're not comfortable with the two parts of your life interacting and that's perfectly reasonable. \n\nNAH. Based on what you've written, I'm going to assume they mean well. Since they've never experienced what you grew up with, they can't understand your point of view.

However, this is your decision and as long as you do what you feel is best for yourself and your son, you're absolutely not an asshole.", "Why does the father get to have his desire catered to when he never gave a thought to OP?\n\nIt\u2019s not about harm to the baby. It\u2019s about what privileges the dad has earned. He didn\u2019t earn this one.", "What would be the harm if OP doesn\u2019t introduce his baby? Why does the father now get what he desires just because he\u2019s dying?", "I disagree, my father never met his grandson\n\nI **never** let my son near that man, I only considered it in the *very* distant future and only after I got an apology and my son was old enough to physically defend himself if something occurred (obviously I\u2019d be present, but a raging drunk man isn\u2019t easy to handle\u2026)\n\nUnfortunately for him, he died related to alcoholism and the two never met\n\nI don\u2019t regret it, not even for a moment, because with people like that\u2026 they\u2019re literally not worth it\n\nOPs father is STILL being selfish, just like with OPs moms dying/death, just like talking with OP when he needs money, and now\u2026 he\u2019s dying and\u2026 wants something from OP again\n\nI fully support OP\u2019s decision\n\nEdit: formatting", "Not everyone has those regrets, especially if there\u2019s no relationship. Why should OP go out if his way to do something his dad wants when his dad spent his entire life abusing OP? \n\nIt would be one thing if his dad turned his life around before his was dying like his mom did. But no one is entitled to anything, even when dying.", "That is for OP to decide. And how he heals is up to him, not anyone else. If that includes not introducing his son, then that is what it is. No one should tell a survivor of childhood abuse how to heal or when to heal. It\u2019s each individual\u2019s journey.", "It won\u2019t affect the baby at all. My son never met my husband\u2019s bio dad, and he doesn\u2019t care at all. He saw my mom 3 times, the last when he was 3 year old, and he doesn\u2019t remember any of it. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s 16 and we\u2019ve explained the kind of people they were/are. (My mom is still alive.) He understands why he doesn\u2019t know them.

This is a weird take, and sounds like it has no basis in reality, just conservative family talking points.", "Gonna agree with this post. \nThe ONLY reason you're doing it is to hurt your dad, yet you maintain some sort of relationship with him? Your infant won't know any differently. But if you have compassion and have accepted your father's apology enough to have a relationship with him, then it really seems this is just being very cruel for no purpose.", "You had reasons to protect your kid...if this 30 year old man's father is definitely going to die in 2023 then I fail to see what is at stake.", "Of COURSE the baby will not remember someone who died his first year.  I'm talking about the baggage that is carried from one generation to the next.  The photo by itself could be a learning moment for the baby in the future.  One day when he asks about his grandfather just tell the truth: \"Your grandfather added very little positive to my life but rather a lot of pain and abuse.  He realized it too late.  His half apology was not enough to undo any of the damage that he had done.  I only agreed to that photo holding you because it was obvious he was going to be dead in a year.  Don't allow this to happen with any of your kids son!\"  Conservatism has NOTHING to do with this situation.  I could imagine a 30 year old in California, New York, or Illinois taking his new baby for one photo of his dying grandfather.  Why do you impose politics into something that has nothing to do with politics.  Bad fathers exist in every demographic!!!", "Nothing you said here has objective value, you're just insinuating it, and it can be accomplished without the photo regardless so it's a moot point. \n\n>I would hate for you to carry around the burden for 50 years of not taking your baby to see his biological grandfather...\n\nThis is a conservative take. You're placing blood and saving face over logic and personal boundary.", "There will be no baggage because the baby won\u2019t grow up with the dad in his life. The photo won\u2019t add anything. What would the kid learn?", "No, I honestly believe it isn't a conservative take.  Having one photo with a grandfather and a new baby isn't pretending there was a healthy relationship.  It isn't sweeping anything under the carpet.  It isn't putting a gold seal of approval on bad behaviors.  It's just saying that I didn't allow my ongoing feelings of disappointment and resentment dictate my choice at the very end of this admittedly flawed man's life.  Keep in mind if the 30 year old had said there was sexual molestation or actual physical violence I would have not given this same advice.  In those two circumstances I do believe the dying man needs to wallow in his failures alone on his death bed.", "The kid would learn that it wasn't the 30 year old's doing that there was still a bad relationship.  Maybe I am putting more importance on a very symbolic gesture than there will be but I fail to see the harm in it if the old man is actually going to die in 2023.  A lot of people have said to just allow the mom and the baby to go visit alone once.  I don't have a problem with that either.", "NIA - i understand every person in this situation.

And it sounds like he was a monster in yours.\n\nSoon he will die. He will be gone from your life and the life of your child. Forever. \n\nDeath kills your father's chance to redeem himself.

It was a difficult decision that I really struggled with.  And it did cost me some things, dealing with him was always very very stressful.  My brother kind of went through this about 5 years behind me, at one point he was fine with my dad and defensive of him, then went NC with my dad.

What I'm suggesting is, showing your dad a bit of kindness right before he dies may not be a favor for him, but something you do for yourself.
