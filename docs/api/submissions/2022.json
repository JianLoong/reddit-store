Our family is complicated and also having a kid at 17 is hard and I understand why she was not a good mother but she was still very much not a good mother. I mean, when I was still living at home she'd sometimes just drop Jane off with us \"for the afternoon\" and then just be gone and post pictures of herself on roadtrips or some shit then be back weeks later.

After my sister died, obviously it stopped and it's taken a while for Jane to talk about her at all but recently she's started talking to me about it and there's just a lot of guilt there about having been mad at her so often and I've just kind of tried to give her the same space as before, one where she gets to talk badly about her mother without being shamed for it. And, yeah, I've talked badly about her too. I clearly have opinions about it and I have my own stories of how genuinely vile she could be that I've told Jane. \n\nIt's mostly that last part that I'm being called an AH for by Jane's dad.

They should be in quality therapy and you should be following the therapists suggestions in how you discuss the deceased. Kids cycle through stages of grief. They will idolize their lost parent for periods of time and then they will turn around and demonize them for leaving them, or for how they treated them while alive. It's a normal process for them and what they need is a stable, secure message about their dead parent that neither paints them as a monster nor glosses over the bad part. There are ways to acknowledge the bad behavior that are neutral and that will not disregard what the kid has gone through. It does not sound like you are discussing her mom in that way. Please seek some sort of therapy to assist not only her daughter, but the entire family to learn how to best address this. Hospice organizations can even point you to free options for this.

His first wife left because he was a violent drunk (likely due to PTSD from military service but back then -1960's - it didn't exist) and she didn't want their daughter growing up to think that life was normal.(This was before I was born).\n\nWhen my uncle remarried, he went on to have 4 more daughters, all of whom saw the drunk, vile, and violent behaviour he was capable of but my aunt refused to leave him, even though he also cheated repeatedly through over 50 years of marriage.We have multiple family gathering photos where my aunt has terrible make up covering worse bruises and I grew up with the family members who tried to protect her or get her out talking about the times the police were called or he was thrown out of somewhere. (He did mellow as he aged, but he was who he was.) My aunt\u2019s influence meant he abandoned his oldest child and even gave one of the younger ones her name and nickname...I know, he was a real peach! \n\nAs I grew up, my family spoke about my oldest cousin and I almost thought of her as a fantasy character because I was never sure she really existed, until my uncle died. She reached out to a family member through a social media post about my uncle's death, asking if it was him because noone had contacted her about her dad dying...And the proverbial hit the fan.\n\nThree of my four cousins gave an ultimatum of \"them or her\" and tried to turn the wider family against me and my dad...it didn't work. They persist, even now, nearly 10 years later with this ridiculous fiction of their parents' perfect love story and him being this amazing, gentle, caring, thoughtful man who only had eyes for their mum. \n\nIn reality, my uncle had been those good things, and had capacity to be the good things but he rarely was. I understand his daughters and grandchildren wanting to remember the good, but trying to force false memories on those of us who knew better or differently isn't healthy for anyone. I can only imagine that it's completely exhausting to keep up the pretence.\n\nThe 3 cousins cut all contact but the relationships we gained from getting to know my oldest cousin have been amazing. She and her mum had a really hard time as she grew up but there's no doubt, they were better off and her mum is one of the bravest women I wish I could have met.\n\nNo person is perfect, and making their memory a superhero doesn't do them justice, it just makes them impossible to live up to.

I told her about the fun times with him, even if they were old ones. I had his aunts talk about the fun and goofy times with him as a kid. They sent pictures of him and wrote letters to include the story that went with the picture. \n\nWhen she was a teen, I did have to discuss the circumstances around her father's death some. He was a drug and alcohol addict. He got into his car accident because he was drunk and high on meth and drove. I also told her that her father had demons. He had mental health issues. I told her that unfortunately his demons won. \n\nShe has depression and anxiety, as do a lot of kids who lose a parent young. I felt it was important that she know the family history of addiction. It was also important that she see what intoxicated driving can do. \n\nI had her in grief counseling. Her counselor actually gave me some homework to help her too.

It wasn't so much based on age as where in her healing process she was. \n\nMy own daughter has thanked me for not telling her the negative stuff until she was older and handling her mental health better. She said if she had known all the bad right away, it really would have affected her self worth more.", "YTA - you have the right to say what you want about your sister. But, truth be told\u2026something feels kind of icky about what you\u2019re doing. Your niece is still a child and is struggling through complex emotions and feelings from her mom being a teenage mother and dying. While validating your niece\u2019s feelings and being an outlet for her is definitely important, you seem to be solely adding to the negative memories of her mother. Since your niece is so young and impressionable, this seems\u2026.wrong. It\u2019s like a bad parent going through a divorce who poisons their child against the other parent by telling them all of the bad things the other parent did. Your sister may have been a crappy parent but it sounds like you are struggling with reconciling your own feelings about you sister. You may not be ready to be your nieces sounding board.", "NTA being dead doesn't make one a saint or change the actions one took before their death.", "My problem is that OP was bad mouthing the sister BEFORE she died to her niece. Like really? It reads more like OP was using the niece as a counselor to vent her frustrations with her sister. \n\nWhen complaining about a parent, alive or dead, you NEVER complain to a child about THIER parent, like really? I mean OP says that when the sister was alive she would explain to her niece, who by the way under that age 12, that what sis was doing wasn't normal. I can't imagine the torment this child was feeling by the truck loads of crap OP was feeding her. I am 100% in dad's corner here. OP needs counseling and to be cut out of the niece's life. YOU NEVER BADMOUTH A PARENT TO A MINOR CHILD!", "the mother dumped of jane and went to parties. i think OP is allowed to vent about it too with the kid.", "I disagree... Children adapt to their environment, it's why so many adults don't realise they were in abusive situations /homes. If no one is telling them that those behaviours are abusive and bad, how are they supposed to know?\n\nOp was giving child a safe space to express emotions about how her mother was treating her and behaving towards her. If she didn't know that wasn't acceptable, how is she going to learn? If everyone around you acts like those behaviours are completely normal, you'll grow up letting others treat you that way too, because you think it's normal. It isn't. From friends, family, parents or strangers. \n\n(hopefully someone better with words will come along and explain this better than I can!)", "Helping an abused and neglected child keep their \"normal meter\" intact is completely fine.", "You\u2019re either the crap parent who got talked about or you had a perfect family; if that parent is doing abusive things and abandoning their child for extended periods then the kid doesn\u2019t need to be told it\u2019s sunshine and roses. She had a younger family member who also dealt with the whims of her mom who could understand - outside of a therapist, that\u2019s an ideal discussion partner.", "Nta. Don't listen to the others, pointing out you talked about your sister before she passed. You were a child yourself. You did and are doing your best.", "Good job OP! You helped you niece develop those terrible memories of her mom by \"Anyways, when my sister was alive, I'd try to talk to Jane about some of this and just explain that it wasn't actually normal for her to act like that.\" \n\nYou actively BADMOUTHED your sister to her very young child! Your niece was not even 12! This really sounds/feels like you were project your personal feelings into the situation, rather than being a listening/sounding board for your niece. \n\nI am so glad you were not my \"helpful\" auntie! My mom was a piece of work and shitty, but NOONE went out of there was to tell 10 year-old me that my mom was shitty. No one went out of their way to taint the good memories with the bad. I am not excusing your sister but can anyone imagine the outrage if OP was a daycare worker or a teacher telling a minor child that their mom is shitty?", "I think you explained it very well yourself. Thank you! I was that little girl who very much needed to hear this. Fortunately, I got to see my mother eventually deal with her issues and become a much better grandmother to my girls.", "Helpful Auntie was a child herself. NTA", "I was in my 30s before anyone told me, so I guess this hit me quite hard. I've also had a similar situation with my niblings recently so it's really driven it home to me, that people need to be TOLD that these things aren't okay... I wish someone would've told me when I was young, so I wouldn't of spent my life thinking I was crazy.\n\nI'm really glad your mother is dealing with her issues, and is better for your girls. So many people excuse their behaviour, it's great when people actually try to change it. I hope she is better for you too though \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta\n\nPeople don't become saints as soon as they pass. Part of remembering a person is remembering all of them, flaws and all.", "NTA. Sis being dead doesn\u2019t make her a great mom. Dad needs to get niece therapy to work through her feelings but trying to rewrite history won\u2019t work. Niece remembers well that she wasn\u2019t a great mom, and the guilt about being angry so often is understandable.", "We can talk about whether it is appropriate or inappropriate for you to respond to your niece's stories about being hurt by her mother with your own stories in support.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  I am not a child psychologist or family therapist, so I don't know.\n\nBut even if it actually is inappropriate, it wouldn't be far enough to make you an asshole.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nDon't speak ill of the dead? Geez. Not if the dead was a crap person. \n\nI mean we do it all the time. History books, anyone?", "NTA please continue to let her vent and get those feelings out, she will thank you for it. As she gets older it will be easier to see her mother as a flawed human instead of a monster. Jane will be able to let go of the anger. If she has to be nice and keep these feelings in she will start to hate herself. Plus your are saving her a big therapy bill later on. Believe me. There are things I want to talk about from my childhood that I can't get past but no one in my family will listen, they tell me it's in the past. No it's not in the past it's actively in my soul now..", "NTA - As long as you are speaking the truth I don't see you as an AH. Just because someone dies doesn't mean that everything they did in their life was good.", "NTA. It's OK, even healthy, for Jane to be validated in her feelings about her mother, but it's also important to remember that sometimes kids internalize negative statements that they hear from others about their parents (living or not) and wonder if the person saying this things feels that way about them, too. That may be why Jane's dad is so upset about the way you're talking about Jane's mother. \n\nI think Jane just really needs to talk to a therapist to process what she went through, being emotionally abused and then abandoned (when her mother passed.) It's a lot for anyone to go through, let alone a kid.", "I agree that OP giving her niece space to talk and vent is very kind of her. But, I don't think it is helpful to, in essence, vent back to a 15 year old kid about their dead mom. I get OP's rationale - in theory - but it has to be balanced. \n\nI'm not sure if it is helpful to add OP's negative experiences into the mix. Let the daughter talk since she ready seems to be comfortable doing so. Listen. Be there for her. I suspeect OP may need to get some of these stories off of her chest, too. But, that should be done with another adult or a therapist.", " Nope my mother had her shitty moments including kicking 12 year-old me out on Thanksgiving in nothern Indiana in nothing but a t-shirt, shorts and sandals because we did not read her mind and put the dishes away.", "I think you're missing the part where the mom was actually really quite shitty. Like, not in a \"mom is so mean\" way but in a pretty terrible way. At some point it crosses a line.\n\nAssuming OP tells like, three quarters of the truth, a daycare worker or teacher might've been required to report certain things in the post. So yeah, a daycare worker or teacher would have done that and likely done a lot more to intervene.", "She is! We call each other everyday, and I genuinely look forward to speaking with her most days.", "YTA\nYou're not qualified to offer the counseling she needs, and you're completely out of line for having these conversations with someone else's child.\nI would not be surprised if dad goes N/C with you, to protect his daughter.\nI would.\nMy son can say negative things about his dad, if those are his feelings.\nI NEVER let anyone bad mouth his dad, around him, nor would I EVER do it myself.\nYou should get in counseling, and keep those thoughts private. Don't pile them onto a child.\nYour anger is your baggage.\n\nI would have said N T A if you hadn't shared your own \"horrible\" stories.", "NTA. But I also come from a family that had a quote saying if they\u2019re a bastard when they\u2019re alive, they\u2018re a bastard when they\u2019re dead.

Just because she\u2019s dead doesn\u2019t mean she never made any bad choices during her lifetime. But you and Jane should try and see a therapist. It may help you both unload your traumas and be generally happier", "NTA. You are an outlet for your Niece. She\u2019s simply venting about HER experience with her Mom. In my opinion it\u2019s not speaking ill of the dead, it\u2019s speaking the truth which often times hurt.", "Nta it's not so much that you're talking badly about your sis, but you're validating your neice's emotions.  Dying doesn't make someone a saint.", "NTA", "NTA I absolutely hate that people turn into saints and martyrs because they have died. Dying does not make you a good person!", "Yeah my dad was one of those. My mom was loved by all.

Jane is a child. \n\nBoth are allowed to have their feelings, but it is completely inappropriate for OP to use Jane as a confidant and feed more fuel into the fire. \n\nThis sub loves to harp on abusive relationships. What the OP is doing is definitely in abuse territory. Children are not adults. OP is treating a child like an adult friend. This is not okay. \n\nNo one is saying Jane shouldn't be allowed to process and share her angry feelings. No one is saying OP shouldn't be allowed to process and share her feelings. No one is saying OP should gaslight Jane or lie/sugarcoat how the sister was. How it is currently being handled is extremely inappropriate and will have consequences down the line. I think the OP knows that and its why she's asking. \n\nThis will 100% breed resentment (and rightfully so) between OP and Jane. If OP wants to help Jane she needs to stop relying on a CHILD to process her own feelings and go find another adult.", "Oh, so it\u2019s Stockholm syndrome and being taught not to rock the boat. I\u2019m sorry you internalized that. There should have been an adult that you could be open with about your mothers neglect, like OP was for her niece."]}
