I was living with them at the time, had been for two years and was mostly the person taking care of my niece in the afternoons since I got out of work before my sister. I'd been babysitting a lot when I was in highschool too, I'd say I've had a pretty big hand in taking care of her since I was like 13. \n\nAfter my sister died, the dad got custody so I see Jane a lot less now, although I try to visit a lot and I am still mostly who she comes to with her problems or to rant.\n\nNow, I loved my sister. Our family is complicated and also having a kid at 17 is hard and I understand why she was not a good mother but she was still very much not a good mother. I mean, when I was still living at home she'd sometimes just drop Jane off with us \"for the afternoon\" and then just be gone and post pictures of herself on roadtrips or some shit then be back weeks later. She was also just *mean* to Jane unprompted, she always had a really short temper and it was clear she didn't have the patience to deal with a kid being a kid. \n\nAnyways, when my sister was alive, I'd try to talk to Jane about some of this and just explain that it wasn't actually normal for her to act like that and that she didn't deserve to be insulted like that and just give her a space where she got to actually be mad at her mom since people act like not worshipping the ground your mother walks on is insane. After my sister died, obviously it stopped and it's taken a while for Jane to talk about her at all but recently she's started talking to me about it and there's just a lot of guilt there about having been mad at her so often and I've just kind of tried to give her the same space as before, one where she gets to talk badly about her mother without being shamed for it. And, yeah, I've talked badly about her too. I clearly have opinions about it and I have my own stories of how genuinely vile she could be that I've told Jane. \n\nIt's mostly that last part that I'm being called an AH for by Jane's dad. He contacted me recently essentially to scold me for speaking ill of the dead and for encouraging Jane to say that my sister wasn't a good mother to her. And, listen, I won't apologize for letting Jane talk to me about her own feelings but maybe it was too much to actually give my input there.

They should be in quality therapy and you should be following the therapists suggestions in how you discuss the deceased. Kids cycle through stages of grief. They will idolize their lost parent for periods of time and then they will turn around and demonize them for leaving them, or for how they treated them while alive. It's a normal process for them and what they need is a stable, secure message about their dead parent that neither paints them as a monster nor glosses over the bad part. There are ways to acknowledge the bad behavior that are neutral and that will not disregard what the kid has gone through. It does not sound like you are discussing her mom in that way. Please seek some sort of therapy to assist not only her daughter, but the entire family to learn how to best address this. Hospice organizations can even point you to free options for this.

You're giving her a more truthful view. I'd be balanced about it somewhat, but the girl should be feeling guilty for being mad about I'll treatment. She needs to process that.", "Let Jane talk about her mum but do not ever say bad things about your sister to Jane. \n\nDon\u2019t put her mum down.", "YTA. \n\nJane was 12 when her mom passed. She knows exactly what kind of mother she had, but I'm sure it wasn't all bad (thus the guilt and confusion). \n\nYou can be supportive and validate Jane's feelings without trash talking your sister. I'm all for not turning every dead person into a Saint, but this isn't how to do it. \n\nIt sounds like you have your own issues to work out about her, but you need to do that with someone who is 1. not a literal child and 2. not HER child. \n\nI do think it's great for you to give Jane a judgment free place to vent all her feelings, but you need to keep your opinions out of it. If you cannot be objective and neutral, then she needs to get that support somewhere else.", "Yta.  Your role is to listen and maybe to answer specific questions.  No negative reminiscing.", "YTA. As someone who lost a parent at a young age and had people talk bad about him to me, it  screwed me up well into adulthood. It\u2019s one thing to let her vent to you but you never should have bad mouthed her mom to her. I had angry feelings towards my dad for many many reasons, and it was one thing for me to voice them, but to have other people talk crap about him was completely different. It made it VERY confusing to me. I started to question whether or not there was any good in him because of all the bad stuff family said about him. It felt wrong and I felt guilty for having good memories of him. I was 11 when he died and around 14 when people decided I was old enough for them to talk crap about him to me. Well into my 20s before realizing he was both good and bad.", "INFO: what kinds of bad things are you saying about your sister? It's one thing for you to honestly answer any questions or affirm Jane's feelings, it's another to share your opinions that might not help her.", "NTA. Jane\u2019s dad can be mad, but the whole \u201cdon\u2019t speak ill of the dead\u201d thing is bogus. You aren\u2019t talking shit about her; you\u2019re venting about very real issues that you would vent about if she were still with us.", "NTA but I would be careful. I've observed something similar in your situation and emotions are complicated when it's a child and a parent. The child might over relate to the parent and internalise the negative traits from the bad being spoken about them. Having said that, from what you've written she's probably got a lot to process in regard to her mother. It sounds like you're doing what you can to allow her to feel what she needs to feel by being a sounding board that answers what is asked of you as an aunt.", "Nta it\u2019s good to not put the dead on a pedestal, she was human. If she wants to know about her mom she deserves to know her as she was flaky and fun loving. Tell her the good things about her mother too tho maybe you have a thousand times but it\u2019s still nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd.", "NAH. Janes mother was not ready to be parent and unfortunately jane had to see the result of that. Get this girl to therapy and let a professional help her with the complicated feelings that come with less than stellar parenting", "A bit if an AH. You should have let your niece talk about the negative things she says. You should not commented about her at all.  As far as the Dad was concerned. Where was he at when all this was going on? He should have been the one raising her and not your Sis.", "NTA but you should leave your bias out of it. If Jane asks for validation about negative memories then thats fine but it isnt your queue to start venting about your own.", "NAH.  \n\n\nYou are doing great by giving your niece a safe space to process her feelings without judgement.  \n\n\nI'm unclear as to whether or not the father and your sister were a couple at the time of her passing, but at the very least I'm sure he cared for her as the mother of his child. He's grieving, and trying to do right by his grieving child. I'm sure he's scared that Jane could be negatively psychologically impacted by rehashing these things that she will never be able to find closure for.  \n\n\nIn the end, there is no one right way to grieve and move on. Your niece has expressed that being able to talk openly and honestly about how things actually were, instead of sugar-coating them out of respect for the dead, has helped her feel normal about having conflicting emotions surrounding her mother. That is huge.  \n\n\nIf she were younger, I might say to listen to her father's wishes. But she's 15. She's old enough to choose for herself how she deals with her own emotions and own brain. So I'd say continue to do what you're doing.", "Nta. It's the truth. But she's dead already, there's no use talking bad about her anyway.", "Nta", "Do you think you were a comfort to Jane who is living with guilt, right now? Jane's perspective is warped by grief.

NTA", "NTA there\u2019s nothing wrong with giving her a safe space to work through these complicated feelings but i would watch the line between empathising with her and getting out your own grievances with your sister to a fifteen year old. it would probably help jane to know some good stories of her mother caring and loving her as well so she understands everyone is complicated and despite not being great i\u2019m sure her mother did love her. also i\u2019d wholeheartedly suggest therapy for yourself if you haven\u2019t been doing so already because it sounds like you went through a lot that shouldn\u2019t have been put on you!", "> scold me for speaking ill of the dead\n\nLike Charles Manson?

I think providing a balanced perspective is key. Niece knew that her mom wasn't a great one, hence the guilt.

I feel like as long as you acknowledge to her daughter of not just your sister's behaviour, but also her circumstances that lead her to be one so that the full picture (where the mom is both good and bad in different ways) is presented to her daughter, it should be alright (so you shouldn't talk of only the bad stuff with the daughter, but rather a combination)", "There is no part of my comment that recommended lying.

You aren't. You're giving your neice space to process the emotions she has because she was raised by a negligent mother.", "INFO: How often are you \"speaking your truth\" about your sister to Jane? Are you balancing it with any good memories to show her as a full, complicated person? Or are you just endlessly shit-talking a dead woman?\n\nMy mother and aunt hated each other. Aunt wound up being more of a mother and raising me until she got very ill and died when I was 10. My mother was fine with that arrangement, yet complained about how awful aunt was at every opportunity. For decades, every chance she got, she'd still trash my aunt for whatever. That infuriated me, because my memories consisted of aunt being the one to do all the childhood maternal things my own mother couldn't be bothered with. I was grieving the loss of a maternal figure, and the real mother was needlessly complicating my grief with her own bullshit. \n\nFinally, I had enough and said that aunt has been dead for 30 years, I didn't think she's done anything to mother lately and it was time to let it go.\n\nNo, you should not paint your sister as a saint. She wasn't. You should give Jane the space to talk about a complicated relationship with her mother, and accept the reality that she's gone. But there are times when you should just STFU and not pile on to a CHILD processing all the emotions and guilt of grieving a mother who wasn't that spectacular.", "Op isn't responsible for her having access to therapy.

I never understood why it shouldn't be ok to say the dead person was an asshole.
