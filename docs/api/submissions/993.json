He wasn\u2019t the most productive worker, but he mostly left me alone and never micromanaged or knew what I was doing, which is my preferred method of management. I ended up switching departments but we remained cordial and kept monthly mentorship meetings. I actually much preferred his management style to my current boss who, while extremely competent, is always frazzled and in my business.\n\nAnyways about 9 months ago, we had a bunch of lay-offs. Unfortunately, ex-boss was part of the layoff group. We had lunch before his last day, in which he asked I look out for a role for him and I said I would keep an eye out. He was a director before he was laid off. \n\nHe reached out to me on LinkedIn about 4 months ago inquiring about a Director role on my team. I said I would ask about it, and I did. I forwarded his resume to my current boss and told her that he was interested. She recognized his name, scrunched up her nose and said that this might not be the best match for him. She then offered up some empty Manager roles on our team that he could apply for. I knew his ego would not like this information, but I figured I would let him know of the open roles anyways since he was currently jobless. He, as expected, declined the Manager roles (and seemed a little offended I offered them to him). \n\nAbout a month ago, I had my end of year review, got excellent marks and offered a promotion to Director.  This role was basically replacing the open Director role on our team, its a different job code, but they did close out the open Director role, I guess they didn\u2019t like any of the candidates. \n\nThis is where I maybe fucked up. I updated my LinkedIn to Director, without informing my old boss first. To be honest, it had been so long since he reached out to me, it didn\u2019t even cross my mind how this would look to him.  He saw it, congratulated publicly but then texted me a slew of angry messages. How he can\u2019t believe I stabbed him in the back like this when he always had my back. And that I had purposefully interfered with his application for the Director role so I could hog it for myself. He also said that I didn\u2019t need the Director role as I already had a job with the company but that he did and it was my fault he was still jobless.\n\nNot going to lie, his messages stung, and I was feeling petty. So I responded, \u201cI tried my best to help you with the director role, I was told you were not a good match. I never applied for that role, I was simply promoted. However, I do still have some open manager roles on my team if you\u2019re interested\u201d. He told me to fuck off. \n\nTLDR: Ex Boss did not get director role, I did instead.

The person to whom you referred his resume made it perfectly clear he wouldn\u2019t be considered. You did what you said you would, and went above in telling him about the manager positions.

You got it cause you deserve it. Nicely done.", "NTA you tried to help. He made assumptions.", "NTA. Even if he had been a Director, he isn't NOW and if he's unemployed, any job with a salary beats no job. \nPlus he was the AH for jumping on you like that, pretty much his insecurities because you got a job he would have wanted but didn't get. You didn't take the previous job he applied for, this was a different spot and you don't owe him to refuse the promotion. Did he expect you to tell management \"Don't promote me, hire back *old boss* and give him this position and they would do it?", "Yeah he's kind of unprofessional. Possibly some relevant information I shouldve included in OP, but part of the reason I do feel guilty was that he WAS a good boss. Not at doing actual work, but at least from protecting me from upper management and advocating for me.

And he always made, slightly out of touch comments about how sexism was hurting his career progression and implied I had a leg up because I was a woman. Which sure, middle management is very female dominated, but all the C-level folks are still white men. I always brushed off his comments as I knew how it felt to be the only woman on my team, but now cant shake off the idea that somehow he thought he deserved more because he was a man...\n\nit does suck cuz i feel like i bought into his facade of a being a good boss until this very moment.", "That is priceless.  So then it stings that he thinks you did him wrong.  That is tougher than some random person.  Maybe you can let him cool down and reach out again, reassure him that you didn't sabotage him in any way.  Good luck.", "Ding ding ding!  He was a good boss as long he never imagined you as a peer, NTA.", "When the best thing you can say about him as a boss is that he enabled *you* to do the work without interference, I think that tells you all you need to know about why they\u2019d rather work with you than him.", "And that's the *real* reason he got so angry. How dare *you*, a *woman* take HIS job. It's now *your* fault that he's jobless, as opposed to simply not having gotten this particular job.\n\nYou are very much NTA.\n\n(And I loved that zinger response, telling him their are manager roles available. That was an excellent \"Finish him!\" blow to his wounded ego. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude05)"]}
