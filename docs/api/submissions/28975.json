{"id": 28975, "submission_id": "178ke3r", "title": "AITA for leaving my mom's birthday dinner early after my cousin insulted me?", "selftext": "This is my second AITA post and a semi-followup to my first one + my other posts on my account.\n\nFor those not in the know, here's a quick recap: I (23 male) have been slowly reconnecting with my parents (male and female both 54) after I was framed by my brother (19 male) for stealing from my dad. Since I began interacting with them more, we have all (including my brother, my parents have un-disowned him after I had to vouch for him, saying that running away from your mistakes only make them worse) started therapy and I have my debts from school paid off.\n\nMy mom's birthday dinner was yesterday evening and I decided to go because they were eating at an expensive restaurant and they offered to pay my way fully (free food sounded good to me). Those that were there were me, my sister, my brother, my parents, my uncle and his wife (mom's side, both mid 40s) and their twins (19 male and female). I've always gotten along with their son but their daughter, who will be called R, has despised me for as long as I can remember.\n\nMy dad was pulling out his wallet for his I.D so he could get a drink and R said, in a mocking manner, \"Uh oh (my dad's name), hide your wallet, you don't want (my name) getting in there.\" I looked at her, red in the face and embarrassed, and said something along the lines of \"Your girl best friends have to say that to every guy in your friend group because of how you get around.\" (She is a known cheater.)\n\nShe got upset and started crying and my uncle started berating me for talking to his daughter like that and that I was still \"on thin ice\" for what I was framed for. I got angry, flipped him off, and left the restaurant. I called my dad and he said that I have nothing to apologize for but my mom wants me to because she wants to keep the peace between her side of the family and ours. My uncle texted me demanding an apology and R put a post out on instagram about \"toxic family members\". This is where I come to you again. Reddit, AITA?\n\nJust a little more context to my background: I was punished and neglected from my mid teenage years up until I moved out because of what my brother did to me and it left me with trauma and trust issues from everyone around me. I'm usually level headed but everyone knows that what happened is a very sensitive subject.\n\nMini Update: Just got off the phone with my aunt (R's mom) and she gave me the most sincere apology that I've recieved in the past month. She said she has dealt with R and my uncle (don't know how) but R did take down the post and my uncle did send me a single \"Sorry.\"", "created_utc": 1697391037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178ke3r/aita_for_leaving_my_moms_birthday_dinner_early/", "score": 807, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was an excellent comeback. If your mom wants to keep\npeace in the family, she should try to do it by telling her side of the family that they can\u2019t treat her son like that, not by pressuring you to apologize for them being nasty to you.", "Info: K so you were framed for stealing and now they know that it wasnt you? Or did everyone get over it while still thinking it was you?\n\nWhy vouch for your brother if that whole situation is still lingering? Sounds like he needs to still make ammends. \n\nYour cousin sounds like a piece of work, and while you sunk to her level, she may have deserved it. Still, you may find a more mature approach serves you better.", "NTA. Fuck keeping the peace. She deserved it.", "NTA.\n\nYour family are clearly not supporters and your parents clearly don't have trust for you despite your innocence in the matter! Advice: Throw away the brother and the girl(R)!\n\nJokes aside tho I suggest you keep a bit of a distance from them as being around toxic people is not good for your or anyone's mental health for that matter but then again your choice!", "Tell your mom if saving face with her crappy family members is more important that her relationship with her own child, then you know where you stand with her.  Then block her and get on with your life.", "Nta. I saw that you said R knows you were framed, so to me she was looking for a fight when she said that. Unfortunately, you fell right into her trap and now she's playing victim bc you snapped back. \n\nMaybe apologize to your mom for not being able to ignore the shit stirring. However, I wouldn't apologize to R.", "NTA.  Your uncle can get bent if he ever expects to get an apology.   His family owe you an apology.", "NTA. This is a case of not being able to take what you dish out - your cousin asked for what you gave her, especially since they know you were innocent of what you were accused of. Especially since those wounds are still so newly healed, what she said was even more tasteless. And your uncle just kept digging the hole your cousin started digging.\n\nYour father was right - you have nothing to apologize for. Your family attacked you first. And you did good leaving before things escalated, since it seems your uncle & cousin were looking for a fight. I think your mom needs to be more concerned with defending you than keeping the peace - this will tell her family that she believes you were framed, supports your innocence, and won't accept these sorts of attacks on you. You apologizing will simply say that these sorts of things are acceptable, and they shouldn't be.\n\nAnd it isn't you who are toxic - you didn't start it. It is the toxic people who took the fight to social media to try to win the argument via pee pressure because they know they can't win otherwise.", "NTA, your cousin and uncle deserved that, your father being on your side is very good, in your place i'll say to your mother that she is on thin ice for how she's treating you, your cousin and uncle were aholes, she should've urged them to apologize,  not you. Btw excellent comeback, good job putting that 403 in her place.", "NTA. Love the comeback. Tell your mom that you are not going to apologize. You don't owe anything to these people.", "NTA. Go NC ASAP.", "NTA. \n\nI read your post history. While flipping someone off isn\u2019t great and I\u2019m not thrilled with the \u201cgetting around\u201d comment I\u2019m giving you a pass on that. Your brother framed you, causing your parents to neglect you. Let\u2019s assume they believed you stole because the shit was always in your room (a pretty reasonable initial response) it\u2019s odd that they only decided to get cameras after it happened to your sister. I can understand why, but it would still be irritating. And cutting you off vs taking away your brothers phone is messed up. \n\nSo R brought up a painful incident that she KNEW was a lie and where she KNEW your brother had victimized you. Something that is still raw for you. You snapped and retaliated with a true, if unkind, statement. So as such you get a pass and my vote if not the asshole. If you wanna be the bigger person you can apologize for how you expressed yourself but let them know that what they said was unacceptable and you will not tolerate that kind of behavior from them. But it\u2019s not a moral failing if you don\u2019t.", "So if your cousin really does know you're innocent why did she make the remark about the wallet. Are you sure she actually knows the truth.", "I don't have a judgment to make here.  I guess if I have to, I'd say that this is above reddit pay grade, please get help from someone who can help you process things better than the keyboard warriors of reddit who are quick to make snap judgments without knowing the full story. \n\nYour entire family is so dysfunctional its ridiculous. \n\nI don't think its a matter of who is the AH here, its a matter of who is willing to get therapy, and will it work if the other family members don't get help for their issues.\n\nGood luck op, I wish you the best", "Hmm. NTA. If your cousin can\u2019t take it, then don\u2019t dish it out.", "Your Mum clearly hasn\u2019t told her side of the family that you were framed because they clearly still blame you for it. NTA. Your mum needs to step up and tell the truth", "ESH. You all need to grow up. What a dysfunctional family you sound like.", "NTA - If your parents truly want you to be part of the family again after all the crap they have put you through (based on your post history), they would have kicked your cousin and uncle out for insulting you. It seems like the extended family is hanging on to the past lies. Your parents need to clear the air, and if that means going low contact with people who still hang on to the past mis-truths, so be it.", "NTA\n\nYour father supports you, your mother just wants \"peace\" at your expense. Your cousin meanwhile is a disgusting person with an enabling toxic father who is holding you in contempt for something you didn't fucking do, which he likely knows. I can't see why you'd at all feel bad about her crocodile tears or his anger.", "NTA", "NTA. Go back to low if not no contact...", "NTA, seems to me her father thinks it's ok for to insult you,but your not allowed to retaliate. reply to the text from her father saying you won't apologise until she does. Seems childish, but she needs to be held accountable for her actions to.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nSend this to your mom and tell her that you're getting off the boat. So she'll just have to steady harder.\n\n[Don't Rock the Boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)", "NTA\n\nSorry your mom can't see the forest for the trees. She really should understand that you suffered a horrible injustice that she should not allow anyone to use against you. As if something that is undeniably false can be held against someone. \n\nYou could apologize to the uncle. \"Uncle, I am so sorry from the bottom of my heart that cousin is what she is.\"", "NTA.  She wanted to run her mouth. Did she expect you to just lay down and take it? \n\nYou could always text your uncle and tell him that you're sorry that his daughter gets around.", "Vouched for my brother because they were planning to cut him off like they almost did me when I and now our therapist thinks he has serious underlying issues.\n\nEveryone knows that I am innocent in stealing yes.", "OP just managed to slowly get better and has been doing his best to try to mend the relationships that were broken through no faulf of his own. This is not a good time to go advise blocking.", "Yes she knows the truth, my parents made a public apology on facebook and my entire family reacted to it, including hers which was just a \ud83d\udc4d", "I agree with this comment the most\n\nLooking back I couldve handled the situation waaaay better but my emotions took hold", "Read the post history. He is not the one who has to grow up.", "In that case you owe no-one an apology.", "Absolutely not, your family sounds awful. It\u2019s amazing you\u2019ve been the bigger person this long but everyone cracks at some point.", "NTA. I applaud your remark to your cousin. \ud83d\ude02", "Nta tell your mom she really needs to stand up for her own child more. Cousin made a joke that was based on a lie. Uncle naturally defended his child however if his child kept her mouth closed it wouldn't be a problem. Tell your uncle you're not apologizing for speaking the truth when his child spoke nothing but lies.", "NTA and fuck your uncle, your cousin and anyone else who \"demands\" an apology from you.\n\nIt's R who owes you an apology.", "I don\u2019t understand why your parents aren\u2019t more pissed off on your behalf. I\u2019d be livid. Hell, I\u2019m an internet stranger and I\u2019m super mad for you. NTA.", "NTA! High five! She fucked around and found out! You haven\u2019t done anything to apologize for!", "ESH  \n\n\nShe was mean and not funny, your response was over the top and childish. All of you need to grow up and try harder if you really want to work it out and have a better family dynamic.", "NTA", "NTA what the hell is wrong with your parents? You should not have had to say anything as your parents should have defended you and then they have the gall to ask you to apologise???? \nYour Dad is saying he\u2019s on your side but if he really was then he would never have passed on your mum\u2019s ridiculous demand. \nUltimately it\u2019s always the same root cause, your parents simply do not have your back. \nYou really need to think about if this is a relationship worth saving.", "NTA She was rude for zero reason. She didn\u2019t like hearing her overly promiscuous truth in front of her family. She should do better all around. Your uncle can kiss off for his low blow \u201cthin ice\u201d remark.", "[removed]", "NTA. Your mother wants you to keep the peace yet didn't tell her niece that she was being an idiot. Since your whole family knows the situation, then either they don't believe it was really your brother, or figure no one cares enough to stand up for you. The whole lot of them have a ton to make up for, but it looks more like they're expecting you to fall in line with sweeping things under the rug so they can still use you as the butt of jokes and whatnot.", "Nta, but why does a 54 year old need to show his ID for a drink?", "Apparently the world is full of people who think that other people who are wronged 1.) ought not to respond with justifiable anger and 1.) ought to apologize to \"keep the peace.\"\n\nYour mom is one of these people  Let her apologize when she's wronged, but not impose this craziness on you.\n\nYou were wronged.  You responded with justified anger.  So far your aunt has apologized sincerely, your uncle has barely apologized, and the bad actor, your cousin, hasn't apologized.\n\nYou owe now one an apology.
