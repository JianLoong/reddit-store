I work night shift so I get home from work in the morning. \n\nI called my mom early yesterday morning after work to wish her a happy birthday. We had a pleasant conversation. My wife and kid were just waking up and eating breakfast.\n\nMy family decided to celebrate mom by having a birthday dinner at my parent\u2019s house who live close by. They were ordering lots of delicious, expensive food. \n\nUnfortunately, I was scheduled  to work at night so I wouldn\u2019t be able to join the dinner. My mom was a sad, but understood.\n\nI put my mom on speaker so my wife and kid could wish her a happy birthday. They exchanged pleasantries and birthday wishes.\n\nBefore taking my mom off speaker, I had the idea that my wife and kid should go to the dinner even though I couldn\u2019t.\n\nMy mom liked the idea and so did my kid. My wife said it would be weird without me, but my mom told her she would like her to come just to relax, get some relief from watching the kid and to eat. My wife then agreed, but by her voice, I knew she wasn\u2019t happy about it. \n\nAfter we hung up I asked my wife if she was okay and she said she was fine so I played along but I knew I was already in trouble.\n\nMy wife is an introvert. She hardly talks to anyone. She hangs out with no one besides our kid and I. She\u2019s an extreme homebody and loves taking things slow at home. She doesn\u2019t even speak or visit her own family even when they ask her to.\n\nWhen I\u2019m around she goes out with me and socializes fine with others. She even seems to enjoy it. But if I\u2019m not there she doesn\u2019t like to socialize with people.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for 15 years, married for 10. She says she likes my family and loves my mom.\n\nMy mom is not the critical type of mother in law. She just wanted to see her grandkid and share her meal with them. I thought it was a nice idea.\n\nI understand that my wife has social anxiety and is not comfortable doing social things without me, but she knows my family very well and says she likes them. She had no other plans that day and was probably going to veg around the house.\n\nI know I kind of led her to do something uncomfortable but I think sometimes you just need to do uncomfortable things to grow.\n\nMy wife knows my family is kind, non threatening and giving. They showered her with food and desserts to take home afterwards. In photos they all looked happy, especially my mom and our kid. \n\nI want my kid to be able to enjoy time with my family too, even if I can\u2019t be there. I don\u2019t want my kid to be isolated. We\u2019ve been together for 15 years. Family shouldn\u2019t be treated like strangers if they don\u2019t deserve it.\n\nI feel a bit frustrated and a little bad, but I want to know if I\u2019m an a-hole for pushing her to do things like this.", "created_utc": 1704736009, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191r11x/aita_for_making_my_wife_go_to_my_moms_birthday/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You MADE your wife go to the diner party, knowing she doesn't like socializing with her own family let alone with yours.\n\nIf you feel like you made someone do something, you are the AH.", "Soft YTA because I don\u2019t think had bad intent \n\nNext time - ask your wife FIRST before you volunteer her for something you know is going to make her uncomfortable - even if it is with your family.  \n\nYou took her choice to go or not away from her and put her in a position where she felt obligated to agree.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if your wife is an introvert or extrovert, or if your mom and your wife have a good relationship, or if she had a good time at the event. You don\u2019t volunteer someone else, or put then in a spot where it is hard for them to refuse. You are taking away their choice and it feels like shit. You should have brought the idea to your wife after the call and let her decide and then follow up with your mom. You probably could have convinced her. But the issue is you backed her into a corner, and no one likes to feel like they are forced into a situation. My friend did something similar to me once, and immediately after the call realized she shouldn\u2019t have done that and apologized. You need to recognize that what you did was wrong, apologize, and don\u2019t do it again.", "YTA - you set your wife up for this knowing it\u2019s not something she would want to do.  Just because she likes your family doesn\u2019t mean she should be coerced into spending time with them when she doesn\u2019t want to.", "YTA. You put your wife on the spot, and, alongside your mother, pressured her into going when you knew fine well she didn't want to.", "NTA.  Your wife could have said no and didn\u2019t.", "Yep, YTA. Nothing like putting your wife on the spot and in a very awkward position, especially knowing she has social anxiety! That inconsiderate, disrespectful and selfish. You owe your wife an apology!!", "NTA\n\nYour wife should work on her anxiety. She is an adult and you asked her. Also, she can\u2019t expect to raise a child inside four walls. I don\u2019t understand what her issue is, yes she is introvert but she is an adult and she should start to behave like one now when there is a child.", "Ofc the cat ladies come out of the woodwork and spam YTA, women cant do no wrong at all and just visiting her in laws for one dinner is anathema. Honestly men should stop marrying, cheaper to get an escort and maid on weekly basis than get married to one of you harpies", "YTA - you should have gotten off the phone with your mom and asked your wife privately if she would go.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s wasn\u2019t your decision to make for her. You put her in an uncomfortable position on speakerphone.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to decide on other people\u2019s plans for them. \n\nIt\u2019s bizarre that you don\u2019t think what you\u2019ve done it wrong. Truly bizarre. YTA\n\nEdit; and to boot your mother is an alcoholic, which something that is  always uncomfortable to be around, especially at parties.", "YTA, the idea that you think you need to force your wife to \u201cgrow\u201d is pretty paternalistic and controlling. Maybe she\u2019s happy being an introvert? Maybe she likes your family but still prefers to not hang out if you\u2019re not around? You just pushed her into it knowing she wouldn\u2019t want to go instead of being supportive and giving her the option or even trying to convince her for your kids sake.", "YTA . You did this while your mom was on the phone Ofcourse she\u2019s gonna say yes. You should have gotten off the phone and asked her. I would be upset also. You can\u2019t force her to get out of her comfort zone leave her alone", "Yta. If you know exactly what your wife is like and what she enjoys, why would you volunteer for her to be in a situation she'd hate.", "NTA. You wife is an adult and like you said, she should be able to take your child to places when you aren't there. She shouldn't have to rely on you for every social interaction. \n\nYes this was likely awkward for her and you could have asked her not on speaker phone. However, she needs to understand that her anxiety shouldn't hinder your child's time with family.", "Yta-what on earth are you thinking?? Do you go to social engagements with your wife's family without her? \"I want my child to enjoy my family too\" Then TAKE HER. Its not your wifes responsibility to maintain a relationship with YOUR family; it is yours. \"My wife isnt social\" So you think volunteering her for something you already know she will hate...is the best thing to do?? \nWhy are women expected to have and maintain a codial/friendly relationship with inlaws immediately upon getting married, but the expectation for men is almost nonexistent? YTA hard-core I hope your wife throws you into the middle of something you hate so she can \"feel bad\" about pushing you too", "YTA a little . You should have talked with your wife after the call. Even if you pushed her in private to go that would have been better than putting her on the spot.", "Soft YTA\n\nI really don't think you thought through that your wife wouldn't really be able to say No if you had her on speakerphone. She would've felt put on the spot.\n\nIt's really for  her to decide when & how far she challenges herself re her comfort zone not for you.\n\nYou should discuss anything like this/that she may find difficult with her first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Social anxiety is far more complex than competing plans and comfort with people - as you said, you\u2019re her safety person. She can be successfully social around you and through you.

In fact you should start the convo yourself and ask her if she\u2019s okay with your efforts now and in the future.", "Absolutely YTA\nThat was not your decision to make.", "NTA.  You didn't make your wife do anything.  She has a voice, is an adult, and can say no. If she isn't able to tolerate disappointing people, she needs to work on that.  You asked her, she said yes.", "YTA. You\u2019re very condescending to your wife. \u201cSometimes you need to do uncomfortable things to grow\u201d? I call BS. You aren\u2019t actually interested in creating an environment for your wife where she will feel safe and supported to grow. You haven\u2019t even asked her if she\u2019s *interested* in growing. You just decided she should and that you would throw her into it in a situation where you knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to say no. \n\nIf you\u2019re actually concerned about your kid spending time with your family there are lots of other ways to solve that problem. It sounds like you\u2019re mostly just annoyed with your wife. Don\u2019t pretend like you\u2019re making her uncomfortable for her own benefit.", "This, THIS, THIS!!!!  OP, YTA!!!  by deciding THIS was the opportunity for your wife to \u201cgrow\u201d and backing her in a corner, you just showed how little you respect her comfort and autonomy, and are now trying to justify it in a \u201cFather knows best\u201d rationale you\u2019ve crafted to ease your conscience.\n\nPersonal growth happens on one\u2019s own terms, and if she pulled this shit on you in an equally uncomfortable kind of situation in your personal or professional life, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d see how fucked up this was.\n\nYOU DON\u2019T GET to decide \u201cwhat\u2019s best\u201d for another autonomous adult.  Period.  And you don\u2019t get to decide what\u2019s best for your kid without consultation and concurrence with their other parent.\n\nI hope she lets you have it.  If you had an issue with her introversion, \u201chome bodiness\u201d or need for personal growth, those are private conversations for you to have with one another, not for you to force uncomfortable situations upon her.  You really couldn\u2019t be much more of an AH for thinking this was remotely okay.  I get maybe it seemed harmless and like a good idea at the time, but you KNEW how uncomfortable she would be and pushed ahead anyway.  \n\nYour mother neither asked her directly to come, nor did she volunteer on her own behalf.  You justifying placing her in this position under the guise of making her grow and doing good things for your family is so condescending and patronizing.  If you don\u2019t fix this kind of mindset I hope she dumps you and that your son and his future partners are just as introverted as she, and keep you at an arms length for all their days.", "Exactly, NTA. And the mother needs to do some parenting as well.", "If his wife \u201cneeds\u201d to go out and socialize. She can do that with her own friends and family.", "No.... the wife is free to respond however she wants. Why do you feel you can speak for what she should or should not have done?", "Thank you for this. I welcome the criticism and want a healthy perspective, but it\u2019s a bit tough going down. I believe I\u2019m a kind and patient husband. Before we met, my wife was severely depressed and together we got her through it. It took a lot of tender but sometimes tough love. That\u2019s what I thought I was showing here, but I guess it was too aggressive to put her in that circumstance. I just knew if I didn\u2019t make it a little difficult for her, her immediate answer would be to say no and they would have stayed home and missed out.", "I agree with all of your points here. I'm also an extreme introvert with mild social anxiety and this is the type of thing where if I knew a few days ahead of time so I could pick out an outfit and birthday present (and maybe get my hair or nails done) I'd feel better about it, like I'd done all the socially expected bits and was prepared. Being put on the spot on a speaker call for something the same day is the type of thing I have nightmares about.", "I\u2019m impressed that you actually went that far. Yes my mom is a recovered alcoholic, but she one of the best people I know. There is a lot of prejudice against those with alcohol misuse disorder. Some people can\u2019t seem to see the person behind the disease. My wife always saw the good in my mom and cheered her now. This was a reason why this birthday was so important to celebrate. You are a stranger trying to piece together fragments desperately reaching for a reaction so I hope you are satisfied with this one.", "You do realize her mother in law is family and is the child's grandmother. When you enter a marriage you make a pact. When you have a kid part of that becomes shared responsibility for the child. That means that when the family has an even and one parent can't make it, the other parent needs to step up. \n\nI also like how all the people advocating for the wife neglect to see that only having your husband and child as a social outlet is terrible.", "Because she's not the only one this affects. She's denying her own child time with their family because she doesn't want something. When you're in a relationship and have kids your opinion stops being the only one that matters.\n\nI do shit for my wife all the time I don't want to do and she does the same. That's what being in a relationship is like.\n\nWhat would happen if god forbid OP drops dead? Is his child never supposed to see his family again because his wife doesn't like to socialize?", "A couple dozen YTA roll in, and you single out the one (ridiculous) opinion that favours you. Seems about right.", "It is also very telling that the *only* comment that you  responded to is the ONLY one that is saying you are not the asshole.. You clearly are not on here for any objective advice. You were just looking for somebody to agree with you....", "A kind and patient husband would not force or basically guilt trip his spouse Into going somewhere she doesn't feel comfortable going. \n\n\nIf you do not want your child to miss out, you had several options. You could have taken time off work, or made arrangements in advance for someone to bring him to the  event.", "As soon as your kid was excited she should have just sucked it up and went. Her isolation is directly affecting the child. \n\nMy wife was fairly similar, everything would cause anxiety and stress. Couldn't go anywhere myself or with her without it being some sort of issue. Thankfully that's not really the case anymore but my fuck was it brutal and we don't even have kids.", "The MIL is OP\u2019s relative. It is fine for people to choose not to have independent relationships with their partner\u2019s relatives.", "The family is free to go pick up the childs if they want the child's presence at their dinner.... What's the husband does not entitle to do is make plans for his wife, especially without consulting her...", "She is not denying anything. OP is free to maintain the relationship between his child and his relatives. He could have planned a special BD lunch for his mommy on his next day off. This is 100% not his wife\u2019s responsibility.", "Completely ignoring the main point.", "Orrrrr crazy thought... She puts on her big girl pants and goes so her child can spend some time with their grandmother on her bday. \n\nIt sounds like her only plans are never leaving the house.", "Well, apparently this MIL enjoys driving drunk.", "When you marry into a family they become your relatives as well. I like how you say \"mommy\" as an insult to him trying to defend a grown women with a child from visiting her in-laws and having dinner because she's scared of a conversation.\n\nGrow up", "Orrrr crazy thought... Her husband does not try to change her from the person that she was when he decided to get into a relationship with her.... If she was good enough for him to marry then why is he trying to change her now?", "Once again. Shes not the only one she's affecting. \n\nShe also said it would be \"weird\" without her husband. How the fuck is it weird to spend time with a family you've married into for 10 years and have known for 15? Is she expected to go there and provide entertainment? No, she's going, sitting down, eating some food and going home. \n\nIf that's enough for her to be weirded out I really would hate to see how she would react to an actual dilemma."]}
