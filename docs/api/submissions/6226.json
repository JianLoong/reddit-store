We were married 12 years, have 6 children together. I filed for divorce after he told me he was going on a \"walk\" one night, 3am comes around and he's nowhere to be found so I go looking for him. Drive around and look in his work parking lot for the hell of it and lo and behold, he's in his 18 year old coworkers car. Found out he was having an affair. That was the end of that. \n\nAnyway, when we first split up, he legitimately had a mental breakdown and went through a period where he was very mentally unstable and ended up quitting his job. Friend of the court office wanted to go after him for child support, but since he was unemployed they only ordered him to pay the minimum amount ($360 a month for 6 kids). Keep in mind, I have full custody of all of my kids and he only recently started taking 2 of them at a time each weekend to stay with him Friday to Sundays. He also went a long time without paying me a dime until they finally started garnishing his checks.\n\nFast forward to today, we are on good terms and coparent pretty well. He's now doing much better than he was, has a full time IT job where he just got promoted and makes $24 an hour full time. He has a gf with kids and they just recently moved into a place, where he literally only pays $300 a month to live there (her father bought it and that's all he asks him to pay, apparently). His gf also has a good job so he's not hurting for money. \n\nMe, on the other hand, have been working part time, only make $15 an hour and have struggled this whole time trying to support my kids without very much help at all from the ex. I have just recently got promoted and will be getting about $2000 a month (less after taxes and my car payment get taken out), was also offered a house that's part of my job, will be living on site and it gets taken out of my salary. \n\nSo I recently decided to file a motion to get child support payments increased. According to my states child support calculator he should be paying just under $1700 a month. I filed the motion asking for $1500. Put the court papers in the mail yesterday so he should be getting them any day. I know when he sees them he's probably going to flip out and get mad at me. \n\nAm I wrong for doing this? Is that asking too much? Part of me feels bad for filing the motion but at the same time I'm just about fed up with struggling to survive with all of our kids while he takes 2 out of 6 kids each weekend, only pays $360 a month and doesn't do anything else to contribute.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most cases where im from its normal after a few years to revisit the visitation and child support payments because situations change. Kids cost money and more than housing and food. Whether he is with you or moved on he still has the obligation to help financially support his children. Just because you've managed to all this time doesnt mean you have to continue to do so. Now thats hes better he can step up more.", "NTA. Offer him to voluntarily increase the money. If he doesn\u2019t, backdate the request and go for the maximum.", "NTA,\n\nGet the payments. If you don't need it then put it away for your children.", "NTA Those calculators take into account each person's finances and what the kids require. In my state there's no negotiating. You should get the full 1,700.", "Nta, he is the AH for thinking $60 per month for a child is enough.", "NTA. You need help. Right now he\u2019s only paying $60 per child. As soon as he got a better job he should have voluntarily increased the child support. Because he didn\u2019t do that, you need to go through the courts to get the help you need.", "NTA.", "I'm not sure why you think there's anything wrong with asking him to support his children. You'd be TA if you deprived your children by not doing it. NTA", "NTA Go get what you and the kids are owed, honey", "I get the background story. Irrelevant for me in this case, maybe it was done for sympathy. Either way going for cs modification is pretty standard. If he is paying 360 a month for 6 kids odds r when you divorced he wasn't making much and now his income has changed sounds like substantially. Will you get the \"worksheet 1700\" probably not as those tend to be a joke anyway but it should increase. Now how much depends on your state. Are the kids on his insurance? That will dwindle that 1700 down as insurance is high for family and yes that's taken into account and deducted from weekly obligation in many states.\n\nDoes your state factor in parenting time? That may also be a deduction. Will he claim you are under employed? Yes, that's a thing and increases your percentage of weekly obligation even if you are not making that much. It's the argument of you purposely low balling in order to avoid. \n\nPlus you yourself just got a raise so those percentages may adjust somewhat maybe not even in your favor.\n\nDefinitely NTA here as it's just part of the process. What he pays in rent is moot for the court. It's about gross weekly income and any deductions that come from it but you are allowed to petition for modification just as he is. At 360 month he would be insane to do that.", "You probably just torched that \"good relationship\" of yours.", "And not even taking all the kids at once. OP never ever gets a break from being a parent. Meanwhile he gets to choose when and how to be parent. And he's now taking on more kids when he's not even fully supporting the ones that he helped make.\n\n\nNTA OP", "And not even taking all the kids at once.

I am not surprised an 18 year old caught his eye.

In most states that's a legal requirement. Dude had the kids and has to take care of them. If the relationship suffers for him having to own his responsibility than that's on him.", "I'm not that interested to be honest.  As A\\_F says it would be a 'nice gesture'.  But it is always best to get these things airtight.", "I think NTA even if she didn't ask beforehand. Sure it would have been nice to give the heads up, but given the history we've been given it makes complete sense this would go through the courts", "For me, the dude should obviously be paying his fair share of child support, no doubt. But if you have a good relationship with the dude and drop legal papers on him without saying a word, that's definitely assholish behaviour.", "Also true!"]}
