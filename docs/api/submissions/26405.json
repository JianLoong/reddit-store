We live overseas and recently were invited to dinner at the home of an American colleague and his Asian wife who is the same ethnicity as my husband. There were others there of the same ethnicity so it was a themed home cooked Asian meal. We had a great time and had some excellent food. Fast forward several weeks and I am out of town on work travel for a few weeks and my husband tells me that one of the single women at the dinner and the wife of another colleague felt bad for him because he doesn\u2019t get home cooked Asian food and offered to come over and cook him a meal while I am away. I told him if it was over at the husband and wife\u2019s apartment, that would be fine, but I really don\u2019t want two women I don\u2019t know rummaging around in our kitchen while I am away. What I didn\u2019t say is that I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for my husband to have two women over while I am out of town cooking a meal in our kitchen. If the situation were reversed and it was two men coming over while he was out of town, I don\u2019t know how he would feel. We trust each other and have never had any reason to doubt our fidelity but I just don\u2019t think it is an appropriate ask. I spoke with my husband today and I sense a disappointment since he loves his Asian food and am wondering AITA for telling him I would rather these women not cook at our place?", "created_utc": 1694115986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cobod/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_would_rather_he/", "score": 670, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It feels like a bid to get your husband and the single woman together by putting her in your home, because it\u2019s a silly arrangement. You might not have ingredients, tools, spices etc that would be necessary for this. Why not just bring him a home cooked meal in containers? I would not be comfortable either.", "NTA. Fidelity reasons aside - it\u2019s weird. I wouldn\u2019t want ANYONE I don\u2019t know well coming into my space while I\u2019m absent and touching / using my things. And like you\u2019re saying, if the genders were reversed it would be seen as weird AF. It would rub me the wrong way if this was being perceived as fine for some reason, due to outdated stereotypes that women need to wait on men hand and foot and this assumption that your husband isn\u2019t capable of fending for himself in your absence. If these women feel that strongly about babying your husband while you\u2019re away, they can cook at their house and drop it off for him.", "I agree it\u2019s inappropriate. They could also easily just cook him food and drop it off if they were so concerned. They don\u2019t need to physically cook it in your kitchen and then hang around. Also why would you not invite the husband too if they are all planning eating together. It sounds very suspicious.", "Invite them to cook while you are there. If they say no, that's your answer about their intentions.", "NTA \n\nHell no. If they truly felt sorry for him, they could cook it at their own respective homes and drop it off. \n\nBut to use your kitchen while you\u2019re away is very invasive and intimate. And to only offer while you\u2019re away seems sus.", "NTA, this feels weird and like an attemt at a setup.\nAnd even without tve implications I still actually wouldn't want a stranger to use my kitchen, that just gives me the ick", "NTA this is so strange!  Why are these women acting like your grown husband is an infant incapable of feeding himself?  It's not even about trust, it's about 2 women you don't know rifling through your cabinets and treating your husband like he's a neglected child.", "NTA. you aren't telling him he can't eat their food, you are saying you don't want two random women in your home while you're gone cooking with your stuff in your kitchen for your husband. they could cook it and give it to him, they could have another dinner at the colleagues house. they do not need to come to your house when his wife isn't there to cook for him.\n\ni guarantee your husband would probably not be thrilled about two rando men cooking for and doting on you when he's not home.", "I get a feeling that they are playing matchmaking woth singel woman and your husband. I get the love for his home countries food. Especially asian since feels so elaborate to make from scratch, atleast to me (hand down for every person make and do cook asian autentic meals).\n\nI think you NTA. He should not be okey with this either as its his job to make sure his side of the relationship is closed from intruders, just your dide is your job.", "NTA\n\nI am a woman, and I have seen this sort of thing, these women are trying to get your hubby interested in the single woman.  He may be trustworthy, but women are not.  They can cook and drop off a meal if they need to help, not go cook in your kitchen or spend any time at your home without you also there.  If they were that concerned, they could come and show you how to make some of the things.  This is not good.", "NTA.   I agree with everyone... this is weird \ud83d\ude10", "And how would they know that she was out of town?", "NTA it is a little weird.", "Why can't your husband just cook his own Asian food? How odd. NTA", "What the incompetent husband is this?! He cant feed himself? Spare me - he is LOVING the ego boost & is getting a kick from your discomfort no doubt. \n\nMaybe you SHOULD have some men around next he\u2019s out of town to help you out. Or even if he isnt. Just odd jobs here and there. So he can comprehend what you\u2019re saying. Empathy isnt enough, he has to EXPERIENCE it to understand. \n\nWhat a child for even entertaining the idea of someone else coming in and cooking for him while you\u2019re away. NTA.", "NTA. For me this would be hard hell no. \n\nFirst of all I don\u2019t want strangers in my kitchen. I like my kitchen a certain way and I don\u2019t randoms in my space. You don\u2019t know how clean they are and again they are strangers.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t the married woman\u2019s husband included in these dinner plans? Why isn\u2019t the married woman cooking at her house and just inviting your husband over? \n\nIf your husband misses Asian cooking so much why doesn\u2019t get his butt into his own kitchen and cook his own food?\n\nI don\u2019t think this is a question of trust. IMO this is a question of RESPECT and I think it\u2019s disrespectful for two woman to want to come over to your house when you are not there to cook for your husband.", "So instead of inviting you and your husband to a meal, they decide to invade your home and kitchen while you're gone?\n\nNTA, that's so weird and inappropriate", "NTA - Ignore any of the implications of your husband having two lady guest over while you are away. \n\n\nI personally wouldn't want any randomer in my home, especailly my kitchen, using and potentially abusing my utensils, cookware ect. \n\n\nThere's also a lot of disrespect in the \"sympathy\" they're giving OP's husband. Implying that OP is not adequate.", "Cone over and cook him dinner?  No way would  I be okay with that.\nWHy can't they invite him to their houses to have dinner with their families?", "NTA. I\u2019ve been married 27 years and find this odd. Why wouldn\u2019t the married couple have hosted?", "NTA\n\nBecause I wouldn't want someone in my kitchen either. \n\nBut I think it would be weird regardless of the gender of the potential cooks. If you wouldn't be bothered by a male friend of his doing the same and you trust your husband, it shouldn't matter.", "NTA  \ud83d\udea9 when did this conversation between these women and your husband take place? Are these women texting/calling your husband directly?", "I think you are reasonable. I was once helping a woman learning to drive. She was 20 years older than me and I would have never thought of cheating with her, I told my wife was asked to help her learn and I did one lesson, but my wife told me that even though she trusted me, it could be misunderstood by someone else, and cause me an issue potentially \n\nI got the message and saw her perspective, stopped it.", "NTA. I have zero trust issues in my marriage, and I looked at this from both perspectives as if it were me having men over or him. If they were close, mutual friends that we are both close with maybe I\u2019d feel differently, but overall this just feels like a weird thing to do when you\u2019re not home. If they\u2019d be open to doing so when you\u2019re there and maybe you can learn from them then that would be a great solution.", "NTA.  Something will end up happening.  I don\u2019t even know why a woman would want to be in a woman\u2019s house when she\u2019s not there.", "You know, there are few people who are more trusting in their marriage than my husband and I,  yet there are no circumstances in which I would be comfortable with this. Strangers cooking in my kitchen? No. NTA", "INFO: since you don't cook that ethnicity's food when you ARE home, why did they wait till you were gone? Why not do it while you were there? You and hubby could even be sous chefs for them so you can both learn how to cook it. \n\nUnless maybe it *isn't* about making sure he gets to eat home cooked food of his ethnicity \ud83d\ude2f.", "NTA\n\nThat's not an acceptable thing to offer to him without his wife there, and I don't see how he accepted that.\n\nThat's a big red flag imo. He should know better.", "I don't think the asshole. At least he asked without having done it straight out and you finding out later, so this could have been a lot worse. Sounds like you both handled it properly.", " NTA. If they want to share some home cooked Asian food with him they can cook it in their own house and just drop it off in a container. No need to come and cook in your house. You\u2019re absolutely right is inappropriate, and your husband and these women should know that.\n\nEDIT: On second thought, why are they so worried about feeding your husband? The more I think about it, the more red flags that raises. That\u2019s just weird and so inappropriate. I\u2019m sure there are nice Asian restaurants your husband can order takeout from if he wants while you\u2019re away, or he can just learn himself how to cook them. You can find great recipes online.", "Being an Asian living in another country I can see how the offer came about. I don\u2019t think it was nefarious, I think it was more a bond over their culture. Ive had similar situations where someone had a dish that was hard to get and I wanted to eat it as it makes me homesick. That being said if it makes you uncomfortable, it makes you uncomfortable. NTA.", "Has your husband agreed that it would be inappropriate for either of these women to come to your house to cook  for him whilst you are away?", "NTA. This is completely inappropriate. These are not close friends or family members. If they want to prepare a dish for him, they should do so in their own kitchen and drop it off for him and leave.", "NTA. Togo containers exist where you live, right? If they want to make food and drop it off, that\u2019s really kind of them.", "NTA. Nice for them to invite him over to a group setting while you\u2019re gone. But not appropriate for them to be in your home using your appliances and everything while you\u2019re away. That\u2019s intrusive.", "NTA. That's a really strange situation", "Would you have the same reservations if it was two men coming over to cook? \n\nOr if it was the husband and wife?", "NTA. He\u2019s grown and can feed himself, but they could also just drop off food if they thought he couldn\u2019t cook.", "Tell husband to tell women that he appreciates the offer but perhaps they could simply drop pre cooked food off at either work or a quick exchange at a mid point location", "NTA\n\nIf he's just in it for the food, he can definitely get it elsewhere. Order in, learn to cook himself, etc. \n\nEven if these women weren't trying to worm their way in on your relationship, the situation is still insulting. I mean \"they feel bad for him\"?? Come the fuck on, it's just food. They definitely have suspicious feelings about your mixed race marriage at the very least.", "NTA. That\u2019s just weird. When I was single and talked to or met with a couple, I always focused a little more on the woman out of respect. I never wanted to seem like a threat. No way would go to a married man\u2019s house and cook without the wife there. He can rough it for a few days.", "NTA I think you're right. Why aren't these women inviting him over to dinner with the other husband present? I don't think I'd be comfortable with a single lady coming to cook dinner in my home for my husband either. It's one thing for a male and female to be good friends and to meet for dinner somewhere. It's a whole other ting when they want to  meet alone in one of their homes. I think you've got a woman sniffing around your husband for cooking, but not in the kitchen.", "NTA. If they really felt bad for him, they could drop it off at the door.", "NTA. weird.", "NTA. For so many reasons No. Just no. \nNo. \nNot appropriate or acceptable on any level. \nNo.", "NTA. Why tempt fate?", "NTA. I would bet cashy money that there is only the single woman coming over to \"cook\", and not two women.", "NTA - They can just as easily cook both of you Asian food when you return.", "NTA - this is giving me trespass vibes.\nHe can order a takeaway or go to their houses.", "Nta, that\u2019s inane as a single woman to essentially insult the wife and then come over and cook , nah she\u2019s got definite motives", "Nope, NTA. Weird and inappropriate!", "Do his hands not work??\n\nNTA", "Somebody wants to have intercourse with the husband blatantly and transparently", "This seems like a scheme. These two women have decided that you\u2019re being neglected not having a traditional wife who can cook traditional meals. And look here, what a coincidence, we just happen to have an available option right here. \n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA I kinda feel that the married woman is trying to set op's husband up with the single women friend considering the single friend is Asian and op is not.", "NTA, that so weird of them! I would never think to have another woman come into my home and cook for me while my wife is away??? And like he\u2019s an adult, if I can find a way to cook homemade Asian foods on tiktok your husband sure as hell can!!", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult he can cook his own food.", "NTA. Boundaries will be blurred. What unintentional message will your husband send out if it goes ahead? Have he considered that?", "NTA. If they really were wanting to give him food, they could just bring it over in Tupperware, or invite him over to the married couples house for a friendly meal.", "NTA\n\nI would be super uncomfortable with two strangers rummaging around in my house without me there. They can drop something off if they feel sooooo bad for him", "The fact they say they are worried about him because he doesn't eat Asian food on a regular basis is funny to me, nta", "IMHO, having a married counterpart as liason is the key\n If it were just the single lady, I feel it would be bad, but a married person to help oversee the situation would be better. That said, your comfort zone is the real barrier. If you feel it is inappropriate,  discuss with him and explain. His disappointment may be more the obvious smoke of women in my kitchem....", "If he loves Asian food, he can hire a chef.

She is welcome to come to your home and make food when you\u2019re there also and she can cook for you both. You love her food. \n\nIf your husband sees no problem with it, tell him while you\u2019re overseas, you\u2019ve also hired a personal chef who will cook you Asian food too.  Then go hire an actor who\u2019s attractive and can hold a wok. It doesn\u2019t matter if the food is good or if he\u2019s actually a chef. You can order take out. Then send your husband the actor\u2019s pic and the food your personal chef cooked.", "NTA\n\nThats weird. I could see a neighborly offer to cook you both a portion of whatever dish the next time they cook whatever dish and then drop it off in tupperware containers. But to physically come over and cook? Why?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t care about two women of the same ethnicity were making him dinner, I\u2019d be like go get all the food you want. But I wouldn\u2019t be down for them cooking in my kitchen while I wasn\u2019t there, that just feels like a violation in an odd way.", "NTA\n\nTell him he\u2019s welcome to accept their offer of a meal\u2026 but that they will need to cook it  in their own homes and he will pick it up like a delivery service. \n\nHe isn\u2019t friends with these women so it\u2019s weird. If they were established friends then no biggie. But yeah, I wouldn\u2019t want strangers rummaging around in my kitchen. It doesn\u2019t matter what intentions anyone has - I don\u2019t want a stranger going through my stuff!", "NTA. \n\nWhat's stopping him from learning to cook those dishes and then creating them at home for you both? Seems odd someone would need to do that for him unless there's information I'm missing.", "NTA. He\u2019s playing with fire and I would not like it either. If he does it again, next time he\u2019s gone then have some guys over to cook for you.", "NTA. It's not really that strange an offer, but if it's going to cause a lot of strain on your relationship in the long run I would probably tell him that.", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing inappropriate about this at all. If you trust him, you trust him. Is it possible that you were jealous that these people cook better meals than you do or something that resonates with him better because it\u2019s his ethnicity?", "Would you mind if he went out to dinner with the two of them?\nEdit: I think YTA.", "NTA. I'm uncomfortable for you in this situation", "NTA, this is inappropriate and crosses some major boundaries. By his age, he should be perfectly capable of taking care of his own meals for a few days. If he is not capable of feeding himself, well that speaks volumes and none of it good.", "YTA - \"We trust each other and have never had any reason to doubt our fidelity but I just don\u2019t think it is an appropriate ask.\"\n\n\"If the situation were reversed and it was two men coming over while he was out of town, I don\u2019t know how he would feel.\"\n\nYou don't trust your husband, and you don't think he trusts you.", "For me I wouldnt even be upset thinking about 'cheating'. \n\nIve been a Cook for 15 yrs, NTA\n\nMy kitchen is my space. My place to express myself. My space where I show my love for those in my life and my community. \n\nIt wouldve been vastly, wildly different had they invited husband over to previous friends house for a communal meal. Or like some others have said, even if they'd prepared food and dropped off containers. \n\nBit for 2 woman, one of which is single to feel the need to step into someone elses home, use someone elses kitchen specifically to feed someone elses husband while wife isnt there? Is deliberate. I dont want to assume they're intention is what we're all thinking, but.. \n\nThis feels like its coming from not a well intended place. Especially since your out of town. They couldve invited to make a dinner for the group upon your return. But they did this knowing your gone. Thats red flags.", "Wildly inappropriate. I don\u2019t know how they got the offer out of their mouth without realizing how ridiculous it sounds, like directly out of an episode of Desperate Housewives. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. The couple inviting him over for dinner and inviting another single person is one thing, but it's weird that they have to come over and cook it in your/his kitchen. Why don't they just bring him the prepared food?\n\nI would find it uncomfortable too.", "YTA. Do you think your 56 year old husband will end up having a threesome? No, he's just going to miss out on a nice homecooked meal because of your insecurity.", "As someone who spent years as a \"trailing spouse\" living overseas.... YTA. \n\nFinding a small bubble of people to enjoy hanging out with is everything. The vast majority of other \"trailing spouses \" are women.

Often times it is a thing of respect or generosity.", "This is not cool at all. I hope it didn\u2019t happen. I certainly would not like anyone in my house cooking or not that I didn\u2019t know while I was away.", "NAH.

If anything, he will learn to cook those meals and make some for you. Learn to trust your husband.", "YTA. I'm going to assume that you have no problem with your husband having male friends over and cooking dinner? The issue is only with females.\n\nIf I get that right, the problem is not that you mind anyone 'rummaging' in your kitchen. The problem is that you do not trust your husband. You kinda admit that by saying you wouldn't know how he feels with you having two men over.\n\nThe issue is not these friends or someone being in your kitchen. The issue is your lack of trust.", "NTA. I'll leave aside the whole gendered thing about infidelity, (because I think it's a bit silly that the implications would probably not be there if women were men and thus assumed to be friends), but I think it's pretty reasonable that you don't want people in your house doing something as intimate as cooking for your spouse. There's just something very primal and instinctive about cooking for *your* family something they like in *your* house, so I totally understand that having other people impede on that when you're not there.\n\nIf you trust your husband and there's nothing else hinky about the situation you haven't included here, I think it would be more reasonable if he went to one of their houses for a meal or perhaps you compromise, if it doesn't bother you, and let him have people over, but they have to *bring* food, and shouldn't be using your kitchen to create whole meals for him. Or just make friends with the ladies and have them come over when you're both home.", "NTA, it is definitely a odd request.. Why isn't the colleague's wife just inviting him over for dinner?

We live overseas and recently were invited to dinner at the home of an American colleague and his Asian wife who is the same ethnicity as my husband. There were others there of the same ethnicity so it was a themed home cooked Asian meal. We had a great time and had some excellent food. Fast forward several weeks and I am out of town on work travel for a few weeks and my husband tells me that one of the single women at the dinner and the wife of another colleague felt bad for him because he doesn\u2019t get home cooked Asian food and offered to come over and cook him a meal while I am away. I told him if it was over at the husband and wife\u2019s apartment, that would be fine, but I really don\u2019t want two women I don\u2019t know rummaging around in our kitchen while I am away. What I didn\u2019t say is that I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for my husband to have two women over while I am out of town cooking a meal in our kitchen. If the situation were reversed and it was two men coming over while he was out of town, I don\u2019t know how he would feel. We trust each other and have never had any reason to doubt our fidelity but I just don\u2019t think it is an appropriate ask. I spoke with my husband today and I sense a disappointment since he loves his Asian food and am wondering AITA for telling him I would rather these women not cook at our place?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And the latter could\u2019ve been a great way to make friends.", "NTA and why would they even offer to come into your home without consulting YOU?", "That is a good question. My wife and I consider ourselves to be trusting and frankly incapable of infidelity as well. She would certainly take issue with two strange women cooking supper for me as well for many, many valid reasons.

I know personally get blinded by excitement sometimes. So I personally might not have picked up on it being an issue until it was pointed out to me.\n\nAlso depending on his culture, it might be common to share food with people they care about or want to get to know. it was very much a cultural norm in my childhood, we would give our friends veggies from our veggie patch and they would maybe make a stew and give us a portion.

Like sure he could really probably try and learn and cook Asian food well if that was something that was important to him, but it's also just a nice opportunity sometimes to have home-cooked food made for you by someone of that culture, a bit special too honestly imo.\n\nI'm sure this man is capable of feeding himself, but maybe I'm wrong.

OPs husband is from the same Asian culture as several people in their friend group (including the two women iirc), and his disappointment is related to the lack of home cooked Asian food he has in his diet. He an adult, probably with an internet connection, who was raised with this cuisine. If he asked a friend to show him some dishes and some basics because he\u2019s struggling, like the friend and his wife that hosted the dinner they went to, that would make sense. Instead he seems to be of the mind that if someone else doesn\u2019t cook it, he can\u2019t have the food. He did listen to OP but he\u2019s disappointed and bummed. Why?

I'm a Hispanic woman who knows how to make a few cultural dishes. My culinary skills are nowhere near my mom's or aunts. I can make it myself, but hells, I would rather have my momma's or aunt's versions. It just doesn't taste the same. And of course, it feels more special when someone cooks it for you.\n\nOP is totally NTA, I don't trust these other women. But, I don't blame husband for wanting authentic food from someone more experienced with the way it's done. I doubt he's a full time home cook who constantly practices his home land's dishes."]}
