It's similar to Aspergers but not quite the same. Carl has always been capable of learning and correcting any negative behaviors (i.e. knock before you enter the bathroom, ask before taking something that belongs to someone else, you wouldn't like someone making comments about your weight so don't do it to others.) Me and Sarah would try to teach these skills to Carl. Carl clearly demonstrated that he was capable of learning. But my parents would undo any progress we made by claiming Carl was autistic and therefore incapable of learning or changing, so trying to teach him at all was \"cruel.\" My parents have never brought Carl to any kind of behavior or social therapy. They've held onto the excuse of \"He's autistic and can't change/learn!\" for Carl's entire life. Carl still lives with my parents. My parents are in their sixties and they're exhausted.\n\nMy parents previously pressured Sarah to be Carl's caretaker after they passed away/were unable to. But since Sarah now has children of her own, they've started pressuring me instead. They claimed to be feeling sick and asked if I could pick up groceries and bring them in the house for them. When I got there, my parents clearly weren't sick and said they wanted to talk to me. They tried convincing me to house Carl after they passed away/were unable to take care of him. They said that \"all I had to do\" was let Carl live in my house and keep an eye on him, and that they would set aside money to pay for a personal chef/maid to handle Carl's needs. I told my parents no. I am not housing Carl. There is nothing they can say or do to change my mind. My parents started to lecture me, saying I was being so cruel to Carl because he's autistic and my refusal to look after him will ruin his life.\n\nI told my parents that they are the ones who have ruined Carl's life. They saw Carl was capable of leading a normal life but they coddled him instead. They actively stopped him from learning skills and how to survive on his own. When they pass away and neither Sarah nor I will look after Carl, it will be their own fault. Now several family members (mostly older ones who are too old to look after Carl themselves) are calling me an awful sibling. They accused me of being ableist for refusing to house my autistic brother and become his legal guardian after my parents die. Especially because my parents are desperate and offering to pay for a personal chef/maid for Carl. I don't understand how I'm an ableist for refusing to be Carl's legal guardian because he isn't my responsibility. I know what I told my parents was disrespectful but it was still true and they need to hear it.

I did not realize the damage I was doing to my son, it took my brother to set me straight. It was hard to hear and it was definitely hard to see my son learning and not needing me as much as I thought he did. My advice is to have your parents hire someone who can teach him life lessons so when your parent are no longer here he has the ability to live on his own with someone checking in with him once or twice a week. Autism does not necessarily mean unable to function in society. They just need a little more help.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are the ableist ones by coddling and enabling his regression from learning proper boundaries and behavior", "NTA and this is definitely a case of \u201cI do not think that word means what you think it means.\u201d They\u2019re trying to accuse you of \u201cableism\u201d because they want to guilt trip you into taking on a responsibility they\u2019re not willing to do themselves, and \u201cableism\u201d sounds buzzwordy.

What classes/tutors/programs could he use?\n* find a place he can live as independently as possible while having whatever support he needs, or figure out who your parents could hire to help Carl stay in their home\n* set up a financial trust for his future care\n* make an estate plan that provides for Carl", "NTA\n\nThey enabled him, he\u2019s their problem\u2026not yours.

I am in a similar situation in which i'll be taking my brother when my parents pass. The only person who suffers in this is your brother and its an immature take. The real problem lies in advocating for your brother to get him the help he needs now since your parents wont. He absolutely should've been in therapies years ago like you said but that doesn't mean hes a lost cause. I understand that this shouldn't be your responsibility but again, the only person who will suffer is him. Social Services should have info on adults with disorders and resources to get him help, also establishing a plan now so that he could possibly be in a residential facility or some other group home so that he will be safe and cared for is so important. You and your sister are literally all he has and its not his fault he is like this.", "ESH. This really shouldn't be a matter of who is at fault here, but more - how to solve the current problem of your brother's future. There are other solutions to look into that don't require your brother moving in with you. Getting angry at your parents and telling them they ruined your brother's life isn't productive. \n\n\\-If he has a diagnosis, look into getting him on disability - he may be eligible for different government programs.\n\n\\-There are housing situations for autistic people that provide a degree of support - like communal meals, etc. You could all look into these, how much they cost, etc.\n\n\\-You could research options for what behavior/social therapy there are nearby, you could make an appointment for your brother. Your parents aren't dead yet - there is still time for Carl to work towards being more independent. \n\n\\-Figure out how much your parents will actually be able to leave Carl- do they really have enough money to pay for him to have a private chef the rest of his life?", "ESH\n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to house your brother -it's not your responsibility. So your parent's are wrong for trying to pressure you\n\nBUT\n\nJust because an autistic person might have been able to learn social cues etc, does not mean they are necessarily capable of ever living alone or supporting themself. Autism is a spectrum. Someone's communication skills might be good - but they might have poor executive functioning (this would make it hard for someone to be capable of maintaining a job, paying bills, etc).
