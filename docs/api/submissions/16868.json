The presentation was 15 minutes minimum with a 15-minute question session afterwards.\n\nThere\u2019s one guy in my course (John-21m) who many people in the course dislike. He\u2019s the epitome of an \u2018well acktuhally\u2019 guy who likes to be the devil\u2019s advocate for things that shouldn\u2019t have a devil\u2019s advocate. He\u2019s embarrassed himself more than once by asking ridiculous and pointless questions to our professors that have no relevance and he\u2019s very full of himself. I\u2019m aware that this all may seem harsh, but this has been consistent behaviour for the past 2 years and his smarminess has isolated himself from many people in our course who don't want to deal with him.\n\nAfter our presentation, he says he has \u2018several questions\u2019 and proceeds to ask some of the most irrelevant questions. For example, in the presentation, I mentioned that one of my inspirations for the project was a trend in 2020 where grown men (usually 30-40-year-olds) would duet teenage girl\u2019s (13-17) tiktoks mocking them; from how they liked their coffee to their prom dresses. John\u2019s question was \u2018don\u2019t you think they should get criticism for posting online?\u2019. Not only was this not relevant to the project, but you could sense the tension in the room. So many people rolled their eyes and even his friend gave him a 'shut up' nudge.\n\nAfter a few more questions which were all directed at me, not the other 3 people in the group, I admittedly got annoyed and said \u2018listen, mate. I\u2019m not going to answer any more questions from you. You\u2019re clearly trying to grasp at straws here\u2019.\n\nThe rest of the questions from our other peers were great and actually of substance. And overall, I feel the whole thing went well other than that one hiccup.\n\nAs we were leaving the hall, I hear John complaining to some of his friends and then I saw him going to talk to our lecturer.\n\nI got an email from our professor asking me to join a TEAMs meeting where I was expected to apologise for \u2018embarrassing\u2019 John and something about how we were supposed to create a \u2018safe space\u2019 for our fellow peers and by being rude I didn\u2019t do that. He said if we can sort it out before Thursday (tomorrow) by ourselves, then great so I sent John a quick message saying I didn't mean to be short with him but he was clearly asking pointless questions. He just replied 'you didn't have to be a bitch about it' and then blocked me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683705789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13djy5d/aita_for_embarrassing_a_guy_in_my_lecture_by/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or \" that's an interesting question but discussion on that would take up more time than we have here\". You get the idea. He's a pain, but there is one in every group.

You have a Q and A session for your project so you answer all and any questions (in a learning environment there is no bad or pointless questions) - that\u2019s also not for you to decide. If the teacher says, \u201cThis is getting off topic,\u201d then that would be one thing, but if not, then just answer questions as they come.

Let the teacher know you tried to bury the hatchet and move on.", "Esh.  I get it; it\u2019s incredibly frustrating to deal with such a person.  That being said, as the person/group giving the presentation, there is an onus to be professional.  I would have said something like,\u201dthank you for your question but due to time constraints, we will not be fielding inquiries that are outside of the scope of relevancy for our project.\u201d Then anytime he asked such a question in the future, you could reply,\u201dThank you for the question; that is outside the scope of our project. Next?\u201d This person isn\u2019t the only one who exists like that in the world.", "I'd say you're NTA. If this is truly a daily occurrence with John then I can understand yours and everyone else's frustration, HOWEVER, how you responded during the end of the presentation towards him could've been handled better. I feel like you both should apologize to one another, not just you. Also if this has been going on for 2 years (from what I understand) your professor is just doing their job as much as I'm sure they're tired of his shenanigans too. Maybe John has some personal issues as to why he's the way he is. Either way, kindness is free and if that doesn't work, ignoring is always best.", "NTA but you have to learn to deal with idiots like this in your professional life, smile and nod and answer his questions and let him embarass himself. \n\nThe teaching staff likely take your side and know how annoying he is but have to follow through with all the protocols they've set in place for bullying or whatever so they have to take his accusation seriously so they don't get sued or disciplined or whatever. Go to the farcical meeting and suck it up and \"apologise\" to him sweetly and without sarcasm, he'll love it and enjoy it and it will suck but sadly you just gotta kiss ass and bend over sometimes, especially in the world of work, so practice doing it now.", "NTA\n\nI suspect John has a cognitive/spectrum/learning thing going on and throughout his schooling has had his parents say he has a cognitive/spectrum/learning thing going on and needs additional support.\n\nJohn needs to get over it.

But until then, there's a reasonable process, which your professor is following. Assume the professor is acting in good faith, and let that process have a chance to work.\n\n(NB: I'm not 'both sidesing' here. I fully agree that this other student is a complete dickwad. But give the professor a chance to tell him to stop being a dickwad before going to admin.)", "Explain to the admin that these two men have gotten together to bully you for standing up for yourself.
