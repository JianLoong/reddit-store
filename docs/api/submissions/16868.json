Going over his head and claiming that this is sexist bullying would not be a good look.\n\nIf, *after* the meeting, you feel that the professor is still not taking your or your concerns seriously, *then* go to the administration and say that you feel like you are not being respected. But until then, there's a reasonable process, which your professor is following. Assume the professor is acting in good faith, and let that process have a chance to work.\n\n(NB: I'm not 'both sidesing' here. I fully agree that this other student is a complete dickwad.

There's no winning with them - they're usually narcissists who are just trying to show off and/or tear others down.

And it's always okay for you to choose not to answer a question, especially if it makes you uncomfortable or is wasting time where you could be having an actual real discussion based on other legitimate questions.\n\nThe professor should have shut it down in my opinion (I'm a professor, but I'm also a woman so maybe I'm more attuned to this kind of toxic dude dynamic). They have a responsibility to the students to maintain that safe space and keep control of their classroom, facilitate good discussion, etc. \n\nI agree with what others said to screenshot the conversation you had with him after as proof that you tried to apologize and he called you a misogynistic slur in response. Show that to your professor and explain that you don't feel comfortable meeting with the student via Teams anymore. You could also explain that you certainly don't feel that you should have to apologize for embarrassing him when he was clearly just trying to undermine you.\n\nI see some people getting up in arms here about the gender dynamic, but this is absolutely a gendered thing.

Tell him you understand that it's not usually productive to call people out publicly, but that you felt it was necessary in this case, and that it resulted in you receiving better and more engaging questions from other students, so your actions had their desired effect. Then loop back around to John calling you a bitch, which is FAR worse and more rude than anything you did, and which clearly illustrates that John is a bad faith actor who has zero interest in mediation. Tell him you think it's abundantly clear that you are on the right side of this, and if he doesn't see this, then you will need to speak to the administration about why the professor is siding with a student who called you a bitch when you tried to reach out in good faith.\n\nI agree strongly with the post below about not immediately going to the administration. This will only serve to make an enemy of the professor, he's going to get super defensive and double down, almost certainly. Personally, I think it's fair to do what I said above, and suggest you will go to the administration if he keeps siding with John. But feel free to leave that out if you think that will be too confrontational.", "I'm not sure where exactly you are, but if you're in the US, you should bring up Title IX. You should say that John's questions felt relentless and targeted to you specifically as a woman.

If either dude becomes aggressive, say that you think the meeting isn't productive and end it, then go to the administration with the questions written out, with John's text message, and the notes of the meeting.\n\nThe Johns of this world need to learn early that it's not 1970 anymore, and they need to treat you with respect.\n\nETA: realize I assumed you were in the US re:Title IX.

Also you should talk to the dean or someone else to whom your instructor reports because he is not handling this student appropriately AT ALL.

John had an opportunity to ask three questions which had all been answered by OP.

Parent comment also made shit up. \n\nI would further disagree with the proposition, as women calling out men is actually quite acceptable socially, at least in the south.
