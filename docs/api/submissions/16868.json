The presentation was 15 minutes minimum with a 15-minute question session afterwards.\n\nThere\u2019s one guy in my course (John-21m) who many people in the course dislike. He\u2019s the epitome of an \u2018well acktuhally\u2019 guy who likes to be the devil\u2019s advocate for things that shouldn\u2019t have a devil\u2019s advocate. He\u2019s embarrassed himself more than once by asking ridiculous and pointless questions to our professors that have no relevance and he\u2019s very full of himself. I\u2019m aware that this all may seem harsh, but this has been consistent behaviour for the past 2 years and his smarminess has isolated himself from many people in our course who don't want to deal with him.\n\nAfter our presentation, he says he has \u2018several questions\u2019 and proceeds to ask some of the most irrelevant questions. For example, in the presentation, I mentioned that one of my inspirations for the project was a trend in 2020 where grown men (usually 30-40-year-olds) would duet teenage girl\u2019s (13-17) tiktoks mocking them; from how they liked their coffee to their prom dresses. John\u2019s question was \u2018don\u2019t you think they should get criticism for posting online?\u2019. Not only was this not relevant to the project, but you could sense the tension in the room. So many people rolled their eyes and even his friend gave him a 'shut up' nudge.\n\nAfter a few more questions which were all directed at me, not the other 3 people in the group, I admittedly got annoyed and said \u2018listen, mate. I\u2019m not going to answer any more questions from you. You\u2019re clearly trying to grasp at straws here\u2019.\n\nThe rest of the questions from our other peers were great and actually of substance. And overall, I feel the whole thing went well other than that one hiccup.\n\nAs we were leaving the hall, I hear John complaining to some of his friends and then I saw him going to talk to our lecturer.\n\nI got an email from our professor asking me to join a TEAMs meeting where I was expected to apologise for \u2018embarrassing\u2019 John and something about how we were supposed to create a \u2018safe space\u2019 for our fellow peers and by being rude I didn\u2019t do that. He said if we can sort it out before Thursday (tomorrow) by ourselves, then great so I sent John a quick message saying I didn't mean to be short with him but he was clearly asking pointless questions. He just replied 'you didn't have to be a bitch about it' and then blocked me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the late edit I just got back from work. There were 3 guys and 1 girl (me) in the group and the professor is a guy also.\n\nTo everyone asking why I didn't handle this 'professionally': This is the first time I've done something like this and I was already nervous because of the grade/assignment aspect and I get major stage anxiety.

But until then, there's a reasonable process, which your professor is following. Assume the professor is acting in good faith, and let that process have a chance to work.\n\n(NB: I'm not 'both sidesing' here. I fully agree that this other student is a complete dickwad.

There's no winning with them - they're usually narcissists who are just trying to show off and/or tear others down.

And it's always okay for you to choose not to answer a question, especially if it makes you uncomfortable or is wasting time where you could be having an actual real discussion based on other legitimate questions.\n\nThe professor should have shut it down in my opinion (I'm a professor, but I'm also a woman so maybe I'm more attuned to this kind of toxic dude dynamic). They have a responsibility to the students to maintain that safe space and keep control of their classroom, facilitate good discussion, etc. \n\nI agree with what others said to screenshot the conversation you had with him after as proof that you tried to apologize and he called you a misogynistic slur in response. Show that to your professor and explain that you don't feel comfortable meeting with the student via Teams anymore. You could also explain that you certainly don't feel that you should have to apologize for embarrassing him when he was clearly just trying to undermine you.\n\nI see some people getting up in arms here about the gender dynamic, but this is absolutely a gendered thing.

Those are really similar to the phrases we came up with. Turns out most of the groups also strategized. Near the end of the presentations, one group simply went with \u201cany questions? Except from [annoying guy]\u201d which got a laugh from the teacher because he gets it. The highlight was a group that used a trivia game at the end, and then asked for questions, and he actually said \u201cI had a question, but I\u2019ve forgotten it\u201d and one of the group members quickly said they were done before he could think of it. \n\nThe funny thing is that our teachers are also clearly annoyed by him. One straight up ignores him until it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not giving up, then he sighs before calling on him. Another makes jokes about him going too in depth on some of the subject material that we don\u2019t need to know, and to stop making it hard on the rest of us. There\u2019s always one\u2026", "I'm surprised this isn't further up in the thread.

Whenever I hear a one-sided story where one person is labeled as 'completely wrong,' I find that the more I encourage them to share their perspective, the more I start to realise that there may be more to the story, and the other person may not be entirely at fault.", "I absolutely have flaws and I'm sure John has some good traits, too but over the 2 years we've been in uni, he's shown a consistent pattern of behaviour where he tries to (and sometimes succeeds) embarrass our fellow coursemates by laughing during their presentations, asking silly or inappropriate questions or trying to argue about set-in-stone facts with our professors.", "Calling OP names is how John makes a safe space for John", "It's an insult and absolutely degrading, but bitch absolutely is not a slur.", "/s means their comment was sarcastic", "Yta. In a professional world, which college is supposed to prepare you for, people will sometimes ask stupid, pointless, annoying questions.

Everyone is entitled to an opinion but nobody is entitled to force others to listen to it or engage with it.", "Also, if you have a trusted mentor who is hip to gender issues, ask them to attend also. Give your professor a heads up you're doing so, but they can't say no.", "To be honest, though, OP's other group members - three males - should've also stepped in to help out or help deflect John. Especially as John's questions were pointedly AT OP and not relevant to the presentation. \n\nSo it sounds like all the men involved - John, teacher, other group members - all ganged up on OP or failed to redirect when issues arose where OP was being targeted.", "As a post college woman, the easiest thing for you to do is probably to just move on unless he keeps at it. Most admin aren't going to do shit either unless you want to turn it into a whole thing and try to emphasize that you felt like his comments were sexist and targeted at you (which they probably were). I do fully support you and think you won't be wrong if you do this, but it's going to be a lot of effort and I personally don't think it's worth your time and energy to focus on that AH.", "That is irrelevant.\nOp was a presenter and it was QA time.\n\nPeople like John are annoying but in a work scenario, OP would likely end up reprimanded.", "Agreed. In addition to this suggestion, can you have an extra person (such as a trustworthy classmate or another professor you get along with) also be present for this meeting? I feel like it\u2019s important to have someone present who will not only back you, but also serve as an eyewitness in case something goes wrong. Also, make sure that the meeting is recorded and that you get a copy of that recording immediately. \n\nNTA, OP. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this behavior.", "THIS! OP states that John was told to stop asking non-relevant questions yet he still did so. At some point John needs consequences and those need to come from the teacher. The fact John FINALLY received a shut down consequence from OP means the teacher isn't doing his job (OP has stated the teacher is a male).", "He isn\u2019t mediating though.

OP, in addition, you ought to read up on your school\u2019s procedures for these types of meetings, and if you\u2019re able to bring someone, bring another female professor or staff member (or even just another professor) in your department who has been a witness for John\u2019s behavior in the past and/or sees the misogyny in this event. Having somebody on your side who understands the system and politics of the situation is invaluable.", "[deleted]", "I did include the most important part though; the question that he asked. \n\nAnd yes, reading comprehension. I mention that he asked other questions and gave context to his behaviour. What more do you need? If you can't extrapolate that he's being inappropriate from what I said, then you have bad reading comprehension.", "Starting to think it is.", "NTA. And I would\u2019ve screenshot his email back to you immediately and showed it to his superiors.", "NTA\n\nOh please. A safe space doesn\u2019t mean someone is free from embarrassment as a result of their own questions. If he\u2019s embarrassed because you shut down his pointless line of questioning to open the floor for others, that\u2019s not making a space unsafe.

It also buys you time to put together your response and get it (the dumb question and the person wasting time, as well as your effort and \"team\" playing) in writing. Hope that helps!", "\"Let's take this offline\" is a popular one in my field (said by men and women). If it's really important to them, they can put it in an email and you can discuss it later.", "He was there.\nNot sure he needs either \"side\" of the story.", "Seriously. The kid needed to be called out and OP handled it pretty well for a 20 year old college kid. I would have cried or lost my shit if that\u2019d happened to me back then.

If that were my class I\u2019d be telling John to sit down for harassing a female presenter and monopolising time with poorly formed questions designed to antagonise rather than genuinely generate discussion.", "This sounds like sexual harassment, especially with him calling you a 'bitch' later. Does your university have procedures for reporting harassment? Report him. How is your professor not aware of the issues around this guy? NTA.", "Dunno if you\u2019ll read this, but I totally understand your position. I also had a similar experience where the only girl (me) was in charge of a group of guys for physics. This one guy just did poorly on his work, submitted his section of work riddled with errors, but claims he was so smart (multiple times over the years). I asked him if he could do his work earlier and was called a bunch of sexist things and said i was too emotional. \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt was pretty hurtful at that time, and I hope you are not feeling too bad or negative about yourself. I do not think you did anything wrong AT ALL. I would make sure, no matter what John will throw at you, I want you to calmly state everything and try to act as rational as possible so more potential \u201cfuel\u201d for John won\u2019t be given. Also record, record whatever happens just in case it escalates into something bad. And def clarify what they\u2019re saying for your recording. Repeat what they said in your words and if you\u2019re understanding this properly. Your prof may not be your friend in this scenario. \n\nUm other than that, I told that guy at the end of the year after we finished our lab work to never contact me again. I do not wish for any further interaction (he was also my ex before this whole misogynistic streak was displayed). I got this in writing too, so if i needed to get a restraining order, I could. Maybe you could WRITE to John due to our past interactions, I would prefer you not to talk to me because i feel unsafe with you.

He was belittling you, holding you hostage with his stupid bullshit.", "NTA. oh bestie please take this to DEI. from the questions he was asking to the way they were all posed to you, it's very clear where he's coming from *cough misogyny cough*. demand an apology from him for targeting you in a way that left you absolutely no choice but to call him out. and please keep calling out such behavior, especially in academia where it's so often brushed under the rug of \"professionalism\".", "ESH\n\nYes he\u2019s asking irrelevant questions but there will be many times in professional-setting meetings where you will be asked stupid, pointless, and sometimes ignorant questions. You have to learn how to keep your cool under pressure.

Most of the time these \u201cwell actually\u201d people are just super insecure and if you show them a little kindness and respect they act like normal human beings. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to like anyone in this world and there\u2019s no rule that you must be friends with everyone.

Good luck!", "ESH.\n\nYou clearly dislike the guy and I can't help but wonder how much of that is leaking into your description of him.\n\nThat said, even if you thought his questions were dumb, there were much better ways to end his questioning.
