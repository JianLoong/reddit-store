Going over his head and claiming that this is sexist bullying would not be a good look.\n\nIf, *after* the meeting, you feel that the professor is still not taking your or your concerns seriously, *then* go to the administration and say that you feel like you are not being respected. But until then, there's a reasonable process, which your professor is following. Assume the professor is acting in good faith, and let that process have a chance to work.\n\n(NB: I'm not 'both sidesing' here. I fully agree that this other student is a complete dickwad.

There's no winning with them - they're usually narcissists who are just trying to show off and/or tear others down.

And it's always okay for you to choose not to answer a question, especially if it makes you uncomfortable or is wasting time where you could be having an actual real discussion based on other legitimate questions.\n\nThe professor should have shut it down in my opinion (I'm a professor, but I'm also a woman so maybe I'm more attuned to this kind of toxic dude dynamic). They have a responsibility to the students to maintain that safe space and keep control of their classroom, facilitate good discussion, etc. \n\nI agree with what others said to screenshot the conversation you had with him after as proof that you tried to apologize and he called you a misogynistic slur in response. Show that to your professor and explain that you don't feel comfortable meeting with the student via Teams anymore. You could also explain that you certainly don't feel that you should have to apologize for embarrassing him when he was clearly just trying to undermine you.\n\nI see some people getting up in arms here about the gender dynamic, but this is absolutely a gendered thing.

His big man feefees got hurt by a woman who constructively dismissed him, tattled to teacher about his poor feefees, and now she shouldn't escalate? Please, get the fuck out of here with your loose logic.", "Shit take", "You\u2019re just making shit up, but go off.", "This is good advice. Escalation only works if it is appropriate and proportionate.", "It would probably work better if she stuck to teh truth.", "I agree, although sometimes the path of least resistance is the better way to go. OP was not the asshole to anyone other than (arguably) herself, as now she has to deal with John\u2019s shit, and with however far he intends to escalate the issue. Had she simply cited time constraints as a reason not to answer his bullshit questions, he would have far less of a leg to stand on in terms of a formal complaint. As a woman, I prefer to avoid angering blokes like this for fear of them being complete psychos (because let\u2019s be real, we\u2019ve all met a nutty guy who massively overreacts and tries making our lives really hard or gets dangerous as a result)", "You are pretending that sexism doesn't exist and that her class fellow wasn't misogynistic on purpose.", "> Why not? As a male, I have to be polite with peers of any gender, why shouldn't women?\n\nI think that because practically, males are not polite and evasive with both genders. Men get assertive or insulting or passive aggressive with other males (or women). This happens both when those males are perfectly in their right and when it is all just struggle for dominance.\n\nIt is not that women are never rude, the lady in your story is plain unnecessary rude, so I would not defended her much. I kinda feel like it is situation in which I would be inclined to blame her. But at least she explained her reasoning.", "I think you really should reread parent comment, because that is exactly what they referred to.", "You\u2019re a man. Lol. \n\nBut this is true. They are bullying her. She was bullied by his misogynistic questions. She was bullied into a meeting. Then called a b*tch to boot.", "And so are you, evidently.  So?\n\nHow were the actual questions misogynistic?  Be specific.\n\nProf handled things exactly the way he is supposed to - informed her of a complaint, left it to them to work it out.  That's how grown-ups do shit.", ">How were the actual questions misogynistic?  Be specific.\n\nThe theme of our project was, ironically, female rage and inequality. These were John's 3 questions: \n\n'What's the relevance of the topic?'\n\n'Your investment in this project is silly. I don't understand why this means so much for you.'\n\n'Don't you think the teens who post on tiktok deserve criticism?'", "Yeah he\u2019s a misogynistic prick, I would just let your lecturer know that he called you a bitch and that you will not be speaking to him now, or at any other time in the future; and that you will not be going to the Teams thing either.", "I didn\u2019t even need the question run down. I could see it a mile away. Lol. Whatever you do be sure to document, document, document.", "Those questions are incredibly rude and disrespectful, especially the second one! And the fact that he was directing his questions toward the only woman in the group is very telling as well.\n\nNTA, and you should stand your ground in not apologizing to this AH.", "Yea he is a misogynist and a complete AH. Those questions are not constructive, not seeking information, they are confrontational and argumentative. The third one especially is not really a question but a put down.\n\nAlso he called you a bitch when you reached out. Screen grab strait to prof with administration copied in.", "Furthermore op should quote the same complaint the professor presented with her actions towards John. Now John has made this meeting an unsafe space by using insulting language towards her when her apology didn't come across to him as he felt it should.\n\nI really hope if the professor doesn't respond to John's language to the op during this meeting with the same response he had to the complaint about not answering stupid questions in a presentation that she escalates this to the administration."]}
