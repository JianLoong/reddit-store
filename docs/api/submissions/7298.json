It's a pretty minor thing.\n\nI (31f) recently got a job offer after ages of searching, post-graduation. I'm broke from running through my savings while job hunting, so my mom offered to buy me some business casual clothes for my Christmas gift. \n\nShe also offered to go with me to give me second opinions, since I've never worked a job that required me to wear business casual. I gladly took her up on this, but her time was limited, so we had about two hours together to find what we could.\n\nI found a bunch of clothes that I liked in the first store we went in. The store was pretty busy because of the sales. I went into the dressing room and tried everything on as quick as I could so we'd have time to keep looking if need be.\n\nI folded everything that I tried on (maybe 4 pairs of slacks and a few shirts that were \"no\"s) and stacked them neatly on the chair in the dressing room. There were still empty dressing rooms available for others to use. As I was walking out of the dressing room, an employee stopped me and asked if there were still clothes in my changing room. I said yes there were. She said, you need to put them on the rack (pointing to the clothing rack next to her). \n\nI always hang things up if I have time, and I never leave clothes scattered all over the ground, but I had thought it would be okay to leave them folded like that. I asked her for confirmation, so you want me to go hang everything back up and put them on this rack? She folded her arms and said yes, you need to do that.  I havent shopped at a physical mall in so long that I genuinely dont know if this is the norm and if I'd insulted her by leaving the clothes for her to clean up, so I went and started doing it. \n\nMy mom can be kind of, ah, forceful. She walked over and pushed me by the shoulder towards the dressing room exit and said, OP you don't need to do that, we don't have time. \n\nI felt awkward walking past the woman after she'd just told me to hang up the clothes, but we really were short on time, so I went with it and apologized as we walked out. My mom wanted to keep browsing other parts of the same store quickly, and the employee walked by us multiple times glaring daggers at me. I finally said I'd like to look in another store, because I felt uncomfortable \n\nI realized that I don't know what the  protocol is there. They were busy that day, albeit not in the dressing room. It might have been really rude of me to leave things sitting there like that. But at the same time, I didn't really see the woman doing anything besides following us.\n\nWas she ta, or were my mom and I? I'll keep this judgement in mind for future trips because I genuinely don't want to treat anyone badly.

I think what to do with the clothes is different from store to store (some have bins, some a rack, some you give directly to the employees\u2026), but leaving them in the dressing room, especially after the employee told you what to do with is is kinda bad. In this store, the employees obviously don\u2019t expect to have to clean up after every client, so the next one is just gonna enter a dressing room with random chlothes in it. And honestly, it doesn\u2019t take that much time to put chlothes on a rack. And if you kept shopping, then you did have the time to take 10 seconds and hang up clothes. Next time, stand up to your mom and do what\u2019s right.", "YTA\n\nOf course you are TA! When you try on clothes you are NEVER supposed to leave them in the dressing room. And of course you should put them back on the hangers they were originally on. This is just how you should act in polite society. It\u2019s been this way for decades. It doesn\u2019t matter how trashed you used to leave dressing rooms when you were a teen. You are 31 and should know better now.", "YTA. At bare minimum you put the clothes back on the hangers and hand them back to a staff memeber/hang them on the railing provided.", "Yep, after trying them on, you hang the clothes you don't want on the rack.

If you take it off the hanger, you put it back on the hanger.", "Yta", "YTA, but for a different reason than most of the others. Different stores have different rules/ habits. Next time, just ask before trying on outfits. \n\nIn this instance, a store employee straight up told you what needed to be done, and you and your mother straight up ignored her. This is the equivalent of a front end manager telling you that you have to many items for the express lane, and your mom pushing you through with your 70 items through the 12 or less line,  \"it doesn't matter, OP, we're in a hurry, so we'll just use the express lane anyway. \"", "YTA.

Really?", "YTA folding them and putting them on the chair in the dressing room is JUST as bad as leaving them in a crumpled pile on the floor. \n\nthe employees still have to go in behind you and hang everything up and put it on the rack to then be sorted and put back on the floor. \n\nthe procedure is: grab things you want to try on, go to fitting room, try on things, hang them back up, take what you want to the register and hang the stuff you don\u2019t want up on the rack RIGHT NEXT TO THE FITTING ROOM EXIT on your way out", "YTA but lightly. As a previous retail worker I can say it honestly wouldn't matter for speed of you hung the items or not. Stores are really picky about their displays and there are proper ways to hang things so she probably would have at least had to rehang the pants. You wasted time in the change room folding everything. Next time you go shopping just rehang as you go and use the multiple hooks as your piles.\n\nNo I'm fairly confident if this person was admit that you bring all the clothes out that this is a loss prevention thing. She people will say everything is in the change room and put stuff in their bag. You might have got her in trouble.\n\nAlso it takes like a minute to throw things on hangers, probably less time than your mom took browsing. Alternatively your mom could gone to the till to pay while you hung the stuff up. The fact that your mom continued to  browse even though you were running low on time is the bigger AH move of all.\n\nEdit I just noticed you say she didn't do much but follow you around. Yes that is 100% because she thought you guys where stealing.", "When I worked retail it was my job to keep the dressing rooms clean. I literally got paid to do that. No part of my job was about policing customers. Peoplr try on clothes and the employee gets paid to put them back. If they had a sign up, sure. And it is rude to leave it on the floor. I put them on hangers on the rack bc I worked in retail but it is absolutely expected by corporate that the employees are responsible for that. I also brought people more clothes and offered to put the clothes back as they were done. This was per corporate instruction. At no time was I told to police customers on hanging up and putting clothes back.", "YTA because that's the way the store is run. I've been to other stores where you leave the clothes with the staff and they return them.", "INFO: how much time was really saved by folding and stacking the clothes vs putting them back on the hanger they came with?", "YTA it's not other peoples job to hang your cloths back up that's why they have the racks outside the dressing room.", "YTA \nYou did know the protocol, because she told you.

But now you know better, so you can do better.", "ESH\n\nIsn't it obvious you're supposed to take the clothes back out to the rack at the entry to the change rooms? Employees are tryng to keep track of who goes in and out with what, to prevent shoplifting, and bringing the clothes out is also just courteous to staff and the ndxt customer, who would prefer an empty changeroom without your discarded clothes in it.\n\nThat said, it's enough to bring the clothes back if you're short on time, and employees can re-hang them and return them to  their sections. That's part of the job and they shouldn't be trying to guilt trip you for not dong it.", "It depends on the store. I always ask before I head into the dressing room.", "Former retail work here, your post gave me PTSD lol. Overall YTA but you don't have a nasty attitude so no hate. Your mom on the other hand, I would have wished for her to lose her slippers for sure. \n\nI will say one thing, the protocol/etiquette is GENERALLY to put everything back together as much as you can (hang what came in hangers, fold what's folded, but at the very least not give it back inside out and crumpled), but I've been to stores with different protocols. Some DO tell you to leave them in the dressing room, but usually you can tell by the setup or ask.\n\nFitting room duty was literally the worst post they could assign you at my store and what you did was one of the main reasons why. In my country it was worse though because they made us count the clothing pieces, had a max of 6, we had to physically check for the anti-theft plastic thingy on each piece BEFORE and AFTER they tried them on, ask them to swipe their purse in front of the detector, then VERY FAST fold/hang the clothes back in the racks for a coworker to take back into the store. You also had to periodically check each stall for removed sensors or nasty surprises. The terror of finding crumpled piles of clothes in a stall after a costumer left and waiting to see if it was a mess of inside-out clothes, their own clothes left behind after swapping for stolen, used pads, or lipstick/makeup smeared shirts etc. But having to quickly grab your pile of clothes and get it ready to send back into the store while doing everything else felt so crappy because it felt like the customer could have shown you SOME kindness.\n\nI literally cried when a client and her mom brought out all their 12 pieces of clothing hanging perfect from each hanger lol.", "As a shop assistant, YTA.\n\nAnd if you really are in a hurry at least tell me, instead of leaving like the dressing room was on fire", "NTA!\nMy job...for a while my WHOLE job, involves clearing fitting rooms. \nI generally dislike it when people rehang their clothes. People hang things wrong and I have to re do it anyway. \n\nAll I ask is that you have a reasonable idea of what size you are and not grab a zillion sizes to find out. It isn't that hard. If you choose a size and it's too small, grab a bigger one. A few is fine, a zillion isn't. \n\nEven if somehow you left it a wreck, short of actually defecating on things, that employee shouldn't mean mug you. It's super bad customer service. \n\nLike, firing bad", "NTA. Wtf. I worked in retail for 8 years. We NEVER required people to fold the clothes or hang them up before giving them back. That's literally what the attendant in the fitting room is there to do ( among other things). As long as they're not on the floor, no big deal. Honestly, we would probably have to re hang or refold them anyway after as clothes had to be folded or hung to a specific standard. Kinda baffled that people are saying you're the a-hole. Maybe this is a regional thing", "I\u2019m sorry, OP. I know you truly didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry people are bashing you.

This could involve taking them off the hanger completely and reconfiguring. I used to work at Old Navy. Customers would either destroy the jean wall or attempt to fold them. It was wrong either way and I'd be redoing it all either way. \n\nThey also get paid hourly. You making a mess doesn't cost them. They are paid to pick up clothing messes. \n\nThe employee, no matter whether you left a disaster or not, was in the wrong.

You shouldn\u2019t leave clothes on the floor.  But, you 100% can leave clothes in the fitting room.  It\u2019s the store employee\u2019s job to put them back.  Customers can do this, if they really want to, and can get them looking nice on the rack.  Normally, there are hooks to hang your items on.  Unless there are specific instructions, this is normal.", "YTA. Some higher-end retail shops used to have a dedicated attendant who sorts all the rejected clothes back to the front of the store.

I worked retail in both the men's and women's department of an upscale department store in a mall. It is the employees' responsibility in those departments to check the dressing rooms, return clothing to the rack, and then return that clothing to the floor. It is completely inappropriate for the store employee to have stopped you and told you to pick up that clothing and hang it up. That is literally one of the things she is being paid for.

Like maybe this store has some weird corporate policy, and that would be exhausting for employees to enforce because, from experience, most people do not hang up their clothes. It kind of just seems like they didn't want to do their job. I get it, service jobs suck, but hanging up clothes is part of this one. \n\nI still think ignoring the employees request was rude. It wasnt a totally unreasonable request.

I guess I'm just not clear on whether it's part of the job or if it feels demeaning to some salespeople.

I totally hear you. regardless of what is or isn't in someone's job description, it's about basic decency and consideration. I'm upset with myself that this situation wasn't clear to me, because I've worked in service almost a decade myself, and I try to keep on top of things for the most part. I returned 7 carts left strewn around the target parking lot today because I had time, and people left them blocking parking spots. I specifically said to my boyfriend that people can be \"so lazy and rude\" after I did it. but you know, the shoe kind of fit in this situation too. \n\nI was just raised not hanging clothes on the outside rack, so it didn't occur to me to question it. I always just assumed thats what you do, and the retail workers use the rack for storing the clothes after they hang them. kind of like if I'd never been to a restaurant where youre supposed to bus your own table. I genuinely haven't meant any disrespect all this time, I just didnt know any better.\n\nI'm glad that this lady breaking work-character led to some self awareness. I know it's not the hugest thing, but after a long day in service, a little consideration can be a really good thing. I know from experience.

I was starting to get a migraine, which causes me dizziness and some degree of mental confusion. it's related to a neurological disorder I contracted 4 years ago. in no way does my cognitive disfunction excuse inconsideration or rudeness, but I'm not always at my most aware during those times. so its actually really helpful to be told these things directly, so that I know there's a definite appropriate course of action. my migraines make me out of it, but never to the point where I can't communicate a simple thought to someone. I'll do my best to handle my own mess in the future, and if I'm really unable to do so, I won't just brush past someone with a seemingly thoughtless apology, ill let them know what's going on. \n\nto be honest, and I genuinely don't mean this as an excuse, I was ignored and dismissed so much when I contracted an invisible illness that I stopped using it as a reason and assumed noone would believe me. so I just pretend like I'm okay, sometimes better than others. we really were short on time, but i think a lot of my anxiety came from knowing I had a migraine coming on, in hindsight. I'm starting to realize that reasons aren't excuses, and it's okay to let people know you need help. definitely better than letting someone think you don't respect them or their time.

I very kindly explained that I could only enter one per service, but I'd put in the bigger one now and we could save the other for next time. he screamed at me, physically threw both paper coupons so they bounced off my face, and stormed out without paying for his haircut. and even then I was kind and polite.\n\nI think I'm torn because, I think I'm kind of screwed up in the head by feeling like I need to be this polite as a worker.

There\u2019s no universal law to apply here. \n\nSpecial shout out to the employee for making it an awkward power struggle and to OP\u2019s mom for marching that energy. Bad look for both. \n\nFFR, OP, I\u2019d recommend the general policy of putting the clothes back into the state you found them in: if they were folded, refold them. If they were hanging, rehang them. If there\u2019s a returns rack, take them there. It\u2019s like tipping at a restaurant:\nIf you don\u2019t have time to follow the store\u2019s SOP, you need to spend more and go to a different store, just like if you can\u2019t afford the meal with tip at a pricier restaurant, you need to choose a cheaper restaurant.", "You are not T A. As the recovery lead who was responsible for. store appearance and fitting rooms during the pre-Christmas rush, and after Christmas clearance rush, I can understand why this person was upset, but if the fitting rooms weren\u2019t very full, it was perfectly easy for her to go in and take care of it. However, I don\u2019t think it would have been much more work for you to hang the clothes, than to fold them and set them on the bench. Your mom, I think was T A for the way she treated the store worker and you.", "NTA. I've worked retail and it was part of the job to put the clothes back on the racks. IT'S PART OF THE JOB. I appreciated the  thought when people who would put the clothes back, but as long as they didn't leave everything is a wrinkled heap on the floor, I was good.  Also consider that unless a customer puts their 8 (example) rejected items back on the 8 different racks they came from, they are making more work the the salesperson who has to properly return them to stock.", "Yep, YTA. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t leave them all over the floor, but especially if they were busy, you should have hung them up and taken them out of the room. I worked retail for fifteen years before becoming a teacher and to me, this is akin to people who don\u2019t return their shopping carts to the cart return. That\u2019s basic and such a small thing, but it speaks volumes about a person\u2019s character.", "YTA. \nI've never heard of not returning the clothes to the hangers and to a certain place,  usually a rack on your way out. And the fact that the assistant told you to do it and you refused Even though she made it clear it was expected. You and your mum are in the wrong here.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you are unsure, the best way is to discuss it with the employees manager.", "Meh, I've been told countless times to leave the items I don't want in the cubicle, even with someone there. Even b4 2020, they liked to check after people had been in to make sure no damage or customers item's left behind. Every place is different & some prefer that you don't place on hangers as I've seen some horrendous states that others have left them in so just makes it harder for staff", "It's weird that you got downvoted. In some retail clothing stores, I've been asked NOT to return items to hangers/shelves because the store prefers to take care of it.\n\nI don't understand all the YTAs in this thread.", "Ok I just read your post about your upbringing and I think I was a bit hard on you.  You weren't to know.", "If there was a worker in the fitting room (as it seems she was) they often are posted there to rehang or fold merchandise left. Most of the time they literally say to leave the clothes cause they\u2019ll have to refold or rehang them anyway and it gets the changing room clear faster for the next person.  I\u2019d say you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. The potential AH are your mom ( likely) and the retail worker (maybe). Provided of course that it happened exactly as described.", "You can be a \"good person\" and still br an AH in some situations. They aren't mutually exclusive. My mom is a wonderful person, but I've see her act like an AH plenty of times", "Seriously. \n\nPlastic shirt hangers have hooks that are immovable.  If a customer puts it facing the wrong way, the associate has to pull the hanger out and flip it around. \n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on pants hangers.", "I was going to suggest this too. If one person is trying things on and the other is waiting, we\u2019ll have the waiting person hang up clothes while the person trying things on is changing. So efficient. \n\nAnd writing this makes me realize how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve shopped in a physical store with another person. And now I\u2019m a little sad.", "Agreed! NTA I too worked some retail- just dont leave the room amuck. If you have time, great- but they will most likely be rehung and refolded by the associate handling fitting rooms.", "It's standard to put the clothes back on the hangers in the UK.", "I have nerve damage and bad chronic neck and back pain that when it flares up can leave me bed ridden for days. I don't use that and excuse for being rude.", "You\u2019re not the only one with an invisible disability but most people having issues will leave the mall not continue shopping and ask to leave a store because they feel uncomfortable due to an exchange with an employee. It feels like you\u2019re throwing that out as an excuse for your mistake. When you try on clothes off a hangar you return it to the hangar in the very least.", "I have a brain herniation and intractable migraines.\nIf I am out and a migraine hits I go home.\nI don\u2019t keep shopping.\nI don\u2019t use overhead lights at home or work.\nSo yea I question why you didn\u2019t add it in the initial post and why it was so bad you couldn\u2019t hang up clothes but you could keep shopping in a store that caused pain so bad it brought you to your knees", "YTA. I  cannot believe that a person of 31 years of age doesn't know the etiquette of using changing rooms. Have you ever heard the saying leave a room in the condition in which you wish to find it. That goes for changing rooms as well. If the clothes are on hangers you hang them back up and take them out of the changing room with you. And as a fellow migraine sufferer who is also sensitive to lighting finds you excuses laughable. A sales person is not a servant.", "I\u2019ll eat the downvotes for it, I don\u2019t care.\n\nOP please don\u2019t feel bad, you genuinely didn\u2019t know what to do in this situation and are asking for advice. You were pushed by your authoritative figure to do something that made you question your morals afterwards. \n\nYou know better now, and will do better now. Also, people are really making such a fuss about this\u2026 I\u2019ve never worked a store where people didn\u2019t get confused about how things were supposed to work. The amount of times I\u2019ve had pages torn out of daily menus or other goofy things because the person truly didn\u2019t understand\u2026. Come on now\u2026. And don\u2019t get mad at OP for trying to do her best but her mom is so inconsiderate. OP bothered to come here and figure out what she\u2019s supposed to do. \n\nI\u2019m really glad you are able to see how it\u2019s a problem with the people here and not you.", "Have you had an MRI to check for a chiari malformation?"]}
