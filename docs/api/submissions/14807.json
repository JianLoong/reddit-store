My fiance told me she doesn't want me to go.

I hope you see this red flag.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e is though. It\u2019s pretty damn cold of her to try to stop you from being there for your sister in her time of need. Is she usually this callous?", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 sounds weirdly jealous. It\u2019s very normal for family to be there during a birth ESPECIALLY if baby daddy has walked out.

Having kids (or not) is an emotionally charged issue.\n\nReassure her that you genuinely aren't interested in having children.\n\nAnd remind her that part of being the person who loves and cares for her is that you learned to be like that in a loving and caring family.

These might be relationship ending questions.", "NTA I don\u2019t want children and the thought of being present at a childbirth makes me feel ill but if I was in your shoes nothing would stop me from being there for my sister - even if I had my eyes closed the whole time!

You do need to get to the root of this with her and find out ahead of time of if marrying her means you have to cut contact with your sister or any friends who may have kids", "NTA you are choosing to be there for your sister during a huge milestone that is quite scary and it\u2019s great you\u2019ll be there for her when she needs you. The fact that your fianc\u00e9 thinks it\u2019s weird\u2026. Is weird in and of itself. I was there for my nieces birth, the baby daddy was a deadbeat. My mother and I were her support system when she needed it most.

Fact is, siblings/female relatives attending the birth of a new family member is the way its been/was for pretty much the entire span of human history. When doctors pushed out midwives they also pushed out the female support network to eventually be replaced by the presence of the baby's father. Your parents can't go. Your sister doesn't have friends she is comfortable with enough to have there. Leaving you to fill in the gap. \n\nBy all means have another chat with your fiance about this, because the issue isn't gonna fix itself by the time you come back, but don't budge on this.

I've never forgiven my mom for not coming, she wanted to spoil my older brother as an early birthday thing which was 2 days later.
