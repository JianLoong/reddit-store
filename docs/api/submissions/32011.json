She will never live here. Ever. \n\nGuess what? It took some actual work, making phone calls and using the resources available, but SO and BIL figured it the f out (SIL was on the same page as me)\n\nNTA", "nta at all ur mil has some problems and needs to get her own home", "NTA, but feel free in pulling out every ahole stop needed in making sure she doesn\u2019t move in.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do this.  My FIL moved in and while he\u2019s not a bad person, he\u2019s really a very decent person, we get on okay, it\u2019s still a person in my home I don\u2019t want here.  I would never do it if I didn\u2019t care for him.   You didn\u2019t say how old she is but is some kind of care home possible if you split the coast with the other sibling and her pension?", "NTA. You need to sit down with your husband and strengthen his backbone just a bit so he doesn't cave. Then tell her in no uncertain terms to stop hinting, because it's never going to happen. She needs to make other plans for her future.\n\nIf she has a problem with that ultimatum, I'd seriously think about going no contact. I'd definitely stop the weekly apartment cleaning.", "NTA\n\nTell your husband if he lets her move in, that\u2019s the end of your marriage. Make this your hill to die on.", "NTA- You and your husband better have a talk and set this boundary now. Good that you are thinking ahead honestly.", "NTA but make it clear to your husband that no circumstance shall his mother move in with you.", "Disclaimer: Purely going off of the title\n\nNTA", "NTA. Be firm, don\u2019t give in, and communicate. Tell your MIL you don\u2019t want to make her issues your issues. Tell your husband if your MIL wants to move in that means you and the kids are moving out and taking the house. Your MIL sounds like a rude, negative, and entitled person and she only has herself to blame when it comes to her poor finances and living situation. She made her bed and now she has to lay in it and no one is obligated to help her. If that means she goes to a shelter then so be it. People who refuse to better/help themselves don\u2019t deserve free handouts from friends/family.", "You need to have your husband go and talk to his mother and tell her in no uncertain terms that she will not be living with you all. If she moves in, file for divorce. She will make your lives hell.", "NTA\nI feel if it's made absolutely clear it's not an option to MIL she'll pull herself together \ud83e\udd2a don't let her bully you into housing her. she'll have no other option than to get her shit together if she's facing homelessness.", "NTA it's your job to care for your kids,.not a MIL who won't work", "NTA. Honestly, if I were you and he let her move in, that would be a divorce.", "Your MIL is TAH. Do not let her in your house, ever.", "NTA make it abundantly clear to your husband that the only way he will be living with his mother is if you kick him out.", "I agree that this convo needs to happen, but I think they should have it now, not when there are no real options left. If they plan now, they\u2019ll be better prepared to withstand the guilt trip from MIL later, especially if they sought out outside help in the interim like a third party that will tell her she has not been deemed disabled and her children aren\u2019t actually required to fund her life just because she doesn\u2019t want to go back to work.", "Nope.  Tell him HE is moving out with the MIL while you and the children are staying in the house.", "That would have been my suggestion, too. One of the very few times an ultimatum is the only way to move forward.", "And make MIL aware that is what will happen/she will get turned away if she appears on your doorstep\u2026 it might encourage her to accept a job", "Exactly, talk to your husband to draw the line with MIL now because it's clear you already are her plan B so you need to shut it down ASAP. NTA", "It's not a game of chicken if one side refuses to play. What OP and her husband must do is absolve themselves of any responsibility for MIL. Then MIL can blow her life up if she wants and it will have little to no effect on OPs daily life.", "Ummmm, definitely not.  Doing this is just enabling a toxic person who chooses not to work and expects others to fund their lifestyle.\n\nThe OP sounds like she already helps with things like cleaning... there was the comment about MIL being cranky because they couldn't clean as their mother had just died.  That kinda speaks volumes about the type of person you are dealing with here.\n\nPlus the nasty things she says about her grandchild with the special needs.\n\nMIL can learn to love baked beans on toast for every meal.", "Does she really have to say she loves his mom?", "The only thing worse than having her badmouthing you is having to listen to her BS", "Well said.", "Where does OP say the MIL is \"using illicit drugs\"? There are numerous reasons to not allow this person in the home but I don't see drug use among them.", "The post says nothing about drugs, illicit or otherwise. And at this point, OP has no comments. So why are you just making stuff up?", "Umm. What? There was literally nothing in the post about drug use?", "She can do all that for herself. In fact, unless OP or her husband have power of attorney and she has been declared incompetent to manage her own affairs, she MUST do it for herself. I might condescend to tell her what she could be doing, but in the end, MIL is a grown adult, not a child, and she needs to do this for herself.", "Perhaps find out the numbers for the local women's shelters so that you can hand that to her if she does land on the doorstep.  You could offer to call the first one if you were feeling generous.\n\nSome people are just determined to blow everything up so that someone saves them and essentially get what they want.\n\nI agree that planning ahead is a good idea but you don't actually have to do a lot.  But she needs to know your hard boundary that she's not moving in no matter what.\n\nJust logistically she can't.  There is literally no room.  You could set up a small tent in the backyard and get a portaloo (or just a chemical camping toilet) and you'll set up a shower tent and she can use a bucket of water to wash with.", "They probably mixed it up with the other overbearing mother in law who wanted to force her son to let her live with them"]}
