My husband's brother and wife have no contact with her due to how she has treated my sister in law in the past, and they don't allow her to see their children.\n\n2 years ago my MIL who worked as a janitor in a school, tore her rotator cuff. She subsequently had surgery on it, then proceeded to sue her school district. She lost the lawsuit and was fired. Since then, she hasn't worked, and has complained of a myriad of health issues with her neck, back and shoulder. She's had many MRI's, none of which support evidence of an injury that would impact her ability to work even if there are some limitations. She's lost 3 disability appeals. She has also in this time turned down jobs including working things like receptionist work for a variety of reasons such as too much time on her feet, too much sitting ect... Nothing is 'going to work' as far as her health issues.\n\nMy husband and I purchased a single family home at the start of 2022. We make decent money, but both of us work 2 jobs to be able to more then just make ends meet. We have 2 kids, and we bought this home so we could have enough space for our family. Even so, we had to convert a loft into a bedroom for our younger child.\n\nMIL has hinted all the past 2 years she wants us to let her move in. She and I do not get along, and even the kids are not fond of her. My stepdaughter says she speaks poorly around my husband and myself's young (special needs) son. Recently my mother passed and MIL was annoyed because it meant we couldn't clean her apartment for her.\n\nI'm afraid she's going to be out of money soon and she's going to force her way into our house. My husband doesn't want her here either, but might buckle if she ends up on the street. Once in, I don't think we could get her to leave, especially since she refused to work.
