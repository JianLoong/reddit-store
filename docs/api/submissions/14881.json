Don't feel bad for people who do this understand how the real world works. Money is earned, it's a privilege, not a right.

You have no responsibility for your dad's decisions\n\nSecondly, your dad is NTA because it is his money. He made it clear that the money was for education only and your brother didn't want it.

Yeah, that's entitlement plain and clear.", "Technically the money is your dad\u2019s, so he gets to decide how to use it.

If your dad earned the money and saved the money for education,your brother hasn't the right to use it for a business without your father's consent.

Frankly now is the time for your brother to reconsider going to college; he could even get a business degree.\n\nBut it\u2019s now or never imo; I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ethical to demand parents hold education money in perpetuity because one child hasn\u2019t gone to college, or for one to demand an extra payout because one is going to grad school and they didn\u2019t.", "NTA.  It's a COLLEGE fund.  The criteria is that it's used for higher education.  Your brother chose not to pursue a college degree.

Take the money?", "NTA, your father offered to assist with further education in a program you worked hard to get into. Your brother's anger is misdirected toward you. Your father was clear from the beginning what the criteria is to access that kind of funding. \n\nWhat your brother is doing is emotionally manipulating your family and I would guess this is a common tactic for him. Do not give into him. He does it because it has worked. If he wanted to start a business he would be working full-time, contributing toward the household he lives in, and build a plan to start his 'business'. BTW, the business is him only.

You're not the one upsetting your mom.", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation. My brother pissed away 40k of his college fund that my parents made for him within two years of community college. He promptly failed out after the two years and never returned. I ended up transferring to my dream college which was much more expensive than the money in my fund. My parents gave me the last 20k in my brother\u2019s so that I could get my degree without loans. The money was saved for education and my brother refused to finish his degree, so I got it. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable for the kid actually in uni to get the money saved for uni.
