I don\u2019t believe that everyone needs to go to college, and starting a business might be a great idea.  But if your brother is still living at home and mooching off your parents, I doubt he has the drive to succeed in business.   He doesn\u2019t even work full time, for crying out loud.", "NTA\n\nYour brother sounds really entitled tho. He can be mad all he wants, but  it's your dad's decision and if he hasn't used it at 29....\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, it seems as though your brother was assuming the money was just his to use as he wanted.   He should have discussed his plans with your parents. \n\nYour parents probably also realize your brother,  at 29, has shown no adult responsibility and probably wouldn't make it if he started a business.", "NTA\n\nThis conflict is between your father and your brother. They don't agree on whether the money belongs to your father or your brother. Let them resolve their conflict.\n\nIf the resolution is that the money is your fathers (which seems like the most likely outcome), and he wants to give the money to you, then accept. If that would make your brother upset with \\_you\\_, then your brother is the AH.", "NTa - the only disagreement should be between your deadbeat bro and your Dad.  Even then you Dad's position is completely reasonable.  Living at home for 10+ years likely costs your Dad a fair chunk and with your path that you have chosen, you'll likely be able to live on your own and take care of yourself with your degree.  I doubt your Brother is taking that into consideration on how much money is spent on each child.", "NTA - It's your dad's money and is for college and only college. And judging from what you said about your brother, I'm guessing his business would fail miserably and the money would be wasted anyway.", "NTA\n\nIn the end, this is your father money and his decision. When your brother decided he didn't want to stay in college he lost his right to that money. Your father could use it for himself or put it into their retirement fund. \n\nThe only disturbing thing is that your mother apparently has no vote here? Even if she was SAHM she should have a say in this situation.", "NTA. You did not ask your dad for the money, he offered it to you.

NTA.\n\nBro made a wrong assumption, your dad is the one deciding how to spend the money.", "NTA - It is your dad's money and his decision. \n\nSecure a paid internship and graduate TA position (which equates to free tuition) and give this equal share of money back to your dad. It is then on him to keep or gift to your brother. This shows your brother you are doing your part.", "Just curious - what\u2019s the proposed business?", "NTA, but this sounds like a very similar post.", "Even when there are no AH\u2019s, not every situation is fair or equal. \n\nNAH", "You should do what is needed to get an education. It is not on you if your brother didn't want to study. \nYour brother targeting you with silent treatment is wrong, if he wants to go silent with someone it should be your dad.

Your brother squandered the opportunity for an education, which was the whole point of that savings, based on what I am reading.  \n\nAlso, your brother is 29 and still sponging off your parents?  Yikes.  I am for supporting your children, but there is a point where they have to begin being adults.", "Oh, brother\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour dad made a deal, you chose to honor it, your brother did not, plain and simple. He also sounds extremely entitled. He already barely works with no rent or bills AND wants money to start a business with no degree in business or anything? And how is he going to skip family functions if he lives at the family home? \n\nAnyway, enjoy the money your dad saved for EDUCATION. Don't feel bad for people who do this understand how the real world works. Money is earned, it's a privilege, not a right. Just don't expect a relationship with your brother anymore though tbh, and good riddance", "Nta, just how much money have your parents already dished out for your brother's rent & living expenses already, I imagine that's already a good amount. Do they cover yours too?", "I was legit gonna be one way but context is key and now?\n\nNTA\n\nFirstly, it wasn't you who decided that but your dad. You have no responsibility for your dad's decisions\n\nSecondly, your dad is NTA because it is his money. He made it clear that the money was for education only and your brother didn't want it. Turning around and asking for it to start up a business with a 70% chance to fail in under a decade? Yeah, that's entitlement plain and clear.", "Technically the money is your dad\u2019s, so he gets to decide how to use it.  Go to grad school, get an advanced degree, and set yourself up to do well in life!\n\nNTA and best of luck OP!", "NTA. If your dad earned the money and saved the money for education,your brother hasn't the right to use it for a business without your father's consent. Congratulations on getting to graduate school and hopefully, a bright future. Your mom can be as upset as she wants, your dad saved for education only-your brother did not want one.", "NTA. Your brother needs to grow the fuck up.", "NTA\n\nYour dad set aside money for the college education of his children. Your brother chose not to go to college, and at 29 I wouldn\u2019t expect a parent to hold on to the college fund forever; it\u2019d just become part of regular savings.\n\nYour brother was never going to get that money to fund his business.\n\nYou refusing the money won\u2019t mean it goes to your brother. I also agree that he has recieved significant family support by continuing to live with his parents rent free for a decade; he chose to spend that time only working part time jobs on and off. \n\nYou aren\u2019t taking your brother\u2019s money.\n\nYour parents have money left over in the account earmarked for education. Frankly now is the time for your brother to reconsider going to college; he could even get a business degree.\n\nBut it\u2019s now or never imo; I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ethical to demand parents hold education money in perpetuity because one child hasn\u2019t gone to college, or for one to demand an extra payout because one is going to grad school and they didn\u2019t.", "NTA.  It's a COLLEGE fund.  The criteria is that it's used for higher education.  Your brother chose not to pursue a college degree.  Therefore, he's not entitled to the money and if your parents are willing to give it to you for additional COLLEGE you're certainly NTA and neither are they.  Your brother, on the other hand...", "NTA\n\nSo your brother plan was to repurpose your dad money without telling him? What else did he plan to do without telling your dad? Take the money?", "NTA, your father offered to assist with further education in a program you worked hard to get into. Your brother's anger is misdirected toward you. Your father was clear from the beginning what the criteria is to access that kind of funding. \n\nWhat your brother is doing is emotionally manipulating your family and I would guess this is a common tactic for him. Do not give into him. He does it because it has worked. If he wanted to start a business he would be working full-time, contributing toward the household he lives in, and build a plan to start his 'business'. BTW, the business is him only. Good luck on your program, may you be successful!", "NTA: the brother should have asked before he quit school. You're  father could have just as easily said not to paying grad school.", "your brother shouldn't be mad at you because you didn't decide to use that money, your father did also, he's 29 and still dependent on mom and dad!\n\nNTA, his lack of ambition shouldn't be your problem\n\n>he's threatened to skip all future family functions\n\nlol, like he could, he still depends on dad's money to survive so I don't think he can follow through with his empty threat", "NTA\n\nThat is actually your dad's money, not yours, and not your brother's. And your dad is choosing how he wishes to spend it, not you, and not your brother.\n\nIf your brother had made different life choices, your dad would doubtless have chosen to spend the money differently. But this is on him, not you.", "NTA \n\nThere is an absolute genre of posts where kids think they are entitled to college money to start businesses. Idk if this is a real trend but seriously no", "NTA, and don't feel guilty.  Even if you didn't take it he still wouldn't get the money.  Follow your dreams and accept your dad's help.  You're not the one upsetting your mom.", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation. My brother pissed away 40k of his college fund that my parents made for him within two years of community college. He promptly failed out after the two years and never returned. I ended up transferring to my dream college which was much more expensive than the money in my fund. My parents gave me the last 20k in my brother\u2019s so that I could get my degree without loans. The money was saved for education and my brother refused to finish his degree, so I got it. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable for the kid actually in uni to get the money saved for uni. Your brother is almost 30, if he ever wants to finish his degree, he should have to pay for it because he\u2019s a fully grown adult who lived by the decisions he made", "The working part time jobs on and off definitely caught my eye as well.\n\nI admit, I\u2019m incredibly curious about what this business is, if it relates to any personal interest he has sustained over the years, and what the friend\u2019s background is.", "Also, with food and rent being covered while working how doesn\u2019t the brother have enough money for his new business?", "I want to take a poll on this. \n\nI feel like it would be something like an application for a phone/tablet.", "I think it's a very common situation.", "Except that there is a clear AH in this story.", "Brother lives at home. How is he gonna skip family functions lol?", "Wouldn\u2019t that require some serious education or techno whiz?", "Selling plates of leftovers on fb marketplace.", "Is it? A dad who doesn't want to use the money for college to help the kid that doesn't want to go to college anymore, who wants to start a business with a friend?", "Hilarious \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly. Perfect choice for her brother given his aspirations lol. Probably thought he was Zuckerberg.", "Yes, because a lot of people (and actually entire cultures) put so much into having their kids get a college that this HAPPENS ALOT.\n\nIt happens a lot with weddings too.... parents have the money and will only use it to pay for a wedding... not to send the kid on a European tour or to invest in their crypto mining setup.", "I'm just saying that this was a similar post from one that came out... yesterday? Today? \n\nEither way, I am glad my country has public universities that don't request payment.", "If I had a nickel for every time this happened I would have two nickels.
