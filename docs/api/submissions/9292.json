You're protecting your family. She sounds terrible and if she really wants a relationship with them, she should start by trying to mend her relationship with you. (Even if it isn't possible, she should try.) Instead she's minimizing her behavior and doubling down. Why would you want your kids around that?", "Hmmm I wonder what you might have said in that video that you went to a lawyer to have it deleted.  I get this weird feeling you're not so innocent here and said some things you regret and got upset she showed your husband. Than in fear, got a lawyer to make sure no one else knows.  \n\nYea this all speculative but just a guess", "NTA. Wth?? You're allowed to ban toxicity from your family.", "\"I'm perfectly fine with the status quo. If *you* want to change things, *you* have to demonstrate that it is in *my* interest to allow you into my life. Which I doubt you can do, given that you apparently have no remorse for breaking my trust. Telling me to 'get over it' is proof that you have no remorse, you have learned no lessons, you have nothing stopping you from continuing to do awful things and that I am doing the right thing by keeping my distance.\"\n\nNTA. Even if she genuinely apologized, you *still* wouldn't owe her access to your children. After all, a genuine apology comes without expectations... Anyone genuinely remorseful isn't apologizing because they hope you will give *them* something, they are apologizing because they recognize that they hurt you, they feel bad about it, and they recognize that they do not deserve any favors from you.", "Info:  So you're saying the in 11 years of being with your husband the worst thing that happened with your sister in law is:  we got into an argument and she recorded it and won't delete it (and she never posted it anywhere). \n\nThere need to be more than that for a brother to not talk to his sister", "You were so \"heated\" that she felt the need to record the conversation. Maybe reflect on that. \n\nESH.", "NTA. It's up to your and your husband, and if you both agree on this, then that's the end of that.", "Nope. NTA. You and your husband know what's right for your family and you're acting accordingly.", "Obviously not, why are you even here", "NTA. You should be worried about her recording your kids, which would be a thousand times worse. Keep your kids safe and away from her.", "Nta if she hasn't tried to make amends as an adult with the adults, she will only start doing the same things to the children", "NTA.

Keep it NC. From what you describe, nothing good for your kids will come from a relationship with SIL. Your husband wants nothing to do with her either.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's proven she doesn't respect you or anything you say. If your husband isn't pushing for it, let it go.", "NTA \u2014 sharing dna is not enough of a reason to allow an AH into their lives. It\u2019s not a free pass to do and say whatever you want.", "NTA. You are within your rights to not allow your children near toxic people. Your SIL proved herself to be an untrustworthy AH, and wow, did she ever.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t let her or her mommy near my kids", "NTA. \n\n\nSeems like there are other issues in play here as well though. \n\n\nThey don't seem to have missed anything by not having a toxic relative in their life.  Also considering her own brother is happy with the VLC - let him handle your SIL and MIL attempts at trying to manipulate you with guilt.\n\n\nOur jobs as parents is to keep our kids safe and if safe also consists of keeping certain family members away from them - then that's exactly what you do.", "NTA - sounds like she brings nothing positive to your or your husband\u2019s lives.  She isn\u2019t owed access to your children by birthright.", "NTA.  Keep her out of your life and your children's lives.  Make sure kids don't spend alone time with MIL. She will more than likely scheme to have SIL over when they are with her.", "NTA If your husband isn't interested in a relationship with his sister then you are both on the same page regardless of what was said or done 4 years ago. You do not have to have a relationship with anyone.", "NTA. Family don't get a \"pass\" to be this rude and arrogant. If she wanted so much back to your family life, she should've ask for forgiveness and not demand anything.\nShe tried to set you up, be aware, she'll do it again - with your kids in the mix", "INFO\n\nWhat did you two fight about 4 years ago?", "OP is wise to keep her kids away from the sister-in-law. With her questionable ethics and lack of moral compass, who knows what kind of behaviors and/or ideologies she would impart upon those kids. Move on and forget about her until you run into her at another family function. Hopefully later than sooner", "It\u2019s definitely speculative. We were drinking and drunk woman yelling at her sister in law doesn\u2019t look good on anyone. As far as showing my husband, she wanted to show him \u201cI\u2019m crazy.\u201d None of the content of what I said is \u201ccancellable\u201d just not a good look. The lawyer thing was a scare tactic.", "There is a lot more but for the purposes of this, that is the only thing worth mentioning.", "Reflection has definitely occurred.", "Why would I want a recording out there of me being drunk and yelling at someone? The no contact thing is a long story. She has done and said a lot of shitty stuff.", "I confronted her about the fact that she had moved back from living somewhere else for about 18 months but didn\u2019t tell their special needs brother. A few days prior, I had seen him and mentioned to him that we were seeing her and he was really confused and sad that she didn\u2019t tell him. In hindsight, it definitely wasn\u2019t my place to talk to her about that but she took no responsibility and made a bunch of excuses and I got pissed and brought up all the other shitty stuff she\u2019s done.", "What did you say in the recording? If it\u2019s innocuous enough I assume sharing it anonymously isn\u2019t a big deal? Think I\u2019d need to know to determine if ESH or NTA", "Okay that I can understand thank you for clarifying. And hey I understand in laws can be a lot to handle and somethings they do you just can\u2019t fully explain it your either in awe or just in shock like really?? I have two brother in laws that seem to just blow my mind everyday. Keep your head up and do what\u2019s best for you and your family!", "I'll be completely honest. This isn't a good look for either of you.", "I agree, more info is needed to determine if this is ESH or NTA. It doesn't make sense to me that you hired a lawyer for an innocent, drunk argument.", "The worst thing I remember saying was my husband ex is a whore.", "Fortunately for her, I don\u2019t have a recording of her.", "Hired a lawyer is broad - I paid $200 for them to send a letter."]}
