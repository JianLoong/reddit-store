For one simple reason: you can't host a party while your partner is having a breakdown in the bedroom. She takes priority, and everyone else should understand that. And with a pool in the backyard, you don't want the liability of walking away and trusting that everyone else can act appropriately and not get hurt on your property.\n\nGood for you for having your priorities straight. And stop inviting your family over if they're more interested in their own entertainment than in your wife's well-being. Who needs that toxicity?", "NTA because you said it was not normal for her to cry like that and she\u2019s probably under a lot of strain. The last thing she needed was a house full of people witnessing her have a mental breakdown. I feel bad for her.", "INFO:\nWhat\u2019s your wife\u2019s opinion? Is she appreciating that you canceled the whole event because she was so upset or would she have enjoyed the party later, obviously without your brother. In my opinion it totally depends on her needs in this situation. If she\u2019s so overwhelmed that she can\u2019t attend a party at her own home, relocating to a different place was a good idea. \n\nHow you worded it, it still seems like you overreacted but the main asshole is your brother. Followed by your mom who didn\u2019t support you and your wife.", "\"my mom said I\u2019m a awful host and an embarrassment to my family\" jeeze dude, I'm really sorry you had to endure any of this, but this ALOT. Perhaps if your Mom had raised your brother a little differently, he would know when to keep his mouth shut for his OWN good.\n\nNTA I see you were protecting your wife, and if you had one shot - you made the right decision. I'm sorry this happened to you all.", "INFO: why did you kick everyone out because of one persons comment? Seems a bit of an overreaction and only the brother should have been (rightfully) made to leave", "ESH. You overreacted (I get you were defending her ) over your Brother's \"Joke\" and your Parents couldn't see what an AH comment your Brother made.\n\nYou should have just kicked him out and carried on with the BBQ.", "NTA.  It wasn't just one little comment.  It was rubbing salt into a wound.  It feels humiliating when you have a professional career but you have to take a low paying job for a period of time.  I've been there.   Lots of people have.  But the fact she does that shows her character - willing to do anything to support the both of you until a better thing comes along.  Make sure she knows that.  If I was an employer, I would admire someone who was willing to work even if it wasn't their dream job.\n\nIt's your house, and if your wife is crying in the bedroom - the party is over.", "NTA. You put your wife's mental health over the selfish desires of your guests. If they are mad, they need to blame your AH brother and leave you and your wife alone. Now you know who your true friends and relative are. Treat them to a BBQ and pool party to celebrate when your wife lands her dream job.", "NTA, there was really no way for the party to go on at that point. You needed to be there for your wife and she probably needed space and privacy after that comment if she\u2019s really struggling with her mental health, not 25 people at her house who all just witnessed someone trying to humiliate her", "NTA. While I understand the people saying it was a d!ck move to kick everyone out for your brother's awful behavior, it's your responsibility as her partner to care for the wellbeing of your wife. You can hardly hold a good party without the mood being extremely uneasy and awkward for the guests if one of the hosts is locked in a room sobbing. As for the \"chill, it's just a joke!\" horse plop your brother pulled out, \"its just a joke\" is the last defense of a person who knows they took a flying leap over the line and are now trying to not be held responsible for their own actions. Jokes are funny. Jokes make people laugh. Jokes don't send someone into a crying fit. He was being the ahole and he damn well knew it.", "No judgement, but you essentially allowed your idiot brother to be the most important person in the room. Why allow him to ruin the party?\n\nHaving said that, like some others have said, the party was basically over anyway as your wife was so upset.", "YTA. Your brother was a MASSIVE asshole, but the other 20 people had nothing to do with that and just wanted to have a good time", "YTA. You kicked out 20-25 people based on the poor behavior of one. You could tell your brother to leave and ask your parents to act as hosts while you check on and support your wife.", "[deleted]", "YTA. I don't see why everyone has to pay for your brothers jackassery. you should have kicked him and maybe your parents if they had made too much of a fuss protecting him.  Wild assumption but im going to guess your brother never got his degree.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been valid to ask *your brother* to leave after the comment but you cancelled on a bunch of people who had nothing to do with that. Some of whom passed up other stuff they could be doing to attend your party.\n\nIf I was a guest of yours i wouldn't plan to attend any more events at your house.", "I would have been with you if you just kicked out your brother, but 20ish people, some of whom drove hours to be there?\n\nThat's an AH move.\n\nYou didn't even check on your wife to see if she was alright first, or ask what she wanted to do.\n\nFor those reasons, YTA. For the record, your brother is too.", "YTA\n\nShould have torn your brother a new one and told him to grovel and say sorry to her, if he doesn't or won't, THEN kick him out. Fair enough it might have been a joke to him and he didn't know how much it was affecting her, but no one should ever disrespect someone's wife in their own home.\n\nYou've just punished everyone else to spite your brother", "YTA for punishing everyone when your brother is the one who should have been booted.", "ESH. Your brother is the biggest asshole. You're justified on kicking him out--and anyone who would've backed him up on such a heartless joke--but surely the BBQ wasn't just for your brother and parents. If friends/family drove hours to see you and had to go home early through no fault of their own, that's a bit sucky.\n\nAlso, based off of the post, it seems like you could've texted your wife that you kicked out the assholes and asked if she needed anything or how she wanted to handle the rest of the party. Am I correct in assuming you ended the BBBQ without her input?\n\nIt's lovely that you defended your wife! But I can definitely see why your friends/family are pissed off about the party ending early. That was pretty asshole of you. But, hey, you're married to your wife so she's your first priority. Though, in the future,  don't punish everyone for the mistake of a known asshole.", "Mild YTA. I understand that your wife's unemployment has been stressful for both of you. It is devastating to get that far in the interview process and not get the job.\n\nYour brother is an idiot, but you went a bit overboard. You could have just kicked him out. Or him and your parents if they had a problem with you asking your brother to leave. Throwing everyone out seems to be too much. But somehow I feel that there is more to the story.", "ESH. Your brother was the only one who deserved to be kicked out.", "Holy moly!!! You kicked out 20-25 people over the actions of one? That\u2019s a stupendous amount of power you just gave to your brother. What is missing from the story? What did the others do? Wouldn\u2019t kicking just him out have solved the problem? \n\nYTA", "YTA - You punished everybody for a comment one person made. Your brother is also TA, but only because of how your wife reacted. I personally think it\u2019s a pretty funny joke because people think a degree guarantees a job, which it doesn\u2019t. Overall, It\u2019s a situation that could\u2019ve been fixed by your brother just apologizing to your wife. You all overreacted and now it\u2019s a big thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My point, or from my assumption, the brother\u2019s joke, was to poke fun at people who think a degree is everything. It\u2019s funny because they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. A degree is good enough to get you through the door. It\u2019s your practical, real world knowledge and experience that matters to employers.

It is so hard when you're desperately trying to find a job and it's just not working. I've been there. Out of college, I took a crappy local position related to my degree and it took a year to find a job. When I was in the middle of that, struggling to even get interviews, I was an emotional wreck. I was terrified that I chose the wrong major and I would never get a good job. I feel for your wife and wish her the best and completely understand having a reaction like that.

This might sort itself out as the family that sucks/is cool revealed themselves all in one day", "Imagine you're the newish girlfriend of OP's cousin or something and you go to the party where you don't know people all that well and witness that scene. At 20-25 people, there's a good chance that there are tangental people who don't know the hosts that well. I would be *so glad* not to have to stand there awkwardly with OP's brother being all smug about how he made somebody cry.", "Stupid autocorrect!!!!! That was supposed to be \"upvote\"", "Yep. You\u2019re totally right! I somehow skipped a line when I read it, and thought they meant to invite *everyone* back! My bad!", "Yeah, I misread it. Completely my fault!", "Mine is.", "Yeah, if I was a guest in that situation, I would feel awkward trying to keep up a celebratory atmosphere while one of the hosts is crying their eyes out. I think OP made the right move.", "There\u2019s no party if my \u2018wife\u2019 is having a breakdown in the other room. Brother ruined it for everyone, because he ruined it for me after ruining it for wife. Wife comes first, everyone gets the fuck out. Thank brother.", "I don't think there is any practical issue to the party. I don't think they have to do anything to host other than have the house people turn up to. Someone else could do the BBQ or whatever at that point. \n\nBut if one of the hosts was that upset and the other was rightfully angry about it they have no reason to want people to stay", "Yep. I've hosted parties (not this big, but maybe 20 or so people) when going through some stuff and it's tough enough to do when things go well. I knew that, for me personally, I'd feel better surrounded by loved ones that were supportive. I probably would have noped the hell out of having a party that would be attended by the 'jackass' brother and enabling parents, but she went ahead and did that and ended up being treated like shit for it. I would have lost my mind if my sibling kicked my husband while he was down and I'm not a super sharp tempered person.", "then ur an ah too, pretty simple. Put urself in her shoes, imagine someone just made an incredible insensitive \u201cjoke\u201d to you, making you cry and ur so just kept partying on with your friends? That sounds fun?", "It\u2019s ok, your opinion can be dead wrong.", "You can\u2019t be serious?", "Lmfao it was serious enough for you to say he had a temper tantrum when really he wanted to check in on and take care of his depressed wife \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No lol if I had a family party there are definitely people who would be in attendance that I wouldn\u2019t want seeing me have a breakdown", "Not really. Complete social isolation can oftentimes make depression worse and worsen the household situation even further.", "Would you not feel awkward knowing the man's wife is in her room crying I know I would've", "Sometimes a family rift means you don't have to spend time with people who are going to make you cry and so while it's awkward, it's a win all around.", "[removed]", "Ok cool! I was so confused \ud83d\ude06", "No prob.", "^I ^did, ^too", "If I were a guest and not kicked out, I'd see myself out.", "I would be furious if my partner sent everyone home, especially if I hadn't said to do that.\n\nYou can vote NTA, it's not a requirement here that everyone agrees.", "And you guys can respond with insults and be condescending because someone disagreed", "Of course I'm serious. Throw the brother out, go in and tell your wife you did that and comfort her, rejoin the party with her", "that's...not serious at all...are you okay, man?", "Being a host does have responsibilities, I\u2019d say one of the main ones is not kicking your guests out.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be with them and you should definitely attend your wife but again why offer to host if they\u2019re not in a mental place to be hosting?\n\nKick the brother out and anyone else who wants to agree with his stupid \u201cit\u2019s just a joke\u201d excuse.  Other guests shouldn\u2019t be told to go f**ing home when they were invited over and did nothing wrong", "Yeah any time hosts start arguing or one leaves crying or in anger\u2026 I take that as my cue to GTFO", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

What guest after witnessing that would want to stay???", "we can all have our opinions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Lmfao then why did you need to comment saying it? Or respond to me? You could have just left it :) but you didn't so I responded to your comment because it was an absolutely idiotic take of the events that happened.", "They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, it\u2019s a case of \u201cwrong place wrong time\u201d. Life isn\u2019t about only the person who did something wrong getting punished. Everybody was sent home *because* of what the brother did, not *in addition* to the brother being sent home.", "okay, sorry to, like, really upset you, I'm just using this website for fun. I don't take it seriously like you seem to.", "I think we see things differently and that\u2019s okay. I have certain rules about hosting, I think about my guests and what it means to host events.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to curse at your guests to get out and hence why i voted ESH"]}
