For one simple reason: you can't host a party while your partner is having a breakdown in the bedroom. She takes priority, and everyone else should understand that. And with a pool in the backyard, you don't want the liability of walking away and trusting that everyone else can act appropriately and not get hurt on your property.\n\nGood for you for having your priorities straight. And stop inviting your family over if they're more interested in their own entertainment than in your wife's well-being. Who needs that toxicity?", "NTA because you said it was not normal for her to cry like that and she\u2019s probably under a lot of strain. The last thing she needed was a house full of people witnessing her have a mental breakdown. I feel bad for her.", "INFO:\nWhat\u2019s your wife\u2019s opinion? Is she appreciating that you canceled the whole event because she was so upset or would she have enjoyed the party later, obviously without your brother. In my opinion it totally depends on her needs in this situation. If she\u2019s so overwhelmed that she can\u2019t attend a party at her own home, relocating to a different place was a good idea. \n\nHow you worded it, it still seems like you overreacted but the main asshole is your brother. Followed by your mom who didn\u2019t support you and your wife.", "\"my mom said I\u2019m a awful host and an embarrassment to my family\" jeeze dude, I'm really sorry you had to endure any of this, but this ALOT. Perhaps if your Mom had raised your brother a little differently, he would know when to keep his mouth shut for his OWN good.\n\nNTA I see you were protecting your wife, and if you had one shot - you made the right decision. I'm sorry this happened to you all.", "INFO: why did you kick everyone out because of one persons comment? Seems a bit of an overreaction and only the brother should have been (rightfully) made to leave", "ESH. You overreacted (I get you were defending her ) over your Brother's \"Joke\" and your Parents couldn't see what an AH comment your Brother made.\n\nYou should have just kicked him out and carried on with the BBQ.", "NTA.  It wasn't just one little comment.  It was rubbing salt into a wound.  It feels humiliating when you have a professional career but you have to take a low paying job for a period of time.  I've been there.   Lots of people have.  But the fact she does that shows her character - willing to do anything to support the both of you until a better thing comes along.  Make sure she knows that.  If I was an employer, I would admire someone who was willing to work even if it wasn't their dream job.\n\nIt's your house, and if your wife is crying in the bedroom - the party is over.", "NTA. You put your wife's mental health over the selfish desires of your guests. If they are mad, they need to blame your AH brother and leave you and your wife alone. Now you know who your true friends and relative are. Treat them to a BBQ and pool party to celebrate when your wife lands her dream job.", "NTA, there was really no way for the party to go on at that point. You needed to be there for your wife and she probably needed space and privacy after that comment if she\u2019s really struggling with her mental health, not 25 people at her house who all just witnessed someone trying to humiliate her", "NTA. While I understand the people saying it was a d!ck move to kick everyone out for your brother's awful behavior, it's your responsibility as her partner to care for the wellbeing of your wife. You can hardly hold a good party without the mood being extremely uneasy and awkward for the guests if one of the hosts is locked in a room sobbing. As for the \"chill, it's just a joke!\" horse plop your brother pulled out, \"its just a joke\" is the last defense of a person who knows they took a flying leap over the line and are now trying to not be held responsible for their own actions. Jokes are funny. Jokes make people laugh. Jokes don't send someone into a crying fit. He was being the ahole and he damn well knew it.", "No judgement, but you essentially allowed your idiot brother to be the most important person in the room. Why allow him to ruin the party?\n\nHaving said that, like some others have said, the party was basically over anyway as your wife was so upset.", "YTA. Your brother was a MASSIVE asshole, but the other 20 people had nothing to do with that and just wanted to have a good time", "YTA. You kicked out 20-25 people based on the poor behavior of one. You could tell your brother to leave and ask your parents to act as hosts while you check on and support your wife.", "ESH. Obviously your brother is by far the bigger AH but you\u2019re also an AH for kicking everyone out. You should have made your brother leave and continued on without him.", "YTA. I don't see why everyone has to pay for your brothers jackassery. you should have kicked him and maybe your parents if they had made too much of a fuss protecting him.  Wild assumption but im going to guess your brother never got his degree.", "YTA\n\nIt would have been valid to ask *your brother* to leave after the comment but you cancelled on a bunch of people who had nothing to do with that. Some of whom passed up other stuff they could be doing to attend your party.\n\nIf I was a guest of yours i wouldn't plan to attend any more events at your house.", "I would have been with you if you just kicked out your brother, but 20ish people, some of whom drove hours to be there?\n\nThat's an AH move.\n\nYou didn't even check on your wife to see if she was alright first, or ask what she wanted to do.\n\nFor those reasons, YTA. For the record, your brother is too.", "YTA\n\nShould have torn your brother a new one and told him to grovel and say sorry to her, if he doesn't or won't, THEN kick him out. Fair enough it might have been a joke to him and he didn't know how much it was affecting her, but no one should ever disrespect someone's wife in their own home.\n\nYou've just punished everyone else to spite your brother", "YTA for punishing everyone when your brother is the one who should have been booted.", "ESH. Your brother is the biggest asshole. You're justified on kicking him out--and anyone who would've backed him up on such a heartless joke--but surely the BBQ wasn't just for your brother and parents. If friends/family drove hours to see you and had to go home early through no fault of their own, that's a bit sucky.\n\nAlso, based off of the post, it seems like you could've texted your wife that you kicked out the assholes and asked if she needed anything or how she wanted to handle the rest of the party. Am I correct in assuming you ended the BBBQ without her input?\n\nIt's lovely that you defended your wife! But I can definitely see why your friends/family are pissed off about the party ending early. That was pretty asshole of you. But, hey, you're married to your wife so she's your first priority. Though, in the future,  don't punish everyone for the mistake of a known asshole.", "Mild YTA. I understand that your wife's unemployment has been stressful for both of you. It is devastating to get that far in the interview process and not get the job.\n\nYour brother is an idiot, but you went a bit overboard. You could have just kicked him out. Or him and your parents if they had a problem with you asking your brother to leave. Throwing everyone out seems to be too much. But somehow I feel that there is more to the story.", "ESH. Your brother was the only one who deserved to be kicked out.", "Holy moly!!! You kicked out 20-25 people over the actions of one? That\u2019s a stupendous amount of power you just gave to your brother. What is missing from the story? What did the others do? Wouldn\u2019t kicking just him out have solved the problem? \n\nYTA", "YTA - You punished everybody for a comment one person made. Your brother is also TA, but only because of how your wife reacted. I personally think it\u2019s a pretty funny joke because people think a degree guarantees a job, which it doesn\u2019t. Overall, It\u2019s a situation that could\u2019ve been fixed by your brother just apologizing to your wife. You all overreacted and now it\u2019s a big thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s unfortunate for everyone but the party was already ruined.", "And quit sharing  personal stuff with your family. It's obvious they are not supportive. And it's none of their business.", "Not OP, but I know I wouldn't feel like hosting a party if my SO was crying in the other room after going through a really rough patch in life.", "Sometimes it's just easier to kick everyone out, and at that point the brother had ruined the mood of the wife, and of OP, which would make the party no longer wanted for the hosts, and so they had every right to just be done and not have to deal with hosting a party that had been emotionally tarnished.", "Came here to say this. 100% agree", "And let his wife cry in the bedroom alone? Or have to face people who witnessed her humiliation? Nope.", "NTA. hard to have a good time when your wife is crying in the bathroom.", "How does he continue when his wife is balling her eyes out and humiliated screw that good job standing by your wife \nNta", ">THEN kick him out\n\nwhat? kick him out regardless of what he does.", "Wow, if you think that joke is funny, you're a heartless bastard.", "How in the hell is that a funny joke?? It's just a smug and shitty way of putting her down.", "It\u2019s not a joke if it hurts people. In this case, the butt of the joke ran off crying. And you still came here to post that you think it\u2019s funny. And then you doubled down. \n\nGood lord, dude.", "Not to mention, it sounds like they were considering not having the party because she's in a rough spot. So, to go through with and try to have a good time and your spouse ends up crying in the bedroom. She ain't coming back out after that. \n\nThe host is out. Party's over.", "That\u2019s the standard for \u201cheartless bastard\u201d these days? Understanding the job market and knowing from first hand experience that your degree means nothing to anybody unless you can provide them economic value? I understand that a lot of people wasted years of their life getting degrees which aren\u2019t really helping them, but that fact doesn\u2019t make those degrees any less useless. A degree gets you an interview. Your expertise and soft skills get you the job. I\u2019ve seen masters students get passed up for bachelors.", "Probably the brother who thinks this shit is funny", "From the post:\n\n\\> My wife has been depressed lately losing her well paying job in November of last year. \n\n\\> She had a 3 phase interview for a job last week and didn\u2019t get picked at the end of it after almost a two month process.\n\nThe wife wouldn't have these two things if her degree was in some bullshit. And you don't go through a two month job interview if you're a bum.\n\nSounds like the wife is having a hard time. Which makes sense, as the whole job market right now is complete ASS for practically everyone because of the recent AI boom.", "You can have a degree in a high-paying, high-demand field and still not find a job because of your lack of experience and/or soft skills. My point, or from my assumption, the brother\u2019s joke, was to poke fun at people who think a degree is everything. It\u2019s funny because they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. A degree is good enough to get you through the door. It\u2019s your practical, real world knowledge and experience that matters to employers. I do see how that joke could be offensive or deep-cutting for some, but if I couldn\u2019t find a job and someone told me to rip up my degree of 4 years, i\u2019d find it funny because it\u2019s true."]}
