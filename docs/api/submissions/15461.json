She had a face that could have been an old twenty or a young forty. Or a vampire I guess. Either way, she was never inappropriate and she hung out with us all with no problem. We wildly speculated of course but she was part of the friend group and never lied.

The main problem with this person is that they were also lying in order to get at women.

Not to mention that I have been blessed in the sense that I still look like I\u2019m 20-22, so I really don\u2019t want there to be any misunderstandings about how old I am. Especially because in some cases I am 13 years older than the other students in my classes and I\u2019m really not trying to be this creepy 30 year old who\u2019s trying to trick teenagers into being friends with me. And yes, I can tell that some of my classmates feel awkward about my age (which is incredibly valid!!), but for the most part I\u2019ve found that very few of my classmates care and I\u2019ve kinda taken on a bit of a group mom role with my college friends. So while I can empathize with your friend that felt awkward being a non traditional aged student, it\u2019s still fucking creepy and quite honestly predatory that they lied about their age in an effort to make friends and date 18-22 year olds when they\u2019re almost 40. Not to mention, I don\u2019t know anyone my age who is trying to make friends with college aged kids. Like when I decided to start college at 30, I genuinely had no intention of making any friends because I knew I was going to be so much older than my classmates. And honestly, sometimes I feel like a creep for making friends with my classmates even though they all fully know my age and do not care that I\u2019m older. I cannot emphasize enough that this is REALLY creepy behavior.

INFO.", "I'm an older student, and while I don't lead with my age (a lot of people have mentioned being surprised) I also don't hide it. Given the wide variety of ages in our cohort I'm not surprised by someone who says they're 22 or 42. I think it's a problem to pursue someone without being honest about age, but I don't see it as a problem to not follow an introduction with an age. \n\nWhen you're a cohort and working together I don't think age is the most important factor, even within a friend group I don't think it's that important so long as if you're doing something that has an age restriction (serving alcohol, renting a hotel room) everyone meets those limits. \n\nThe lie is a problem, but what would have changed with a friend group if you had known their age from day 1? If they hadn't said anything, not lied, would you be upset at finding out the age later? If the honest answer is yes, then you might see from their point of view why they didn't want to discuss it in the first conversation, although clearly it just made things more difficult.", "Liar doesn\u2019t seem to have dated any of his classmates, per OP\u2019s account.

If you\u2019re substantially older, *especially* if you are pursuing romantic relationships, you should be upfront about that.\n\nWhen I was in undergrad (I was even on the younger side and graduated a year early) my major had a very small graduating class and a few students were older. I, as a 20 year old, had no problems working with 28-34 year olds, because they were all, you know, upfront about the fact we were at very different points in our lives.

It's tempting to say I'm 38 just to get over the first hurdle - it doesn't affect your personality etc etc. But I never do, because it's starting off with a lie.", "I\u2019m not OP, but I want to try to answer the question in your second paragraph, because I had to read the post a couple times to process it myself:\n\nAge can matter in a friend group if the gap is wide enough because of how closely correlated it is with life experience. Someone who\u2019s almost 40 will usually have much more experience navigating various relationships and situations, especially ones that friend groups in their late teens/early 20s are likely to be new to and exploring. I\u2019m honestly not sure how much this would or wouldn\u2019t impact my behavior (in some situations, I think I\u2019d be more comfortable making a fool of myself if I were with someone only slightly more experienced than myself because I\u2019d expect my inexperience to be less comical to them; in others I might view someone more experienced as a resource worth turning to), but even if my behavior didn\u2019t change, I\u2019d feel betrayed if I found out I\u2019d been assuming we were on near-equal footing while in reality they were at a substantial advantage. \n\nI think the best way I can put it is, it would feel like getting hustled, but their prize wouldn\u2019t be winning a bet but rather getting to laugh internally at my missteps. I don\u2019t mind being obviously new to something with someone who has a great deal of experience in it, but if they\u2019d pretended to be an amateur and I found out later that they were experts, I\u2019d feel like they\u2019d knowingly led me into new situations so they could be entertained by watching me fumble my way through. \n\nI\u2019d also be more on-guard for any red flags, because I\u2019d know they\u2019d have the life experience to be better at hiding their true nature if their nature was one worth hiding. Overall, I\u2019m not sure whether age would impact my behaviors, but it might impact my interpretation of the dynamics at play.", "INFO: why do you feel the need to use they/them pronouns when you've otherwise been very judgemental and dislike this person? Is it a man or a woman? just be honest. You liked them because you thought they were 25 but being 35 makes them abhorrent? yeah, have a long, hard look in the mirror.\n\nYou're really acting over the top in your reaction and there's some major ageism creeping in for sure.

At best, this is just weird.\n\nI worked for many years at a school where the teacher turnover was kind of high, so few teachers my age (mid-30s) stuck around, and newer and younger teachers (early 20s) were always coming in. My group of friends there consisted of another teacher my age and four others in their early 20s;  there's nothing weird about people of different ages being friends if everyone involved is behaving like a normal, respectful person.\n\nIf you're not trying to *take advantage* of someone bc they're younger, there's no reason to hide your age. I could've given Liar the benefit of the doubt and said \"maybe they were afraid of rejection\" if they hadn't actively pursued younger women and lying about his age. Why wasn't he pursuing partners his own age, outside of the college setting? The best thing Liar can hope for here is \"creepy\", but I'm thinking \"predatory\", really.", "NTA"]}
