I have been friends with Liar for over 3 years. We met in college and I introduced Liar to all of my friends because they were a transfer student at our school.

Liar was a pretty great person who treated all their friends with kindness. \nI knew so much about Liar including their family history, relationships, likes/dislikes, etc. However, I apparently never knew Liar\u2019s age. Liar told us that they were in their mid 20s as they were a non-traditional student. None of us were discriminating against age so we didn\u2019t care. We celebrated so many birthdays with Liar, but apparently ALL of them were the wrong birthdays. \n\n\nLiar left their drivers license at my apartment one day. I picked it up to text them that they left it but the bday date was weird. The birthday was in the 1980s. Liar was not in their mid 20s but actually higher 30s. I felt my heart drop because I had met Liar when I was a teenager freshly enrolled into college. I felt sick to my stomach so I called all of our friends and told them the news. Everyone started freaking out and we decided to confront Liar about this. \n\n\nWe wanted to hear Liar\u2019s reasoning before we continued on with the friendship. Basically, Liar just said that they didn\u2019t want to \u201cbe alone\u201d because of their age. Liar was also seeking out women who were in their young to mid 20s and was lying to the women they were seeing. Liar swore it was because they wanted friends but this story didn\u2019t add up because Liar\u2019s previous partners had no idea what their true age was either. All of us decided to sit on their reasoning for lying but we all came to the conclusion we want nothing to do with Liar. We cant seem to be past the malicious part of the lie because had Liar been truthful from the start, we would not be this upset. We all feel like we were robbed of a decision concerning if we would have gotten as close to an almost 40 year old had we known everything from the start.\n\n\nI started to ghost Liar for a few weeks until they texted me a large paragraph and blew up on me. They basically were yelling at me about how they didn\u2019t want to be abandoned and how I was being a terrible friend for not \u201cunderstanding.\" I proceeded to yell back as it was not fair for me to have to accept a shitty apology that was just a pity party. It was crazy to me that this person was almost 40 and was lying to everyone in their life and expected us to be cool with jt. I went to school the next day and told everyone Liar\u2019s real age - professors, students, and all. Everyone was so shocked and those who knew him were upset with the news. \n\n\nAITA for telling everyone Liar\u2019s true age?

People who are a decade older than each other are usually in different places, in a lot of ways. This tells me Liar is either very emotionally immature or predatory.

I went to college with a woman who I got the the impression was a bit older than most of us, but she was always just very vague about her actual age and never confirmed either way. She had a face that could have been an old twenty or a young forty. Or a vampire I guess. Either way, she was never inappropriate and she hung out with us all with no problem. We wildly speculated of course but she was part of the friend group and never lied. What your friend did was not that.", "Fair enough, lol", "I think you need to skip down two lines to do paragraphs in Reddit", "NTA. The main problem with this person is that they were also lying in order to get at women. Yes, admitting your age does limit you to people who are interested in getting together with those in your age group, but that's a good thing!", "Oh my god NTA \n\nI recently started college as a non traditional 31 year old student and I tell LITERALLY EVERYONE that I\u2019m 30. Not to mention that I have been blessed in the sense that I still look like I\u2019m 20-22, so I really don\u2019t want there to be any misunderstandings about how old I am. Especially because in some cases I am 13 years older than the other students in my classes and I\u2019m really not trying to be this creepy 30 year old who\u2019s trying to trick teenagers into being friends with me. And yes, I can tell that some of my classmates feel awkward about my age (which is incredibly valid!!), but for the most part I\u2019ve found that very few of my classmates care and I\u2019ve kinda taken on a bit of a group mom role with my college friends. So while I can empathize with your friend that felt awkward being a non traditional aged student, it\u2019s still fucking creepy and quite honestly predatory that they lied about their age in an effort to make friends and date 18-22 year olds when they\u2019re almost 40. Not to mention, I don\u2019t know anyone my age who is trying to make friends with college aged kids. Like when I decided to start college at 30, I genuinely had no intention of making any friends because I knew I was going to be so much older than my classmates. And honestly, sometimes I feel like a creep for making friends with my classmates even though they all fully know my age and do not care that I\u2019m older. I cannot emphasize enough that this is REALLY creepy behavior. Please please please avoid this person like the plague because this just gives me the biggest ick feeling.", "Nta", "As a 35 year old, it's really not ageist of op to be creeped out that a \"friend\" lied by a huge margin about his age specifically to get involved socially with barely adult people and to trick barely adult women into sex under false pretenses", "u seem to be taking the op's distaste for their \"friend's\" predatory ways suspiciously personally", "Calling that ageist is like saying a person who's only sexually attracted to men is misogynist. You're allowed to not feel comfortable being close friends with someone 15 years older than you! That's not evil!", "\"She had a face that could have been an old twenty or a young forty.\"\n\nSo, probabably in her thirties? Lol", "NTA. I\u2019m turning 40 this yr, and any young person that I\u2019m friendly with at works knows this. Not a university setting, but in a diverse workplace, you\u2019ll meet and be colleagues with a bunch of different ppl, so it\u2019s not inherently creepy to get on well with ppl outside your age bracket. It is creepy when you lie about it, and date ppl while lying.", "So was Liar dating young girls and lying about his age?  INFO.", "I'm an older student, and while I don't lead with my age (a lot of people have mentioned being surprised) I also don't hide it. Given the wide variety of ages in our cohort I'm not surprised by someone who says they're 22 or 42. I think it's a problem to pursue someone without being honest about age, but I don't see it as a problem to not follow an introduction with an age. \n\nWhen you're a cohort and working together I don't think age is the most important factor, even within a friend group I don't think it's that important so long as if you're doing something that has an age restriction (serving alcohol, renting a hotel room) everyone meets those limits. \n\nThe lie is a problem, but what would have changed with a friend group if you had known their age from day 1? If they hadn't said anything, not lied, would you be upset at finding out the age later? If the honest answer is yes, then you might see from their point of view why they didn't want to discuss it in the first conversation, although clearly it just made things more difficult.", "Liar doesn\u2019t seem to have dated any of his classmates, per OP\u2019s account. Although there is mention to \u201cpursuit\u201d so maybe he tried. Kinda ew."]}
