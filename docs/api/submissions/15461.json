I have been friends with Liar for over 3 years. We met in college and I introduced Liar to all of my friends because they were a transfer student at our school. We went to a lot of parties, clubs, pools, festivals, and more together with Liar. Liar was a pretty great person who treated all their friends with kindness. \nI knew so much about Liar including their family history, relationships, likes/dislikes, etc. However, I apparently never knew Liar\u2019s age. Liar told us that they were in their mid 20s as they were a non-traditional student. None of us were discriminating against age so we didn\u2019t care. We celebrated so many birthdays with Liar, but apparently ALL of them were the wrong birthdays. \nLiar left their drivers license at my apartment one day. I picked it up to text them that they left it but the bday date was weird. The birthday was in the 1980s. Liar was not in their mid 20s but actually higher 30s. I felt my heart drop because I had met Liar when I was a teenager freshly enrolled into college. I felt sick to my stomach so I called all of our friends and told them the news. Everyone started freaking out and we decided to confront Liar about this. \nWe wanted to hear Liar\u2019s reasoning before we continued on with the friendship. Basically, Liar just said that they didn\u2019t want to \u201cbe alone\u201d because of their age. Liar was also seeking out women who were in their young to mid 20s and was lying to the women they were seeing. Liar swore it was because they wanted friends but this story didn\u2019t add up because Liar\u2019s previous partners had no idea what their true age was either. All of us decided to sit on their reasoning for lying but we all came to the conclusion we want nothing to do with Liar. We cant seem to be past the malicious part of the lie because had Liar been truthful from the start, we would not be this upset. We all feel like we were robbed of a decision concerning if we would have gotten as close to an almost 40 year old had we known everything from the start.\nI started to ghost Liar for a few weeks until they texted me a large paragraph and blew up on me. They basically were yelling at me about how they didn\u2019t want to be abandoned and how I was being a terrible friend for not \u201cunderstanding.\" I proceeded to yell back as it was not fair for me to have to accept a shitty apology that was just a pity party. It was crazy to me that this person was almost 40 and was lying to everyone in their life and expected us to be cool with jt. I went to school the next day and told everyone Liar\u2019s real age - professors, students, and all. Everyone was so shocked and those who knew him were upset with the news. \nAITA for telling everyone Liar\u2019s true age?

People who are a decade older than each other are usually in different places, in a lot of ways. This tells me Liar is either very emotionally immature or predatory.

I went to college with a woman who I got the the impression was a bit older than most of us, but she was always just very vague about her actual age and never confirmed either way. She had a face that could have been an old twenty or a young forty. Or a vampire I guess. Either way, she was never inappropriate and she hung out with us all with no problem.
