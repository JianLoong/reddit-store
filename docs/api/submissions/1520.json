She constantly tells me and the people around me to tell me to be quiet (I have ADHD) and sometimes maybe i talk more then the average person and to silence me she throws pillows at me which i do not appreciate. She emotionally manipulates me, breaks every roommate agreement, and isolates me from my friends. I'm paying roughly $4400 a semester to live in the high quality honors dorms and have been reduced to sleeping on a bean bag in my neighbors room. I have consistently tried to speak to her woman to woman and every she dismisses me, ignores me, or promises to change and doesn't. \n\nNow to the current issue.

If you persist, they will have to either have a conduct hearing with your roommate or just allow a room switch. \n\nMost housing offices have only a few weeks a semester that room switches are allowed but obviously for situations like this exceptions can be made. Another secret - most universities keep a few vacant rooms for emergency situations wherein a student feels unsafe in their living situation. I\u2019m not sure this would apply but it might. Keep persisting.\n\nEditing to add - calling campus police is exactly what you should have done in a lockout situation. The reason being that they have to log it as an incident. A string of incidents is exactly what gets these situations escalated and therefore prioritized. NTA. I had a very similar roommate my freshman year and it was hell.
