There were 3 families there, 6 adults and 8 kids.  We took our boat and before we left I told my wife that the only thing I ask is that I have time to go fishing at least once during the trip.  I told her I would take the kids tubing, take people on leisurely boat rides, but that I want to go fishing at least one of the 3 nights we are there.  \n\nWhen I say at night, I mean at night.  The lake we were camping near is well known for its walleye fishing.  And anyone who fishes for walleye knows that the best bites come before sunrise and after sunset, sometimes late into the night, especially during the summer.  And after talking with a few locals, they said the night-time bite has been very good recently.  So my plan was to spend the days taking people out on the boat, and at least one night head out and do some night fishing.  \n\nThe first 2 nights I didn't get a chance to go out fishing because the other families had game nights planned and my wife wanted me to participate.  Think family-based games where each family is a team.  It was fun and I'm glad we did it, the kids ate it up.  The morning of our last full day there, I told my wife that I would be going fishing that night and she agreed.  \n\nAfter dinner on the 3rd night, I started getting everything ready to head out fishing.  It was about 8pm when I was just about to leave the dock.  My wife came running over in a panic.  One of her friend's family dogs had been hit by someone driving around on a golf cart.  The dog didn't make it.  She told me to come help her talk to the kids about it because they were all very upset.  \n\nI hung around for an hour or so and helped console the kids.  Obviously, everyone was pretty shaken up by it.  The kids of the family with the dog wanted to do a funeral service for the dog, so I stayed for that too.   By the time that ended, it was 930pm.  The adults got the kids settled in with a movie to try and calm them down, so I told my wife I was going to head out fishing.  \n\nShe immediately got mad and asked me how I could even think of fishing after what happened.  I told her there was nothing else for me to help with and that I was looking forward to fishing the entire trip.   I reminded her that she agreed it was OK, but she said that things changed and it would look bad if I go fishing while everyone else is helping her friends grieve.  \n\nI told her that I had done the family thing the entire weekend and that I'm sorry about what happened, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up the one thing I wanted to do for myself.  She just turned and walked away without saying anything.  \n\nI ended up fishing for a few hours and everyone was asleep when I got back.  My wife barely spoke to me the next day and the entire ride home.  She told me I made her and myself look bad by leaving like that when everyone else stayed to help.", "created_utc": 1685984261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141kvdm/aita_for_going_fishing_after_my_wifes_friends/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The kids could have been scared; they'd just watched a loved animal die and had to attend a pet-funeral on a family vacation, now imagine they woke up in the night and thought daddy had been hit by a car instead and were calling for you and you weren't there? I understand your frustration and this is shitty timing but this is a traumatic event and I do think you're a bit of an asshole for prioritizing yourself over the potential needs of your kids in this situation. Luckily it seems the kids did go to sleep okay, but I can understand why your wife is upset.", "Nta. You looked after the kids. Anything else is just to much", "NTA You're wife is being absurd.", "Your wife sure hates you fishing, doesn't she!  NTA.", "I\u2019m baffled by the whole \u201cwe had a funeral\u201c thing. Was this animal not taken to a vet? Was the dog buried at a camp ground that it doesn\u2019t sound like any of you own? I hold \u201cfunerals\u201d for some of my dogs, but I own the property they\u2019re buried on.", "NTA. You helped console the kids, but you also set a good example. When someone dies, we take time to mourn them, but then, even if we're sad, we keep on with our lives.\n\nWe had to put our dog down a few years back, and it was really sad for my kids, who'd always had the do around. But I talked about her passing as the last lesson that a pet teaches--how to deal with the emotions that come with the loss of a loved one. You mourn, but you need to pick yourself up and live even while you're sad.\n\nSo even if this had been your dog, I think you would have been fine going fishing. Given that it was a dog your family just met, your behavior was not just reasonable, but exemplary.", "NTA!

I understand that you wanted some time for yourself, but some time, being a parent mean you have to shape your priorities to fit what is best for your kids. The fact that they were \"fine\" when the movie started doesn't mean that they won't relapse later... You were lucky that nothing bad happened afterward.

I had just spent 2 full days taking everyone tubing and on boat rides.  Including multiple trips where the other parents just dumped their kids on my boat and told them to \"have fun\" while they stayed on shore.  I had been the glorified boat captain/babysitter all weekend and I did it with a smile even though I wanted to tell the other parents off, but didn't because they are my wife's friends.
