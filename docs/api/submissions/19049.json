There were 3 families there, 6 adults and 8 kids.  We took our boat and before we left I told my wife that the only thing I ask is that I have time to go fishing at least once during the trip.  I told her I would take the kids tubing, take people on leisurely boat rides, but that I want to go fishing at least one of the 3 nights we are there.  \n\nWhen I say at night, I mean at night.  The lake we were camping near is well known for its walleye fishing.  And anyone who fishes for walleye knows that the best bites come before sunrise and after sunset, sometimes late into the night, especially during the summer.  And after talking with a few locals, they said the night-time bite has been very good recently.  So my plan was to spend the days taking people out on the boat, and at least one night head out and do some night fishing.  \n\nThe first 2 nights I didn't get a chance to go out fishing because the other families had game nights planned and my wife wanted me to participate.  Think family-based games where each family is a team.  It was fun and I'm glad we did it, the kids ate it up.  The morning of our last full day there, I told my wife that I would be going fishing that night and she agreed.  \n\nAfter dinner on the 3rd night, I started getting everything ready to head out fishing.  It was about 8pm when I was just about to leave the dock.  My wife came running over in a panic.  One of her friend's family dogs had been hit by someone driving around on a golf cart.  The dog didn't make it.  She told me to come help her talk to the kids about it because they were all very upset.  \n\nI hung around for an hour or so and helped console the kids.  Obviously, everyone was pretty shaken up by it.  The kids of the family with the dog wanted to do a funeral service for the dog, so I stayed for that too.   By the time that ended, it was 930pm.  The adults got the kids settled in with a movie to try and calm them down, so I told my wife I was going to head out fishing.  \n\nShe immediately got mad and asked me how I could even think of fishing after what happened.  I told her there was nothing else for me to help with and that I was looking forward to fishing the entire trip.   I reminded her that she agreed it was OK, but she said that things changed and it would look bad if I go fishing while everyone else is helping her friends grieve.  \n\nI told her that I had done the family thing the entire weekend and that I'm sorry about what happened, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up the one thing I wanted to do for myself.  She just turned and walked away without saying anything.  \n\nI ended up fishing for a few hours and everyone was asleep when I got back.  My wife barely spoke to me the next day and the entire ride home.  She told me I made her and myself look bad by leaving like that when everyone else stayed to help.", "created_utc": 1685984261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141kvdm/aita_for_going_fishing_after_my_wifes_friends/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It does seem she wants to please everybody, at the expense of OP or even seeing OP as an extension of her \" we do what I would/want/will/ do\". And then punishing him for not doing eveeeery single thing her way. Op did his part, but the moment he gotta do something for himself, there is a problem.", "Point taken but I\u2019ve been married 20+ years and neither I nor my spouse would ever pull some bait and switch crap like this. She really does come off as controlling, doesn\u2019t she?!", "...wow. You're an idiot. Not this guy's circus, not his monkeys. It was already beyond reasonable to set aside what he wanted to do to make sure the kids were as settled in as possible. His wife is the unreasonable one here.\n\nNTA, OP. This guy I'm replying to is unreasonable.", "\ud83d\udc80", "\ud83d\udc80", "Nice. Mission accomplished \ud83d\udc4d", "Alt account of OP, lol dude, what I said at the end is food for thought, and for him to think about, or you, I can't be bothered to see if you're an alt, but I'm not American enough to call other people narcissist as one, it's something only I've seen Americans do, like stop being so ignorant. And go watch a tiktok or something.", "How about this: Silent-treatment in an adult relationship is breathtakingly childish and toxic.", "Or... you have a big blind spot where she concerned. At least consider the possibility, because unless you're leaving  something out, that's a bizarre response.", "I find it 100 times more narcissistic to think you can diagnose a mental disorder from 3 paragraphs online the anything he wrote.", "What she is valuing is not even her own kids nor husband, it's just the way the world is sometimes, but yeah nice way of hitting home, totally agree with you.", "Sorry OP I come from a farm family and they over share gorey details. My kids handle their own pets passing very well. But when we go visit the relatives and they get to discriptive of the details they get upset.", "Gotcha. That makes more sense. \n\nEither way I say NTA and honestly I was leaning the other way thinking \u201coh your poor kids\u201d but your wife saying that her problem was that it looked bad put me back to not the AH. She\u2019s not mad because the kids were upset. She\u2019s mad at the optics and frankly, that\u2019s kinda gross.", "\ud83d\udc36", "It's just hilarious you think you can diagnose someone based on 3 paragraphs of text from someone else when people with 8 years of collegiate education and 20 years of working in psychiatry say you can't diagnose based on that. It just seems narcissistic to me to think you know better than experts in the field.", "She was upset and didn't want to talk to me in that moment.  Not exactly the same as the silent treatment.  She was disappointed in my actions, which is an opinion she's entitled to.  We talked it out after we got home.", "It doesn't take a weatherman to tell which way the wind is blowing. \n\nOk, if you don't like his explanation, what's yours?  You're not really going to say that's a normal response, are you?", "Or maybe you see narcissists everywhere because you're looking for them.", "American being American", "Well if you talked it out, why are you on Reddit?", "> she barely spoke to me the next day and the entire ride home.\n\nHow is that not the silent treatment, how is that \"in the moment\"?\n\nYou're very intent on defending your wife's very shitty behavior.", "It's not a healthy response, sure but it's not a response that's isolated to narcissists. Not by a long shot", "So you know better than actual psychiatrists who say you can't diagnose a mental disorder based on 3 paragraphs of text from someone else? Your 0 years of training and experience are greater than people who have done 8 years of graduate studies and 20 years working in the field. Funny since we are talking about narcism, because that sure sounds like a narcissist to me.", "Actually, I'm just replying to outrageous stuff at least the way I see it. If there is no sign of it, cool, if so, I will say it regardless of how things are phrased.", "It sucks though, he probably will be in denial even when we give the heads up", "Sometimes it's nice to get some confirmation of your perspective. Doesn't mean OP signed up for an armchair diagnosis.", "So, no go on the alma mater?", "Yes OP is quite lucky the dog didn't come back and haunt all the children, could have been super scary", "The only thing I have for you is sapientia, virtus Amicitia, your anger is just proving my point more.", "You may be the captain but your wife comes off as wanting to be the cruise director. \n\nYou know her best but honestly seems like she was looking for an excuse to keep you on a short leash doing her bidding. If it weren\u2019t the dog, it woulda be something else.", "Still no credentials? Do you think it'd narcissistic to think you are able to diagnose mental disorders that most people go to 8 years of school and do a 4 year residency for? Zero training yet you know more then real psychiatrists who don't diagnose based on 3 paragraphs.", "Not angry at all, just curious about where you got your education in case one of my kids wants to go to college for psychology.  I want to be able to provide them with a good reference for where to go.", "I was simply trying to answer your questions to the best of my ability.", "I'm not American, I'm not on tiktok nor am I dumb, go live life, if you think you never encountered these type of people especially in the US, you're delusional, especially in coastal states, like monkey brain, you don't need creditenals, when you've dealt a lot with a specific type of person. People are not so unique as you may believe", "They got a reddit doctorate", "You don't need to study psychology to have good common sense. I have worked as a semi electrician before if that helps.", "Phew, thank God.  For a second there I was worried he was going to say Arizona State and I would have to immediately disregard everything he said as uncredible drivel.", "Well then, next time I need to replace a light bulb, I'll DM you.  Until then, maybe hang back on offering up any further diagnosis on mental health disorders."]}
