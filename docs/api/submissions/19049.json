There were 3 families there, 6 adults and 8 kids.  We took our boat and before we left I told my wife that the only thing I ask is that I have time to go fishing at least once during the trip.  I told her I would take the kids tubing, take people on leisurely boat rides, but that I want to go fishing at least one of the 3 nights we are there.  \n\nWhen I say at night, I mean at night.  The lake we were camping near is well known for its walleye fishing.  And anyone who fishes for walleye knows that the best bites come before sunrise and after sunset, sometimes late into the night, especially during the summer.  And after talking with a few locals, they said the night-time bite has been very good recently.  So my plan was to spend the days taking people out on the boat, and at least one night head out and do some night fishing.  \n\nThe first 2 nights I didn't get a chance to go out fishing because the other families had game nights planned and my wife wanted me to participate.  Think family-based games where each family is a team.  It was fun and I'm glad we did it, the kids ate it up.  The morning of our last full day there, I told my wife that I would be going fishing that night and she agreed.  \n\nAfter dinner on the 3rd night, I started getting everything ready to head out fishing.  It was about 8pm when I was just about to leave the dock.  My wife came running over in a panic.  One of her friend's family dogs had been hit by someone driving around on a golf cart.  The dog didn't make it.  She told me to come help her talk to the kids about it because they were all very upset.  \n\nI hung around for an hour or so and helped console the kids.  Obviously, everyone was pretty shaken up by it.  The kids of the family with the dog wanted to do a funeral service for the dog, so I stayed for that too.   By the time that ended, it was 930pm.  The adults got the kids settled in with a movie to try and calm them down, so I told my wife I was going to head out fishing.  \n\nShe immediately got mad and asked me how I could even think of fishing after what happened.  I told her there was nothing else for me to help with and that I was looking forward to fishing the entire trip.   I reminded her that she agreed it was OK, but she said that things changed and it would look bad if I go fishing while everyone else is helping her friends grieve.  \n\nI told her that I had done the family thing the entire weekend and that I'm sorry about what happened, but that shouldn't mean I have to give up the one thing I wanted to do for myself.  She just turned and walked away without saying anything.  \n\nI ended up fishing for a few hours and everyone was asleep when I got back.  My wife barely spoke to me the next day and the entire ride home.  She told me I made her and myself look bad by leaving like that when everyone else stayed to help.", "created_utc": 1685984261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141kvdm/aita_for_going_fishing_after_my_wifes_friends/", "score": 3243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your decision to go fishing right after the doggie funeral demonstrated that even when sad things happen, life goes on, and people can still enjoy things and get things done. It gave the message that we can participate in grieving with the community ritually, but that when the grief isn't particularly personal, when the ritual is over, life resumes as normal and an affectation of grief not felt is not required.\n\nI think there's value in both messages, and hope that you and your wife can have an open, non-accusatory conversation about grief that results in being on the same page about the interpretation of events and the messaging that goes with it. \n\nPersonally, I wish all people were free to express their felt grief for as long as they feel like it, and also that nobody is expected to playact at feeling grief if they don't. Attending the rituals **is** an important community act, and you did that.\n\nMy only unanswered question is this: did your wife want you to stay after the kids went to bed because she wanted your support through *her own personal grief for the dog?* If that was the case, and she either said so, or could reasonably expect you to know that she would be so broken up over someone else's dog, then you would actually be the A.

At first I thought maybe the dog was back at home and the family had gotten the news over the phone that the dog had been killed which would also be devastating. But now I realize this happened literally on the trip\u2026\n\n I don\u2019t know, I think if I was a kid on a camping trip for multiple days and there was a dog there with us and on the third day it got run over and died, I would be pretty upset about it whether it was my dog or not. I think if that happened now as an adult I would be very upset! Some of these other comments are kind of callous. That family\u2019s dog just died on their family vacation!! That\u2019s terrible. Was your wife upset? Who saw this accident happen??? Did any of the kids see the dog\u2019s body? Regardless that must have been a super emotional and stressful moment. Evidenced by how your wife came to you for support which is understandable, both from her perspective and your kids. She was probably so grateful you weren\u2019t on the water yet. I would have definitely wanted to hug my dad and make sure everyone I knew was okay if I was a kid in that situation. Then you acknowledged your kids were \u201cpretty upset\u201d but said the adults were getting them settled in to watch a movie at night. Did everyone actually fall asleep right away (like, before you left? Before you put your shoes back on even?) or did the kids stay up unable to fall asleep after what happened? or did they wake up during the night I wonder? You said everyone was asleep when you came back, what time was it? Did the parents whose dog died have to take care of the kids or were they able to step away for a bit and navigate this unexpected trip ruining event? Now they have to keep and potentially travel with a dead dog or its remains. Imagine going on a family trip with your dog riding in the car next to you and then driving home without him \u2639\ufe0f\n\nYou said this was around 9:30 pm you decided to go out, but other nights you guys did family game nights so you couldn\u2019t - how late were these game nights going? Was it a lot later than 9:30? Why not go out after those activities? I guess I\u2019m wondering if you feel your fishing plans were derailed the first 2 nights, were you planning on leaving before the kids went to sleep? On the 3rd night you said you were getting ready to leave after dinner and then were going to go out at 8 pm. So your wife was with your kids or someone else was watching them, and putting them to bed and everything, that\u2019s really nice. Maybe your wife felt totally cool with you taking off solo bc she knew the kids were having fun with their friends at night before bed and she would be maybe sharing kid-watching duties with her friends and it was just going to be chill? So if the kids were still awake and understandably upset, or she was up comforting her friends, she might have felt some resentment at you leaving, even if it might not be completely rational or fair to feel that way in your eyes. Would she like if you were closer with her friends? Have your kids ever experienced the sudden death of a pet or loved one before btw? I would definitely want my partner there with us for more than 90 minutes if my kids were going through that. \n\nIt\u2019s clear the first 2 nights you went along with the plans for your kids\u2019 happiness and that\u2019s still really great honestly, I hope they will always remember that about this trip too. but it definitely comes through in your post that you weren\u2019t interested, and that these are your wife\u2019s friends and not yours specifically so you participating in these activities was kind of a sacrifice and so therefore you are owed that time on your boat no matter what happens. As an introvert who gets mad when my alone time or plans in general get messed up, I definitely empathize so I\u2019m definitely not saying you needed to spend 24/7 with the others or anything\u2026\n\nBut here\u2019s how I see it, anything can happen when you\u2019re on vacation (like your dog getting run over potentially in front of you and your kids right?) and so leaving your Most Anticipated Activity to the last night is never a good idea. After the first night of zany late night activities, you could have communicated with your wife that night 2 you would definitely love to go out on the water afterwards and at what time so that you are able to do this activity and then be recharged for more family time, and what equivalent you could offer to her on this trip or in the future. To clarify I think it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t dip out on the family team stuff to go fishing, guaranteed your kids would remember that even more than the poor dog whose funeral these kids just planned on the fly to honor him. (That is such a heartbreaking image, those kids are very sweet and compassionate.) If you had gone out night 2, you could have had 2 guaranteed nights of fishing (and/or 2 early mornings? Why not go out in the mornings like you said, like 2 am to sunrise?) but because you couldn\u2019t go until the third night, your plans were on the verge of being ruined altogether and so you would have done anything to stick to it\u2026 It definitely sucks when things  happen that you don\u2019t expect that mess up your vacation, like if your dog were to get run over by a golf cart\u2026\n\nI think your wife saying it looked bad if you went fishing at that point was valid, because the way you phrased it makes it sound like the opening credits were rolling on a movie for your upset kids while you excused yourself to have fun\u2026 You could have probably waited another hour or two. Just from how you described this situation I feel like everyone knew you didn\u2019t care, and that you saw this as a huge inconvenience to you specifically and just couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell out of there to go fishing. Like, looking at it \u201cfairly\u201d of course you should have been able to just go out on the boat whenever you want even if your Wife\u2019s Friends\u2019 dog shockingly dies because they\u2019re not your friends and it\u2019s not your dog\u2026 YTA and I hope all the kids are okay.", "Fuck that. NTA.", "NTA. \"Helping her friends grieve\" ? Are you supposed to care about your wife's friends dog? Your wife needs to understand she doesn't own you.", "It sounds like you did plenty given that nobody can really do ANYTHING when someone\u2019s pet dies.  What is the expectation of you here?

I wouldn\u2019t expect everyone to have the level of grief I do about my own beloved animal \u2014 I would actually probably feel weird about dampening the mood by staying and being so upset, and would want to take my pet home and mourn in my home with my family. \n\nI\u2019m not judging these folks for staying, but I am surprised that your wife has such a strong judgement about your behaviour.

She loved to run.  She was a damn velociraptor constantly checking fences for weak spots.  She could go over, under, through a fence.  She knew who she could slide past at a door.  If we had company, i would try to keep my hand on her when they were coming or going from the house.  If i wasn't there, she would be across the room just looking like she was chilling but as soon as she saw her chance, boom sucka.  Out the door before you know she moved.   \n\nSo she had to constantly be leashed and she loved to be outside in the sun.  She learned how to slip her collar and run.  So i put her in a harness.  I kid you not, this damn dog learned how to roll on her back to unclip the harness from the dog run.  That's when i got a shock collar to work on training her to quit running off.  But she knew when the collar was on and when it wasn't, even though sometimes i'd just put it on her to get her used to it.   \n\nThis dog was the smartest dog i've ever known.  She was a lab/boxer mix, about 55lbs, and i met most of my neighbors in every place we lived in by asking if a flash of black lightning just went by them.  \"Do you mean the dog?\"  Yes, which way?  lol    \n\nShe 100% could not be caught if she didn't want to be.  \n\nMost of the time if she got out, it was because a kid accidentally let her out.  She LOVED kids, preferred them over adults, but she also knew they were no match for her.  ZOOOOOOOOM, sometimes even knocked them over so she could go for a nice lil run.   Sweetest, friendliest dog, but man the curse words i could come up with when she got loose.    \n\nI spent 15 years chasing that dog, always freaking out that she'd be hit by a car or something.
