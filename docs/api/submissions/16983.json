When my oldest two were 1, my ex-girlfriend and I split after I found out she cheated multiple times. We decided to \u201cco-parent,\u201d but she was incredibly distanced from the family. 4 months after she gave birth to my youngest son, she decided that she wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother and left. \r  \n\r\n\nI haven\u2019t seen her since. \r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, my mum envisioned a very specific life plan for me. She\u2019s always wanted to control my life; my education, career, and romantic relationships. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum loved my ex-girlfriend (my son\u2019s bio mum). To her, she was the perfect woman. Even after I told her the details of my ex walking out on my family, she still adores her. My mum even blames me for her leaving me (\u201cOh, you MUST have done something to make her leave.\u201d \u201cOh, you probably didn\u2019t treat her like a gentleman etc.). It\u2019s emotionally taxing and I don\u2019t speak to her much. To her, I\u2019ll always be a failure.  A disappointment. And she has made her thoughts very clear to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend, \u201cFiona,\u201d and I have been dating for 3 years. When I met her, I wasn\u2019t actively looking for a relationship, but I\u2019m so incredibly happy I met her. She\u2019s wonderful and I can\u2019t wait for her to officially be a part of my family. The boys love her (my youngest calls her mum), and I love her. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, of course, does not. She does not like Fiona at all. Because she\u2019s not my ex (and thank God she isn\u2019t), Fiona will never be good enough. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad invited us to celebrate my mum\u2019s birthday. My dad told me that if I brought Fiona, he would ensure that there would be no drama. \r  \n\r  \nI wish it was a nice, calm, afternoon spent with family. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum is a heavy drinker. Late into the afternoon, after having way too much to drink, she starts \u201cplayfully,\u201d chasing my son around the yard. He\u2019s scared, crying, and runs to Fiona. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, extremely drunk, begins to curse out a 7-year-old boy for running away from her. Fiona, interjects and yells at my mum that she can\u2019t yell at \u201cher son.\u201d (Her words). \r  \n\r  \nThis sets my mum off. After hearing Fiona refer to the children as her own, my mum begins ranting (loudly) about how Fiona will never be the boy\u2019s bio mum (their \u201creal\u201d mum) and how their \u201creal\u201d mother would have never poisoned their heads and caused them to be afraid of their own grandmother. \r  \n\r  \nFiona is in shock, but I loudly yell back, \u201cMaybe my kids are scared of you cause you\u2019re a fucking monster!\u201d \r  \n\r  \nFiona, the kids, and I left shortly after. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad texted me. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t have called my mother a monster when she was clearly having a breakdown. My mum is having a hard time accepting Fiona, and hearing Fiona was probably the last straw. He\u2019s encouraging me to apologize before my mum apologizes. He wants to clear the air and everything to return to normal. \r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to do that.", "created_utc": 1683824857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13etaoz/aita_for_calling_my_mother_a_fucking_monster_as/", "score": 2666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s shaking things up! Which is why your mother hates her. \n\nAnyway, point is NTA. Your children should not be subjected to drunken adults chasing and cursing at them.

That's on her.", "Mom has main character syndrome; her view of OP's ex will not be shifted by something as trivial as reality. And Fiona is in the way of the reality she wants.\n\nDad is a boat steadier.  If he steadies the boat enough, he can pretend that Mom isn't trying to dunk them all into the lake. He uses alternate reality to do this:  it's a breakdown, not a drunk tantrum!!  (She's ill, not an AH) If OP apologizes first, Mom can stay in her fantasy world and not disturb Dad.", "Sounds like OPs dad needs to go to copedendents anonymous and Alanon to learn boundaries. Good on OP for setting a boundary!", "Dad is codependent.  It is common for a person who\u2019s love one is a addict.  They make excuses to cover up things.  It is helps them manage an unmanageable situation.  Dad needs to seek help to help him see the destructive relationship he is in", "Holy SHIT this is exactly what my dad does now! My mum isn't an absolute tyrant, just a bit of an asshole, but my old man can't see anything wrong with how he just enables it.", "Good point. He promised and didn't follow through. What a mess. Sometimes, good people have the worst parents. Sorry OP. You deserve better. It's clear why your mom liked your ex so much. They're clearly birds of a feather.

Seriously go NC with both of them. Block numbers etc. Put as much distance between you as possible. This is only going to turn into the crazy-x-girlfriend-stalker situation here. You mom is beyond your abilities to fix. Move away and leave no forwarding address. Change phone numbers, emails etc. Go into your own made witness protection program. If you don't she will be breaking into your home holding a box of cereal hostage with a kitchen knife at 2am.", "NTA sometimes the hard thing to do and the right thing to do are the same thing. I would stay strong on this one, she was acting like a monster.", "Your mom is the AH monster that traumatized your children and hurt you in many ways.\n\nYour dad is the AH that promised no drama but lacked the actual spine to back up his promise.\n\nYou are NTA for telling her off, and also you probably you should keep your dad in check, because he is enabling a very unhealthy attitude from his wife, and that might eventually burn his relationship to your kids.", "NTA", "NTA - and that wasn\u2019t a mental breakdown that was a drunk old lady being a drunk old mean lady. Good luck to you and \u201cFiona\u201d and the kiddo, hope you distance your child from that awful grandmother", "NTA. Rock the boat - your dad is so used to desperately trying to stabilize in the waves that your mom keeps making that he doesn\u2019t even know what calm water looks like. His \u201cnormal\u201d is your mom\u2019s drama\u2026 so when somebody else is getting out of the boat instead of helping him stabilize it, he forgets that the person to blame for the drama is the person who made the waves in the first place (your mom), not the person who has decided to find calmer waters instead of spending all their energy dealing with the waves.\n\nDoes anybody have a link to the article or whatever it was that explained this concept so well? I read it ages ago, might have been a year or two now, but it applies so perfectly to this situation!", "Wait. So your mom is a drunk. She invalidates you. She sides with your cheating ex and sings her praises even though she walked out on her responsibility as a mother. She scared her grandchildren.

Like, not even marginally close!! You\u2019re moms a fucking bitch and if I were you I\u2019d cut all contact. Neither you, your boys, nor Fiona need or deserve that kind of bullshit in your lives. Life is difficult enough on its own.", "NTA. And playing the mental illness card is no excuse- if she's that upset this long after she needs therapy. But either way it's not a reasonable justification.", "NTA- Let's put this throw the eyes of your child: it's grandma's birthday and he hasn't seen her in a while. Then she gets drunk and starts chasing him around. He then runs to the only mother figure he's ever known for protection. Then his crazy grandma starts screaming and cussing.

She is an absolute fucking monster. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to have a \u201chard time accepting\u201d someone your child loves unless that person is abusive to them or their kids.

Your mom isn\u2019t ever going to. Screw that.", "NTA. I don't consider that a meltdown. That was a drunken rant. Consider going low/no contact with your mom and be very careful of when you allow her to be around your kids. She should only be allowed to see the kids under strict rules (no drinking, no badmouthing Fiona, etc). If you are determined to maintain a relationship with your mom, consider that there are times it may be best if you visit her or go to her events alone.
