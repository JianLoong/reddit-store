When my oldest two were 1, my ex-girlfriend and I split after I found out she cheated multiple times. We decided to \u201cco-parent,\u201d but she was incredibly distanced from the family. 4 months after she gave birth to my youngest son, she decided that she wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother and left. \r  \n\r\n\nI haven\u2019t seen her since. \r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, my mum envisioned a very specific life plan for me. She\u2019s always wanted to control my life; my education, career, and romantic relationships. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum loved my ex-girlfriend (my son\u2019s bio mum). To her, she was the perfect woman. Even after I told her the details of my ex walking out on my family, she still adores her. My mum even blames me for her leaving me (\u201cOh, you MUST have done something to make her leave.\u201d \u201cOh, you probably didn\u2019t treat her like a gentleman etc.). It\u2019s emotionally taxing and I don\u2019t speak to her much. To her, I\u2019ll always be a failure.  A disappointment. And she has made her thoughts very clear to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend, \u201cFiona,\u201d and I have been dating for 3 years. When I met her, I wasn\u2019t actively looking for a relationship, but I\u2019m so incredibly happy I met her. She\u2019s wonderful and I can\u2019t wait for her to officially be a part of my family. The boys love her (my youngest calls her mum), and I love her. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, of course, does not. She does not like Fiona at all. Because she\u2019s not my ex (and thank God she isn\u2019t), Fiona will never be good enough. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad invited us to celebrate my mum\u2019s birthday. My dad told me that if I brought Fiona, he would ensure that there would be no drama. \r  \n\r  \nI wish it was a nice, calm, afternoon spent with family. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum is a heavy drinker. Late into the afternoon, after having way too much to drink, she starts \u201cplayfully,\u201d chasing my son around the yard. He\u2019s scared, crying, and runs to Fiona. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, extremely drunk, begins to curse out a 7-year-old boy for running away from her. Fiona, interjects and yells at my mum that she can\u2019t yell at \u201cher son.\u201d (Her words). \r  \n\r  \nThis sets my mum off. After hearing Fiona refer to the children as her own, my mum begins ranting (loudly) about how Fiona will never be the boy\u2019s bio mum (their \u201creal\u201d mum) and how their \u201creal\u201d mother would have never poisoned their heads and caused them to be afraid of their own grandmother. \r  \n\r  \nFiona is in shock, but I loudly yell back, \u201cMaybe my kids are scared of you cause you\u2019re a fucking monster!\u201d \r  \n\r  \nFiona, the kids, and I left shortly after. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad texted me. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t have called my mother a monster when she was clearly having a breakdown. My mum is having a hard time accepting Fiona, and hearing Fiona was probably the last straw. He\u2019s encouraging me to apologize before my mum apologizes. He wants to clear the air and everything to return to normal. \r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to do that.", "created_utc": 1683824857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13etaoz/aita_for_calling_my_mother_a_fucking_monster_as/", "score": 3577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s shaking things up! Which is why your mother hates her. \n\nAnyway, point is NTA. Your children should not be subjected to drunken adults chasing and cursing at them.

Does your dad usually enable her and try to cover up for her? \n\nWas it right to say that to your mom? No. Nothing good or helpful comes from arguing with a drunk.

You don't have to, but you can. Taking the high road is okay.

Fiona is that childs mum in all but biology your child made it clear and Fiona's reaction validated their trust in her. \n\nYour mother is a toxic drunk and your father enables her.", "NTA \n\nlet me get this right... your partner has taken on the role of being a mum to young boys, loves them like \"her own\", defends them and despite not being liked by your mum is still willing to celebrate her birthday with the family...and SHES the problem !?!?!\n\nNo one is the AH here except your mum, which sucks to hear as its your mum but I personally wouldn't apologise to her at all. That wasn't a breakdown that was her spitting her dummy out the pram. Your boys have a wonderful mum and she needs to accept that", "NTA and also not even having a breakdown justifies chasing a kid around", "Nta and nope time to go low contact with mummy dearest", "It sounds like your mom is an alcoholic and your dad enables her.", "NTA. And forget about all of it. Your mom's not worth the time of day", "NTA \n\nWell done on having your partners back. \nI'm glad you defended your partner and child. \n\n\nYour mum has some issues to deal with.\n That's on her, not you. \n\n\nOn another note, how amazing is Fiona \ud83d\udc4f \nSome women a more maternal than others, and Fiona is a Mama ! \nSounds like you have created a loving, strong family unit together \u2764\ufe0f", " NTA", "Please, if you can, go non-contact with your \"mother\". If not for you, do it for your children. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother is a drunk who was abusing your child by scaring him, not having a breakdown. Your dad is in denial. I suggest you keep them away from Fiona and the kids.", "Cudos to Fiona. Already has her \"Mama Bear\" badge. As far as your dad is concerned, you need to have a come to Jesus talk with him and tell him to GROW A PAIR. The enabling behavior is what allows your mom to keep acting this way. DON'T LET EITHER OF THEM DICTATE HOW YOU LIVE OR RAISE YOUR KIDS!!! Good luck OP.", "Your mom sounds like someone I hope I never meet. NTA\n\nStay away until she gets sober", "NTA she seems to be a monster. Go no or low contact", "NTA. That\u2019s not a breakdown, that\u2019s just a heartless human being with their inhibitions down. Protect your family from her at all costs.", "NTA, at all, maybe time for no contact? Not to mention, your mother absolutely owes your family an apology for being a psycho, but so does your pushover dad for promising no drama & not doing anything to help keep that promise", ">He\u2019s encouraging me to **apologize before my mum apologizes**. He wants to clear the air and everything to return to normal.\n\nNope, that's enabling her behaviour by \"not rocking the boat\"!\n\nNTA, stick to your guns", "NTA, tell your Mother to f\\*\\*k off and remove access to your children from her, she does not deserve it.", "NTA - your dad sucks too. \n\nYour parents clearly have issues and it sounds like you don\u2019t even like them. Some distance sounds like the right medication to me.", "NTA - Cut off the witch tell your old man he can like it or lump it but she's never gonna see the kids. \n\nPeople will often show their true colors when intoxicated. The witch won't change. Protect your missus and kids.", "NTA. \n\nYour mother was having a drunken tantrum, not a breakdown. You and Fiona have nothing to apologise for, this is all on your mother.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a breakdown. It\u2019s a dumb drunk outburst that she should be ashamed of. \n\nDo not apologise ever.", "NTA do not apologize. You weren't at fault, instead you mother should be apologising to your child, Fiona and you. Her behaviour considering her age is not normal and she wasn't having a mental breakdown she was throwing a tantrum.", "NTA do not apologize. You weren't at fault, instead you mother should be apologising to your child, Fiona and you. Her behaviour considering her age is not normal and she wasn't having a mental breakdown she was throwing a tantrum.", "NTA. Your dad is, unfortunately, enabling your mother\u2019s drinking and bad behavior. That\u2019s his choice, albeit an unhealthy and ultimately destructive one. You are not obligated to enable your mom or to support your dad\u2019s decision to enable her. You\u2019re 100% entitled to make the healthy decision to protect your kids and the woman you love from the damaging consequences of your mom\u2019s alcohol abuse and antagonism. \n\nAl-Anon can be a great resource. If nothing else, reading their materials and/or connecting with their program will reinforce that you\u2019re making healthy choices Re your mom, and (hopefully) defuse some of the guilt and blame your well-meaning but misguided father sows when he pressures you to enable her, too.", "Please don't apologise to your mother. \n\nFiona sounds amazing - do something nice for the woman your child runs to. \n\nNTA", "NTA. And don\u2019t do it. Instead of sticking up for you and for what was right all these years, your dad preferred to let your mum hurt you to keep the peace. Tell your dad that you\u2019re no longer accepting that arrangement. Things have changed. No apologies will be forthcoming. And he needs to do better as a dad and a grandfather.", "Tell your dad you will apologize 6 months after she enters rehab. \n\nActive Alcoholics and kids do not mix well. I say this as a sober alcoholic.\n\nNta", "NTA. As someone who has frequent meltdowns, a mental breakdown is not an excuse to project feelings onto others. She needs to be talking to a professional instead of lashing out at a 7 year old for not wanting an adult to chase them. (I can imagine how frightening that is!)\n\nBut I'm going to be honest, I'm not really sure if there's a relationship to be had if this is how she's treating you all. I think it's about high time to start cutting back on visiting your mom. But I also know family is hard, and while it's easy for me to cut my family out, I do recognize that it's not so easy for others. Best of luck!", ">My mum is a heavy drinker.  \n>  \n>My mum, extremely drunk, begins to curse out a 7-year-old boy for running away from her.\n\nNTA - It's because she doesn't have personal boundaries and has an excessive need for control.", "Nope. I'd tell her she's nothing but a disloyal source of pain to me... for my whole life. If she loves the wretched woman who ruined her sons life and broke his heart then she should go find her. That I'll gladly step out of the way and my cheating ex wife can be her new child. That she's no longer welcome in my life or my kids life. And I'd tell my dad that he keeps ending how she treats me then he can go too.", "NTA!!!  Your statement holds true.  That\u2019s not a \u201cbreakdown,\u201d it\u2019s a full-blown temper tantrum, and it\u2019s not your fault. Sounds like this type of behavior towards you has been going on for years.  Do you really think it would stop if you simply apologized?  Even if your mom apologizes to you first, keep your distance from now on.  And if your parents want to visit, maybe your dad can, but tell your mom she can stay her drunk ass at home. Yikes.", "NTA. There is no \"going back to normal\" when it wasn't a healthy situation to begin with.\n\nObviously your father is not able to prevent her from disrespecting your girlfriend and you, and by extension your children.\n\nI would distance myself from your mother if it were me, and make clear that if she wants a relationship with your family, her attitude needs to change because you will not be giving her endless chances to change.", "NTA. Your mother wasn't having a breakdown, she was filthy drunk! The child would have been terrified!\n\nThings cannot return to normal until your mother sobers up and stops terrorizing children (and your GF). You are right to keep your family away from her under the circumstances.", "Cutting contact seems dramatic. I think a sober sit down and try and clear the air, with the old man involved, is worth a shot. Say you\u2019re prepare d to forgive but not forget. If she drinks around the kids again that\u2019s the last time she sees them. Maybe it will wake her up and be good for her. \n\nAs parents get older the roles get reversed and the  kids need to \u201cparent\u201d the old folks. That means sucking it up, stepping up, making some boundaries and holding firm. But it doesn\u2019t mean walking out when times get tough.", "OP, this is the correct response.  \nI feel so bad for you. What a tough situation. \nYou can't change other people. You can coach and encourage them to do better and see it your way, but ultimately they need to make their own choices. If this proposed response doesn't do that, then it's up to you to decide how to move forward. I have literally never said this before on Reddit, but I would support all of the people suggesting no or limited contact. At least until your mom seeks help for her drinking and your dad recognizes the problem. \nAgain, I'm so sorry OP. This sounds very tough. Hold tight to the good people who give you joy...Fiona and your three children ."]}
