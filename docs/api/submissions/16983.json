When my oldest two were 1, my ex-girlfriend and I split after I found out she cheated multiple times. We decided to \u201cco-parent,\u201d but she was incredibly distanced from the family. 4 months after she gave birth to my youngest son, she decided that she wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother and left. \r  \n\r\n\nI haven\u2019t seen her since. \r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, my mum envisioned a very specific life plan for me. She\u2019s always wanted to control my life; my education, career, and romantic relationships. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum loved my ex-girlfriend (my son\u2019s bio mum). To her, she was the perfect woman. Even after I told her the details of my ex walking out on my family, she still adores her. My mum even blames me for her leaving me (\u201cOh, you MUST have done something to make her leave.\u201d \u201cOh, you probably didn\u2019t treat her like a gentleman etc.). It\u2019s emotionally taxing and I don\u2019t speak to her much. To her, I\u2019ll always be a failure.  A disappointment. And she has made her thoughts very clear to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend, \u201cFiona,\u201d and I have been dating for 3 years. When I met her, I wasn\u2019t actively looking for a relationship, but I\u2019m so incredibly happy I met her. She\u2019s wonderful and I can\u2019t wait for her to officially be a part of my family. The boys love her (my youngest calls her mum), and I love her. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, of course, does not. She does not like Fiona at all. Because she\u2019s not my ex (and thank God she isn\u2019t), Fiona will never be good enough. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad invited us to celebrate my mum\u2019s birthday. My dad told me that if I brought Fiona, he would ensure that there would be no drama. \r  \n\r  \nI wish it was a nice, calm, afternoon spent with family. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum is a heavy drinker. Late into the afternoon, after having way too much to drink, she starts \u201cplayfully,\u201d chasing my son around the yard. He\u2019s scared, crying, and runs to Fiona. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, extremely drunk, begins to curse out a 7-year-old boy for running away from her. Fiona, interjects and yells at my mum that she can\u2019t yell at \u201cher son.\u201d (Her words). \r  \n\r  \nThis sets my mum off. After hearing Fiona refer to the children as her own, my mum begins ranting (loudly) about how Fiona will never be the boy\u2019s bio mum (their \u201creal\u201d mum) and how their \u201creal\u201d mother would have never poisoned their heads and caused them to be afraid of their own grandmother. \r  \n\r  \nFiona is in shock, but I loudly yell back, \u201cMaybe my kids are scared of you cause you\u2019re a fucking monster!\u201d \r  \n\r  \nFiona, the kids, and I left shortly after. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad texted me. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t have called my mother a monster when she was clearly having a breakdown. My mum is having a hard time accepting Fiona, and hearing Fiona was probably the last straw. He\u2019s encouraging me to apologize before my mum apologizes. He wants to clear the air and everything to return to normal. \r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to do that.", "created_utc": 1683824857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13etaoz/aita_for_calling_my_mother_a_fucking_monster_as/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wasn't having a meltdown... she was acting like an unhinged AH.", "NTA\n\nYour father wants to keep the peace by not holding your mother accountable for her actions - it sounds like a bad environment for your family. You'd be well within your rights to go NC or LC with your mother.", ">He told me that I shouldn\u2019t have called my mother a monster when she was clearly having a breakdown\n\nUh, no. She was having a tantrum. She is dangerous to your children. She is appallingly disrespectful of you, Fiona, and the children. NTA but I really think you should limit contact between your kids and her.", "NTA that wasn't a mental breakdown, that was an alcoholic hitting rock bottom. Now it's all on your mom to apologize and get her shit together. Good for you and your girlfriend for protecting your kids and defending each other.", "How could you be anything other than NTA?  Your mother idolizes a woman who cheated on her son and deserted your mother's grandchildren, and who gets drunk, frightens a child, and insults a guest.  I'd say \"monster\" is a fine judgment and on a practical note may give you even more breathing room than you have now.", "NTA tbh.  Will she understand what you mean and change?  Probably not.  Your mother sounds like someone you need to protect yourself and your family from.", "NTA Tell your father she needs to apologize first. She was scaring literal children while drinking. Why is he ok with that apparently?", "NTA. I hate when people in the right have to apologize to keep peace in the family or appease an older person.\n\nTell dad that it was not a breakdown. It was a drunk rant. She got drunk. She misbehaved. \n\nI would also tell dad that maybe the kids won't stay after mom has her second or third.", "NTA. Perhaps not the optimal reaction, but in the heat of the moment, it is entirely understandable. \n\nYour mum needs to take responsibility for her drinking, the way she behaves when she\u2019s drinking, and the things that happen as a result.", "Do not apologise\n  NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is a controlling, abusive alcoholic who needs everyone to constantly soothe and indulge her. Including your children, your girlfriend, your dad, and you.\n\nShe will always have a breakdown whenever anyone won\u2019t give into her. That\u2019s how she maintains control.", "NTA   Sounds like she was being horrible. If you want to smooth things over slightly but still letting the mother know it was unacceptable, you could maybe amend it to, \"I should have said 'You were acting like a monster,' which you were.\" Or \"Maybe you don't know what a monster you act like when you're so drunk.\"  \n\nOr softer, \"Obviously, I don't think you're a monster. I love you. But your constant defending of a woman who cheated on me and abandoned her children is very painful and difficult to be around. Bringing her up is painful and confusing for the children she abandoned. You being totally drunk around young children and chasing them around screaming at the woman they love and trust scares them. I'm sorry if that's hard to hear, but it's true, and I won't subject myself, or the children, to that behavior. And I won't tolerate anymore of this ongoing talk about the ex, either. She's gone by her choice. Stop talking about her around me.\"", "NTA she wasn't having a breakdown she was drunk and rude.

It must be so hard for her to accept that their father has found a loving partner that loves her grandchildren and that her grandchildren love and trust in return. Surely this situation is worthy of a breakdown.", "NTA.\n\nAt some time in his life, your dad gave up.  He decided that it was easier to just accept your mom at her worst and pretend-away all the bad things she does.  So he enables her and convinces everyone to gaslight themselves.\n\nYou deserve better and your dad would greatly benefit from therapy.  Your mother is probably a lost cause and your father's problem to deal with.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t having a breakdown, she was drunk.", "NTA- it wasn\u2019t a breakdown it was a drunken tirade.

What\u2019s happening here is that your mother behaved in a way that was wildly inappropriate, and was linked to her overconsumption of alcohol. Sounds like it\u2019s not the first time. Your father, her enabler, would like nothing more than to smooth things out because that\u2019s his role in the family: to keep consequences from happening to your mother. Your are used to this dynamic, so you feel torn between loyalties to your kids and to helping your father enable your mother\u2019s bad behavior. \n\nMeanwhile Fiona, coming from the outside, rightly sees the problems with the way your mother treats her grandkids, you, and her. She\u2019s shaking things up! Which is why your mother hates her. \n\nAnyway, point is NTA. Your children should not be subjected to drunken adults chasing and cursing at them. Fiona\u2019s reaction and your reaction to this situation were completely reasonable. \n\nPlease read about adult children of alcoholics. Fiona seems great, make sure you keep talking to her about these issues.", "NTA ask yourself what your kids gain by spending time with an alcoholic who degrades their father, dismisses their mother and screams at them.

It will be up to her to listen but at least you would have tried. Good luck to you, Fiona and the kids. I hope you have a wonderful life together.", "Doesn't sound like a breakdown at all but a drunk woman terrorizing a child. Your dad must be very used to this behavior if this was his reaction. I can see how Fiona calling your son \"her\" son could rankle a grandmother but she's out of control and has a problem with alcohol. If your dad thinks this is a breakdown, then he should get her into rehab. Otherwise, keep your distance from her for you and your child. NTA.", "NTA.  You owe your mother no apologies.  Her behavior has been awful and chasing your grandchild around to scare them is absolutely monstrous.", "Your mom sucks. Cut her off. NTA", "Nta. She's not having a breakdown, she's just a miserable drunk who wants others to be miserable too.

Your mother is a toxic alcoholic, no offense. Fiona may not be the biological mother of your children, but she's present and she cares. The kids obviously love her. Your mother needs to apologize to Fiona as well as the kids for scaring them like that. That was just extremely inappropriate. Right now, your dad is just enabling her by saying you have to apologize first.", "NTA.\n\nDo not apologize; you were defending your child from a nasty, aggressive drunk.  The fact that it was your mother who was the drunk is besides the point.\n\nTell your father that he is enabling your mother's alcoholism and terrible behavior, and that he should bring her to both rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous.  You should further suggest that your father himself attend [Al-Anon](https://al-anon.org/), to get the support HE needs to help your mother.", "All of this happened in front of your kid, who was already scared of her.

She's \"having a hard time\"?  IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS.
