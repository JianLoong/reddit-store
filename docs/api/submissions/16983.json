When my oldest two were 1, my ex-girlfriend and I split after I found out she cheated multiple times. We decided to \u201cco-parent,\u201d but she was incredibly distanced from the family. 4 months after she gave birth to my youngest son, she decided that she wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother and left. \r  \n\r\n\nI haven\u2019t seen her since. \r  \n\r  \nGrowing up, my mum envisioned a very specific life plan for me. She\u2019s always wanted to control my life; my education, career, and romantic relationships. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum loved my ex-girlfriend (my son\u2019s bio mum). To her, she was the perfect woman. Even after I told her the details of my ex walking out on my family, she still adores her. My mum even blames me for her leaving me (\u201cOh, you MUST have done something to make her leave.\u201d \u201cOh, you probably didn\u2019t treat her like a gentleman etc.). It\u2019s emotionally taxing and I don\u2019t speak to her much. To her, I\u2019ll always be a failure.  A disappointment. And she has made her thoughts very clear to me.\r  \n\r  \nMy girlfriend, \u201cFiona,\u201d and I have been dating for 3 years. When I met her, I wasn\u2019t actively looking for a relationship, but I\u2019m so incredibly happy I met her. She\u2019s wonderful and I can\u2019t wait for her to officially be a part of my family. The boys love her (my youngest calls her mum), and I love her. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, of course, does not. She does not like Fiona at all. Because she\u2019s not my ex (and thank God she isn\u2019t), Fiona will never be good enough. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad invited us to celebrate my mum\u2019s birthday. My dad told me that if I brought Fiona, he would ensure that there would be no drama. \r  \n\r  \nI wish it was a nice, calm, afternoon spent with family. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum is a heavy drinker. Late into the afternoon, after having way too much to drink, she starts \u201cplayfully,\u201d chasing my son around the yard. He\u2019s scared, crying, and runs to Fiona. \r  \n\r  \nMy mum, extremely drunk, begins to curse out a 7-year-old boy for running away from her. Fiona, interjects and yells at my mum that she can\u2019t yell at \u201cher son.\u201d (Her words). \r  \n\r  \nThis sets my mum off. After hearing Fiona refer to the children as her own, my mum begins ranting (loudly) about how Fiona will never be the boy\u2019s bio mum (their \u201creal\u201d mum) and how their \u201creal\u201d mother would have never poisoned their heads and caused them to be afraid of their own grandmother. \r  \n\r  \nFiona is in shock, but I loudly yell back, \u201cMaybe my kids are scared of you cause you\u2019re a fucking monster!\u201d \r  \n\r  \nFiona, the kids, and I left shortly after. \r  \n\r  \nMy dad texted me. He told me that I shouldn\u2019t have called my mother a monster when she was clearly having a breakdown. My mum is having a hard time accepting Fiona, and hearing Fiona was probably the last straw. He\u2019s encouraging me to apologize before my mum apologizes. He wants to clear the air and everything to return to normal. \r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t want to do that.", "created_utc": 1683824857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13etaoz/aita_for_calling_my_mother_a_fucking_monster_as/", "score": 550, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s shaking things up! Which is why your mother hates her. \n\nAnyway, point is NTA. Your children should not be subjected to drunken adults chasing and cursing at them.

I hope you have a wonderful life together.", "Doesn't sound like a breakdown at all but a drunk woman terrorizing a child. Your dad must be very used to this behavior if this was his reaction.

The one in your area might be a good one, and if it\u2019s not just go once and don\u2019t go back.", "NTA, you stood up for Fiona and your kid, the right thing to do.", "NTA She\u2019s grown. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t be an AH", "NTA go no or low contact with her, if she doesn't change she might say things that will hurt your kids or fill their head with lies about their bio mom which can also hurt them. If you do sit her down and explain why and that if she doesn't stop you will continue with the low or no contact", "NTA you were spot on with the monster comment. Time to go nc or at least lc. Your poor kids.", "NTA. Never go back. If you want to call check in or whatever fine. See how son is doing emotionally and go from there on what kind of relationship you will have with your mother.", "Sorry but who the hell gets so drunk at a party with young children that they start chasing said children around the backyard.\n\nNTA, and I think you should really rethink your relationship with your mother. Reading how she treats your SO and also your child is really concerning.", "NTA. Y T A if you apologize though. Your description was apt, she got drunk and terrorized a 7 year old.", "NTA & I would think more distance between y'all would be the best thing", "NTA", "NTA. Good on you for having Fiona's back right away. And I hate to break it to your father, but even if you speak to your mother again, there will definitely be no going back to \"normal\" after this.", "NTA\n\nPlease don't apologize.\n\nI've had too many people in my life (women in particular), including my mom get off easy and fail to apologize. This is one of those cases where if she doesn't have the sense to apologize, there isn't a relationship to be had. She's still in denial about your ex 5 years on. If she can't accept that by now, I don't know how shes expecting to have a relationship with her grandkids if she won't approve of their true mom (Fiona)", "NTA. Cut her from your life. Yes its tough bet the lack of drama will be heaven.", " NTA\u2026a breakdown?  I don\u2019t think so.  She was drunk.  A completely different scenario.  You have been with Fiona for three years.  Your mother is never going to accept her.  She treats you all like shit.  Why are you putting up with her toxic behavior?  Do you really want your children growing up around what you did?!  Go no contact or limit contact.  Be firm and set your boundaries and stick with them.  Your dad can enable your mom all he wants to, but you will no longer do so.", "You are NTA and I would never let her see your kids again. What kind of woman worships someone who cheated and abandoned her children. Protect your kids and Fiona", "Nta. \nYou may want to check out raisedbynarcissists. I think that reddit sub might help you.", "NTA \n\nDon't apologize! You have nothing to apologize for.  You were right.  And your father is a monster to demand it. \n\nYou might find help at Al-Anon. Good luck.", "NTA and I would cut off your mother from your family. You can't expose your kids to this kind of behavior.", "NTA. She was being unreasonable, rude, and toxic to you about your ex. I wouldn\u2019t interact with her anymore unless you had too, because she clearly prefers your ex over you. Also, what kind of grandmother cusses out her own 7 yr old grandson.", "NTA\nSure, you could\u2019ve taken a little of the edge off your language in the moment by saying \u2018you\u2019re being\u2019 or \u2018when you\u2019re drunk you are\u2019 instead of \u2018you are a fucking monster\u2019.  That\u2019s splitting hairs though, you expressed your point.\n\nShe was out of line first and the most.  It\u2019s on her to take the first step at mending fences.  That\u2019s when you walk back what you said if you feel it\u2019s right.  Don\u2019t go to her like you were the most in the wrong.", ">and everything to return to normal\n\nWhat normal?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You don't want to apologise for telling the truth? I think that's a pretty fucking fair call on your behalf.", "Since when is \"being a drunken asshole\" referred to as a \"mental breakdown?\"  That's a new one on me.  \n\nNTA, obviously.  You called it like you saw it.", "NTA, and don't apologize. Your mom has a problem, she needs help, not an enabler.", "Your mother was not having a breakdown.\n\nShe was a drunk terrorising a kid and Fiona stepped in to protect her child. Good for her.\n\nSome distance from your mother is no bad thing for everyone. Even if your dad is not happy.

That was a drunk having a tantrum because she didn't get her way with verbally abusing a child and getting scolded by the very woman that's not your ex. Again, that was not a mental breakdown, that was a temper tantrum, a drunken temper tantrum. If your mom can't handle her alcohol then she should drink and at that age, she would know if she could or not. You are so NTA. You were just brutally honest. At that moment in time, your son saw her as a monster coming after him and he was scared. Bravo for standing up for your son and your GF and bravo to your GF for stepping up for children that she didn't have to. And based on that encounter, she loves those children more than she has to.", "NTA but if you continue to expose your kids and gf to that woman that will quickly change. You have a choice, protect your family or capitulate to the woman who you say wants to control your life. DECIDE. Or you will very quickly find yourself single again.", "I never comment on these but NTA. If anything, I respect you so much and shout out for defending Fiona. You're a good man.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to get a fucking grip.\n\nIf it\u2019s a breakdown, it\u2019s over her being unable to control who you and your children love - that\u2019s her problem, not yours.\n\nHer behavior was completely inappropriate - from drunkenly chasing your son, to cursing him out, then ranting like a lunatic bringing up a fantasy narrative because she refuses to accept reality.\n\nThings can\u2019t return to normal, because even the normal is fucked up and unfair to you, to Fiona, and the boys.\n\nBecause she WILL try and turn them against you and Fiona when they are older. This rant was the warning sign of that.", "NTA, and it may be best not to have your kids around an alcoholic that can\u2019t control herself or her emotions.", "No good mother would abandon innocent children. Your ex wife is a monster. \n\nYour mother supporting a monster is therefore, a monster. \n\nyour logic is sound. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She is a monster.  She had a drunken tantrum and abused a child, then abused the only mother your children have ever really known in front of your kids.  You are right that you need to do what you have to to protect them, whatever you decide.", "NTA.. she wasn\u2019t having a breakdown.. she was abusively drunk.", "NTA your mom is toxic asl", "So let me get this. Your mom is drunk, scaring a kid and yelling at him. SO tells her not to yell at the kid, mom yells at SO even *more*, you yell at mom once, and now dad expects you to \"apologize first\"?\n\nIf you imagine a scale with each of you putting on weights mom's side is loaded and you have like one tiny thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Your Mom needs AA.\n\nYou might benefit from Al-Anon [https://al-anon.org/](https://al-anon.org/)", "NTA. Your Mum sounds like a busybody and an alcoholic, or at least a binge drinker. I\u2019m a grown woman of 42 and I\u2019d be scared! It doesn\u2019t sound like a breakdown. It sounds like she was drunk off her gourd and being verbally abusive to a child. Y\u2019all stepped in, and rightly so! Do not apologize to your Mum. Her behaviour is completely inappropriate.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a piece of work. Don\u2019t apologize for being right and calling her out", "NTA - but you will be if you continue to allow your mentally unstable alcoholic mother around your children.", "I mean, it sounds like a break down to me. But she only broke down because she's an asshole who's still in denial that she can't control her child's life like she's playing the Sims.", "Right, Op, you need to go NC with your Mom. Your kids do not need to have those memories, or such a toxic relationship in their lives. You suffered through it; but they don't need it to. Also, marry Fiona. Clearly she loves your kids and they seem to love her.  And then move. Release the toxicity from your life.", "A mean drunk having a tantrum. I hope OP doesn't let the kids be exposed to such toxic behavior again.", "And his dad for being a flying monkey for a mean drunk.", "I feel like people are missing the obvious (to me) sarcasm here.", "Found OP's father!", "I'm somewhat at a loss for words here. Does OP's dad see nothing wrong with an adult drunkenly chasing a child around until the child flees in terror to a safe adult?\n\nAfter that, it'd have to skew severely sideways for me to think OP could possibly be the AH.

Maybe he's the type who thinks abuse is fine and confronting the abuser about it is \"drama\"?", "Nope the father sounds like an enabling doormat, forever singing \"Sit Down, You'll Rock the Boat\".", "OPs dad is like far too many men.  He just wants it to be quiet.  He doesn't even care if there is actual peace, as long as no one is whining in his ear.  He will do or say anything, blame anyone except the wife he has continually allowed to bullrush everyone in her life without ever telling she was wrong, for every situation.  He simply doesn't care, as long as no one is whining or asking him to DO SOMETHING!  \n\nOP, you and your little family are absolutely NTA in any way.  It's time to put a stop to your mother seeing your STBW and your kids.  As long as your father allows this and actually supports her tantrums, she's going to keep throwing them, and it's always going to get worse.", "And OP's dad had explicitly stated beforehand that he would ensure there was no drama.\n\nYet when OP's mom starts causing drama, he doesn't try to stop it... and even puts the blame on OP.\n\nNTA but there are at least 2 in this story.", "\"Age quod agis.\"", "I agree, and perhaps even some enabling by requesting him to apologize even though his mother was clearly in the wrong.", "Yep the only sincere apology op can give is that he's sorry he spoke the truth.", "By \"no drama\" he meant \"your mom wants you there and it's easier for me if I convince you to come, so I'll just say whatever\"."]}
