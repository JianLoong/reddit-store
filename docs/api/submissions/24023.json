Not only would things be misspelled, I'd do a throwback to the days of l33t sp34k, I'd throw every hip teen abbreviation I could think of in there... I'd go off the rails.   \n\n\nI'm a pretty easy-going girl, fairly malleable, and just go with the flow...until someone pulls something like this, then it's watch out below!", "I hate texting for just this reason...I am very good at spelling and grammar, but I can't text well to save my life.", "How whaa~t? What kind of difficult? I'm sorry, I couldn't understand you over that EGREGIOUS typo.", "Exactly.", "The pa is the fact he didn\u2019t check with her when it was blatantly clear what her text meant. He could have done so many things to avoid the situation but didn\u2019t, that\u2019s passive aggressive. Weaponised incompetence. Call it what you want but who doesn\u2019t have the odd typo at times, she\u2019s human not a damn machine", "He didn't call because it was obvious.  There was no need to call her to clarify .  He just wanted to be an AH.  Petty man.", "The point I was trying to make to OP was that this is something that her husband has clearly communicated to her that it bothers him. She knows this. Yet she still does this. Without knowing the missing missing reasons we are all just jumping to conclusions on who\u2019s wrong and why. \n\nIf the husband made a post I wonder what it would sound like. Whenever I read an AITA post I always wonder what the other side of the story is, don\u2019t you?\n\nAnd if someone texted me to pick up \u201ccoconut mlik\u201d with no context I wouldn\u2019t know what the heck they actually wanted. But my family doesn\u2019t make curry. Does OP make it often enough that it\u2019s a staple? In which case why wouldn\u2019t they have some on hand? Or why wouldn\u2019t the husband know that\u2019s what was meant? \n\nMissing missing reasons matter and more information is needed. Not for us - OP and her husband need to talk more.", "In the version of OP I read, the two ingredients were spelled exactly the same.", "Everyone makes mistakes. In this case OP says s/he DOESN'T CARE. S/he knows it's important to his/her partner and doesn't care about that either. It's a long term ongoing problem and OP doesn't care. That makes him/her the AH.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Are you OP\u2019s husband?", "Lol, I think he meant 'It was', but yeeted the T", "I rmemeber taht psot from bcak tehn!", "Passive aggressive 100%", "Me three. I literally said out loud, \"Coconut is spelled the same way, WTF?\" Then, it still took a couple of seconds to get the milk spelling.", "Also in the 21st century we can instantly call or text the person to clarify anything we don\u2019t understand !!", "Typonese, I might have to steal that", "Lol.  Men don\u2019t ask for directions or help.", "I can count on at least one call from the store any time my wife goes alone. She wants so badly to make sure she\u2019s getting *exactly* the right thing. \u201cWhat color bell pepper was that? Is Y an ok substitute for Z?\u201d If she saw this typo on our shopping list, I know she\u2019d come home joking \u201cthey were out of coconut mlik, I hope coconut milk is ok\u201d.", "He\u2019d come home with coconut water despite the letters being milk. Lol", "Oh that makes sense I\u2019m just saying as OP husband being an adult he couldn\u2019t make that distinction? Especially with a word like milk. Doing that for kids or learning does not make sense.", "\ud83e\udd23", "And the lesson is, that he's an idiot for acting this way. \n\nThere is an entire thing about the letters in a word not needing to be in order except for the first and last letter, and our brains still being able to understand what's written. \n\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/word-jumble-meme-first-last-letters-cambridge-typoglycaemia", "Seriously.

And my dad is 75, and he understands modern technology just fine, thank you very much. (OK, I'll  admit my in-laws are the same age and are kind of clueless...)", "What more info could you possibly want then what OP has written?\n\nAgain, if someone asked you to get something from the shop and you don't know what it is, you ask them. You don't just skip it.

She literally misspelled it, the fact that you didn't even notice it is exactly why the only asshole here is the husband.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s edited, I think that\u2019s how small the error was and most brains autocorrect such differences. It\u2019s the whole Facebook post of words with the correct starting and ending letter but the rest jumbled and people can still read it. \n\nI believe the mistake was there, it was just so small you didn\u2019t notice. I think you should factor that into your judgement\u2026", "Do you understand sarcasm lol", "I know, I was just role playing as OPs husband for a minute there lol", "*Whoosh*", "I give it to you freely.  Although, full disclosure:  I nicked it myself.  Can't remember where from, sadly.", "As an adult he should be able to read and understand a simple spelling mistake. If I can decipher a what students have written without any of the correct letters surely he can do a four letter word with 2 letters switched around.", "She had the whole day to just make dinner. She could\u2019ve popped up to the store to get the milk. Why is the only one who was at work all day the only asshole?", "I got what you were going for.
