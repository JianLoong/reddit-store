Is he your school teacher to treat you like a child in this way?\n\nAbsolutely no way in hell I would put up with that behaviour. Who does he think he is? Clearly you've let him get away with this for a very long time, and that's on you. I suggest you stop.\n\nAnd if you haven't had kids yet, think hard on what kind of father he would be to tear his kids down in the same way he does you over something as insignificant as a typing error in a text message.\n\nNTA\n\nYou really deserve better.", "Jeez. It actually took me like 3 slooow readings of your typo to see it - because human brains are *wired* to ignore typos that do not affect the meaning of the word.\n\nSo you\u2019re definitely NTA, your husband 100% is. He did a petty thing for a petty reason, wanted to \u201cteach you a lesson\u201d most likely. And it backfired in the best possible way.", "NTA. I can't say the same thing about the husband. Good for you for putting being in charge of the dinner on him. That was an intentional asshole move. Anyone with a bare minimum education can understand mlik is supposed to be milk and if you are just canning the list you eyes auto read it is milk. Kudos to you.", "What a petty jackass.

If he was really confused he could have asked. I bet he was being petty on purpose and love that you rightly gave him the dinner responsibly instead!", "Your husband was being a controlling ass on purpose. He knew exactly what you meant. Any rational adult human would. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. NTA. Man he sure is a petty thing isn't he. How do you tolerate that nonsense I have no patience for that sort of game playing idiocy.", "NTA. He ruined dinner, not you, as it sounds very deliberate on his end.\n\nI love the poetry in that he ended up shooting himself in the foot with his petty assholery.

Any decent husband would have either called you to clarify while he was at the store or run out to get coconut milk once he came home and found out it was necessary for tonight\u2019s dinner.\n\nHe seems like kind of a pretentious jerk and I hope this isn\u2019t indicative of his personality in general.", "NTA. It frustrates me when people write illiterate texts and tell you that's \"it's ok it's just a text\", but this was obviously a typo, not what I would even call a spelling mistake.

Others should not have to decipher what you mean especially during a time crunch. Why don't you take responsibility when conveying a critical dinner item to your spouse?

That is infantile and pedantic.  Your husband sounds exhausting. \n\nStart making your shopping lists with visuals. \n\nGet product images online and send them attached to the messages.\n\nIf you're going to do a written one, clip pictures from magazines or store circulars and paste them in place.\n\nGo so far as to drop map pins to the store where items need to be bought.
