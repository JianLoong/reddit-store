I told him I\u2019d rather he didn\u2019t with it being my birthday and the day I was supposed to have my much needed break. He said okay so I thought that was that. \n\nThen an hour later he said he had two jobs scheduled for that day and he needed to leave in 30 minutes. So I didn\u2019t get my break on my birthday. \n\nHe did tell me he\u2019d make up for it this past Friday by taking the kids out all day. \n\nFriday comes and he decides to schedule two more jobs so I still don\u2019t get my break. The plan turned into today, Tuesday. He had a \u2018last minute emergency job\u2019 come up today and couldn\u2019t give me my break. \n\nHe didn\u2019t work any other day last week. Only on the days he had promised me. \n\nI told him this has really upset me because I really needed a break- and still do- and that was the only thing I asked for for my birthday. He told me I\u2019m being ungrateful because he got me flowers on my birthday and he didn\u2019t have to do that and he\u2019ll give me my break this week. I told him how tf can I believe he\u2019ll actually give me a break when the past three times he\u2019s promised it he bailed last second. \n\nNow he\u2019s mad at me and isn\u2019t wanting to speak. \n\nAm I being an asshole for being upset I didn\u2019t get my birthday wish?", "created_utc": 1669166892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2bhno/aita_for_being_upset_he_couldnt_give_me_what_i/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
