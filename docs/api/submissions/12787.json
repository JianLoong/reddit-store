I understand your feelings, the new wife is enjoying the affection and attention of your ex like you wanted but he denied you.

This woman may be a wonderful woman who is kind, giving, intelligent, funny, thoughtful, etc. Etc. Judging her because she shows skin is a short sighted, outdated view on how society views women. Unless you want to teach your daughter that her value is only determined by her physical body and what she does with, I suggest you take a moment to self reflect about why you feel women in these careers are too indecemt to exist. \n\nWomen are more than just their bodies, even the ones that make an income showing their body. When you judge women for things like this you are devaluing them as a human, that they are undeserving of being treated fairly or kindly. This is actually just sending a bigger message to other women that they better act right and cover up or they are worthless too.\n\nI would be careful OP, because you may not like to hear it but you dont know what kind of woman your daughter will want to be as she grows. You should want her to know she is valued no matter how she dresses, or what jobs she works. That no one ever has the right to treat her like she doesnt matter because of her choices.
