I\u2019ve decided to end the relationship and will tell him this afternoon. This made me realize how resentful and unhappy I am with him and that is unlikely to change. To those who say he probably has depression, he may he has never communicated it but yes it could be the reason. But even if he does I doubt just by knowing it will fix my resentment.

Some people take a longer time to process things and men don't always share their struggles with others. They tend to keep a lot to themselves.

He said the only way he could do it and still feel like a \"man\" was to make it his profession. So he learned how to make nutritious meals from youtube, made babyfood, kept the house freaking spotless, had a schedule for an educational or bonding activity outside the house to do with the kids every day, it was crazy. He did Daddy and me groups, the works. My friend, his wife, got home at 630 to dinner, bathed and fed kids, and a clean house.

I\u2019m now questioning if he just thought being a SAHD was the road to an easy life for him because he clearly doesn\u2019t enjoy cooking or cleaning. Plus kids? I feel like it would be similar to being a single mother.", "He might, he mostly pays video games all day. But he has $1800 from unemployment he gets and I pay all the rent, utilities and food. He can get help if he needs it and he might also get depression with kids. Is he going to drop everything and expect me to deal with everything? \n\nI will just say I did most of the cooking and cleaning before he was laid off and now I\u2019m still doing most of the cooking and cleaning so that hasn\u2019t changed.

Many people attach pride and identity to their employment. Even if they didn\u2019t love the work, being laid off can be devastating. I might consider if any of his behaviors are new since being laid off or have always been there.", "Yeah, he's just looking for an excuse to be unemployed.  And I think that you know you would end up picking up the majority of the household and childcare responsibilities.  Take a very hard look at  this relationship.", "Of course you\u2019re correct here, he can do it and it\u2019s plainly evident he just doesn\u2019t want to.

Find someone who deserves you.", "If you add kids to the mix, it would be worse than being a single mother with the way he\u2019s acting now. At least if you didn\u2019t have him leaching off of you, you\u2019d only have to clean up and care for the kiddos after work. With him there not only is he creating more of a mess, but any task you give him would be met with pushback and would ultimately become much more of a headache than just doing it yourself. He\u2019d just be an extra child to raise and care for if you were to have him be a SAHD. Sounds like he\u2019s not interested in pulling his own weight in general whether that be not wanting to work or not wanting to care for the house, and he\u2019s shown you that he can\u2019t handle any form of pressure or constructive feedback. His ability to be a dad in general, and a stay at home dad at that does not look very promising. You may want to think through a little more if this is what you want your future to look like. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s willing to do what\u2019s necessary to actually be an equal partner in your life together and the imbalance would only worsen with kids.", "If you\u2019re really invested here\u2026\n\nIt is time for you to sit down with him, explain that you are seeing him struggle, but you can\u2019t do more than you already are. He has gotta get an appointment if this is deeper than you can actually be part of helping him with. \n\nHe\u2019s probably embarrassed and unwilling to be honest and vulnerable. Listen to him, ask him to explain or clarify things and try not to invalidate or be unkind. \n\nTogether, write out the tasks like a weekly chore chart and establish mutual expectations. \n\nHe also needs to be stashing in savings as much of his UI as possible. It\u2019s the responsible thing to do anyway. and I\u2019d keep this to yourself: but if this happens to fall apart, he\u2019s got the money to leave.", "It seems a lot of anger and resentment has built up towards your partner, and I'm not blaming you for anything, so please don't take it that way. People don't choose to get depressed and anxious, and it can be a lethal combination, so that's why I asked if he is experiencing this. \n\nIt seems you expected certain things from him, and due to not getting it, you're very angry. It also seems you don't feel it is fair to work 50 hours a week or be the sole bread winner unless he is pulling his weight, so is it possible to reduce these hours so you can have some time for yourself?\n\nI agree that it is unfair, and a lot of conversations need to be had to set your expectations and goals (I'd say couples therapy is the best thing so you both have a safe space to share how you feel without it leading to a fight). \n\nAs for men processing and dealing differently, there is a lot of information and literature that talks about this depending on the cultural background. I don't know your situation fully, so I didn't want to assume anything, and I'm sorry for hurting you.\n\nFrom personal experience, relationships are almost never equal. There will be days when someone has to give more, and some days less. It is frustrating and difficult, though, and I'm sorry you are experiencing so much hurt.", "Girl, RUN. If you have kids with this guy you're going to be the sole earner, and still stuck doing all the cooking, cleaning and childcare. Even if he manages to get a job and keep it (unlikely!) he's going to make you do all the cooking, cleaning and childcare. While you continue to pay most of everything. He's getting nearly 2k a month right now and contributes NOTHING to the household? Oh, honey, no. Why are you even considering starting a family with this guy?!\n\nIf he has depression then he needs to be trying to get help, which he's not. I don't care if he has mental health issues, he is COMPLETELY taking advantage of you and has no interest in changing that.\n\nWe see far too many women on Reddit posting about their deadbeat boyfriends and husbands who stay at home and do NOTHING. Don't end up like them, stuck wasting years of their life living like a single mother with a grown-ass man they're also stuck taking care of on top of everything else.", "Absolutely possible, then he needs to seek mental health resources which he has the money for since he gets $1800 from unemployment. Which he has not done and just plays video games all day. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m skeptical is because he didn\u2019t do any housework or cook before this and he didn\u2019t during his laid off period. He spent a lot of time paying video games before this and during it as well. Maybe it\u2019s depression but his basic behavior hasn\u2019t changed", "Thanks actually you have hit the nail on the head I\u2019m very resentful for the last 7 months. I have been thinking of breaking up for at least 5 months now and it\u2019s just that we have been dating for 5 years that\u2019s stopped me. The truth is I have no idea how he will be if we have children. But I can\u2019t discount what I\u2019ve seen these months otherwise I\u2019d really be kicking myself if I do and realize this is just his normal state. He might be depressed but even knowing that isn\u2019t going to get rid of my resentment. Don\u2019t expect people to change is a golden rule and I can only go off of what I\u2019ve seen. So yes I think it\u2019s time I tell him and let this end on more friendly terms than it likely will if we continue", "That's understandable. Your resentment sounds like a deep seated grief over not being provided for, which is a normal expectation in a relationship. I'm very sorry that you feel so tired, frustrated, and alone in your relationship. 5 years is a long time, and it seems like you know what you want and need to do for yourself. I hope that you find healing as this has taken a toll on you."]}
