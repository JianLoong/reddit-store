I\u2019ve decided to end the relationship and will tell him this afternoon. This made me realize how resentful and unhappy I am with him and that is unlikely to change.

With him there not only is he creating more of a mess, but any task you give him would be met with pushback and would ultimately become much more of a headache than just doing it yourself. He\u2019d just be an extra child to raise and care for if you were to have him be a SAHD. Sounds like he\u2019s not interested in pulling his own weight in general whether that be not wanting to work or not wanting to care for the house, and he\u2019s shown you that he can\u2019t handle any form of pressure or constructive feedback. His ability to be a dad in general, and a stay at home dad at that does not look very promising. You may want to think through a little more if this is what you want your future to look like.

He has gotta get an appointment if this is deeper than you can actually be part of helping him with. \n\nHe\u2019s probably embarrassed and unwilling to be honest and vulnerable. Listen to him, ask him to explain or clarify things and try not to invalidate or be unkind. \n\nTogether, write out the tasks like a weekly chore chart and establish mutual expectations. \n\nHe also needs to be stashing in savings as much of his UI as possible. It\u2019s the responsible thing to do anyway. and I\u2019d keep this to yourself: but if this happens to fall apart, he\u2019s got the money to leave.", "It seems a lot of anger and resentment has built up towards your partner, and I'm not blaming you for anything, so please don't take it that way. People don't choose to get depressed and anxious, and it can be a lethal combination, so that's why I asked if he is experiencing this. \n\nIt seems you expected certain things from him, and due to not getting it, you're very angry. It also seems you don't feel it is fair to work 50 hours a week or be the sole bread winner unless he is pulling his weight, so is it possible to reduce these hours so you can have some time for yourself?\n\nI agree that it is unfair, and a lot of conversations need to be had to set your expectations and goals (I'd say couples therapy is the best thing so you both have a safe space to share how you feel without it leading to a fight). \n\nAs for men processing and dealing differently, there is a lot of information and literature that talks about this depending on the cultural background. I don't know your situation fully, so I didn't want to assume anything, and I'm sorry for hurting you.\n\nFrom personal experience, relationships are almost never equal. There will be days when someone has to give more, and some days less. It is frustrating and difficult, though, and I'm sorry you are experiencing so much hurt.", "Girl, RUN. If you have kids with this guy you're going to be the sole earner, and still stuck doing all the cooking, cleaning and childcare.

He's getting nearly 2k a month right now and contributes NOTHING to the household? Oh, honey, no. Why are you even considering starting a family with this guy?!\n\nIf he has depression then he needs to be trying to get help, which he's not. I don't care if he has mental health issues, he is COMPLETELY taking advantage of you and has no interest in changing that.\n\nWe see far too many women on Reddit posting about their deadbeat boyfriends and husbands who stay at home and do NOTHING. Don't end up like them, stuck wasting years of their life living like a single mother with a grown-ass man they're also stuck taking care of on top of everything else.", "Absolutely possible, then he needs to seek mental health resources which he has the money for since he gets $1800 from unemployment. Which he has not done and just plays video games all day. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m skeptical is because he didn\u2019t do any housework or cook before this and he didn\u2019t during his laid off period. He spent a lot of time paying video games before this and during it as well. Maybe it\u2019s depression but his basic behavior hasn\u2019t changed", "Thanks actually you have hit the nail on the head I\u2019m very resentful for the last 7 months. I have been thinking of breaking up for at least 5 months now and it\u2019s just that we have been dating for 5 years that\u2019s stopped me. The truth is I have no idea how he will be if we have children. But I can\u2019t discount what I\u2019ve seen these months otherwise I\u2019d really be kicking myself if I do and realize this is just his normal state. He might be depressed but even knowing that isn\u2019t going to get rid of my resentment. Don\u2019t expect people to change is a golden rule and I can only go off of what I\u2019ve seen. So yes I think it\u2019s time I tell him and let this end on more friendly terms than it likely will if we continue", "That's understandable. Your resentment sounds like a deep seated grief over not being provided for, which is a normal expectation in a relationship.

In a previous relationship my ex and I talked about the possibility of him being a stay at home dad if we ever had kids. But the thing is that even while we were both working he cleaned frequently, did his own laundry, cooked regularly, and even had a side hustle he planned on ramping up if he could around child care. And I told him I was generally ok with that because I knew I could rely on him to do everything around the house and save us significant money that way and that the kids would be well taken care of.  If he's not going to do his share of the work while you're both employed I wouldn't trust him to take on an even larger share when he's not.", "Depression is treatable 80% of the time. \n\nDude is a moocher and fully wants to be one.

I would come home to him sleeping, our young kids doing whatever they wanted, usually in front of the TV, the house a disaster. I would change my clothes and cry on my way to my second job because I couldn't be there taking care of my home and my kids because I was too busy holding everything together, while he did nothing. I begged him to get a job, to go back to school,  to see a doctor, to do literally anything, but no, nothing ever changed. Oh, he would apply for jobs here and there, and if he got hired, he would go for a couple of days and then say it didn't work, rinse, and repeat. I was overwhelmed, overworked, and coming apart at the seams. \n\n I finally reached out to talk to a counselor myself and as I was describing things and how hard everything was and how I couldn't cope any more, she stopped me and said \"oh he sounds depressed,  you just need to be more mentally though, and encourage him to get seen by a doctor and talk to someone\" She dismissed me and my suffering because \"he sounds like he has depression\".  I was at a point where I was thinking of hurting myself and I was there reaching out for help and all she cared about was him and how he might have depression and literally told me to toughen up. \n\nYour attitude is toxic. The belief that leaving a relationship that's not good for you is a horrible thing to do because the other person has a mental illness they won't get treated for can be lethal. I spent years practically killing myself, coming very close to actually hurting myself because of that exact mentality. I felt so guilty for contemplating ending my marriage because it's supposed to be for better or worse, right, but why is it him who's always worse and me who always has to be better?", "Applying for jobs (*actually doing it*) can be very stressful with the lack of responses (it's bad where I am, I know well-overqualified folks who don't even get a \"no\" email ).

You don't really know someone until you deal with something at least a little hard together. He proved he's useless and maybe even a burden.", "Fantastic analogy.", "I hope you don't take this the wrong way but how did you manage to stay with him for 5 yrs and consider having kids with him if even before you were doing most of the housework plus earning more? Don't do that to yourself.", "Please let us know how the conversation goes. Will you be the one moving out or him?", "I really, really personally understand and feel your bf\u2019s plight, but depression or laziness or job loss is an explanation, not an excuse. \n\nHe should have been doing those chores Day One. He should have improved *immediately* after you two talked about this. If he actually really cared and respected you, he would have put in the effort. It\u2019s been 7 months, or 210 days and the only thing he\u2019s proven is that he would not be able to be a homemaker. \u2026Like everyone else, I say you ditch him.", "5 yrs in the past is nothing compared to a most probably shtty future with that guy.
