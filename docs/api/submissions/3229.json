But I just think it's actually normal for a 16 yr old to do that. We all did that at that age and we all got that when we were younger. It wasn't traumatising. BUT, we didn't respond the way your adopted daughter has. I think your neice went too far. But it is something she is used to and she probably thinks it's normal so because she is still a child, it's worth having a chat with her to ask her why she was so happy to frighten someone else that much and that maybe she was enjoying it a little too much and not caring about her little cousin enough. I would suggest cutting her off for a little while depending on her reaction. Then maybe re introduce them later on. It's best not to try separating relations and friends because it can make them more determined to meet up , even years later.

And - of course by all means - have a stern talk with your family members again and maybe don\u2019t leave the 16 years old unsupervised with her for a while, but don\u2019t go the nuclear option of cutting anyone off that potentially causes more damage than the story did.", "NTA.

It is true that teens are famously impulsive and are prone to a lot of acting first and thinking about it later.  Poor judgement is nearly a hallmark of the teen years.  However, by age 8 most children are already fairly clear on the difference between right and wrong.  By 16, the sister should know this was wrong.  \n\nOne could try to make a case for this being an impulsive action, although the smaller child appears to have been terrorized pretty methodically and with a level of pre-planning.  The sister also thinks it \"hilarious\" that the smaller child is now wetting herself, and that lack of empathy is not normal in any way, shape, or form.\n\nI can certainly agree that the sister's mother needs to take some action in disciplining her daughter and letting her know this won't be tolerated.  \n\nAt any rate, I think OP is wise to not allow her daughter around the sister until aome sort of apology is forthcoming.", "That's plausible. As an adult, I just assumed my parents looked around the room for something commonplace so it would be easy for me to find what I needed to overcome my fear.", "Oh I absolutely agree with you.

It was abusive.", "So locking up a 7 yr old *already traumatised* kid, scaring her with bloody mary stories to the point she is now soiling her pants and can't sleep, is **hillarious and harmless**, according to OP's mom and sister? \n\nBUT telling off a 16 year old for doing so, and saying she'll be kept away from her niece,  THAT is where they draw the line?", "I agree with you, but OP has had her in her care for 4 years, not since she was four (she most likely was 3 when adopted).", "Her sister is 2 years away from being an adult, she is not some little kid that still doesn\u2019t know right from wrong. And her niece isn\u2019t just a regular kid, but had to be removed from her parents care to the point they lost their parental rights. She had a very traumatic first 3 years of life and of course she is going to react differently in cruel acts like what her younger Aunt did to her.", "She is not just a normal kid, but had to be removed from her parents care and had their rights terminated to be adopted by OP. Guarantee that little girl probably faced some pretty severe trauma from her first three years of life and her trauma response is going to be different. A good reason to keep her away is because she thought it was a good idea to traumatize a already hurt kid.", "We made \"good dreams, go away monsters\" spray. It was water with a few drops of lavender oil! Couple spritzes on the kiddos pillow and one on their favorite stuffed animal. Worked great!", "I did that for my younger son who was terrified of ghosts. It was a huge help.", "Awarded on your behalf.  Happy Holidays!", "There are situations where I could see a 16 yr old making a stupid impuls decissions without them intending to be malicious. \n\nBut they'd feel aweful about it afterwards\n\nThe truly scary part is the complete lack of emphathy, laughing about it, and excusing that behaviour, after being told what effect it had on the little girl", "Hell, I'm 60 and it's way too scary for me!", "NTA I completely agree NC is a must", "NTA, your kid comes first.  I\u2019d lose my ever loving shit if someone did that to one of my kids and 16 is definitely old enough to know better.", "NTA. You did the right thing and would be an asshole if you let your sister get away with this", "NTA. She terrified a little kid, who is now suffering trauma because of her \"just a prank.\" Protect the child from these horrible people.", "NTA... this little girl us traumatised. I hope everything gets better.", "NTA\nAt 16, you know what bullying is. I'm sure a bit of googling will find you a \"spell\" to get rid of spirits and you can help you daughter move past this incident. Your family are awful people.", "NTA.", "NTA. My cousin, albeit the same age as me at the time did something similar and mirrors and the time 3am (the haunting hour or whatever) still give me the heebie jeebies", "Nta. That \u2018prank\u2019 was cruel and traumatised your niece. She *shouldn\u2019t* be allowed near her again, especially while she\u2019s insisting the results of the prank were funny. \n\nMaybe tell your niece that bloody Mary\u2019s weakness is her own reflection. Or you could grab a Victorian hand mirror off of Amazon (they\u2019re around \u00a310 and look really fancy) and tell her it\u2019s a special item to ward her off.", "NTA. That's not a prank. That's straight up evil. Please protect your neice from these people.", "Math is not my strongest suit, lol."]}
