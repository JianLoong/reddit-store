But that's not a reason to take it lightly and let it go, it's the reason she should be kept away or at least not left alone with your niece until she genuinely shows contrition, and matures beyond that kind of behavior.", "NTA. Wow. Team up? To defend traumatizing a kid? I\u2019m glad you have someone with you (dad). Your sister is old enough to know better. The action was malicious, and so was her response. You have EVERY RIGHT to keep your child away from her.", "NTA, to put it plainly, this teenager bullied your your child. Your mother is saying that because she is an older adult than you, you are not allowed to set up boundaries.\n\nIt sounds like you should cut the contact even longer and it should absolutely include your mother since not only does she think she does not need to treat you with respect, but that you should not protect your child against your younger sister since your younger sister is Her child. It's a hierarchy issue that harms your kid.", "NTA, your daughter is your number one priority and your mom and sister are honestly being total b1+ches. You don't scare a child like that and it falls within the realms of child abuse. Get the poor thing to a child therapist who would be able to help her better as kids doesn't understand adult logic. Also unless there's a full apology, dont let your sister anywhere near your daughter and do the same for your mom as she needs to know the difference between a prank and scarring someone for life. And if you can send the boogeyman to pay a visit to your sister and see if she sees the humour when she starts wetting her bed.", "If you have adopted this girl. Why are you calling her your niece and putting \u201cparent\u201d in quotes?", "NTA. Your sister is a bully.", "YTA sorry I don't actually think you are an asshole. But I just think it's actually normal for a 16 yr old to do that. We all did that at that age and we all got that when we were younger. It wasn't traumatising. BUT, we didn't respond the way your adopted daughter has. I think your neice went too far. But it is something she is used to and she probably thinks it's normal so because she is still a child, it's worth having a chat with her to ask her why she was so happy to frighten someone else that much and that maybe she was enjoying it a little too much and not caring about her little cousin enough. I would suggest cutting her off for a little while depending on her reaction. Then maybe re introduce them later on. It's best not to try separating relations and friends because it can make them more determined to meet up , even years later. Best of luck, I'm glad you care about your adopted neice/daughter so much.\n\nX", "Nta. The 16 is old enough to know better. Your parents ate ah.", "NTA, well well well, if it isn't the consequences of their own actions - sounds like they haven't faced many of those before. \n\nOf course, as a responsible mother, you aren't going to allow your tiny vulnerable child around people who think it's funny to torment them. Do not give it a second thought, beyond repeating that every time they accost you.", "Your sister is a vile human who is unable to act appropriately around small children. Therefore she doesn't get to be around your small child. Cause and effect.\n\nNTA", "Your sister has no remorse and thought it was funny until you forbade her. She can do a similar thing without thinking for a second. You should not permit her to see your niece for a very very long time.", "NTA. I would NEVER allow her around your daughter again! Poor little lady, protect her with everything you have.", "NTA your 16-year-old sister is plenty old enough to learn that actions have consequences. You should keep your niece away from her for as long as you feel it\u2019s needed.", "*Tell her that if Bloody Mary sees her own reflection, she will disappear*.\n\nThis is such a clever response.\n\nTell her that you looked it up online, OP, and that all of the websites recommend this.  \n\nIt may be that you need to mention this to her therapist or social worker, too.  If she doesn't already have a therapist she may need one for this, and for whatever happened before you got guardianship.\n\nYour sister is a piece of work, and so is your mother.  It sounds like sister is jealous of the attention given to her little cousin, and I wonder if your mother is annoyed that you were the one to get custody of the child.\n\nNTA", "A 16 year old is darn well aware of how bad this was after hearing the end results and should have responded with an apologetic demeanor not by doubling down. Where is the empathy? Nope. NTA", "And definitely a break from your mother since your mother does not sound like she cares about the safety of your kid", "Because I am her legal parent. But she calls me auntie still. I love her like my daughter, but she\u2019s always called me auntie so we continued it as auntie and niece :) whatever\u2019s more comfortable for her.", "She's 16 not 6. She knew full well that this sort of thing could scare a little kid. She's well old enough to know right and wrong. \n\nJust because it didn't scare her when she was that young doesn't mean. The niece would be the sa.e way.\n\nClearly she thought it was no big deal when confronted. She showed no remorse. That is a major issue. Her mother is enabling it too which is wrong. \n\nLocking a 7yr old in a dark room after telling her a creepy woman is going to show up to take her/hurt her is extremely traumatizing for a child. And clearly the 16yr old is old enough to understand that the niece has been through a lot and is not a target for pranks.\n\nAnd she did confront the niece. Niece didn't care. That's enough to cut contract for a decent time.", "NTA -  Your sister isn\u2019t a child she\u2019s 16. She\u2019s a bully and knew better. Good for you for protecting your child", "NTA\n\nYour sister is old enough to know better or at least understand why what she did was f-cked up.\n\nAs for your daughter/niece, I suggest you do a ritual to rid your home of Bloody Mary with your niece joining in. Something simple like fill a spray with water with a few drops of food colouring and tell her it's a potion and join her in spraying away Bloody Mary.\n\nI also recommend a child therapist, just to cover your bases.", "NTA! \n\nThis is no prank. It's not okay in any way to scare a kid to this extent. You are the adoptive parent, thus THE parent. Your decision. You're doing so well. Don't doubt yourself.", "Your sister is 16, not a child.  She knew what she was doing.  She did this to Torture a 7 year old.  \n\nYour mother, an AH, for enabling.  \n\nYou....NTA", "NTA, but to be honest: you talk about the child having been \u201ctraumatized\u201d by the ghost story (as a mental health professional I always internally cringe at how much that phrase is being overused by non-professionals, but that\u2019s a different story).\n\nIn reality by cutting her off now from that part of her/your family for the sister telling her a ghost story you a) will likely cause her *actual* trauma, because especially for a child that likely already has experienced some attachment issues due to the adoption now having even more members of her family who she is probably attached to being cut off can be more damaging than anything else, and b) ironically you will very likely not even accomplish what you are trying to accomplish and shield her from those kind of ghost stories; I myself ironically learned about Bloody Mary the first time from my own kiddo, when he was only very little older than your daughter, who himself had heard about it from his little friends (and apparently done the turning off the lights thing in the bathroom with them) in school.\n\nI think a much better, more practical and ultimately more healthy approach is working with her on how to better differentiate between truth and story (be it a movie or a story that someone tells her), teach her coping skills on how to deal with anxiety, and consider getting her into counseling. And - of course by all means - have a stern talk with your family members again and maybe don\u2019t leave the 16 years old unsupervised with her for a while, but don\u2019t go the nuclear option of cutting anyone off that potentially causes more damage than the story did.", "NTA. Your mother and sister are. Your neice could probably use some therapy", "That's very clever! I didn't learn about Bloody Mary until I was older, but I was afraid of monsters in the closet and under the bed. My dad would make me \"monster spray\".(air freshener with a new label he'd printed) I could spray it to keep away the monsters, but only two bursts a night. Worked like a charm. :)", "NTA at all. You are trying to help that child not have trauma for the rest of their life and your sister thinks it's funny. Please never leave her alone with your sister for a long time.", "NTA. When I was 16 years old I knew better than to traumatize children.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I\u2019m calling complete BS on your mother saying your sister is still a kid too and doesn\u2019t understand. She\u2019s 16, yes still a kid, but she knew damn well what she was doing and finds it hilarious that your niece is so traumatised. That\u2019s disturbing.", "NTA \n\nTIL I was actually traumatized at a young age and not weird for being more terrified of this than my older siblings \ud83d\ude48", "NTA\n\nA 16yo knows better than to traumatize a child. And then to laugh when it is explained, simply reveals a malicious and abusive mindset.\n\nI would keep the child away from the sister for as long as possible, perhaps for the next 11 years.", "NTA. My cousin made \"monster spray\" for her son and told him that one spray would scare monsters away forever. He isn't scared anymore.", "Ummm NTA NTA NTA but your sister is a massive one", "I wish i could give you an award.
