If she wanted one so bad she would ask your mother or buy one herself.", "Well calling your sister a bitch probably isn't the best move, but hey.. siblings.   \n\n\nI would recommend a heating pad or wearing warmer pajamas to bed.

If you and sister are old enough to have jobs and be semi-independent while living at home, sister is the asshole. If you're both young enough that your mom is responsible for your well-being, AH is split between sister and mom- sister for lying about you stealing it, and mom for not getting sister enough blankets so this argument could have been a non-issue in the first place.", "Warm drink or hot shower st bedtime, flannel sheets and pajamas, wool socks, hot water bottle.

Yes, siblings can be annoying but there is no need to call her a b*tch just because of a blanket.\nI wonder what the reason is why she is always cold. Maybe you could ask her (nicely!) why she needs so many blankets, there may be a deeper reason for that kind of behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister is a liar and a pest.  Your mom needs to provide your sister with enough blankets or heat to sleep.  You need to stand up for yourself without resorting to cursing and personal attacks.\n\nIf your sister\u2019s bedroom is so cold that she can\u2019t sleep even with 4 blankets, then that\u2019s a problem.  Ask your parents to seal the drafty windows with a shrink film insulation kit, and purchase a safe electric space heater.  There are solutions that do not involve pilfering your comforter.", "Yes, I do feel bad but she\u2019s been constantly rude and needy about it. I get annoyed very easily when she asks for it when she has more than 4 on her bed. it doesn\u2019t makes sense but I told her she can ask for a new comforter for Christmas. But she continued to argue so I went in a different room to avoid her.", "Her room is not cold. There\u2019s a gas stove the heats our house a few feet away from her bedroom. She just gets cold due to her body temperatures. Due to the lack of the asking over and over again just made me break out. I asked my parents to please get her a big blanket so she would leave me alone but they just ignored me. Yes I do take responsibility for calling her a bitch but she needs to learn when I say \u201cno\u201d won\u2019t mean I\u2019ll say \u201cyes\u201d a few weeks later and she doesn\u2019t always get things her way.", "Perhaps an electric blanket would be good for her if 4 blankets aren't enough.", "Is there something about *that* blanket that means so much to her?

She really like the texture of it but it\u2019s mine not hers. Even when I let her use it for a night, she\u2019s still a jerk about it. So I don\u2019t let her anymore. But no, it doesn\u2019t mean anything really to her. She just wants another blanket on her bed. Especially since mine is big.", "That would be a great idea but I already got her a expensive gift before this happened. I\u2019ll tell her she should add that to her Christmas wishlist!", "But you said it was an extra from the house closet? I'm not saying you are the AH but you said it is just an extra and your responses sound like the only reason you won't let her have it is because she is annoying and \"it is mine\". Like you are just holding it over her head for no real reason. Just imagine if you gave it to her she would be so happy and surprised, and you would feel very good about yourself.\n\nETA: One of my kids wanted ALL the blankets layered one on top of another on his bed. He probably had 5 at one point. Even in summer. It just made him happy. I could have put my foot down and said \"no, that is dumb and wrong\" (because that IS my opinion) but its such a minor thing to make him happy. Now he doesn't care about having a zillion blankets. But he does something else that drives me crazy: He'll take a bath or shower, get ready for bed and wear FULL clothes--not pajama pants but regular pants (not jeans because he won't wear and doesn't own jeans) to bed. My whole life-even when it was just me and husband and no kids I have said \"NO PANTS IN BED\". it's just a rule I have! pajamas are ok, but pants (esp jeans) in bed? the thought grosses me out and I don't have a reason why. My first kid went right along with my rule, never questioned it. If he fell asleep with pants on as a little kid, I would take them off of him. No. Pants. In. Bed. The younger one-(he's 14) pretty much goes out of his way to wear actual pants and I say something every day and we all laugh at each other. It's lighthearted. It **does** really bother me BUT he is his own person and I \"let\" him do it because it lets him exercise his free will without really hurting anyone. ETA\\*\\* this is more important to me than my grossed out feeling about the pants in the bed.\n\nAll that to say: Maybe giving her the blanket would mean a great deal to her for reasons you don't have to understand. And you don't have to spend your energy being annoyed by her. Like, change your perspective and remember its not a requirement to be so irritated with your sister \"just because\"\n\nETA He doesn't own or wear jeans because he refuses them, not because I won't let him. I have tried to buy him jeans, he hates them.", "It was my parents old comforter until they got a new one. 2 years ago I was redoing my bedroom and my family keeps extra blankets in the closet. My old comforter was stained and old so I asked my parents if I could have it since they don\u2019t use it and they said yes. It\u2019s my only blanket. I\u2019m not going to give it to my sister. It\u2019s the only one the suits my room and is comfortable for me cause I have anxiety. If she\u2019s cold, there\u2019s plenty of blankets in the closet that fits her room and is comfortable in my opinion.
