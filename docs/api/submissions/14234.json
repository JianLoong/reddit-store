I examined it and found that 2 of the stem ends were completely chewed off. I started sobbing and off we went to the emergency vet with 2/3 of our cats who we suspected to have eaten the lily (the 3rd was not in its vicinity as she is a feral rescue and only occupies certain parts of the house). \n\nWhen we got there we were informed that this was a life threatening situation, as suspected. The suggested course of action was induced vomiting, meds, and IV fluids for 48 hours. The price? ~$3000 to be paid upon discharge. This is a really overwhelming amount of money esp in current times, but absolutely anything to save our cats. \n\nMy husband and I have separate finances. We have a joint credit card that we use for things like groceries and furniture, which we both pay off monthly by contributing equal amounts (ie splitting the bill). They do take credit card payment at this vet which will result in less of an immediate hit to both of our finances thank god, but a big part of me thinks my husband should pay off this bill in its entirety. After we got home from the vet I brought this up to him and he was resistant, saying he did not know, it\u2019s not fair, etc. \n\nAITA for suggesting that he pay the $3k? The other alternative would be that we each pay $1.5k, given the separate finances, but I am having trouble coming to terms with this option given that I had no part in allowing this plant into the house and letting the cats ingest it. I was fully aware of lily toxicity and cats, but was not home to stop this from happening - it went on behind my back. Had I not discovered it when I came home, our cats would be dead.

So, AITA?\n\nMore context: both my husband and I work full time and have well-paying jobs. He makes $15k more than me per year, if that matters.

It was a really unfortunate mistake, but the point of a marriage is to be a partnership. Even if you don't split 50/50, it's a household issue and you should split the cost within your means. Your husband should also educate himself about the animals he's chosen to care for.", "I don\u2019t want to say you are the AH but I also don\u2019t think you\u2019re husband should pay for it by himself. It was an honest mistake and the cats are both of yours. It sucks but it\u2019s a joint responsibility.", "Might be one of my \"bad takes\", but I'm going with ESH. I think both of you should pay half. Don't have kids until you work these issues out, are you going to have this petty argument when one of them get seriously sick? If you agreed to split finances, then split finances, stop trying to penalize each other for honest mistakes.", "So if you do something wrong in the future will you pay for everything?", "I have also had the emergency vet bill ($2000) when my cat chewed an Easter lily. \n\nI really think that it should be publicized more, what a danger they are! It seems like every Christmas I see a zillion articles about pets and poinsettias, but I never see articles about lilies at Easter (and lilies are actually MORE toxic than poinsettias). \n\nHowever. The idea that \"it was his fault even though it was totally unintentional\" is bad for your marriage. Accidents happen, and not everyone can know everything. I am a careful and consientious pet owner and I didn't know about lilies! Before you get on your moral high horse, can you be 100% certain that you are the world's expert on everything and you will never, ever make a mistake? Suppose you are moving and a box of dishes slips out of your hands and they all break. Should you have to pay for them because you \"could have been more careful,\" or should the cost come out of a joint household budget? When your home needs repairs, are you going to start arguing about who forgets to turn out the lights so the bulbs burn out faster, or who used more toilet paper and caused a clog and it's their fault that you had to call a plumber? When your kids get sick and you need to pay for the doctor, are you going to start blaming each other for whose fault it was that they went out in the cold/didn't wash their hands/ate too much candy/whatever it is that made them get sick? This is just a terrible idea. I truly understand that you're having sticker shock and panicking, but you need to classify the cat as joint property, pay for it jointly, and let this go.", "NAH Pets are expensive. He didn't do anything malicious. Split the bill.", "This one is hard and i dont think either one is an AH. I would say that sharing the cost 50/50 would be fair. ur husband didn't know and it would not be fair to expect someone to know everything. Also when u get a pet u have to accept that sometimes u will have to pay for things that aren't yours or ur pets fault.  Also it doesn't matter who makes more money in the relationship. u shouldn't expect ur husband to cough it up just because he has a bigger and more secure income.", "I\u2019ll go with NAH\n\nIt\u2019s understandable your husband didn\u2019t know. This isn\u2019t super common knowledge. The fact that you knew means you still have your cats and they\u2019re not dead. I get where each of you is coming from.\n\nThis kind of thing is part of why my wife and I don\u2019t split our finances. We have our own fun money line items in the budget, but everything else goes together and we contribute to things together. If we had cats, this would be coming out of a veterinarian line item (and probably pulling from others as well to cover the cost).\n\nYou are married; everything you do is intertwined. Either split it evenly, or split it by the percentage of the money each of you brings in. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for either of you to have to pay for it 100%.\n\nHowever, you both need to sit down and have a frank conversation about finances. You need to have clear boundaries on how various finances are handled. I personally don\u2019t understand why married couples will have completely separate finances, but that\u2019s me and I know it works well for plenty of people. But you all need to have some common funds too, otherwise this will always be a problem. It shouldn\u2019t be about the two of you protecting \u201cyour\u201d money. What\u2019s yours is his and what\u2019s his is yours.\n\nMarriage is giving 100% of yourself to the other. It\u2019s not about contributing 50% each. Obviously, that only works when both people have that attitude.\n\nIMO, split the cost of the bill, then sit down and figure out your finances and how you address things that aren\u2019t all one person or all the other. What happens when you need a house repair? When you replace an appliance? Unexpected things come up, you need a plan now for how to handle them.", "NAH\n\nYour husband didn't know of its toxicity or presume of it. \n\nMarriage is a partnership. You're supposed to \"be one\". I don't understand why people have split finances in marriage and then come up with these situations when in reality, the money should be *both of yours*.\n\nThis is what causes divorces imo. You both should pay off the amount from your emergency fund (not putting it on 19% interest rate credit cards) and then rebuild the emergency fund.\n\nAnd both of you should look into what plants are toxic to cats.", "Info: Are the cats fine now?

Do you feel that splitting bills 50-50 is unreasonable given the income disparity and is that shaping your feelings about this bill? To me it sounds like $3k would be a big hit to either of you, but maybe there's a place in between if the finances of both paying half feels more burdensome to you (eg what if you pay $1k and he pays $2k or something)", "[deleted]", "I feel like, if I heard that a plant was dangerous to cats, I would (and have) make sure I told everyone I know that has cats just in case.

This kind of score keeping is not a good idea in marriage. It was an honest mistake. Hug your kitties and thank goodness you were able to get them to the vet quickly. I've heard too many versions where the cats didn't survive.", "YTA. Don't get pets if you are not financially prepared for emergencies like this. It is just irresponsible. It was an accident. Playing the blame game will drive a wedge in your marriage and cause resentment. I have both a cat and dog that I got before meeting my husband. I have educated him on these household things that can be dangerous, like grapes with dogs. Why have you not discussed these things with him? If you know these things, why not have this discussion?\n\nSplit the cost and have a conversation.", "YTA. \n\nThe cats belong to both of you and are a shared responsibility. Your husband couldn\u2019t have avoided the cats injuries since he has no idea the plant was toxic. You can\u2019t penalize someone for breaking a rule they didn\u2019t know about. If he had repeatedly left the back door ajar and the cats had gotten hit by a car it would be different since the injuries resulted from his carelessness.", "Minor ESH y\u2019all are partners and this is unhealthy. I\u2019d hope if you make an honest mistake he\u2019d share the burden", "Well, if you think of it, treat your animals the same way you would anyone else in your family. \n\nIf you had your sister get into an accident, and the only medical center was asking for $50,000 upfront before they'd attempt to save her, would you? \n\nAnother point is, that cat is BOTH of your responsibility. You're married to him, he's not a visiting boyfriend. So that cat is owned by both of you. 50/50 split is the only way, if you have separate finances. It wasn't his intention to kill anyone, and it was smart of you to know the toxic plants so now you have this amazing chance to save your animals. so stop thinking about the money and GO SAVE YOUR CAT.", "YTA. You are married, they're both your pets, and both your responsibilities. This was an accident, you both wanted make sure the cats were okay, you should share the cost.", "NTA\n\nYou're not the asshole for \"suggesting\" it, it doesn't mean that he will accept though.

I was fully aware of lily toxicity and cats, but was not home to stop this from happening - it went on behind my back. Had I not discovered it when I came home, our cats would be dead. I was up all night sobbing. \n\nPart of me thinks I\u2019d be the AH if I make him pay for this though because it was an honest mistake and he obviously feels horrible. I don\u2019t want it to seem like I\u2019m \u201cpunishing\u201d him, but on the other hand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for my finances to take such a hit for something I had absolutely no part in. So, AITA?\n\nMore context: both my husband and I work full time and have well-paying jobs. He makes $15k more than me per year, if that matters.
