I think there's more nuance here that makes giving a clear judgment more difficult.\n\nFor me, as an agender person, I went through a period of time of wanting to try a new name. I finally settled on a more gender neutral name that felt more like me than my online handle, but I don't really experience gender dysphoria as often or in the same way as other trans people often do, so I don't mind my birth name either and deal with it a lot irl.\n\nMy thought process is, if your real name garners such a strong emotional reaction, it might not be surprising or a bad thing to distance yourself from others with that name. However, I would also explain it that way, since it's easy here to come off as \"only I can have this name\" which is unrealistic. Also if this person has a history of copying you, then the name choice is kinda odd.\n\nOn the other hand, if it just *bothers* you because you feel possessive about the name, you may be TA. You don't own the name, and if you like this person, it seems odd to me to sever a friendship over it. Well within your rights, of course, but possibly an AH move. Also taking into account, at least from my own experience, that the first try is just that; a try. They may find the name doesn't feel like them after all and want to try on another.\n\nI'm going with NAH for the moment unless I learn some new info.", "NTA\n\nYour trans friend can be whoever they want to be but copying your name just screams of attention seeking.", "I mean, you have to feel comfortable, and not everything has to evolve around them.

IMO if something doesn\u2019t directly impact my life or bring harm to others it\u2019s not an issue. A friend (transgender or otherwise) wanting to adopt my first name as their own would be a non-issue. Ask yourself those types of questions before making a decision to cut contact. Yes, your friend group will now have two people with the same name, but does that really matter? Now if you had said this person wanted to adopt your whole name (first, middle, and last) and started to adopt your identity (appearance, mannerisms, etc.) then I would say it\u2019s a concerning issue.", "NAH, but as I'm sure you know this time of transition is going to feel vulnerable and challenging for your friend.
