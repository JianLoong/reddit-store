Them changing their name to that would create a lot of confusion. They told OP they were thinking about it and OP reasonably told them it would made them uncomfortable. Why would they stay close friends with someone that didn\u2019t care if they made them uncomfortable and maybe felt like they were wanting to be OP. Especially as their friends group could get confused online over it.", "I'm not sure why anything has to be confusing. I dated a guy with my same name for a couple of years. It was a little weird at first but it really wasn't a big deal.\n\nI also work with someone with my name as well--first AND last. Occasionally, people get confused but not often, and it's very easy to deal with.", "How is it confusing? Have you never had two friends with the same name?", "They're in the same online social circle, and everyone uses usernames, not real names. \n\nIt's not confusing because only OP's bf calls her by her real name even though her real name is known. \n\nIt's not that confusing.", "The only person in this social circle who calls OP by their real name is their boyfriend, though. So it's not like that is going to get confusing. OP will mostly be referred to as their screen name, and I assume that this friend will also still be referred to as their screen name. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know how I feel about this one! I think I need more INFO: OP says they're not cis. Is this a name that they chose outside of their birth name? For some reason, I feel like that would make it worse.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right?  I mean the last time I threw a fit about one of my friends copying me I was in grade school and my mom was having to explain that to me.  Are we not adults capable of being gracious in situations like this?\n\nOP is totally entitled to having and enforcing a boundary over the name thing but I still think they're immature and an AH.", "I literally wouldn't care and might even be quite flattered because I am an adult.  I mean, I got a mullet recently and my friend thought it was cool and went and got a mullet a few days later... It was quite a compliment that they liked my new hairstyle enough to do it themself.  You never ask your friends where they got a particular clothing item or what brand of make up they're wearing because you'd like to get the same thing?", "I agree that they're entitled to their boundary and are allowed to end a friendship for any reason or no reason at all.

Oh don't like it? I don't care.\"\n\nBecause it's *NOT* just about the name, OP shared their worries and their uncomfortable feelings about the idea, and the friend steamrolled through them, completely disrespecting their friendship.

The trans friend made an informed, conscious decision to be an asshole.", "I think this might be some brigading tbh - a bunch of people are now commenting all over this post calling everyone transphobic.", "See *that* is different, but OP didn't say that initially in the post. Was going off the original post, and there's so many comments that wherever that clarification is I didn't see it.", "I\u2019m not saying you intended it like that, just answering your question.", "How often does an OP leave something out of their post that\u2019s relevant? All the time. OP hasn\u2019t really elaborated on why he friend choosing her name bothers her, and it\u2019s even not clear she\u2019s really thought much more deeply about it than just recognizing she doesn\u2019t like the idea- but if she reflected on it more, I think they are probably linked.\n\nThis is also a thing I\u2019ve witnessed multiple times before with friends changing their name (in both similar and different contexts), which is probably why I\u2019m inclined to think this is the case: a lot of them first choose the name of someone else they admire/wish to emulate rather than thinking about what name suits them personally. It often doesn\u2019t stick, fortunately, but it can cause some tension if the person whose name they chose is someone they actually interact with.", "I agree, it's weird but there isn't enough context in the post to judge imo. Like no reflections on why their friend is doing this, why they'd lose a friendship over it.", "My take is it\u2019s a NAH situation, but I can understand why it would feel hurtful and or confusing to OP.

Would have been totally different had he chosen that name after we met.", "I mean, I'd be less bothered by someone copying my wardrobe or hairstyle than by them copying my name, but both are a bit disconcerting.", "Meeting someone who already had the same name as you is different from someone choosing to change their name to yours. There are literally thousands of different names out there, but they decided to lump their attachment to OP onto the name and insist it's the only name they'd ever want.", "my friend Sam dated a woman named Sam for years. they both just referred to themselves and each other as just Sam, it was hilarious.", "People are more than allowed to want some semblance of personal differences from other people, and not everyone wants a name that literally everyone else also has, get off your high horse, *Sam*.", "That\u2019s great for you! \n\nUnfortunately, OP\u2019s feelings are still valid the same as yours are. OP communicated her feelings and they should be respected.\n\nFor instance, some people are flattered by strangers complimenting them in public. Some people feel extremely threatened being approached by people they don\u2019t know. Both are valid ways to feel, and should be adhered to.", "Exactly. You have *no* idea how hard Ive fought ppl on that exact same concept lol. \n\nUnfortunately I've had the experience in real life where I finally had to cut off one of my best friends growing up. He came out as gay & then went *super* into the stereotypical femboy, hitting on *absolutely* every straight guy he came into contact with. Im talking overboard, harassment style, groping & all. Made a *Lot* of our straight friends super uncomfortable & start to distance from the group. To guys who had made it clear they werent at all interested & he just *would not stop*! Any new guy boyfriend thatd even try to be around would immediately be targeted & even their own girlfriends were blowing it off & taking up for him because \"He finally gets to be out, hes not hurting you\"! \n\nAny attempt to reign him in a bit or calm his ass down & I was met with all kinds of garbage of \"Hes living his *true* self, dont be an asshole\" & just made out to be the bad guy cuz, damn.... Its wrong to act like that to *anybody* WTF?! Made me feel like *I* was the crazy one lol \n\nFinally had to straight up tell him I was done & not to even talk to me anymore, I couldnt handle it. Ppl like that make us *ALL* look bad & I told him \"One day when some straight dude beats the living fuck outta you for grabbing their junk, it *WONT* be because your gay & theyre homophobic... Itll be because youre an asshole & deserve to be punched in the throat for how youre acting\" \n\nSure enough I heard once he got to college he pulled that shit on the wrong person & thankfully wasnt hurt too badly but I mean....

I think a lot of the accusatory transphobic comments may have been made before that, too.. but the person at the top of this chain is saying it's transphobic that some commenters guessed that before OP said it.\n\nWhich is interesting, because yeah it's not great to stereotypes.. but also the stereotype was indeed the case here, so..\n\nIt's nice to be sometime a trans friend can look up to and want to learn from. But getting that learning by just straight up copying them, up to and including using their name? That's too much.", "[deleted]", "I know what you mean. I had a roommate at one point who had the same name as me. I currently have a coworker who has the same name as me. That's whatever.

It's imitation. Not original, creative,  or unique. Some people don't want to be copied.
