BUT you two need to sit down and write out the expenses and show her how the mortgage is not sustainable. What good is buying a house that you may potentially lose because you cannot afford it?\n\nSome questions to ask her: Is she willing to work to help with the mortgage? Is she willing to give up other luxuries and live on a tight budget? Is she willing to not allow the baby to be in extra curricular activities when it\u2019s older because there isn\u2019t room in the budget? Is she ok not going on vacations, etc? \n\nThis is going to be a mess and you may need to seek therapy to help with overall communication and boundary setting with family.
