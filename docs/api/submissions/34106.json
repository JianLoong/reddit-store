I get where your family is coming from; kids learn best by watching what their parents do and watching you two put thought and time into buying gifts is one way to model generosity. But there are other ways, like each parent making sure kiddo gets (or makes) the other parent a thoughtful gift. And kiddo will see you both being generous and thoughtful to each other and to others in your daily life in ways other than gifts and learn from that, too. (Arguably, learn more!)"]}
