I would completely expect a  fourteen year old boy would not want to see a female doctor and the appointment shouldn't have even been made that way to start with.", "It\u2019s not sexist as he is not judging them. He doesn\u2019t suggest the male doctor is more competent. It\u2019s about his comfort level.", "How is it sexist\nIt is normal that a 14 year old does not want a female doctor to see his gun\nIf it was a girl everyone would say it\u2019s completely fine", "Well first off he's 14, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's probably not comfortable undressing in front of strange women. \n\nSecond, it's a 14-year-old boy. Can you really not think of any other reason why he may not want a woman touching him while he's partially undressed, *with his mother in the room*? Really? 1", "Because I don\u2019t feel comfortable undressing in front of a woman especially one I don\u2019t even know", "Probably the same reason some females ask for female Drs.", "Who cares. A patient has a right to choose their doctor if something is making them uncomfortable.", "Does it matter?", "It\u2019s very dependent what country you\u2019re from as well too.\n\nFor me, male and female doctors have been equally good.", "Smaller fingers too :)", "Yes, they kept me in for everything else but the drop the drawers part.", "Lmao I'll never forget going to the [male] psychiatrist and he asked me why I was so tired and pale looking that day... I just wasn't wearing any makeup. I only wear blush and eyeliner. Didn't see him too much longer after that. (For various reasons.) I now have a woman psychiatrist.", "I mean if he said it like that there would presumably be some follow up questions but while its less common lots of people prefer doctors of the opposite sex its not automatically creepy.", "If they used language that wasn't totally crude, sure. It's his body, end of story. Also no worse than the old farts in hospitals that still ask for the \"little lady\" to give them their sponge bath \ud83e\udd2e", "If it\u2019s because they are uncomfortable it\u2019s fine.  If it\u2019s because they don\u2019t believe the female doctor to be competent based on gender it is not.", "for deciding whether he's an asshole it 100% does matter, there are plenty of reasons that would make him one", "Yes", "I've had great female doctors and great male doctors. My best was my male OB who was SUPER attentive. He delivered two of my kiddos and made sure I was ALWAYS put on his schedule during my last high risk pregnancy. There was another male doctor in the practice and he was...a disappointment. Always kind of rushed through and never really \"looked\" at you if that makes sense. \n\nSo, I think it's less about gender and more about the type of person they are.", "He was fine with the doctor until he was asked to take his pants off. It's not like he refused a female doctor for a broken arm.", "Dude come on hes 14 NTA obviously", "Why would it matter? A physician exam is an intimate matter. Why would anyone need to state WHY they don't want intimate contact, regardless of the nature of the contact?"]}
