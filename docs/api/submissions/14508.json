Things can get very messy when money is involved so be careful and do consider a pre-nup.\n\nI say this as the child from a previous relationship, so my view is a bit skewed in the favour of the child tbh. In my experience, Having a parent have a baby and get married in rapid succession can feel like they\u2019re building a life without you and you\u2019re just here for the ride whether you like it or not.

You are already making it very clear to the family who/what your priorities are, and that will have impact on the rest of your time with this family and how they relate to you. \n\nI\u2019d really take this opportunity to think about what it means to you to be a stepparent and what you want this family you\u2019re creating to look like and how you want it to function and get on the same page with Brian before you\u2019re legally married. Are you going to be involved in Ashley\u2019s life? Do you not want to be? Where do those financial responsibilities lie? Are you keeping separate accounts?

You don't have to help out the girl, but as her future step mum, you should want to. The fact that you adamantly don't because she's \"not your kid\" really shows her that she's nothing to you. I mean, you are giving preference to your own non existent bio kid already, and that hypothetical child may never even exist (you never know, I know plenty of people who can't conceive no matter how hard they try). I as a parent, could NEVER have children with someone who would treat the kids I already have as less than, I can't even understand how someone would.

It\u2019s very believable that you could throw your step daughter a bone of $10K and still have enough to practically give your baby a free ride without continued contributions. \n\nWhat if your kid doesn\u2019t even want to go to college? \n\n\nEveryone else sucks because \nIt\u2019s terrible boundaries that everyone seems to think they can tell you what to do with your money", "Nta, but short of an all out war, how about this; \nYou won = 100% yours.\nYour baby with X = 50% you, 50% dad.\nBecause you share, dad pays all taxes.  25% gross of dad's must go to your baby with him. \nAnything left over he can do whatever.  \n\nSimply put, 75% of gross winnings goes to your/his baby.

Emergency fund is always needed because we never fully know our SO and people change.", "Same, here. It sure came in handy when I had to file for divorce.\n\nOP. NTA.", "Honestly a massive mistake I made in my 10 year marriage was not having a secret account from my husband. My dad strongly encouraged me to do this and I didn't. My husband left me for another women and I had to start all over. Had I set aside even $100 a year, I would have had an extra $1,000 to help me during the divorce.", "I think you mean well but with divorce rates at 50% give or take a few percent, no one intends to get divorced.  You trust them when you marry but things can go downhill for any number of reasons.  I'm not sure I know many people at all who doesn't keep some money stashed away for 'just in case'...  I don't mean to offend you or your comment, just making an observation.", "This. It's one thing to know your partner is bad with money so you don't trust them with the account, it's another thing to completely hide something from your partner because you don't trust them AND YET you still marry them and make all these promises about faithfulness and sick and health.\n\nIt just don't compute.", "it's not that I don't trust my SO,  He's does a poor job of managing money.   Loves to spend, buy clothes and every shiny object.  If I didn't keep money set aside, we'd have nothing saved.   I sold a piece of property (self employed) and he already has every penny \"spent\" when I specifically dedicated this $ for retirement income.  It's frustratingly hard.", "I have savings accounts my partner doesn't know the details about, he doesn't need to know about them and he isn't interested in knowing about them. One has money from my Mum's death, one was a rainy day gift from my Dad and one I pay into regularly. He knows they are there but not the splits or amounts because they are used for purchases like cars, major house repair and that's it.\n\nThough I was advised by older ladies to have a fund to myself because they came from a time where married women were only allowed joint accounts and mortgages. If things happened - few people set up to be abusers, circumstances and stresses change - then it was good to have an independent, secret source of money to get away. Was awkward when Mum died to give her's to my Dad - he was also relieved as knew she had cards but didn't know where they were - but as he said \"She'd never needed to use it\" in near-on 30 years.\n\nEdit: Staying when you have the option to leave is also a sign of love and a good marriage. Staying because you are financially trapped isn't.", "Wow!  You sound really smart, I came into a great deal of money with the death of my wife, well north of 2 mil but you'd never know it.  I got a new SUV, a Toyota not a BMW or Mercedes, I got myself and my little girls a new, larger house we can grow into and I stopped working.  All my daughters know is that daddy is with them most of the time, not farmed out to babysitters or a day care.  We go to parks, libraries, whatever we want to do and will be homeschooled.  Money is a tool for me, it helps my girls and I to do what we WANT to do, not what I HAVE to do.  Invested wisely it should a lifetime.", "Yeah but unless you don\u2019t trust your partner, there\u2019s no reason for \u201cjust in case\u201d money to be secret. My husband and I share finances, but we also each have private savings accounts that we had before we were married that the other doesn\u2019t have access to. But\u2026it\u2019s not a secret. We know about the accounts we just leave them alone.", "> I don\u2019t think that setting up a \u201cjust in case\u201d fund for yourself that only you know about is to the degree of the untrustworthiness that you mention.\n\nDepends on the size of the fund. This comment thread is fundamentally about a person hiding a million dollars in lottery money for 'many years.'", "Having a plan is good. Having a *secret* plan is questionable. I have backup money that my husband can't access but he knows about it, at least.", "> Having a \u201cjust in case\u201d fund doesn\u2019t have to mean one is spending their life with someone who they inherently don\u2019t trust\n\nIt does though. Purely because you used the word *inherently*. Having a \"just in case fund\" doesn't mean you have zero trust in your partner (you can trust them in other ways), but it DOES mean you inherently (i.e. permanently) don't trust them, hence why you keep the account.\n\nThat said, that inherent distrust is an inherent distrust of people and being that your partner is a person, that inherent distrust includes them.", "I disagree. I don\u2019t think that having a bit of money tucked away for \u201cjust in case\u201d, especially if you are a woman, only means that you don\u2019t trust your partner. To me it means that you will be prepared for any situation that may come, and I think this is especially important if children are involved.\n\nYou guys can continue to tell me what I actually mean, or continue to tell me I\u2019m incorrect, but I still won\u2019t agree with you. Have fun!", "Ok Superior Wordsmith. I disagree.", "I\u2019m not arguing that having money tucked away means you don\u2019t trust your partner. I\u2019m arguing that if you feel the need to keep it a secret then THAT means you don\u2019t trust your partner\u2014at least in some way in some level. I have money tucked away so I can be prepared for any situation that may come. My partner has no access to that money (unless I give it to him)..  But he\u2019s aware of its existence. I can\u2019t imagine needing to hide it unless he\u2019d shown himself to be\u2026well untrustworthy"]}
