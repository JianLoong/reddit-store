Things can get very messy when money is involved so be careful and do consider a pre-nup.\n\nI say this as the child from a previous relationship, so my view is a bit skewed in the favour of the child tbh. In my experience, Having a parent have a baby and get married in rapid succession can feel like they\u2019re building a life without you and you\u2019re just here for the ride whether you like it or not.

You are already making it very clear to the family who/what your priorities are, and that will have impact on the rest of your time with this family and how they relate to you. \n\nI\u2019d really take this opportunity to think about what it means to you to be a stepparent and what you want this family you\u2019re creating to look like and how you want it to function and get on the same page with Brian before you\u2019re legally married. Are you going to be involved in Ashley\u2019s life? Do you not want to be? Where do those financial responsibilities lie? Are you keeping separate accounts?

You don't have to help out the girl, but as her future step mum, you should want to. The fact that you adamantly don't because she's \"not your kid\" really shows her that she's nothing to you. I mean, you are giving preference to your own non existent bio kid already, and that hypothetical child may never even exist (you never know, I know plenty of people who can't conceive no matter how hard they try). I as a parent, could NEVER have children with someone who would treat the kids I already have as less than, I can't even understand how someone would.

It\u2019s very believable that you could throw your step daughter a bone of $10K and still have enough to practically give your baby a free ride without continued contributions. \n\nWhat if your kid doesn\u2019t even want to go to college? \n\n\nEveryone else sucks because \nIt\u2019s terrible boundaries that everyone seems to think they can tell you what to do with your money", "Nta, but short of an all out war, how about this; \nYou won = 100% yours.\nYour baby with X = 50% you, 50% dad.\nBecause you share, dad pays all taxes.  25% gross of dad's must go to your baby with him. \nAnything left over he can do whatever.  \n\nSimply put, 75% of gross winnings goes to your/his baby.

She has two parents already who are putting up money for her but she, and others, are mad that another person, you, is not also contributing?  EF that.", "I agree.  Right now make sure that all of your finances are solely under your control.  Separate everything.  Do not jointly own anything.  Decide if you truly want to have him involved in your life forever because you have just found out that he is not the man you thought he was.  \n\nThis is your baby, and you do not have to put the sperm donor\u2019s name on the birth certificate.  If you do decide to keep this leech in your life, see a lawyer about child custody and payment of child support.  If you legally acknowledge him as the father, you will never be free of him.", "I agree. Her fiance nor the future stepdaughter will ever let this go. It really sucks for OP, but this is just the beginning.", "This is the way. \n\nNTA", "Yes, would love to know the answer to this....", "Plus after tax that's 25k.", "Agreed.  Especially is MIL is throwing her two cents into it already!  Both Children are going to be her grandchildren.  WTF?!?", "Or rethink the relationship if he\u2019s this entitled now", "Agreed. There will be many times OP will be reminded that she\u2019s \u201cnot the parent\u201d in future. If she gave the kid money like a parent would, that would create resentment. But if she wisely put it aside for now, she would be easier in her supporting parental role. And a no is easier to turn into a yes. I wouldn\u2019t promise anything this far out.", "She overheard our conversation. We didn\u2019t realize she had walked in the house.", "I\u2019ll counter with saying that if her and her fianc\u00e9 was already married then you would have a point. However they are not. He could walk away tomorrow and leave her to raise a child alone. \n\nThe fact he told his daughter about this money is a big red flag. I honestly would do what op is suggesting and keep the money for the baby. I would also suggest keeping the money where only she has access to it. Right now her only responsibility os to her child. If they where married then the dynamic would be different to an extent. Op is not responsible for funding stepdaughters college. Stepdaughter has 2 parents. Now her baby is her responsibility.", "My question is why does op future step daughter even know about the money and how it is being used. That should have stayed between op and her bf.", "Well I don\u2019t agree with YTA but I agree that OP could have phrased things in a more strategic way. Either don\u2019t tell them about it (and pay the taxes out of the award money) or say that you\u2019re investing it in retirement and then \u201cmove money around\u201d later once Ashley\u2019s past college aged. I really don\u2019t think that they have any right to the money but jealousy is a natural response", "I would agree if her and the fianc\u00e9 was married. But they are not until they are it\u2019s just her money and she needs to think about her child.", "Not her step daughter yet. And besides she has a mother and a father to provide for her college education. Any thing can happen between now and their wedding. Maybe revisit the issue after they marry. NTA", "I agree.  \nA 14 year old is a kid. Either you love her or you don't. She knows about the money.  \n\nI guess I would have put the money in a growth fund with a smaller but undisclosed % for Ashley and just said I have put it away for both our girls. So yeah,  YTA\n\nThe end.", "Stepdaughter has two parents to provide for her college and isn't entitled to OP's money - pregnant or not. It would not be remotely fair to have three parents contributing to stepdaughter's college when OP's baby only has two. Further, OP has paid the tax on the winnings herself and can allocate it as she sees fit.", "I honestly haven\u2019t thought about what I\u2019d do with it if I wasn\u2019t pregnant. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "I disagree. OP should obviously treat Ashley equally in day to day interactions and give her love and support. But for financial matters, it\u2019s unfair to demand that OP pay for her stepdaughters college. It\u2019s like inheritance. Ashley\u2019s mom isn\u2019t going to pay for OP\u2019s child to go to college or split inheritance with them. There shouldn\u2019t be the opposite expectation", "No, your signing up for a partner who is a parent to a child they share with someone from a previous relationship.\n\nThe plan for this girls future should be handled between her parents, of which OP is neither of those two people. **They should plan for her future like OP doesn\u2019t exist, because she isn\u2019t obligated to be a major contributor just by virtue of being with her dad.**\n\nWill the fianc\u00e9s ex pay into the baby\u2019s college fund, since they had 14 additional years to save and his daughter would have the contribution of 3 adults financially, **for the sake of equity?**\n\nOP isn\u2019t a jerk for not shelling out thousands of dollars to a child who isn\u2019t even her stepchild yet.", "I\u2019m currently pregnant with that child.", "If they don\u2019t want to go to college then they could use the money to start a family, start a business, buy a house, etc. one they\u2019re a certain age without college.", "Her and the finance are not married what happens if she gives stepdaughter 1/3 and the separate tomorrow. She needs to keep the money and save it for just incase.", "what gives him the right to even think he could spend it? They weren't married when she won it.\n\nAll she had to do is say she had a little money saved up, not tell him the amount, because he didn't need to know .It was her money.", "I COMPLETELY agree. My father passed away when I was 21.  He was an amazing guy, my parents were together since middle school. My mom is now remarried to a man who is very, very well off. She has a great life. She travels all over the world. But I would absolutely never expect for him to pay for anything for me. I\u2019m extremely grateful that my mother is taken care of, comfortable and happy. I don\u2019t need anything more than that. Would I love my tens of thousands of dollars of college debt to be paid off, which he could do without a second thought? Sure? But it\u2019s MINE. I\u2019m not his child and he owes me absolutely nothing. And I lose zero sleep over that. He is insanely generous and I appreciate everything that he does for my family, myself, and my Mother, with whom he is in the relationship with! Daughter has two parents. Just because somebody won the lottery doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to bonus money.", "Personally, I would take the money off the table and say that after more thought you plan to invest it for your own retirement. You can always quietly gift some or all of it much later.", "Did your fianc\u00e9 know about it before this conversation?", "True...but that child having a sister...and they are going to be married...she doesn't need to give the money right away...but put it aside until they married", "I aggree revisit just after marriage, but that does not seem to be Op's intent. And unless she is having doubts about marrying, she should be open to consider the kid her family too.", "Never said kids was entitled to it. Just that it's be nice.\nAlso, parents should help with the taxes if OP does do anything.", "Yeah I would talk to a financial advisor to make sure if you have another child they could have a college fund also. \n\nI don\u2019t know why everyone thinks thee so enough money for 2 or 3 kids . After taxes you will be lucky to get $25000", "This exact. Step daughter already has both of her parents support. OP is looking out for her child and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.", "[deleted]", "Op do what you think is best. Protect yourself and your baby. The fact your fianc\u00e9 seem entitled to tell you how to spend your money is a big red flag.", "I just want to quickly point out that if your child goes to/only gets into a private college in the US, then 70k can barely cover tuition + housing for one year. Even in state colleges are about 34k a year, and tuition is literally rising every year so there is literally no way that you would \"still have enough to practically give your baby a free ride.\" This money is yours before you get married, you're spending it on your fiance's child, and honestly after taxes it really isn't going to be that much at all.", "So I guess you aren\u2019t thinking of a 529 plan for your kiddo? \n\nHow are you planning to keep up with taxes on the gains?", "Most married couples have some degree of shared finances. Not crazy to think that if my spouse had a few thousand when we married that it would be a shared asset afterwards. In his case it eventually became over a million. Great news but also a shock to know she'd hidden something like that.", "It's comments like this that make me think Redditors don't live in reality.\n\nI mean, come on dude. Don't be stupid. Learn about humans and relationships. Maybe eventually have one for yourself.", "Exactly this!", "But she still has a college fund which her parents are contributing to and they still have 4 more years to add to it. Why should OP set aside money for her when she is not even her stepdaughter yet?", "I\u2019m not having anymore children after her. I can\u2019t. She\u2019s my one and done.", "Isn\u2019t that kinda of what the fianc\u00e9 is doing to op. He is trying to decide where to spend the money he isn\u2019t entitled too.\n\nI see red flags with the fianc\u00e9. Op needs to put the money away where it can not be touched.", "As long as you keep a separate account, it doesn't become a shared asset. Any increase would unless you had a prenuptial that said otherwise", "im sorry, I don't understand what your point is supposed to be.\n\nWhile I agree it seems Reddit doesn't live in reality a great deal of the time, I fail to see what I mentioned is not a possible outcome.\n\nSome couples have a \"yours, mine and ours\" financial setup.And it works.", "I would still talk to a financial advisor and see how to best invest this for your child. \n\nAs for your fianc\u00e9 I would rethink this the fact he doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries is a big red flag!\n\nI would also make sure this money is somewhere it can\u2019t be touched. Just incase something happens to you before you put it in a trust because if it is somewhere your fianc\u00e9 can get it he will give it to his older daughter. Go ahead and talk to a lawyer to set up a trust and make sure the trust can\u2019t be accessed by your fianc\u00e9. But another trust adult in charge to make sure the trust stays safe. \n\nIt may be to much time on Reddit that has made me jaded.", "That\u2019s not at all true", "If you truly don't understand what my post is, you must not experience emotions or are just a troll. Let me be clear: its OK for humans to act illogically. It's OK for humans to react to stimuli based on emotion without thinking things through. It's OK for humans to make mistakes, Star Traveler. \n\nI never said the dad was CORRECT for saying / acting how he did. The bottom line is human relationships are more complicated than \"What is logical BEEP ZORP.\"\n\nSomeone can be logically correct for making a certain decision and still be an asshole because people are not solely logical beings and have nuance.\n\nSo go outside and meet some humans, I bet you'll be shocked at the illogical behavior.", "Okay?", "Glad you agree. Bye!"]}
