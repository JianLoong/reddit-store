When you agreed to marrying the man, you also agreed to getting a daughter.\n\nI\u2019d suggest handing over about 5-10k. It\u2019ll top up your future step-daughters college fund but it won\u2019t massively underfund your own child\u2019s trust fund, you\u2019ll be able to replace this amount after a few years, and it\u2019ll show you care about the family your marrying into. Things can get very messy when money is involved so be careful and do consider a pre-nup.\n\nI say this as the child from a previous relationship, so my view is a bit skewed in the favour of the child tbh. In my experience, Having a parent have a baby and get married in rapid succession can feel like they\u2019re building a life without you and you\u2019re just here for the ride whether you like it or not.

You are already making it very clear to the family who/what your priorities are, and that will have impact on the rest of your time with this family and how they relate to you. \n\nI\u2019d really take this opportunity to think about what it means to you to be a stepparent and what you want this family you\u2019re creating to look like and how you want it to function and get on the same page with Brian before you\u2019re legally married. Are you going to be involved in Ashley\u2019s life? Do you not want to be? Where do those financial responsibilities lie? Are you keeping separate accounts? Is Brian\u2019s responsible for both kids, you\u2019re only responsible for yours and his ex for Ashley?

When you marry someone who has children, you're signing up to treat them the same way you would treat your own children. If you can't do that, then it's entirely unfair to marry their parent. You don't have to help out the girl, but as her future step mum, you should want to. The fact that you adamantly don't because she's \"not your kid\" really shows her that she's nothing to you. I mean, you are giving preference to your own non existent bio kid already, and that hypothetical child may never even exist (you never know, I know plenty of people who can't conceive no matter how hard they try). I as a parent, could NEVER have children with someone who would treat the kids I already have as less than, I can't even understand how someone would.

It\u2019s very believable that you could throw your step daughter a bone of $10K and still have enough to practically give your baby a free ride without continued contributions. \n\nWhat if your kid doesn\u2019t even want to go to college? \n\n\nEveryone else sucks because \nIt\u2019s terrible boundaries that everyone seems to think they can tell you what to do with your money", "Nta, but short of an all out war, how about this; \nYou won = 100% yours.\nYour baby with X = 50% you, 50% dad.\nBecause you share, dad pays all taxes.  25% gross of dad's must go to your baby with him. \nAnything left over he can do whatever.  \n\nSimply put, 75% of gross winnings goes to your/his baby.

We know where we stand and we know in case of separation neither of us would be left with no money and no ressources. Private finances is an open door to financial abuse; if my husband makes all the money and I make none and I don\u2019t know how much his assets represent or how much he has saved up, then if he is stopping me from accessing ressources/abusing me I can\u2019t leave, because I can\u2019t access any money nor know what I am entitled to without a lawyer that I can\u2019t pay for. Potentially very dangerous situation.", "Making it about the number of parents each child \"gets\" to look after them is a really odd way of looking at this. If the older child's father had died (or died in the near future), would that make a difference?\n\nThis is about the two people who are about to be married and a mismatch of expectations between the two of them for the vision of their future family. Brian clearly expects him and OP to be full parents to his daughter and to treat her equally to the baby. OP doesn't have that expectation. There are no arseholes here but kind of odd they didn't talk about this before having another baby and deciding to get married.", "Yeah, it definitely depends on where you live and other circumstances", "No, making it about the amount of parents, and even grandparents, makes perfect sense and is a really common way of sorting out the finances when it comes to kids in mixed families. Why should Ashley get 33% more help towards school/first car/house/wedding than the baby? Why should Ashley get an \"equal\" amount from OPs parents for birthdays and Christmases, when she's got 2 biological sets of grandparents, one of which won't really know the baby from Adam and won't be giving the baby gifts? Yes, OPs parents should definitely get Ashley something for these occasions, but no, it should not be equal to what the baby gets from them. Baby only gets stuff from 2 sets of grandparents, unlike Ashley.  OPs parents should also feel completely free to set up financial help for the baby, but not for Ashley. Her maternal grandparents can do that, if they so please.   But OPs parents certainly shouldn't feel pressure to do so. \n\nOP is NTA in this situation, but someone certainly is."]}
