Things can get very messy when money is involved so be careful and do consider a pre-nup.\n\nI say this as the child from a previous relationship, so my view is a bit skewed in the favour of the child tbh. In my experience, Having a parent have a baby and get married in rapid succession can feel like they\u2019re building a life without you and you\u2019re just here for the ride whether you like it or not.

You are already making it very clear to the family who/what your priorities are, and that will have impact on the rest of your time with this family and how they relate to you. \n\nI\u2019d really take this opportunity to think about what it means to you to be a stepparent and what you want this family you\u2019re creating to look like and how you want it to function and get on the same page with Brian before you\u2019re legally married. Are you going to be involved in Ashley\u2019s life? Do you not want to be? Where do those financial responsibilities lie? Are you keeping separate accounts?

You don't have to help out the girl, but as her future step mum, you should want to. The fact that you adamantly don't because she's \"not your kid\" really shows her that she's nothing to you. I mean, you are giving preference to your own non existent bio kid already, and that hypothetical child may never even exist (you never know, I know plenty of people who can't conceive no matter how hard they try). I as a parent, could NEVER have children with someone who would treat the kids I already have as less than, I can't even understand how someone would.

But realistically after taxes op will be lucky to come out with $25,000 after all is said and done.", "If a future husband would dare to spend money from my savings without consulting me, that would be a huge No-Go.\n\nShared funds or not, you don't just spend money that was saved by another person first. \n\nCurrently my BF has saved quite a bit more than I, but I earn more than him and I'm actively saving, while his savings are more stagnant. \n\nI would never dare to demand access to his savings or funds, even for a downpayment on a shared asset. That stuff get's discussed and needs to be mutual decision.", "If with that lottery money you start a project that will get you a more stable income, of course. \n\nI was talking about raising the standards with only the lottery money.", "The kinds of luxuries they're talking about are houses, boats, supercars...things that have 6+ figure price tags and very high ongoing maintenance costs. That's what usually screws people who win big lottery prizes. If you're struggling and use the winnings to buy decent groceries, you're not being stupid with the money.", "That's why I talked about debt. One should get rid of it before getting non-essential luxury items. \n\nInvesting that wealth into improving your current situation, for example, focusing on improving profesional skills to get a better job also count as investing. \n\nYou are quick to assumptions, mate, don't do that. \nFirst of all, you know nothing about me.\nSecond of all, instead of pointing fingers at me accusing me of whatever you could have just give your point of view. We don't have to agree in everything. \n\nOh well, have a nice day.", "The answer to your question is context. \n\nWell, no, the biological mother has absolutely nothing to do with OP's baby. The difference is that OP is in a relationship with someone who had a kid before she got there, so whether she likes it or not, she has at least something to do with that kid. If the kid's dad has full or primary custody, then chances are, once they got together, the kid saw her more than she saw her biological mother. If it's split custody then they still spend quite a bit of time together. Either way, from the kid's perspective, it's going to feel like her future step mom doesn't care about what happens to her. Not only that, if she looks up to or admires OP even a little bit, she's not going to feel \"good enough\" for OP. You mentioned sharing equally? The only time I mentioned it was to advise that it should not be expected of her to do that. There are a lot of people painting this guy as some kind of greedy, malevolent, person, when there's no context suggesting that. If he was truly so greedy he'd want to use the money for himself in some way, not set it aside for his daughter's future. I'm giving the guy benefit of the doubt. Either way, I hope OP sees enough of the comments that are sane, and able to make her best judgement based on everything and not just the crazy prenup people.", "NTA. Pump the breaks on any marriage plans.", "A separate (not co-mingled) account from an inheritance. Not just any old account.", "Maybe that\u2019s the clue you need to not marry that person.", "Am picturing the scenes in Goodfellas after the Lufthansa heist!", "How about I need a house and cars? I'm not going to buy a mega mansion, but I would certainly be buying a nice house. The people who end up broke again are idiots. They do not comprise the bulk of winners. There are literal large prize winners every day. You get an estate firm who can guide you. To talk like you only put it all away...also age matters. What you do in your 20s is different than 50s or 70s. The idea people don't deserve to treat themselves a little is ridiculous.", "Not mate, so f*ck off. In the US, it becomes known pretty quick and any debt you owe is going to get paid, even if they have to sue you. Most start there. Also, if I win $50m, I can use it wisely and not work for others ever again. People free to do as they like, some decide to enjoy a big life because easy come, easy go. For others, it's actually leaches that cause the trouble. But I question people who have not struggled to understand what it's like to go from having literal nothing to sudden wealth and not knowing how to handle it or who to trust. Sometimes it's that they get bilked by pros, sometimes family. Every family has an Ashley that demands a college fund somewhere.", "I do not think he has done the wrong thing, the ex is the greedy one. I think hed be in his rights to negotiate after the fact and saying since one of hos children is at advantage could he save exclusively towards the eldest the next few years.i certainly think jumping to have prenup or divorce on whats here is ott.\nHowever, you are wrong about the bio mother having nothing to do with it. Its basic math and not that hard to understand frankly. If as you originally say both household parents share equally amongst two children to be equal, but the elder is being propped up by a third parent they wont in fact be equal. Lol.", "i think they should share finances on their own child and she should help raise his child somewhat but to just outright give her money for college is outrageous. that's a big cost and it should not be on her shoulders.", "So you decided to antagonize me, so be it.\n\nYou should know that I don't live in the US, you self-centered United Statian. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAgain, you do NOT know me so stop making assumptions about people you know nothing about.", "If that's what they want to do then fine. But OP clearly can't assume that this is the approach they're going to take without talking to her future husband about it.\n\nIt still seems a really odd approach to me personally. Number of living parents a child has isn't a good proxy for the amount of emotional and financial support the child will get. If you said they should make it fair by ensuring the amount of money in the funds is the same for each child that'd be one thing. But saying \"it's fair because you have an equal number of parents\" seems more like justifications than a true reason.\n\nAssume the same will apply when Ashley is upset about something at school and wants to talk to her step dad about it. *don't talk to me, talk to Bio dad because it won't be fair on your half sister*", "Well it seems to be what the OP wants to do and the fact is they aren't married and the money belongs to her.\n\nAnd with that last paragraph you took it to an odd extreme that isn't comparable.", "Yes it's good that he's found this out before they get married. Now Brian can consider if he wants to go ahead with the marriage given the boundaries OP wants to set in their family."]}
