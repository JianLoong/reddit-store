I think in Britain saying please super frequently is very normalised so people who don't do stick out.", "Where do you come from, if I may ask? There are few Brits in the comments saying that they think please is used much more frequently in the UK than in the US where, apparently, the language has evolved to a different direction and to a point where there are many accepted ways to make a polite request. \n\nSo at this point it'd be interesting to know if it's just Brits who are 'please' people or if it's other English speaking countries too. As a foreign language speaker I find myself using the American model much more (influence of tv, movies, books, etc.), and to me using please in polite requests comes naturally only in more formal registers or in some really specific situations. \n\nGotta love languages!", "This is an interesting idea. Growing up, my family used \u201cplease\u201d when they were being passive aggressive, so when I hear it sometimes (especially over small things) I have to do an internal double take.", "Language is very cool this way. Like how Brits and Americans have different definitions of the word quite, and Brits can add ed on to almost any emotive sounding word and make it mean drunk (or occasionally tired.)", "ESH\nThe fact that she\u2019s annoying, and she is. Doesn\u2019t add up to the fact that you do not say \u201cplease\u201d, and that is also not good etiquette. There is no contest here as of who\u2019s more of an AH. ESH.", "NTA. Can I leave?  No please. No thanks.", "NTA I don\u2019t find please necessary all the time. If my tone is pleasant and I will always say thank you at the end anyway.", "If you always say thank you why can't you say please.", "NTA, saying please is all well and good when you're dealing with someone you don't know well but it's meant to convey good intentions. Presumably, if people are friendly with her she *knows* their intent and therefore doesn't need to passive-aggressively remind them of \"please\" all the time.\n\nShe needs to simmer down.", "NTA - manners are nice and i often say please but let\u2019s be honest - could i, may i , can i etc are also informal  polite forms - while repeatedly correcting an adult as if they were a particularly dim 5 year old is condescending bullshit and very rude. \u2018 has no one asked her just how far up her arse she has shoved that stick (which would totally happen in Britain) .", "It's quite nice for people to say please and thank you. I think I know those words in six languages. But a lot is also covered by tone, and with people you know well the please is superfluous.  So your friend is being a fussbudget. As well as this, it is an extremely annoying habit. With her verbal tic of \"Please!\" she is treating grown adults like errant five year olds.\nEdit to say NTA.", "NTA the corrections is what the friend rude. Also I think saying please is great but it still requires moderation. But constant need to correct anyone\u2019s manners is exhausting and rude.", "NTA. Your husband, your house. None of her business!  I actually hate bad grammar, but I never correct anyone because it\u2019s damned rude!", "This is what Askamanager thinks about it https://www.askamanager.org/2018/05/my-coworker-keeps-demanding-i-say-please.html", "NTA.  Correcting someone else\u2019s manners is very poor etiquette.  Ask her \u201cPlease may you stop demonstrating poor etiquette with your constant corrections\u201d.", "NTA \n\nI think HER manners are really bad to be repeatedly correcting you. You are not her child and she is not responsible for any thing you say or do. It fine to correct her own kids, but to Do this to adult friends is so rude.", "The underlying basis of good manners is making others comfortable. That's the reason for using standard pleasantries (please, I'm fine thanks, etc.) even if they are not 100% meant. Also why people who brag about being \"completely honest\" often display bad manners generally.\n\nOP's friend is making others uncomfortable. That is the opposite of good manners. NTA.", "Emily Post says the same thing.", "I use please with strangers but not family and didn't realize that I did it until reading your comment.", "She's weaponizing manners for a power trip.", "This is very interesting because for me culturally I feel like I am being an asshole if I use please all the time with my family because that is implying I am not close with them. If my boyfriend, for example, said please, every time I would think he was mad at me.", "This has been brought up to me before, that I don't say please when asking a simple request, but I feel like inflection and tone count for a lot here. I don't think saying *may I grab that* is rude", "Same I always add a please when asking for something. It's natural.\n\nAnd when I hear people wanting things without a please in their sentence, it comes across as very entitled of them.", "Why would being polite to family member mean you aren\u2019t close to them?  Why wouldn\u2019t you let them know that you appreciate what they done- cook dinner or babysit or whatever by saying thank you?  If you don\u2019t say please and thank you how do you comun\u00edcate your gratitude? How do you avoid sounding like an entitled autocrat if you don\u2019t phrase your requests with please? It just seems like a small effort to give people who are important to you", "If some one tells me to say \"please\" over something so minor as 'can I borrow blank', especially from a friend, My 'please' will forever and always have a shitty tone when speaking in front of annoying person.  But if it's a situation that it's expected, or necessary, then it comes out normal.", "Oh, I say thank you but I don\u2019t need to say please because they know that I am seeing it in the tone of my voice.  Saying please, for everything is what you do for someone who doesn\u2019t know you very well and doesn\u2019t trust you.", "Emotive sounding? We can do it with literally anything. See: trolleyed, plastered, the list goes on \ud83d\ude02", "So you want to borrow things from people without asking for it politely? That's awfully entitled.", "ESH\nYou both have poor manners", "NTA. \n\nAlso doing it to children that are not your own WTAF?", "NTA and she's actually being insanely rude. If a stranger said that to me I would be *pissed.*\n\nThe fact that she had the nerve to say it to your husband about his own thing is baffling. Are you sure she isn't just doing this as some weird smug power move? There's no way she says this to strangers or coworkers without getting in arguments all the time.", "NTA.  \n\nI don\u2019t find it necessary to say please when asking family members/people who live with you, the normal every day small stuff.  Like \u201ccan you pass the salt\u201d \u201ccan you hand me a glass since you are already getting one for yourself\u201d \u201ccan you hand me a pen\u201d sorta things. The little things that are frequently everyday stuff.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking for a favor, something out of their normal routine, then definitely add a please.  Like \u201cim too tired to do X chore today, can you please do it?\u201d \u201cCan you stop at the store on your way home and get ice cream please?", "yep! I am originally slavic language speaking and on the rare occasion i encounter someone like this they are usually so uptight and not actually caring, polite or generous IN SPIRIT which is what counts", "Exactly. I can see where she\u2019s upset with her friend constantly correct in her, however, the fact that people these days seem to forgot to say please all the time really bothers me. And especially if they\u2019re doing that in front of children, because I think children should be taught good manners. But maybe I\u2019m just old and it\u2019s a generational thing.", ">Doesn\u2019t add up to the fact that you do not say \u201cplease\u201d, and that is also not good etiquette.\n\nUm, sure it is. If you ask for something politely, that's good manners. You don't have to say please to be polite-there are lots of ways to express good etiquette, and asking for something instead of demanding it is one way. And if the other person is satisfied with a polite request that doesn't include a \"please\" then there's no issue.", "Seems pretentious to ask my spouse to Please  pass me the remote. Please pass me the salt. Please everything I will ever say.  Edit: Prententious"]}
