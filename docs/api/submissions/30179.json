We chose the name Caelan for him. The name is inspired by my husband being Irish and my family being of Irish descent (and the two of us have Irish names, he's Ruairi and I'm Sinead). My sister has a problem with the name we chose because of an ex of hers. His name was Kaylen but he said it like Kai-lin. However everyone else used the pronunciation we want to use for our son and the pronunciation used in Ireland. I never even thought of my sister's ex. Especially because my sister's ex never said it that way so we used the pronunciation he did. It was my sister who heard the Caelan pronunciation when she was with him.\n\nHe cheated on her and that's where her issues come in.\n\nI'll be honest that I almost have nothing to do with my sister. I only saw her a couple of weeks ago for the first time in maybe 2 years. The name was being discussed by my family (we're open about the name and don't really care about other people's thoughts on the name generally). Us not being close is another reason I never thought of her ex when we were choosing a name. My sister brought it up and was like omg how did nobody think of my ex. None of my family saw the connection until she spelled it out to us. She said I shouldn't use the name and to think about her. I told her the name was set in stone. She asked me how she was meant to feel about that and why didn't I get her blessing first. I told her I never made the connection and also pointed out that we don't talk or see each other. She said it shouldn't matter. My husband told her it absolutely does because she's hardly part of our lives and I shouldn't have to run and ask her permission for something like this.\n\nAfter the family dinner my sister texted me every day for a week about it and she told me I'm being insensitive and to think about her feelings here. My dad called me up then and told me to find a different name so my sister will shut up about it because she's venting to them about how awful I am and doesn't want to hear them say it's not not awful for me to choose the name. He said it will make life more peaceful and that should matter. I told dad I really didn't want to. He said fine.\n\nThen my sister told me I was the biggest turd and I should be fucking ashamed I am putting a name before our sisterhood. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698939666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m6c75/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_change_my_sons_name_for/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is your child. You and your husband can name them whatever you agree on. If you like it, that's all that matters.

You're not close enough for it to be a genuine issue, so the only conclusion I can draw is that she's got a little main character syndrome going on and starting a battle of wills over the name is giving her a storyline.", "NTA.\n\nDon't negotiate with terrorists. A name is just a name and unless you're one of those people that names their kid like it's a vanity license plate, there are going to be hundreds to thousands of other people in the world with the same name.

I had to work to turn my association with August around in my head so I could enjoy my wedding and the weeks leading up to it.

Is she demanding and controlling in other ways?\n\nBoyfriends will come and boyfriends will go.  This is your child, a new family member.", "Lie and tell her you will reconsider using that name. And then use it anyway, because you \u201cchanged your mind\u201d after the baby was born. When she she asks-and you know she *will*. \n\nNTA you can name your baby anything you want.
