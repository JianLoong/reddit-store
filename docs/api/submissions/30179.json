I only saw her a couple of weeks ago for the first time in maybe 2 years.

None of my family saw the connection until she spelled it out to us. She said I shouldn't use the name and to think about her. I told her the name was set in stone. She asked me how she was meant to feel about that and why didn't I get her blessing first. I told her I never made the connection and also pointed out that we don't talk or see each other. She said it shouldn't matter. My husband told her it absolutely does because she's hardly part of our lives and I shouldn't have to run and ask her permission for something like this.\n\nAfter the family dinner my sister texted me every day for a week about it and she told me I'm being insensitive and to think about her feelings here. My dad called me up then and told me to find a different name so my sister will shut up about it because she's venting to them about how awful I am and doesn't want to hear them say it's not not awful for me to choose the name. He said it will make life more peaceful and that should matter. I told dad I really didn't want to.

You are carrying another human for 9 months, who will then come out of YOUR body and its HER who has to grant permission on the name you chose????!!!!!!  She needs to get over herself and keep her away from your baby that she will resent because he will remind her of her ex.  What a jerk she is!  Baby names should be decided by the parents and everyone else should keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA\n\nI saw a show (Party of Five) where the oldest son and his gf got pregnant and the son wanted to name the baby after his mom, who'd died (along with dad) a year earlier, leaving him to care for his 4 siblings...\n\nGf objected because mom's name was the same as a girl who bullied her in high school... 10 years earlier... he was flabbergasted... \n\nPS They did name her after mom, gf immediately called her mom's name at birth, happy ending.\n\nI thought this was so stupid, that no one would really do something like this... guess I was wrong lol", "NTA - They're two totally different names that sound alike, and this just seems like a way for your sister to make the baby about her. Unless she's still hopelessly hung up over the guy, it's kind of weird to be so fixated on it.\n\nTell her the baby's name is Kevin. Just call him \"Lil Kev\" when she's around. lol", "NTA - when will people realise, that until that baby is in your arms, the name should be on a list & a secret \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not pronounced the same?  Then it's literally a different name.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a narcissistic runny turd.", "NTA. Nobody owns a name. And since it's your baby you get to decide what the name is. You could even name every baby you ever have the same name, it is nobody's business but your own. Your sister sounds like she thinks everything should be about her.

They are speaking after TWO years", "NTA \n\nYour sister is putting the name between the \u2018sisterhood\u2019. This is absurd", "NTA \n\nShe's a giant turd for pinning her emotional baggage over a former sexual partner onto her unborn nephew. She may continue to let her life revolve around a guy who cheated on her, but that's not your problem.\n\nYou should tell her it's sad that she is so caught up in her ex that she cannot see how immature and idiotic she's being trying to make a connection where there isn't one and turning into a martyr when you don't cave to her craziness.", "NTA. fuck her couch\u2026", "NTA. What is it with people and getting all bothered over what someone else names their kid?? Your kid. Your choice. If you want to name him Snuffleupagus, you can.", "NTA.  Does she really think that you need to run the name of your baby by her for her consent?  It's your baby, and you can name him whatever you like.  You should counter her texts with \"Now it's to be your nephew's name, so you can have a positive connection with the name. You're welcome\".  \n\nIf she keeps on, just ignore her.

People always be making that excuse for cheating on here, and I'm starting to see a legitimate case in your sister.", "NTA. That's your son, not hers. And like you said, yall aren't even close nor do yall talk, so.....boo hoo. Oh, the entitlement. That girl is so self-centered. Good for you, stand your ground. she didn't help make the baby, so she ain't got a right to the name of the baby.", "NTA! If your sister still has trauma from her ex she should go work on it with a therapist. It\u2019s not fair of her to ask you to change your sons name when you barley see each other and it\u2019s not even the same name. Stick with the name and congrats on the baby boy!!!", "No and your sister seriously needs therapy", "OP, what's your sister's name?  I'm pretty sure it triggers something in me.  And since we go waaay back (like, a solid 7 or 8 seconds) she should honour our friendship and change her name.", "What sisterhood?\n\nJust block her and be done with it. Sounds like your life would only be improved.\n\nTell your parents that you're not discussing this again.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe can build a bridge and get over it.", "Your family needs to back off and show you respectm Your sister needs to realize she can't control you even if she enlists your family.\n\nThis is a boubdary issue, and if you dont hold firm, they will continue to get into your business.

Your sister is acting crazy. It's your kid, name him whatever you want. It's a cool name, btw. She will either get over it or not. Up to her.", "Sorry, I am stuck on how to pronounce the two names. Any help?", "NTA", "Nta  sisterhood?

Nothing will change and it's not like she was trying to be close to to you either way.\n\nYour dad is an a**hole he shouldn't be asking you to change the name just to make his life easier because he's tired of listening to his adult daughter throw a tantrum. He can tell her to knock it out and stop complaining to them because it's not the same name. \n\nStand your ground your sister is ridiculous.", "Nta she is super hyped about it now and it's giving her something to thrive on or live for because apparently she likes drama... She will fade into the background again just like she has before.. don't go base any life decisions off of her attitude", "NTA. This is the equivalent of your sister not wanting you to name your son James, because an ex-boyfriend named Jason cheated on her once.", "NTA. Name your baby whatever you want. I guarantee she will.", "NTA. Block your sister. She sounds awful. It\u2019s a different name and pronounced differently. Your dad should be on your side. I get that he is sick of hearing about it but if this is the name you like, there\u2019s no reason you should need to change it. It\u2019s a good name. Congrats to you & your husband!", "NTA. You never see your sister so what sisterhood is there? \n\nPersonally, I would not choose a name that has been heavily slandered by family as it sounds like bad luck and there are millions of names out there but that's just me, you can do what you want. \n\nI can see how it might be harder for sister to have a strong family relationship with your child with that name or to be a proud aunt, but it doesn't sound like you like her much anyway, so there probably wasn't ever that high a chance of them being close to begin with.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.

Both of you barely speak to each other.\n\nYour sister should be 'fucking ashamed ' for putting her feelings before your sisterhood.

Cut all contact with your sister, she's clearly not worth the drama.", "It's just an excuse for sister making herself the center of attention and forcing others to do her bidding.\n\nDad asking for a name change to keep the peace indicates sister is a boat-rocker who gets off on everyone else doing what's necessary to keep the boat afloat.\n\nOP better draw a line here or she'll be constantly doing sister's bidding.

She's just messed up from dating a Bajoran spiritual leader they can get kinda messy.", "Plus, *who* is putting a name before sisterhood? Not OP; it's sis herself who's doing that. Not to mention, it's a pretty common name so how is sis going through life, meeting people with that name?
