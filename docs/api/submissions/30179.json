I only saw her a couple of weeks ago for the first time in maybe 2 years.

None of my family saw the connection until she spelled it out to us. She said I shouldn't use the name and to think about her. I told her the name was set in stone. She asked me how she was meant to feel about that and why didn't I get her blessing first. I told her I never made the connection and also pointed out that we don't talk or see each other. She said it shouldn't matter. My husband told her it absolutely does because she's hardly part of our lives and I shouldn't have to run and ask her permission for something like this.\n\nAfter the family dinner my sister texted me every day for a week about it and she told me I'm being insensitive and to think about her feelings here. My dad called me up then and told me to find a different name so my sister will shut up about it because she's venting to them about how awful I am and doesn't want to hear them say it's not not awful for me to choose the name. He said it will make life more peaceful and that should matter. I told dad I really didn't want to.
