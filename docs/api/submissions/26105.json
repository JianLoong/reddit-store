He only wants his biological children under his roof, which is why the mum is saying her marriage is being ruined by having to take her child back.", "Yeah, real mom doesn't want her because it will ruin her marriage because step dad doesn't want her. Maybe kid hating OP and step dad can get together, bio parents get back together and boom, Bob's your uncle.", "There is. The whole reason OPs ex wants him to take their daughter is because her new husband doesn't want a kid that isn't his living with them. All of these adults are absolutely horrible, selfish, disgusting people. That poor child.", "Yeah, bio-mom got married and fobbed Eve off on Dave for the sake of her own marriage.", "The mother\u2019s new husband doesn\u2019t want a kid around that isn\u2019t his, which is why the mother told the child\u2019s father that he had to take the kid. 4 adults are playing hot-potato with a 7yo.\n\nAll of these adults are terrible and selfish. OP is terrible and selfish but at least slightly sensible if she leaves Dave no matter where the child lives. Being childfree is not \u201cit\u2019s okay to have your kid around just as long as I never have to do anything\u201d because that attitude will damage the child.", ">And if the op takes Dave back she's horrid too\n\nCompletely agree. And why would anyone want to be with someone that who's shown how terrible they can be to their own child?", "All four adults are AH. If you're decidedly Childfree, you don't marry someone with a child. I'm over the top Childfree, but I would be completely horrified by a parent who tossed out his or her own child just to placate a spouse. It's fine to not want kids but how can you possibly respect a parent who intentionally and willingly gets rid of a child that s/he created?"]}
