I don\u2019t know the details but Anna had a crappy father which caused her to fear men. She\u2019s better now but signs of male anger still freak her out sometimes.\n\nAnyways, my ex and I share a 19 year old daughter, Jaz.\n\nJaz and her father were never especially close but they treat each other with respect. She only sees her dad for a week every month but she likes her dad\u2019s family.\nAnyways, Jaz was at her dad\u2019s for like 5 hours when my ex called me to pick Jaz up.\n\nTurns out she invited her boyfriend over and they both decided to prank Anna. It was a cruel prank knowing her history with her father but Jaz and her boyfriend found it hilarious. Anna was inconsolable and her kids called their dad because of how upset she was. \n\nI was horrified but kept my cool to listen to Jaz\u2019s side. But when I picked her up she was like \u201comg it was just a joke and it was -bf\u2019s- idea. Besides, Anna\u2019s grown and her dad\u2019s been dead so what\u2019s the big deal\u201d\n\nI asked her if she decided to do the prank knowing how Anna would react. She argued with me on this and said \u201cwell it was my bf\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\nI asked her if he forced her? Threatened her? Had to beg her? She said no. I asked her if she laughed, found it funny? She said yeah, no shame. \n\nSo I said \u201cthen it\u2019s your fault just as much as it is your boyfriend\u2019s. If you\u2019re that weak that you do something so hurtful just because your bf said so then clearly I haven\u2019t done my part.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to ignore everything I said except for the \u201cyou\u2019re weak\u201d part. She went \u201cWow mom, now I know what you really think of me.\u201d I told her to cut it out but she said \u201cyou called me weak and insulted me and except me to listen to you? You might be my mom but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to insult me. I\u2019m an adult for fucks sake.\u201d \n\nI told her to act like one then and stop living off of me if she\u2019s such a big adult. She said fine and she called her boyfriend and left. But I feel terrible. I didn\u2019t mean it at all. And now I feel like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called her weak or told her to stop living off of me. I should\u2019ve just told her to cut it out but yeah. I know I can\u2019t take it back but my husband thinks I didn\u2019t say a thing wrong. Neither does my mom (though she does think that I let her go too easily). I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m overwhelmed and confused and my daughter isn\u2019t talking to me and Anna\u2019s apparently not doing too well and I don\u2019t know.", "created_utc": 1680854429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12edsuz/aita_for_implying_my_daughter_is_weak_and_telling/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hope she finds better sometime in the future.", "NTA - If she's an adult, she'll be judged as an adult, especially on her inability to take responsibility and casual cruelty.  You were honest with her, and she chose to take offense, instead of addressing the lack of empathy that brought all this on.\n\nLet her live in the real world a while.

Clearly she is choosing only to respond to that part as a way to change the subject, and paint you as the bad person in the conversation, to disregard what she\u2019s done.", "NTA your daughter is right, she is an adult, which makes her behaviour even more pathetic. There's that old saying \"if all your friends jumped off a cliff, would you do it too?\" evidently your daughter would, and it wouldn't take much convincing either.\n\nJaz knew what Anna's reaction would be, that's why she went along with the prank in the first place, she is not oblivious to Anna's trauma. Your daughter needs to grow up and she needs to grow a new spine while she's at it, if she's so easily swayed by her shitty boyfriends hurtful ideas.", "Your daughter was completely responsible for the prank. Her boyfriend could only have known about Anna's trauma if she told him \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if she's the one that actually planned it, blamed it on him and then attacked you when you called her out on her reprehensible behavior.\n\nShe's an adult, pack her stuff and let her do adulting for awhile.\n\nListen to your mom and don't let your daughter manipulate you with undeserved guilt. \n\nBe ready for her to blame everything bad that happens as a result of her choices on you - stay strong. Tell her you won't support her again in any way until she sincerely apologizes to Anna.", "Your daughter is a bully.  Calling her weak was complimentary compared with the other completely accurate things you could have said about her.\n\nJaz is jumping on the word \"weak\" and how much you insulted her to try to deflect attention from the very ugly, cruel thing she did.  \n\nIgnore her manipulation.  Hold your ground.  Continue to give her the message that what she and her BF did is completely unacceptable, completely cruel, and appalls you.  \n\nShe's leaving.  Swell. Don't let her back until she apologizes to Anna.  Preferably both in writing and in person, with a clear explanation of how she understands that what she did to Anna was cruel, and wrong, and not amusing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I see your pain, but time for your daughter to grow up. You seemed on point with what you said.", "Coulda made a better choice of words, but it sounds like Jaz found something that would help her weasel out of her responsibility in the whole ordeal. Nta.

She left because she knows she\u2019s an asshole and is trying to manipulate you to make herself feel better.  Frankly, Jaz\u2019s behavior is a little scary. Playing a cruel joke and showing no empathy or regret is really unsettling. I just hope she pulls her head out of her ass and apologizes to Anna.", "NTA. She took the 'weak' part out of context; you were making a point. She is the one who blew this out of proportions and made a parent-daughter talk (about pranks and not hurting the traumatized on purpose - so basically about being a responsible adult) into an insult to her.", "NTA  - honestly, you are supporting this person who seems to have zero respect for anyone but her dad. The fact that you are so kind and open about the fact that your hubs ex is a great person and you really show respect for her, shows just what kind of person you are.\n\nNo one should be pranked when everyone knows their history is not so great.\n\nI think you did the right thing. \n\nYou are really nice and kind person, too bad it is being overlooked by a 'weak' and dare I say, spoiled sounding, brat.\n\nIf she was so easily swayed, then yes, she is weak, and maybe feels she has to be so submissive to the bf not to lose them. Again, weakness.", "NTA. Jaz did something horrible and hurtful.  She is weak, and cruel, and not one bit sorry about hurting a family member deeply.  She deserved everything you said, and more.  I would be horrified and dismayed if my child did something like this.  Let her see what being an adult is really about when she has to support herself.  Maybe it will help her grow up and become a decent human.", "INFO: Does Jaz have a history of bullying, being manipulative, refusing to take responsibility, disregarding other's feelings, etc.?", "NTA at all, I'm sorry this happened *virtual hug \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA. Listen. You are 100 percent right. Doing something that can cause such pain to another person is not ok. She needed to feel that shame. Where is your empathy, child? The boyfriend sounds like bad news, but at this point, there isn't anything you can really do. But! you struck a nerve, and that's where I'm going with this. You lit a *fire* in her. That word 'weak' doesn't sit right with this generation. They can't believe the audacity to consider they are weak. In some ways, they are, but that's simply because of the lack of life lived, not what they can handle. But we forget these kids grew up so much differently than we did. 1999 truly was the last greatest year. We live in a dystopian world to these kids.\n\nNow. Here is where you can redeem yourself. Give her space to *see*. But support her with all the love you have for her. Be her silent cheerleader and also show support in her. Remind her that you are always there for her, but keep whatever boundary you feel comfortable with her. I didn't really move away from home until I was 33. Lol I had it made and I was an asshole. I *see* now as a 40 year old. I hope for your daughter's sake she figures out her path sooner than me. Don't worry momma, there is an ebb and flow with everything. As long as you follow love and Light you will find that peaceful balance.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
