She\u2019s better now but signs of male anger still freak her out sometimes.\n\nAnyways, my ex and I share a 19 year old daughter, Jaz.\n\nJaz and her father were never especially close but they treat each other with respect. She only sees her dad for a week every month but she likes her dad\u2019s family.\nAnyways, Jaz was at her dad\u2019s for like 5 hours when my ex called me to pick Jaz up.\n\nTurns out she invited her boyfriend over and they both decided to prank Anna. It was a cruel prank knowing her history with her father but Jaz and her boyfriend found it hilarious. Anna was inconsolable and her kids called their dad because of how upset she was. \n\nI was horrified but kept my cool to listen to Jaz\u2019s side. But when I picked her up she was like \u201comg it was just a joke and it was -bf\u2019s- idea. Besides, Anna\u2019s grown and her dad\u2019s been dead so what\u2019s the big deal\u201d\n\nI asked her if she decided to do the prank knowing how Anna would react. She argued with me on this and said \u201cwell it was my bf\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\nI asked her if he forced her? Threatened her? Had to beg her? She said no. I asked her if she laughed, found it funny? She said yeah, no shame. \n\nSo I said \u201cthen it\u2019s your fault just as much as it is your boyfriend\u2019s.

You might be my mom but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to insult me. I\u2019m an adult for fucks sake.\u201d \n\nI told her to act like one then and stop living off of me if she\u2019s such a big adult. She said fine and she called her boyfriend and left. But I feel terrible. I didn\u2019t mean it at all. And now I feel like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called her weak or told her to stop living off of me. I should\u2019ve just told her to cut it out but yeah. I know I can\u2019t take it back but my husband thinks I didn\u2019t say a thing wrong.

That word 'weak' doesn't sit right with this generation. They can't believe the audacity to consider they are weak. In some ways, they are, but that's simply because of the lack of life lived, not what they can handle. But we forget these kids grew up so much differently than we did. 1999 truly was the last greatest year. We live in a dystopian world to these kids.\n\nNow. Here is where you can redeem yourself. Give her space to *see*. But support her with all the love you have for her. Be her silent cheerleader and also show support in her. Remind her that you are always there for her, but keep whatever boundary you feel comfortable with her. I didn't really move away from home until I was 33. Lol I had it made and I was an asshole. I *see* now as a 40 year old. I hope for your daughter's sake she figures out her path sooner than me. Don't worry momma, there is an ebb and flow with everything.
