She only sees her dad for a week every month but she likes her dad\u2019s family.\nAnyways, Jaz was at her dad\u2019s for like 5 hours when my ex called me to pick Jaz up.\n\nTurns out she invited her boyfriend over and they both decided to prank Anna. It was a cruel prank knowing her history with her father but Jaz and her boyfriend found it hilarious. Anna was inconsolable and her kids called their dad because of how upset she was. \n\nI was horrified but kept my cool to listen to Jaz\u2019s side. But when I picked her up she was like \u201comg it was just a joke and it was -bf\u2019s- idea.

But I feel terrible. I didn\u2019t mean it at all. And now I feel like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called her weak or told her to stop living off of me. I should\u2019ve just told her to cut it out but yeah. I know I can\u2019t take it back but my husband thinks I didn\u2019t say a thing wrong.

That word 'weak' doesn't sit right with this generation. They can't believe the audacity to consider they are weak. In some ways, they are, but that's simply because of the lack of life lived, not what they can handle. But we forget these kids grew up so much differently than we did. 1999 truly was the last greatest year. We live in a dystopian world to these kids.\n\nNow. Here is where you can redeem yourself. Give her space to *see*. But support her with all the love you have for her. Be her silent cheerleader and also show support in her. Remind her that you are always there for her, but keep whatever boundary you feel comfortable with her. I didn't really move away from home until I was 33. Lol I had it made and I was an asshole. I *see* now as a 40 year old. I hope for your daughter's sake she figures out her path sooner than me. Don't worry momma, there is an ebb and flow with everything.

No matter the argument/subject, they hang onto one comment and make it all about that. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating because if we did it back they wouldn\u2019t accept it from us.

If necessary, apologise for saying she was but reiterate that her behaviour and choices were at that time.  It\u2019s best to focus on behaviour and avoid \n\n\u201cyou are\u2026.\u201d \n\ncomments. Always try to couch them as \n\n\u201cyour behaviour was\u2026\u201d. \n\nIf the pattern of behaviour continues then perhaps I\u2019d phrase it along the lines of \n\n\u201cYou are making continual choices and acting in ways that are\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d \n\nThen perhaps look at why this is - is she unhappy/controlled/lacking empathy/miserable etc etc. I know as a late teenager I was a dickhead.

It doesn\u2019t bring out the best in teens that\u2019s for sure. \n\nI now work in a caring and practical role in oncology, have piles of empathy and compassion and am kind. (There are lots of things I hate about myself but those are my good points). But as a teenager I certainly could\u2019ve been selfish and unkind and lacked empathy. In fact, I was an arsehole at times. Not to the extent of bullying but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have cared about someone\u2019s trauma or even considered what that meant - yes if it was my friend but not if it was an older relative.  I too might have said the comment \u2018but he died years ago\u2019. They just don\u2019t get it unless they\u2019ve had similar devastating trauma and I think that may apply to lots of adults too - and it\u2019s fortunate for her then, that she doesn\u2019t get it - if you look at it like that. \n\nSo don\u2019t worry too much. But you did really well, you weren\u2019t too harsh.  I think you\u2019re in for a bit of a bumpy path.

You know the old saying hurt people hurt people well I think this may be the case here to the extreme.

She is embarrassed that you called her out on her behavior, and getting upset and insulted by what you said was a distraction to try and get you to back down. You didn\u2019t. You called her bluff, and now she\u2019s sulking. Stand your ground .

Good job", "If someone has a mental breakdown because of a prank you pulled and you see nothing wrong with that and don't immediately apologize, there's something wrong with you. Op should not forgive her easily. When she wants to come back to stay with op, you shouldn't allow her to. If she's in a desperate situation, stick to your decision and tell her that if she doesn't apologize, you won't be taking her back. If you call to apologize to her, she'd think what she did wasn't a big deal and that she could do it again.\n\nNote: She is weak. And incredibly immature. Coming from a 15-year-old.", "NTA. You were right. She is either weak or of bad character, and her boyfriend is the same. I\u2019m sorry. She needed a sharp shock like this. It might take some time, but this might be only way she looks at and reforms herself.", "NTA\n\nYou said absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nYour daughter willingly helped her boyfriend pull a nasty cruel attack on her stepmother that she very likely knew was going to have extreme negative consequences. This assumes she and her boyfriend are aware of Anna\u2019s history. \n\nShe was all it wasn\u2019t a big deal, Anna is over reacting, everybody should just chill and also threw boyfriend under the bus as it was his idea.  \n\nDid they make a video of what happened?!? \n\nWhen you pointed out she was definitely responsible and she was weak for going along with being so cruel to someone like Anna she got offended because she is an adult and how dare you insult her.  And by doing what she did she was using your home as a refuge to escape dealing with her father\u2019s reaction. So yep living off you.  \n\nNow she is living with her boyfriend and not speaking to you because you were so mean. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. People who want to bully, terrorize and traumatize people under the guise of \u2018oh it\u2019s just a prank\u2019 need to own their actions.  \n\nI\u2019d go so far as if she has house keys to your or your ex\u2019s house especially is change the locks.  \n\nA true prank is funny. It may SLIGHTLY embarrass the victim but not send them into a meltdown. It should not terrify someone nor should it cause any sort of damage.  \n\nSo let her live her best life with her boyfriend for now until such time until she owns what she did and apologizes sincerely to Anna.   Then she can act like an adult and have an honest discussion with you.", "She decided w/her boyfriend to terrify a woman who\u2019s always been kind and nice, for laughs.

It sounds like she was trying to get out of guilt for the prank by making you the villain.\n\nBut if you didn't really mean she was a weak person, you shouldn't have doubled down by suggesting she move out. I understand it was probably just a heated argument, and you both escalated it. It would be best if you could both apologize to each other. The boyfriend sounds like the real AH here, and it wouldn't be good if she becomes dependent on him after losing your support.", "NTA-Your daughter is a problem. She\u2019s rude and disrespectful and moreover, cruel and insensitive. She needs to apologize to you, her father, and Anna. If not, maybe A LOT of privileges need to go. \n\nTo clarify, she\u2019s basically run away with her BF now? At 16? How old is he??\n\nSorry, I see she\u2019s 19 duh.

Your daughter is not an adult, she is an immature brat.  things like this are not pranks - they are generally mean and nasty, intended to hurt and wound.  I wish people would start viewing them as assault and report them as assaults to the cops, then follow up by taking the pranksters to small claims court to cover their therapist's bills.  But then, the worst \"prank\" I ever pulled was putting candles on my brother's 40th birthday cake that wouldn't blow out.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter took pleasure out of traumatising her Stepmom.\n\nI don't know if she's weak, but she's cruel.", "Your daughter was purposefully malicious and cruel, and you think you shouldn't have told her off?  Maybe if you'd told her off long ago she wouldn't have turned out to be a really awful adult.  Let her go be awful somewhere else.  And actually check in on Anna.  Clearly she's NOT okay, after your daughter victimized her.  YTA for being weak yourself in the face of your daughters cruelty.", "NTA. Your daughter tried to twist your words and manipulate the situation, so she can try to play the victim role", "OP comments that Anna would flinch a lot around the bf when they first met. He KNEW she was scared of him. And I want you to think about what kind of monster would enjoy deliberately escalate that fear for fun, to get off on the power he has over that person instead of doing what he can to minimise it. That kind of person is not going to be in a relationship of equals.\n\nAs for the daughter, I specifically said she should not be excused for her participation, nor should she be allowed to normalise or justify the cruelty. However, weak people do awful things for charismatic monsters all the time. You have extreme examples such as cults to the more pedestrian examples of the thousands of posts on reddit that say their friend/family member did a 180 personality change from loving and kind to justifying all kinds of nastiness to keep their partner's approval/\"love\". The daughter is weak but it is very hard to give up on your kids. OP has to walk a careful line if she doesn't want her daughter successfully isolated from her family.", "My question is, why do you assume it is the bf who is the cruel manipulator and the daughter is the one being manipulated. \n\nYou assume she's the weak one.
