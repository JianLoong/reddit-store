I don\u2019t know the details but Anna had a crappy father which caused her to fear men. She\u2019s better now but signs of male anger still freak her out sometimes.\n\nAnyways, my ex and I share a 19 year old daughter, Jaz.\n\nJaz and her father were never especially close but they treat each other with respect. She only sees her dad for a week every month but she likes her dad\u2019s family.\nAnyways, Jaz was at her dad\u2019s for like 5 hours when my ex called me to pick Jaz up.\n\nTurns out she invited her boyfriend over and they both decided to prank Anna. It was a cruel prank knowing her history with her father but Jaz and her boyfriend found it hilarious. Anna was inconsolable and her kids called their dad because of how upset she was. \n\nI was horrified but kept my cool to listen to Jaz\u2019s side. But when I picked her up she was like \u201comg it was just a joke and it was -bf\u2019s- idea. Besides, Anna\u2019s grown and her dad\u2019s been dead so what\u2019s the big deal\u201d\n\nI asked her if she decided to do the prank knowing how Anna would react. She argued with me on this and said \u201cwell it was my bf\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\nI asked her if he forced her? Threatened her? Had to beg her? She said no. I asked her if she laughed, found it funny? She said yeah, no shame. \n\nSo I said \u201cthen it\u2019s your fault just as much as it is your boyfriend\u2019s.

You might be my mom but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to insult me. I\u2019m an adult for fucks sake.\u201d \n\nI told her to act like one then and stop living off of me if she\u2019s such a big adult. She said fine and she called her boyfriend and left. But I feel terrible. I didn\u2019t mean it at all. And now I feel like maybe I shouldn\u2019t have called her weak or told her to stop living off of me. I should\u2019ve just told her to cut it out but yeah. I know I can\u2019t take it back but my husband thinks I didn\u2019t say a thing wrong.

That word 'weak' doesn't sit right with this generation. They can't believe the audacity to consider they are weak. In some ways, they are, but that's simply because of the lack of life lived, not what they can handle. But we forget these kids grew up so much differently than we did. 1999 truly was the last greatest year. We live in a dystopian world to these kids.\n\nNow. Here is where you can redeem yourself. Give her space to *see*. But support her with all the love you have for her. Be her silent cheerleader and also show support in her. Remind her that you are always there for her, but keep whatever boundary you feel comfortable with her. I didn't really move away from home until I was 33. Lol I had it made and I was an asshole. I *see* now as a 40 year old. I hope for your daughter's sake she figures out her path sooner than me. Don't worry momma, there is an ebb and flow with everything.

No matter the argument/subject, they hang onto one comment and make it all about that. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating because if we did it back they wouldn\u2019t accept it from us. He has autism which makes disagreements and parenting hard because he also has the emotionally maturity of around 13. \n\nAnyway, back to you. You weren\u2019t wrong. She did behave horribly and I would have been angry and disappointed in my kid if they had done that too. I am sure she will come round but it may not happen immediately. In the meantime I\u2019d stay calm, reiterate you love her and she has a home with you.  When (not if!) she brings up the weak comment, rephrase it to say her behaviour was weak, not her. If necessary, apologise for saying she was but reiterate that her behaviour and choices were at that time.  It\u2019s best to focus on behaviour and avoid \n\n\u201cyou are\u2026.\u201d \n\ncomments. Always try to couch them as \n\n\u201cyour behaviour was\u2026\u201d. \n\nIf the pattern of behaviour continues then perhaps I\u2019d phrase it along the lines of \n\n\u201cYou are making continual choices and acting in ways that are\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d \n\nThen perhaps look at why this is - is she unhappy/controlled/lacking empathy/miserable etc etc. I know as a late teenager I was a dickhead. And even worse when I was depressed and felt like a loser. It doesn\u2019t bring out the best in teens that\u2019s for sure. \n\nI now work in a caring and practical role in oncology, have piles of empathy and compassion and am kind. (There are lots of things I hate about myself but those are my good points). But as a teenager I certainly could\u2019ve been selfish and unkind and lacked empathy. In fact, I was an arsehole at times. Not to the extent of bullying but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have cared about someone\u2019s trauma or even considered what that meant - yes if it was my friend but not if it was an older relative.  I too might have said the comment \u2018but he died years ago\u2019. They just don\u2019t get it unless they\u2019ve had similar devastating trauma and I think that may apply to lots of adults too - and it\u2019s fortunate for her then, that she doesn\u2019t get it - if you look at it like that. \n\nSo don\u2019t worry too much. But you did really well, you weren\u2019t too harsh.  I think you\u2019re in for a bit of a bumpy path.
