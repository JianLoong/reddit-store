My wife has a younger sister (26F) who's always been a bit of a free spirit, hopping between jobs and her various passions, which is fine.

She approached us for help, and after discussing it with my wife, we decided to loan her $2,000 from our savings, with the explicit understanding that she would start paying us back in small installments once she got back on her feet. We even had a simple contract drawn up (we didn't hire a lawyer or anything, but it laid out everything), which she signed.\n\nFast forward to now, Sara has a decent job and seems to be doing pretty well. She's making money, going out, even took a small vacation recently. But she hasn't paid back a cent. When I brought it up a few weeks back, she acted surprised and hurt, claiming that the money was a gift and that she's shocked I would even bring it up.\n\nI insisted it was a loan, mentioning the contract, but now she's accusing me of being greedy and materialistic. My wife is torn. She obviously understands the agreement but hates confrontation and is uncomfortable with the tension between everyone. She believes we should let it go to maintain peace, since it's not a crazy large amount of money, but I feel like we're being taken advantage of if we don't settle this right.\n\nNow, family gatherings are little awkward, and I'm sorta being painted as the bad guy for wanting the money back. I didn't think I was wrong, but with everyone's reaction, I'm starting to question myself a little bit too.

Ask the family how you are behaving unreasonably by expecting Sara to honour a contract she freely signed and is now in a position to live up to. Ask them all to explain how Sara is entitled to money that *you and your wife* worked for and why it is acceptable for Sara to treat you this way after you were there for her when she needed help.\n\nPut all the facts on the table and put them all on the spot.\n\nAnd never, under any circumstances, loan Sara money again.", "NTA.\n\nI have had to hear, for decades, stories of gripes over one part of my family taking financial advantage over another. here's a solution. If you agree to play Elsa and let it go this time, its with the understanding with your wife, made clear to SIL and family, that you never loan SIL any money ever again no matter the circumstances. Maybe an exception (kept secret between you and your wife) for a life-threatening situation, but other than that... its done, the bank of BIL is closed. Take the loss as a lesson, learn from it, change your behavior moving forward, and move on. \n\nIf SIL doesn't like the sound of that and wants a safety net in future.... well she can either save for it herself, or pay you back - at which point you would potentially be willing to consider lending to her again in the future. \n\nYour choice on how to play it, but stick to whatever route you choose.", "NTA, but you've just learned an awesome lesson about your wife's family.  Never loan them a single dime again, not to any of them.", "NTA. There's a freaking contract. If you let this go, she's only going to ask for money again later", "NTA.  Repeat after me everyone - do NOT loan money to family members (or friends for that matter) unless you are happy to never see it again.  If you must do it, get it in writing.", "I doubt she truly thinks it was a gift. I'm guessing that she feels it should have been a gift because you had money and she needed money. It is astonishing what people can convince themselves of if they really try.\n\nIf you want to be petty, for every future gift-giving occasion, you can give her a gift of forgiving a part of her debt. This would of course not be well received by the people who want you to allow you to be taken advantage of, in order to pretend everyone is all happy and kind and trustworthy.\n\nPerhaps you could tell each person that is nagging at you to just let it go, that you will do so for the sake of family. However, due to all the trouble that this created, because you love your families too much to allow money to ever create such a rift again, that you and your wife can never risk giving family money, and they will have to ask SIL instead.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You have money to go on vacation, you have money to pay back what you know you owe. She signed a contract, she\u2019s an adult. Time to get to adulting.", "The money was a loan and you have the paperwork to prove it. If anyone else in the family interferes or comments, show them the loan paperwork and ask when they will be contributing to the payback. I guarantee they shut up fast as they won't want to pay anything. No TA but don't lend money to friends or family - I know it seems like a nice thing to do but they will always try and screw you.", "She signed a friggin' contract to pay it back. No, NTA.", "NTA but your wife is one. She needs to take your ride and tell her family to leave you alone. She also needs to get the money from her sister. I wonder how much money she has given her without you knowing.", "NTA. I can speak from experience family members like your SIL are the worst. For your own peace of mind you should gift her the signed contract for her next birthday or christmas. But you should also make it perfectly clear that this behavior has cost her any chance of financial help in the future.", "NTA. It's outrageous that she signed that contract and then pretended she thought it was a gift. She's the poster child for ingratitude.", "Your wife needs to handle this so that you are not the bad guy! Your SIL owes you the money and it should be enforced.\n\nOtherwise, a compromise should be reached with your wife that SIL doesn\u2019t receive any birthday or other holiday gifts until the value of $2K has been met! You can just send her an updated statement for her birthday (\u201c$2k - $100 for 35th Birthday. $1900 balance remaining.\u201d)\n\nNTA! This is why money and family don\u2019t mix, but I know hindsight is not helpful", "NTA, SIL needs to repay the loan to \u201cmaintain peace\u201d - she\u2019s trying to emotionally manipulate her way out of this, don\u2019t let her!", "NTA. She's lying, she's spending money freely on vacations and not paying you back. it was never a loan, if she signed a contract saying it's a loan and had a payback schedule then she's openly lying and trying to basically steal money from you. \n\nAnyone siding with her is talking out of their ass. Send them a copy of the contract and say her believing it was a gift and not a loan is a complete lie and you helped her out of a bad spot and now she's lying, manipulating and turning people against you for helping her.", "NTA but she will never pay it back.

SIL doesn't think it's a gift, she's trying to con you with guilt and your wife's noodle spine.\n\nI Guess you have to decide how much you want to maintain IN-LAW peace.  if you do--\"Forgive loan\", if you don't--demand it be repaid.\n\nThat said, I'm petty AF.  Just get her birthday cards/and tuck in a $5 bill(consider 50 bucks off of the debt).  For Christmas-Card/$5 bucks and consider it another 50 bucks off her debt.\n\nit will only take about 20 yrs, but it'll eventually be paid off....  Unless you add in other holidays as it goes.  She gets married...Wedding gift gets card with a tenner and you write off $100?  Baby shower: card--pack of diapers and write off $75.  \n\nDepending on the usual gifting opportunities, you might be able to give her the contract with \"PAID\" written on it after 15 yrs....\n\nAlso, if you do agree to \"forgive\" the debt, don't ever forget and your wife needs to be on same page--there are NO loans ever again(or \"gifts\" for random reasons).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
