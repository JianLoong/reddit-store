My wife has a younger sister (26F) who's always been a bit of a free spirit, hopping between jobs and her various passions, which is fine.

She approached us for help, and after discussing it with my wife, we decided to loan her $2,000 from our savings, with the explicit understanding that she would start paying us back in small installments once she got back on her feet. We even had a simple contract drawn up (we didn't hire a lawyer or anything, but it laid out everything), which she signed.\n\nFast forward to now, Sara has a decent job and seems to be doing pretty well. She's making money, going out, even took a small vacation recently. But she hasn't paid back a cent. When I brought it up a few weeks back, she acted surprised and hurt, claiming that the money was a gift and that she's shocked I would even bring it up.\n\nI insisted it was a loan, mentioning the contract, but now she's accusing me of being greedy and materialistic. My wife is torn. She obviously understands the agreement but hates confrontation and is uncomfortable with the tension between everyone. She believes we should let it go to maintain peace, since it's not a crazy large amount of money, but I feel like we're being taken advantage of if we don't settle this right.\n\nNow, family gatherings are little awkward, and I'm sorta being painted as the bad guy for wanting the money back.

Maybe an exception (kept secret between you and your wife) for a life-threatening situation, but other than that... its done, the bank of BIL is closed. Take the loss as a lesson, learn from it, change your behavior moving forward, and move on. \n\nIf SIL doesn't like the sound of that and wants a safety net in future.... well she can either save for it herself, or pay you back - at which point you would potentially be willing to consider lending to her again in the future. \n\nYour choice on how to play it, but stick to whatever route you choose.", "NTA, but you've just learned an awesome lesson about your wife's family.

This would of course not be well received by the people who want you to allow you to be taken advantage of, in order to pretend everyone is all happy and kind and trustworthy.\n\nPerhaps you could tell each person that is nagging at you to just let it go, that you will do so for the sake of family.

The last one we gave your sister. And next time she can't pay rent, we won't help her. She can go to a public shelter or other family members. But there won't be help from our side.

Don't gift her anything until she makes an honest effort to pay back the loan.  And if and when she does, don't lend her money ever again.  Trust me, Sarah KNOWS it was not a gift.  Your wife believing you should let it go is precisely the reason Sarah has no intention of paying it back.  She knows your wife won't force the issue.  However, at your age, you need to be saving that money for your future, or for your kids should you decide to have kids.

I mean, I wouldn't do it because of the animosity it would breed, but can you imagine OP giving each enabler their bday card saying \"Sara thanks you for this $30 which I'll deduct from her tab.
