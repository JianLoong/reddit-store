We also have bookkeepers and accountants. Our boss doesn't care when we WFH or in the office as long as we get our work done. There are definitely times when we need to be in the office for meetings or mail.\n\nI've been here for four years and had been taken advantage of by people who didn't want to show up to do their office work. I was coming in almost everyday because it made my day go faster. All of a sudden I started getting bombarded by coworkers to do favors so they wouldn't have to come in. \n\nBasically I was using my office time to do their office work. They just came to expect it so I stopped coming in. I never got a thank you or anything. \n\nThose who took advantage of me all had one thing in common - they talked about nothing but their kids. The more they talked about their kids, the more \"crises\" they had that prevented them from coming to the office.\n\nFor example, one coworker talked forever about how her daughter was going to a new school far away. All of a sudden she's emailing me to do favors because she's stuck in traffic picking up her kid (yes on office hours).\n\nAnother example was a coworker talked endlessly about her kid's gymnastics. I start getting calls from her to go through her mail at the office and to scan it because she's at her daughter's gymnastics competition.\n\nThey all acted like I \"knew\" about their kid stuff so it was okay.\n\nAll of that ended when I stopped coming in and it forced them to come in.\n\nMy firm hired a new person and all she talks about is her kid and how she's going through a separation blah blah. It was deja vu. I bluntly told her that she better not call me to do any office favors if she can't come to work because of her kid. She was a bit taken aback but I made my point. I'm happy I did that.\n\nTo be clear, I'm NOT the office assistant. I'm here for two people not 50.\n\nAlso, like 90% of the things that these people talk about are about their kid. Not work, not the weather, etc. They just bring it up all the time.\n\nEveryone else talks about their kids like 10% of the time and the rest is about work. \n\nI'm not a kid hater. I'm actually a single dad with a 8yo son. Only three coworkers know about that and I've been here for 4 years. I may keep my personal life and work life separate but I am way too busy to spend two hours talking about his weekend soccer game.", "created_utc": 1668182756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yseola/aita_for_telling_a_new_employee_not_to_ask_me_for/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand your position because you provided a lot of context in the post. I think your concerns were legitimate and you have every right to refuse to do favors if you don't want to -they are called favors for a reason. \nHowever, it looks like your coworker didn't know about your previous experience, so there was no need to treat her bluntly and this makes you look like TA in this situation. \nIt looks like you may have a hard time refusing to do favors, so you either avoid the situation altogether by not going to the office, or you try to prevent similar situations by acting bluntly before a request has been expressed. Assertive communication is a little hard to master, but it helps to both establish boundaries and keep your freedom.", "YTA, did she ask for a favour? You just assumed and made an ass of yourself.", "YTA\n\nIt is reasonable to say \"sorry, no\" to any requests beyond your job description, provided your bosses are okay with it.\n\nHowever, childcare has been a gawdawful mess since the beginning of the pandemic, with childcare centers closing, workers finding other jobs, etc.  The shortage and crisis is real.  And it is not, in any way, an attack on you that these parents are in crisis.  It's their problem to solve, but treating it as an attack on you is AH, when they are simply desperate to find a way to simultaneously do their jobs and care for their kids in a situation radically different from what existed when they chose to have kids. \n\nJust politely say \"sorry, I can't, I'm busy.\"  Don't get upset by situations beyond anyone's control and blame it on them.\n\nAnd don't attack new co-workers based on the problems of others.", "ESH\n\nYour coworkers suck because they take advantage of you, and have gotten comfortable to a point where they just assume it's okay to do it. It's an environment similar to what you see in high schools where people depend on the one motivated person in the group, then levy all their problems/duties on them; it sucks.\n\nYou suck because your first impression to a new hire was simply \"Don't ask me for favors\" before they even ran into a situation where they would. The way you went about it gave off a sort of \"This person already doesn't like me\" vibe, which can be damaging to an employee's morale from the get-go. \n\nThe only one that didn't suck here was the new hire because they just walked into the situation not knowing what was going on. \n\nWhile I understand your situation of being somewhat jaded towards people complaining about their kids and the responsibilities of having to parent/adult, that's no excuse to take it out on someone who you don't know the full story on yet. I would hope as a new hire they understand that they can't just skirt by and expect you to take the burden for them already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
