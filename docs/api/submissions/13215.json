I haven't cheated ever.", "I used a website to get a free DIY divorce agreement", "My thoughts exactly!", "Omg classic", "She's just a really disrespectful person.\n\nLike you know those people who are rude to servers and have a sarcastic or belittling comment about everything they do? That's my ex wife. She was like that 24/7.", "\u201cHey Reddit, I ghosted my wife of 8 years, but I left a note explaining as little as I possibly could. AITA?\u201d\n\nYes. Yes you are. YTA.", "She doesn't really yell or anything but she talks down to me and talks over me all the time so I just figured having a discussion wouldn't be productive. I also have 0% interest in trying to work things out anyways.", "No, she's not nice to me but I wouldn't say things were abusive.", "Yes. Things started to get rocky 6 months in to dating but I very much loved her. We moved in together after about a year. To be honest, I wasn't ready and she pressured me but at the time I figured I would try and take the next step and if it didn't work out I would leave. Little did I know housing costs were going to shoot up and suddenly I couldn't afford to live on my own anymore. So I felt trapped for a long time.\n\nAlso as soon as we moved in together it was like some demon came out. Like literally the day we moved in together.", "Lol to him thinking he only has to pay 3 months of mortgage. Man, I hope she gets a good lawyer. He\u2019s gonna be paying for two places a lot longer than that!!", "She can\u2019t read your mind. You should be able to communicate at your big age.", "You might wanna add a little more info? Was it a rocky relationship? Was she shitty to you? Right now all we know is you practically ghosted her after 8 years. It's laid out to make you the asshole immediately", "Dude NOBODY in their right mind will expect divorce on a fridge note. Even with their head up on the moon. Useless she was abusive and you were concerned for your own safety (not the case form other OP post) you TALK to people in their face.", "YTA for this comment alone! \n\nNo wonder you fail at all communication", "So you told her you were unhappy? You were distant? Never said \"I love you\" or were intimate the last few months?\n\nOr did you pretend to be in a happy marriage while you prepared your \"escape\"?", "You're a coward.", "As someone who has initiated a divorce, you don\u2019t get to decide financial obligations through a sticky note. That\u2019s decided during mediation and legally enforced. YTA for that alone. As it\u2019s a shared marital asset it will bite you in the ass behaving this way.", "So you are a coward who thinks he is so above everyone else that you don\u2019t even owe your wife an explanation why you are leaving her? Don\u2019t even have the courage to tell her that she \u201chas her head up her ass\u201d? YTA and a big one.", "YTA- You're the only one with their head up their a$$ if you think leaving a fridge note is an acceptable way to end your marriage.", "Nope. He's still on the hook for the mortgage whether he lives on the property or not. He could be paying it for months if they can't reach an agreement.", "Yes he would. If his name is on the mortgage, he has to pay for the house unless he wants his credit totally destroyed and for it to be foreclosed on.", "He won't be legally allowed to stop paying until there is a settlement which will take longer than three months. You can't just unilaterally decide to stop paying a debt that's in your name lol. No divorce is going to be done that fast", "I hope she charges you for all the therapy she'd going to need for that.", "The way you acted/are acting the problem wasn\u2019t her, it\u2019s you. I really hope she finds someone better than you.\n\nYou on the other hand- I hope you have a hard wake up call figuring out other people are not put on this earth to please you. JFC are you 7?! Like are you sure you\u2019re a grown ass adult? Because big boys use their words and take responsibility for their actions instead of blaming everyone else for being a miserable coward.", "YTA your are disgusting and a coward!", "Why do you hate her so much?", "We\u2019re already tired of dealing with you, but we\u2019re at least talking to you about it. And we\u2019re fucking strangers.", "YTA. You leaving her so she can find someone better (and boy is that bar low) is probably the best thing that\u2019ll ever happen to her but holy shit did you go about it in the worst way possible.", "Look, you only live once. Being unhappy is the worst thing you can do to yourself and life will have its relationship casualties wether you\u2019re a saint, or a sinner. Who cares if you\u2019re an asshole, it\u2019s not what you want. Done is done.", "Well that's big of you, signing a few bits of paper lol.\n\nBe honest here, you know you have been a coward in the way you have gone about this. Not even been willing to tell her to her face. You've just packed you bags and ran.", "What if she doesn\u2019t want to sell the house? What you are doing by ghosting her is just awful. Be an adult and end the relationship like an adult. YTA", "Are you serious?", "Yeah you've pushed it a bit far with this reply. This story is all bullshit.\n\nStill TA though, on principle.", "Oh- you\u2019re making this up.", "Maybe your wife is better off without you...", "So are you!", "You gotta give more than just \u201cshe was a dick\u201d. Because honestly, you sound like a total tool. I could be wrong, but your responses have not helped your case.", "The irony of this comment. YTA.", "Yeah and she's hardly incentivised to help him out is she? He's going to be paying that for longer than 3 months lol .", "I hope he has to. He is an AH.", "Isn\u2019t his obligation to plan the partners life after getting divorced. But you do you.", "I saved enough to keep paying for 6 months.\n\nI told her 3 because she's going to drag this out for 4 or 5.", "There's an INFO post already smdh", "I feel like this should be documented or something", "I feel pretty strongly that she would say the same.", "But you have someone on deck", "Good luck with getting her to sign it.", "Lol. Lmao. I hope she gets an absolute shark of a lawyer.", "And you are an emotionally cut off person.\n\nLike you know those people who walk out on relationships without bothering to give any kind of explanation to anybody and then expects the other person to sell the jointly owned house and find another one within three months, in this economy? That\u2019s you. And I expect your lack of any communication was 24/7.", "You obviously did something to deserve it. Look at you! Enough said", "Okay, so divorce wasnt an AH move. I get being around disrespectful people can be exhausting. But I still think leaving a note on the fridge and disappearing was not okay. If she was outright verbally abusive to you, then this would have been justified. Maybe you can meet her over coffee and clear it up? You dont need to make it too long, just let her know you were unhappy.", "Ok, NTA", "You may have 0 interest in working things out, but you owe it to her to look her in the eye when you break up with her.\nEspecially if the breakup is a divorce.\n\nYTA.", "Bro you are a grown man wtf lmao that\u2019s such a middle school way of thinking wtf.", "YTA. And a coward. And emotionally stunted. The list goes on...", "I would talk down to you, too. Lol", "Then YTA.\n\nYou gave yourself 5 months to get out, and have given her 3 months of mortgage payments from you to sort everything out? \n\nThere is absolutely no reason why you needed to blindside her so blatantly, and her life has changed because of your selfishness.\n\nPick up the damn phone and communicate", "So why did you marry her then?", "What do you mean by \"demon\"? Give us some more info because I just responded that you abandoned your wife because it seems like you just felt like the marriage wasn't for you for no reason. Please explain why you fell out of love.", "If you loved her at one point, the kind and compassionate thing to do is talk to her to give her some sort of sense of closure. Note on the fridge doesn\u2019t do that. \n\nIf you are adamantly opposed because of how she behaves, please consider writing her a detailed letter that gives her specific reasons, like the one you gave me and a couple other people. This will, at least in the long term give her a concrete sense of what went wrong, so she isn\u2019t left wondering. I encourage you to do this even if you think the reasons should be obvious to her.\n\nI think there\u2019s a possibility here that you were subject to emotional abuse, based on one of your comments on her behavior, and I\u2019ll probably get downvoted to all hell for saying that, but I\u2019ve known men that were verbally and emotionally abused and they snapped and just walked away, a your dead to me kind of approach.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case you owe her nothing and good for you for taking control.", "So according to what you just said and your own timeline you've been unhappy for 7 years, married her anyway and then ghosted her? I can't even... wow that's pretty shitty.", "Things were rocky but apparently she felt like everything was good", "You might want to tell that to the judge that said quite the opposite in my divorce", "If he's cool with his credit being trashed thats on him.", "Now, this is devils advocate based on my personal situation with houses being bought by married couples and who has to pay up in the event of divorce court.\n\nLegally, when two people are on a loan, it doesn't matter if one person backs out, the banks will look at you and say \"I don't care he backed out on an agreement, you can pay up in or lose said loan\" now when a court gets involved in a divorce like this, the judge will then decide which party, if one at all or both, will pay said expenses. Up until the judge makes a decision, he doesn't HAVE to pay those bills at all, even if it effects his credit (yes I know not paying for loans is theft, but that's another topic)", "My CONTESTED DIVORCE WITH CHILDREN is a clear example of how you're very wrong. It was from first filing to finalized, 7 months. To the day. Now, I'm not saying that it happens all the time or even many states do this. My ex husband's name was on everything mine was. He stopped paying bills and the mortgage after we split. Guess what happened when that was brought up to the judge? Nothing except \"he's not living there?\" \"No you're honor\" \"ok\", he needs to pay his share or remove his name, he has x number of days to do this from xyz date\" And that was that. Now, two years later because he doesn't want to comply with court order, I have to go back and have the courts take time and money not only from tax payers but also from my own pocket to write up a legal document to have his name removed.", "500 upvotes if I could.", "Can I give you a thousand up votes?!", "Wish I had an award to give you", "I spent a lot of my life being unhappy so everyone around me stayed happy and I kind of just decided I'm done with all that", "She can buy me out if she wants. Honestly at this point I would just walk away if she wants to just take over the payments", "The OP's response makes me question the veracity of this story.", "No it's not his responsibility to sort her life out. But he's told her that he will pay the shared debt for 3 months only and made the decision for her that she should sell the house in that time.\n\nIt's up to the divorce lawyers around division of assets as to what he should or should not be paying, not some line in a break up note", "Comment straight out of r/RomanticAdvice", "Mate, she's going to drag it out for a lot longer than that if you refuse her the courtesy of a conversation. I'd be making things as difficult for you as possible.", "If your name is on the mortgage and it was the marital home, you might want to talk to a lawyer", "Do you blame her for dragging it out? You've left with your things without anything but a note. You owe her a conversation and explanation at the very least. The way you've behaved is appalling. Oh and YTA.", "You realize you don\u2019t just get to opt out of a mortgage you signed right?  She can keep it indefinitely and you\u2019re on the hook.", "Nah, someone ruined it lol", "If she didn't before. She definitely does now", "I do not. I am not ready for another relationship", "Cause hes stupid and plays the victim of poor me poor me. He couldn't do any better obviously", "Maybe because you failed to communicate your feelings? Not everyone can read minds.", "If she thought the relationship was good then she deserves to know where it went wrong. You're leaving her completely empty handed here.", "You told her you loved her until you left.", "She felt everything was good because you lied to her and let her believe that.", "That's after you saw the judge, but until that happens, he's still liable for the payments because it is in his name. If the judge decides he can take the name off the mortgage, then he'll no longer be responsible for the payments.", "We all hope you didn\u2019t left in the middle of the night with a note on the fridge. I think THAT is the AH move. Also having months to plan this on the financial and logistic side and not giving your former partner the same curtesy.", "Look, we've all got our own versions of this story. Mine involves two friends who eventually managed to sell after 7 months of disagreements and only once she agreed to not petition for child support. \n\nRegardless, this isn't a legal sub. Whether he legally can default after 90 days doesn't really have much relevance here.", "I care about my credit but my wife is on another level. She is OBSESSED with her credit score so I'm kind of banking on winning this game of chicken with her.", "Bro, the hell does that have to do with anything here. You don't have to stay with her. Divorce, if that's what you want, is fair and square. Even not bothering with counseling or anything, even if it's a long term relationship\u2014if you're done, you're done.\n\nYour problem is that you refused to communicate this to your wife, at any point, and then just wrote a note to leave her. This isn't about making people happy. It's about being an adult and giving someone else the respect that both of you deserve, regardless of the situation. You say she is not abusive, which is the only option that would have justified this.\n\nYTA and a coward. Grow up and talk to her face to face.", "Yeah, their comments are so over the top that it must be made up.", "Yeah I\u2019m fully aware of that. Just said he isn\u2019t obligated to plan her life.", "I honestly don't even care about the house. She can sell it and keep 100% I am just done and want a fresh start", "More than one now...", "she deserved to know much sooner too", "Go to the bank. Get a loan with your legal married spouse.

Sorry, that's a risk you took when you took a loan out together, it's still owed\" it definitely will NOT be \"ok, well go after him for his half and you keep paying on yours\" or \"that's OK! We will take his name off and put yours on\"\n\nThe last two could very well happen, AFTER a judge orders it.\n\nLike I said. Go tell the judge in my divorce case what you said. See the answers you get.", "I think he left the note on the fridge also\u2026", "Oh, so you're petty as well as dishonest. Great...", "Being married to you sounds like a nightmare. Best of luck to your wife. YTA", "THIS! 100% THIS!", "That takes time to figure out in a divorce. Does she earn enough to buy you out? Is it ready for sale immediately? In my country even once listed with an agent it takes a couple of weeks for the first home open, and once an offer received a further 60ish days for settlement.\n\nYou picking a time frame means nothing with reality. You deciding what happens next in her life is nothing either, as a divorce and settlement of assets takes time. \n\nI strongly recommend that you get a lawyer who lives in reality, because you seem to think that you deciding you are done means everything", "Sounds like he is.\n\nIt's funny how people are down voting me when all I'm doing is saying what a judge and bank would say."]}
