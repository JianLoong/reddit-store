{"id": 17985, "submission_id": "13ppbw7", "title": "AITA for not inviting our niece to our wedding", "selftext": "My partner (35M) and I (33F) are getting married this summer. We're having a pretty small wedding - around 40 people, and have decided to make it no kids so everyone can enjoy themselves. \n\nMy partner Harry* has a brother (Wes) who has a daughter (Edith) who will be 15 months when our wedding comes. Wes and his wife (Rita) are deeply offended that not only is their baby not invited to our wedding, but that she won't be our flower girl. For the record: Edith cannot walk or talk, and is extremely colicky and will often cry non-stop for hours. (So she's not exactly able to walk down the aisle and isn't a calm and quiet baby that could blend in at a wedding.)\n\nSome additional context: \n- The wedding is in town; they don't have to travel. They therefore have plenty of friends who could (and would) watch Edith.\n- They have known about the wedding for over a year and a half - before Edith was even born.\n- We have absolutely no relationship with Edith because they won't let anyone in Harry/Wes' family get close to Edith. None of us are allowed to hold Edith, talk to her, barely allowed to look at her, etc. \n- Rita and Wes' friends are welcome to spend as much quality time with Edith as they want. \n- We also have no relationship with Rita. She makes no effort when we see her. She doesn't say hi. Doesn't ask questions. Doesn't talk to any of us. She sits on the floor with Edith - with her back to us all, far away from us all, and if she is asked questions she will only answer with yes/no/good/bad. Even before having Edith she never talked to any of us.\n- When Wes and Rita got married a few years ago, they had a ~200 person wedding with *no kids*. They also sat me in the very back corner and I couldn't hear the speeches. \n- Wes is the Best Man and is putting in next to no effort. He has waited until the last second to plan the bachelor party, which means that most of the guys can't make it cause it's too little notice.\n- Wes and Rita are very \"main character\" kinds of people. They think that every moment is and should be about them and their lives. \n\n\nAnyway, they have just informed us that Rita won't be attending our wedding because they \"can't find a sitter\". When we pressed them a little further, they admitted that it's because Edith isn't invited and therefore Rita doesn't see the point in coming -  to her brother-in-law's wedding.\n\nHarry and I refuse to budge, and are at the point where we agree that if Rita doesn't want to come then that's her choice. We don't want to have to beg our sister-in-law to come to our own wedding. \n\nSo people of Reddit - what are your thoughts?

She has made it clear she is not interested in a relationship.", "Lmao why are you asking? They're not even trying. Of course you're NTA.\n\nEnjoy your wedding!", "NTA at all. This reminds me of my uncle\u2019s second wife who took EVERY opportunity to alienate him from his family. When they would visit my grandmother she would just sit and scowl and make snide comments. My grandmother was always kind to her. I remember once she sat there, said nothing, clipped her fingernails and left them on the floor. Then when my grandmother died, she had a fit because my mother wouldn\u2019t give her grandmothers mink coat. After my uncle died, we never saw her, except one time my mother saw her approaching her in the grocery store and Aunt Almeta rudely turned to avoid her. My mother had been nothing but kind to her and even helped her plan the funeral. Almeta died a sad bitter old woman and this is where your SIL is headed.", "I did not read the full posting, because it is the poster's choice, and theirs alone, on how to run their wedding.  NTA.", "NTA. Not only did you state the conditions of the wedding, but they felt entitled having your niece be the flower girl when she can't even walk yet. No brainer really...", "NTA. OP, this is your wedding and your rules. If Wes and Rita continue to object, please bring up all the points that you have stated above and remind them how they have treated you and your partner. Rita obviously made no effort to have a relationship, so you don't need to accommodate her or Wes. Tell them it's their choice to miss the wedding. Congratulations OP, best wishes for a happy marriage!", "NTA. Her not coming seems to be the perfect solution that works for everyone. Have a great wedding!", "NTA. your wedding, your rules", "NTA. Rita doesn't sound like she'll be particularly missed, anyway, on account of her indifference to your relationship and her \"my children are the center of the universe\" attitude.", "NTA  \nWhy do you even care? Even if you were TA you'd be completely justified to be, considering that she doesn't give a crap about you.", "NTA This is a no brainer. But why did you make Harry your best man when your relationship is that bad?", "NTA Good riddance of Rita. There is absolutely nothing wrong having a child free wedding. If their 15 month old isn't well-suited to be a flower girl and is likely to be disruptive there is zero reason her parents should expect her to be involved or attend. It sounds like Rita doesn't like any of you anyway. She is getting what she really wants by staying home.", "15 months old and they are offended? They offend easily. NTA. This isn\u2019t even tight. They are way way wrong.", "NTA - sounds like mom has some issues.  \n\nA super colicky baby is really really difficult to deal with too. If the kiddo cries and cries it can drive you absolutely mad!  \n\nThere are plenty of holds and things people try (food, diet, bedtime routines) to help. But sometimes a kid just cries. Rough!", "NTA.  Why do you even care if Rita comes or not?  You barely know her so I doubt she'll be missed.", "NTA\n\nSomeone who had a childfree wedding is in no position to complain about someone else having one, just because they now got children.\n\nI'd calmly spread the word that now that she is a mother, she want's to play victim. So most of your guest will be aware of her absence.\n\nBut with Wes as Best Man, your partner or you should have a word with the other groomsmen if there are any, or who ever else would sit nearby. So that if Wes gives a speech and thinks it opportune to rant, they can simply pull him out. \n\nYou'll have a commotion either way, so in that case just shut him up and show him, you had enough of their BS.", "NTA.\n\nMost of the additional context points you provided are not relevant. Wes and Rita sound unpleasant, but it doesn't actually matter whether they're nice people or not. They could be the friendliest people in the world and you still wouldn't be the AH.\n\nThe relevant points are:\n\n* You decided on a childfree wedding, as you are fully entitled to do. The same restriction applies to all guests; Wes and Rita aren't being singled out. Nor are they experiencing any great hardship, because they live locally and should have no trouble arranging a babysitter.\n* They want a 15-MONTH-OLD child as a flower girl! I find that absolutely ridiculous. Edith would barely understand what is going on, let alone be able to walk and stand where she is meant to at the appropriate times. As you pointed out, she can't yet walk at all! I think four years old is a reasonable minimum age for a flower girl. Perhaps a mature three years old. 15 months old is just silly. I suspect what Rita really wants is to carry Edith down the aisle and hold her in all the wedding photos, so that Rita herself can effectively be a member of your bridal party.\n\nDon't beg anyone to do anything. Smile politely, say \"That's a shame,\" and move on.\n\nIf Rita or Wes wants to litigate this further, get Harry to deal with them. I'm a firm believer that whenever you have in-law problems, it's your spouse who should be dealing with them, not you. As long as you and your spouse are in agreement, you don't have a problem. (Harry might, but that's for him to deal with. And even he can say firmly to Wes \"The invitation to Rita still stands. She has until \\[date\\] to RSVP. But Edith is not invited. Please don't ask again; no one else is bringing their children, and it's not a subject we're prepared to negotiate on.\")", "NTA. If they don't want to come they don't have to. It's your wedding and therefore your decisions regarding who can come and who cannot. If they ask you again about why the baby can't come, literally list the reasons you gave to us here - no, you would not be TA for sharing these if they ask.\n\nAlso, congratulations!!", "NTA: an invitation is exactly that. An invitation. It is not mandatory.  \n\nYou invited her and told her the qualifications to attend. What she does with that is on her.", "NTA - your wedding, your rules. But, this is very odd behavior for them to take with their child. Hiding her from family with no explanation is way off. I would just tell them, great! We will see BIL at the wedding and we\u2019ll see Rita and Edith in a few years when she\u2019s ready for us to meet.", "NTA Stand your ground and if they choose not to come then they choose not to come.", "NTA. And it kinda sounds like the problem solved itself? Do you actually WANT her at your wedding? And if so, why?", "You\u2019re never TA for not inviting kids to your wedding. Or not inviting anyone you don\u2019t want to invite. It\u2019s your wedding and they\u2019re being brats about it. That\u2019s weird behavior for an adult.", "Just say \"we agree, we don't see the point in you coming either and are grateful you declined.\" Why be passive aggressive when aggressive will do the trick?\n\nAnd you know you're not the asshole.", "NTA. Why is your husband even inviting Wes & Rita. They don't sound like very nice people, tbh. Does Harry have a back-up best man? Because Wes certainly isn't putting any effort into his role. Stand your ground. If they get offended enough, they might not show up. Problem solved ;)", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding, you said no kids so that should be the end of discussion. If a guest doesn\u2019t like that, don\u2019t come", "How would a 15mo child *who can't walk yet* be a flower girl? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAgain, here is wedding/party rules:\n\nThe host, or person who is paying, can invite anyone they want for any reason--I only want left-handed clowns; that's okay.  They can also set any rules they want--I want everyone to wear gladiator attire; that's okay.  It is an invitation not a subpoena.  \n\nThe invitee, the person who received the invitation, can elect to attend or not attend for any reason.  Only thing they have to say is \"Sorry, I can't attend hope it turns out as a lovely party/wedding.\"  Send a gift.  You are attending not hosting.", "NTA, wes and rita are, obviously", "NTA and take the blessing that is Rita\u2019s absence!", "NTA Tell them that you are grateful for them telling you they are not coming. It saves such on postage.\nBe direct and enjoy your big day.  Just remember to have security so they don't try and show up. And inform them of that fact.", "NAH.  You are entitled to have a childfree wedding (it would be my choice, lol).  Just know that some parents may choose not to go to an event where their children are not welcomed, that is their choice too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
