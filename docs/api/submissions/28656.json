Onto the update:\n\nAfter reading your guys\u2019 comments I decided to wait until Sunday to sit down and talk. That way both me and my husband could have space to process our emotions. I noticed that my excitement was clouding my judgement and reading how many of you were saying that my job is more important than him really made me take a step back from thinking about the possibilities and focus on the present.\n\nPlus I had to leave for the weekend to attend a course in another city, so Sunday seemed a good time. After I came back, my husband picked me up and almost immediately said \u201eLet\u2019s go\u201d. I didn\u2019t get what he meant, so I asked where and he said \u201elet\u2019s move to [the country]. I just have two conditions. One is that you will have a proper contract that states every single expense the company will cover and that you wait until my exam to make a final decision on the specifics, as for now I can\u2019t process thinking about the move. I have too much on my plate\u201d.\n\nI was floored. Asked him if he was sure and what about his job and career. He said that yes, he\u2019s sure, as he also wanted to live in that country for a while someday and this seems like a good moment. That he will be able to find something and if not then we\u2019ll still be fine as long as it\u2019s only six months.\n\nYesterday I talked with my boss and asked if we can come back to the planning in December, as it would still give us enough time to organize everything until March (his deadline for the project to start). Explained to him that my husband needs to focus on his exam now, so we won\u2019t be able to plan the move. Fortunately he understood and after a bit of back and forth said that the offer is on the table before Christmas. \n\nPerhaps very anticlimactic for everyone sugesting divorce or me leaving to be a girlboss I always wanted to be, but life is about balance and compromise. Sometimes just not between the parties that we thought. It\u2019s not me vs my husband, but us against the world. Or at least my boss\u2019 request to decide about such a huge thing in a week. Especially that it wasn\u2019t my goal in this company, this is literally the first time someone other than a co-owner would leave for months to open a new branch.\n\nSo Yeah, that\u2019s all!

Hope you guys have a fabulous time!", "I had hoped it would work out, especially with it just being 6 months.

This is fabulous news!  \n\nYour hubby is a brave dude, open to new experiences but with a pragmatic streak.

You sound like a great team.", "Sorry For the divorce comments you received and cheers cut the Big win outcome. Having someone that actually is partner leads to portends possibilities for both of you In the future.", "I'm really happy for both of you!", "You broke everyone's hearts here at AITAH. We want you and everyone else to be as bitter and alone as we are.\n\nAre you sure I couldn't convince you to get a restraining order?", "Thank you!", "Yeah, I\u2019m sometimes impulsive, whereas he needs time to process. Which makes us balance each other out usually, but with the added deadline on decision I was too quick to ask for my husband\u2019s stance knowing his nature. A little bit of patience and it all fell into place :)"]}
