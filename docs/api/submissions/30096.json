Our father died in January of this year alongside his wife. I had not spoken to my father in years and only maintained contact with my siblings. I was lucky to be so much older and working so taking them in was no problem. My father's wife had a daughter who is around 10, I think. She lives with her maternal aunt since her father is unknown. I don't know the girl so I have nothing to do with her and my siblings don't consider her a sister so they didn't want to keep in touch with her or anything and I'm not going to push them since my priority is them and not the girl and I do believe, and so does the therapist they see, that they have never formed an attachment to her. She was always our asshole father's stepkid but not a person they considered family.\n\nThe girls aunt does not like the fact that my siblings did not want to remain in touch with her and she dislikes it even less that I did not want to meet her and be part of her life (I moved out not long after my father moved her and her mother into the house we shared). She reached out to me on social media so I had to block her. But now she has my phone number since my number is online for my job. She has texted me and called me, often she finds a way to call from a new number when I have her blocked. A couple of times I answered and we spoke and I told her to let it go and to focus on her niece and leave me and my siblings alone.\n\nThe incident in question happened last week. It was the little girls birthday and her aunt sent me a text about it and I told her it wasn't my problem via text and said I was blocking the number. She called before I had the chance to answer and she told me her niece wanted to talk to us and the least the three of us could do was wish her a happy birthday and talk to her for a few minutes. I told her no but she handed her over to her niece anyway and the little girl was trying to tell me all about her birthday. I asked if she could pass the phone back to her aunt and she wouldn't take it so the girl kept talking. I told the little girl I had to go and ended the call.\n\nHer aunt texted me a bunch the next day and she called me a dick and said I should never hang up on a child and it broke her niece's heart and I am raising two little monsters because she would be more their sister than I am their brother and blood doesn't matter. More texts about what an awful person I am as well. I blocked that number without replying but yesterday I got another string of texts about the same thing.\n\nIt has worn me down enough that I have to ask if I'm TA for ending the call on her like I did?", "created_utc": 1698838907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17la5ph/aita_for_hanging_up_on_a_child/", "score": 369, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just don\u2019t give her any leeway or engage with her at all.", "NTA.  The aunt, however, is absolutely an AH.  Not stated above, but it seems like aunt is either trying to unload \"niece\" on OP or get $$$$.  To top it off, aunt is willing to use the child to front her schemes.

It sets up expectations that OP cannot and will not fulfill and this situation is ENTIRELY the aunt's fault. It's fine for the aunt to ask, but then you have the difficult conversation with the ten year old so that she can start learning and accepting. Most people here are taking a short sighted view of things and not thinking about the long term consequences.", "Honestly, I am so sorry for that girl, not on your account but on her aunt's. That girl will have a hard time with this type of person as her guardian. \n\nNow yeah, you could've been more sympathetic to a child, she didn't do whatever your father did to make you all so angry. But you are right, she is a stranger to you. It would be different if your siblings wanted a relationship with her, but if you are 100% sure they don't, then making them is absurd. \n\nThe kid is 10, she does not understand of course. And her moronic aunt apparently encourages her heavily in the fantasy of having you all be one happy family despite knowing very well your siblings and your stance on that. Any damage done after her encouragement is on her shoulders.\n\nShe should've tried to explain to her niece in the kindest way possible that your family and hers are going their separate ways. Possibly invest in therapy. Just help her in any way possible to accept the reality....And what she does? She is bullying you into this even tho you must have a lot on your plate right now, dealing with the guardianship and changes. She is making the believe what is not realistic (while she knows it very well) and making her disappointed again and again, that's absurd. \n\nAnyway since the aunt does seem to intend to be kind but honest with the child, if there is an occurrence in the future, where she manages to contact you directly again, I suggest you do it instead.  Children have a surprising capacity for acceptance, but nobody really explained anything to her, certainly her aunt didn't, and you just hung up on her as well. So she has nothing to understand nor accept here. So soft YTA, cause it is not your responsibility to explain, it should be done by the aunt, but again, as an adult, you can see it is not happening and you could;ve explained at least once to the kid directly in a sensitive manner.", "Take a moment and consider it from the kid's point of view. She's 10. 5-ish years ago her family extended from just her and her mom to include a new dad, and a new older sister and brother. For about 5 years, half her life and most of when she can remember she lived in this family of 5.\n\nThen 9 months ago everyone left her and she had to move in with her aunt, who probably wasn't planning on having children and probably hasn't adjusted herself yet. The ONLY immediate family this kid has left are your younger siblings, but rather than letting her have some linkage with her past life, you and your siblings have chosen to abandon her. She's never even going to be able to ask why.\n\nI understand that you were not expecting guardianship of your siblings. I'm certain that this hasn't been easy on you either, OP. This isn't ideal for any of you and you've done a remarkable and impressive thing by reorganising your life to accommodate the needs of two teenagers. I understand that your siblings never bonded with their step mother's daughter. I understand that asking them to agree to allow her a little in their lives would be a fight you don't see any value in having. However, no matter how correct and right for the three of you this exclusion feels, all 3 of you are being YTA to this kid. Not just for hanging up on her, but for trying to completely exclude her from your lives.", "You and your siblings are all assholes.  \n\nThe child is 10, she has no parents.  The parents she had both died.  The family she lived with for most of her life and has the vast majority of her memories with bailed on her and doesn\u2019t even want to take 3 minutes to listen to her and tell her happy birthday.\n\nI get that you all feel no attachment, but you should be able to muster enough empathy to understand how much it means to the little girl.  It would\u2019ve taken less time for you to make her birthday a lot better than it did for you to write this post.  You devalue yourself when you make yourself a person who shits on broken children because they\u2019re an incredibly minor inconvenience.", "YTA\n\nYes, the aunt is manipulative, but you could have said \u201cHappy birthday\u201d to the kid. None of this is her fault.", "That kid is going to internalize the rejection.  Shame there\u2019s not a way to deal with the kid in reject the aunt of.", "ESH. \n\nStay on the line for another 30 seconds. Hanging up is immature, hurtful, and unreasonable. This child has nothing to do with your petty squabbles with your aunt, don't take your anger out on her. Your aunt is the AH for putting the child in that situation.", "The Aunt is bringing serious trauma drama into the child\u2019s life. I know your young and you\u2019re NTA, but I implore you for the sake of the child to form a bit of a bond because the child is going to need help in about 3 years when she becomes a teenager. I mean she already needs it now, but I foresee a lot of hardship and bad choices by the kid as long as she stays with the aunt.", "The aunt is not handling it well.\n\nThe child is a 10 year old that just lost her whole world. \n\nI've had a hard time with a lot of jerks in my family that I cut off communication with, but have never cut off communication with their kids.\n\nIn addition, I am still civil if my a*hole family members end up at the same event as me.\n\nNot knowing your whole situation,  I'm not saying you should do what I would do, but here is what I would do.\n\nI would let the 10 year old be included for a while until  she gets her life back. Let her call, let her visit. Acknowledge birthdays. Send cards.\n\nAt some point, particularly when she moves into her teen years, she will make her own circle of friends and move on naturally.", "Is the 10 year old a bad kid?", "I think ESH. The aunt certainly shouldn't keep pushing the way she does and I understand that your siblings aren't really interested and don't feel an attachment, but the little girl clearly does. I know she's \"not your monkey\", but she's lost her family unit not a year ago, OP. She's trying to hang on to what little is left of that. You don't have to form a close bond with her or to pressure your siblings into it, but would it really have killed you to show a little kindness?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She wants them to be family so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with it", "*bordering on harassment*\n\nACTUAL harassment\n\n>She reached out to me on social media so **I had to block her**.\n\nInitial contact was denied and blocked by recipient\n\n>But now she has my phone number since my number is online for my job. She has texted me and called me\n\nCyber stalking, using information obtained from the internet to further contact that was initially blocked.\n\n>often she **finds a way to call from a new number when I have her blocked**.\n\nPervasive rejection of blocking and use of other methods to continue unwanted communication...The *epitome* of harassment.", "That wouldn't work because it would still be out there thanks to my job.", "He was a shitty father to us, treated our mom like absolute shit until she died, and he was an even worse father after she was gone. His wife was just that. I really didn't know her well or anything. She came into the picture with a kid of her own and that's about all I know, other than she had a sister.", "ESH- absolutely everyone, except the ten year old. I get that OP is young, and has had to take on responsibility for his siblings. The aunt is insane, and I would probably have already sent a cease and desist. Do not take it out on the child though. This kid just lost her entire family.", "OP never had any relationship with the girl and her step siblings don't want one for some reason.\n\nWhy should they lie and pretend to be 'Happy Family'?", "So OP should put this girl\u2019s mental health above his siblings\u2019 mental health just because she\u2019s younger? His siblings are in therapy and the therapist agrees there\u2019s no bond. So should two grieving teenagers be forced to pretend to care for her? How long should that last?  \n\nThat would be *incredibly* cruel. The little girl would not understand that they didn\u2019t actually love her and were just being nice. Eventually, they\u2019ll get tired of faking it and end the relationship. Then the girl has to process their loss all over again *and* deal with the trauma of knowing they weren\u2019t ever interested in her and just faked it to be nice. I can\u2019t imagine the mental issues she\u2019d have from that.", "There are plenty of sad and lonely children in the world and OP has no more connection to them than he does to this girl. If his siblings wanted to keep in contact it would be kind of him to help facilitate that, but they don't. Sad but true.", "Disagree. OP had no relationship with the child and doesn't want one. Encouraging her by talking to her on her birthday would only make things worse.", "So they should lie to a 10 year old girl and pretend to care for her, then just bail when she\u2019s doing better and make her feel abandoned all over again?  You realize that\u2019s cruel, right?", ">I would let the 10 year old be included for a while until she gets her life back. Let her call, let her visit. Acknowledge birthdays. Send cards.\n\n\n\nWhat a cruel take. \n\nMake her a little comfortable and then take it away. \n\nYeah, right \ud83d\ude12", "He made it pretty clear hes not intrested in the kid either and thats 100% thier right.", "The aunt needs to have the child in therapy to help her with her mother and stepfather\u2019s loss. They can also help her process that her former step siblings do not want contact. It sounds like the aunt keeps focusing on the former step siblings, likely telling the girl they\u2019re her brother and sister, which is probably making the situation worse.", "Are you unable to process this? They said happy birthday but were too tired to listen to the kids pointless babble", "I agree. It sounds like they are moody teenagers who mainly care about themselves, or are not dealing well with the trauma. If their home life wasn't great I can 100% understand it, and I get that they aren't attached to this girl, but they lived with her for most of her life and she obviously has an attachment to them. They are the only part of her family that's left and she probably misses them. Given proper guidance they may understand that as they get older, but they don't have that. The situation just sucks. I get OP not caring to have a relationship with her, but I just feel bad that this kids life was turned upside down and now the only family she had is rejecting her. I don't know, it's just a messed up situation.", "I'm not. I simply have never had a relationship with her and my siblings never bonded with her. They only ever saw her as our father's stepkid.", "No, they're taking out their anger on the adult who is harassing them.", "I am really not interested. I share no blood, history or family ties with this child.", "I don't know it's her when she changes her number so regularly. It would be bad for business if I ignored every unknown call I get.", "...which the child is going to feel *great* about once she figures it out.\n\nKids can be observant and smart.", "100%", "Thats a pretty uncharitable view. The girl wanted to talk to the people she considers her sibling onnher birthday. Its not hard to believe a 10 year old would be struggling with that rejection after losing both parents.", "Absolutely. And, if she can't convince OP, she'll try it with OP's siblings as soon as they turn 18.", "There's no practical way to do that even if it were the right thing to do.\n\nForce a 15 year old and a 16 year old to entertain a 10 year old who they see as a hangover of their late, unlamented father's terrible life? And whatever could be forced will cease instantly at age 18. You can't force family relationships.\n\nIt's not the 10 year old's fault but neither is it the fault or responsibility of the 15 yr old, the 16 year old and especially OP.\n\nThe aunt should be redirecting the attention of the 10 yr old elsewhere as quickly as possible. She's the biggest AH.", "Maybe get the police involved since the aunt's harassing you?", "If you haven't already, get a notebook/binder or start a file and back it up regularly. Record every time she reaches out. How often, how she acts, what insults she uses, especially if she ever tries to reach out to your siblings directly. If you can get another person to confirm your account record, who and which instance they witnessed. If it escalates and you need to take official action, this is info you won't be wanting to dig around in your memory for.", "NTA. Send her one warning text that you\u2019re going to start filing harassment charges against her. She is to leave you alone from here on out or you\u2019ll be seeing her in court.\n\nGo to the local police with every number she\u2019s called you from and all of the texts she\u2019s sent. File a harassment report. Get a copy of it. Anytime she contacts you or your siblings, file and get a copy of the report. You\u2019re building a case against her by doing this.\n\nThis way, if it escalates or something happens, you have proof. \n\nNTA. Protect your siblings. She\u2019s the asshole", "You can file a police report on harassment or get a cease and desist letter from a lawyer and require all contact through that POC else escalation will occur.", "Because she's most likely trying to off-load that kid onto you and your siblings in the future.  Protect your siblings OP, I can't blame your siblings for wanting nothing to do with the stepsister, because you all have a right to say no and be heard.", "Send a cease and desist letter. NTA", "any chances she wants to pawn that girl of to you as end goal?", "Because she's most likely trying to off-load that kid onto you and your siblings in the future.  Protect your siblings OP, I can't blame your siblings for wanting nothing to do with the stepsister, because you all have a right to say no and be heard.", "Couldn't you file for harassment with all the numbers she's using? I dunno what country you're in but where I live i did that once and that person only used 2 different numbers to get to me (although they WERE deemed dangerous so it's probably a bit different)\n\nNTA though. It just sounds exhausting for you. I'm sorry :(", "You can write your own C&D, although it has more force coming from a lawyer.", "I WISH I COULD UPVOTE THIS A MILLION TIMES", "Tha aunt should understand that trying to force things will hurt the little girl even more, when it's clear her siblings want nothing to do with her.\n\nI think she's more interested in using OP and siblings as babysitters with the excuse of foistering a relationship with the siblings.", "That sucks, I'm sorry.", "NTA. This Woman is doing far more damage to this child with her bs on top of her losing her mom. You are not responsible in any way. Keep protecting your siblings peace.", "To avoid piling on the extreme trauma a 10 year old is experiencing.\n\nTo show a tiny little portion of normal human kindness. Taking 5 minutes to be nice to a kid is not some massive ask.\n\nIf I knew any of my friends or family were acting like OP, I would 100% call them out on being a thundering asshole.", "But the siblings do.  That\u2019s the whole point.  OP said the child wanted to talk to \u201cus\u201d which includes the siblings.  So instead of telling the siblings \u201cget on the phone for 5 minutes, listen to her, tell her happy birthday, then go on about your day\u201d they made a huge deal out of it.", "Show me where they said Happy Birthday to the kid. The Aunt is the one who asked if they could. OP said no.", "Why should OP have any connection to his dead estranged father's wife's child?? He doesn't know her and his siblings don't consider her family.", "Yeah buddy, you\u2019re under 0 obligation to do so. It was just my two cents if you had a nagging feeling that maybe you wanted to go that route. But again, i understand completely you\u2019re POV. I wish you the best!", "I agree with you. In addition, I believe she's pushing so hard for the relationship is over the \"it takes a village\" mentality.", "Is that a joke you would call police for this?", "The siblings don't want to talk to her. They don't see her as a sister and it sounds like they never did. There's no point in forcing it. And OP didn't slam the phone down in her ear. He said he had to go and said goodbye.", "I agree with you 100%. I was just suggesting a \u201ckind\u201d route to take given how awful the caretaker of the child. But you\u2019re right, he has 0 obligation to the kid.", "Yes it does \u201ctake a village\u201d of people who want to help raise the child.  This is the part people forget.  Aunt is just looking for someone to give her an occasional break by being to drop the kid off somewhere", "I got a \u201clooking for free babysitter\u201d vibes.", "I disagree. I am wondering if the Aunt is looking to push the child off on OP completely and be done with her responsibilities of raising the child!", "Yeah you can't force someone to be in your village, that is called kidnapping or prison", "AFTER he was approached online AND TOLD the aunt to stop reaching out to him. He was STALKED online to the point where his number (posted for his job) was used to continue unwanted contact. THEN the aunt *insisted* on calling/texting from unknown numbers to continue UNWANTED contact. By the time the call with the child took place, OP had had his fill with boundaries being stomped. EVEN then, he told her he \"had to go\" and the child (being a child) wanted a lengthy conversation. I don't stay on the phone with people I don't want to speak to either, AND I DON'T MUTE THE PHONE TO PRETEND THAT I AM ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION I DON'T WANT TO HAVE. It's childish and disrepectful to the other party *and* self erodes boundaries. NO is a full sentence; as is *always* being quoted on Reddit.", "At this point we agree to disagree", ">called kidnapping or prison\n\nLMAO.", "You don't hang up on a child because you're fighting with their aunt. It's that simple.\n\n OP ITA for doing so, Aunt ITA for putting the child in that situation.", "OP isn\u2019t fighting with the girls aunt. OP is being stalked by the girls aunt after repeatedly being told to stop contacting them and blocking random numbers.   This isn\u2019t a small family disagreement it\u2019s someone trying to force themselves into the lives of 3 people who don\u2019t want them there"]}
