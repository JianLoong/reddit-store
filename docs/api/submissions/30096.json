Our father died in January of this year alongside his wife. I had not spoken to my father in years and only maintained contact with my siblings. I was lucky to be so much older and working so taking them in was no problem. My father's wife had a daughter who is around 10, I think. She lives with her maternal aunt since her father is unknown. I don't know the girl so I have nothing to do with her and my siblings don't consider her a sister so they didn't want to keep in touch with her or anything and I'm not going to push them since my priority is them and not the girl and I do believe, and so does the therapist they see, that they have never formed an attachment to her. She was always our asshole father's stepkid but not a person they considered family.\n\nThe girls aunt does not like the fact that my siblings did not want to remain in touch with her and she dislikes it even less that I did not want to meet her and be part of her life (I moved out not long after my father moved her and her mother into the house we shared). She reached out to me on social media so I had to block her. But now she has my phone number since my number is online for my job. She has texted me and called me, often she finds a way to call from a new number when I have her blocked. A couple of times I answered and we spoke and I told her to let it go and to focus on her niece and leave me and my siblings alone.\n\nThe incident in question happened last week. It was the little girls birthday and her aunt sent me a text about it and I told her it wasn't my problem via text and said I was blocking the number. She called before I had the chance to answer and she told me her niece wanted to talk to us and the least the three of us could do was wish her a happy birthday and talk to her for a few minutes. I told her no but she handed her over to her niece anyway and the little girl was trying to tell me all about her birthday. I asked if she could pass the phone back to her aunt and she wouldn't take it so the girl kept talking. I told the little girl I had to go and ended the call.\n\nHer aunt texted me a bunch the next day and she called me a dick and said I should never hang up on a child and it broke her niece's heart and I am raising two little monsters because she would be more their sister than I am their brother and blood doesn't matter. More texts about what an awful person I am as well. I blocked that number without replying but yesterday I got another string of texts about the same thing.\n\nIt has worn me down enough that I have to ask if I'm TA for ending the call on her like I did?", "created_utc": 1698838907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17la5ph/aita_for_hanging_up_on_a_child/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It took a *lot* for you to get to the point of hanging up on the kid, and you really tried to avoid it (eg. \"put aunt back on\").\n\nHer aunt should be able to \"read the room\" and should be actively insulating you and the kid from each other, for the kid's sake.  But it sounds to me like she's more concerned with judging you and your sibs than with what's good for that kid.", "NTA \n\n>she called me a dick and said I should never hang up on a child\n\nShe should never use a child. The aunt was just trying to find another way to manipulate you.\n\n>More texts about what an awful person I am\n\nShe should be grateful that you aren't in their lives if she really believes that's true.", "NTA - I think she wants to push the responsibility for her niece off onto you.  \nYour brother and sister come first.", "NTA - if anyone is it\u2019s the Aunt.\n\nReport her to the police for harassment. If you receive any more texts from her from different numbers, block without responding. If she calls and you answer, hang up immediately without saying anything else and block the number. \n\nI had some friends go through something kinda similar - it over 200 new phone numbers later before they finally gave up. Just don\u2019t give her any leeway or engage with her at all.", "NTA.  The aunt, however, is absolutely an AH.  Not stated above, but it seems like aunt is either trying to unload \"niece\" on OP or get $$$$.  To top it off, aunt is willing to use the child to front her schemes.  I would consider involving the authorities at this point since the harassment isn't stopping.", "Nta", "The aunt is a major dick. NTA, though i do feel bad for that little girl.", "Tell her you will be reporting her to the police of r harassment if this doesn't stop. \n\nImmediately hang up if she calls. \n\nNTA people need to learn how to take no.", "You\u2019re going to have to file a Temporary Restraining Order against this woman. You need to get the police involved and at least let them know the levels of harassment this woman is doing to you and your siblings.  \n\nThis is when the cops are there to help you.", "NTA. \n\nTo all the people telling OP that they're TA for not talking to the sister - talking to her would do more harm than good. It sets up expectations that OP cannot and will not fulfill and this situation is ENTIRELY the aunt's fault. It's fine for the aunt to ask, but then you have the difficult conversation with the ten year old so that she can start learning and accepting. Most people here are taking a short sighted view of things and not thinking about the long term consequences.", "Honestly, I am so sorry for that girl, not on your account but on her aunt's. That girl will have a hard time with this type of person as her guardian. \n\nNow yeah, you could've been more sympathetic to a child, she didn't do whatever your father did to make you all so angry. But you are right, she is a stranger to you. It would be different if your siblings wanted a relationship with her, but if you are 100% sure they don't, then making them is absurd. \n\nThe kid is 10, she does not understand of course. And her moronic aunt apparently encourages her heavily in the fantasy of having you all be one happy family despite knowing very well your siblings and your stance on that. Any damage done after her encouragement is on her shoulders.\n\nShe should've tried to explain to her niece in the kindest way possible that your family and hers are going their separate ways. Possibly invest in therapy. Just help her in any way possible to accept the reality....And what she does? She is bullying you into this even tho you must have a lot on your plate right now, dealing with the guardianship and changes. She is making the believe what is not realistic (while she knows it very well) and making her disappointed again and again, that's absurd. \n\nAnyway since the aunt does seem to intend to be kind but honest with the child, if there is an occurrence in the future, where she manages to contact you directly again, I suggest you do it instead.  Children have a surprising capacity for acceptance, but nobody really explained anything to her, certainly her aunt didn't, and you just hung up on her as well. So she has nothing to understand nor accept here. So soft YTA, cause it is not your responsibility to explain, it should be done by the aunt, but again, as an adult, you can see it is not happening and you could;ve explained at least once to the kid directly in a sensitive manner.", "Take a moment and consider it from the kid's point of view. She's 10. 5-ish years ago her family extended from just her and her mom to include a new dad, and a new older sister and brother. For about 5 years, half her life and most of when she can remember she lived in this family of 5.\n\nThen 9 months ago everyone left her and she had to move in with her aunt, who probably wasn't planning on having children and probably hasn't adjusted herself yet. The ONLY immediate family this kid has left are your younger siblings, but rather than letting her have some linkage with her past life, you and your siblings have chosen to abandon her. She's never even going to be able to ask why.\n\nI understand that you were not expecting guardianship of your siblings. I'm certain that this hasn't been easy on you either, OP. This isn't ideal for any of you and you've done a remarkable and impressive thing by reorganising your life to accommodate the needs of two teenagers. I understand that your siblings never bonded with their step mother's daughter. I understand that asking them to agree to allow her a little in their lives would be a fight you don't see any value in having. However, no matter how correct and right for the three of you this exclusion feels, all 3 of you are being YTA to this kid. Not just for hanging up on her, but for trying to completely exclude her from your lives.", "You and your siblings are all assholes.  \n\nThe child is 10, she has no parents.  The parents she had both died.  The family she lived with for most of her life and has the vast majority of her memories with bailed on her and doesn\u2019t even want to take 3 minutes to listen to her and tell her happy birthday.\n\nI get that you all feel no attachment, but you should be able to muster enough empathy to understand how much it means to the little girl.  It would\u2019ve taken less time for you to make her birthday a lot better than it did for you to write this post.  You devalue yourself when you make yourself a person who shits on broken children because they\u2019re an incredibly minor inconvenience.", "YTA\n\nYes, the aunt is manipulative, but you could have said \u201cHappy birthday\u201d to the kid. None of this is her fault.", "That kid is going to internalize the rejection.  Shame there\u2019s not a way to deal with the kid in reject the aunt of.", "ESH. \n\nStay on the line for another 30 seconds. Hanging up is immature, hurtful, and unreasonable. This child has nothing to do with your petty squabbles with your aunt, don't take your anger out on her. Your aunt is the AH for putting the child in that situation.", "The Aunt is bringing serious trauma drama into the child\u2019s life. I know your young and you\u2019re NTA, but I implore you for the sake of the child to form a bit of a bond because the child is going to need help in about 3 years when she becomes a teenager. I mean she already needs it now, but I foresee a lot of hardship and bad choices by the kid as long as she stays with the aunt.", "The aunt is not handling it well.\n\nThe child is a 10 year old that just lost her whole world. \n\nI've had a hard time with a lot of jerks in my family that I cut off communication with, but have never cut off communication with their kids.\n\nIn addition, I am still civil if my a*hole family members end up at the same event as me.\n\nNot knowing your whole situation,  I'm not saying you should do what I would do, but here is what I would do.\n\nI would let the 10 year old be included for a while until  she gets her life back. Let her call, let her visit. Acknowledge birthdays. Send cards.\n\nAt some point, particularly when she moves into her teen years, she will make her own circle of friends and move on naturally.", "Is the 10 year old a bad kid?", "I think ESH. The aunt certainly shouldn't keep pushing the way she does and I understand that your siblings aren't really interested and don't feel an attachment, but the little girl clearly does. I know she's \"not your monkey\", but she's lost her family unit not a year ago, OP. She's trying to hang on to what little is left of that. You don't have to form a close bond with her or to pressure your siblings into it, but would it really have killed you to show a little kindness?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
