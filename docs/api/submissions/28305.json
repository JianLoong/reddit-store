Just because they trust it doesn't mean other strangers will, and look what happened.

I was very angry but held my tongue and moved on.  \n\nI've been bit before, it took a decade but the scars have mostly faded. It was severe and took a long time to heal.

Yelling at them was something I can understand because you had just been knocked over on your back unexpectedly by their jumping off leash dog. It seems like those people need to learn how to be responsible dog owners.", "NTA\n\nThat dog is obviously not trained enough to be off leash and presents a danger to itself and others. It's also understandable to be angry right after a dog just knocked you to the ground. It's a situation where you did not know if the dog was aggressive or playful. \n\n Of course it's easy for people to say you overreacted after the fact because no one got seriously hurt but if something actually did go wrong there was absolutely no time for anyone to have been able to do anything about it.

My golden retriever is super friendly, but he likes to jump on people to greet them.", "NTA- a lot dog owners are over the top. Having dogs off leash in a public park is not okay. I know a few people who are terrified of dogs because they have been bitten or attacked. It is just such entitled behavior to take an animal that jumps on people and just let it run loose.

At the very least, any off leash dog should have a rock solid recall the first time their owner calls their name, but of course they never do.

And every time a dog jumps up on somebody or knocks somebody over or does something that can be quite harmful, the owners just laughing giggle and say it's oh so cute look how the doggy loves you. No, I would have done the exact same thing. They are in a public place. The dog needs to be on a fucking leash", "NTA.\n\nYou may have done this family a favor by \"overreacting\".

I\u2019d hope that if leashes aren\u2019t needed though, that they\u2019d at least realize that maybe *their* dog might need a leash because it\u2019s unacceptable to jump up on strangers. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do at least. And the fact they hardly reacted to OP falling down is baffling, I\u2019d be apologizing profusely.", "Mmm, even if it's an off leash dog park isn't the expectation your dog must be responsive to verbal commands? Ie not running up and body-planting strangers  for no reason?", "Really it wouldn\u2019t matter. As a dog owner you are responsible for keeping your off leash dog (in an off leash area) responsive to verbal commands at all times. Did he react in an appropriate way? No. But the dog owners should be more responsible. NTA", "I disagree. *Won't someone please thank of the children!*\n\n\nThis could be a matter of life or death for the dog. If it hurts someone, the dog could be put down. There was no apology from the owner, so they likely don't care they just caused a random stranger to be knocked down, so what's stopping them from doing it again? How else are they going to learn that it's unacceptable and likely illegal? \n\n\n\nEven if they don't knock me over, I scream the same thing at owners with off leash dogs, and Idgaf if they happen to have kids nearby. If they were being considerate, it wouldn't be necessary. \n\n\nA profanity hurts nothing but feelings. \n\n\nNTA", "Are you pleasant and thinking clearly when you were just barreled down by a random thing?", "Swearing loudly in public isn\u2019t illegal, assault is. Saying control your fucking dog isn\u2019t over the top if the dog just knocked you down.", "I hope there won't be a next time.", "You are severely outvoted here. Take your YTA somewhere else.", "I was screaming at the parents, not the kid.", "They had just had a dog run at them and knock them over.  What should they have done?  Yelling at the owners is totally appropriate.  They weren\u2019t yelling at the kid, it just happened to be there.", "Or breaks her pelvis and never really recovers which is a very common thing among older people who fall, unfortunately.", "Falling wrong is so easy to do too. All sorts of things can happen.", "Seriously. My mother stepped back into a small hole in our yard, and the resulting fall was hard enough to rupture a disc in her back. Six months or so later I had to call 911 when the pain finally got so bad that she couldn't even get out of bed, and she had to have surgery to have the disc removed/replaced/whatever it is they do.\n\nHell, I'm sure there's more than a handful of cases of people hitting their heads and dying from a \"simple\" fall. Like yeah, the chances are slim, but they could potentially fucking kill someone.", "I used to walk in a park close to my home while pregnant since my street is hilly and I had to stop because this guy wouldn\u2019t leash his \u201cfriendly\u201d dog. The stupid thing kept jumping up on my belly and if my balance had been worse in later pregnancy it would have totally knocked me over. I didn\u2019t want to risk a placental abruption due to dumbass dog owner so I had to stop walking there even though he was the one not obeying the leash law\u2026", "Even if the dog isn't up to date on shots you still won't be getting rabies unless the dog has rabies. You won't just get rabies just because a dog bit you. It's incredibly rare to get rabies from an animal without rabies.", "Probably so but there is a range in \"responsive to verbal commands\". I've known dogs that know all the tricks but will still run up to strangers at the dog park since everyone there treats them like friends. I don't think its a YTA if it was a off leash dog park but maybe closer to a NAH since OP carries some responsibility for running in that area.", "[deleted]", "Even if you are right for the story, you are an asshole for that comment. Gross.", "Still. If you expect them to control their dog, leash your reactions.", "Screaming expletives at the parent, which IMO makes it worse. There's no need for that kind of language around children.", "all it takes is hitting the ground at the wrong angle", "That sucks :(", "And on the off chance that I do get it from that one dog, there's no cure for it. I'm in my 20s and I have my life ahead of me, I'd rather not get an incurable disease.", "You sound like the owner who let her aggressive dog into the dog park, where it proceeded to attack MY dog. If a dog is aggressive or even just too eager that it injures someone or another animal, it has no business being off leash, period.", "I don\u2019t think the profanities are what made the kid cry.  And it must feel great to be so morally superior.", "L + ratio + cope + mald", "Nope, I don\u2019t think they will get it until someone (rightfully) freaks out", "We should expect dogs and people to be under control in public. If a person shoved you over I\u2019m pretty sure you would yell at them and that would be totally okay.", "you sound like such an overdramatic idiot, jesus. YTA", "Unless you\u2019re literally on the moon, I\u2019m fairly certain there\u2019s treatment lmao. \n\nNo, there\u2019s no cure for rabies. BUT if you\u2019re exposed to it, there are ways to prevent the infection from actually doing anything. \n\nOne of my students (then 7) had a bat in his house & the whole family had to go through treatment for rabies - which was just a series of injections. Little guy said he got his vampire vaccine & lived to tell the tale. \n\nAs long as you seek treatment w/in a week to two weeks of any potential rabies bite, you\u2019re going to be fine. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for yelling at the irresponsible dog owners\u2026 but dude. It\u2019s 2023. The drama isn\u2019t necessary.", "You're not getting rabies from a dog jumping on you dude calm down", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement).
