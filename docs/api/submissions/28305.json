Just because they trust it doesn't mean other strangers will, and look what happened.

I was very angry but held my tongue and moved on.  \n\nI've been bit before, it took a decade but the scars have mostly faded. It was severe and took a long time to heal.

Yelling at them was something I can understand because you had just been knocked over on your back unexpectedly by their jumping off leash dog. It seems like those people need to learn how to be responsible dog owners.", "NTA\n\nThat dog is obviously not trained enough to be off leash and presents a danger to itself and others. It's also understandable to be angry right after a dog just knocked you to the ground. It's a situation where you did not know if the dog was aggressive or playful. \n\n Of course it's easy for people to say you overreacted after the fact because no one got seriously hurt but if something actually did go wrong there was absolutely no time for anyone to have been able to do anything about it.

My golden retriever is super friendly, but he likes to jump on people to greet them.", "NTA- a lot dog owners are over the top. Having dogs off leash in a public park is not okay. I know a few people who are terrified of dogs because they have been bitten or attacked. It is just such entitled behavior to take an animal that jumps on people and just let it run loose.

At the very least, any off leash dog should have a rock solid recall the first time their owner calls their name, but of course they never do.

And every time a dog jumps up on somebody or knocks somebody over or does something that can be quite harmful, the owners just laughing giggle and say it's oh so cute look how the doggy loves you. No, I would have done the exact same thing. They are in a public place. The dog needs to be on a fucking leash", "NTA.\n\nYou may have done this family a favor by \"overreacting\".
