We have been together 6 years and we have a 2yo daughter together. Until recently I was a SAHM. He works Wed, Thurs, Sat, and Sun, 12-7p. He is off Mon, Tue, and Fri and he watches our kid while I work Mon-Fri 7-6p. Our kid is in bed at 11p.\n\nThis is going to get clunky, but it's important. Mon, I work, Im off at 6 he leaves at 8 to go to the Gym with a buddy. Tue, I work, I'm off at 6, he goes at 8 to play poker with friends. Wed, we both work (we have a babysitter) I'm off at 6, he's off at 7, he goes at 8 to game night. Thur, we both work, I'm off at 6, he's off at 7, leaves at 8 to the gym. Fri, he watches our daughter, I get off at 6, then he leaves at 8 to the gym with a friend. Each night home after 12. Sat & Sun are the only days he stays home after work, on my days off.\n\nThe fight we are having is I am asking him to stay home with us more. I feel as though he is consistently out with friends. This is the concrete schedule he follows every week, and doesn't even include if one of his friends spurs a \"quick\" drink at the bar, hang out, or go have dinner. \n\nI feel I am always obligated to watch our daughter, when he simply isn't bound by that same responsibility. He did this even when I was a SAHM, so my outings or time with friends is extremely rare and consists of me finding a babysitter to make anything work. When I ask that he not go to the gym, or not go to a gaming night, I'm told that I'm purposefully spoiling his plans. Since I know his schedule I shouldn't try to do anything unless its on the two days that he doesn't have plans IF hes not too tired.\n\nWhen I was a SAHM, I did all house maintenance. When I mentioned getting a job months ago because I was feeling isolated, he was against it because he said a babysitter would then be \"raising\" our daughter ( mind you the baby sitter watches her for 6hrs, 2x a week). When I said that we needed to begin to split chores, he said that was the reason I got a job so I could abandon my responsibilities as a mom and place them on him instead.\n\nIts been about a month since I've started my job, I have gotten to be with friends twice. I always come home, and I take care of our daughter. I continue do all house maintenance. When I ask him if he would condense the amount of hobbies he has so he can stay home and help more, he says that I am being controlling and trying to stomp on any enjoyment he gets. He says working out isn't considered a hobby since it's for health reasons, I say how I want do the same but I don't have that option. If a friend ever asks him to miss work for an event, he will in a heartbeat, but if I ask to stay home to help or something, I'm met with \"we can't afford for me to miss work.\"\n\nI've told him before that yes I am jealous of time you give to friends instead of us and that I don't get the same opportunities. To me, its the point that he has the unlimited option to have a life outside of the home and I do not.

He\u2019s a major AH. He\u2019s gaslighting you to get his way. Don\u2019t put up with his BS. \n\nFor a marriage to work COMPROMISES have to be made on BOTH SIDES. You both work together for the family\u2019s needs and make the family the priority, not his \u201cenjoyment\u201d or \u201cplans.\u201d His role in the family does not end in just working to put food on the table. Sure it\u2019s a huge deal, but that does not mean he has the right to walk all over you and prioritize his needs and desires while ignoring yours.  \n\nMy question is\u2026 how long has he been not helping around the house? When you first lived together you should have set an agreement on the division of chores. I\u2019m assuming you were still working at the time. Did he just leave everything to you and you didn\u2019t complain about it?", "He is the AH and you need to reevaluate your relationship. It sounds like he had the perfect setup when he convinced you to be a SAHM because then you felt too guilty to argue with him about his social life because he worked outside the home all day. \n\nNow that you\u2019re on more equal footing (even though the logic was flawed to begin with and he was just preying on your guilt) he doesn\u2019t have the same freedom to socialize like he did and a reevaluation is in order. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say this and I don\u2019t know your story, but this sounds like a man who is having an affair and is not interested in a relationship with you. You\u2019re his nanny and his maid, but he\u2019s making it pretty clear that you\u2019re not his partner, friend or lover. That\u2019s not how you treat people you love or even like.", "He leaves at 8 for the gym and doesn't come home til after 12...  and you believe he's actually at the gym? Four hours?", "NTA you\u2019re married to a misogynist who has said to your face that he expects you to do all the child rearing. He had no respect for you to have time with your friends or workout time. He expects his life to carry on like normal after a kid. Absolutely do not have any more kids", "NTA, and this seems like such a recurring theme with married couples. You shouldn\u2019t have to beg him to be home, he should want to be home with you and his daughter. If he doesn\u2019t see how this whole situation is unfair to you, he\u2019s a lost cause. Also the sexism should\u2019ve been a major red flag with his concerns about you wanting to go back to work.", "This hurt to read. NTA\n\nHe doesn't view you as an equal or even just another person. He isn't investing in you or your relationship, lifting you up, celebrating you. \n\nOnly when you are gone will he realise that he's fucked it up. Don't fall for it. He will just be missing his routine of prioritising himself above you.", "Sis, this is not a marriage. This is not how marriage works. A marriage is a partnership and there is no partnership here. Its you and him totally separately without any compromise. He gets what he wants while you get railroaded.\n\nSo, tell me, what do you get out of this marriage? \n\nI'll tell you this as a woman in her later 40s with multiple kids who is happily married -- life is too short for this kind of inbalance. My guess is you guys got married young and you don't know anything different but this is not normal nor is it a healthy dynamic.\n\nSo, next week, you leave at 7pm every day to go do something. ANything. Just peace out at 7pm and do that for 2 weeks. When he gets PISSED off and he will, tell him that is EXACTLY how you feel when he does it to you. He didn't like it?

I could\u2019ve written this, with the exception that mine would\u2019ve never watched our child while I was at work and he was home.  They went to sitter/daycare.  Single for 6 years now.  Much happier.  He still barely sees or does anything for or with the child, now a teen, and the child really can\u2019t be bothered with him most of the time.", "NTA.  But there is an old cliche about 'seven year itch'.  The issue is 'his life' and 'your life' do not walk the same path.  Unless this is changed, you will have more to deal with than his buddies.  Start with seeking counseling for yourself and then both of you.  Men often don't realize a marriage is in peril until past the point of no return.  Take steps to protect yourself and your interests (financial, logistical) and then have  'the conversation' that educates him.  Good luck.", "NTA. Partners should make our lives easier not harder. You would have a better time just taking care of and cleaning up after you and your daughter.", "NTA. Your husband doesn't sound like he's cares about you or your daughter much. Be aware that isn't likely to change", "My only question is why you believe his stories and why you're still with him?. He's not putting you as a priority because he has someone else to make a priority. He's not willing to budge on \"going to the gym\" for 4 hours straight because it's code for \"spending time with his side chick\". \n\nRespectfully,  wake up. Your husband is cheating on you and he's making it all too obvious. \n\nDivorce him.", "This may be a trend in this sib but\n\n\"he said that was the reason I got a job so I could abandon my responsibilities as a mom and place them on him instead\"\n\nI would've divorced him so quick after this bs", "Why are you married? He gets to do anything he wants anyways.", "NTA.  Take your child and RUN.  You will be better as a single parent.", "NTA\n\nBut he is not hanging out with friends. People are busy.

Not cool.", "NTA, and you should just bring a change of clothes with you, then when you get off work while he's with your daughter, call him and tell him you have plans and you'll be back later. He's either going to start understanding your side, or you're going to realize you don't actually have a partner.", "Why is he not taking you out to dinner? Why not plan (without his knowledge) to meet up with a friend after you get off work and don't answer your phone when he calls or texts. Don't go home until after your daughter is in bed. Yeah it'll be a fight but stand firm and tell him how it's going to be. He gets to go out and you also deserve to go out and meet up with friends. Tell him he's acting like a single man without family obligations. If he wants to be a single man, you can make that happen. But there will be times that he will be completely responsible for HIS daughter when it's HIS custody time.", "Nta. You don't have a SO, you have a roommate. For some, that's fine. But you wouldn't be posting if you were fine. He's also giving some masculine toxicity with \"did you go back to work so you could make me do your chores?\" It's not chores, it's him being a father. Either you need to create a schedule of your own, talk to his friend to create new boundaries, or follow his schedule and go to the gym with him.", "Nta, damn we don't even have kids and my wife would be like wtf I never see you if I pulled this", "NTA. He\u2019s a selfish prick and needs an ultimatum.

He doesn't give a shit about you.", "NTA. He works 4 days a week a part time schedule, but doesn't do any house maintenance, and goes out from 8-12 at least 4 nights a week? First off, no one goes to the gym for 4 hours. So that's bs. Secondly, how is it, that he contributes so little but feels so entitled? Third, just from an objective standpoint, he gets to go out to do his preferred activities 4 nights every week and you're lucky to get 1 night out here and there, how does he justify that disparity?", "NTA.   You need to sit down and tell him that  you need equitable time away from the house.  He needs to give up two of his nights and they become yours.  If he refuses, why stay married to someone who just wants you to cook, clean, watch the kid, and feed him?", "He's not interested in spending time with you. There's no solution to this. NTA.", "Well if you end up leaving him, take comfort in the fact that you won't become much more of a single parent than you already are. So there's that.", "Of course NTA. I hope you can see that.", "NTA. He is.", "NTA. \n\nWalk the fuck out. \n\nGet a lawyer, get a divorce. If you're already working, doing the vast majority of childcare, doing the vast majority of household chores, AND getting yelled at and nagged by a man spending basically every evening doing whatever he wants while you get zero free time...leave. Stop cleaning up after him and make him actually take care of your kid during his parenting time, and get recreational time for yourself while he has your kid. And child support. Screw that guy.", "Have a 1 year old. I work full time wife is part time by choice (she can quit if she wants). My wife lets me sleep in on my work days and she gets up early. I usually try and give her a day to sleep in on weekends. \n\nAs to the rest of it my family comes first. We both get out individually occasionally but it\u2019s maybe once a month.  Now I have a high stress job so that\u2019s partly why but either way I couldn\u2019t imagine dumping it all on my wife nor do I want to be away from them that much. \n\nNTA and your husband is in divorce territory in my opinion", "NTA. Your husband has a warped view of the responsibilities of parenthood and upkeep of a home. I would suggest mediation, where you throw all schedules out the window and start over from the beginning and get this sorted. Unless you do, I don't see your relationship lasting much longer.", "He\u2019s TA, for sure. If he doesn\u2019t re-prioritize you and your child, time to go! Also, 11pm is WAY too late of a bedtime for a child.", "NTA and I think you need to be bluntly told that this person isn\u2019t going to change. There is very little respect for you and your child.
