{"id": 30590, "submission_id": "17qskg8", "title": "AITA for excluding my \"adopted sister\" from family photos?", "selftext": "This is a throwaway and I'm using fake names.\n\nI am 26F and my \"adopted sister\" Ally is 14F. The way we're \"related\" is that my younger brother Michael (24M) has been with his wife Maya (24F) since their freshman year of high school. Maya and Ally had a really bad home life and my mom is very much a \"my home is open to everyone\" type of person, so over that year Maya began spending more and more time at our house, eventually bringing Ally over as well since she was always babysitting. By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house.\n\nMy mom and dad say that they love both Maya and Ally like their own children. My other siblings (18M and 16F) also treat her like she's a part of the family. Even after Maya and Michael moved out, Ally is still at their house the same amount, if not more than she was before. Now to preface, I have nothing against Ally. She's a good kid and I make an effort to be nice to her. However, I've never really liked how she was foisted into our lives. She's not actually adopted and she \\*still has parents and her own family\\*. Yet my parents spend so much time and resources on her, it's ridiculous. Everyone else has started unironically calling her their daughter or sister and I've refused. I just don't consider her to be family.\n\nAnyways, I got married recently, which is where the issues start. I invited Ally to the wedding, of course, and she came with all of my other family. When we were doing pictures of the wedding parties, I decided that I wanted one with all of my immediate family (so my parents, my siblings, and Maya, and Maya and Michael's daughter). My mom brought Ally up to come take the picture with us and I was forced to tell her no. My mom started to get upset but then Ally said it was okay and sat down by herself. My mom isn't a very confrontational person so she didn't make a big deal of it but then everyone else realized that Ally wasn't there and they got mad as well.\n\nUltimately, we took the photo how I wanted it because they \"didn't want to do this at my wedding\" but my entire family is pissed at me now. My mom said that Ally cried when she got home because I don't love her, which I don't. I feel like they forced into a position where I had to do an asshole thing by forcing this kid onto me. I don't think I should have to consider her family if I don't want to. AITA?\n\nEdit: After the ceremony but before the reception, the wedding party and both of our close family's took photos. I did not include Ally in this photo session and she sat with the rest of the regular guests waiting for dinner. I did not intentionally exclude her from any of the photos taken. I'm sure she's in some of them from throughout the night especially because she was there with my family. I hope that clears some things up.\n\nEdit 2: Maya and Ally are sisters. Sorry, forgot to explicitly say that in my post.\n\nFinal edit: \n\nThe people who are agreeing with me are starting to convince me that I'm wrong. To the people calling my parents nasty things in my pms or just saying that they aren't good people: you're dead wrong. My mom is the most caring and kind-hearted woman in the world and I should have made that more clear in my post. \n\nTo be clear, I am also not a monster. I don't mistreat Ally. I get her birthday and Christmas gifts every year. However I am starting to understand that I did do a shitty thing by publicly excluding her at my wedding because I wanted it to be how exactly how I imagined, especially because my mom was apparently blindsided by my feelings.\n\nI was 16-18 when Ally started coming around a lot and I didn't form the same bond everyone else did. I never super liked being around kids, including my sister who by all accounts behaved way worse than Ally ever did. But I recognize that she's become a part of our family. And I think I'm going to make more of an effort to get to know her properly, because I do know she is very mature and intelligent for her age.\n\nAlso, I don't mean to minimize what Maya and Ally have gone through. By saying she wasn't physically abused, I moroso meant to explain why she hadn't been legally removed from her mother's house. She does have extended family that actually cares about her but they live at minimum an hour away so she stays with my parents the majority of the time.\n\nThank you for all of your input.", "created_utc": 1699469413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qskg8/aita_for_excluding_my_adopted_sister_from_family/", "score": 4424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It does seem like you didn't have a chance to develop the same relationship with her as the rest of your family.\n\nShe is family to them. She is not family to you. That is not really anyone's fault, but kinda how the circumstances came out.\n\nYou have no official relationship and no personal relationship. While you could have taken the extra photograph to keep the peace the day of, the fact is, you would have felt weird including someone neither you nor your fiance consider family in a photograph, and likely preferred the photograph without her as is. If that's the one you chose to display at any point, it's just tabling the same fight for another time. She was essentially invited to keep tge peace, as is, not because you wanted to celebrate your wedding with her. You just didn't mind her coming along. It's your wedding day and supposed to be celebrating with family and the people supportive of the couple- which Ally technically is not because you guys have no real relationship. \n\nThere might actually be a slight A H to the parents- if they want you to accept Ally as a sister, what have they actually done to build a relationship between you guys? It kinda seems like they expected you to just have one, and it doesn't work like that with older children. We actually see a lot of that in this sub with step and half siblings- this is really the same scenario. OP just has no personal relationship to Ally, so it makes sense OP would feel weird about a stranger to her being in the wedding photos", "INFO\n\nWhat is Mayas and Ally's relationship? Are they siblings?", "This is a hard one. OP was already 18 when Ally moved in \u201cmost\u201d time. The other siblings and parents spent vastly more time at home with Ally being around almost all the time than OP. If OP wasn\u2019t around to establish a sibling relationship with a child that wasn\u2019t actually adopted full time by her own family, how can you call her an A H for not considering her family?  She\u2019s not OPs sister, never was. Not biologically, not legally, not by choice either. \n\nShe should\u2019ve been included in a bigger family photo, but I can see how OP would not want her in her immediate family- Ally is her SIL\u2019s sister- not immediate family. \n\nThis seems more like a NAH. It\u2019s not Ally\u2019s fault her biological family let her be nearly 100% cared for by another family. There\u2019s no info indicating abuse- could\u2019ve just been dirt poor and couldn\u2019t care for their kids. Still not anyone\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not OP fault for already being grown up and not having a sisterly relationship with a child. It\u2019s also not anyone\u2019s fault OPs parents are super caring and would take in children not belonging to them to give them a better life.", "INFO: Did you do another photo with everyone included?", "I'm so sorry but YTA.\n\nUnless my math is failing me, this child entered your life when you were 16 and she was about 4 and you already had 3 other biological siblings younger than you but older than her. Your words sound resentful as if you started being neglected at that time.\n\nBut you're taking it out on Ally like her sister/babysitter removing her from her really bad home life as a preschooler was her fault. Like she had designs on worming her way into your family.\n\nThat's not what happened. I hope you understand that. Perhaps therapy could help.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY. YTA Because you were a dick to Ally at your wedding. You could have gotten your immediate family photos in a much nicer fashion.\n\nEDIT 2 (because people keep trying to give me information that I already have):I *know* Ally is not adopted. I *know* she is not OP's family. I *know* that Maya is really Ally's sister. I *know* that OP has every \"right\" to exclude whoever she feels like on her wedding day. I *know* she owes Ally nothing. I *still* think she's an AH for the way she behaved. I'm not sure why everybody wants to change my mind about it.\n\nEDIT 3: Michael and Maya's relationship did not start when they were 16. I question my \"math\" because I'm not sure how old people are when they're freshmen. I was 14/15 so I went with 14.", "Wow, massively weird energy on this comment thread.\n\nNTA.\n\nI think a bottom-line principle is that nobody should ever be forced to be family with anyone, PERIOD. All these AITA commenters seem to grasp that just fine when a stepsibling or stepparent is forced onto someone. That framework applies here. \n\nIf you truly are kind to Ally, that's all that you owe her. My god, you are allowed to take a family photo at your wedding.", "It\u2019s crazy that this sub will defend someone\u2019s right to not accept step family but then bash OP for not accepting her brother\u2019s wife\u2019s sister as a member of her family. \n\nNAH", "YTA: you said this girl has be living with you and your family for 8 of her 14 years (since your 24yo brother was 16). more than half of her life, and basically a 3rd of yours. that is a LONG time.

She is very vulnerable to more of the trauma she has already apparently suffered, which is how she ended up in your life to begin with. \n\nI did understand you POV but can't endorse it. You should have enough compassion to be giving, loving and inclusive with this child you say didn't do anything to you or your family aside from joining it. \n\nI'm sorry you felt this way but I'm sorrier you harmed (not just hurt) a 14 year old when you could have approached it so much more diplomatically and kindly. Please do some self reflection then get humble with her and try to repair the damage you have created.", "YTA. You\u2019re just being mean. She\u2019s clearly endeared herself to everyone and she is family since her sister is married to your brother. Why can\u2019t you just accept her?

YTA", "It sounds like this girl has been raised by your parents for more than half of her life at this point. Why would she need to be legally adopted to be considered part of your family? Obviously her birth family doesn't care about her. \n\nI see this as similar to cases where long time romantic partners are excluded because they haven't been technically married. A legal document isn't required to establish a family.\n\nYou singled out a 14 year old girl and made her feel like shit because she doesn't meet your definition of a hardship case. yta.", "I'm not going to make a judgment here but I do want to say, yes, you are entitled to feel how you feel about Ally.  But the rest of your family is also entitled to feel how they feel about you.  If they all feel that Ally is family and she was excluded, then they have that right.  The same way you had the \"right\" to exclude Ally.  Honestly, I think you need therapy.  I'm not at all sure why you are so resentful (there may be good reasons and you may be able to tell your parents what they are).  We don't have to like everyone in our family, but blood, marriage or adoption (or \"adoption\") but what you did is cruel.", "I\u2019m kinda torn with this one: are you an asshole for wanting your wedding and pics the way you want with the people you consider family? No. Could you have handled this better? Yeah. \n\nBut either way you\u2019d have been the bad guy because everyone else values her as a sister whereas you don\u2019t. This was a no win situation for you. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t have to treat her like family. But you didn\u2019t have to make it clear how you felt in this manner.

I was fostered by my aunt and uncle and lived with them and my three cousins (two older, one younger). I was, for the most part, treated well. However, I remember being taken to a Sears photo studio by my cousins who then proceeded to take family photos with our grandmother. I remember being crushed because I was kept out of the photos. Even the photographer was upset for me. That drove the point of my otherness home: I could eat at their table and go to Disney but was not really part of their family. It's been over 30 years but it still stings. This little action has affected me and still does even today.\n\nEdited: yes. I still had my mom and dad.

Maybe it will start with the occasional comment or being excluded from things yourself. You singled her out and let her bio sister in yet not her? The reasoning behind it might be legit, logical,  and real, but the consequences of the actions will show because of this. \n\nEven if not intended you exhibited malicious intent towards a child. That's how everyone will see it. They will talk about you behind your back because of this. Whispering about how cruel you were too her at parties and holiday gatherings later on.

Not all, but it does feel like this is actually an emotionally loaded topic. \n\nYou see OP, Allys reaction to you excluding her, especially public, is rather normal for the kind of abuse she probably experienced. She doesn't feel loved at home. She probably always feels like she isn't really loveable, worth to be loved, and is insecure about belonging into your family. So she will not make a fuss. But she will be incredibly hurt. Because she feels like she belongs nowhere. \nNow, I am sure that your parents will do their best to make her feel welcomed and loved, but for someone with cPTSd from childhood home abuse, this doesn't feel real. And as you said, she isn't legally adopted, so she will feel like an outsider, and any kind of crack, or rejection, especially a public one where no one defends her (they didn't because it was your wedding) Wil just reinforces, that ultimately, she will be abandoned the moment she becomes inconvenient. \n\nOfc OP it's not your responsibility to deal with.

It would be completely reasonable for you to say I want to do a photo with just my immediate relatives, but then also make sure you immediately followed it up with having Ally join for additional photos or Vice versa. Instead it seems like she was asked to join by family members that had no idea you were going to feel this way because you did not express it to anyone beforehand, you kicked her out of the photo, and then proceeded to do exactly nothing else to acknowledge this person as a special individual within your family. I tend to break from people in general on weddings where most seem to feel the wedding is \u201call about the couple\u201d, but in this case it seems this was egregious enough most others also agree you should have been more empathetic and not just decided what you want is all that matters and others feelings be damned. Whether you are as close to her as the rest of your family or not, the rest of your family clearly considers her to be like another member.

You AREN\u2019T entitled to say she isn\u2019t family because to the rest of your family she is and the moment your brother married Maya, Maya became your sister in law and here in Mexico at least, Ally became your \u201cconcu\u00f1ada\u201d which in english would translate to something like co-SIL. So she IS family even if you don\u2019t view her as such.\n\n4. You ARE entitled to not have her at your inmidiate family photo, but then Maya and your baby niece being there doesn\u2019t make any sense, since they are not your primary family. If you wanted a photo with your niece then you didnt just want a photo with your direct family but extended also.\n\n5. And this is the one where I explain why you are the AH: It would have taken NOTHING from you to take a photo that included Ally and one that didn\u2019t. Hell you could have taken one with each of your siblings and in the one with your brother included Maya, your niece and Ally.

The landlord taught them how to ride a bike, even bought them one from his own money.

The landlord passed away quite few years ago. I couldn't get to meet him but I met the landlady. She absolutely loved me because I am the daughter of the kid she so loved. She was like a grandma to me even though we were not even related to her by civic sense. We came from different states and had absolutely no relation.

You included your sister in law and niece in an \"immediate family\" picture, but purposefully excluded Ally since you \"never really liked how she was foisted into\" your lives and \"she's not actually adopted\" I don't get why you're gatekeeping your parents and siblings \"time and resources.\"\n\nSomething that doesn't track with me: What familial connection do you have with Maya but not with Ally. It doesn't seem like you're any closer with Maya than with Ally, so why do you accept Maya as a prt of your family, but not Ally.\n\nTake a step back. Read your title WITHOUT quotations. If she HAD been legally adopted by your parents, would you have acted differently?? If no, you're an asshole for purposefully excluding her for no reason. If yes, you're an asshole for getting hung up on legal technicalities.\n\nYou can do whatever you want for your wedding, but you're still an AH for not just taking at least one more picture with her included.", "Yeesh.\n\nYTA.\n\nI get that it wasn't your choice that she came to live with your family when she did, and maybe it's not cool for your parents to just invite her in and treat her like that if this means that (in any way) you or your siblings got less love, attention, consideration, money or other resources...I can't judge on that because you haven't expanded on it.\n\nBut that's not Ally's fault. She's 14, and by the only context we have you claim that she's a good kid, that you've got no problems with her (you just don't love her), that everyone else seems to really like or adore her, AND that she comes from a bad home environment. \n\nImagine you are 14 with a rocky past but seemingly happy now with your 'surrogate' family, only for one specific member of that group to single you out to tell you that you don't belong here, during an important life-event that's all about love and family.\n\nAnd it's not only rejecting her in the moment; you specifically don't want her in your wedding photo. So that tells her that if you're looking at that picture of one of your happiest days, surrounded by your family, seeing her face would be detrimental to that. That somehow her presence would ruin these pictures. And since this happened in public, most people will think that. So to Ally this is a very public rejection.\n\nThat's a lot man, especially for a kid going through puberty.\n\nThat also doesn't signal that you \"have nothing against her\". If you're really wholly 'neutral' about her then what would it matter if she were in the picture? Especially since you are LITERALLY FAMILY now through your brother's marriage.\n\nAlso just the phrasing of \"I make an effort to be nice to her\" reads to me like you're downplaying the amount of effort it costs you to pretend to be friendly with her. Like, why else would being friendly cost any effort to begin with anyway? Especially if they're a \"good kid\" who is loved or appreciated by most everyone else. So maybe you should be a little more honest in either your post, or possibly with yourself in general.\n\nThe obvious solution to the problem (that wouldn't involve making a 14 year old cry) would have been taking two pictures; one with \"extended family\" and another with 'related by blood' members only (obviously then also excluding Maya).", "Posts like this make me glad my heart is big enough there\u2019s room in it for people like Ally.  Your mom sounds amazing.  I can\u2019t help but wonder if she wonders where she went wrong with you.  It would have been such a simple thing to make Ally feel included and instead, you deliberately chose to leave her out with zero regard for how it would make her feel.

That would be the adult thing to do. Being hurtful toward a young teen, who is clearly doing nothing wrong, is honestly kinda  low.\n\nEven if she is not a sister to you in your mind, she is clearly viewed as a family member by everyone else. Part of the family dynamic is to accept people that the members of that family decide to bring in, because they are important to them. As your family did with your husband for example. No one is forced to love anyone, but you are expected to show acceptance, respect, and kindness to the chosen people of your loved ones. \n\nYou sound a little bitter about the situation around Maya and Ally, like you were wronged somehow. Maybe you were.  If that is the case, put the blame where it is due- with your parents. I bet that deep down it is them that you have issues with, not Ally. Misdirecting your pain and frustration on a young girl is not helping you and is hurting her. Do it for yourself to start healing. Wish you well.", "Yikes, OP.

You validated those little whispers in her head that says she\u2019s not good enough for the people that show her the most love. You should seek counseling and she needs to as well.

No one cares about the technicalities of it. \n\nSo sure, OP can decide winning on this point is what is most important; yes, it is her wedding and Ally is not technically family so can be cast aside. But one thing most people hopefully learn as they age is that sometimes being kind and decent trumps doing just what you want, especially when you can actually get what you want while being kind.  Including Ally in a few pictures would have taken nothing away from OP.  It's not like the old days when film was used and you were really limited in how many pictures you could take. OP could have easily done a number of setups with different people. It wouldn't have taken anything away from her dream wedding pictures, and it would have made it a beautiful family moment.

I've been in a similar situation but had a very different take on this, which is that you can be generous and expansive with who you consider family. If my family considers someone family and they're overall a good person and have done nothing wrong to me or people I care about, then they're a 'relation' and I'll treat them the way I treat extended family. Years ago my aunt and uncle invited my aunt's distant cousin and her preteen son to live with them as they got settled in a new country. My aunt's cousin went through a terrible experience - she was sponsored to immigrate by other relatives of hers and they basically treated her like a domestic slave. This after leaving an abusive ex husband. All this happened while I lived in another country for grad school. Came home at Christmas to a new kid being in the family, calling my grandma 'grandma' in our language, hanging out with the other kids, and no one really explaining what was going on. Asked my mum what the deal was and she explained what had happened. At our Christmas party we took group photos of us cousins. Many of us older cousins didn't really know this kid, but it takes little to show someone some kindness and make them feel included. Helps that he's not a brat and genuinely a sweet kid. They don't live with my aunt and uncle anymore but he's been in the family photos for 10+ years now. I still don't really know him well since I've lived away for so long but that doesn't mean I can't be kind to him.

She is just suddenly there and now we all have these unspoken expectations. I would have loved for my mother to just say, \"hey this is so and so and she is staying with us because x. I love her like my own child and expect you to treat her like your sister.\" \n\nOP yes you are the AH but only because unlike my situation, this girl IS your family by marriage.

And while I completely understand *why,* it's a cruel thing to do to a 14 year old to her face, in front of others at your own wedding.\n\nI would have judged this differently if OP had said, \"Hey Ally, can you sit out for a few 'formal' pictures?\" instead of this.", "She included her niece despite that being an \"extended family\" connection and included the SIL you point out her not bonding with so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Except she included SIL and nibling, they aren\u2019t immediate family either.", "Ally\u2019s father is in prison and OPs own admission, her mother is batshit insane.", "OP said in a comment that Ally's dad is in prison and her mom is Bipolar.

Whether it rises to the level that Ally should be removed is another story.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about this whole story, TBH, and I was in the Ally role when I was high school and even in college. I remember all the times classmates' parents were kind to me. It meant a lot and it still does at my age (late 30s) even though I'm no longer in touch with any of these people. It was never to the extreme of the OP described, but I spent a lot of time at other people's homes. I was given gifts and included.\n\nThat said, I've also seen people in the know talk about how parents who want to foster kids need to consider their non-foster kids. In some ways, Ally is in like a foster kid situation. I think the photo situation could've been theoretically resolved with multiple combinations of people, but the issue isn't the photo.", "Just because she wasn\u2019t removed from her home \u201cofficially\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that her parents may not have been terrible or neglectful.

And just like you said, it's once and done with wedding pictures.\n\nI would want family only pictures too. Some with and without in laws even bc we all know a lot of marriages don't last and it's awkward to have wedding pictures up with sister's husband who left her for the nanny 10 years later.

By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house.\n\nIn no way did I say that she should feel any kind of way about anybody. I am simply talking about how she *treated* Ally here in this instance.", "Nope. OP's post clearly says her brother met Maya when they were freshman in High School. And that Maya basically moved into their home when she was SIXTEEN.", "I\u2019m also shocked at the amount of Y T A.

It doesn\u2019t sound like she was mean about it. Plus ally is not adopted or a foster. She splits her time between OPs parents house and her own. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but ehhh I think people are being harsh to OP", "This happened to me. When I complained to my mother I was told they didn\u2019t have good parents and needed her more. My response was so you take away my parents and give them to them and now they go places and do things with you, they got my bedroom and I moved into the trailer in the back yard, where I still can\u2019t get any privacy because they Keep coming out unsupervised. The only time you even check on me is when you want me to come in and babysit them.   \n\n\nNeedless to say this has a huge impact in the few months they were with us as I\u2019m over 60 and still remember that time with no fondness. I can totally feel the OP\u2019s not wanting to have the girl pushed into the pictures of such a special day.

In-laws, nieces, nephews, and cousins fall outside of immediate but likely still regarded as close family.", "I am surprised at the reaction on this one. First off, huge assumptions are being made about OP resenting/being jealous of Ally, they never shared that and it doesn't sound that way to me, very simply as OP shared, OP doesn't see her as a sister/daughter, while her other family does. Second, it was OPs wedding. This sub loves backing up brides who make decisions for their wedding because it is their day and their decision. OP, the bride, wanted a picture with select people. Her family may view Ally as a sister/daughter but OP doesn't. Maya was in the picture because that is her brothers wife and the mother of OPs niece.\n\nI feel like if worded the right way this posts top comment could easily have been NTA, just so happens the YTA comment got momentum first.\n\nEdit: OP does mention her disagreement on her parents spending time/resources on Ally, I don't view that as resentment, I saw it as disagreeing with their choices.", "this is literally the definition of extended family.", "I am sure the definition could vary, but it typically does not include niblings.", "No they aren\u2019t.

It's not like your brother's new girlfriend of six months who everyone is insisting be in the family photo or something. \n\nOP doesn't have to feel she's another sister but she seems to be unusually unfair, dismissive and a little cruel towards her to the point I feel there's missing information.", "Yeah. I found it hard to pick between the two as well.", "See, I thought that too. And I assume she thought about it. Knowing how her family feels about Ally it makes sense that she would ambush it rather than start an argument that  likely would have boiled over into her family not coming to her wedding.

But, when her \"family\" treats her differently because she excluded someone that the rest of the entire family considers a sister, she may find herself on the outside looking in. She is not required to be invited to family functions because of her actions. Again, her actions aren't necessarily wrong, they are how she feels, but, the rest of the family can do the exact same thing to her when it comes to doing family activities. \n\nShe made this bed and needs to understand that others will do just as she did, what they wanted, despite what she feels about them being \"blood\".", "So actually, I can offer some insight, because I live in a very similiar situation. When I was around 15 and my sister 17, she was dating a guy from school, whose mother had died early and who only had his grandmother and a two other not-so-healthy relatives in his life. They dated for a year and after they broke up, my very charitable mother insisted he was a part of the family and he has been on every family vacation since, for 10ish years.   \n\n\nI can absolutely be honest and say I have also been frustrated or jealous about this, because sometimes it seems like he gets special treatment, and he never gets in real trouble like my sister and I do. Aside from that, I do not gain or lose anything by him being included. It is important to my family and although him and I are not super close, nor is he very emotional about it, I know it has completely changed his life to have a consistent, real family to rely on. We hardly talk, other than on christmas or family events, but I absolutely included him on our family photos during my wedding. Why wouldn't I? If you have that many siblings already, does one person more really destroy the whole pic? I can understand where OP is coming from and I know there are many mixed feelings to be had. But in this case, absolutely YTA. You have the luxury of a fairly normal family that cares. Have a heart and just share.

She has every right not to see ally as a sister or family member", "thats how i feel about it, if the only thing that stops her from being adopted at this point is paper work, then shes already adopted. \n\nthe parents may have wanted ot formally adopt her and the real parent didnt let them. there are a lot of shitty parents out there that will let someone else raise their child for them with out actually giving them p for adoption. this seems like one of those case. \n\nthe people arguing that shes not family are arguing semantics. if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its a duck.", "I didn't read it as resentment, more as not agreeing with the situation but to each their own!", "From the story it seems OP got the people she wanted together and her mother invited Ally, causing all this. Totally agree with living with the consequences but in this case OP is getting my vote, it is THEIR wedding, if she has a reasonable wish within her power/rights as a bride, it is others job to accept those wishes. \n\nThe situation sucks for Ally, I agree it would have been pretty easy to get a few with her afterwards, but I also can see that being overlooked after the surprise/stress of her being invited up by someone else. I can also see OP just flat out not wanting to do that and I think that is her right given this is her wedding, not Ally's. \n\nOP shared she wasn't excluded from any other photos, seems just these ones and as someone who used to work at weddings, it is very common to have 1 or more photo sessions within the wedding with select people.", "If she had decided to take two pictures the reaction would likely have been the same. OP wouldn't be able to win in the situation.", "It's just crazy. Even if Ally was adopted and OP just didn't like her, it'd be her right to exclude her (though in that case it would be a little ruder, I suppose). I really don't get why these comments are so nuts today.", "True, I don't really get why this particular post is getting grief. Agreed that there are probably a lot of people just incapable of seeing things sensibly.\n\nI think the bit about Ally having a rough background has got way too many people feeling sympathy for her. That's sad and all but she isn't owed anything by OP.", "Agreed and I don't know why it should matter, but it's the only thing I can see that's different about the story.", "Rejection too!  OP rejected and publicly humiliated a child from a broken home who found a semblance of a \"real\" home with that family.  \n\nEdit: removed redundancy", "Yup, no way was OP getting out of this one unscathed without being a total doormat on her wedding.", "Seems like she is to OP", "I mean she isn't really saying THEY can't consider her family. Just that they themselves don't.\nI'm pretty on the fence but idk if I see anything wrong with that.\nI think it's weird to care enough to single her out and exclude her.\nOp should have done a group family shot with her, parents only  and siblings only to avoid this.\nBut I can't fault her for feeling how she feels.", "There are people on /r/photoshoprequest that LIVE and compete for opportunities like this.\n\nThey do amazing work.", "I would say that I don't understand why this didn't happen, but given the overall tone of the post I do see why. \n\nOP, you aren't the ah for not loving her as family. But YTA for the way you handled this. A variety of photos would have been easy, a graceful thing on your part, and it would have saved a teenager the embarassment of being not just rebuffed, but rebuffed in front of others. I presume you were once a 14 year old too, to be able to know how that might feel? (It sucks at any age but 14 is emotional prime time). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you'd go a long way towards mending this by talking to Ally and explaining that while you didn't mean to hurt her feelings, you did anyway, and you regret that (only if you mean it because it will be very obvious and even more hurtful if you don't). If you can't see your way to that outcome then be prepared to have that continue being an issue with your family.", "And OP had a brain - this girl was in pictures, just not the family photo they wanted for their own wedding.", "the comment from op about her \"Having her own family\" shows how much she does not understand the circumstances.\n\nIf she is \"unofficially\" adopted into another family without her parents even giving custody, or being present. They are not her family, they are just birthers.\n\nOP doesn't have to embrace her as a sister but it's fucked up to imply she could be with her \"own\" family when they are clearly extremely neglectful and absent. What family? The girl has no one but her sister, and some knows some people who don't even care where she sleeps", "Yep I think a good summary of this situation is \"You can be right and still be an asshole\". OP is right that she doesn't need to force a relationship with Ally if she doesn't want to, but she should still be kind and thus is still an asshole specifically for purposely excluding a 14 year old from photos and hurting her feelings. Like most people said, just take some photos with her and some photos without her. It didn't need to be a big deal, but OP made it a big deal.\n\nThe most tactful way would have been to take photos of the bride and groom + parents, then add the siblings, then add Maya + baby, then add Ally right at the end. Then they have loads of photos of every possible combo of people and no one is hurt or left out.", "I am sad to agree. Unlike a sibling's significant other, which can end in a breakup, this girl is likely to be part of your extended family for a long time. \n\nA better course would have been to foreseen this picture and told the photographer. The photographer could have arranged the family to put this girl at one end, making it ridiculously easy to edit the picture. My wife does this all the time with her pixel phone to delete background people who randomly end up in a picture.", ">Especially since she's including Ally's sister as \"immediate\" family.\n\nBecause Ally's sister *married her brother*.", "16 and 4 actually --OP's brother amd her SIL got together at 14 and are now 24..OP is 26 and Ally is 14.", "My sister was born when I was 11 and honestly I can still relate to op. But I'd never exclude her. Wouldn't matter if it was my sister or a friend of my sister who basically lived with us, even if I'm not close to them, I'd still call them family.", "What has a child free wedding got to do with OP\u2019s post? Clearly there were children there - Michael and Maya\u2019s child was even included in the photos. There must be in even bigger age gap between OP and her nibbling, so they must not have anything in common either apparently.", "Fuck yes it is the same thing.\n\nFamily isn't about genetics.", "My oldest siblings were born when I was 13. I don't have much in common with them, but I still treat them like family, because they are in fact family. I feel for OP, but being petty to a teenager usually makes you the bad guy.", "Same experience here.... found out afterwards they broke up before the wedding and didn't want to \"ruin\" it for us so they played happy couple for the wedding... \n\nSo now I have a metric ton of wedding photos with my brother's ex fiance in them. At least she refrained from being in 1 and only 1 of my immediate family.", "Ally is not thier child ally is maya sister", "In my book that\u2019s family. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s half sister on her dads side? Family. \n\nMy Aunt\u2019s best friend who\u2019s come to every family event since I was a child ? Family. That best friend\u2019s kids? My cousins. \n\nThe woman my Aunt took in as a little girl because she was being abused? That\u2019s my cousin. Not blood? She is now and I\u2019ll fight anyone who says otherwise. \n\nIt sounds like OPs family understands that families can be formed by blood and by love. \n\nOP on the other hand seems to suffer from a lack of empathy and a bit of jealousy. She seems like she couldn\u2019t wait to put this girl in her place. \n\nIt\u2019s not just what she did, it\u2019s how she did.", "Well I also think that mentioning that the child had a bad home life has resulted in everyone on here jumping on a \u201cyou\u2019re bullying an abused child\u201d bandwagon. Let\u2019s be honest, if the home life is that bad and the parents haven\u2019t involved the appropriate government agency, then they\u2019re pretty shitty too.", "I don\u2019t think she singled her out. It was OP\u2019s mom that asked Ally to be in the picture. I don\u2019t think I see OP as jealous or in the wrong. She just wanted her immediate family in the picture.  Ally not her sister. Ally was never adopted. Ally is her brother\u2019s wife\u2019s lil sister. Why is everyone making OP to be the AH ? I really do not get it.", "I have a super convoluted family because both parents were married multiple times to other people who had been married multiple times. Some I consider family & some I don\u2019t, regardless of the dna & bloodlines involved. Would I have taken a bunch of different picture combos with & without \u201csister\u201d? Yes, I would, just to keep peace. But, I wouldn\u2019t have been upset had another quasi-family member not had my comfort first in their mind on a wedding day. Ultimately, I would say NTA - your pics, your wedding, your money, your choice. But I agree that OP wanting family only pics isn\u2019t a targeted slight - she just wants family wedding pics & doesn\u2019t want an extra family member she didn\u2019t choose in her forever photos. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation all around", "why go to that trouble when you are literally paying for a photographer.", "She was maybe in random pictures that the photographer took of the event. You know, candids.", "Also her family is her sister who is married to OPs brother. Like.. even if shes not adopted she IS part of OPs family", "This sounds awesome. Not EXCLUDE her but ADD her, and done by the photographer.\n\nOP would have her pictures, and Ally would not be hurt.", "THIS!!! This is what happens at most weddings!!!! If OP seriously oversaw this then they\u2019re ridiculous.", "This seems just as bad...once the pics would come out they'd know anyway and be just as hurt.", "I don't think Ally would feel much better if she saw a photo with herself edited out...", "That's not what is generally considered to be immediate family. That's an in-law.   \n\n\nMost people consider their immediate family to be their parents, their siblings, their own spouse, and their own children. If you refer to them with some modifier, like \"sister IN-LAW\" or by describing them by their relation to someone else, like \"my brother's wife,\" that's not immediate family. Sure, some people may operate by other definitions, but given how much OP seems to resent this kid in particular, I'm guessing her use of \"immediate\" was one of convenience, not one of conviction.", "Right, it's the entire household *minus Ally because of a technicality*. Plus the bottom line is that she deeply hurt the feelings of a 14 year old.... For the sake of pictures? God that's so petty.", "Yeah okay, you\u2019re right. I agree that family isn\u2019t about genetics. \n\n\nI still don\u2019t think Op is the AH for not wanting this girl in the photos, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t family to the parents (something I never said). Even if she\u2019s a blood sibling, cousin, adopted sister that still doesn\u2019t mean that Op considers her her sister, she has every right to get the photos she wants on her wedding day regardless of relation.", "Right, and Ally isn't family to her. She's not blood related, nor is she part of OP's chosen family. Is OP not allowed to choose who she considers family?", "Do you think she planned her family photo with the mindset of \u201cfuck that 14 year old, I hate her and will exclude her\u201d and not \u201cthese people are the photo I want to print for my wall\u201d. \n\n\n\nI think that\u2019s what I\u2019m stuck on, is that everyone is like Op was mean or Op was intentionally rejecting this girl. When it\u2019s probably not like that, it\u2019s okay to hold some people closer and that doesn\u2019t mean that the others are rejected.", "Yes, but Maya and Michael share a child, so the relationship to Maya is completely different than that to Ally, who's just the sister of her brothers wife. That's why Maya and her child was in the picture and Ally wasn't.", "Yeah that\u2019s distant enough to be reasonable to not include.", "Your idea of family is the same as mine! I like our definitions best, and they show love and family is more than DNA. \n\nI feel so sorry for Ally. I hope the rest of the family sincerely consoles Ally, and Ally will be assured the others love and care for her unconditionally.", "Reddit gets weird about family. Really don't think it's fair that OP is getting shit for this, she doesn't have to like Ally. Dang, people aren't on good terms with actual blood relatives, let alone a sister of your SIL.", "Is she really likely to ever see the photo?", "tbh,  based on her comment, she isn't all that fond of maya either. maya was in the pic because of newborn niece (Maya's child) who op wanted in the pic.", "Hmmm, disagree with that. At least in my family on both sides the spouses of siblings are also considered immediate family. It's definitely something that will differ from person to person. The OP has a more immediate relation to Maya then she has to Ally.", "She may have permanently damaged the relationship between herself and her brother as well. It's unlikely there will be anymore pictures with her SIL or her niece.", "Being allowed to do something doesn't mean there aren't consequences.\n\nImagine if she just decided that a blood brother isn't family to her,  not because he had done anything but just because she didn't feel close to him - perhaps he was much older or younger and they never ever lived together.\n\nOf course she has the right to do it.\n\n\nBut of course the family is going to think she's an asshole for it \ud83e\udd37\n\nCan't have your cake and eat it too.", "The thing with wedding photos though is that you get a LOT of them. Photographers take tons of photos, and it\u2019s even recommended that you provide your photographer a list of all the family portrait configurations ahead of time. \n\nThe kind and logical solution here would be to have some photos with in-laws (Ally and Maya) included, and some with parents and siblings only. That way, Ally isn\u2019t conspicuously absent from the family portraits, and OP still gets the immediate family photos she wanted.", "Yeah--that's where I am on this, on the fence.\n\nI have plenty of unrelated people I consider second moms, substitute dads, aunts, uncles, and cousins. That's just the way the relationship between us has evolved. Love them to pieces. They will be invited to my wedding but I don't anticipate taking my  'official family picture' with them in it. Probably will take another picture with as many in it as I can fit, though.\n\nFrom OP's 'tone' I get the feeling that rather than being resentful of Ally per se,  that OP feels like her family was taken advantage of by Maya and Ally's parents. She saw or heard that her parents were essentially housing and supporting both these young girls when they have parents of their own that seemingly were neglectful. She doesn't get to dictate her parents/family's reaction to that, but has every right not to view Ally as a sister. And if she didn't feel like she wanted her in the picture? It seems like she was well within her rights.\n\nETA: OP's comments say that Ally's dad is in prison and mom is bipolar, leading to unpleasant interactions due to the mom. So I think it's more so resentment from OP that her parents felt they needed to parent/support Maya and Ally.  \n\nI do question why Ally wouldn't be spending more time at her sister's home now that she's established? If I were in the same situation, it might be cool for my in laws to welcome my sister, but I'd feel like she needed to be with me at my home when she wants to get away from mom's behaviors.", "It\u2019s just a picture on her wedding day. She wants her family in the picture, it takes like 5 seconds and done. I don\u2019t see the need to wage war over this.  I understand the rest of her family see Ally as \u2018their family\u2019 and that\u2019s okay and even great.  It\u2019s also okay that OP doesn\u2019t see Ally as \u2018her sister\u2019 which she really isn\u2019t.  I also think OP is much older so she probably did not get to bond with a random kid that showed up at her house all the time.", "Agreed. Everyone says you can pick your family until you don\u2019t pick a child. Then you are a monster.", "Oof, yeah. OP is placing a lot of value on blood, but her parents chose to \"have\" Maya and Ally every much as they chose to have her or her blood related siblings. OP doesn't have to feel any kind of way about them, but it seems like she's also having trouble understanding why everyone else treats them as family. Either way, Maya and Ally aren't to blame for their circumstances.", "I consider my SIL my immediate family but she wasnt in the pictures I took with my blood relatives at my wedding and she was fine with that because it was literally me, my brother, my mom and my dad. To me if the SIL is close enough to immediate family then her little sister who has spent a decade in the house is too.", "Yeah, agreed she probably didn't bond with Ally. Personally I think OPs mom is TA for assuming Ally would be welcome just because she thinks of her as a daughter."]}
