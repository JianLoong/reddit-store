These are the fashions, and teens enjoy pushing the boundaries of self-expression.\n\nI think you should sit down and have an adult talk with your daughter about why you were concerned, why you are upset she lied, and why it's a big deal. Then apologize for making her feel that she can't talk to you and promise to have actual conversations about issues like this going forward. Shes' 16, definitely old enough to have well-thought opinions, so set a standard that if she disagrees with a decision you'll be willing to have a calm discussion on her view and then find a compromise. If it's truly silly, you might even \"give in completely\" on occasion.  This way you are actually teaching her how to make good choices, how to compromise, and building trust instead of an environment where she feels so certain you'll ignore her thoughts that she hides things from you.\n\nI also recommend letting her choose the punishment. She's old enough to recognize mistakes, and she doesn't need the same punishment schema now that she did at 10. After you have talked about why lying is dangerous, and apologized for making her feel she could not trust you, ask her what she thinks an appropriate punishment for the lying would be. She might go too harsh, out of an attempt to regain your trust and love, so I'd steer her towards something like a week of no screen or friend time. This would give you some bonding time to help repair the relationship, and if she isn't throwing fits I would recommend doing things together to prevent boredom, such as museums or galleries or coffee out together.

If we all just listneed to our elders no progress would ever be made.", "Being comfortable with your body has nothing to do the fact that she is a minor who was wearing a uniform that\u2019s sole purpose is to objectify women. Hooters won\u2019t even hire or sell those uniforms to girls that young.", "Hm. Fair point.", "No. Just no.", "Thank you.", "We\u2019re all gonna have different views of expression and modesty but no, even at 16 she is a child and just because she doesn\u2019t like a rule doesn\u2019t mean you lie and do why you want. That\u2019s such an immature stance", "At 18, yes. At 16, parents still get to weigh in.", "She lied about what she was wearing, calm down", "You must be 16 yourself. This is not being strict or overbearing. It is a reasonable request that an underage child does not go out wearing a sexually charged hooters costume. She is a parent, not a friend and sometimes that means making decisions the child will not like.", "Yeah it\u2019s a work uniform that\u2019s sole purpose is to objectify women\u2019s bodies. Not the same as a regular work uniform and you know that damn well.", "you\u2019re a moron", "Thanks, that\u2019s fair. It was a modified costume (more revealing) but I get your point.", "You can\u2019t be serious.", "She's 16? You obviously don't have children", "User name checks out", "What in the world does lying to her parent about her outfit have to do with the possibility of her getting sexually assaulted???? What???", "Women don\u2018t get raped because of the amount of clothes they\u2019re wearing. That is an absolutely vile and didgusting comment to make.", "Are you kidding me? 16 is almost 10 years away from having a fully developed brain. Parents ARE there to protect their children and make sure they don\u2019t do dumb shit. You must be a teenager.", "Ew. You\u2019re supporting a child wearing an outfit meant to show T and A for tips from objectifying dudes? Parents are supposed to be there for their children to make sure they don\u2019t put themselves in jeopardy. The topic of childhood autonomy is not nearly as black and white as you\u2019re making it.", "Then why did you reply", "Sells sexuality?", "Nice", "Really?", "Thanks!", "A parent disapproving isn\u2019t going to stop the 16 year old wanting to do the thing. Even though you\u2019re not wrong, OP would be better off having frank and honest discussions with their teenager, rather than making them feel like their decisions are being vetted.", "No, it isn't wrong to not want it. I agreed that OP is in the right for being uncomfortable with it. But sixteen-year-olds are going to find a way to do most of whatever they want to do. Parents can encourage open communication so they are aware of what's going on and at least have a voice in their teen's ear, or they can take an authoritarian stance and put up a wall between themselves and their kids.", "OP was definitely policing his daughter's body.   And it's wrong to do that.   Op had an opportunity to have a frank discussion about sexuality, consent, and appearances, and to learn why his daughter chose to wear the costume she did.   He didn't take that.", "I don\u2018t understand the pearl clutching going on here over Hooters waitresses? They\u2019re waitresses, noy strippers. My dad took me to Hooters all the\n\ntime when I was a child, and  \nI turned out fine.   \nAlso, the uniforms aren\u2019t that skimpy\n\nanymore. It\u2019s a full length\n\ntop, not croppeed anymore. The shorts are short, yes but no shorter\n\nthan what a high school girl\u2019s volleyball\n\nteam would wear. Or someone dressibg in 80\u2019s workout clothes.   \nFuthermore, a 16 YO sees more tits and skilly clothes on Instagram or during a beer commercial for a football game than they do at\n\nHooters. Hooters is actually pretty  family friendly in comparison. Hooters girls aren\u2018t strippers or pornstars.", "Oh I see!  I thought she took the pic to deliberately \u201ctell on\u201d your daughter.", "a work uniform... for a job literally intended to objectify women for the pleasure and enjoyment of men. its not an appropriate outfit for a minor to wear. if she was 18 she can wear whatever she wants but 16 year olds should not be wearing hooters uniforms. theres a reason you have to be 18+ to work there.", "Just to point out an outfit adults wear specifically to make more tips by being objectified by idiot dudebros.\n\nThe whole point is to show some titties and ass to get guys horny and stupid to tip more\n\n16 is not 26.", "She hid it because she knows her mom would be upset that her 16 year old child is dressing in revealing clothing\u2026 Like most parents would. Trying to push this \u201cyou broke your kids trust\u201d or whatever narrative onto this story really takes away from actual unsavory situations where kids need to hide things from their parents in order to feel safe.", "You are right. Minor children don't always have the same personal freedom of choice that adults do. This isn't a new concept, though. I had a curfew when I was 16. (Hated it). When I turned 18 and moved out, I didn't anymore. I totally survived.  ;)", "Maybe she hid it bc she\u2019s being a teenage brat who refuses to take no for an answer.", "It's not untrue that acting out against authority is a pretty normal, healthy teenager behavior. I am think the OP is a little uptight but not in an \"abusive parent \" range. I agree it's complicated, and we don't have all the details of their relationship from one interaction expressed from only mom's point of view.\n\nGetting caught disobeying authority and experiencing consequences can also have its place in normal development, though. I can for sure say that most adult lives involve a combination of freedom with a need to follow rules we don't like.", "This is my thought. My friend had an awesome mum who I believe did it right for the most part. My friend went to her about pretty much everything, she always knew where we were even when it was questionable (under the premise of they will phone her if any trouble because they don\u2019t fear consequences) but she still totally lied to her about shit like this. If she ever put her foot down and said no not okay she did it anyway because teens push boundaries/always think they\u2019re right. There\u2019s a balance but never a perfect one.", "Well, you need to explain that. There's a world of possibilities there.", "She has experimented with wearing sexy things, which is natural, but I prefer she do that at home.", "That's exactly it. I'm pretty unhappy with some of the corporate BS in my otherwise enjoyable job. As a mature individual, I understand that if I handle that upset by thwarting the rules I don't agree with and trying to deceive them, I run a fair risk of being fired.", "At their own peril. Just because the kid is 16 it doesn't mean it doesn't affect the intra personal relationship.", "This is exactly what I was thinking... like it's not that deep...", "I am perfectly calm. These are reasonable responses and strategies to help the 16yo feel heard and respected while still ensuring her safety.", "ok boomer whatever you say.", "I haven't got a problem at all with how a woman chooses to earn her money and this post isn't even about that. It's about a 16 year old hiding from her mother and lying to her to avoid feeling the wrath of being looked down upon", "Me? Why?", "I have two sons.  And a Hooters girl outfit is FAR less revealing than any bathing suit. Stop with the moral indignation.", "This really made me LOL", "Damn right, hon!  lol!", "They also have agency and do have understanding on consequences. They are not children", "There happy..", "Well I suppose you *can*, but what are you hoping to teach her when you encourage her to cover up?", "the way op is going about it isnt right for sure but its gross to say not wanting your 16 year old daughter to wear sexual outfits is \"policing her body\"", "pretty sure op is her mom. and shes 16. shes protecting her young, minor daughter. i will not be budging on this.", "Oh! Sorry I wasn\u2019t more clear!", "literally exactly", "You're right, kids don't have the same personal autonomy. But we're not talking 6, we're talking 16. we're not talking about backpacking for 6 months but wearing a bog standard \"sexy costume\".", "I wouldn't call her a brat. It's normal healthy teenage behavior to act against authority and push for as much freedom as possible. That doesn't mean she should get to do whatever she wants.", "It's definitely a juggling act. That said though, I think that once communication and trust are established, there are compromises that could be made. A good trusting relationship would allow the daughter to ask, and when OP explained why the hooters outfit wouldn't work at 16 they could have gone together to costume shop. It would not have been hard to find a balance between sexy and parent-approved at Spirit.", "The last paragraph in my post?", "That\u2019s the thing\n\nPeople like to get fired up for \u201cmah freedoms\u201d. Cool I\u2019m not a fan of super strong oppression and I recognize I like modesty a bit more than some but it definitely isn\u2019t a blanket \u201cok\u201d as some want to think\n\nThere are always consequences so need to be ready to deal with it", "True, and I think mom's being a little uptight. However, Mom's not being so far out of normal parenting range to be called abusively controlling. Unless it goes far beyond her not wanting her 16 year old to dress in a hooters costume, I doubt we are at intrapersonal relationship destroying conflict here. My parents would have flipped over this. I would probably let her.\n\nOn a related note:  I am the only one who thought letting my 16 year old niece have a sip of wine with us would discourage (by normalizing and making it less taboo) rather than encourage alcohol use. Apparently, I am unusually permissive and got overruled.", "As a parent it absolutely is that deep. Your responsibility is to raise thoughtful, empathetic, capable humans. That means it's important to analyze what methods work or do not work, whether your methods remain appropriate as your child ages, whether you are nurturing their confidence and capability or hindering it. You have to be able to listen and HEAR what they are saying, and compromise while still maintaining leadership. \n\nIf you have a child and consider parenting \"not that deep\", I am concerned.", "Again, she lied about what she was wearing. And your comment is massively over dramatic about that", "Lol", "They are children. They do not have fully developed brains. 16 is still a child, and until you are a fully developed adult, you will not understand that.", "No one is saying that the outfit is appropriate or that OP is wrong for being uncomfortable with it. We\u2019re simply suggesting that this teen is her own person with her own mind and can make decisions for herself, so taking an authoritarian approach isn\u2019t going to teach her to be safe.", "i am so concerned with all these comments oh my lord!!! my sister is 18 and when she was 16 i would absolutely have had to sit her down and have a big-bro talk if she had done something like this. absolutely not appropriate at all and very sad", "I'd let her wear it. However, it's within the boundaries of a fairly normal diversity of parenting.", "You're not understanding. **What happened** in the argument that might make you an asshole?", "It really isn't.  My comment was full of nuanced advice for MOM. I addressed the lying and recommended what I saw as reasonable consequences, and then discussed the psychology/impact of what I saw. \n\nWhen you treat children I hope that you consider these approaches (speak to them respectfully, build trust by showing them you understand they are capable of discussing things with you, and seek understanding when they are fighting your treatment plan), as they are very effective at building trustful communication. Obviously I hope the same when you have children.", "Haha I love how you think people who have differing opinions to you are not adults.\n\nI am a doctor working in paediatrics, part of my job is understanding the capacity of children of various ages. 16yos have capacity, are intelligent and capable of making a lot of their own choices. Including what they wear...", "I think OP is thinking she\u2019s TA for confronting her daughter and being upset that her daughter went behind her back by wearing something that was not approved.", "You looked into my profile? Wow. You are a bit intense"]}
