We have tried to have many firm but positive discussions with them. \nWe rent our house from them at about mortgage rate. When my husband worked at the family business it was taken directly out of his pay. He\u2019s now switched jobs and we realized that about $100-$125 extra a month was being taken out without our knowledge. We asked about it and were told that it was for an old loan (that we had thought we already paid off & they couldn\u2019t provide accurate information for) but it could be \u201cforgiven\u201d now. They had already taken over 3k by the time my husband switched jobs. \nNow, two weeks later, we need a lease signed within a year to access insurance for our daughters life saving medication. \nThey sent the lease over without mentioning that they had written in an increase for the same amount as what they were taking without our knowledge before, a new & more than 2x higher security deposit, and a clause about being able to enter at any time. \nWhen I asked about this they claimed most of it was a mistake and they would redraft it. However, the rent increase was correct. \nI replied that while they could make any increases, I was offended that they did so without notice (as stated in our last lease) and asked for clarification on the old \u201cloan\u201d situation since this the amounts were exactly the same. \nI was ignored about that & told that a new lease would be sent over.\nI stated that from our perspective it felt like the money was stolen from us and that they were taking the opportunity of our daughter needing medication to corner us instead of just having an open and honest conversation. That I would need to think about that and how it impacts our families relationship. \nThey sent a long text chewing me out for demanding perfection and holding them to impossible standards with our kids in this and every other situation. \nI replied honestly that they have the lowest standards of anyone in the family when it comes to our children and if they felt they were too high then I would be making a decision for their safety, not compromising my standards. I also mentioned that the fact that my husband had to have therapy for the trauma they caused him growing up is between them but my children would never know that pain.", "created_utc": 1694567094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h90kb/aita_for_telling_my_in_laws_they_can_either_meet/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If any of the problems with the new rental agreement stop us from signing then we will be denied. There is another insurance company that we considered but their monthly payments are much higher. We wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it for long. My daughters medication is $700 without insurance so we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the schools supply and our home supply before she needs it. \nOur therapist has suggested going no contact when my husband is ready. He truly loves his father and these situations and acknowledging the past really hurts him. He is trying to work towards being at a place where he is ready. In the meantime I continue to advocate for our kids and try to create healthy boundaries. Our visits have lessened significantly and the boundaries such as not feeding one of our toddlers what the other is allergic to while they\u2019re eating together and locking up the foods that contain severe allergens have been seen as setting impossible standards and met with resentment. \nThe rent is slightly more than the last house we rented but it is larger because it has a semi finished basement. It is less than our neighbors pay but not less than other houses with the same amount of bedrooms. The house was bought for us to rent, sold to them by their friend at a much reduced price. However, it is fully within their rights to raise the rent. I have no issue with them making landlord decisions. I am only upset that it looks as if they were stealing from us and then used a medical opportunity to raise it without mentioning anything. If they had approached us with a proper notice or conversation when they realized they needed more from the property, I would not be upset. \nI have no idea what taking the unknown money out of his account would be considered. It started when he switched to salary. The rental funds as well as the additional was taken out weekly and before we saw any of the money. This is why it had taken so long to be noticed. There was an aspect of trust that they were taking the correct amount and a new pay situation.", "It sounds as though, when her husband was working for his parents, he was getting insurance through their company as an employee.  \n\nMy guess is that there was an understanding that the insurance would continue even though he had a new job. And that his parents are threatening to end his insurance coverage if they don't sign the higher-cost lease.\n\nThat's assuming they are in the US with the system of employer provided health insurance through private for-profit companies.", "NTA - If they are treating your kids like crap then forsure limit the amount they see them. Honestly, if you can afford it, why rent? Why not just buy and get equity in your home rather than help them by paying for their second house. If it is par with a mortgage, you might as well be paying a mortgage ngl. Business and family never mix. Also, protecting your kids from bs is always the number 1 priority.", "Op went in to detail in comment that they are terrible about making sure one kids doesn\u2019t get given food with allergy or around that food.", "Sorry about that. \nSo the rent is not an issue with me. As landlords they\u2019re allowed to raise it. \nI am frustrated by the circumstances with my husbands pay that surround it, but really I am upset that instead of bringing this up or increasing it with notice before when they realized they needed more from the property, it waited until a time where we asked for the rental agreement to be renewed due to requirements from the new insurance company, they made the changes without mentioning anything, there were additional fees and stipulations, and we are on a deadline from the insurance so if we do not agree to whatever is in the agreement then my daughter will go without her medication. This medication is what prompted the new rental agreement. \nIt feels like they took the opportunity of my childs health needs to corner us into making agreements on the lease when all they had to do was send us a notice or communicate that before. We have been out of lease for a year and a half (? Something like that) and they could have renewed it at any point with any changes and it not impact our daughters health. \nBut now we have been forced into a position to choose her health and agree to any changes instead of being able to fully consider if we wanted to continue to rent with those changes. \nIt felt like they were using my daughters need for medication to manipulate us. \nSo I stated that and how I had taken offense to that and that I would need to consider what this meant for our families. \nI don\u2019t want someone who will use her medical needs to manipulate us to continue to have access to her. This is established with their continuing resentment for any conversations we have about their care.
