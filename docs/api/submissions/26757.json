If any of the problems with the new rental agreement stop us from signing then we will be denied. There is another insurance company that we considered but their monthly payments are much higher. We wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it for long. My daughters medication is $700 without insurance so we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the schools supply and our home supply before she needs it. \nOur therapist has suggested going no contact when my husband is ready. He truly loves his father and these situations and acknowledging the past really hurts him. He is trying to work towards being at a place where he is ready. In the meantime I continue to advocate for our kids and try to create healthy boundaries. Our visits have lessened significantly and the boundaries such as not feeding one of our toddlers what the other is allergic to while they\u2019re eating together and locking up the foods that contain severe allergens have been seen as setting impossible standards and met with resentment. \nThe rent is slightly more than the last house we rented but it is larger because it has a semi finished basement. It is less than our neighbors pay but not less than other houses with the same amount of bedrooms. The house was bought for us to rent, sold to them by their friend at a much reduced price. However, it is fully within their rights to raise the rent. I have no issue with them making landlord decisions. I am only upset that it looks as if they were stealing from us and then used a medical opportunity to raise it without mentioning anything. If they had approached us with a proper notice or conversation when they realized they needed more from the property, I would not be upset. \nI have no idea what taking the unknown money out of his account would be considered. It started when he switched to salary. The rental funds as well as the additional was taken out weekly and before we saw any of the money. This is why it had taken so long to be noticed. There was an aspect of trust that they were taking the correct amount and a new pay situation.", "It sounds as though, when her husband was working for his parents, he was getting insurance through their company as an employee.  \n\nMy guess is that there was an understanding that the insurance would continue even though he had a new job.

As landlords they\u2019re allowed to raise it. \nI am frustrated by the circumstances with my husbands pay that surround it, but really I am upset that instead of bringing this up or increasing it with notice before when they realized they needed more from the property, it waited until a time where we asked for the rental agreement to be renewed due to requirements from the new insurance company, they made the changes without mentioning anything, there were additional fees and stipulations, and we are on a deadline from the insurance so if we do not agree to whatever is in the agreement then my daughter will go without her medication. This medication is what prompted the new rental agreement. \nIt feels like they took the opportunity of my childs health needs to corner us into making agreements on the lease when all they had to do was send us a notice or communicate that before. We have been out of lease for a year and a half (? Something like that) and they could have renewed it at any point with any changes and it not impact our daughters health. \nBut now we have been forced into a position to choose her health and agree to any changes instead of being able to fully consider if we wanted to continue to rent with those changes. \nIt felt like they were using my daughters need for medication to manipulate us. \nSo I stated that and how I had taken offense to that and that I would need to consider what this meant for our families. \nI don\u2019t want someone who will use her medical needs to manipulate us to continue to have access to her. This is established with their continuing resentment for any conversations we have about their care.

Which was paid weekly. The money was taken out before we ever saw it. So there was a level of trust there.

I am not upset that they need to increase the rent. \nI am upset that instead of having a conversation or giving a notice, that they tried to slip it into the new lease without saying anything at a time that we initiated the rental agreement to be renewed because our insurance gave us a time limit on getting an in date lease. Instead of being a normal landlord situation it now feels as if they\u2019re manipulating us with my daughters health needs into signing something that they thought we wouldn\u2019t before. \nI don\u2019t mind paying a little extra rent, I am upset that it was presented at a time where we would have to sign whatever they included to get the medication my daughter needs.", "We were renting separately until we started the home buying process. The in-laws friend was willing to sell this home to them cheap, so they bought it. We moved in with the understanding that we would be buying it off of them. When they presented us with the first rental agreement they said that it was just for the HOA and that we could buy the home at any time. However, every time we have brought it up we have either been completely ignored or the subject has been changed. We stopped making upgrades to the home a year in because of this. We moved in and lived there for a year with the understanding that this would be our forever home. We have since realized they probably aren\u2019t going to sell (which is their right).

They had conversations with my husband about how it was the same lease. \nOr they could do the rental agreement for a shorter period. It only stated that it had to be signed in the last year, not how long the lease had to be.

That is their right. \nI care how it was done.", "just because they are doing them a favor doesn't change that they are blatantly trying to take advantage of them, and being assholes about the way they are going about it. this is their son and dil. there was no reason for the lease to have changed the way it did without having had some kind of discussion with them", "I think you are thinking too much into it. Your rent should have been increased 18 months ago. Instead of focusing on that you are asking why it is increased now.
