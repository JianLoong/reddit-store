I also feel like he had been making an effort to talk to me more recently and has been a bit flirty around me.

He said that it was just an accident and he hadn\u2019t really changed his behavior much.\n\nIn addition, we both teach younger students, middle school age, and a few girls he taught created a whiteboard heart with my name and his inside a heart. I realize this isn\u2019t good evidence at all, but it\u2019s something I feel like I should mention. \n\nAnyways, since this whole ordeal, I\u2019ve been really uncomfortable around him and I don\u2019t sit next to him in class anymore. Joe has told me that I\u2019m being slightly homophobic, and a few mutual friends think I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t think I am and I feel like I\u2019m not doing anything wrong.
