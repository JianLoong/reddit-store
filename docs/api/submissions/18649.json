My sister (24) is kind-hearted and even offered to help voluntarily, but my brother (19) and I were super annoyed.\n\nWhen I refused to give her a single buck and suggested that she should just make the celebration smaller, she flipped out, and we had a heated argument. After that, we didn't have any contact for a few days until I suddenly received a notification that a certain amount of money was missing from my bank account.\n\nIt turned out that my crazy \"stepmother\" had her hands in our accounts. Since I had a good relationship with my father, he had access to one account, which money she simply took.
