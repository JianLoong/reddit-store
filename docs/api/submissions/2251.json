The place is not too far but still is around 17-20 min drive. He started working a week ago.\n\n\nI asked him to provide me with his boss's number in case of an emergency. He refused and said that it was weird and unnecessary. I did not think he quite understood what I mean by an emergency so I brought it up with him this morning. He suddenly flipped out and told me that he won't give me his boss's number and that I should quit asking and treating him like a 4 year old. I have to say that I found this reaction horrific because I already explained to him why I need the number. My husband told me to leave it alone and that I don't need the number just because I'm being \"paranoid\". To be it wasn't about paranoia but to make sure that I can check on him if and whe he's out of reach. My husband said it makes me look controlling and intrusive.\n\n\n\nMy son came home and refused to speak to me. Didn't even eat with us and stayed in his room.", "created_utc": 1668382053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuid19/aita_for_asking_my_son_to_give_me_his_bosss_number/", "score": 4215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it\u2019s wanting him to remember to request day xyz off because he has an appointment or there\u2019s a family event taking place, a text that he\u2019ll see later is fine.

So I called and texted my sister in case she was just not answering mom that day... A few hours I get a text back, my sister had gone to sleep and forgotten to charge her phone but she had just talked to mom about an hour and a half before mom had started bugging me......
