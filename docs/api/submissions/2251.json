The place is not too far but still is around 17-20 min drive. He started working a week ago.\n\n\nI asked him to provide me with his boss's number in case of an emergency. He refused and said that it was weird and unnecessary. I did not think he quite understood what I mean by an emergency so I brought it up with him this morning. He suddenly flipped out and told me that he won't give me his boss's number and that I should quit asking and treating him like a 4 year old. I have to say that I found this reaction horrific because I already explained to him why I need the number. My husband told me to leave it alone and that I don't need the number just because I'm being \"paranoid\". To be it wasn't about paranoia but to make sure that I can check on him if and whe he's out of reach. My husband said it makes me look controlling and intrusive.\n\n\n\nMy son came home and refused to speak to me. Didn't even eat with us and stayed in his room.", "created_utc": 1668382053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuid19/aita_for_asking_my_son_to_give_me_his_bosss_number/", "score": 883, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We've got email, i have no reason to text or call.  \n\nI know it's different for non-office jobs though.", "My husbands mother was JUST LIKE THIS well into his twenties. It was absolutely embarrassing. He would yell at her begging her to stop, and she would always pull the \u201cyou\u2019re being disrespectful to me!\u201d card. \n\nShe would go on to call a car dealer he was going to visit to purchase a car he wanted (as a 25 year old) to ask the salesman some \u201cquestions\u201d. He had shared with her a link to the car he wanted.  She asked the salesman to \u201cgo easy on him\u201d and when he arrived, the salesmen were snickering at him and one asked where mommy was. \nSame thing when he went to look at apartments, and get his electricity account turned on. She also watched his bank account that was linked to hers. At 25. \n\nHe got sick of it and cut her out of his life for 7 years.\n\nYou going to go down that path, OP??", "I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to call the restaurant just to see how his day is going. The restaurant gonna block her or fire her son for the disturbance.", "Personally, I'm impressed that he managed to organise a job without letting his mother know until he had it.  I can TOTALLY see OP going with him to the interview and answering all the questions for him.  Then calling the interviewer and demanding to know why he didn't get the job.", "The amount of times I had to do this or argue with workers parents because their ADULT son or daughter was let go or on probation for being constantly late or other violations is astounding. I\u2019m still shocked by the number of calls we had to place to the emergency contacts of some younger workers when they were no call no show and no response to anyone (this was only started after a server got into a really bad accident and no one knew for like 3 hours while they were being taken to a hospital).\n9/10 their parents made up an excuse they couldn\u2019t come in suddenly\u2026\n\nWhen I first started working the only reason my parents ever had the store number (and eventually my main bosses for emergencies only) was due to cell phones not being on everyone all the time and we had actual risk of an emergency where I would be needed immediately. It was kinda just a policy of \u201cif this is a full blown family emergency your family can call the store and if no one answers call the boss to get a message to them asap\u201d. No weird texts\u2026", "I had a co-worker who was desperately upset because she hadn't heard from her daughter who was \"away at college\" in a while.  Said co-worker was considering calling the police or campus security to check on her child (who was 20 years old and a college junior).  I assumed she meant that her daughter was in another state and she hadn't been able to get in touch with her daughter in days and days, maybe a couple of weeks.  Turns out the daughter was \"away at college\" at a school an hour and a half away and hadn't spoken to mommy in two hours.  Yes, two hours.  I had labs longer than that!   Plus when I went to college my school was a 22 hour drive from home and after letting my parents know I got there I didn't call them for three weeks.  How did we become a country where our young adults can't go to work without parental supervision?  It's ludicrous.", "Right? \n\nI feel bad for OP because like I get it, baby's first job. But like calm down, take a breath.\n\nAnd if OP is worried about how she can contact her son in the event something has happened to her or her husband (if he can't have his phone on him during work hours), then she should ask the son what the chain of command is?\n\nThis might be the type of establishment to have a HR person, or an assistant/general manager that can alert the son when he's on the floor if something has happened to his folks.", "Oh absolutely.  Its the \"in case I need to check on him when he's not around\" for me. Like wtf??", "YTA . Goes from needing it 'in case of emergency' to 'so I can check on him'.", "I'm totally impressed with the son. Gets a job on his own and stands up to his mom! Awesome young man, and OP, YTA .", "There was an AITA with the exact same premise lmao. IIRC, the interviewer posted it.", "She can call the main restaurant number then.", "I kinda thought that's what she meant until the last bit that makes it sound like she's legit gonna be calling every 3 hours to see how the kid is doing.", "Don\u2019t give her any ideas", "He's 18 working his first job 17 minutes from his house and his mom wants his bosses number. \ud83d\ude10 He has never dated. She would have made sure of that.", "His gf lives with him! It\u2019s his mom.", "My MIL would call ME at work to ask where my husband, then boyfriend, was and why he was ignoring her. It was ridiculous and only got worse. We're in no contact lol. I can see this is OPs future, if she doesn't chill out and let her son live", "It happens, and it's not pretty", "Yes. \ud83d\udcaf", "I wouldn\u00b4t be 100% certain. Strict parents raise very sneaky kids who lie with the best of them. He exploded on her after the second request as she tells it--that means it was the final straw of something that\u00b4s been building for a while and I wouldn\u00b4t be remotely surprised if he\u00b4s been quietly rebelling. Maybe not full-fledged gf but what op knows may and likely does differ from reality", "He\u2019s dated. His mom thinks he works FT. He works PT & has a real life the rest of the time. When he can he will move out of state & keep his contact to a minimum. I married a guy who had a mom like this. He had my back till we had kids. But my guy wouldn\u2019t tell her no. When we had kids it got out of hand. It took years, cause I\u2019m a slow learner, but it Finally ended in divorce. \nLady, this is the road you are setting your kid on. \nYou are past co- dependent. There are tons of therapists, groups & books for you. Utilize them! Otherwise, you\u2019re gonna end up more unhappy then you already are. \nAnd a much bigger AS then you already are. \n\nFYI: your JOB as a mom, is to prepare your kids to be healthy, mature adults who are excited to LEAVE  your house & begin their own lives. Yup. It\u2019s true. It doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t welcome back (for short periods of time). It doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t miss them or visa/Versa. But that\u2019s the goal. Making/letting them do thing on their own & make mistakes is a huge part of that. Embrace it. Find yourself again. Find a hobby, your kid isn\u2019t it. Allow your kid to come to you. Or they won\u2019t come at all. No one said it was gonna be easy. They said it would be worth it.", "\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22 poor guy"]}
