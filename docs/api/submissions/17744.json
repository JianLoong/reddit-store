It is in fact extremely dangerous to put your feet on the dash while the car is in motion.

Apart from keeping it clean there's the safety aspect. If the airbag goes off it will push her knees into her skull. Google it. In one case a woman ended up with horrific injuries, including getting a good portion of her skull replaced with steel plates.", "Never mind that she's mucking up the dash, if the airbag goes off, her kneecaps will be going through the back of her head.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nStop giving her rides. \n\nAnd/or stop dating someone so disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nApparently it's really dangerous if you get in to a crash (having your feet on the dash)", "NTA\n\nShow her photos and pictures of accidents and the outcome of people with their feet on the dash. Some of them will never walk again while they might have healed up well if they sat normally. \n(Volunteer first responder speaking)", "NTA.\n\nwell well well well well, look who thinks that reasonable requests are not for her, that your property is for her use as *she* sees fit and to hell with your wants / needs / boundaries.\n\nbut convenoently forgets 'your car your rules'. so if she can't abide to them, well, she has 2 legs she can walk with.\n\nit is not only disrespectfull to your property, maybe even dirty / smelly since summer is approaching (sweating feet, walking barefoot), no, it is also really really dangerous.\n\naccidents happen in a split second, you can't predict them. \n\n[i'm sure the dummy was glad not to be alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uEt79tGgL4) as this crash test happened...", "You are NTA and secondly putting your feet on the dashboard is actually dangerous", "NTA\n\nWhat she's doing is *extremely* dangerous. On those grounds, I actually wouldn't hesitate to raise my tone slightly and demand never to do this again. Being super polite is obviously not getting you anywhere. This has nothing to do with what car do you drive in my eyes, it's simply about not giving yourself a death sentence in case of a crash.", "I'm not sure where you live, but in Scotland, it's actually illegal to put your feet up on the dash. Not only that, it's bloody dangerous. She's acting immature. My kids don't even do stuff like that.", "NTA. GF isn't doing her part.  Maybe she shouldn't be your GF.  What other reasonable requests is she going to refuse to honor?", "NTA,  firstly, basic manners. secondly, it's dangerous if there's a crash", "NTA. Your car your rules. Also not safe to have feet on the dash", "Apart from the danger to herself it's your car. We had problems getting kids to buckle up. Told them straight. No belts the car isn't moving. Only took one cancelled trip to the coast to sort that out", "NTA! If you have air bags, putting feet on the dash is EXTREMELY dangerous. In the event of an accident, the air bag will automatically deploy with enough force that her legs will be crushed into her face. People have died because of this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThe gross car accident photos where the entire ball joint of the thigh detaching is going to make it\u2019s rounds again.\n\nIt\u2019s a freaking dangerous position for the passenger.", "NTA she's disrespecting your rules and in some regions you can be fined for sitting in a such position", "NTA. Your car, your rules. And it's dangerous AF.", "NTA. It's your car and what she's doing is disrespectful. Also it's dangerous because she can end up with very serious or life threatening injuries in an accident with her legs in that position.", "NTA. Show her a few videos of what typically happens to people who has their feet up there during, even a minor, crash and she\u2019ll be keeping her feet on the ground if she has even average intelligence.", "NTA, she\u2019d be killed or paralyzed in an accident with her feet up on the dash", "Nta.

She's definitely the asshole for doing it repeatedly, but this isn't such a big deal that y'all need to reconsider the relationship, I don't think. I want to say raise your voice, but that may be extreme. I guess just tell her next time to take her feet off and don't even put them back up there. Talk to her like a child since she acts like one and maybe, if you want to be petty, put a sign up that says no feet on the dashboard. If she calls you an asshole again remind her that she does it every time and that it shouldn't be a hard rule to follow. She overstepped a pretty simple boundary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
