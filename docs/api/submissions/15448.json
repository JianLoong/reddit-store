To make it short, things didn't go well at all and i'm not talking to my sister.\n\nI ended up throwing the party. It was this like barbecue thing with friends and family\n\nI had a private talk with Kacey and my mom beforehand to ask them to please, please not say anything mean so yes, i ended up inviting both Duncan and Sakura (and baby!)\n\nFirst they said they weren't sure but ended up coming and family got to meet the baby. She goes to work with Sakura so is used to being with people, she is really well behaved and so cute! Everyone was all over them which was okay by me tbh.\n\nObviously my sister and my mom couldn't shut up. They wouldn't say anything in front of her but at first it was making fun of the baby's name (it's such a short and cute name, nothing weird or embarrassing) then about how weird it was that Duncan was doing \"girl things\" which was literally changing diapers and carrying those purses with stuff the baby needs, then it was the same mean comments about Sakura and things got real awkward when people started asking about her job and she mentioned a few photoshoots that week, Duncan wouldn't stop gushing about this big thing she was gonna do soon too, it was cute but both my mom and sister were fuming. I did try to stop them whenever i heard but i was also in my party talking with everyone.\n\nEverything went south when we were in the kitchen and my sister made a disgusting comment to my mom saying something like the baby was going to be \"pretty but stupid\" like Sakura (can't remember the exact words but basically that) and i'm sure Sakura heard.\nA few minutes later Duncan came and told me that Sakura had a stomach ache so they would leave, didn't say anything else.\n\nI didn't say anything at the moment but had a huge fight with both Kacey and mom after the party and haven't been talking to Kacey since then, i still live with my mom. It sucks because Kacey is my sister after all and i fucking miss her but that was so disgusting, i don't know what will happen. I really don't and i hate it.\n\nI did try to bring it up on a call with Duncan once but he said i don't need to say anything, they're both okay with me tho as far as i know they also didn't say anything to anyone so, yeah, that's all i guess", "created_utc": 1682185657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vdka0/update_wibta_if_i_dont_invite_my_sil_to_my/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Good for you, inviting them all.  Your mom and sister are mean girls, straight up.  Toxic and jealous. I hope you stood up for your SIL and the baby.  \n\nTime for you to move out, even if you have to get a roommate.", "I'm really glad you invited you stepbrother and Sakura and the baby. Very sorry they had to experience that incredible nastiness from family. \n\nI can see your sister gets her appalling bitchiness from your mother, be thankful you haven't taken that into your heart too. These are not women I would ever want to be like.\n\nInsecurities and jealousy are NEVER justification for being nasty to someone who's been nothing but kind and polite. \n\nI'm sorry that it means you've fallen out with sister and mum but honestly, I'm really genuinely so pleased for you that you put being a nice person before giving in to their hate-motivated demands.\n\nWishing you a bright and wonderful future.\n\nYour sister may not believe in therapy but goodness gracious does she need it desperately.", "well done young lady! you handled this in a very mature manner. you sister and mom, sorry to say are petty creatures. good luck with them and keep up the good work!\n\nhave a blessed day!", "Good on you for inviting them to the party.  Sorry that your sister and mother couldn't manage to be nice to them, and let their jealousies out.  Kacey doesn't sound like a great sister to Duncan, or SIL to Sakura.  I hope you can get some distance from Kacey, because she frankly sounds toxic.", "You acted right and I think this distance from your sister is necessary. She seems toxic, even a little bit unhinged and she needs help.", "You know, this situation is just bullying. You hear about pretty mean girls bullying the ugly/overweight/unpopular girls all the time, and the fact Sakura is better looking than them both doesn't make their behavior any different or okay.\n\nI salute you for having a spine and standing up to them! I'm sure it's not easy living with them with that atmosphere. As unpleasant it probably feels right now, I guarantee you your mom isn't doing your sister any favors by following her insecure tantrum, and your sister will have a rough future ahead of her if she doesn't control her bitterness and jealousy. Please stay strong and learn from your sister's mistakes, you're doing so great OP!!", "You would have been the AH if you didn't invite her.  You should have not invited your mom and your sister.  Awful behavior doesn't belong at a party.", "I'm moving with a friend in a few months!", "This. Right until the second last paragraph of the og post I thought op was talking about not inviting Kacey because she was causing negative drama over nothing.", "Congrats!", "Maybe Sakura can become the sister you need, cause Kayce ain't it.", "Your sister needs therapy. Yes, I know she doesn't believe in it. You know which people don't believe in therapy? The ones who are afraid of it or who don't want to put in the effort to change. Know that if ever you will find nice fitting clothes, lose a bit of weight, get a nice makeup routine or anything that will make you look better than now (and I'm sure you look great now as well), you can expect the same treatment from your sister and mother."]}
