{"id": 33429, "submission_id": "18n12g3", "title": "AITA for refusing to wrap the gifts my ex got our son?", "selftext": "I (26M) have a 6 year old son, Ollie, with my ex, Caitlyn (26F). Caitlyn has not been actively involved in the past 4 years, by her choosing. She hasn\u2019t seen Ollie in a year, I have sole custody. By court order, Caitlyn is supposed to pay child support. I have to harass her for it every month, threatening to go to court until she pays. \n\nI am doing it all on my own otherwise. The day to day care. Doctor\u2019s appointments. Dance, soccer, school. Nursing every fever, soothing every nightmare. And I truly don\u2019t mind. I love my little boy. It doesn\u2019t change that it can be exhausting and emotionally draining. I have asked Caitlyn to help more but she says she has no interest. I finally gave up.\n\nThat being said, Caitlyn expects me to facilitate all contact. She gets mad if I don\u2019t initiate the court ordered weekly FaceTime call when according to the court, she\u2019s the one who has to call. Same if I don\u2019t have my son call her, even on Ollie\u2019s birthday. She just can\u2019t be bothered. I finally stopped doing all of that because it\u2019s not my job. And half the time when I call, she doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nIf Caitlyn sends gifts for Ollie is a crap shoot. She usually doesn\u2019t even send a card. If she does send a gift, she tells-not asks-me to wrap it, put her name on it and buy a card. I did in the beginning until this past birthday. Ollie is learning how to read and asked why his mom\u2019s card looked the same as mine. I just said that I was helping his mom out. But that made me realize how much labor I was doing for Caitlyn.\n\nMy sister told me to stop all the effort. If Caitlyn sends gifts, don\u2019t wrap them. Tell Ollie they\u2019re from his mom, obviously, but no more gift tags or cards. \n\nA few weeks ago, Caitlyn told me what she was buying off the wishlist. She added she found them cheaper outside Amazon so she\u2019d be sending them herself. She told me to wrap them and get a card. I told her she could do that. She pointed out I was already wrapping gifts. I asked if she was wrapping gifts for her boyfriend, family, etc. She said yes but I could do this for her. I told her no, put some effort in and just wrap them as well as write a card herself or at least just put a gift tag. But if she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll just give them to Ollie as is on Christmas morning and say they\u2019re from mommy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll care that they\u2019re unwrapped. He\u2019ll be happy just to get what he wanted.\n\nWell, Caitlyn called my bluff and sent them unwrapped. I put them in the closet and plan to put them out as is on Christmas morning. Caitlyn texted me a reminder to wrap them and I said \u201cI already told you what I was doing. I\u2019m done doing all the work for you. If you wanted to put in the effort, you could.\u201d I added that as she lives 45 minutes away, if she wanted, she could come down and wrap them herself. Maybe even give them to Ollie herself. She said I was being a jackass and hung up. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder if I should just wrap them. But I also am just so tired of taking up for her.

First, I would like to say that you are doing your best to be an awesome parent and dad!  Also remember that your son is 6.  The people giving advice are not the people who have to see the disappointment on your son\u2019s face.  What I would do and have done is start keeping a journal and then let your lawyer know that you have to facilitate all communication and that despite having court orders in place, your ex doesn\u2019t meet her end of the bargain.

I would wrap up the presents-not because you are doing her a favour but because it will make your son happy.  Ultimately it\u2019s his happiness that matters and I absolutely understand that it chaps your ass to do this but if you think that you aren\u2019t doing it for her but rather you are doing it for Ollie, then it puts a different perspective on things.
