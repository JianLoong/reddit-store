{"id": 33429, "submission_id": "18n12g3", "title": "AITA for refusing to wrap the gifts my ex got our son?", "selftext": "I (26M) have a 6 year old son, Ollie, with my ex, Caitlyn (26F). Caitlyn has not been actively involved in the past 4 years, by her choosing. She hasn\u2019t seen Ollie in a year, I have sole custody. By court order, Caitlyn is supposed to pay child support. I have to harass her for it every month, threatening to go to court until she pays. \n\nI am doing it all on my own otherwise. The day to day care. Doctor\u2019s appointments. Dance, soccer, school. Nursing every fever, soothing every nightmare. And I truly don\u2019t mind. I love my little boy. It doesn\u2019t change that it can be exhausting and emotionally draining. I have asked Caitlyn to help more but she says she has no interest. I finally gave up.\n\nThat being said, Caitlyn expects me to facilitate all contact. She gets mad if I don\u2019t initiate the court ordered weekly FaceTime call when according to the court, she\u2019s the one who has to call. Same if I don\u2019t have my son call her, even on Ollie\u2019s birthday. She just can\u2019t be bothered. I finally stopped doing all of that because it\u2019s not my job. And half the time when I call, she doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nIf Caitlyn sends gifts for Ollie is a crap shoot. She usually doesn\u2019t even send a card. If she does send a gift, she tells-not asks-me to wrap it, put her name on it and buy a card. I did in the beginning until this past birthday. Ollie is learning how to read and asked why his mom\u2019s card looked the same as mine. I just said that I was helping his mom out. But that made me realize how much labor I was doing for Caitlyn.\n\nMy sister told me to stop all the effort. If Caitlyn sends gifts, don\u2019t wrap them. Tell Ollie they\u2019re from his mom, obviously, but no more gift tags or cards. \n\nA few weeks ago, Caitlyn told me what she was buying off the wishlist. She added she found them cheaper outside Amazon so she\u2019d be sending them herself. She told me to wrap them and get a card. I told her she could do that. She pointed out I was already wrapping gifts. I asked if she was wrapping gifts for her boyfriend, family, etc. She said yes but I could do this for her. I told her no, put some effort in and just wrap them as well as write a card herself or at least just put a gift tag. But if she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll just give them to Ollie as is on Christmas morning and say they\u2019re from mommy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll care that they\u2019re unwrapped. He\u2019ll be happy just to get what he wanted.\n\nWell, Caitlyn called my bluff and sent them unwrapped. I put them in the closet and plan to put them out as is on Christmas morning. Caitlyn texted me a reminder to wrap them and I said \u201cI already told you what I was doing. I\u2019m done doing all the work for you. If you wanted to put in the effort, you could.\u201d I added that as she lives 45 minutes away, if she wanted, she could come down and wrap them herself. Maybe even give them to Ollie herself. She said I was being a jackass and hung up. \n\nI\u2019m starting to wonder if I should just wrap them. But I also am just so tired of taking up for her.

Regardless of what you do at some point your son will understand who is mother is and that she only has limited affection for him. Nothing anyone does will change that realisation. I'm going to share a story about a client I had at the beginning of my career and running into his son, who I now work with, as an adult. My client was a single dad whose ex wife was an academic who didn't want her career held back by their child so she up and decided to move countries with barely any notice. She called infrequently, sent gifts late if at all, constantly broke promises .... She was a deadbeat yet their child though she loved him like no parent could ever love a child. This was because the father was buying gifts, making the phone calls, personally paying for the plane tickets etc. I use to watch this and think 'why? She doesn't deserve her son to have a good opinion of her'. Now much later the child decided himself to study law and while studying works as an assistant at a firm I work with frequently. He turned into a lovely young man and a real credit to his dad. Now here is the thing, he now knows his mother is a deadbeat and loves his dad all the more because rather then placing the consequences of the parent being the deadbeat on the child, his father instead did everything possible to mitigate the effect and instead of raising a child with abandonment issues who felt unloved or unlovable he has this fantastic young man who anyone would be proud.\n\nYou get my point. For our children's sake, not our exs, we mitigate the harm their neglect will cause. We do this because we love our children more than we want to feel vindicated or validated about our exs behaviour. Kids will eventually figure it out, they are pretty smart, and when they do they will appreciate the extra effort you went to all the more.\n\nNow this isn't a requirement.

Everything has to be on her terms in her way, and no she's not ever taking responsibility when her lack of action affects things because she pretty much expects anyone and everyone she has mentioned something to to read the unsaid \"Now that I've told you about this it's now /your obligation/ to make sure it gets done even though it isn't legally or morally so at all but I expect you to and failure to do so means you're lazy, worthless and toxic because you /should/ be doing everything for me because I said so.\"\n\nYou're exactly right in that if she wanted to she has ample opportunity. She called your bluff, too bad for her you're not bluffing.\n\nThink about it this way, all the time, energy and money you don't waste picking up her slack is time, energy and money you can spend on you and your son.\n\nCourt has ruled your ex has to do her part, so she has no legal grounds to be pissy if you don't do her part for her.", "NTA. Can\u2019t wait to see what condition these gifts are in given they were cheaper than Amazon.", "NTA. Stick to your word, it\u2019s your best option. She\u2019s been walking all over you for years.

Filling in on an occassional miss is one thing, this is her not even putting in the minimum effort and trying to make it your fault.", "If I could wrap these gifts for you I would OP. You\u2019re doing a good job with your kid.", "This is very good advice. Kids are smart, and kids are resiliant.  Mine are grown now, but I have been in this situation. I think there are two extremes in these situations... trying to cover for the almost absent parent and bad-mouthing. I recommend letting the truth be there and the kids realize the truth in their own time. My kids got to the point of \" If dad doesn't show up, can we do...\" \n\nOP, you are doing a great job.

It almost seems more belligerent to do that and not wrap it or be there to give it than to not have gotten it at all.\n\nAgain, I feel like you\u2019re being beyond reasonable and NTA, I just wonder if there is a compromise that would help offset any hurt Ollie could have from this later?
