We\u2019ve had this babysitter for over 3 years now and back when we lived in an apartment, things were great. She was never late and she lived in the same building so there wasn\u2019t much concern about her walking back to her apartment.\n\nLast year we moved into a house and she suddenly started showing up late. She always complained that there was no street parking available and that half the time she ended up at a public parking lot around 7 or 8 blocks away. Once she told us where she was parking, my husband would walk her to her car but it was late and the weather was never good for that kind of walk so on the days where she\u2019s working, I park on the street in front of our house, which opens up a driveway spot for her.\n\nThe problem is our neighbor, who usually parks in front of my house, is out of a parking spot those days and has come to complain to me about me parking on the street when I have a driveway spot available. I said street parking is first come first serve and we need that spot in the driveway for someone else but he still thinks I\u2019m being selfish. My husband says he can see both sides and that we should probably try to find another solution to the parking problem but I don\u2019t think we should have to move our cars so he can park in front of our house and I don\u2019t feel comfortable having my very petite 18 year old babysitter walking 8 blocks to her car at night.\n\nAITA for saving a parking spot for the babysitter\n\n<QUOTE>", "It\u2019s a PUBLIC street.
