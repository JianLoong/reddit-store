If you have a guest coming or a delivery that needs to be made in your driveway, you can park on the street. The neighbor doesn't own the space anymore than you do. If they have too many cars for their own garage/driveway, then that's a THEM problem, not a YOU problem. And once a week, they can scuttle about to find an alternative space.\n\nYour husband is being overly considerate of the neighbor's demands when clearly the neighbor holds no such consideration of your needs. If you were doing this every day, he might have a point. But you're doing it once a week. The neighbor is being a bully.", "NTA\u2026.thank you for being so kind and caring about her well-being.\n\nThe street is public parking and first come first serve.

I hate everyone who believes the street in front of their house is \"their\" spot.", "NTA \n\nI might get down voted here.  I've lived in a handful of cities where parking can be tight. Street parking is a public resource.  You, as part of the public, can use it.", "Info: why does the neighbor need the spot in front of your house? Does the neighbor have parking as well?", "NTA\n\nStreet parking is first come, first serve and what you're doing is perfectly acceptable. No one is entitled to a particular spot. A car parks, a car leaves, a different car parks. That's how it's supposed to work. \n\nIf you were using cones or whatever instead of actually parking a car, I would say you were completely in the wrong, but that's not what is happening. Your neighbor just feels entitled to a space that everyone has a right to use.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would be pissed if I was the neighbor for the same reasons and because of the inconvenience, bit I would also accept that I just don't have any special claim to the parking spot.", "NTA - he has a driveway with 3 cars. So he needs to park in the street. He can do the same thing with his wife or son and have them park in the street if they get home sooner.", "NTA - it really should be first come first served to be fair.", "NTA.  As you correctly state, street parking is first come.", "NTA. First come first serve is simple. If neighbor wants a designated space they should pay for one.", "Does you neighbour not have a driveway?", "NTA. No one owns the street parking. You can park there if you like. What you're doing is thoughtful & much safer for her. The men in the story have no clue the danger she might be in; they are just thinking about what's easiest.\n\nTell them you're open to other solutions, but until they come up with one that keeps her from having to walk alone at night that you agree with, you're sticking with this solution.", "NTA, street parking is first come; first serve. If he can\u2019t fit all his family\u2019s vehicles in his driveway; that\u2019s his problem. Maybe he or one of his kids can park 8 blocks away.", "NTA - First come first serve.

It might be nice to at least try to find another solution, but not because you're doing anything wrong.", "NTA it\u2019s a public street.", "NTA! NTA NTA NTA!    \n\n\nStreet parking is STREET parking.  it's open.  First come, first served.  \n\n\nIf anything, call ahead when you know your babysitter is coming, let your neighbor know ahead of time that she will need to plan accordingly.  But no, do your thing and keep your babysitter safe.", "NTA.  Typically \"saving\" street parking spots is an AH move but that isn't what you're doing.  You're putting your car on the street and reserving your driveway for the sitter.  Seems OK to me.", "NTA - Street parking is first-come-first-serve, period.  You have just as much right to it as anyone else, regardless of the availability of your driveway.\n\nNo dibs on public parking.", "NTA. You're just as entitled to park on the street. It's a safety issue for your babysitter to park further away.", "NTA\n\nYou're right, street parking is first come first served. Your neighbor is not entitled to the spot in front of your house.", "NTA You have just as much right to use street parking as your neighbor. It maybe wouldn\u2019t be nice if you did it for no reason all, but you have a good reason.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, if anyone gets to park in front of it, it's you.", "NTA. Street parking is first come first served and if you neighbor doesn\u2019t have a driveway they should know to get there and park when they can because it might be taken. Also you\u2019re looking out for your babysitter which is an important thing to do", "NTA, that's how street parking works.  Only in like, Chicago winters are you allowed to save a spot after you shoveled yourself out.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy can't you guys just go get her and take her home, though?  That way neither of you have to worry about parking. Just, you know, somebody's gotta worry about driving her back and forth.  Thing is, she's 18 - if she goes to college, she might be gone or too busy to sit for you before you know it.  I know that might be a short term solution, but....but for a great, really TRUSTED babysitter?  That's worth gold to me, I'd happily drive her half an hour to and fro to know with complete certainty that the sitter I've been with for three years stayed with me for another three while she studies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it was some situation where he didn't have parking and it was massively inconveniencing him then I'd think you and the babysitter would be better to just deal with it by having her come earlier or drive her to the public lot, but if he's complaining about not having somewhere to park his household's *fourth* car once a week, he's an asshole.", "It\u2019s great in theory but not likely to work in practice.
