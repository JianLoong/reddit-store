Jess asked me if I could give her advice on it, and I gave her this advice:  \n\n\\- Sometimes people will try to \"debate\" you on your sexuality, I'd never engage. Even if you \"win\", debating your personhood will eat you up inside.   \n\n\\- Instead, know this about biggots. Their hate isn't about you. When someone shames another person, they are often coming from a place of deep internal shame, self-restriction, isolation, etc. They see self-denial as a virtue, to justify their own self-imposed restriction, and resent the person who's in true accord with themselves.   \n\n\\- They're deeply lonely, in a fearful place, having been indoctrinated to fear their fellow man. They're part of churches or organizations that maintain power and control through fear of the other - and you are unfortunately being \"othered\" as a propaganda tool.  \n\n\\- If someone tries to argue with you about your sexuality, ask them to reflect on themselves instead. Don't let them \"debate\" you - just keep reminding them that they only have to answer to themselves and to God.   \n\nI gave her all that advice and she listened, and felt better hearing that the shit people are saying about her is 100% not about her. But stuff got kinda rough when she went back to church next.   \n\nApparently one of her dad's friends was giving her the whole 'love the sinner hate the sin\" shit and she went off on him - asking him in front of everyone why he was getting so red in the face? Saying that she didn't want to debate her own sexuality. But she was concerned about him - that he was so clearly sad and afraid and ashamed that he was putting that pain out into the world. And she hoped he'd go home that day and reflect on whether he wanted to go through life letting fear and shame control and isolate him.   \n\nIt apparently made things really awkward, and made the guy madder. He got at her saying she didn't know him, and she was like \"I don't have to know you to see that... I'll pray for you...'   \n\nWhich damn - gen z is gutsy and honestly I was proud of her. But my sister was upset, she asked me if I'd told her daughter to call this guy sad and angry, and I said yeah, though just generally - not about that specific guy.  \n\nMy sister told me she thought I was setting her daughter up for trouble, that the stuff I suggested she say was gonna make a lot of people angry. I said those people were already angry.  \n\nShe said that advice wasn't age appropriate at all, and that I should have said more of the \"love yourself / self confidence\" stuff she wanted her daughter to be safee and worried about her saying that kinda thing.  \n\nAITA for the advice I gave?

She\u2019s not gonna have an easy go of it, speaking out like that every time someone approaches her like that, as in my experience, it just makes them madder and more insecure in themselves, but it\u2019s empowering for her, being able to stand up for herself like that. You\u2019re teaching her strength and self-respect and that\u2019s amazing. She clearly came to you because she trusts you as someone in her life who has been through it already.

They live in a small town that's pretty rough for that. People are very judgy and in each other's business, and unfortunate as it is, one person in a family being gay, especially the \"wrong type\" of gay (i.e. open about it instead of behind closed doors) can make a whole family outcasts socially", "She already does! She's lucky enough to have wonderful friends and family who have been there for her enough that she's never doubted herself.\n\nShe's just been struggling with how to deal with random people whose opinions she doesn't even want coming round and trying to 'debate' her when she doesn't want her humanity up for debate. So that's why my advice focused more on telling her that their BS is absolutely not about her, it's either their own emptiness, or their own indoctrination into hate, and that she should never lower herself to their level.. just point out that they're in a bad place to even be asking those questions. \n\nI honestly feel like the guys who are like \"I'm jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs / cAnT wE hAvE a dEbAtE???\" About some kid's humanity are the ones really trying to pick a fight.

Coming from a queer person who is not a shrinking violet at all, I\u2019m on your side but I can see your sister\u2019s point. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, LGBTQ+ life has specific risks that straight people rarely see. We accept those risks because it\u2019s worth it to live, laugh, love, roast bigots at church, etc. We\u2019ll walk past armed protesters to go to a drag show. We\u2019ll present ourselves how we want and shake off the side eye because it matters to be ourselves. \n\nYour sister\u2026 doesn\u2019t see or live with ANY of this on a regular basis. Her kid is going to have a different life than her and places that are friendly and safe for her will be hostile and potentially dangerous for her child. She just got an eyeful and earful of what it means to be a queer kid with a voice and a spine, at her own church, and it was not pretty. And your sister sounds like she might not be good at conflict and dealing with risks, like at all. She doesn\u2019t have your tried and true strategies because she hasn\u2019t lived that life.\n\nI would reinforce with her that her child was *already* in an unsafe situation before this guy started popping off. And that her daughter most likely *knew that* before a single word was spoken, has known that for years. Part of being a parent of a teenager is learning to trust your child\u2019s risk assessments, that\u2019s what parents are doing every time they take a step back from managing their kids\u2019 homework, hand their kids the car keys, fill out a FAFSA form. \n\nYour sister needs to learn to trust her daughter to handle situations. And not pull back that trust if something goes sideways. Your niece deserves to be the decision maker of her own life, around her queerness and around other things too. \n\nHowever, you may just want to follow up on your niece\u2019s risk assessment abilities and willingness to engage in conflict for good reasons, by taking her to a queer-friendly basic self-defense course that includes strategies for de-escalation and disengagement. Your sis should come too and learn more about how to be an active bystander.", "Yep, and they will never accept  her. It's hard debating people who have no real intentions of hearing you out.", "But she clearly heard it as \u201cwhen people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d rather than just telling them she wasn\u2019t going to debate her existence. All that was going to do was egg him on, as satisfying as saying could have been.", "I don't think the response is a wrong one at all. That's why i said NAH. I just think that if I were a mother, I could understand wanting my child to not go back and forth with those types of ppl because the worst of them can react in some horrible ways.", "Amen! \n\nSeriously though sister needs to find an LGBTQ+ friendly church. They are out there.", "> All that was going to do was egg him on\n\nHonestly I've seen it have the opposite effect\n \nI've used that trick for 15 years and honestly have never had someone come back for seconds after being told they seem deeply sad and that I was worried for them, since carrying that kind of anger can burn a person up inside.\n\n> \"when people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d\n\nAlso no offense but as a queer girl in a deeply conservative religious area... That's an essential life skill if you want to keep any amount of dignity and self confidence. \n\nI've tried shrinking myself down to hide, and not to get to personal but it almost cost me my life. I'm not kidding when I say that's a survival skill - especially in terms of managing mental health", "\"Those types of people\" are their family friends, though. I say the parents are AHs for associating with \"those types of people\" in the first place.", "Yeah fair.

Tell them they seem sad and angry and say you don't want to talk, you just hope they think about what you just said, keeping it between themselves and God?

It's a rough place for queer people", "Idk my life experiences disagree. \n\nI'm curious why you say that? Like what does caution look like for you? And is there any way to be \"cautious\" in these situations without causing oneself trauma? \n\nSeriously curious because I haven't personally found any way to do that", "Different people have different experiences. To me, caution is to tell her to stand her ground but not engage. Clearly that guy took what she was saying as bait, and that\u2019s why their argument went on as long as it did. Homophobes and the like are feeling much bolder these days.", "NTA, and Jesus your niece sounds bloody awesome. Good for you both!", "NTA but I do think I understand the mom\u2019s concerns. I think she\u2019s just afraid her daughter will (rightfully) call out people the way OP taught, and that will cause someone (most likely a man in her mind) to physically react and take it out on her daughter. Which is a very real possibility and genuine fear to have. But the solution isn\u2019t to stop the niece from her actions. The solution is to make sure she\u2019s prepared to physically defend from others actions, if the worst were to happen. The fact is the way she\u2019s calling them is not wrong but it is a harsh reality and people can\u2019t handle being told harsh truths.", "NTA.  You gave her great advice, and she sounds like a great kid.\n\nGiven this is a friend of her husbands, I think your sister has some pretty serious self-reflection to do.  She shouldn't have been exposed to this kind of hateful rhetoric in the first place, and the fact that they blamed their *child* for... what, hurting his feelings? Instead of him for being shitty or themselves for allowing a bigot access to their child in the first place is pretty garbage.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should be more concerned about someone being homophobic toward her child than how said child reacts to it.", "NTA. You were real with your niece. She went to you for help for a reason. You did good by her!!", "NTA. You rock.\n\nYour sister should be supporting her child, not fretting about what bigots think.", "NTA, although teens may not have the best risk assessment and put themselves in danger sometimes. I know I did, I pick my battles more wisely now. But sounds like that was an unsafe situation before she ever responded, redirect your sister at that man & her church.\n\nSome solid advice my dad gave me was a similar redirect but more pointed: \"Why do you think it is at all appropriate to talk about this to me? It's very strange that you feel entitled to force your opinion into a space it doesn't belong. I don't make decisions about my life based on strangers' comfort so leave me alone.\" \n\nOr simpler \"Yeah I'm uninterested in talking to you/being around you at all, leave me alone.\"", "NTA! That's an incredible age-appropriate way to explain it! Makes it clear it's all on the bigots, she's not responsible, but doing it in a way that gives her a way to respond with generosity and humanity. It's so hard not to get angry and discouraged, and this gives her the tools too keep herself and her perspective healthier in the face of all the bs in the world.

Sounds like your sister would rather her daughter 'turn the other cheek' to save her some embarrassment.  Not gay here, and I'll admit when I was younger I was a real asshole.  But I learned over many years how to keep an open mind.  I've come to the conclusion that a person's orientation or life choices don't make them any less human than I am.  So I treat everyone I meet the same, like I would want to be treated.  I have several friends of both genders (Haven't met anyone who identifies as anything else) and a few of them are out of the closet, so if I don't understand something I can ask.  They're comfortable enough talking to me about it.  \n\nPeople have the right to be who they are and who they want to be.  I'm not really religious anymore because I have found a lot of hypocrisy in organized religion.  I believe in God, and I believe that he gave mankind the greatest gift in the universe.  Free Will.  So unless he comes down here and tells us mortals that loving someone is wrong, then I'll go on believing things my own way.  \n\nAnyway, that's just me.

Your sister\u2019s approach failed to advise your daughter on how to defend herself.  Shame on her parents for allowing an adult to lecture/yell at their daughter until he\u2019s red in the face.  The parents should have shut him down.  How did the bigot even know your niece is lesbian?  Did her parents tell him?  Did they set her up for the verbal attack?  Why didn\u2019t they shut him down?  Is this really about her safety, or their discomfort about her sexuality?", "NTA.\n\nThe advice you gave is spot on for basically all of the reasons people get othered - whether it's sexual orientation or gender or race or disability or (fill in the blank). You gave your niece tools to help her understand the most important thing - she is not at fault for the hate she will receive from some people - by helping her to see the truth of where bigoted behaviour comes from.\n\nThe fact that your niece used this information in this way was her decision. It shows she's brave and amazing, but it wasn't actually your advice that she confront people with their own fears & insecurities. She chose that course on her own (what a rockstar).\n\nI think your sister is simply afraid for her daughter's safety and maybe lashing out a bit? Perhaps she needs a nudge to see that the person giving her daughter support to be comfortable in her own skin is not the problem. It's the person trying to intimidate her daughter into feeling wrong and unworthy. He's the problem, and he has some nerve trying to impose his hangups on another person, especially one so much younger than himself. He's angry because he was confronted with the truth when what he expected was a meek little girl who would be too intimidated to talk back to him so he could feel better about himself.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said to your niece is so true.

That\u2019s the worst thing about people like him. They claim to hate \u201csin\u201d and use that as a way to commit crimes. There is no winning against people like him. Your sister needs to realize that as the sister and mother of people that are homosexual. She may think she understands, but she obviously does not. She needs to target that energy towards the dad. A person should be able to go to church and not feel attacked by someone.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, your niece is old enough to know what's appropriate. She was triggered by people's judgment of her *and* your words. But just because you're triggered doesn't mean you have to act. Secondly, she was behaving normally for someone in an impossible situation. When everyone around you acts crazy, it's normal and healthy to react as she did. As you probably know, there is very likely a genetic link to homosexuality. But people say they'll \"pray for you,\" as if you chose the worst sin ever. Thirdly, your sister isn't trying to \"protect\" her delicate, shy, timid little daughter (har). She's probably just embarrassed. Fourthly, your sister doesn't get to tell you how to phrase things. You've spent the last 35 years forming your own opinion. You know what it is.", "NTA! But, I do see your sister\u2019s perspective. A lot of parents try to find a path for their kids where they don\u2019t have to fight the world. Your sister is probably concerned with how hard your niece\u2019s life will be.

Omg you are NOT the AH.", "This one is tough for me. I\u2019m also queer. On one hand, your advice is spot on for her mental health. On the other hand, I sympathize with your sister for fearing for the physical safety of her daughter. The anti-lgbtq hate just in the past 18 months has completely caught me off guard, and it seems like it\u2019s getting worse by the minute. This is definitely the worst it\u2019s felt for me in the 17 years since I came out though granted it\u2019s the anti trans stuff that\u2019s most scary right now, but it\u2019s not just that. See the \u201ckill all gays\u201d road sign in Florida for example. So with this surge of hate and attention there are definitely things I would have felt safe doing or saying in the past that I\u2019m reevaluating given the current climate.

Your advice was effective and beautifully accomplished the goal of demonstrating to your niece that bigots' views come from a place of deep insecurity.\n\nAlso, if your sister was worried that her daughter wasn't safe while in a group of her dad's friends, it sounds like she is projecting her anxieties onto you instead of taking them up with the person who was in a position to step in and shut things down in the first place, the girl's father. He needs to step up and show who is more important to him, his bigoted friends or his own daughter.", "NTA. If she didn't want you to give your daughter advice, she shouldn't have asked.

I mean, it\u2019s just the truth but that\u2019s not how I would personally handle closed-minded people. Your niece is very young and is just learning about the world around her. What she doesn\u2019t know is that while many times people m act out as a reflection of their own internal conflict and unhappiness, pointing that out to them will only make them angrier which is what she witnessed.  What I would have told her is to keep that in mind and not let people make you feel bad but at the same time, don\u2019t be confrontational and don\u2019t try to change the world because many people can\u2019t change. I would tell her to surround herself with good, kind people. If that church has outed her as gay and someone to be \u201cfixed,\u201d your sister needs to move to a different church asap! And your niece needs to learn to deflect not confront. That guy was being a jerk and I got a chuckle out of how she got to him but it honestly didn\u2019t benefit her in the long run. What if she did that to a professor or a boss who is holding some of her life in his or her hands? Being right isn\u2019t everything. I\u2019ve had to learn that the hard way. You have to look at the big picture and do what gets you ahead. Fixing someone or trying to make someone a better person will not really serve her in any way. As hard as that may be to accept. The hardest part for her will be to internalize that she is a a worthy, valuable human-being just as she is and to not let bad people get to her all the while not butting heads with said people. That was hard for me; biting my tongue. I learned after lots of suffering. And after all that suffering, I also learned to not stay in oppressive situations. Just go where you are supported and valued and don\u2019t have to defend yourself or fight back. That gets really tiring after a while.", "NTA. You gave your niece great advice.
