Jess asked me if I could give her advice on it, and I gave her this advice:  \n\n\\- Sometimes people will try to \"debate\" you on your sexuality, I'd never engage. Even if you \"win\", debating your personhood will eat you up inside.   \n\n\\- Instead, know this about biggots. Their hate isn't about you. When someone shames another person, they are often coming from a place of deep internal shame, self-restriction, isolation, etc. They see self-denial as a virtue, to justify their own self-imposed restriction, and resent the person who's in true accord with themselves.   \n\n\\- They're deeply lonely, in a fearful place, having been indoctrinated to fear their fellow man. They're part of churches or organizations that maintain power and control through fear of the other - and you are unfortunately being \"othered\" as a propaganda tool.  \n\n\\- If someone tries to argue with you about your sexuality, ask them to reflect on themselves instead. Don't let them \"debate\" you - just keep reminding them that they only have to answer to themselves and to God.   \n\nI gave her all that advice and she listened, and felt better hearing that the shit people are saying about her is 100% not about her. But stuff got kinda rough when she went back to church next.   \n\nApparently one of her dad's friends was giving her the whole 'love the sinner hate the sin\" shit and she went off on him - asking him in front of everyone why he was getting so red in the face? Saying that she didn't want to debate her own sexuality. But she was concerned about him - that he was so clearly sad and afraid and ashamed that he was putting that pain out into the world. And she hoped he'd go home that day and reflect on whether he wanted to go through life letting fear and shame control and isolate him.   \n\nIt apparently made things really awkward, and made the guy madder. He got at her saying she didn't know him, and she was like \"I don't have to know you to see that... I'll pray for you...'   \n\nWhich damn - gen z is gutsy and honestly I was proud of her. But my sister was upset, she asked me if I'd told her daughter to call this guy sad and angry, and I said yeah, though just generally - not about that specific guy.  \n\nMy sister told me she thought I was setting her daughter up for trouble, that the stuff I suggested she say was gonna make a lot of people angry. I said those people were already angry.  \n\nShe said that advice wasn't age appropriate at all, and that I should have said more of the \"love yourself / self confidence\" stuff she wanted her daughter to be safee and worried about her saying that kinda thing.  \n\nAITA for the advice I gave? It was honestly the best advice I had, but I can see where my sister is coming from saying it's not the best advice for a teenager\n\nEdited to add line breaks", "created_utc": 1684706992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o7y4i/aita_for_how_i_suggested_my_niece_deal_with/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Self love is amazing obviously- but it can be hard to love yourself when everyone at church calls you a sinner.\n\nYour niece handled it Amazingly and it's disappointing her parents didn't support her and aren't proud of her.

I\u2019d be proud of her too, she needs that gutsy attitude to face the world.", "NTA-that was the best advice and it sounds like your niece handled business. Her mom just doesn't like confrontation and should've stepped up so her daughter wouldn't have to be in that situation.\n\nShe asked you to talk to her, you did, and gave her the self confidence to stand up for herself.

A person who is bigoted and open enough to go at it with a teenager might not be the most stable. Those heated conversations she's having could lead to a person like that becoming violent or worse.

These people need to either be able to explain their thought process or reflect on themselves and they\u2019re obviously not gonna do that unless they\u2019re called out. Well done to your niece. She\u2019s not gonna have an easy go of it, speaking out like that every time someone approaches her like that, as in my experience, it just makes them madder and more insecure in themselves, but it\u2019s empowering for her, being able to stand up for herself like that. You\u2019re teaching her strength and self-respect and that\u2019s amazing. She clearly came to you because she trusts you as someone in her life who has been through it already.

Like I'm genuinely impressed because I have too much anger to take the high road when people behave homophobically towards me.\n\nI think your sister needs to understand that her lesbian daughter is going to face trouble no matter what, especially in a church environment. And you are doing her a favour in preparing her for it and teaching her how to shut it down without giving the homophobes inch, instead of the flowery self esteem stuff.

He gets to call her out for her \u201csins\u201d but she can\u2019t counter that?  She stood up for herself and should feel fantastic for it. But your sister and BIL need to get on that bandwagon too. And adopt the same philosophy when others try to object to their daughters sexuality. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  You gave your niece excellent advice on a very mature topic.  You provided ideas and insight that she needs to go forth and use against bigots every day.  \n\nIf you were to give her \"dumbed down\" advice for a younger person (she's not that young IMO) then she would be inadequately equipped to deal with the type of adversity she faces in day-to-day life.  \n\nI think you are a terrific role model for your niece.\n\n'", "NTA - gaining confidence and loving yourself is great advice and all, but that doesn't cut the mustard when facing bigotry.

It took lots of life experience to realize it simply Was Not About Me\n\nI feel shitty my niece is in a rough situation in her hometown but honestly I feel like she's got what I wished I had at that age, the conviction that someone else's hate is not her problem and honestly it's just kinda sad of them.", "Yeah... They live in a small town that's pretty rough for that. People are very judgy and in each other's business, and unfortunate as it is, one person in a family being gay, especially the \"wrong type\" of gay (i.e. open about it instead of behind closed doors) can make a whole family outcasts socially", "She already does! She's lucky enough to have wonderful friends and family who have been there for her enough that she's never doubted herself.\n\nShe's just been struggling with how to deal with random people whose opinions she doesn't even want coming round and trying to 'debate' her when she doesn't want her humanity up for debate. So that's why my advice focused more on telling her that their BS is absolutely not about her, it's either their own emptiness, or their own indoctrination into hate, and that she should never lower herself to their level.. just point out that they're in a bad place to even be asking those questions. \n\nI honestly feel like the guys who are like \"I'm jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs / cAnT wE hAvE a dEbAtE???\" About some kid's humanity are the ones really trying to pick a fight. My advice was to not stoop to their level and give their attempt any attention", "Genuine question - how else would you respond? \n\nI've been dealing with this stuff for most of my life, and I've honestly never found anything more effective at shutting stuff down permanently than refusing to engage and playing the \"go home and take a long hard look in the mirror' card when people push it.", "I mean, wasn't she *already* in a dangerous situation with this man who felt entitled to approach a *teenager* and force her into an unwanted discussion with him about her sexuality? And this man is their family \"friend\"? \n\nSounds like your sister is focused on the wrong person here (you), and needs to seriously reevaluate who she associates with.", ">advice that she felt might put her in a dangerous situation\n\nYeah no, if she's so concerned about her daughter's safety she wouldn't be taking her to a church like that in the first place. Personally I wouldn't set foot near any church since it's always an unnecessary risk but there are a few accepting ones here and there if the kid wants to remain Christian after this ordeal \n\nNTA", "Oof this is rough. Coming from a queer person who is not a shrinking violet at all, I\u2019m on your side but I can see your sister\u2019s point. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, LGBTQ+ life has specific risks that straight people rarely see. We accept those risks because it\u2019s worth it to live, laugh, love, roast bigots at church, etc. We\u2019ll walk past armed protesters to go to a drag show. We\u2019ll present ourselves how we want and shake off the side eye because it matters to be ourselves. \n\nYour sister\u2026 doesn\u2019t see or live with ANY of this on a regular basis. Her kid is going to have a different life than her and places that are friendly and safe for her will be hostile and potentially dangerous for her child. She just got an eyeful and earful of what it means to be a queer kid with a voice, at her own church, and it was not pretty. And your sister sounds like she might not be good at conflict and dealing with risks, like at all. She doesn\u2019t have your tried and true strategies because she hasn\u2019t lived that life.\n\nI would reinforce with her that her child was *already* in an unsafe situation before this guy started popping off. And that her daughter most likely *knew that* before a single word was spoken, has known that for years. Part of being a parent of a teenager is learning to trust your child\u2019s risk assessments, that\u2019s what parents are doing every time they take a step back from managing their kids\u2019 homework, hand their kids the car keys, fill out a FAFSA form. \n\nYour sister needs to learn to trust her daughter to handle situations. And not pull back that trust if something goes sideways. Your niece deserves to be the decision maker of her own life, around her queerness and around other things too. \n\nHowever, you may just want to follow up on your niece\u2019s risk assessment abilities and willingness to engage in conflict for good reasons, by taking her to a queer-friendly basic self-defense course that includes strategies for de-escalation and disengagement. Your sis should come too and learn more about how to be an active bystander.", "Yep, and they will never accept  her. It's hard debating people who have no real intentions of hearing you out.", "But she clearly heard it as \u201cwhen people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d rather than just telling them she wasn\u2019t going to debate her existence. All that was going to do was egg him on, as satisfying as saying could have been.", "I don't think the response is a wrong one at all. That's why i said NAH. I just think that if I were a mother, I could understand wanting my child to not go back and forth with those types of ppl because the worst of them can react in some horrible ways.", "Amen! \n\nSeriously though sister needs to find an LGBTQ+ friendly church. They are out there.", "> All that was going to do was egg him on\n\nHonestly I've seen it have the opposite effect\n \nI've used that trick for 15 years and honestly have never had someone come back for seconds after being told they seem deeply sad and that I was worried for them, since carrying that kind of anger can burn a person up inside.\n\n> \"when people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d\n\nAlso no offense but as a queer girl in a deeply conservative religious area... That's an essential life skill if you want to keep any amount of dignity and self confidence. \n\nI've tried shrinking myself down to hide, and not to get to personal but it almost cost me my life. I'm not kidding when I say that's a survival skill - especially in terms of managing mental health", "\"Those types of people\" are their family friends, though. I say the parents are AHs for associating with \"those types of people\" in the first place.", "Yeah fair. The trouble is that they get like a dog with a bone - they usually won't quit unless you say or do something to shut them down. And between the available options... \n\n1. Debate your own personhood (bad idea, emotionally fraught, draining, traumatic)\n\n2. Tell them they seem sad and angry and say you don't want to talk, you just hope they think about what you just said, keeping it between themselves and God? (Better, gets you out of the situation, maybe might actually get someone to reflect on themselves? Or at least feel embarrassed to have just come off as a sad pitiful type)\n\nI feel like 2 works a lot better for protecting your own peace.", "That\u2019s not going to happen in every case, and in the case of your 16 year old niece, it\u2019s probably better to err on the side of caution.", "Unfortunately there ain't a lot of other types of people in the small town they live in. It's a rough place for queer people", "Idk my life experiences disagree. \n\nI'm curious why you say that? Like what does caution look like for you? And is there any way to be \"cautious\" in these situations without causing oneself trauma? \n\nSeriously curious because I haven't personally found any way to do that", "Different people have different experiences. To me, caution is to tell her to stand her ground but not engage. Clearly that guy took what she was saying as bait, and that\u2019s why their argument went on as long as it did. Homophobes and the like are feeling much bolder these days."]}
