Jess asked me if I could give her advice on it, and I gave her this advice:  \n\n\\- Sometimes people will try to \"debate\" you on your sexuality, I'd never engage. Even if you \"win\", debating your personhood will eat you up inside.   \n\n\\- Instead, know this about biggots. Their hate isn't about you. When someone shames another person, they are often coming from a place of deep internal shame, self-restriction, isolation, etc. They see self-denial as a virtue, to justify their own self-imposed restriction, and resent the person who's in true accord with themselves.   \n\n\\- They're deeply lonely, in a fearful place, having been indoctrinated to fear their fellow man. They're part of churches or organizations that maintain power and control through fear of the other - and you are unfortunately being \"othered\" as a propaganda tool.  \n\n\\- If someone tries to argue with you about your sexuality, ask them to reflect on themselves instead. Don't let them \"debate\" you - just keep reminding them that they only have to answer to themselves and to God.   \n\nI gave her all that advice and she listened, and felt better hearing that the shit people are saying about her is 100% not about her. But stuff got kinda rough when she went back to church next.   \n\nApparently one of her dad's friends was giving her the whole 'love the sinner hate the sin\" shit and she went off on him - asking him in front of everyone why he was getting so red in the face? Saying that she didn't want to debate her own sexuality. But she was concerned about him - that he was so clearly sad and afraid and ashamed that he was putting that pain out into the world. And she hoped he'd go home that day and reflect on whether he wanted to go through life letting fear and shame control and isolate him.   \n\nIt apparently made things really awkward, and made the guy madder. He got at her saying she didn't know him, and she was like \"I don't have to know you to see that... I'll pray for you...'   \n\nWhich damn - gen z is gutsy and honestly I was proud of her. But my sister was upset, she asked me if I'd told her daughter to call this guy sad and angry, and I said yeah, though just generally - not about that specific guy.  \n\nMy sister told me she thought I was setting her daughter up for trouble, that the stuff I suggested she say was gonna make a lot of people angry. I said those people were already angry.  \n\nShe said that advice wasn't age appropriate at all, and that I should have said more of the \"love yourself / self confidence\" stuff she wanted her daughter to be safee and worried about her saying that kinda thing.  \n\nAITA for the advice I gave?

She\u2019s not gonna have an easy go of it, speaking out like that every time someone approaches her like that, as in my experience, it just makes them madder and more insecure in themselves, but it\u2019s empowering for her, being able to stand up for herself like that.

They live in a small town that's pretty rough for that. People are very judgy and in each other's business, and unfortunate as it is, one person in a family being gay, especially the \"wrong type\" of gay (i.e. open about it instead of behind closed doors) can make a whole family outcasts socially", "She already does! She's lucky enough to have wonderful friends and family who have been there for her enough that she's never doubted herself.\n\nShe's just been struggling with how to deal with random people whose opinions she doesn't even want coming round and trying to 'debate' her when she doesn't want her humanity up for debate. So that's why my advice focused more on telling her that their BS is absolutely not about her, it's either their own emptiness, or their own indoctrination into hate, and that she should never lower herself to their level.. just point out that they're in a bad place to even be asking those questions. \n\nI honestly feel like the guys who are like \"I'm jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs / cAnT wE hAvE a dEbAtE???\" About some kid's humanity are the ones really trying to pick a fight.

Coming from a queer person who is not a shrinking violet at all, I\u2019m on your side but I can see your sister\u2019s point. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, LGBTQ+ life has specific risks that straight people rarely see. We accept those risks because it\u2019s worth it to live, laugh, love, roast bigots at church, etc. We\u2019ll walk past armed protesters to go to a drag show. We\u2019ll present ourselves how we want and shake off the side eye because it matters to be ourselves. \n\nYour sister\u2026 doesn\u2019t see or live with ANY of this on a regular basis. Her kid is going to have a different life than her and places that are friendly and safe for her will be hostile and potentially dangerous for her child. She just got an eyeful and earful of what it means to be a queer kid with a voice and a spine, at her own church, and it was not pretty. And your sister sounds like she might not be good at conflict and dealing with risks, like at all. She doesn\u2019t have your tried and true strategies because she hasn\u2019t lived that life.\n\nI would reinforce with her that her child was *already* in an unsafe situation before this guy started popping off. And that her daughter most likely *knew that* before a single word was spoken, has known that for years. Part of being a parent of a teenager is learning to trust your child\u2019s risk assessments, that\u2019s what parents are doing every time they take a step back from managing their kids\u2019 homework, hand their kids the car keys, fill out a FAFSA form. \n\nYour sister needs to learn to trust her daughter to handle situations. And not pull back that trust if something goes sideways. Your niece deserves to be the decision maker of her own life, around her queerness and around other things too. \n\nHowever, you may just want to follow up on your niece\u2019s risk assessment abilities and willingness to engage in conflict for good reasons, by taking her to a queer-friendly basic self-defense course that includes strategies for de-escalation and disengagement. Your sis should come too and learn more about how to be an active bystander.", "Yep, and they will never accept  her. It's hard debating people who have no real intentions of hearing you out.", "But she clearly heard it as \u201cwhen people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d rather than just telling them she wasn\u2019t going to debate her existence. All that was going to do was egg him on, as satisfying as saying could have been.", "I don't think the response is a wrong one at all. That's why i said NAH. I just think that if I were a mother, I could understand wanting my child to not go back and forth with those types of ppl because the worst of them can react in some horrible ways.", "Amen! \n\nSeriously though sister needs to find an LGBTQ+ friendly church. They are out there.", "> All that was going to do was egg him on\n\nHonestly I've seen it have the opposite effect\n \nI've used that trick for 15 years and honestly have never had someone come back for seconds after being told they seem deeply sad and that I was worried for them, since carrying that kind of anger can burn a person up inside.\n\n> \"when people want to debate you, here\u2019s how you tear them down,\u201d\n\nAlso no offense but as a queer girl in a deeply conservative religious area... That's an essential life skill if you want to keep any amount of dignity and self confidence. \n\nI've tried shrinking myself down to hide, and not to get to personal but it almost cost me my life. I'm not kidding when I say that's a survival skill - especially in terms of managing mental health", "\"Those types of people\" are their family friends, though. I say the parents are AHs for associating with \"those types of people\" in the first place.", "Yeah fair.

Tell them they seem sad and angry and say you don't want to talk, you just hope they think about what you just said, keeping it between themselves and God?

It's a rough place for queer people", "Idk my life experiences disagree. \n\nI'm curious why you say that? Like what does caution look like for you? And is there any way to be \"cautious\" in these situations without causing oneself trauma? \n\nSeriously curious because I haven't personally found any way to do that", "Different people have different experiences. To me, caution is to tell her to stand her ground but not engage. Clearly that guy took what she was saying as bait, and that\u2019s why their argument went on as long as it did. Homophobes and the like are feeling much bolder these days.", "NTA, and Jesus your niece sounds bloody awesome. Good for you both!", "NTA but I do think I understand the mom\u2019s concerns. I think she\u2019s just afraid her daughter will (rightfully) call out people the way OP taught, and that will cause someone (most likely a man in her mind) to physically react and take it out on her daughter. Which is a very real possibility and genuine fear to have. But the solution isn\u2019t to stop the niece from her actions. The solution is to make sure she\u2019s prepared to physically defend from others actions, if the worst were to happen. The fact is the way she\u2019s calling them is not wrong but it is a harsh reality and people can\u2019t handle being told harsh truths.", "NTA.  You gave her great advice, and she sounds like a great kid.\n\nGiven this is a friend of her husbands, I think your sister has some pretty serious self-reflection to do.  She shouldn't have been exposed to this kind of hateful rhetoric in the first place, and the fact that they blamed their *child* for... what, hurting his feelings? Instead of him for being shitty or themselves for allowing a bigot access to their child in the first place is pretty garbage.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should be more concerned about someone being homophobic toward her child than how said child reacts to it.", "NTA. You were real with your niece. She went to you for help for a reason. You did good by her!!", "NTA. You rock.\n\nYour sister should be supporting her child, not fretting about what bigots think.", "NTA, although teens may not have the best risk assessment and put themselves in danger sometimes. I know I did, I pick my battles more wisely now.

It's very strange that you feel entitled to force your opinion into a space it doesn't belong. I don't make decisions about my life based on strangers' comfort so leave me alone.\" \n\nOr simpler \"Yeah I'm uninterested in talking to you/being around you at all, leave me alone.\"", "NTA! That's an incredible age-appropriate way to explain it! Makes it clear it's all on the bigots, she's not responsible, but doing it in a way that gives her a way to respond with generosity and humanity. It's so hard not to get angry and discouraged, and this gives her the tools too keep herself and her perspective healthier in the face of all the bs in the world.

Sounds like your sister would rather her daughter 'turn the other cheek' to save her some embarrassment.  Not gay here, and I'll admit when I was younger I was a real asshole.  But I learned over many years how to keep an open mind.  I've come to the conclusion that a person's orientation or life choices don't make them any less human than I am.  So I treat everyone I meet the same, like I would want to be treated.  I have several friends of both genders (Haven't met anyone who identifies as anything else) and a few of them are out of the closet, so if I don't understand something I can ask.  They're comfortable enough talking to me about it.  \n\nPeople have the right to be who they are and who they want to be.  I'm not really religious anymore because I have found a lot of hypocrisy in organized religion.  I believe in God, and I believe that he gave mankind the greatest gift in the universe.  Free Will.  So unless he comes down here and tells us mortals that loving someone is wrong, then I'll go on believing things my own way.  \n\nAnyway, that's just me.  Your niece defended herself and everyone has that right too.  You did the right thing.  Nobody should have to put up with that kind of nonsense.", "So NTA. \n\nAs a parent of a queer child...the young people are fierce in who they are. I love it. Great advice. Keep being a great role model.", "what a hero man, as a fellow queer I gonna use your advice!", "NTA. You are a champion and so is Renee. Keep putting homophobes in their place and fuck anyone who tells you it\u2019s not \u201cnice\u201d to do so.", "NTA. I'm queer, my family is (im so thankful for this) all incredible allies. This child needs allies and support, and you are supporting her and teaching her how to support herself. You couldn't have done a better job, and hopefully her parents get on board as well.", "You did perfectly, thank you for not shying away from the truth \n\nAlso I find it funny watching the votes sway up and down\u2026 who\u2019s downvoting this lmfao", "NTA- I love the advice you gave your niece! Well done! Honestly, this is about your sister being more concerned about with the people in the church feel about her than how her daughter is doing. Keep giving her that wonderful sage advice.", "I have always wondered how many \u201ccolo-rectal surgeons \u201c there are on Reddit.", "And I totally agree with your sentiments.", "Unfortunately, people get violent with queer girls around here no matter what we do (or don't) say. Hell, usually more often if we don't say shit - looking meek seems to make these guys see you as an easier target", "AMEN!", "Your sister needs to realize the only thing that will make her daughter safer is to say those same things right along side her with her full chest. Let that man know that she has a whole family of love, acceptance, & support behind her that will not allow him or anyone like him an inch of hate unchallenged.", "If the family\u2019s church has people there who could put a child in danger if she says the wrong thing, mom needs to stop taking the child to that church. No child should ever be in danger from adults for saying something the adults don\u2019t like.", "Lol! We are pretty rare, from what I've seen.", "Okay so I\u2019m not gay, but I have a lot of invisible disabilities and mental health disorders and you saying this, even though I\u2019ve heard it before, just resonated with me and I\u2019m holding back tears. So thank you. \n\nIt\u2019s not about me. \n\nIf people judge me, it\u2019s not about me. \n\nIf people are upset I\u2019m using accommodations, it\u2019s not about me. \n\nThank you for being a strong role model for your niece. And thank you to your niece for being a force to be reckoned with and giving me home for a brighter future. \u2764\ufe0f", "Which is why it would be important to have your niece be in some kind of martial arts class. And may play more into your sisters concerns.", "Mum might have been afraid benraging him further could turn things physical.", "When I got to an age where I was starting to seriously think about having kids, I started researching LGBTQ+ affirming churches. I\u2019m straight and cis, but there\u2019s no guarantee any kids I have will be, and I wanted my hypothetical future kids to grow up knowing they were loved exactly as themselves. \n\nStill don\u2019t have kids, but I love my queer affirming church and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. OP\u2019s sister should start doing that same research if she really wants to support her daughter.", "Exactly right. I couldn't agree with you more.", "Then she is far beyond an AH to continue to be friends with such a person. If you think there is even a *remote* possibility that your \"friend\" might actually hurt your *child* in any way, shape, or form, then that person needs to be cut from your life entirely. Remaining \"friends\" with people you are afraid might legit bring harm to your family is indefensible.", "Then mom should have protected her child from a violent adult.", "Yeah that makes sense", ">continue to be friends with such a person\n\nIs she? I didn't read that anywhere.", "Just the fact that she's welcomed a bigot into her family circle at all is an AH move. Being \"friends\" with people who you could easily picture hurting your *children* if they don't conform to that person's own rigid ideals and worldviews is, again, indefensible.", "> caution is to tell her to stand her ground but not engage\n\nWhat does that practically look like for you? Because honestly, that's the exact advice I was giving.\n\nNever play the game of debating your own humanity, just stand up for yourself and refuse to roll in the muck with em", "Sphere of control dude. The first rule of life is that you cannot control anyone\u2019s reactions, only your own actions. Sure this guy\u2019s reaction is a useful form of feedback for OP\u2019s niece if she wants to know what might lead to an awkward 10 minute conversation and raised voices in the future, and this might not be the smartest approach if she\u2019s in a dark alley with no witnesses. But it sounds like she made a conscious choice on how she handled the situation based on her values and principles, and isn\u2019t displeased with the outcome. Being more risk averse is fine, but she\u2019s not. And like OP said, sometimes when we don\u2019t clap back all it means is that we\u2019re seen as a soft target. Not acting can be a risk of its own.\n\nPeople want to sit back and criticize marginalized people no matter how we handle discrimination. Maybe ask yourself why you think increased open homophobia means that queer people should make ourselves more responsible for deescalating bigots instead of making ourselves more responsible for pushing back on bigotry and standing up for our community when we\u2019re up to it.", "You say that,  it you gave her a list of debate points. Telling people that they have sadness or anger in their hearts, or that they\u2019re lonely or afraid or self-loathing isn\u2019t a way to disarm them, it\u2019s a way to piss them off, as evidenced by the guy that was confronting her. It\u2019s inviting confrontation.", "Still curious - what would you actually say instead?\n\nIf you know of a way to de escalate more effectively"]}
