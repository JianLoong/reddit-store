It really made us feel better and thank you guys for giving us advice on what to do next.\n\nWe spoke to my mother and father in law, and husband told them he didn\u2019t like that they were too afraid to say anything. Mother in law said that she was afraid since sister in law is very quick to go no contact with people. She seems to get sick of people in her life easily and cuts them out when she gets offended. Mother in law is afraid to not see her grandchildren. I get the fear, but it\u2019s still not right. I asked them if they at all offered, even inadvertently, for her kids to take the toys we left. They said definitely not. I believe them.\n\nMy husband called my brother in law and said (thanks to those who suggested this) \u201cHey! We were just over at mom and dads and there seems to have been some confusion. Our kiddos left some toys there to store and for all the grandkids to share and I think your wife thought we wanted to get rid of them. Total miscommunication, sorry about that. We\u2019re headed to the area and can swing by now to grab them!\u201d \n\nBrother in law said that was fine and he didn\u2019t even know they had them. So we swung by, he found them and helped us pack them all in the trunk. Sister in law was getting ready and came out as we were packing up. Her face got red, and she turned around and went back in the house. We stood out for awhile talking to brother in law until he checked his phone. He said he had to get inside and he went in to talk to his wife. We could hear through the walls that she was yelling and crying. \n\nAfter 10 minutes of extremely awkward looks between my husband and I, we texted him that we were going to head out and he came back out looking upset. He said his wife was crying inside and that she kept trying to go back and forth with why she had the toys and he was confused. We just played dumb and said that our kids couldn\u2019t find the toys we left when we went back and we\u2019re told that you guys had possibly \u201caccidentally\u201d taken them. He said he was sorry and we said our goodbyes and left.\n\nSister in law has since been posting about how family isn\u2019t blood and how she doesn\u2019t know who to trust anymore. I\u2019m sure it will blow over one day. \n\nWe also spoke with our children about how kind they were to want to share with their cousins.  That we are a kind and giving family but that doesn\u2019t mean that we let people take advantage of our kindness. That we understood that these were given to stay at Grandma and Grandpas and how upsetting it was that they weren\u2019t there, but that it was maybe a misunderstanding and mom and dad got them back now. I think they are too young now but one day they will realize how their Aunt is.  Thank you all for suggesting that we stand up for our kids.\n\nMy husband and I thank you for all the advice. Hope you all have a good holiday.", "created_utc": 1700626780, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1810mfa/update_wibta_if_i_asked_my_inlaws_to_return_my/", "score": 832, "replies": ["[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ymjh2/wibta_if_i_asked_my_inlaws_to_return_my_childrens/)", "Great update! SIL sounds completely unhinged.", "NTA but instead of leaving toys to share you now know that SIL is a greedy, entitled B and your kids need to bring toys to grandma's house and take them home when they go home.\n\nShe'll take anything you leave there.", "Hopefully now you know how to deal with her in the future. Play dumb, grey rock, act like everything's open and honest and in good faith and make it so that she'll have to openly put herself squarely in the wrong if she wants to try to take advantage of people. She'll absolutely hate it but it'll keep her from trying to pull shit.", "Brother in Law sounds like a G. Sister in Law sounds kinda crazy.", "NTA. Sounds to me like you did it just right. Phrasing it as a misunderstanding rather than theft likely saved a huge argument, hurt feelings, tantrums and some portion of the family relationship from the blowout it would have become.", "Wow!!! Excellent !!!", "Well played, love it!", "Oho! You submarined her; well done.", "I feel like it wasn\u2019t that action packed of an update but I\u2019m glad we got the stuff back!", "But now at least grandparents know to keep an eye on her when she is there...hopefully they will be able to stand up to her if she tries again (but I have my doubts).", "OP should write one of her own kid\u2019s names in big black sharpie on every.single.toy. Or put them in a large bin that\u2019s labeled \u201cOP Family Toy Bin\u201d and text the other sibs that their kids are welcome to play with the toys in that bin while at grandmas house.", "Absolutely, this is EXACTLY how you deal with somebody like that.", "oh idk seemed like plenty of action to me! You guys handled it really well.", "Seriously unhinged. You and your hubs handled this beautifully.", "You handled the situation very well.", "Thanks for that update.\n\nKudos to the commentor(s) who gave you the brilliant suggestion to play dumb, and kudos to you and your husband for \n\n1. handling the conversation so brilliantly! and\n2. talking honestly with the grandparents and doing the problem-solving so that they were not put between a rock and a hard place. (Maybe the success of your approach will inspire the grandparents to try the same approach in the future!)\n\nIt is clear that your BIL was not aware of SIL's aholery and is not likely to support it. That should also help you with future SIL issues.\n\nIt might be time to use a Sharpie or label-maker on the toys and put something like \"Grandma Jones' Family Toy Bin\" on the toys.", "What I don't understand is she is crying over toys. She's lost it.", "I'm so tired of reading how one person gets to bully a whole family into doing what they want by manipulation and threats. Good that you got your toys back but you also took the easy way out by not confronting her. I know it's not easy or pleasent but one day someone has to do it.", "Man, I do not envy SIL's kids. They're going to have a time. Nothing you can do about it unless it rises to Ruby Franke level stuff but damn, that's going to be a rough start to life.", "SIL needs help.  However, you guys handled this beautifully.  Bravo!", "Nice update. I feel kind of bad for your bil.", "Glad you got the toys back! It may also be helpful to write your kids\u2019 names on the toys or tags in permanent marker and maybe \u201cfor gma and gpa\u2019s house\u201d (depending on size/material) since so many kids visit their house. Keep the toys the kids really like at home because this may not be the only instance that this happens. \n\nAnd when your SIL throws a temper tantrum claiming you are targeting her, just tell her that you labeled the kids\u2019 toys with your kids in mind, not her.\n\n\nIt seems like kids and parents often feel entitled to \u201ccommunity\u201d items, believing that taking them is less harmful since they don\u2019t have a specific owner.", "[removed]", "OMG, Reddit is cool for suggesting, you're cool for implementing it perfectly!", "And can I just say what an amazing way to handle this situation. Other than SIL being too much, OP handled it all like a pro.", "It might be time to use a Sharpie or label-maker on the toys and put something like \"Grandma Jones' Family Toy Bin\" on the toys.", " I do not envy SIL's kids. They're going to have a time.", "I'm not sure direct confrontation would help.", "I think it's more that someone stood up to her and she couldn't get her own way than the toys themselves.", "She seriously sounds unhinged and in serious need of therapy and/or meds.", "I'm not sure direct confrontation would help. Do you know the saying that goes something like 'don't wrestle a pig, you both get dirty but the pig actuality enjoys it'? I think not engaging with SILs tantrum and being calm makes it clear who is the irrational person here and still gives the signal that SIL can't walk all over OPs family.", "This the definition of my cousins wife with my Aunt and Uncle. She\u2019s a strong anti vaxer who uses her kids against them if they so dare as speak up about their concerns. She\u2019s even trained the eldest two girls to \u201chang around\u201d my and Aunt and Uncle during family gatherings to listen in and report back to her what they say. She\u2019s a real piece of work and I feel bad for them because they\u2019re excellent people who do well by their kids and grandkids.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

We aren't mad and we still love you.\" A bit of being the bigger person while also preventing her from being able to spin the narrative in her favour.", "I feel like there will be quite a bit of fallout between your BiL and his wife...
