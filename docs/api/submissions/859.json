I am afraid it may never be that parent child relationship you deserve, but I hope for your sake you could at least reach a basic level of friendship.\n\nBy the way, at 16 you definitely still need a mothers love and reassurance and attention. Its not 'coddling'. But even if it were we all deserve to be coddled on occaision, and your mother certainly owes you and has a heck of lot of time to make up for. \nHeck I am in my 40's and I still need my mum like that.

Go back to living with your grandparents if they'll let you. She obviously doesn't care", "NTA, you are right. Your mom cares about dating more about finding a relationship with another man than developing one with her son. It\u2019s clear. She didn\u2019t prioritize you again, this isn\u2019t new behavior for her. I know you\u2019re making an effort into building a relationship but it takes two people putting in the work.

Consider the military once you\u2019re done with high school. \n\nYour mother has unresolved issues internally. Her ways are not about you, she is who she is.

It\u2019s very difficult to not expect the love and care that you want from your mom. A therapist will help you figure how to deal with all these feelings, set boundaries, help you to refocus your energy to building up yourself and not your mom.", "NTA. Your mom clearly didnt mean it when she said she wanted to be a real mother. Seems like she wanted to feel like a real mother by just having you in the house.

Your mom is worried about dating not mothering.", "NTA she claims to have matured and got her shit together, but she obviously has no idea how to be a mother. \nMaking a plan with her son to bond and do something fun is not coddling, that is specifically trying to build a bond with a child that she had little to no interest in. That lack of interest in bonding looks like it hasn't changed and your words to her are very true. \nI would say it's time to move back to your grandparents and make her prove that she's willing to invest time in you and prove that she really wants to build a relationship.

She made a choice about which one.\n\nNot only that, she broke plans with you for a better offer.\n\nIf she was dating two people and she broke plans with one to spend time with the other, nobody would question which person was more important to her.  \n\nOf course, \"important\" means different things.  It might be that she would take a bullet for you but not for him, for instance.  There may well be categories of \"important\" where you come out on top.  But in the specific category of \"want to spend time with\", you were simply telling the truth.\n\nNow, the fact that the statement was true isn't enough to prove that you weren't the asshole.  You can be plenty asshole without ever lying.  It also has to be a thing that had to be said, and not said in an unusually cruel way.\n\nAnd this meets both of those tests, too.  If your mother wants to build a relationship with you, she needs to know when she is succeeding and failing.

I couldn't either, at that age. But, you're better off leaving it alone now. It'll only hurt worse. Her promises are lies. Her lies are lies. Her fucking whatever is a lie. She only cares about herself. It's nothing to do with you. It says nothing about who you are. She's just a pathetically *old* woman who is facing the consequences of being a shit parent. You'll always be \"in her way\" bc she considers anyone who doesn't care solely about her as being *in her way.* She'll brag about your success, and when she credits herself, just smirk and feel bad for the next sucker to fall for her narcissistic Bs. \n\nOk. That was a little too.... Personal. I'm here for any advice you might need. Not only was my mom a horrible human being who treated me like a cute puppy... Until I wasn't \"cute\" anymore.
