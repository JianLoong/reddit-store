Tell her that you have no access to your son\u2019s share so this cannot be decided by you and also not by your son as it\u2019s in a trust. End of story.

You *cannot* split your son's share with her son. You aren't the one in charge of deciding these matters.

But the fact is, YOU have a legal requirement to follow his wishes... even if that does mean perpetuating his asshole move. \n\n\nIt's not a nice position to be stuck in, but it's what you've got. Do your job correctly and don't try to compensate with somebody else's money for a decision you didn't make.

If he didn't leave a will that included his younger son, that is not your problem.", "INFO: When you say \"legally he cannot inherit\", do you mean that your husband could have named the child in his will and chose not to?  If that was the case, your husband was TA for that (as well as for cheating).  \n\n\nOne possibility might be that you and the other woman and your son's lawyer could petition to be allowed to do a different split that would include an amount in trust for the other child.  (If your son's representative could make a case that this would be in his best interest, they might allow reducing your son's amount for this. )  But if it's not worth attempting that, then it would be very generous to look at sharing some of your money with a trust for the other child.  You would want legal help to get this documented, so it is clearly a gift and nobody would think it worthwhile to ask for more later.      \n\n\nAlso, if you can manage it, it would be generous for you to consider giving some memento of your husband to the child as well.

If your partner cheated on you, and then neglected to care for or pay for your child, you would not give the affair partner money out of guilt. No freaking way. That home wrecking ho has her money, she can put it in a trust for her child. It's a damn cheek for her to ask for more. You and your guilty conscience, wtf is with this?", "I mean if anything the karma is coming back on the affair partner", "no, my logic is that the law where OP lives is pretty straightforward and her ex didn't make provisions taking that into account before he passed.\n\ni was just disagreeing with your position.", ">the bigger person.\n\nThat's just a nice way of saying doormat.", "We were never divorced, only separated.\n\nHe married her a few years back.\n\nDoes that clarify for you?", "Yes, they worked together and she had met me at various work parties and socials years before the affair began. She even signed the card the dept sent for my son\u2019s birth", "At some point she had to have known. I mean, her son is illegitimate and there's no way she had no idea that he got divorced because of her with a son only 2 years older than her own", "Oh for fucks sake. She can fuck off then. No tears for cheaters and the trash that knowingly sleeps with cheaters.", "100% THIS!!!", "Wait does this mean your husband is a legal polygamist?", "NTA \n\nKeep that money, she already gets her share.. she can use that.", "She deserves to rot Im sorry OP! You\u2019re the best!", "OP said 'polygamy' in another comment, which would fit with the AP being culturally/religiously but not legally married, and maybe OP's husband hid OP", "nope nope nope.\n\nPlease give up **nothing** of yours. This woman had no problem breaking apart your marriage and now she has the gall to ask you for more?? \n\nUnbelievable.", "I think you are wondering if you are being ethical in sticking to the will\u2019s directions (even though you are legally clear) - You are ETHICALLY CORRECT in following the directive of the will.\n\nIt\u2019s pathetic to deal with all the emotional garbage being dumped on you. All the best to you and your son for a peaceful life ahead!", "Well, it doesn't seem like OP's ex or AP wanted them to have a relationship, so that's  a bit of a moot point", "Do you feel super cool? I bet you do.", "We get it bro you know how to use google", "I'm absolutely sure we're not dealing with US or Western European laws, as OP mentioned in a comment that she and the AP were BOTH legally married to the husband at the same time.  And if the husband considered the younger son as his child, he should have included him in his will. Why should OP give up HER share of the inheritance to AP's son - especially when AP received an equal amount?", "considering op mentioned religious law being a factor they are most likely not in any western country but in another part of the world where a man having more then one wife is legal.", "Apparently in another comment they had met many times before so he didn't", "That... was literally the point. OP gets to choose for her own child. \n\nIf that's what she wants, then offering a compromise might sway AP.\n\nWhat OP's ex wanted doesn't matter anymore. He chose when he was alive. In death he got to choose about the money. Now that he's dead, he doesn't get to make future parenting decisions, lol.", "maybe next time, come into a conversation from an informed point of view, instead of being caught in lies that easily.", "sorry for being credible \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/s", "Wow you\u2019re so intelligent, do you want a gold start sticker? You did such a good job using google, Im so proud <333", "I do see how gracious you are, after being caught out attempting to bullshit people.  \nthanks for giving everybody here a show.", "Look at you, using such big words!! Good job!! <3"]}
