Tell her that you have no access to your son\u2019s share so this cannot be decided by you and also not by your son as it\u2019s in a trust. End of story.

But the fact is, YOU have a legal requirement to follow his wishes... even if that does mean perpetuating his asshole move. \n\n\nIt's not a nice position to be stuck in, but it's what you've got. Do your job correctly and don't try to compensate with somebody else's money for a decision you didn't make.

If he didn't leave a will that included his younger son, that is not your problem.", "INFO: When you say \"legally he cannot inherit\", do you mean that your husband could have named the child in his will and chose not to?  If that was the case, your husband was TA for that (as well as for cheating).  \n\n\nOne possibility might be that you and the other woman and your son's lawyer could petition to be allowed to do a different split that would include an amount in trust for the other child.  (If your son's representative could make a case that this would be in his best interest, they might allow reducing your son's amount for this. )  But if it's not worth attempting that, then it would be very generous to look at sharing some of your money with a trust for the other child.  You would want legal help to get this documented, so it is clearly a gift and nobody would think it worthwhile to ask for more later.      \n\n\nAlso, if you can manage it, it would be generous for you to consider giving some memento of your husband to the child as well.

The husband made the choice to write the will as it, don\u2019t blame that on her - seems like the husband has a history of dick moves, and forcing her to be the \u2018bad guy\u2019 even from the grave.", "Yes as I said in the post we were both married to him by the time he died\n\nWas I not clear enough?

Ain't Karma a bitch.", "Right.  The child is not an AH according to most places' cultural norms.  But no one is beating this kid with a pipe; they're just following the will, inheritance law, *and* local customs by not giving him a share.  If his mom still has her share when *she* passes away, he will likely get a share in the end that way.  OP can correct me if my assumptions are wrong.", "So, even if he had left the kid out to keep you from finding out about his existence, he'd had a chance to rewrite the will once you knew about the cheating and he was supporting the other family.  I wonder if that's actually your late husband's choice as a half assed way of making it up to you.", "Here is my thinking.\n\nWhile legally you might be able to grab the money, morally your son has no more of a right to it than the other kid\n\nYour husband was an AH for cheating, but the other kid did nothing to you. The only reason why you are now in a position to keep the kid from getting some inheritance from his father is because your country has laws that privilege legitimate children over illegitimate children.\n\nIf you take advantage of that privilege for your/your son's benefit then you are endorsing the position of the laws. You need to feel comfortable saying \"because he is illegitimate he does not deserve an inheritance.\"\n\nI think the moral high ground lies with splitting the inheritance. That being said, you might set it up so that the other kid's portion cannot be accessed until he is an adult. This keeps it from being used to line his mother's pockets.", "For sure. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the \u201cright\u201d thing to do, it\u2019s just what I would do to make myself feel better.", "Its not but karma always comes back.", "cool completely meaningless to the conversation ;)....  \nand let us not get into all the legal fuck ups of that banana republic", "By that logic, OP's son is not the heir because he was not treated as a son later in life.

My in laws will be inheriting more than either of us tbh so she could ask them as they actually have a relationship with her and her son", "Yeah, no. That\u2019s the price women who get pregnant to married men pay. It\u2019s entirely on the AP kid\u2019s mother.", "Word, but I think if you were actually in this situation you wouldn\u2019t even be considering giving her money.

The Philippines for example, have similar laws.", "Yet that\u2019s not how the laws are set up.

It's sad that AP gets a share and her child doesn't. It should probably be the opposite if anything, but whatever, people can leave their money to whoever. \n\nOP's child lost their father twice, once to the affair, once to death, and gets more financial security now that the father has died than his half sibling\n \nAP's child lost their father once, in death, and had more fiscal support during the father's life than his half sibling.\n\nOP is getting money for herself, and OP's child is getting money as well. \n\nAP is getting money for herself and works a well-paying job. \n\nNeither child is going without their needs met, both are going to grow up with a reasonably similar standard of living, if I understand correctly.\n\nOP certainly doesn't owe AP any favors, so we're definitely going to have a not the AH situation here.\n\nMy only remaining question is for you, OP: Leaving the affair partner out of it, and thinking only of *your child*. Do you want *your child* to have a close personal relationship with his half-sibling?\n\nIf not, that's fine. I don't know your life, so not going to judge. \n\nIf you do, you might want to offer a compromise? Maybe have the other child over on some weekends or holidays for a sleepover with your child, and provide for the child's care on those days? Or... you get the point. Offer something, so that she'll be open to them evolving a relationship. \n\nEither way: NTA", ">any money I give would come out of my portion which is exactly the same amount as the other woman\u2019s\n\nWell that simplifies it. NTA. You don't have the power to split the money even if you wanted to.\n\nYour husband made it difficult to do it any other way, and you aren't obliged to trouble yourself to sort out his mess.\n\nIf she, or other people come after you, you can just say that you do not have the ability to split your son's trust. It is out of your hands.", "afaik, for example, in the philippines, the illegitimate child gets half the share of the legitimate one, and in absence of legitimate heirs, becomes the sole heir.'and the illegitimate heir becomes legitimate of the parents marry.\n\nand we really could go into, for example family code 195 (4)or do you want to go into the new civil code section IIIarticles 987 to 994? or 895 and 983\\`?", ">While he did marry his affair partner according to the relevant cultural and religious laws his son is still illegitimate.\n\nPretty sure we're not dealing with US or Western European inheritance laws here. I don't know what the local legality is, BUT based on the husband's behavior he obviously considered the younger son to be his child.", "Never made a call on TA, just pointed out the kindest thing to do.", "But didn\u2019t make provisions for him. That\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault.", "No, but from several of OP\u2019s responses he could have easily made his second child a beneficiary but chose not to. The child just does not automatically receive an inheritance the way the firstborn does because of how their laws are set up. However, that did not leave his father\u2019s hands tied; he could have made provisions but did not."]}
