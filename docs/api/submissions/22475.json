Call them out all day every day. Also feel free to post online (really, do it).", "NTA. Narcissistic a-holes think they can park illegally and not get reprimanded for doing so, you did the right thing calling her out", "I suppose that technically Y T A but I'm honestly so sick of people putting themselves before others at every opportunity that I'm going to say NTA.

I too, call \u2018em as I sees \u2018em.", "NTA I guess when she yelled she was going to call the cops next, it will be on herself! Those are no parking zones, and it is rude and inconsiderate to park there I guess her legs weren't broken,  because she went shopping. I wish cops  would drive through more.

No, not everyone does it but I\u2019ve seen the person try to stop the tow truck once before lol. \n\nYour frustration was valid but you gotta reign it in and not start these interactions in the first place.

Big SUV\u2019s taking up 1.3 carkarks, people zipping into parks you were indicating to go into first, diagonally parked across two whole parking spaces, people speeding and almost mowing down children and the elderly. \n\nThese people live for the pleasure of screwing up the natural order.\n\nBUT, you shouldn\u2019t have lowered yourself to her trashy level, so it pains me to say this\u2026 YTA.\n\nfollowed by a thumbs up .", "ESH.  You accomplished nothing with what you did.  Now she just feels like a victim and will keep doing.  If there\u2019s an issue call the police or complain at the store don\u2019t engage this way.", "YTA, you are not the parking police. It's not your job to tell people how to park and where to park. I'm pretty sure your city employs people to do that. Next time, give them a call if it is such a big issue. They probably won't do anything because of how petty it is, but it's not your responsibility", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
