Why not get the bill put in his name so if he doesn't pay it then it's on him.", "Would you REALLY kick him out over 1 missed bill? With 2 days notice? Or is it just an empty threat?", "Yes.

Unless you told him \"One strike and you're out!\", this is not what you agreed upon. \n2. As far as we know, you never requested to be given proof of lack of funds. So requesting to see his bank account was not in your good right. \n\nThe proportionate punishment for not paying the Internet bill should be changing the wifi password on him and not tell him. Not kicking him out of the house. \n\nYou missed a great opportunity to show your adult teenage son that you can be someone he can confide to : his car note and insurance bill unexpectedly rose up. That's suspicious. Did he get in an accident and didn't tell you? Is it something else that he spent his money on? You could have opened the conversation with him and offered to find a solution together, showing him that in the future, when he is a grown up with grown up problems he can still turn to big ol' mom to get some advice and reinsurance. Instead you pestered him and threatened to kick him out. \n\nThe fact that you're struggling as a single mother is ultimately not his problem. He didn't ask you to have 5 kids you can barely care for on your own. Don't take it out on him. Don't use his one slip up has an excuse to get rid off of a mouth to feed.

Techincally speaking, your son could be considered to be on a month to month oral lease agreement. In most states in the US you have to give 7 to 30 days notice of a termination of a month to month lease. If you want to treat your son like an adult, that's cool. But then you actually have to treat him as an adult. \n\nAlso, idk his situation. I live in one of the top 5 states with the most expensive car insurance in the US. The average monthly care insurance for drivers under 25 in my state is $450. It'd probably be closer to $650 with a car loan that's as high as his is.

Sounds like he\u2019s doing damn well for the rising inflation if he manages to pay for his own car and insurance. Why should he have to suffer more than he already is because YOU wanted to have not one, but several children? Having children is a selfish concept, and it becomes even more selfish when you fuck them out of a chance at a successful life. \n\nYTA", "Yep YTA. You should be loving and understanding toward your son. You are throwing him out with almost no notice.", "Your attitude in the comments mean YTA. Don't expect to maintain any real degree of respect from your children if you continue to go about things like that.", "You're also an adult who shouldn't have had five kids with deadbeats if you can't afford them. Maybe ask Jesus to provide your Wi-Fi", "You created a tenant situation and are attempting to illegally evict a tenant. YTA. Won\u2019t even touch the parenting stuff because, well, you chose to have a gaggle of kids you can\u2019t afford and decided that when they hit 18 you could use them to pay your bills apparently.", "As a working single mom of 3 kids, YTA. And completely ignorant.", "So how long have you wanted him out of the house for? Since he was 16 probably. YTA. 19 is not an adult, just because he is legally one.", "It\u2019s not his responsibility to pay *you* just because you can\u2019t financially sort yourself out.", "she\u2019s a single mom of 5 kids she can\u2019t afford and is evicting her struggling son. I imagine she really has never done much parenting.", "She's in Florida...so I just read about this 3 day eviction law in Florida. \n\nFor failure to pay RENT(not internet bill op...RENT) the landlord can give a written 3 day notice to begin eviction(weekends and holidays do not count). \n\nIn that 3 days the tenant has the decision to either pay the rent, or leave. If they pay the rent within the 3 days, the landlord must disregard the written notice.\n\nIf, after 3 days, the tenant neither pays the rent, nor has moved out, the landlord may begin filing the eviction process through the court. \n\nFew things here. Mom is NOT a landlord, son is NOT a legal tenant with a lease or monthly rent, nor did he pay a security deposit. \n\nOp truly thinks she's aeons smarter than she actually is when in reality she's just a cruel AH and an awful mother.", "That makes more sense. I didn't think to consider that it would be a one time yearly payment, and not a reoccuring monthly payment. Thanks for pointing that out. : )", "Imagine making a teenage boy homeless over an internet bill.", "I spoke to a lawyer today and it\u2019s completely legal in my state and I will call the court tomorrow to be on the safe side.", "Insurance is generally pretty high for young men, just as a matter of course. \n\nBut if his payments have gone up suddenly then, chances are, his policy was up for renewal, they pulled his record and found either an at-fault accident or multiple tickets.

It's you being too stupid to understand. Not very Christian either.", "Yes he will go no contact with her", "Florida. I am only required to give him 3 days notice", "Exactly!

Proud product of Florida's education system.", "Because according to op, he's a \"grown man\"....no, he's a teenager who doesn't have a fully developed prefrontal cortex.", "I replied to your other comment. Just because it's legal doesn't make it right. 2 days is genuinely cruel...and from his own mother, that's even more cruel.", "And what State is that?! Because a quick google search states you are completely wrong.", "Wtf. You are actually going to make you kid homeless on 2 days???\n\nAnd talk to a lawyer????\n\nI change my view.", "You really hate your son don\u2019t you", "You mean your criminal lawyer, or your bankruptcy attorney? You can't afford your internet bill but you've got lawyer money? Stop popping out kids you don't want to parent.", "Absolutely. This behaviour is exactly how you wind up with your kids going low or no contact.", "You are an awful parent.", "Even if you give notice, you still need to file in court and wait for a judge to hear the case. You can\u2019t just kick him out on day 3. Also, weekends don\u2019t count.", "Oh big yikes. I think your lawyer misunderstood your question or you didn't ask it right. In Florida, landlords must give a 7 days notice to pay rent or be evicted. Then, if after 7 days the tenant hasn't paid rent, the landlord can give a 3 day notice of intent to file eviction with the court. Finally, if the tenant still hasn't paid rent and its been 3 days since you've given notice, then you can file for eviction in court which takes 14 to 28 days in Florida (on average; could be longer or shorter depeneding on what's on the local docket). However, that's all assuming that you have signed long term rental contract in place with your son, which you said you don't have. \n\nIn that case, your son is officially on an oral month to month lease since you made an oral agreement to have a specific amount be paid towards a bill. That means that you must give him no less than 15 days **before** the next bill/rent/payment is due before you send a 15 day notice to evict. \n\nOf course, if you lie and say your son is a squatter and you had no such agreement with him that he could remain living in your house so long as he pays the internet bill, then you could claim he's a squatter. In which case, I guess you can give him **3 business days** notice to vacate or be evicted, which would mean that officially you'd have to wait until February 3rd to file an eviction with the court. But good luck with that because you done posted your case information on reddit. \n\nTake this advice from an actual landlord in Florida. If you fuck this up you could end up owing him thousands of dollars for illegally evicting him. Take this shit down and reevaluate your life choices. You do not know what you are doing.", "From what he's describe he's at least trying to do well as a grown man, sounds like he's doing fairly well. He'd be doing better without a insufferable mother evicting him with barely any notice over a bill that at max would be 130, a luxury bill at that.", "Extremely cruel. People seem to think they can stop being parents and treat their kids like crap once they hit 18.", "She's in Florida so that's a low bar, but she still managed it.", "That\u2019s not what the lawyer told me.", "My son isn\u2019t on the lease and never was. Therefore I only have to give him 3 day notice legally if that\u2019s what I choose and really i can evict him at any time with *no* notice according to what I was told by a lawyer. Everything you explained would be correct *if* he was a tenant or was on the lease, in which he is not - so none of that applies to me.", "Thank you!! Like wtf is wrong with her?? OP your a complete asshole for this one. Hope you don\u2019t expect your kids to take care of you when something happens. Internet is a want, not a need.", "And again, and I cannot stress this enough, for a <200 luxary bill when this young man pays for his own car, insurance and phone already. Cruelty does not even begin to describe it.", "Google it. It\u2019s not rocket science. In two seconds here\u2019s what comes up: If you do not reach an agreement with your landlord, or pay the rent that is owed and the three days pass, you will have to prepare yourself for an eviction. The landlord will file at the courthouse, and you will receive a court date. If the landlord prevails and your eviction is granted by a judge, you will have only a few days to move out of the property. If you want to stay in the property, it is essential to resolve any disputes you can with the landlord as soon as you receive a 3-Day Notice.", "Why do you hate your son?", "You taking parenting advice from the lawyer too? Good fucking luck with that.", "I think you might be confused. This is AITA, which you clearly are goatse levels of, not am I legally in the clear. FYI, when you are wondering why your child doesn't talk to you anymore.... Remember this moment.", "All this over an INTERNET bill is LUDICROUS \u2620\ufe0f Good lord you\u2019re blowing this out of proportion", "I don't think you understand. The notice is a warning that you will follow through with eviction proceedings if he does not vacate in 3 days. Youd still have to file in court if he doesn't leave, which is clearly money you don't have if you can't cover your own bills while he sorts out his own.", "Cool. So you're going to go to court,  look a judge straight in the eye, and tell them that your son is a squatter who is illegally occupying a room in a place that you rent? And you're going to do it without notifying your landlord? \n\nAwesome plan! There's absolutely no way that can turn out badly for you. /s", "Just because he\u2019s not on the lease doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t established tenancy. If he\u2019s lived there more than 14 days in a six month period (FL law) he\u2019s likely established tenancy, and if he has bills coming to the address he can prove it. \n\nYou are probably referring to a 3-day notice to quit, which is a three day deadline before filling for an eviction in court. You cannot kick him out until it\u2019s gone through the courts. \n\nIf you\u2019re so strapped for cash that your kid not paying the internet bill for a month is what you consider to be grounds for eviction I seriously doubt you\u2019ve hired a lawyer, and if you have they are giving you terrible advice. And no Google is not a lawyer. If you kick him out after three days he can sue you for illegal eviction, and he will win.", "and 2 days. Not even 30 days. But 2. Which means he may not get a pay to sort it out. \n\nWow. \n\nChanged my view entirely.", "Well it\u2019s my house and he has to be out by the first and I am within my rights to do so, even a lawyer told me that. He isn\u2019t just a few days past his bill, he\u2019s over a month. I gave him notice, and you\u2019re right, excluding weekends so he has to be out by the 2nd at the latest.", "You\u2019re right, I posted to AITA, and she replied attempting to give me legal advice on something she clearly knows nothing of. I didn\u2019t ask her to give her unsolicited legal advice, I just asked if I was the AH giving all the info of me not being paid.", "Also not true. And by the 1% chance it is, I will file the motion with the court in the morning.", "He has a PO Box. There is no mail coming to my address with his name on it.", "Lol sure. And then he can sue for unlawful eviction. You\u2019re terrible", "Why do you hate your son?", "You write this, and still ask if YTA?  Oh, you are.

You sound like you're looking for an excuse to throw him out. That's absolutely terrible! And if we're technically speaking, since it is your house, the internet bill is yours.
