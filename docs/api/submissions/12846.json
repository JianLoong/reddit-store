Pants are a little more forgiving since there\u2019s underwear that are changed daily. \n\nI shower every day and am a clean person but if I wear my work shirt two days in a row it definitely gets funky.

Just because your co-workers don't say anything doesn't mean that they aren't bothered by your smell.   I've worked with people like that.  They don't notice their own smell and mistakenly think that no one else does either.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you bathe daily as you said, then you may not have a smell that is noticeable and your roommate is just being nasty towards you.

I only bought a few more because I was tires of doing so much laundry. Especially working in a office though, you can wear pants a few times before they need to be washed.

Either buy more clothes or wash your clothes during the week.", "NTA but your roommate might be right that you smell more than you think and should have more clothes or wash them more frequently. Your coworkers are unlikely to tell you that you smell bad to them. It is really hard to tell someone that politely. \n\nI would say definitely wash things after they are worn twice. I would get at least 1 more pair of pants. If you can afford it then getting enough clothes to wear something fresh daily to work would be best.", "I feel like \"vest\" means something very different than it does in the US.

Because that's going to be the most affected, even if the outer shirt isn't buttoned. \n\n\nPersonally, I think perfume makes smells much worse. And will linger on the clothes that are unwashed, so that's probably worse, too.\n\n\nWhat do you do if you spill food on one shirt or something on Monday? 3 shirts only sounds like absolutely no leeway in case something happens to one shirt?\n\n\nSmell aside, people are probably judging you if you're wearing only 3 shirts ever. Doesn't make you an AH, but is going to make them question your social skills, cleanliness, etc.", "YTA\n\nIf your roommate says you stink - believe them.

My employer strongly discourages perfume in the open floor plan areas because what smells good to you stinks to someone else and perfume allergies are a thing.  People who regularly wear perfume tend to escalate their usage due to becoming nose blind to their own artificial scent.  So the rule is we don't want you wearing it, and if you do it anyway and anyone complains it is on you.  Basically if anyone regularly wears perfume or cologne and someone else decides to complain instead of approaching the person directly, the overly scented person is going to have a rather uncomfortable conversation with a manager.  \n\nNot every employer has rules like this, but better to check that yours doesn't now than be blindsided about it later.", "How long do you work?

Luckily I have more now so it\u2019s not an issue but it definitely made me feel weird. \n\nThe hair is a good point but I think the roommate would be able to tell.", "Pants are much less of a problem when it comes to bad smell. I'd still get another pair, maybe two. If you happen to get your pants dirty on Monday, that means you'll have to wear the other pair for 4 days. Not the end of the world, and I've personally had to do that, but having another pair allows for better rotation.\n\nMost people I know will wear pants 2 or 3 times before washing them, as long as they're not visibly dirty. Shirts and undergarments are really the only things that need to be worn once, then washed.\n\nAlso, having a few more clothing items means that you're distributing the wear and tear over more items of clothing so you're not constantly replacing clothes. It also allows you more time to actually get replacements since you already have enough in your wardrobe to get by for a week or two if needed. Just think if you ripped one of your two pairs of pants...you'd really need to get another pair ASAP. If you have 3 pairs of pants and one ripped, you can get by with the other two pairs for a week or more if needed.\n\nI have a minimal wardrobe and I like it that way, but I've also learned that it's best to have a few more items than you actually **need**, just in case!", "I'd say invest in a couple shirts.

Tuesday, wear pair B and Tuesday night hang them to air out. Then Wednesday it is back to pair A and so on. This might help reduce any possible odor or odor causing bacteria. \n\nI did that for years and never had an issue. Plus, people tend to notice if you wear the same shirt over and over, but if you only wear black pants, then they won't really notice a difference.", "I would go for the shirts. Especially since people recognize the shirts when they talk with you but not so much the pants. And even if you don't smell, if they see you wearing the same shirt in one week, the try to pick up a smell that isn't there because some people just find this yuck.", "And deodorant", "Plus, with this, you can actually wait and shop the sales. I knew a wife who, at the end of the winter and summer seasons, would hit the department store and buy her husband clearance shirt and tie sets. She generally got them for 60-80% off. The husband had really bad sweat problems, and generally, the arm pits of his shirts were stained by the end of the season; that was with the shirts being sent to the dry cleaners weekly.", "If you ask anyone at work - I would ask a supervisor. Don't overexplain, but just say something like your roommate made a recent comment about body odor, but given that you shower daily, you're not sure how accurate that comment was...so you're checking in to see if anyone at work has noticed a problem, and if there is a problem then you'll take steps to correct it.\n\nTheoretically, supervisors shouldn't be gossiping to others about a confidential conversation. It does happen...but I think it's less likely to happen than if you asked a coworker, especially since you're new on the job. Also, supervisors are more likely to appreciate an honest question and taking the initiative to improve if needed.", "Yes! I forgot about that part, thank you for mentioning it!", "You need some kind of deodorant or antiperspirant.

If you cannot smell anything, you might if you put the shirt down overnight then sniff the underarm part the next day.\n\nBody hair can carry and hold odour. Soap doesn't wash any hair very well, it is better to use shower gel on armpits and shaving does cut the body odour down. (Make sure your anti perspirant is also a deodorant.)  The same can be said for err...a full bush so to speak as for hair holding odours.\n\nI developed an allergy to certain shampoos and had to stop using any shampoo for a while until things cleared up. My natural hair oils certainly made my hair stink very quickly.\n\nAs long as knickers are worn trousers can certainly be worn a lot longer.\n\nThe least to buy - one in the wash, one to wear.

Humans have many different levels of personal smells and the people freaking out over not washing a shirt every time it\u2019s worn are being silly.\n\nFor frugality, sleeves on your undershirt will also help with keeping your work shirts clean as they will have less contact with your skin.", "FWIW for a lot of people in office environments perfume can be overpowering and be arguably worse than even the worst BO.\n\nBO can stink.
