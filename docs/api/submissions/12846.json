If your roommate isn\u2019t just an ass in general, I\u2019d take this to heart and just get two more shirts. Pants are a little more forgiving since there\u2019s underwear that are changed daily. \n\nI shower every day and am a clean person but if I wear my work shirt two days in a row it definitely gets funky. And if my coworker smelled I wouldn\u2019t say shit because that\u2019s awkward but if my friend smelled I would let them know because that\u2019s what a friend does.", "This is a tough one.  Just because your co-workers don't say anything doesn't mean that they aren't bothered by your smell.   I've worked with people like that.  They don't notice their own smell and mistakenly think that no one else does either.  \n\nOn the other hand, if you bathe daily as you said, then you may not have a smell that is noticeable and your roommate is just being nasty towards you.  Do you all have other issues?  Do you normally get along?  Are you actually friends?  \n\nA third possibility is that you do have a faint odor and she is more sensitive to it than most people.", "NTA, if possible ask someone else you trust but I used to own only 3 sets of work clothes for the office as well. I only bought a few more because I was tires of doing so much laundry. Especially working in a office though, you can wear pants a few times before they need to be washed. Hell jeans are better off being washed only when dirty or when they smell (usually once every couple weeks depending on physical activity).", "NTA- Washing outerwear after 8 hours of merely existing in them is an unnecessary standard.", "NTA.\n\nDid your roommate says this because she thinks you actually stink or because she assumes your clothing is dirty because you wear it often?\n\n If it\u2019s a confidence boost for you to buy additional clothing to wear, by all means do so as you have the available funds to do so. But as long as you are clean and aren\u2019t bothering anyone at work, I don\u2019t see the issue. You\u2019re there to get a job done.", "I think a clean shirt and undies and socks every day is a minimum at work.  \n\nI usually wear clean trousers (pants) most days but in an emergency laundry situation 2 days for them is ok.", "NAH. Buy a few more shirts so you can wear a fresh shirt/underwear/socks every day and wash on the weekends. Unless your roommate has a habit of lying to you, accept her judgment.", "YTA....go buy some more shirts and at least 2 more pants.", "YTA. You really don\u2019t want to be the stinky lady. Your roommate is doing you a solid by telling you. Either buy more clothes or wash your clothes during the week.", "NTA but your roommate might be right that you smell more than you think and should have more clothes or wash them more frequently. Your coworkers are unlikely to tell you that you smell bad to them. It is really hard to tell someone that politely. \n\nI would say definitely wash things after they are worn twice. I would get at least 1 more pair of pants. If you can afford it then getting enough clothes to wear something fresh daily to work would be best.", "I feel like \"vest\" means something very different than it does in the US. Because I can't picture a vest as under wear with a shirt over it. Namely, does the vest cover the armpits? Because that's going to be the most affected, even if the outer shirt isn't buttoned. \n\n\nPersonally, I think perfume makes smells much worse. And will linger on the clothes that are unwashed, so that's probably worse, too.\n\n\nWhat do you do if you spill food on one shirt or something on Monday? 3 shirts only sounds like absolutely no leeway in case something happens to one shirt?\n\n\nSmell aside, people are probably judging you if you're wearing only 3 shirts ever. Doesn't make you an AH, but is going to make them question your social skills, cleanliness, etc.", "YTA\n\nIf your roommate says you stink - believe them. And if you do laundry on weekends only, get 5 sets of work clothes so that you're not wearing unwashed clothing on 2 days of the week.", "NTA.\nIf and when people at work complain, make a decision then. Your roommate doesn't get to imagine something happening and then complain about it (especially since it wouldn't even affect her if it *was* happening)", "3 pairs of pants is fine. Pants don't need to be laundered super often. You should be wearing a fresh shirt, underwear, and socks every day, so buy accordingly.", "I don't think you stink, I am kinda the same as you, I don't have uniform either, so I have 2-3 pants but 5 shirts. Usually I only use 2 pants a week, but I do use the 5 shirts, just to avoid smelling xD", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You never know when something will tear or get stained. Not sure if Y T A or not cause maybe you do smell and maybe your roommate is a jerk.", "NTA. Only buy what you can afford.

Do you think they are sitting around going \"wow, I really smell disgusting, I can't stand it\"? No, they don't notice. \n\n\nI doubt you stink that bad, but it feels like common sense that you are less aware of your own smell. \n\n\nDo you wear the same shirts multiple days in a row for not work?", "I wouldn't ask people. \n\n\nI doubt that one day makes your smell particularly noticeable to coworkers, or able to pinpoint to you, even if they smell it. Do you spend a long time sitting close to one specific person?", "Since you are new to work and it sounds like you are in a somewhat open floor plan based on your comment about being over in the corner, I suggest you check and see if there is a set of employee guidelines.   My employer strongly discourages perfume in the open floor plan areas because what smells good to you stinks to someone else and perfume allergies are a thing.  People who regularly wear perfume tend to escalate their usage due to becoming nose blind to their own artificial scent.  So the rule is we don't want you wearing it, and if you do it anyway and anyone complains it is on you.  Basically if anyone regularly wears perfume or cologne and someone else decides to complain instead of approaching the person directly, the overly scented person is going to have a rather uncomfortable conversation with a manager.  \n\nNot every employer has rules like this, but better to check that yours doesn't now than be blindsided about it later.", "How long do you work? Is it not an 8 hour day? So, getting dressed/ready for work, getting to work, going home...that's gotta be 9-10 hours a day at minimum. And then you wear it twice, so 18-20 before washing. \n\n\nThis sounds like you're negating your initial point.", "You can not rely on your own nose\n\nPeople go nose blind to their own odor and often have no idea that they actually smell bad until someone points it out\n\nIt is entirely possible you don't stink, but have a musk that you are nose blind to but your roommate is not since they live with you", "I'd get a third party's opinion if possible. Some people say others are stinky simply because they wear the same things all the time. In summer, yeah, I need to change my clothes daily but winter? No, not if I'm not doing a lot.", "A few extra shirts can\u2019t hurt- when you say a vest I\u2019m assuming you mean a sleeveless undershirt?  That may not protect your over shirt enough from any sweat/odours from under arms, because the outer shirt can still make contact with the skin. \n\nYou sound hygienic- but do you also use deodorant/anti perspirants?

There are definitely different styles that'd hold sweat more than others.", "Could be the problem,  sometimes a perfume and body odour can combine into a weird smell.  \n\nI know there are lots of countries where deodorants are not common, so living where there are different standards makes people more sensitive to anything different. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like anti perspirants for their additives, they are coming out with vegan ones, more natural ones,  there is more variety now.", "Why would you expect her to touch them?\n\n\nYou say \"she won't even touch them,\" like that's something on her.", "If this chair is not in your own space, don't do that.
