Drunk or not, you don't deserve to sit in a car with someone verbally attacking you. The hospital, given her impaired state, is entirely a reasonable choice as opposed to just putting her out on the street.\n\nYou don't owe her a long ride home if she's going to go off on you and attack and insult you the entire way. Seeing as how she was drunk enough to lose it like that, it might not even have been SAFE to drive all that way. I've seen drunk men and women gab the wheel or try to jump out of a moving vehicle just to he spiteful.\n\nIt wasn't a relationship, and if she wanted more or expected more, then it is her responsibility to communicate what she wants and not have a drunken explosion about it. You don't owe her, or anyone, a relationship just because they want one, and you're allowed to walk away from someone.\n\nYou left her somewhere safe, rather than ditching her entirely, which is honestly more than what others would do in your situation. She is likely not being truthful with her friends about how she spoke to you, or may not fully remember. Either way, that is her responsibility, not yours. It's also responsible of you to have put her in a hospital so, in her anger, she cannot spitefully accuse you of anything to try to further punish you for not being exclusive with her or for \"cheating\".. which, again... you weren't even in a relationship TO CHEAT ON to BEGIN WITH.\n\nMy advice is to step back and move on from her and her friends, because she is not an honest person and is insecure and jealous, retaliatory. \n\nIf the rules were reversed and you were a line woman in a car with an angry, drunk, insulting and verbally hostile man, nobody would have batted an eye at you for getting out of that situation as fast as you did. If anything, you would be met, I think, with people deeming it too NICE that you cared for her safety enough to leave her at a hospital. \n\nWe don't owe anyone our time, and we aren't punching bags physically OR verbally, just because someone else is upset with us. She doesn't respect you, or she wouldn't have attacked you on such deep levels or gone after your appearance/forced you into a weird \"competition\" with other men she's been with before by comparing you and implying you are a downgrade. Those are the words of an insecure person who cannot properly handle or process their own emotions or desires. You aren't her therapist, and don't owe her free pot shots just because she can't say how she really feels or can't keep to her word.\n\nDrunk words are still our words. Same way drunk actions are still our actions. Cheating while drunk, beating someone while drunk, is still doing thise things. Verbal abuse while drunk is still verbal abuse. It took me a long time to realize this.", "NTA\nmight not be a popular opinion but driving next to an angry drunk who verbally abused the driver could lead to a more dangerous situation. she could have lost control and lunged at him and that would have been disastrous with multiple car accidents. \n\ndropping her in a safe space as soon as possible seems like a better move than taking the risk for another 30min drive.", "Yeah that's definitely \"get the fuck out of my car\" material and the safest place to do it.

If she had gotten boisterous she could have acted in a way that got the car crashed, or she could have laid into you with you ending up arrested or worse.

You. Can\u2019t just kick me out where do I go.\u201d\n\nHe let me in and stormed onto the terrace and called 911. I didn\u2019t know until the next day when I was discharged and back home that he told 911 I was threatening my own life. I was forcibly taken away in an ambulance to a public hospital where I was immediately threatened with a strip search and restraints when I kept saying I didn\u2019t want to be there and I wanted to go home.\n\nI was forcibly admitted to the non emergency psych ward. I was not too drunk that I needed any more treatment but in NYC due to updated mental hygiene laws, doctors can choose to hold anyone who is intoxicated and the mean condescending doctor I got could smell it on me.\n\nNo one at the hospital would listen to me and I was bewildered about why I was tossed into the psych ward. I was locked up against my will with no explanation about what would happen next. My phone was taken from me so I couldn\u2019t ask anyone for help or to advocate for me. Mg clothes were taken away. It was horrible and I was in a panic. \n\nWhen I got home the next afternoon after finally getting discharged and told my boyfriend what happened he smugly said \u201coh so they listened to what I said on the 911 call\u201d and that\u2019s how I found out he lied to them to get me taken away.\n\nESH.

It's dangerous to drive with someone screaming at you and acting, well, belligerent.\n\nEmergency services help prevent shit too.

I agree that, unless he felt immediately endangered, his best bet would have been to remember she is drunk, try not to take what she is saying personally, and just take her home.\n\n I am moreso arguing that hospitals *should* be equipped to care for drunk people, the same way they are equipped to care for people who are experiencing a bad trip.  We tend to view belligerent drunks as angry people who are taking up hospital resources, but that's not really empathetic to them.  They're using a drug that is causing a mental health problem for them and can affect them in devastating ways.  There's no reason for the hospital to not be a safe space for them. Instead of shaming people for taking up resources, shouldn't we be fighting to get hospitals *more* resources so that they can continue being a safe space for anybody who is experiencing a mental or physical health issue?\n\nAdditionally, if he felt unsafe driving her the rest of the way home, calling the police would be far worse than taking her to the ER, where she can be monitored for medical issues and given water and a safe place to sleep.
