Of course you don\u2019t need to hang out with her in the future, but if you just dropped her off at the hospital for someone else to come pick her up, you should have just dropped her off at home and been done with her.", "People seem to think that you owe an abusive person your time. Drunk or not, you don't deserve to sit in a car with someone verbally attacking you. The hospital, given her impaired state, is entirely a reasonable choice as opposed to just putting her out on the street.\n\nYou don't owe her a long ride home if she's going to go off on you and attack and insult you the entire way. Seeing as how she was drunk enough to lose it like that, it might not even have been SAFE to drive all that way. I've seen drunk men and women gab the wheel or try to jump out of a moving vehicle just to he spiteful.\n\nIt wasn't a relationship, and if she wanted more or expected more, then it is her responsibility to communicate what she wants and not have a drunken explosion about it. You don't owe her, or anyone, a relationship just because they want one, and you're allowed to walk away from someone.\n\nYou left her somewhere safe, rather than ditching her entirely, which is honestly more than what others would do in your situation. She is likely not being truthful with her friends about how she spoke to you, or may not fully remember. Either way, that is her responsibility, not yours. It's also responsible of you to have put her in a hospital so, in her anger, she cannot spitefully accuse you of anything to try to further punish you for not being exclusive with her or for \"cheating\".. which, again... you weren't even in a relationship TO CHEAT ON to BEGIN WITH.\n\nMy advice is to step back and move on from her and her friends, because she is not an honest person and is insecure and jealous, retaliatory. \n\nIf the rules were reversed and you were a line woman in a car with an angry, drunk, insulting and verbally hostile man, nobody would have batted an eye at you for getting out of that situation as fast as you did. If anything, you would be met, I think, with people deeming it too NICE that you cared for her safety enough to leave her at a hospital. \n\nWe don't owe anyone our time, and we aren't punching bags physically OR verbally, just because someone else is upset with us. She doesn't respect you, or she wouldn't have attacked you on such deep levels or gone after your appearance/forced you into a weird \"competition\" with other men she's been with before by comparing you and implying you are a downgrade. Those are the words of an insecure person who cannot properly handle or process their own emotions or desires. You aren't her therapist, and don't owe her free pot shots just because she can't say how she really feels or can't keep to her word.\n\nDrunk words are still our words. Same way drunk actions are still our actions. Cheating while drunk, beating someone while drunk, is still doing thise things. Verbal abuse while drunk is still verbal abuse. It took me a long time to realize this.", "NTA\nmight not be a popular opinion but driving next to an angry drunk who verbally abused the driver could lead to a more dangerous situation. she could have lost control and lunged at him and that would have been disastrous with multiple car accidents. \n\ndropping her in a safe space as soon as possible seems like a better move than taking the risk for another 30min drive.", "Yeah that's definitely \"get the fuck out of my car\" material and the safest place to do it.

If she had gotten boisterous she could have acted in a way that got the car crashed, or she could have laid into you with you ending up arrested or worse.

She's drunk and accusing you of things already.  Women protect themselves in all sorts of situations.  You did the same for yourself.  Don't feel bad at all!", "NTA.
