He said yes, let me just finish my conversation, I said Ok.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of waiting, I tell him again that I was tired so we needed to leave. He told me to wait 5 more minutes.\n\nBut those 5 minutes quickly turned into 10, those 10 into 20 and 20 into 30 minutes.\n\nAt this point,I was getting angry because he already promised me we\u2019d leave early but it was now close to midnight and he was still talking. \n\nI go to him again and tell him that if he\u2019s having fun and wants to stay then I can ask his sister to drive him home as it\u2019s on her way. \nHe said no and that he was coming. I told him that i was really tired and would leave without him if he wasn\u2019t there in 5 minutes.  He said he\u2019d be there.\n\nIt\u2019s without surprise that after 5 minutes, he was still not here but was having another conversation with someone else. \n\nI go to him one last time and tell him I\u2019m leaving, I guess he didn\u2019t heard because he didn\u2019t react.\n\nBefore leaving, I go to his sister and ask if she can drives him home, she said she would so I thanked her and I left.\n\nMy boyfriend called me 10 minutes after to ask where I was. I told him I left because I was tired and he wouldn\u2019t leave. \nHe called me an AH and hung up. \n\nHe texted me right after and told me that I was an ah for leaving without him, that he was just talking with his friends and that it wouldn\u2019t have killed me to wait a little more. He blocked me right after that and slept at his sister\u2019s house.\n\nI texted her and she told me he just need time to cool down and that me leaving without him had really hurt him. \n\nNo news since, from him or his sister. \n\nWas I the AH to leave without him ? Perhaps it\u2019s true that I could\u2019ve waited till he finished talking.", "created_utc": 1691267962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j62wi/aita_for_going_home_without_my_boyfriend_because/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He owes you an apology.", "1. You set a boundary. He ignored it several times  \n2. You made sure he had a lift home  \n3. It's not safe to drive when you're overly tired. You did the right thing  \n4. He blocked you which is being petulant and immature.  \n5. You're better off without him if this is how he treats you  \n6.

Why does his wants come before your needs? You made it clear before the party that you needed to leave early and he agreed, but decided something else in his head. He said that 'It wouldn't have killed you to wait a little more' meaning that he had no intention of wrapping up his convo in 5 minutes and planned to make you wait as long as he wanted. He had the right to want to speak with his friends, but why did he want to force you to stay when you were tired and his sister was there and could drive him? This is an AH move, but it's him blocking you that would have me blocking him from my life. - NTA", "NTA. You had to ask his sister if she can drive him home??? He is 27, not 7.

You gave him a warning prior to going. You let him know when you wanted to go. You reminded him you wanted to go. You gave him a final countdown to when you were leaving. At this point I think most people would have left without him. Making people wait for you like that is a power trip. It basically is saying that your needs are less important.

NTA; let him wallow in his own self-pity.", "NTA.  You have a self-centered boyfriend", "No. You set a rule, he agreed to it, and you gave him many reminders and chances to leave. \n\nYou even took the time to find another driver.

Gave planty of warnings after establishing a boundary.   NTA", "NTA. You warned him multiple times and gave im many opportunities to leave. He can dry his eyes.", "No...of course not.  Rather...he's the AH as he obviously doesn't respect you, the agreement the two of you had and be extension...your relationship.  Kick his ass to the curb...you can find 'worthless' anywhere.", "NTA.

Making sure you say your goodbyes *before* the time you were already aware you would have to leave by so that your significant other can drive home without possibly killing one or both of you from falling asleep at the wheel (or without making the SO unable to function properly at work the next morning and possibly jeopardizing their job).\n\nIt takes *two seconds* to say, \"Sorry to cut things off short, but OP has an early day tomorrow, so I've gotta scoot too.\"\n\nOP is NTA. He (hopefully now-ex-)BF IS. And he's a childish one at that.", "Admittedly, there\u2019s 1 or 2 people that I could\u2019ve talked to while waiting but my exhaustion was taking over my body and I had no motivation to make conversation lol", "Indeed.", "I had to go back to check the ages, because that was so wild to me.", "Let me tell you as someone who was in a similar position: it will never get better, and you\u2019ll be tired, grumpy, and \u2018a nag\u2019 who always kills the fun. \n\nI wish I\u2019d just driven home. NTA.", "You are NTA. \n\nBut this is one of those red flags that you should seriously consider leaving him, sooner than later. Him blocking you after gaslighting, and after treating you like that the whole night is horrible. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true.\n\nHe has no respect for you or your needs, no value other than what he can get out of you. Things will not get better. And if you talk about it and he apologizes, he may act better short term but this is one of those basic character flaws that won\u2019t go away, and will get worse the longer you\u2019re with him and the more comfortable he gets.", "I did something similar once... We went to some get together at my BFs mom's. I told my BF up front that I wanted to leave early (I was driving, so he could drink his beers). He kept chatting with all kinds of people, while I was getting a headache that required me going to bed with the lights off. I told him several times I needed to go, but he didn't want to leave yet.\n\nSo I decided to say bye to him, and leave. He argued with me and walked with me to the car, got in and I decided to drive off. He kept arguing, so at some point, right between our towns, I decided to stop the car and told him to get out. \n\nHe didn't want to, told me once more to turn around and go back, so I got out of the car. He did too, so I quickly got back in and locked the doors. I told him through an open window to just walk back to his mom (we were still closer to her town than ours), and then I drove off.\n\nThat was also the end of our relationship. Best decision I ever made. He promised so many things that he never did...\n\nETA: This incident took place in the middle of the day. Full daylight, and not in a dangerous place.", "Honestly, I don't understand why you waited even half as long as you did. You should have left him earlier. And you should see his behavior now, and understand that this is who he is, and ask yourself if this is the kind of man you really want in your life. (I think you deserve much better.)", "Are you the boyfriend? \ud83d\ude02", "He could still call his sister and find a ride! NTA", "Being a \"5 more minutes\" kind of person is a lot less negative than what you're trying to place onto him.", "No, but imagine getting broken up with because you're a social person who just wanted some more time to enjoy a party.\n\nImagine getting bugged every 5 minutes in the middle of a conversation to end the conversation. Would that make you more willing to end the conversation, or more defiant to keep it going? \n\nImagine getting left alone at a party because your girlfriend couldn't sacrifice one more hour for you.", "He wasn\u2019t \u201cleft alone.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t even interacting with her AND he had a guaranteed ride.\n\nBut you\u2019re right: he\u2019ll only continue to ignore her needs and their agreed-upon plans, because he\u2019ll always put his own pleasure and whims first.  And then he\u2019ll call her a nag.  He\u2019s a child.  She should block him herself and find someone who respects her."]}
