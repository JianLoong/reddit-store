He said yes, let me just finish my conversation, I said Ok.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of waiting, I tell him again that I was tired so we needed to leave. He told me to wait 5 more minutes.\n\nBut those 5 minutes quickly turned into 10, those 10 into 20 and 20 into 30 minutes.\n\nAt this point,I was getting angry because he already promised me we\u2019d leave early but it was now close to midnight and he was still talking. \n\nI go to him again and tell him that if he\u2019s having fun and wants to stay then I can ask his sister to drive him home as it\u2019s on her way. \nHe said no and that he was coming. I told him that i was really tired and would leave without him if he wasn\u2019t there in 5 minutes.  He said he\u2019d be there.\n\nIt\u2019s without surprise that after 5 minutes, he was still not here but was having another conversation with someone else. \n\nI go to him one last time and tell him I\u2019m leaving, I guess he didn\u2019t heard because he didn\u2019t react.\n\nBefore leaving, I go to his sister and ask if she can drives him home, she said she would so I thanked her and I left.\n\nMy boyfriend called me 10 minutes after to ask where I was. I told him I left because I was tired and he wouldn\u2019t leave. \nHe called me an AH and hung up. \n\nHe texted me right after and told me that I was an ah for leaving without him, that he was just talking with his friends and that it wouldn\u2019t have killed me to wait a little more. He blocked me right after that and slept at his sister\u2019s house.\n\nI texted her and she told me he just need time to cool down and that me leaving without him had really hurt him. \n\nNo news since, from him or his sister. \n\nWas I the AH to leave without him ?

He owes you an apology.", "1. You set a boundary. He ignored it several times  \n2. You made sure he had a lift home  \n3. It's not safe to drive when you're overly tired.

Why does his wants come before your needs? You made it clear before the party that you needed to leave early and he agreed, but decided something else in his head. He said that 'It wouldn't have killed you to wait a little more' meaning that he had no intention of wrapping up his convo in 5 minutes and planned to make you wait as long as he wanted. He had the right to want to speak with his friends, but why did he want to force you to stay when you were tired and his sister was there and could drive him?

You gave him a warning prior to going. You let him know when you wanted to go. You reminded him you wanted to go. You gave him a final countdown to when you were leaving. At this point I think most people would have left without him. Making people wait for you like that is a power trip. It basically is saying that your needs are less important.

NTA; let him wallow in his own self-pity.", "NTA.  You have a self-centered boyfriend", "No. You set a rule, he agreed to it, and you gave him many reminders and chances to leave. \n\nYou even took the time to find another driver.

You ended up giving him like a whole hour heads up, AND you arranged a seemingly suitable back up ride for him if he wanted to stay.  Even if you\u2019d made him take an uber home and pay for it himself frankly you still wouldn\u2019t be TA after how many times he pushed for 5 more minutes.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t get over this on his own and apologize for reacting this way he\u2019s *seriously* not worth it.", "Nope he fucked around and found out.  Gave planty of warnings after establishing a boundary.   NTA", "NTA. You warned him multiple times and gave im many opportunities to leave. He can dry his eyes.", "No...of course not.  Rather...he's the AH as he obviously doesn't respect you, the agreement the two of you had and be extension...your relationship.  Kick his ass to the curb...you can find 'worthless' anywhere.", "NTA.

We went to some get together at my BFs mom's. I told my BF up front that I wanted to leave early (I was driving, so he could drink his beers). He kept chatting with all kinds of people, while I was getting a headache that required me going to bed with the lights off. I told him several times I needed to go, but he didn't want to leave yet.\n\nSo I decided to say bye to him, and leave.

He kept arguing, so at some point, right between our towns, I decided to stop the car and told him to get out. \n\nHe didn't want to, told me once more to turn around and go back, so I got out of the car. He did too, so I quickly got back in and locked the doors. I told him through an open window to just walk back to his mom (we were still closer to her town than ours), and then I drove off.\n\nThat was also the end of our relationship.

When you're in the moment, it's incredibly common to keep thinking \"next time, he means it\".  And part of that is the reluctance to do something that feels drastic to you.  \n\nBut you were right to do what you did.  You gave him tons of chances.  You then gave him some very clear warnings.  You also made sure he'd have a ride home.  \n\nI know you're second-guessing yourself now, especially because he's being petulant and trying to guilt-trip you.  But you shouldn't feel guilty about it.\n\nYOU respected his repeated requests for just a little bit longer to socialize.  (His \"it wouldn't kill you to wait for 5 more minutes\" is hilarious -- you DID wait \"for 5 more minutes\", about 5 times in succession.)\n\nHE did not respect YOU at all.  He didn't respect that you had to work in the morning.  He didn't respect that you were getting tired, and had to drive.  On top of that?  He appears not even to be grateful to you for doing the driving because he can't.  (You know, when you break something and can't drive, you can get rides from other sometimes; but otherwise, you're just stuck and can't go.  You should never take friends or partners who taxi you around for granted.)\n\nThat's a pretty big imbalance there.  You gave him a bunch of second-chances.  He, in turn, gave you NOTHING -- except some extremely immature behavior on his part.\n\nI hope his sister can talk some sense into him.\n\nI do agree with others that unless something big changes \\*with him\\*, you're looking at a relationship in which you'll always be \"the nag\", dealing with a man who sulks and guilt-trips you.   That's not great!  \n\nWill he change?  Well, the only way he changes is if he admits that THIS TIME, he was completely in the wrong -- both in not listening to you about leaving, and in the way he reacted afterwards.  If he doesn't admit that?  He's not going to change.  \n\nYou can try to sit down with him and talk it over, and explain what you need from him.  But before doing that, you should really think about what it is you need.  What boundaries do you want to draw?  Boundaries are about what YOU will do, if something happens. You can't set a boundary by demanding that someone else do something different.  All you can do is tell them what you need, and tell them what you will do if your needs aren't met.\n\nSo, for example: \"When we both agree that we're going to leave early, because I have to get up early for work the next day, I need you to honor that promise.  If you don't, I will give you 10 minutes to say your goodbyes, and then I will leave on my own.  I will try to make sure you have a ride home, but you might need to be prepared to take an Uber.\"\n\nAnd: \"When I do what I said I would do from the outset -- that is, leave within 10 minutes of the time we agreed on, after giving you some warning that it's time -- I need for you not to act as if I have betrayed you.  I did what I said I would do, based on the agreement WE MADE TOGETHER.  It's not my fault, if YOU did not keep to the agreement, but I did what I said I would do.\"\n\nThe unspoken third thing, though, is: what YOU want to do, if he keeps doing this.  Not just keeps over-staying at parties, but, keeps pulling this guilt-tripping bullshit.  Because the only reasonable thing for you to do, if he keeps doing it, is telling him that you can no longer continue the relationship.  But of course, in order to set that boundary, you have to be willing to walk away.", "What happened to you is known as manipulation.

He'd agree but it never worked out that way. We would stay well past midnight, my brother and I would be literally falling asleep. He'd keep saying \"after this conversation, after this beer, etc.\" And it was always a lie to stay longer (and drink more).
