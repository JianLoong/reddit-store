(She's currently in court to get custody of the others and I welcome that for her,) for a little background for her she is a pathological lier and due to that I am the only family member in contact with her. She currently has no job, nor does her fiance, but relay on some of his family and me for money for things, but I've recently came to find out that most of the time when she has asked for money, she'll say \"hey, baby is sick and the medication is 40$\" (for conxet we live in Canada and health care for anyone under 25 is free) but then call me the next day and baby is fine. \n\nSo lately I would just lie and say no I'm broke, or something along those lines, but that still doesn't stop her from asking, so I said, \"look I'm not giving you anymore money till you pay me back, you always say and I have proof that you said you will pay me back,\". She hasn't texted me back, her fiance said I was an ass cause she doesn't have a job, I said she doesn't have a job cause she hasn't looked!! She sits on her ass on \"disability\" that she got by lieing to doctors.\n\nShe also has no idea that I'm pregnant, and I have no intention on ever telling her, not even when my children is born, this is because she will sware up and down that I called children aid on her, I have never done that, and she has once \"joked\" about calling children's aid on me if I ever had a child. SHE HAS DONE THIS SHIT TO MY PARENTS AND GRANDMOTHER WHO RAISED HER!  So that was an instant red flag to me. My boyfriend, and his family and mine agree with me but, I don't know?

Don't give her your address and change your phone number. Send her one final text or have one final conversation with her before you do.
