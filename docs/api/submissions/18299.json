It's one person for a couple hours, get over it.  The party was moved up to accommodate you and now you want to miss it because of one annoying person??  Definitely, 100% YTA.", "YWBTA, they moved it because of you. Try to get along with people.", "YTA. You haven't really provided much of a reason why she's so awful. Was she abusive? Did she lie/steal etc? You just said she was mentally draining which doesn't really imply that she's a bad person. \n\nAlso you infer that she shouldn't really be there cause she's an ex and in a new relationship. This isn't high school. People are allowed to be friends with an ex. This whole thing sounds so juvenile.", "YWBTA. He postponed the first time because of you so you\u2019re committed to the housewarming regardless of your feelings", "YWBTA. you're putting your annoyance of someone's presence over a meaningful friendship. you are all adults. this housewarming was even planned to accommodate your schedule, which is an obligation in of itself. i've also seen the comment saying you want to bring up not coming to future intimate events if she's there. you don't have to talk to her if she's there, and if she speaks to you, you're old enough to be polite and hold a conversation. she's still his friend, and obviously their friendship means something, ex or not.", "It\u2019s his housewarming and he can invite who he likes. You don\u2019t need to understand why he invited her. But if you want to be a good friend, especially when he\u2019s accommodated your schedule, you need to go and be cordial for a few hours. It won\u2019t kill you and it\u2019s part of being an adult. If not, YWBTA", "YTA You shouldn\u2019t have let him move the date if your presence was conditional on her attendance. It\u2019s not weird at all to invite an ex. It\u2019s irrelevant that she\u2019s engaged.", "YWBTA. Firstly because the date of the event was rearranged for your convenience. Secondly, because you don\u2019t get to select the guest list for someone else\u2019s party.  Thirdly, because the party is meant to celebrate your friend, not his ex. And lastly, because you don\u2019t get to pick your friend\u2019s friends.\n\nIf you don\u2019t enjoy the ex\u2019s company, you can strike up conversations with the other four and ignore her.", "YWBTA and I\u2019m not sure how you can\u2019t see that yourself", "YWBTA. It sounds like they really want you to be there (they moved the date for you). You are there to celebrate with them. Just don\u2019t engage with her too much.", "**YTA** or, to your question, yes you *would* be.\n\n>They moved the date for my convenience as I have an overseas trip.\n\nSo, there is no excuse for you to not attend (short of a true emergency). Full stop.\n\nWho cares if you (or anyone) don't like her, or that she is engaged?\n\nThe person throwing the party (ex or not) wants them there.\n\nYou're 29, not 13. Grow up.", "Does your friend really mean that little that you can't play nice with this other person for a few hours after they moved the whole event for you?\n\nYWBTA", "YWBTA. Simply ignore the ex. If she attempts to make conversation with you, make your answers closed. Don't ask her any questions. She'll move on to someone else.", "YTA. They moved the date for you. Part of being an adult is sometimes dealing with people we don\u2019t like. Your friend gets to invite who he wants and you can suck it up for a few hours.", "Since they rescheduled specifically for you to attend, you are obliged to go. YWBTA if you didn't. And aside from the ex, these are your friends, right?\n\nPut on your most civil and professional face, promise yourself to leave after an hour if it's unbearable, and just pretend the ex isn't there. You don't have to talk to her or acknowledge her. \n\nIf she tries to engage you in conversation, just keep excusing yourself. \"Hi, ex! Excuse me, I was just on my way to the bathroom.\" \"Nice of you to come, excuse me, I'm going to get another drink.\" \"Excuse me, I have to go say hello to Bill.\" Every time. It might be a little rude but so what, it's not like you're trying to preserve the relationship. As long as you're *polite* then nobody can say a thing.\n\nAnd again, stay an hour. If it's unbearable, take your leave. If it's going okay, stay longer. Focus on the hosts and give them your hearty congratulations. It's one evening and part of being a good friend. You can do it.", "YWBTA. Sorry, dude. As much of a fan I am for ditching events to avoid people you don't like, they purposely scheduled this so you could attend. So, if anything, take that as a compliment, like you are the guest of honor. Btw, you don't have to talk back to your ex. From the sounds of it, she could walk up, rant about something, and walk off without you ever saying a word.", "From the comments, I will be attending the housewarming. In future, how do I let my friend know that I don\u2019t want to attend intimate events if she is there.  I\u2019m ok if it\u2019s a big party.", "YWNBTA.\n\nIt's an invite. No one can force you to go if you don't want to.\n\nSure, it was nice of them to change the date of the party so that you could attend.\n\nOn the other hand, since you were fully 20% of the guest list, it makes sense that they would try to reschedule a date that worked for everyone.\n\nAt the time of the rescheduling, you were unaware that your friends ex would be in attendance. Since multiple guests have voiced their concerns over this one person, I suspect their attendance was deliberately not mentioned by your friend.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with just telling them straight up \"I do not like this person and do not want to spend my free time with them.\"\n\nI'd argue that's a better solution than forcing yourself to go, having to put up with this person, and potentially being blamed for \"ruining\" the party. \n\nIt'd be different if there were more people attending; you could just ignore them pretty easily. It being as intimate as it is, I would just tell them \"Sorry but I'm not going.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
