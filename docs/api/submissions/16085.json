Not even asking him not to pee in the shower *ever* just to pee before coming into the shower *with* you or shower and pee without you. That's the compromise. He doesn't get to have his way cuz he thinks you're overreacting - it's about basic respect.

I didn't. I tolerated it and dismissed it like I'm sure your hunny expects you to do.
