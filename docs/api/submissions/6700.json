I have never forced him to attend them. This has become a problem with my sister. My niece's best friend is in my son's class this year. She's one of the kids who has been far less than kind to him. But this girl also has a tough life per my sister and has had her own trouble with kids being mean to her. My sister was angry when the girls guardian told her that we had let her know our son would not be there. She told me it was teaching him a bad example by not getting him to go to every party he's invited to. I told her I never would parent him that way. She told me that you should always teach your kids to rise above and show kindness even when it might not be shown to you. I told her that's fine if she wants to do that but my son is already quiet and reserved and has trouble, I'm not going to destroy any self worth he has by forcing him to attend parties for kids who are mean to him and go out of their way to do so. I told her the girl in question has not been kind to my son and while I sympathize with her having a rough life, my son doesn't need to be there for her after everything.\n\nShe called me a bad parent. I told her that she doesn't get to judge me for making a different decision to her and I pointed out that our parents never forced us, and that if they had, she would be bitterly resentful today seeing as she still hates a number of the people from her class.

Your son is not her child, not her concern.  And I don\u2019t care what anyone says, I would never make my children go to something they did not want to, especially a child that bullied them.  I can\u2019t even imagine getting a gift for said person.  And if this child bullied your child, does that child even want your child at their party?  What?  So that your child can be bullied even more?  What in the world is your sister thinking?  I actually feel sorry for her child.", "NTA.  You\u2019re not failing as a parent at all, SHE is, if she\u2019s forcing her children to go to every party whether they want to or not.  \u201cRising above\u201d is for situations you can\u2019t get out of - school, work, unexpected encounter in the grocery store or other public place.  But forcing children to interact with their abusers in social situations only breeds resentment, anger and lack of trust in the parent doing the forcing.  I\u2019m old(ish) - I still have anger at my mother for doing that to me, and I never did it to my child.  Trust me, OP - you are in the right here.", "Wonder why the issue was so incredibly important to your sister?", "Your sister is a total asshole here", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s been conditioned since she was a kid to ask for seconds when people are serving humble pie.", "[removed]", "Its funeral was held the day the internet turned on.", "I understand the school rule since being singled out by not getting invited can be traumatic. But in no way does that obligate kids to attend. \n\n/u/Fine-Sell-6321/, does your son have any interests that might encourage him to be a little more social?  For example, if he likes to read, does the library sponsor any special events in which he could participate? Or maybe a museum or park with kids activities?\n\nOr what about volunteer activities for families, like helping with a food or toy drive? Or if he is interested in the environment, a stream clean up or a recycling drive.

Yes, as an adult, I have to do a lot of things I don't like, such as attend a work meeting that could have been an email, or sit in my doctor's waiting room for two hours when I arrived on time for my appointment.

You're doing the right thing as a parent and your sisters argument is ludicrous to me. I was also a quiet child, and was forced into a couple of events that I didn't want to attend because \"it would be good for me\".

Why should your son be forced to go to a party of someone he doesn't like?? That's ridiculous! Rise above and show kindness? That literally has nothing to do with this at all.

So tired of that bullshiet line.", "NTA making him go and BUYING A GIFT for a kid who has been mean to him is not teaching him anything but that it's ok for people to treat him like that.

How a bout a look in the mirror, forcing your child to accept bullies and bend over for others no matter what. I am worried for her own child, about how she is being raised and with what kind of friends... Also your sister forcing YOU to do something, a grownup, sounds very narcissistic, not everything in the world goes according to her wants. Next time just laugh at her and end the conversation.

Especially when you add in things like telling them to \"rise above\" the bullying (which in this case equates to \"suck it up\" in slightly kinder phrasing). In my opinion, this is an extension of bodily autonomy, if you teach this to an 8 year old, what happens when they're 18 and off on their own and ends up in situations with potentially higher stakes consequences (drugs, sexual assault, DUI)?", "She also needs to worry about her own parenting when she allows her daughter to be best friends with a bully.", "He doesn't want to go that's all that matters.", "NTA.

My high school \"best friend\" was a bully and I was often her target. Of course she presented so many things as \"a joke\" and \"just having fun!\".
