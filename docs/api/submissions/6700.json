He's had some trouble with a few of the kids in school being mean to him, excluding him, etc. I actually had regular contact with the last two teachers because of this. They would run into a problem with other kids being mean and because he's so quiet and doesn't speak up a lot they wanted me to know. He does have a friend and the two of them have the sweetest little friendship. But he's not really close to anyone else in his class and there are kids he's afraid of.\n\nIn saying that, the school has the rule that all kids in the class must be invited if party invites are handed out inside school. I have never forced him to attend them. This has become a problem with my sister. My niece's best friend is in my son's class this year. She's one of the kids who has been far less than kind to him. But this girl also has a tough life per my sister and has had her own trouble with kids being mean to her. My sister was angry when the girls guardian told her that we had let her know our son would not be there. She told me it was teaching him a bad example by not getting him to go to every party he's invited to. I told her I never would parent him that way. She told me that you should always teach your kids to rise above and show kindness even when it might not be shown to you. I told her that's fine if she wants to do that but my son is already quiet and reserved and has trouble, I'm not going to destroy any self worth he has by forcing him to attend parties for kids who are mean to him and go out of their way to do so. I told her the girl in question has not been kind to my son and while I sympathize with her having a rough life, my son doesn't need to be there for her after everything.\n\nShe called me a bad parent. I told her that she doesn't get to judge me for making a different decision to her and I pointed out that our parents never forced us, and that if they had, she would be bitterly resentful today seeing as she still hates a number of the people from her class. She told me I was failing as a parent and she called me an asshole for being cold and not seeing her side.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673078951, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105jpob/aita_for_telling_my_sister_my_son_does_not_have/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like the idea of \"everyone is included or nobody is included\" is fine for establishing relationships early on,  so maybe the first two years of school.  After that,  invite your kid's real friends.  Give school friends the invites outside of school if you don't want to fall foul off the rules. Potentially traumatising your kid with the goal to teach them that healthy boundaries are fine until social obligation means you're not allowed to have them?  That's toxic bullshit.", "Second comment, but it's also ironic that she is calling you an asshole for not being \"kind.\"\n\nWell that's not very kind, either!", "Nta.

You can't force someone to be kind. That's not genuine kindness, that's just keeping up appearances.\n\n2. Since when is going to someone's party an act of *kindness*? I'd argue that inviting someone is the kind part, and these kids didn't have the option to not do so. Again, going seems to be more about appearances.\n\nNTA.

Aside from prison and the army, there are NO situations in the adult world that you are not allowed to remove yourself from if you don\u2019t want to be there, especially not something as frivolous as a party.

No. \n\nMost people I know who have it rough are appreciative of those who support them, but understand why others may keep their distance. And that's without misbehavior on the part of the person having a hard time.\n\nYour sister is overstepping. And it's fair to ensure she understands criticizing your parenting in that way is a boundary. Your son is not a sacrificial lamb. His emotional well-being is not to be ignored in order to serve the needs of someone else. Someone who doesn't treat him well. \n\nTruth is, if the child's life is that hard, it's up to the adults to get creative and find ways of supporting her and/or her family.

What it sounds like to me, is that she's telling you that if your son doesn't go to this girl's party, then they will never be friends, and their relationship will never mend.
