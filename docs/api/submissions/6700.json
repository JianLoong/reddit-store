I have never forced him to attend them. This has become a problem with my sister. My niece's best friend is in my son's class this year. She's one of the kids who has been far less than kind to him. But this girl also has a tough life per my sister and has had her own trouble with kids being mean to her. My sister was angry when the girls guardian told her that we had let her know our son would not be there. She told me it was teaching him a bad example by not getting him to go to every party he's invited to. I told her I never would parent him that way. She told me that you should always teach your kids to rise above and show kindness even when it might not be shown to you. I told her that's fine if she wants to do that but my son is already quiet and reserved and has trouble, I'm not going to destroy any self worth he has by forcing him to attend parties for kids who are mean to him and go out of their way to do so. I told her the girl in question has not been kind to my son and while I sympathize with her having a rough life, my son doesn't need to be there for her after everything.\n\nShe called me a bad parent. I told her that she doesn't get to judge me for making a different decision to her and I pointed out that our parents never forced us, and that if they had, she would be bitterly resentful today seeing as she still hates a number of the people from her class.

For example, if he likes to read, does the library sponsor any special events in which he could participate? Or maybe a museum or park with kids activities?\n\nOr what about volunteer activities for families, like helping with a food or toy drive?

In my opinion, this is an extension of bodily autonomy, if you teach this to an 8 year old, what happens when they're 18 and off on their own and ends up in situations with potentially higher stakes consequences (drugs, sexual assault, DUI)?", "She also needs to worry about her own parenting when she allows her daughter to be best friends with a bully.", "He doesn't want to go that's all that matters.", "NTA.

It is taking everything I have to unlearn it. You're prioritising your child, which is commendable. Not attending is not being unkind.

You are nowhere near TA and she is overstepping and behaving very strangely. You sound like a great parent.", "NTA. But in fact a very good and supportive parent. A good parent would not force their child to go to a party where they are not wanted except for some possible bully entertainment at the child\u2019s expense.

Way to squash someone's self-esteem, so they're being mean to you so you go and let them?\n\nEdit:spelling", "And OP isn't responding to the RSVP with \"my son won't be attending because your child SUCKS\", just that their son won't be there. As far as the other parents know, the family could have plans for that day, someone in the family could be sick and they don't want to spread it around, the kid could be allergic to their party favors and it is easier to not go, they don't have child care for other kids in the household, or the kid doesn't want to go. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with politely declining to attend an event.", "EXACTLY!
