You did nothing wrong. Those colleagues who say that you should ignore him should be harassed by him. Bunch of assholes.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is actually exactly why he should be fired. \n\n- Harassment\n- Creating a hostile work environment\n- inappropriate behavior\n\nYou did the exact right thing. HR took the decision to fire him, not you. You go to work to work, not be harangued by a self-righteous nutjob.", "NTA. \n\nYou were being seriously harassed. You did the right thing.", "NTA he highly deserved to lose his job.", "NTA.  One complaint does not usually lead to a firing.  This might have been the last straw, especially if he was on a PIP.  And if an investigation showed he has a bad habit of attacking people for spiritual beliefs, he\u2019s got to go.  There\u2019s a big difference in wearing a cross or Star of David or hijab and actively going after someone else, insulting and threatening them.\n\nHR\u2019s job is to protect the company and once he threatened to SA you, they knew you could sue the company if they did nothing.  So they solved the problem.  This was not on you.  This was HR taking care of the company.  And if anyone else harasses you, look up \u201cretaliation\u201d.  Cause that\u2019s a very big no no to HR and an even bigger lawsuit risk.", "His comments were wild and no one should act like that in a work space. Especially the SA comment! He crossed a line and now he had to face the consequences.", "NTA, he was harassing you without any reason... though more info would be useful.", "Nope. If a coworker says \"If I SA'd you...\" to anyone else, regardless of the context, that's it. That's a fireable offense by itself. NTA", "NTA. It was hostile work environment discrimination based on your religion and sex. Yes he deserved to lose his job, and you should report your co-workers as well.", "NTA. He absolutely DID deserve to get fired. Anyone who disagrees with you at work should be someone you look out for and stay away from.", "NTA - apparently HR felt he should have been terminated.", "NTA\n\n> I\u2019ve also had one coworker (white) call me racist\n\n\"Should we go together and talk to HR about this right now?\"", "Seriously? This is even a question? So NTA. That guy is an HR nightmare and basically unemployable if he can't shut up.\n\nIt's not cool when Christians act that way towards non-Christians, nor is it cool for a non-Christian to harass a Christian when they're minding their own business.", "There are a lot of bad Christians, but that\u2019s not an excuse to treat them all badly without first seeing their  actions, and behaviours. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, people need to mind their own business.", "NTA\n\nDude has no idea what modern Christianity involves and even if he did, his comments were not just offensive but also a little threatening. \n\nYou tried ignoring him but he kept badgering. It's a classic case of FAFO.", "Nta it wasn\u2019t your decision to fire him and it 100% seems like others had a problem with his behavior as only one person\u2019s account wouldn\u2019t make him fired straight away. Your coworkers are shitty thinking you should\u2019ve put up with that", "NTA \n\nAdults should know this behavior isn\u2019t appropriate in the workplace and learn the hard way when necessary.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling guilty, you should have first asked him to stop.", "NTA\n\nSo the guy suggested he could SA you so he could marry you, and your coworkers thought you should have not said anything? You aren't the asshole, but they are.", "Nta, good job, kid, standing up for yourself and other Christians who love what they love.", "WTF?  He damn near threatened to rape you!\n\n> At one point he told me that if he SA\u2019d me then I couldn\u2019t do anything about it other than marry him because of \u201cmy religion\u201d.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He got himself fired.", "NTA\n\nBe aware that your work is also obliged to prevent retaliation. Keep a record of people bothering you about this.", "NTA.  Good on you for helping eliminate bigotry in the workplace  :)", "NTA, he definitely crossed a huge line when when he mentioned you'd have no recourse after SA besides marrying him. You gave him the chance to stop by ignoring him and he turned up the heat. You didn't get him fired, he did that to himself.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s done this to others or something similar not just because he was fired, but bye cause he thought it was perfectly okay to treat someone like this.\n\nReporting him was the right thing to do. Never tolerate bullying.", "NTA.\n\nHe was bullying you for your religion. You did what was in company policy and reported him. You are not being paid, nor responsible for listening to all those attacks on you.  \n\n\nObviously a lot more people had issues with that guy since company wouldn't fire the guy over this one incident besides he has himself to blame because he couldn't respect your beliefs.", "NTA. You had to report your co-worker on the point where things were getting so bad. He created a hostile work environment for all involved.", "NTA. You didn't get him fired. He got himself fired with his crappy behaviour.", "NTA", "NTA. I work in an environment that a lot of things go unreported because that is the nature of our work, commercial construction. But, threats of SA is something that will get you beat, quickly.", "NTA - He 100% deserved to be fired, especially considering it was more than once. He could've kept his opinions and biases to himself, but instead he decided to harras you multiple times.", "NTA\n\nVery creepy that he would hypothesize assaulting you under the guise of a religious debate. He was wildly over the line for appropriate workplace conduct.", "NTA\n\n \n\n>a few of my coworkers have said I should have just ignored him\n\n Ask them if they are willing to marry him after he SA them", "NTA.", "NTA.  and you did try to ignore them, and it didn't work.   those co-workers that are saying you were in the wrong perhaps were not bearing the brunt of this former co-worker's bad behaviour, so they didn't understand the situation.  or perhaps they hold similar ideals as that fired co-worker, yet aren't as nasty as to outright show it?", "NTA and fuck the coworkers who say he didn\u2019t deserve to lose his job. He was literally harassing you and crossed so many lines.", "NTA. Come on, really, bullying is still religious harassment and harassment is still prohibited, even if it doesn't meet whatever definition of \"discrimination\" people make up in their heads. Which isn't relevant anyway, if you're in America, since there's legal precedent and statutes that define it. Your coworkers aren't lawyers, that's not their job to determine what discrimination is.\n\nThe premise is absurd anyway. People who are non-white don't get a free pass to be bigots. People also don't get a free pass to be bigots to white people.", "NTA. He was seriously harassing you for awhile and you went to HR to get it to stop. Others must have been getting bothered by this person because I think they give warnings first and your complaint was the final straw.", "NTA...You have the right to feel safe in your workspace. Your employer has an obligation to provide you a secure workspace to ply your trade. He was seriously out of line. He is 100% responsible for his own fate. You did the right thing. Some of your coworkers may maintain an outside-work line of contact with this loser, which is why your catching static for it. Ignore them. If they get outta line: HR them too.", "NTA \n\nWhat an odd man, bye Felicia.", "You're describing completely unprofessional workplace behavior. You handled in textbook fashion.
