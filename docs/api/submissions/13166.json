It's not a dietary choice I'd choose to make, but it's medically necessary. \n\nI live with my husband (32M) and I do all the grocery shopping and cooking (he does an equal share of chores). Since my diagnosis I have adapted all our meals to be gluten free. Although gluten free food is a lot more expensive, it's easier to cook one meal for both of us rather than two seperate meals. Some of the gluten free alternatives are (subjectively) not as nice as the \"regular\" version. For example dried pasta and ready rolled pastry. Others don't make a difference, like stock cubes, GF saussages etc. \n\nMy husband has recently started complaining that my food isn't as good as it used to be and he wants me to make the \"normal\" versions again. For example, if I made a pasta sauce, he would want me to cook both regular and GF pasta or if I made a steak pie, he'd want me to make two (smaller) pies. I said I wouldn't be able to do this as already I spend a lot of time cooking. I said I would happily continue to buy him \"normal\" foods, and if he wanted to cook the regular versions, I would make enough sauce/filling and he could finish the rest. \n\nThis led to an argument, where he called me selfish and said I was punishing him for my diagnosis. I have always done the cooking, and he said that he should still be able to eat the food that he likes. He said that he does more general housework because I do the cooking, and by asking him to cook his own food (even if it was just the pasta) would mean that our pre-agreed spilt of housework was no longer fair. I argued that it was fair, as I was still doing all the shopping and cooking. \n\nAITA for not cooking two meals and only cooking gluten free food? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Even after my diagnosis I continued to (and will continue to) buy him most of the regular food that he ate and we didn't/couldn't share, like bread, cereal, frozen pizza etc. I also buy him little treats, like small cakes/baked items and confectionary that I can't eat anymore.

I only cook gluten free and even my friends are cool with me cooking GF for for holiday parties. in fact, we all make sure that we all can enjoy. I remember a while ago, we had a nut free, gluten free, dairy free, and vegan party because there was at least 1 person in the group that needed it. the food was amazing. its just a matter of learning to cook in a new way. \n\nstraight up, if you want, hit me up and I can help you with the GF living. I have dozens of recipes, tips and tricks, and suggestions that can help you.", "You're NTA. While it would be easy to boil a separate pot of water for pasta on nights you're having a pasta dish, you should not be expected to make two completely separate meals every night. He can either suck it up, or help cook. Waving the \"I do housework flag\" if all the other chores are split is childish and irrelevant.

As he does the majority of cooking, I am just happy to eat whatever he makes.\n\nWhen it comes to pasta, though, we do have it separately as GF pasta is very expensive.  It's much cheaper to use 'normal' pasta for me and the kids and save the GF just for him.\n\nAnything else (gravy, stock cubes, flour, etc) we just use the GF version to make everyone's life easier.  Plus, the consequences of him accidentally eating gluten are not pleasant as I'm sure you can agree.", "NTA, you should cook for you, you are the one that goes through pain and discomfort if you don\u2019t. If he doesn\u2019t like the food at all, I understand that, but then he should cook his own. \n\n\nAs for the share of chores, this is a bit more tricky, but I don\u2019t think laundry, for example, takes as much time and effort as cooking and shopping. \n\n\nIf he would have to now cook a significant amount of his meals, perhaps add one or two chores to your side of things, but other than that, no.", "NTA, you got a life changing diagnosis and he\u2019s being the selfish one.", "NTA  \nHaving to go gluten free is a HUGE adjustment for you.   It sounds like you have made suggestions for compromises and he's throwing a fit.", "NTA. I have no idea how people are giving \"ESH\". You have an illness you didn't ask for and it's not an easy thing to cook two versions of a meal. Your partner needs to adjust and support you. Maybe this means a new conversation around labour divisions sure, but it doesn't make you the asshole.\n\nMarriage is for better or worse, in sickness and in death. Man needs to grow up about it. Alternatively, tell him to alternate cooking and he can cook for himself and for you - why should it always be you who does it?", "NTA, but it sounds like it's time to redistribute the chores so that you are either freed up to cook separate meals or he is the one freed up to cook his own. Would need to be careful that the chores end up being evenly redistributed.", "NTA\n\nYou're the cook, you make the food, that's what's being served. I'm the cook in my previous and current household, and as much as I love to cook, I don't wanna do it every day, let alone twice almost every weeknight.

This is a huge life adjustment for you, one that could make you very sick if you were to accidentally cross-contaminate while cooking two separate meals at the same time. Not to mention that it's a lot of extra dishes and extra work to cook two meals at once, especially since there would be extensive cross contamination issues - you can't even use the same utensils or surfaces when cooking for gluten free! Your health is more important than his taste buds.", "NTA. It sounds like you two have a great balance of chores and you are doing your best to make sure that your husband still gets to enjoy the food he likes, while also taking care of your medical needs. It's understandable that he feels like he needs to get something out of the deal too. Maybe you could suggest a compromise where you can both get what you need. For example, you could make a gluten free version of a dish and he could make a regular version. That way you both get to eat what you like and you get to share the cooking load.", "NTA - I cook two dinners because my oldest son has sensory issues.

Our current situation is a good middle ground so far. If I want something she can't have, it's only reasonable that I prepare that myself.\n\nI don't find this to be unreasonable because it's my wife's health at stake, and that's the most important thing.\n\nWe've encountered many people who don't seem to understand how serious coeliac is and don't feel a certain level of care or effort is necessary. It sounds a bit like your husband has the same mindset.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NTA the chance of contamination is high I can\u2019t even imagine keeping glutinous products in the kitchen at all besides prepackaged goods that can be eaten directly from the package.

He needs to grow up. If he doesn't like the gluten-free version and you still are doing the majority of the prep do he can fix his own. You have fulfilled your part.\n\nOn a side note, check out lectin free. Some controversy but gluten is a lectin also. I'm personally lowering my lectin exposure, and the IBS I struggle with is finally under control.", "I'd be so beyond angry if my husband acted like this. I can't currently have milk because our daughter has a sensitivity and I'm nursing. So I stopped buying a number of things that were normal for us, like a weekly grocery store pizza. We both acknowledge that it sucks, but I do the shopping and most of the cooking. If there's something my husband wants that I can't have, he makes or modifies it himself, just like what you suggested. It's not hard. He can either suck it up and be fine with things how they are, or he can start putting forth more effort to change things the way he wants. NTA", "NTA. Celiac isn't a dietary preference, it's your health.\n\nIf you're like my wife, it's not just the ingredients that need to be gluten free, but also the pots, pans, knives, serving utensils, and prep surfaces that need to be gluten free. Keeping those all separated in a single kitchen is challenging, unless you want dedicated gluten-free cookware and dedicated gluten cookware with matching gluten-free and gluten sponges. \n\nGluten will stick to anything porous - so it'll stick to wooden/plastic cutting boards, sponges, non-stick pans, pretty much anything besides metal, glass, ceramics, and porcelain. For my wife and I, it's not worth her getting sick due to some cross contamination. We have dedicated gluten pots and pans that we keep separate with a dedicated gluten sponge, but we rarely use them and when we do we are very careful to keep them separate.\n\nPart of it is finding the right gluten-free products. For dry pastas, gluten-free products from Italy actually do a good job on being gluten-free and being tasty. My wife and I found a dry pasta that we really liked that you couldn't tell the difference. I forget the brand, but I think it's called 'le veneziane.' Same thing for other types of products, sometimes it takes a while to find one that you really like that works. \n\nIt can be tough to find good gluten-free products, but I think it's probably tougher to maintain a mixed gluten-free and gluten kitchen. If you would like any recommendations for types of products, let me know and I'll ask my wife. When I saw and learned how much it affected my wife's health, I was more than willing to keep our kitchen and cooking as gluten-free as possible. I hope you're able to find something that works for your health and your situation.", "NTA and as someone who thought they had a gluten intolerance, in this day and age, most gluten free alternatives are delicious.", "Wow. Massive NTA. I simply can't stand the type of person who thinks for some reason that someone else is obliged to cook for them or cook what they want. He needs to either learn to cook for himself, buy ready meals or get takeaway. Btw if he does any of those you shouldn't be upset, it's ok for him to not like GF food.

If he's doing more of the chores to offset you cooking then yes, he should be able to have the gluten equivalent of the items he's stated that he does not want to eat the gf equivalent.\n\nI cannot really see how making two lots of pastry is such a big deal, as long as you make your first to avoid cross contamination. Certainly if such an issue, surely batch cooking is the solution?", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. I'll bet if you made one or two \"reg meals\" (which could be as small as 2 pots of water for pasta but also could be a bit more work like the steak pies) a week or just put in any amount of effort the make something he likes, he'd be fine with the GF meals. If he insists every meal had a GF option, then I'd change my stance and recommend renegotiating chores. Just seems like you're not willing to make any effort to accommodate him at all.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nI honestly don't think cooking both pastas take that long. I have one family member who loves angel hair pasta and the rest of us like a thicker pasta like spaghetti, rigatoni or something similar.

Making 2 smaller pies wouldn't take you longer than 5-10 minutes. \n\nHave your husband come into the kitchen and help you a little bit. Teach him!

You didn't ask your body to do this to you and you are not punishing him for cooking to keep yourself healthy and alive.\n\nYou have enough to deal with without having to cook two meals because your husband has decided he can't or won't (hint- it's won't) adapt to a new way of eating. There is no reason in the world you should be cooking separate meals for the two of you. If learning to live with a gluten-free diet is too heavy a lift for him then he can prepare his own meals.

To do anything else is borderline malicious when it's a legit medical issue!\n\nNTA also a pro tip, using deb potato as a binding agent in meatballs etc works super well  \ud83d\ude09", "NTA - plus, cooking with gluten items can cross contaminate your gluten free ingredients and cause your GI tract unhappiness.

Make one meal and if he\u2019s not hungry he can make a pb&j or go to bed hungry.", "Not to mention cooking two meals could lead to accidental cross contamination. I even have a special toaster for my celiac bestie and I cook GF for us all when she is here.", "Hopping on to add, I am also celiac, been diagnosed for over 10 years now.  My gut is extremely sensitive to any sort of cross contamination.  I was diagnosed as a young adult still living at home with my parents and they still ate regular meals while mine had to be done separate.  I have been in the position of having to cook 2 (sometimes 3) separate meals a night and it is exhausting.  Also, you can\u2019t cook them at the same time without risking cross contamination which means either yours gets made first and it\u2019s cold by the time you get to eat it or yours gets made last and everyone is finished by the time you get to eat.  Quite honestly, your husbands priority\u2019s are messed up, he should be more concerned about you staying healthy than having his precious gluten.  My husband loves bread but he loves me more and happily eats what I eat because my safety is more important to him.  You are most definitely NTA and your husband needs to stop being selfish.  He\u2019s a big boy and can make his own food if he has a problem with yours. \n\nAlso, some tips from one celiac to another.  Gluten can linger on old dishes even after washing them (particularly cookie sheets I\u2019ve found) so you\u2019ll want to be careful about what you cook/bake on your normal cookware.  I have separate cookware at my parents home and my in-laws.  Cross contamination is super serious, even a crumb can set me off.  But for some people, they don\u2019t have obvious symptoms and then it can build up to more damage to your intestines.  \n\nWhen eating out, I always make sure to tell my server I have a gluten allergy, they will use special protocol for making your food to prevent as much cross contamination as possible.  However, you always want to do your research on a restaurant before going.  Some places are better than others about allergy protocols and some foods have gluten that you wouldn\u2019t expect.  Always verify that something\u2019s gluten free before ordering it as well.  Most servers are not familiar with celiac or what gluten is, let alone what menu items would be safe. \n\nExperiment with different brands of food.  Some brands are better than others, particularly with pasta.  My favorite pasta brand is Barilla, they have a pretty good variety, it cooks up well, and it also reheats really well too.  I\u2019d also look at different grocery stores to see what they have available.  Health food and organic stores will probably have more variety and options than chain ones do and it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll need to grocery shop at multiple places to get what you need.  It sucks but it\u2019s worth it when you can have more variety in your life. \n\nOh, and don\u2019t let your husband kiss you without either brushing his teeth + using mouthwash or waiting at least an hour if he eats gluten. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have other questions.

These attacks lead to damage on the villi, small fingerlike projections that line the small intestine, that promote nutrient absorption. When the villi get damaged, nutrients cannot be absorbed properly into the body.\n\nLong-Term Health Effects\nPeople with celiac disease have a 2x greater risk of developing coronary artery disease, and a **4x greater risk of developing small bowel cancers.**\n\n**Untreated celiac disease can lead to the development of other autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis (MS), and many other conditions, including dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy skin rash), anemia, osteoporosis, infertility and miscarriage, neurological conditions like epilepsy and migraines, short stature, heart disease, and intestinal cancers.**\n\nTreatment\nCurrently, the only treatment for celiac disease is lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet. People living gluten-free must avoid foods with wheat, rye, and barley, such as bread and beer.\n\n**Ingesting small amounts of gluten, like crumbs from a cutting board or toaster, can trigger small intestine damage.**' -sourced from celiac.org.\n\nLiterally a breadcrumb is sufficient to trigger immune response in people with celiac disease.

I honestly go to the Chinese stores in town and use my phone to translate if the ingredients are not in English.\n\nI will admit I don\u2019t cook Chinese-American food a lot because it\u2019s fairly gluten based in my experience. I don\u2019t have enough Chinese cuisine experience/knowledge so I haven\u2019t attempted it yet. It\u2019s why I specified the other cuisines and I realized I should have added Filipino cuisine to the list I made (adobo and lech\u00f3n is amazing! They also have something called boodle fight which looks easily gluten free and I really want to try it!)\n\nAn alternative for the soya sauce is Kikoman\u2019s gluten free soya sauce, or brags liquid aminos (I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called). I also have a lot of access to gluten free tamari soya sauces also. I go for kikomans if it\u2019s in the big bottle, but whatever is gluten free and on sale otherwise.

Pasta is important to my partner, so he took time discovering exactly which GF brand tasted perfect. We both love dumplings, so we experimented with flour to make them the perfect texture GF. \n\nWe give and take and experiment together. It\u2019s reasonable for him to want to order in a treat. It wouldn\u2019t be reasonable for him to ask me to contaminate our kitchen cooking with flour that harms me and our kid. Contamination is a real and serious concern.
