Since my diagnosis I have adapted all our meals to be gluten free. Although gluten free food is a lot more expensive, it's easier to cook one meal for both of us rather than two seperate meals. Some of the gluten free alternatives are (subjectively) not as nice as the \"regular\" version. For example dried pasta and ready rolled pastry. Others don't make a difference, like stock cubes, GF saussages etc. \n\nMy husband has recently started complaining that my food isn't as good as it used to be and he wants me to make the \"normal\" versions again. For example, if I made a pasta sauce, he would want me to cook both regular and GF pasta or if I made a steak pie, he'd want me to make two (smaller) pies. I said I wouldn't be able to do this as already I spend a lot of time cooking. I said I would happily continue to buy him \"normal\" foods, and if he wanted to cook the regular versions, I would make enough sauce/filling and he could finish the rest. \n\nThis led to an argument, where he called me selfish and said I was punishing him for my diagnosis. I have always done the cooking, and he said that he should still be able to eat the food that he likes. He said that he does more general housework because I do the cooking, and by asking him to cook his own food (even if it was just the pasta) would mean that our pre-agreed spilt of housework was no longer fair.

I only cook gluten free and even my friends are cool with me cooking GF for for holiday parties. in fact, we all make sure that we all can enjoy. I remember a while ago, we had a nut free, gluten free, dairy free, and vegan party because there was at least 1 person in the group that needed it. the food was amazing. its just a matter of learning to cook in a new way. \n\nstraight up, if you want, hit me up and I can help you with the GF living. I have dozens of recipes, tips and tricks, and suggestions that can help you.", "You're NTA. While it would be easy to boil a separate pot of water for pasta on nights you're having a pasta dish, you should not be expected to make two completely separate meals every night. He can either suck it up, or help cook. Waving the \"I do housework flag\" if all the other chores are split is childish and irrelevant.

It would be so hard to prevent cross-contamination for you when you're cooking both things at once. Just one mistake with a spoon could do it and you'd be glutened.", "NTA You\u2019re Celiac. This isn\u2019t a small thing, and there are good arguments to be made that you shouldn\u2019t even handle glutinous food.\n\nConsider making meals that were never intended to be gluten-based. There\u2019s maybe only one brand of GF pasta that\u2019s remotely good,   and only one brand of bread. I can\u2019t imagine that the replacement pastry doesn\u2019t taste like paste.

That he calls you selfish for not catering to him is fairly ironic.", "NTA.  My husband also has coeliacs.  As he does the majority of cooking, I am just happy to eat whatever he makes.\n\nWhen it comes to pasta, though, we do have it separately as GF pasta is very expensive.  It's much cheaper to use 'normal' pasta for me and the kids and save the GF just for him.\n\nAnything else (gravy, stock cubes, flour, etc) we just use the GF version to make everyone's life easier.  Plus, the consequences of him accidentally eating gluten are not pleasant as I'm sure you can agree.", "NTA, you should cook for you, you are the one that goes through pain and discomfort if you don\u2019t. If he doesn\u2019t like the food at all, I understand that, but then he should cook his own. \n\n\nAs for the share of chores, this is a bit more tricky, but I don\u2019t think laundry, for example, takes as much time and effort as cooking and shopping. \n\n\nIf he would have to now cook a significant amount of his meals, perhaps add one or two chores to your side of things, but other than that, no.", "NTA, you got a life changing diagnosis and he\u2019s being the selfish one.", "NTA  \nHaving to go gluten free is a HUGE adjustment for you.   It sounds like you have made suggestions for compromises and he's throwing a fit.", "NTA. I have no idea how people are giving \"ESH\". You have an illness you didn't ask for and it's not an easy thing to cook two versions of a meal. Your partner needs to adjust and support you. Maybe this means a new conversation around labour divisions sure, but it doesn't make you the asshole.\n\nMarriage is for better or worse, in sickness and in death. Man needs to grow up about it. Alternatively, tell him to alternate cooking and he can cook for himself and for you - why should it always be you who does it?", "NTA, but it sounds like it's time to redistribute the chores so that you are either freed up to cook separate meals or he is the one freed up to cook his own. Would need to be careful that the chores end up being evenly redistributed.", "NTA\n\nYou're the cook, you make the food, that's what's being served. I'm the cook in my previous and current household, and as much as I love to cook, I don't wanna do it every day, let alone twice almost every weeknight.

This is a huge life adjustment for you, one that could make you very sick if you were to accidentally cross-contaminate while cooking two separate meals at the same time. Not to mention that it's a lot of extra dishes and extra work to cook two meals at once, especially since there would be extensive cross contamination issues - you can't even use the same utensils or surfaces when cooking for gluten free! Your health is more important than his taste buds.", "NTA. It sounds like you two have a great balance of chores and you are doing your best to make sure that your husband still gets to enjoy the food he likes, while also taking care of your medical needs. It's understandable that he feels like he needs to get something out of the deal too. Maybe you could suggest a compromise where you can both get what you need. For example, you could make a gluten free version of a dish and he could make a regular version. That way you both get to eat what you like and you get to share the cooking load.", "NTA - I cook two dinners because my oldest son has sensory issues.

I just want to share that my dad has celiac and my mom actually got a second toaster oven and it\u2019s helped immensely. We also have a few dedicated gluten pots/pans and that\u2019s also helped.

Our current situation is a good middle ground so far. If I want something she can't have, it's only reasonable that I prepare that myself.\n\nI don't find this to be unreasonable because it's my wife's health at stake, and that's the most important thing.\n\nWe've encountered many people who don't seem to understand how serious coeliac is and don't feel a certain level of care or effort is necessary. It sounds a bit like your husband has the same mindset.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NTA the chance of contamination is high I can\u2019t even imagine keeping glutinous products in the kitchen at all besides prepackaged goods that can be eaten directly from the package.

He needs to grow up. If he doesn't like the gluten-free version and you still are doing the majority of the prep do he can fix his own. You have fulfilled your part.\n\nOn a side note, check out lectin free. Some controversy but gluten is a lectin also. I'm personally lowering my lectin exposure, and the IBS I struggle with is finally under control.", "I'd be so beyond angry if my husband acted like this. I can't currently have milk because our daughter has a sensitivity and I'm nursing. So I stopped buying a number of things that were normal for us, like a weekly grocery store pizza. We both acknowledge that it sucks, but I do the shopping and most of the cooking. If there's something my husband wants that I can't have, he makes or modifies it himself, just like what you suggested. It's not hard. He can either suck it up and be fine with things how they are, or he can start putting forth more effort to change things the way he wants. NTA", "NTA. Celiac isn't a dietary preference, it's your health.\n\nIf you're like my wife, it's not just the ingredients that need to be gluten free, but also the pots, pans, knives, serving utensils, and prep surfaces that need to be gluten free. Keeping those all separated in a single kitchen is challenging, unless you want dedicated gluten-free cookware and dedicated gluten cookware with matching gluten-free and gluten sponges. \n\nGluten will stick to anything porous - so it'll stick to wooden/plastic cutting boards, sponges, non-stick pans, pretty much anything besides metal, glass, ceramics, and porcelain. For my wife and I, it's not worth her getting sick due to some cross contamination. We have dedicated gluten pots and pans that we keep separate with a dedicated gluten sponge, but we rarely use them and when we do we are very careful to keep them separate.\n\nPart of it is finding the right gluten-free products. For dry pastas, gluten-free products from Italy actually do a good job on being gluten-free and being tasty. My wife and I found a dry pasta that we really liked that you couldn't tell the difference. I forget the brand, but I think it's called 'le veneziane.' Same thing for other types of products, sometimes it takes a while to find one that you really like that works. \n\nIt can be tough to find good gluten-free products, but I think it's probably tougher to maintain a mixed gluten-free and gluten kitchen. If you would like any recommendations for types of products, let me know and I'll ask my wife. When I saw and learned how much it affected my wife's health, I was more than willing to keep our kitchen and cooking as gluten-free as possible. I hope you're able to find something that works for your health and your situation.", "NTA and as someone who thought they had a gluten intolerance, in this day and age, most gluten free alternatives are delicious.", "Wow. Massive NTA. I simply can't stand the type of person who thinks for some reason that someone else is obliged to cook for them or cook what they want. He needs to either learn to cook for himself, buy ready meals or get takeaway. Btw if he does any of those you shouldn't be upset, it's ok for him to not like GF food.

But equally as it doesn't take long, surely you could also? \n\nYou're NTA for the pie, though. That takes a lot more time, and I wouldn't expect you to make two pies.", "YTA. If he's doing more of the chores to offset you cooking then yes, he should be able to have the gluten equivalent of the items he's stated that he does not want to eat the gf equivalent.\n\nI cannot really see how making two lots of pastry is such a big deal, as long as you make your first to avoid cross contamination. Certainly if such an issue, surely batch cooking is the solution?", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. I'll bet if you made one or two \"reg meals\" (which could be as small as 2 pots of water for pasta but also could be a bit more work like the steak pies) a week or just put in any amount of effort the make something he likes, he'd be fine with the GF meals. If he insists every meal had a GF option, then I'd change my stance and recommend renegotiating chores. Just seems like you're not willing to make any effort to accommodate him at all.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nI honestly don't think cooking both pastas take that long. I have one family member who loves angel hair pasta and the rest of us like a thicker pasta like spaghetti, rigatoni or something similar. I put 2 pots of water on the stove and it doesn't take any longer to make a difference. Making 2 smaller pies wouldn't take you longer than 5-10 minutes. \n\nHave your husband come into the kitchen and help you a little bit. Teach him!

I have to research resturants and take away places to see if they're safe to eat at. It's awkward when going to anyone else's house for dinner and I often have to plan ahead and bring my own food (although some friends are happy to try and cook something GF). I've never had to read food labels before in my life... shopping is taking twice as long. But I know I'll get used to it, I just don't know how to navigate this situation.", "My mom always said cooking for my vegan friend (about a decade before vegan stuff besides soy milk was available) is a challenge she enjoys. Same was making lactose free food for me", "The bad thing is, gluten can get into the pots and utensils. I\u2019m just gluten sensitive and I make gluten free dinners unless it\u2019s something like pizza rolls, then I have two sets of cookie sheets. One for me and one for them.  \n\nOP has coeliacs and contamination can lead to cancer and malnutrition, especially when it was caught so late in life.  As you remove gluten from your diet, you become much more sensitive to cross contamination. \n\nThe best advice I have is to keep trying different brands of gluten free foods. Some are garbage and others are close to gluten products.  OPs husband needs to realize that this isn\u2019t just some preference or health kick, it\u2019s her life. Gluten is poison to someone with coeliac disease and he can suck it up and eat gluten free at home.", "Luckily on the pasta front, they do have some gluten free noodle varieties that are pretty solid. We have to get the spaghetti for my partner and we both eat it even though I don't have the sensitivity issue. As long as it's not overcooked, you can barely tell. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better about cutting out gluten, my partner is still trying himself. It's present in a lot of his favorite snacks, but even cutting *down* the gluten intake has helped him tremendously.", "We have seperate toasters and bread bins. We don't have a mixer unfortunatley, always wanted one though! \n\nFor the occasions I have cooked GF and non GF food in the oven, the GF would go at the top.", "I've changes the recipes for my sauces slightly so they are GF. He doesn't mind (most of) the new sauces, they are pretty much the same (just a GF stock cube or GF flour to thicken depending on the sauce). So it would just be two pots of pasta. But it is actually a lot of extra work to avoid cross contamination and more cleaning up.", "I need to point this out for you: im celiac and need to be GF. we GF people need to have no cross contamination whatsoever. this means the pots need a complete scrub down after being exposed to wheat.", "Honestly, a Celiac flare up can be debilitating if she was exposed to cross contamination. She\u2019d be the AH to herself if she was constantly juggling two meals, one of which is not safe for her to consume, risking that it comes into contact with her own food. The fact she buys things with gluten in them and risks having them touching things in her kitchen is way more generous than I\u2019d be unless I knew for certain people were properly washing and disinfecting every single time.", "Cooking one GF and one gluten meal isn\u2019t just like cooking two slightly different varieties of a dish. Cross Contamination is a major issue and when I tried it, it drove me nuts. I had a rule that one side of the cooker would have gluten and one wouldn\u2019t, but I was constantly having to get a new spoon or remake something because I couldn\u2019t be totally sure I hadn\u2019t briefly touched something on the other side. We ended up deciding the kitchen had to be completely GF after various accidents, including the person with coeliac disease being taken to hospital with seizure-like neuro issues after accidentally drinking from a mug that hadn\u2019t been properly cleaned after containing regular beer.\n\nIn a professional kitchen they have one person working just on the GF food, completely sanitising their station before they start.", "Two sets of meals also means two sets of dishes. Is OP also expected to do the extra cleanup? Cooking two meals is a LOT more work and a lot more intense than cooking one meal.", "Making two pies would take a lot longer and it would be a huge contamination risk because of the flour and rolling pastry. The flour gets all over the kitchen and it'd take me ages to clean up so that it was safe for me to cook in after. \n\nI take your point about the pasta though. \n\nHe knows how to cook and does sometimes cook, he just doesn't like cooking and I don't mind. He makes up for not cooking by doing other things. \n\nWe both work full time.", "From experience, making your own GF pasta is difficult. The gluten is what holds the noodles together. I make a great pasta dough but all my efforts at doing the same with GF flour have been pretty disastrous.", "And the risk of cross contamination is high from making things with it. Wheat flour gets *everywhere* and clings to things. It's part of why it's in so many products like glue, makeup, and shampoo! Wheat flour can *also* be airborne for 12-24 hours as well. \n\nEven if OP isn't sensitive enough for an airborne reaction to be triggered, I would be *ashamed* of myself as a partner if I ever asked my partner to make me a pie and exposing themselves to something potentially like that. OP said he doesn't even want to boil his own pasta!\n\nHe can cook his own meals when he wants something different. Maybe make a meal planner for the week, so if he doesn't want something, he can plan his own meal for that day", "To be honest, my opinion didn't change after \"I'm celiac\". No, you're not TA for not cooking a meal that risks you getting bowel cancer. You're being pretty generous to let it in your house.", "My sibling was diagnosed last year and a couple people in my family are acting like your husband. I have had several stern conversations explaining to them that they are flat out assholes and I\u2019d be happy to explain it to your husband as well. I am so sorry you are married to someone so incredibly selfish.", "The way you said steak pie makes me think you possibly live in the uk so the gluten free dishes are probably different but even though it can be annoying I get it I was fine for a long time then not to long after high school is when it started effecting me. My mom has it and she passed the gene down to me it\u2019s hereditary and at the time we went and got blood tests which showed we had the gene but it wasn\u2019t active. It can activate from I think stress or trauma or something like that anyway. We have some good gluten free stuff here and a lot of restaurants actually have some gluten free buns but I don\u2019t know if you have those same restaurants but hey they do have gluten free Oreos which I think is a win. I actually made gluten free Oreo cheesecake bites for thanksgiving and everyone though they tasted the same as the regular Oreos so sometimes things can be very good. Like the gluten free bisquick mix makes great pancakes And great biscuits that I use for sausage biscuits", "Does he understand how serious this diagnosis is? This isn't an intolerance (as unpleasant as that can be), this is a life changing diagnosis of a very serious disorder? You are facing a life of potentially serious medical problems, hospitalisation serious problems and he's whining that gluten free pasta isn't as nice?\n\nI think you're actually being too generous allowing him to have gluten products in the house - especially of the kind that can easily lead to contamination. Exposing yourself to gluten and risking contamination of your food just because he likes gluten containing products better is asking far too much.\n\nI agree with him that gluten free products kinda suck but if my partner had coeliacs I'd literally bin everything in the house with gluten and do whatever it took to protect their health. My discomfort over crap gluten free bread is nothing compared to the impact on someone with coeliacs of ingesting gluten. \n\nNTA.", "Sounds like you are doing good, but I found that I got more sensitive over time (ironically, as I got better at limiting exposure, lol). Be careful and don't let him get in your head about this - keep yourself safe \n\nYou're actually lucky not to have a mixer yet. Now, when you get one, it will be pristine and all yours :) \n\nIt's maybe worth pointing out to him that kissing and such after someone has eaten gluten will make you sick as well, so by scarfing pasta, he's limiting other activities", "That\u2019s fair. Sounds like he needs to start doing his own cooking. Celiac cross-contamination is no joke. \n\nFWIW, my best friend has celiac, diagnosed about 3 years ago, and she found one of the best ways to handle it (since her and her husband were major foodies) was to opt more frequently for food that was GF to begin with rather than trying to modify. Phaidon has a GF cookbook that is exactly this and lovely. I pull it out to cook from whenever they come over for dinner. Absolutely no obligation to do this and NTA! Just throwing it out there in case it is helpful:).", "We have enough pots and a dishwasher (but we handwash pots, and our regular washing is good enough!), so I *could* make two pastas (with the same sauce). I think I will probably start making pasta for him, but not other things as these would take a lot longer. I just feel like it's generally a lot of extra work, like then needing to clean two pots, two strainers, two spoons etc.", "Don't you usually scrub pots after using them anyway? Is there an extra cleaning process? Genuinely curious.", "I know, but you could use different pots and drain the gluten-free pasta first. You can also use two different spoons etc. Only TA for not cooking some pasta, I wouldn't expect any other extra meal to be made.", "We have a dishwasher for our crockery, so that's not a problem. We now have seperate toasters and bread bins. I wouldn't expect to have a totally gluten free house.", "That doesn't at all seem like it is the scenario from OP's post. But in this extreme case, I'm sure the husband wouldn't be asking for normal meals. \n\nOP is not in a professional kitchen. \n\nYou've completely ignored the actual response though and are enabling OP to continue to not accommodate at all for their spouse. OP could offer to renegotiate chores/responsibilities if their spouse no longer enjoys the food OP is preparing. I understand coping with the medical issue but ignoring your spouses concerns isn't the answer either. Address them through healthy communication.", "[deleted]", "In your situation I wouldn\u2019t even allow regular flour in the kitchen. The stuff gets everywhere. It isn\u2019t safe. If it\u2019s ready made, that\u2019s a lot easier to avoid.", "I was thinking you could use a ready-made pie crust for him. You unroll it directly into the pie plate. Pillsbury makes a pretty good one. If he resists it, then he can make his own!", "Yeah, it's one of those things that needs the extra binders to hold it together. It's either gotta be one of the **good** flour blends or a whole extra bag of binders on hand like xanthan gum. It's definitely easier to just get the boxed dry noodles because it's at least guaranteed that it'll hold up.", "I have a decent amount of family with celiac. Cross contamination is an incredibly real and dangerous risk that OPs husband is asking her to take on by asking her to make things both ways. \n\nOne of my sisters has an extra toaster that she only brings out when our other sister with celiac visits, just so she can avoid the risk of cross contaminated toast. Even more extreme, Our wealthy grandfather literally bought a neighboring beach cabin so that our aunt with celiac could have a completely separate kitchen she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about during family events. \n\nDon\u2019t fuck around with risking gluten exposure, it\u2019s not worth it.", "Yeah, that's happened after beer!", "You do have to scrub the pots after like normal, but we do have to put a little extra effort in. It's not nearly as bad as keeping kosher, but it's definitely more than normal. Basically I have to scrub twice if the pots are going to be used for something other than gluten-free food.", "Since she's so early into her diagnosis, I don't expect her to know all of the little tricks and best ways to get amazing gluten-free food, but at the same time she also doesn't know how to care for her autoimmune disorder the same way that someone like me who's been doing this for 20 years knows. I also think it's good that she doesn't cook wheat at the moment. I think it's important for her to learn all the tips and tricks beforehand.", "The reason I brought up procedures in a professional kitchen is that if you won\u2019t ask trained professionals to mix up GF and non GF meals in the same place and at the same time because you risk poisoning your customers, it might be a risky idea to insist it happens in the home most nights. In terms of accommodations I treat serious health risk over the chance of the pastry being insufficiently flaky.", "For a person with celiac who needs to be careful of cross contamination it can also mean extra utensils, strainers, anything that touches the gluten pasta has to have a gluten free equivalent. That\u2019s a lot more dishes and mental gymnastics than \u201cone small pot\u201d", "Until things get crossed contaminated, for OPs health. I have celiac's my wife and I tried that for a while, and it worked for about a month, until it didn't. Not a good time. It's not as simple as ordering the gluten free stuff. The environment has to be gluten free too.", "I agree with you. I have dietary restrictions because of medical issues and when I started living with my husband he took in my diet without complaint. If he came to me and said 'honey I miss the steaks and pork, is there any way we can incorporate them back in for me?' I would at least TRY some solutions before determining they're too hard. Like...people do live together with different dietary needs, including cross contamination, why wouldn't you just try first?", "Gotcha, thanks for the info.", "This. I can't cook gf en regular pasta next to each other. It took me a while to figure out why I was feeling sick after eating pasta, but I guess during cooking it's all just too close to each other and it gets contaminated. Lids only do so much, tried that too.\n\nNTA.\n\nOne fully gf meal a day should not be a problem.", "It's not about *not trying*, it's about how much extra time and work it will take to cook two seperate meals or adaptions every day. I've said he is welcome to cook his own pasta, but he doesn't want to.", "Thank you! I totally agree with you. You sound amazing!"]}
