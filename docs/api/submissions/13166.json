It's not a dietary choice I'd choose to make, but it's medically necessary. \n\nI live with my husband (32M) and I do all the grocery shopping and cooking (he does an equal share of chores). Since my diagnosis I have adapted all our meals to be gluten free. Although gluten free food is a lot more expensive, it's easier to cook one meal for both of us rather than two seperate meals. Some of the gluten free alternatives are (subjectively) not as nice as the \"regular\" version. For example dried pasta and ready rolled pastry. Others don't make a difference, like stock cubes, GF saussages etc. \n\nMy husband has recently started complaining that my food isn't as good as it used to be and he wants me to make the \"normal\" versions again. For example, if I made a pasta sauce, he would want me to cook both regular and GF pasta or if I made a steak pie, he'd want me to make two (smaller) pies. I said I wouldn't be able to do this as already I spend a lot of time cooking. I said I would happily continue to buy him \"normal\" foods, and if he wanted to cook the regular versions, I would make enough sauce/filling and he could finish the rest. \n\nThis led to an argument, where he called me selfish and said I was punishing him for my diagnosis. I have always done the cooking, and he said that he should still be able to eat the food that he likes. He said that he does more general housework because I do the cooking, and by asking him to cook his own food (even if it was just the pasta) would mean that our pre-agreed spilt of housework was no longer fair.

I only cook gluten free and even my friends are cool with me cooking GF for for holiday parties. in fact, we all make sure that we all can enjoy. I remember a while ago, we had a nut free, gluten free, dairy free, and vegan party because there was at least 1 person in the group that needed it. the food was amazing. its just a matter of learning to cook in a new way. \n\nstraight up, if you want, hit me up and I can help you with the GF living. I have dozens of recipes, tips and tricks, and suggestions that can help you.", "You're NTA. While it would be easy to boil a separate pot of water for pasta on nights you're having a pasta dish, you should not be expected to make two completely separate meals every night. He can either suck it up, or help cook. Waving the \"I do housework flag\" if all the other chores are split is childish and irrelevant.

It would be so hard to prevent cross-contamination for you when you're cooking both things at once. Just one mistake with a spoon could do it and you'd be glutened.", "NTA You\u2019re Celiac. This isn\u2019t a small thing, and there are good arguments to be made that you shouldn\u2019t even handle glutinous food.\n\nConsider making meals that were never intended to be gluten-based. There\u2019s maybe only one brand of GF pasta that\u2019s remotely good,   and only one brand of bread. I can\u2019t imagine that the replacement pastry doesn\u2019t taste like paste.

As he does the majority of cooking, I am just happy to eat whatever he makes.\n\nWhen it comes to pasta, though, we do have it separately as GF pasta is very expensive.  It's much cheaper to use 'normal' pasta for me and the kids and save the GF just for him.\n\nAnything else (gravy, stock cubes, flour, etc) we just use the GF version to make everyone's life easier.  Plus, the consequences of him accidentally eating gluten are not pleasant as I'm sure you can agree.", "NTA, you should cook for you, you are the one that goes through pain and discomfort if you don\u2019t. If he doesn\u2019t like the food at all, I understand that, but then he should cook his own. \n\n\nAs for the share of chores, this is a bit more tricky, but I don\u2019t think laundry, for example, takes as much time and effort as cooking and shopping. \n\n\nIf he would have to now cook a significant amount of his meals, perhaps add one or two chores to your side of things, but other than that, no.", "NTA, you got a life changing diagnosis and he\u2019s being the selfish one.", "NTA  \nHaving to go gluten free is a HUGE adjustment for you.   It sounds like you have made suggestions for compromises and he's throwing a fit.", "NTA. I have no idea how people are giving \"ESH\". You have an illness you didn't ask for and it's not an easy thing to cook two versions of a meal. Your partner needs to adjust and support you. Maybe this means a new conversation around labour divisions sure, but it doesn't make you the asshole.\n\nMarriage is for better or worse, in sickness and in death. Man needs to grow up about it. Alternatively, tell him to alternate cooking and he can cook for himself and for you - why should it always be you who does it?", "NTA, but it sounds like it's time to redistribute the chores so that you are either freed up to cook separate meals or he is the one freed up to cook his own. Would need to be careful that the chores end up being evenly redistributed.", "NTA\n\nYou're the cook, you make the food, that's what's being served. I'm the cook in my previous and current household, and as much as I love to cook, I don't wanna do it every day, let alone twice almost every weeknight.

This is a huge life adjustment for you, one that could make you very sick if you were to accidentally cross-contaminate while cooking two separate meals at the same time. Not to mention that it's a lot of extra dishes and extra work to cook two meals at once, especially since there would be extensive cross contamination issues - you can't even use the same utensils or surfaces when cooking for gluten free! Your health is more important than his taste buds.", "NTA. It sounds like you two have a great balance of chores and you are doing your best to make sure that your husband still gets to enjoy the food he likes, while also taking care of your medical needs. It's understandable that he feels like he needs to get something out of the deal too. Maybe you could suggest a compromise where you can both get what you need. For example, you could make a gluten free version of a dish and he could make a regular version. That way you both get to eat what you like and you get to share the cooking load.", "NTA - I cook two dinners because my oldest son has sensory issues.

Our current situation is a good middle ground so far. If I want something she can't have, it's only reasonable that I prepare that myself.\n\nI don't find this to be unreasonable because it's my wife's health at stake, and that's the most important thing.\n\nWe've encountered many people who don't seem to understand how serious coeliac is and don't feel a certain level of care or effort is necessary. It sounds a bit like your husband has the same mindset.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NTA the chance of contamination is high I can\u2019t even imagine keeping glutinous products in the kitchen at all besides prepackaged goods that can be eaten directly from the package.

He needs to grow up. If he doesn't like the gluten-free version and you still are doing the majority of the prep do he can fix his own. You have fulfilled your part.\n\nOn a side note, check out lectin free. Some controversy but gluten is a lectin also. I'm personally lowering my lectin exposure, and the IBS I struggle with is finally under control.", "I'd be so beyond angry if my husband acted like this. I can't currently have milk because our daughter has a sensitivity and I'm nursing. So I stopped buying a number of things that were normal for us, like a weekly grocery store pizza. We both acknowledge that it sucks, but I do the shopping and most of the cooking. If there's something my husband wants that I can't have, he makes or modifies it himself, just like what you suggested. It's not hard. He can either suck it up and be fine with things how they are, or he can start putting forth more effort to change things the way he wants. NTA", "NTA. Celiac isn't a dietary preference, it's your health.\n\nIf you're like my wife, it's not just the ingredients that need to be gluten free, but also the pots, pans, knives, serving utensils, and prep surfaces that need to be gluten free. Keeping those all separated in a single kitchen is challenging, unless you want dedicated gluten-free cookware and dedicated gluten cookware with matching gluten-free and gluten sponges. \n\nGluten will stick to anything porous - so it'll stick to wooden/plastic cutting boards, sponges, non-stick pans, pretty much anything besides metal, glass, ceramics, and porcelain. For my wife and I, it's not worth her getting sick due to some cross contamination. We have dedicated gluten pots and pans that we keep separate with a dedicated gluten sponge, but we rarely use them and when we do we are very careful to keep them separate.\n\nPart of it is finding the right gluten-free products. For dry pastas, gluten-free products from Italy actually do a good job on being gluten-free and being tasty. My wife and I found a dry pasta that we really liked that you couldn't tell the difference. I forget the brand, but I think it's called 'le veneziane.' Same thing for other types of products, sometimes it takes a while to find one that you really like that works. \n\nIt can be tough to find good gluten-free products, but I think it's probably tougher to maintain a mixed gluten-free and gluten kitchen. If you would like any recommendations for types of products, let me know and I'll ask my wife. When I saw and learned how much it affected my wife's health, I was more than willing to keep our kitchen and cooking as gluten-free as possible. I hope you're able to find something that works for your health and your situation.", "NTA and as someone who thought they had a gluten intolerance, in this day and age, most gluten free alternatives are delicious.", "Wow. Massive NTA. I simply can't stand the type of person who thinks for some reason that someone else is obliged to cook for them or cook what they want. He needs to either learn to cook for himself, buy ready meals or get takeaway. Btw if he does any of those you shouldn't be upset, it's ok for him to not like GF food.

But equally as it doesn't take long, surely you could also? \n\nYou're NTA for the pie, though. That takes a lot more time, and I wouldn't expect you to make two pies.", "YTA. If he's doing more of the chores to offset you cooking then yes, he should be able to have the gluten equivalent of the items he's stated that he does not want to eat the gf equivalent.\n\nI cannot really see how making two lots of pastry is such a big deal, as long as you make your first to avoid cross contamination. Certainly if such an issue, surely batch cooking is the solution?", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. I'll bet if you made one or two \"reg meals\" (which could be as small as 2 pots of water for pasta but also could be a bit more work like the steak pies) a week or just put in any amount of effort the make something he likes, he'd be fine with the GF meals. If he insists every meal had a GF option, then I'd change my stance and recommend renegotiating chores. Just seems like you're not willing to make any effort to accommodate him at all.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nI honestly don't think cooking both pastas take that long. I have one family member who loves angel hair pasta and the rest of us like a thicker pasta like spaghetti, rigatoni or something similar.

Making 2 smaller pies wouldn't take you longer than 5-10 minutes. \n\nHave your husband come into the kitchen and help you a little bit. Teach him!

I have coeliac disease and I\u2019m in a two person household. We just make our own meals, we each have one side of the kitchen to avoid cross contamination and share the same meal once a week (spag Bol and garlic bread normally) which causes no issues because the other person actually enjoys it. It\u2019s really not that difficult for us to make our own meals, we clean up our own pots and pans afterwards and it works fine. Your husband is being a baby, tell him to make his own food. \n\n(Off topic) You mentioned being diagnosed a couple of months ago, If you have Facebook, I recommend joining a coeliac Facebook group, I\u2019m in one and it\u2019s great, people share recipes, restaurants that offer great GF food as well as pictures of products from supermarkets that they enjoy. It really helped me find food I enjoy.", "Oh, Lord, NTA on this one. Punishing him for your disease? How childish and selfish can a spouse be? Celiac disease is serious business - it's NOT one of these gluten-is-evil things, it's a major autoimmune condition with major consequences if the affected person eats gluten. You didn't ask your body to do this to you and you are not punishing him for cooking to keep yourself healthy and alive.\n\nYou have enough to deal with without having to cook two meals because your husband has decided he can't or won't (hint- it's won't) adapt to a new way of eating. There is no reason in the world you should be cooking separate meals for the two of you. If learning to live with a gluten-free diet is too heavy a lift for him then he can prepare his own meals. Your husband needs to grow up and become a supportive partner instead of a whiny child.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is a huge jerk. He can't reasonably expect you to cook 2 meals or 2 versions of the same meal... this is ridiculous. And you're right, if he doesn't like what you cooked he can do his own food. As you still cook for him, and he the choice to eat it, this shouldn't affect any of the other chores. \n\nBut seriously he sounds extremely ungenerous and petty if he counts it up to the last second spent on chores,  and beware you have 5 minutes more free time than him, than he whines worse than a toddler... this isn't how a healthy partnership works. Also his disrespect for your medical condition is very rude. (And honestly, even if would just be a lifestyle choice, wouldn't change anything here. The one cooking makes the choice what's being cooked).", "NTA. Your husband is being an ungrateful jerk. He wants something different, he can make it himself.", "NTA. Let him cook his own meals instead of burdening you to cook two separate meals.", "NTA. I have had to eat gluten free for almost 20 years. Every partner I\u2019ve had eats gluten free when with me when we cook at home for just the two of us. If there\u2019s company, maybe I\u2019d made a gluten version. And none of them bitched about it. And it was WAY more difficult and more bland tasting to eat gluten free back in the day", "NTA. He\u2019s a jerk. You aren\u2019t banning gluten from the house. He\u2019s being selfish", "Are you kidding me? My partner does all the cooking because I\u2019m hopeless in the kitchen and get scared of fire/oil/boiling water/ any noises. We sometimes eat separate things, but never in a \u201cplease cook two meals\u201d way. Yikes. NTA", "NTA, dynamics work differently for every family. \nI do shop for and make a dinner for everyone else in my family. They are all keto and I can't eat keto because I have gastroparesis. I just get something else for myself or only eat the meats out of the meal I make for them. But that's my choice. He needs to respect what works (or not) for you.", "NTA. My sister is gluten intolerant, and cooks mostly GF for her and her husband, but if he wants something that isn\u2019t GF then HE is the one who cooks it. It makes no sense for you to cook two meals.", "NTA. I have celiac, my spouse does not, our house is GF. Expecting you to cook two separate meals is ridiculous.\n\nAlso have you tried Jovial GF Pasta? It is my favorite and the only one that is authentic pasta IMO. Only the brown rice one, they have a new cassava type that is gross.", "I got my diagnosis last week. You know what my husband did? Helped me get rid of all the food that would make me sick, helped clean out cooking stuff, and then we came up with a game plan for us and the kids. You are NTA", "Our son also isn't allowed to eat gluten. So I cook gluten free. But I prepare for example two types of noodles. It is much cheaper to cook gluten free noodles for one person and it is really not o problem to boil water in two different pots. The sauce is gluten free, since it is much more work to prepare to different sauces. Maybe that is a solution", "I'd be interested in some of those recipes as well! I was diagnosed last year.", "My husband has celiac and our older son is allergic to wheat. Younger son and I eat gluten free because our house is the one place they can eat freely. Easy choice to make.", "My husband did the same last year when I got diagnosed. HE cleaned out all of the flour and everything so I would have to risk touching it. I didn\u2019t do any of the kitchen clean out. Then he bought me all new appliances and says absolutely nothing about the fully GF meals that I cook. \n\nMy kids also don\u2019t complain. If my son wants mac & cheese, he cooks it himself (he\u2019s 12, but been doing this since he was 10) and understands he what he can/can\u2019t use in the kitchen. \n\nTurns out my family would prefer a healthy wife/mom as opposed to one constantly sick and at risk of cancer.", "Posts like this make me want to say things that would get me banned. Dude is literally demanding his wife slowly poison herself because he can\u2019t handle the thought ( not the taste, the thought ) of some gf spaghetti. \n\nOP if you see this, tinkyada and jovial are the best GF pastas. There\u2019s tons of GF  stuff that\u2019s really really good. You absolutely should not ever cook with gluten again, and frankly your kitchen should BE GF too. I guarantee your spouse is a cross contamination nightmare and is making you sick.", "> risk of cross contamination is high\n\nI have celiac and my partner doesn't but we keep the house mostly gluten free (outside of instant food or takeaway that my partner eats) to minimize cross contamination. It would be very difficult to cook two meals at the same time and avoid cross contamination even if you segment the kitchen. At minimum, you'd need to wash your hands every time you switched back to the gluten free side.\n\nSwitching to gluten free can be a pain because all of your cooking instincts will be slightly off because substitute ingredients don't behave exactly the same and it won't taste exactly the same. But my partner doesn't want me to be ill so has figured out how to cook amazing things gluten free. The OP's husband needs to suck it up or do his own cooking (even then, I would be worried he wouldn't take cross contamination seriously because many people don't).", "Is that because a bit of exposure is good, like how if you lived in a bubble with zero disease then your immune system would weaken?", "It's an extra process, but it's also that she would now be cleaning two pots, two strainers, two spoons, etc.", "OP said she has celiac. Cross -contamination is enormously risky.", "I\u2019ve tried every trick I can find. Xantham gum, custom flour blends, etc. In the end it\u2019s all just \u201cmeh\u201d.", "Celiac here with non celiac husband and son who've been nothing but supportive. I can't imagine the hassle and risk of cooking two meals. I'm such a ditz at times I'd likely mix them up and scoff the wrong one. \n\nSmall name drop for 'the loopy whisk' though for amazing gf baking - including bread.", "No, it's not. Celiac disease is not about a \"weak\" immune system. It's your immune system going haywire and attacking your own body when you are exposed to gluten. So any exposure to gluten can not only cause unpleasant effects at the time, but over time can cause serious, debilitating illness.", "I was asking a question to the commenter above, not OP. I agree that OP should not have to clean extra dishes. I was simply asking if there is a different cleaning process for pots and pans used by those with celiac, as I am unfamiliar.", "Apparently, not a lot of people here have common sense and a willingness to compromise with their partners who they claim to love. Oh, well. That's what divorce lawyers are for! Lol!", "That's fair. It's never really going to be the same as the original."]}
