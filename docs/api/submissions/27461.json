Four person won't pass at the same moment. Yes, you could do it with the first one, but others will know you betrayed their trust.\n\nAnd your family is really deceptive.

Sometimes people who are too bound or blinded with religion and culture are not able to see and believe anything beyond their rules. They don't understand that these rules are not a one size fits all. I don't really understand their disagreement here because it is none of there business. It's not going to harm them in any way if you cremate your family members. They're going to lose nothing.\n\nI think you should do what your family wants. That's being respectful towards them. And that'll will be the last thing you would be doing for them anyways. So don't bother what others say. If it's going to give you and them a sense of peace in the end then do it.", "It doesn't matter what the anti-cremation people tell you to do with someone else's remains.

Like someone else said, they left you to be in charge bc they know that the other family members would not respect their wishes. Make sure you really get some sort of documentation or whatever stating their wishes to be cremated and then fuck what the family thinks bc that\u2019s not their choice. \n\nI went through this EXACT same situation when my grandmother died but it was the opposite. I knew how much she was strongly against cremation. Her family pushed for cremation bc they \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford\u201d a burial which was a crock of shit. The whole situation turned into a nightmare. I didn\u2019t give a fuck about how they felt or how mad they got bc I knew at least in my heart that I was trying to respect her wishes.", "Even the Catholic Church condones cremation. If they feel they need to be buried, well they DO bury cremation Urns or Boxes, so you can still honor their wishes AND have a burial. They came to you, specifically because they knew the Others wouldn't honor their wishes.

Im with you in that it is very disrespectful to go against a persons wishes on what to do when they have passed away. \n\nMany Crematoriums and Churches have Scrolls or a Book of Remembrance, Memorial Walls with Tablets or Niches, Rose Memorials. Some that have extensive gardens and/or cemetery's might offer other services such as benches, hanging baskets, planters, vases and other memorials to be placed in their grounds. \n\n\nIf they haven't already specified a memorial of some kind I would speak to the 4 family members and ask if they are ok with any of these things so that loved ones have a place to go mourn them, talk to them, honour them, leave flowers etc.", "NTA - this is exactly why you were given the task, those family members are untrustworthy", "NTA. I get a kick out of how religious people always preach about morals and how virtuous they all are, then they pull shit like this lol yeah just bury them anyway, they're dead, they won't know the difference. What a way to talk about family members. I would just say it's not up to them, it's up the person who makes their wishes. I can't stand how some folks think that everyone should cater to their religious beliefs. I would tell them to pound sand and go ahead with cremations.", "YWNBTA\n\nIf you know their wishes and you've been put in charge, then go ahead and ignore the complaints.\n\nBut check what are their wishes for \\*after\\* the  cremation. The Catholic Church, for example, no longer objects to cremation \\*as long as the ashes are buried together\\*, i.e. they still disapprove of scattering the ashes.  So when my very Catholic elderly aunt died, we had a funeral and cremation and a month later a little ceremony where we buried the ashes in her parents' grave, and duly added her name  to the gravestone.\n\nFor all the fuss about cremation vs burial, there are even more arguments about what happens to cremation ashes - just google \"AITA ashes\" and you'll find some horror stories. I think cremation and burying the ashes in a family grave or a columbarium is a good choice because it still gives a memorial for those who want to visit. But if your relatives want their ashes scattered at sea or made into jewellery or distributed among the whole family then of course you should follow their wishes.", "Nta. \u2018Sorry, cremation. It\u2019s out of my hands\u2019.", "Nta the other family members need to stay out of it, it's not their decision.", "NTA. Have those that asked you to handle their future business contact the disagreeing family members, email would be best, and explain what they have directed you to do.", "I just cannot. Other people's religious beliefs have nothing do do with your loved one's last wishes.  \n\nNTA.  Do as asked, please.", "NTA - It is literally technically just speeding up thr natural process. Efficient decomp basically.", "You can always bury the ashes .", "NTA - New flash...the Bible says nothing about cremation being wrong. Absolutely nothing. Aks then to justify why it's wrong from the Bible. They won't be able to.", "\"Oh god, this isn't sand!  It's Aunt Mildred!\"", "I meant it more like \u201cother family suggested I disregard their wishes\u201d but you\u2019re correct thank you for letting me know.", "Thank for NTA, just to clarify, I would never change my mind on doing what they wish. It\u2019s just particularly hard because Im living with the family with opposing views and have gotten very close to them within the last few years.", "You made me laugh", "NTA other family can mind their own darn business and decide for THEMSELVES\n \nAsk them if they were the ones dead would they like you to ignore their whishes and cremate them since the family might decide it's the correct way?! N then they need to stay in their lane and stop being controlling ahs.\n\nOr donating their organs for example if they don't want to be a donor."]}
