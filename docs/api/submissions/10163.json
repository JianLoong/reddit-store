He also has recently started trying to look at me when I change or use the bathroom, which my mom says is fine because he\u2019s a boy and 6, but if he does this to anyone who ISNT family, he\u2019s going to get in trouble. \n\nRecently I was in a large t-shirt (I wear baggy shirts instead of pajamas) and was just going to the kitchen to grab something to eat before going back to my room, where my door was closed. The shirt went to my knees, so it wasn\u2019t like I was in a crop top and nothing else. He tried to get under my shirt, to look at me. I told him to stop, and held him back. He kept shoving at me, and wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\nMy mom says it\u2019s my fault for not putting on \u201creal clothes\u201d but I literally was going 20 feet to grab a bag of chips, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t been scared to leave my room without \u201creal clothes\u201d in my own house. \n\nI said \u201cstop being creepy and trying to look at me.\u201d The other day, because I had it, he was naked and dancing in front of my room, since he opened the door, and kept trying to look under my dress (I had gone out earlier) my mom got mad and said I was being cruel and never to call him creepy because I don\u2019t know \u201cwhat it\u2019s like for guys to be creepy\u201d\n\nHe also has been saying I can\u2019t do things anymore such as play Xbox or go out with friends because \u201cI\u2019m a noob girl and he\u2019s a pro hacker boy\u201d (I\u2019m not kidding these are his exact words) and my mom doesn\u2019t stop him. I\u2019m sick of him being sexist, even if he\u2019s 6.\n\nIn my eyes, 6 is more than old enough to know that it\u2019s wrong to try and look at women weirdly, dance naked (and inappropriately, he KNOWS what he\u2019s doing) and to be rude when I\u2019m not doing anything to him. \n\nAITA for calling him that and not being more \u201cunderstanding\u201d since he is only 6?", "created_utc": 1676595836, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1146ki0/aita_for_calling_my_brother_creepy_and_not/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I grew up with my younger brother being just a measly two years behind me. We shared a room for YEARS and he never tried to do any weird shit like this, and I almost always only wore a shirt and underwear to bed, and often around the house if it was near bedtime. They shouldn't be policing your body and he shouldn't be acting that way either, especially at 6. He learned it somewhere.", "Your parents are allowing you to be harassed.

His actions are inappropriate no matter what his age is.  He needs to understand personal space, consent, and keeping his own clothes on and your parents are failing in there job by not teaching him these things.", "NTA. My nephew tried to do the same to me and a few other ladies. All it took was getting a knot snatched in his tail once and he never did it again. Because he learned that such behavior will not be tolerated.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s six, his parents should be teaching him boundaries and respect. As it is, he\u2019s a growing creep. \n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA, your parents should be teaching him to respect other people's boundaries and that what he's doing is inappropriate. Even if he doesn't realise what he's doing your parents need to teach him these behaviours are wrong or it's going to cause even more issues in the future. Your parents are massive AH for not disciplining or correcting him, and also for saying it's your fault. They sound toxic af and it's most definitely not your fault that they're enabling this behaviour, you should be able to feel comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. This is all wholly inappropriate behavior being dismissed and excused under \"boys are all creepy, boys will be boys\" nonsense. Your parents are failing spectacularly, and dare I say you should report it to proper authorities. Let them get a visit from children's services and see how they defend it.", "You\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m sorry your parents are not protecting you. Your brother may not understand the sexual nature of what he\u2019s doing bc of his age, but he certainly understands that you do not like what he\u2019s doing to you. \n\nDo you have any trusted family members who can help you? A grandparent or aunt/uncle (or your father?) who\u2019d care if you told them your brother keeps trying to look at your private parts and your parents won\u2019t stop him?", "NTA. 6 is in kindergarten which means he is way too old to be hanging out naked. Sounds like he may have issues your parents are too lazy to deal with.", "Nta. Nor is your brother since he doesn't know any better.

She should be protecting you, not raising him to turn into a sex offender! This kid's going to grow up thinking this is okay. Your mom needs to get her head out of her ass and start being the parent you both need. What a disgusting reaction. \n\n>I change or use the bathroom, which my mom says is fine because he\u2019s a boy and 6, but if he does this to anyone who ISNT family, he\u2019s going to get in trouble. \n\nNo, it isn't! She's helping to raise a creep. It doesn't matter how old he is! His father needs to teach him how to act around others and teach him to respect boundaries. \n\nI hope you can get out of there as soon as possible. Was your mom always this toxic or does she just love her stepkid more? Are there other family or friends you can stay with?", "NTA. You're right, this behavior is ridiculous and your parents should be stopping it", "NTA. But this is concerning as sexulized behavior is one of the warning signs of sexual abuse in children.", "Your parents definitely need to take this situation more seriously cause this behavior will just continue into his adulthood. Your stepdad is immature, treating you differently just because you're not his child, extremely toxic. I hope you get away from these people and find happiness.", "OP I think you need to talk to authorities or a trusted adult. Please get out of there.", "NTA, but it's your parents who are AHs not your brother who is a creep. All kids are different and a lot of 6 year olds act like that and need to be corrected. It's not a sexual thing for them, just a combo of curiosity and finding it fun to get reactions out of people.\n\nBoys especially seem to be more likely to get naked, probably because people get more freaked out about a little girl stripping in front of adults and stop it when they're much younger. But 6 really is an age where they should be stopping him.", "Nta. Your brother doesn\u2019t respect you and your boundaries. Not only that but your parents are enabling this behavior by not correcting him. Gives me \u201cboys will be boys\u201d vibes.", "NTA. Start recording him. Every time he is inappropriate, violent, etc., record it. Save them on the cloud or send them to an email on you have access to so even if your parents take your phone it's recoverable. Show your parents & tell them that if this doesn't stop you are telling a trusted adult or a mandatory reporter. This behavior does not stop on it's own without consequences & if he continues he will turn into one of those \"but if she didn't want it why was she dressed that way\" dudes. For your safety & the safety of every person he comes into contact with once he hits puberty, this behavior needs to be nipped in the bud.", "NTA. Based on how your family treats your grandfather's actions as normal, there is a chance your brother is also being abused. Imo you should contact a counselor from your school or CPS and tell them what is going on and ask that someone check with your brother to make sure he isn't being sexually abused. Let them know that your family does nothing to discourage this behavior and it makes you feel unsafe in your own home. Btw do you know if he acts this way in school/in public or is it just to you?\n\nIf he isn't being abused he might be doing it to get a reaction out of you. Unfortunately if that is the case the best way to discourage that behavior is to ignore it completely and pretend he doesn't exist when he is acting out. In cases like this the person wants attention no matter if it is positive or negative so you have to use your attention as a \"reward\" for whenever he isn't acting out. If he gets bored and walks away? Start talking to him like normal. But the instant he tries to act inappropriately again, he doesn't exist to you anymore. It can be really hard to keep consistent about this but just do your best.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work and you need a way to get away from him without violence you might try carrying a small squirt bottle of water around with you so whenever he tries something you can spritz him. That way you don't have to use physical force and normally people will instinctively use their hands to cover their face/eyes and back off, giving you the opportunity to get away from him.", "When a child that young is inappropriately sexual, there's a strong possibility it's the result of abuse. I'll bet child protective services would want to look into that.", "NTA and this 6 year old is going to have major problems if parents don't start teaching him appropriate behavior.", "Lord no. NTA.\n\nReport his behaviour and your parents to a teacher. \n\nKeep as much evidence as possible. Write the date, time, and what he/they did. \n\nIf you have a phone, film some of his antics (as long as he's fully dressed). \n\nSpend as much time as possible at the library or with friends if you can.", "NTA. Get yourself ready to get out of that household. Find a way to protect anything you consider valuable (a safe or lockable trunk) and keep your things in there to keep them away from the little brat. Locate and keep tabs on all your important documents (SS card, birth certificate, passport, transcripts). You may not be able to get them out of your parent\u2019s hands yet, but knowing where they all are and being able to get to them if necessary will help you immensely. Look for lock solutions that aren\u2019t permanent (door stops, etc.) for your door. Find a trusted adult (family member would be great, but any adult you can trust) that may be willing to help you with a safe place to go or with opening a bank account. \nIf you wanted to be petty, pick a time to walk around the house butt naked. When your mom and stepdad complain, tell them that they have no problem with [step-brother] doing it, and he\u2019s old enough to know better, so clearly it should be ok for you to behave the same. You could also tell them that you are well aware that you are the unwanted child that they have to put up with until you\u2019ve graduated high school (don\u2019t say until you\u2019re 18, because that will open you up to being kicked out on your 18th b-day), and the moment you leave for college they never have to worry about you darkening their doorstep again although they may be empty nester\u2019s at that point since [step-bro] will likely be in juvie by then since they refuse to teach him that no means no and he\u2019ll undoubtedly have SA multiple women by that time and the legal system will have hold of him.", "NTA. Yes he is 6 and little boys can get a bit obsessed with adults bodies (as can little girls - plenty of kids pull you shirt to look down). I\u2019ve experienced it a fair amount over the years. The difference is though, that in every case they were told no, by their parents and told that wasn\u2019t right and if they didn\u2019t stop their hands were physically moved or they were distracted with one of their toys etc. \n\nThe language and your parents\u2019 acceptance of his speaking to you like that isn\u2019t right - he might be too young to be considered truly creepy now but without your parents guidance he\u2019s well on the way to becoming a misogynist incel \u201cnice guy\u201d who feels entitled to women\u2019s bodies.", "NTA. You need to look into getting an Addalock for your bedroom. It goes in where the latch is, sticks out into your room and has a wedge that slides over it and will keep the door from opening. It's portable and requires no modification to the door. You can use it on your bedroom and if the little perv tries, use it on other doors. Bathroom for instance. One is pretty vulnerable while in the shower.\n\nThey also make child proof doorknob covers that slip on and require a good deal on hand strength to squeeze hard enough to turn the knob and not just spin the cover\n\nMy other advice would be to talk to your biodad and see if you could spend a weekend or two with him. Try and develop that relationship in hopes you could move in permanently. Your current situation is not healthy for you and I'm sorry you're stuck in it.", "NTA  I would discuss this with a trusted teacher at school. Let them call CPS because your stepbrother has some severe mental issue's going on. It is not normal for a six-year-old to be behaving like this. Home is supposed to be a safe place, and he's destroying that.", "This is more than a little boy being spoiled and misbehaving.  Something is very wrong and he is acting out.  Could your grandfather be molesting him?", "NTA your mom and your stepdad are raising a predator if they don\u2019t nip this in the butt somethings gonna happen in the future. Can you live with your dad can you tell your dad about the stuff I would honestly say that if they don\u2019t put a lock on your door and stop this behavior you\u2019re gonna go to other family members and tell them what\u2019s happening. Consequences be damned.", "NTA - You need to speak to someone at your school about this.  The fact your mom defends your grandfathers inappropriate behaviour towards you  as \"that's just how he shows love\" is seriously f-ed up.  \n\nNo wonder she sees no problem with what your brother is doing to you.  They're reinforcing your brothers bad behaviour by not punishing him. Unfortunately he's only going to get worse not better. They're raising a potential monster. He'll eventually start doing it to other girls at school if he isn't already and they're just too scared to say anything.", "YTA for thinking he is creepy but wanting to pawn a theoretical horse off on him once you out grow it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell her \"I told him I'm changing and he can't come in right now.\" And very carefully observe what she says in response and write it down later. If he can somehow push out a door wedge literally go nuclear and put something very heavy in front of the door whenever you change to keep him from getting inside.\n\nGod, I'm so sorry. You shouldn't have to feel unsafe in your own home or go to any length to protect yourself under your own roof.

There is something behind his abhorrent behaviour, and for whatever reason your parents are determined to turn a blind eye.\n\nTelling a mandated reporter or CPS could be as much to protect your brother as it would be for yourself!", "Prob the best way \u2026 it will force your parents to step up.", "THIS. \nMy son is almost NINE and still isn't allowed to watch YouTube. He's complained about it before but it's MY job as a parent to protect him from content he shouldn't be exposed to. \nOps parents are failing both of their children and CPS should absolutely be involved.", "If I was allowed to be online, I would show them, but they would kill me if they found out I was on reddit", "No, I kept my grandpa away from him best I could. I never realized I did, but now that I look back I probably knew deep down that I shouldn\u2019t let him near my brother, so for the most part I occupied my grandpas time", "I see your point, but at the same time, stepdad was much better a few years ago, my dad has always sucked, and her son is a massive handful. I was a quiet kid who read, and basically raised myself. 10 years later, she had a kid in this age, where everything is different, and he is basically the opposite of me. I can\u2019t blame her for struggling, especially since all her life she was in an abuse household and relationships. (Hell, she had me at 19, she\u2019s extremely young)", "Just say to your parent that's your way of showing love. And continu to do it.", "Door stoppers are about 1.25 at dollar tree. They can be put on from the inside to block it from opening", "Well yes, YouTube is the most likely vehicle if it's online but the point I'm making is that from the reading the post it seems like the parents are completely oblivious to the danger their son could be in or what he's doing at any given moment. He could be being groomed for abuse or being groomed in MRA groups (or both given the toxicity of those groups). It is a real risk that there is an adult playing an unseen and very nefarious role in the brother's life, or at the very least he's accessing dangerous material online. Meanwhile the parents aren't questioning how a six year old came to be expressing certain views and sexually explicit behaviours.", "My grandpa isn\u2019t with us anymore, and hasn\u2019t been for awhile thankfully, so I doubt it was him who made my brother act how he is. I just don\u2019t want to call CPS because I do love my mom and brother and don\u2019t want to ruin anything", "so you\u2019re not allowed to read newspapers online but your brother has full access to youtube? that\u2019s crazy i\u2019m sorry", "He is pretty good at telling my parents everything, so I doubt he\u2019s being groomed. (At his school a kid touched him inappropriately, on accident probably, and he told my mom that day) \n\nIf anything he\u2019s learned it from YouTube and the TV shows he SHOULD NOT be watching", "its all well and good that you love your mum and brother. but the way they are behaving, *they don't seem to love you*. loving someone does NOT give them a pass to abuse you in any way. \n\nwould you want someone else to live with/put up with those things happening to them? a close friend for example? i somehow doubt it - so you shouldnt be willing to for any reason hand out passes on what's happening just because its happening to you!!\n\non another note, you have the patience of a saint to have put up with this as long as you have. i would've become very violent very quickly if this sort of behaviour had been aimed at me. you ***ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS*** have the right to defend yourself.", "This is wrong on some many levels as is, and isn't correct in ANY situation, however even more so because the boy in question IS 6!!!! That'd literal illegal my guy", "I\u2019m not allowed to talk to people online (oh well, I\u2019m already the bad kid\u2026) \n\nHe also can play R rated games but I can\u2019t because I \u201cunderstand what\u2019s happening\u201d whereas he apparently doesn\u2019t. I wanted to play a game where you\u2019re a cowboy, literally just to ride the horse and camp, but because he\u2019s 6 he can but I can\u2019t. (Per my brothers words, because I\u2019m a girl) \n\nHe\u2019s the golden child, and a boy \ud83d\udc80", "Five bucks says grandpa is doing something to the 6yo. It\u2019s extremely unlikely to have a kid that age act this way without something else going on", "Yes but at 6 there should be parental controls on YouTube and the TV and your parents shouldn't be allowing him on the internet unsupervised and without checking his viewing history. Teaching how to navigate the internet safely is so important. \n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you but something is grossly amiss with your parents - their attitude to both you and to your brother's behaviour. I would report it.", "I\u2019m a massive introverted person, and take after my moms \u201ccare for everyone no matter what\u201d attitude\u2026\n\nMy mom I do know loves me, she\u2019s just super stressed trying to keep the peace between everyone, her mom is extremely sick right now, my stepdad isn\u2019t amazing, I\u2019m stuck at home 24/7 with a chronic illness (it\u2019s under control, I\u2019m just always asleep) and brother is a handful. I can\u2019t blame her for not being the best mom ever. Brother I think does care, he just doesn\u2019t know how to behave. Covid messed him up, he didn\u2019t get to be around anyone his age until recently. It\u2019s not an excuse, but they do have their good moments, even if they had outweigh them", "She needs to knee him right in \u201cthe safety deposit box\u201d", "I just don\u2019t want to hurt him, since even though he\u2019s a menace I do love him. Thankfully I\u2019m 98% sure grandpa left him alone, and the worst thing my grandpa did was rubbing my legs and upper thighs in my sleep (and trying to get into my bathroom while I showered) \n\nHe never was around my brother, and I did my best to keep his attention away from him. But I guess you never do know", "No it wont, doorstops are not a security device, they can be easily moved. I\u2019m honestly curious how you think a doorstop is going to work in this situation.", "I tried to set up a KIDS account for him, he threw a fit because his normal stuff wasn\u2019t there and it was mostly craft or animal vids. I just gave up after the 3rd attempt", "I'm sorry to be this harsh but it has to be said: she doesn't love you if she allows you to be sexually harassed and feel constantly unsafe in your own home. Stop making excuses for the people who keep hurting you and traumatizing you at literally every turn. \n\nCan't you see you deserve a million times better than this? Don't you understand you deserve to feel safe?", "your own life, per your description, isn't all sunshine and lollipops either, but you aren't taking it out on your family. and it doesn't really sound like your mum is trying to keep the peace, so much as just telling you to suck it up so the household is more peaceful. they're not the same thing. consider asking your mother if she'd be fine with your stepfather behaving as your brother is. or a male your own age. your brother is very young, and i do think people are right that at that age its more likely he's been explosed to abuse himself than that he's doing it of his own thought, but i am given to understand that six year olds do understand something about boundaries. \n\nregardless of why he's doing it, the behaviour is predatory and abusive no matter the age of the person its coming from - you have every right to want to want to be safe from him trying to look up your shirt or from stabbing your ankles or whatever else he's doing/trying to do. a parent should not forsake one child's wellbeing in favor of another's.", "OP, please talk to a responsible adult about this. I'm worried about you, but I'm also worried about your brother. This is _not_ normal behavior for a six years old. He needs help (and as a result, so do you) and he's not getting it. Think of this as doing something that's good for both of you.", "So, instead of protecting yourself and possible future victims, you're going to protect your abuser and his personal enabler. Okay. Great.", "Jfc, that\u2019s really not the time to play down what grandpa did.", "A wedge doorstop will work, and they're cheap, portable and cause no damage to the door. This is assuming the door opens into the room, which most bedrooms do.", "I guess i just feel guilty for stuff I did (nothing crazy, just being a moody teen or going against their wishes) so I feel like maybe I deserve this in a way, which I know is dumb, but if I make their lives easier by just settling, maybe it\u2019s for the best.", "I\u2019ve asked her that, \u201cwould it be ok if a grown man did this to me?\u201d Or \u201cif someone at school did this to me would it be ok\u201d and she just says \u201che\u2019s 6\u201d and that\u2019s really it. My therapist used to always say \u201cwait let me guess, he\u2019s 6\u201d whenever I complained about my brother, because of how much she said it. (I don\u2019t see her anymore because my mom didn\u2019t like her) \n\nHe\u2019s definitely been exposed to bad stuff, through YouTube, but I can\u2019t fix that either because he flips over it", "I\u2019ll try and discreetly bring it up with my dad next time I see him, but it may be awhile", ">Okay. Great. \n\nShe's a fifteen year old girl dealing with sexual harassment from a child and parents who enable it. Its gross to pull the 'what about future victims??' In general but moreso here. She's asking for help. Don't be a jerk.", "My grandpa is a pretty broken man, which I know I shouldn\u2019t be defending him, but at the end of the day he\u2019s family, even if he\u2019s horrible family. \n\nShould he have ever laid a hand on me? No. But he still helped my mom pay bills when she couldn\u2019t, and gave my brother tons of gifts for holidays. I can\u2019t blame him entirely when he did so much good for them"]}
