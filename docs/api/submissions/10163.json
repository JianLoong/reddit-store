He also has recently started trying to look at me when I change or use the bathroom, which my mom says is fine because he\u2019s a boy and 6, but if he does this to anyone who ISNT family, he\u2019s going to get in trouble. \n\nRecently I was in a large t-shirt (I wear baggy shirts instead of pajamas) and was just going to the kitchen to grab something to eat before going back to my room, where my door was closed. The shirt went to my knees, so it wasn\u2019t like I was in a crop top and nothing else. He tried to get under my shirt, to look at me. I told him to stop, and held him back. He kept shoving at me, and wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\nMy mom says it\u2019s my fault for not putting on \u201creal clothes\u201d but I literally was going 20 feet to grab a bag of chips, and I feel like I shouldn\u2019t been scared to leave my room without \u201creal clothes\u201d in my own house. \n\nI said \u201cstop being creepy and trying to look at me.\u201d The other day, because I had it, he was naked and dancing in front of my room, since he opened the door, and kept trying to look under my dress (I had gone out earlier) my mom got mad and said I was being cruel and never to call him creepy because I don\u2019t know \u201cwhat it\u2019s like for guys to be creepy\u201d\n\nHe also has been saying I can\u2019t do things anymore such as play Xbox or go out with friends because \u201cI\u2019m a noob girl and he\u2019s a pro hacker boy\u201d (I\u2019m not kidding these are his exact words) and my mom doesn\u2019t stop him. I\u2019m sick of him being sexist, even if he\u2019s 6.\n\nIn my eyes, 6 is more than old enough to know that it\u2019s wrong to try and look at women weirdly, dance naked (and inappropriately, he KNOWS what he\u2019s doing) and to be rude when I\u2019m not doing anything to him. \n\nAITA for calling him that and not being more \u201cunderstanding\u201d since he is only 6?", "created_utc": 1676595836, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1146ki0/aita_for_calling_my_brother_creepy_and_not/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I grew up with my younger brother being just a measly two years behind me. We shared a room for YEARS and he never tried to do any weird shit like this, and I almost always only wore a shirt and underwear to bed, and often around the house if it was near bedtime. They shouldn't be policing your body and he shouldn't be acting that way either, especially at 6. He learned it somewhere.", "Your parents are allowing you to be harassed.

His actions are inappropriate no matter what his age is.  He needs to understand personal space, consent, and keeping his own clothes on and your parents are failing in there job by not teaching him these things.", "NTA. My nephew tried to do the same to me and a few other ladies. All it took was getting a knot snatched in his tail once and he never did it again. Because he learned that such behavior will not be tolerated.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s six, his parents should be teaching him boundaries and respect. As it is, he\u2019s a growing creep. \n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA, your parents should be teaching him to respect other people's boundaries and that what he's doing is inappropriate. Even if he doesn't realise what he's doing your parents need to teach him these behaviours are wrong or it's going to cause even more issues in the future. Your parents are massive AH for not disciplining or correcting him, and also for saying it's your fault. They sound toxic af and it's most definitely not your fault that they're enabling this behaviour, you should be able to feel comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. This is all wholly inappropriate behavior being dismissed and excused under \"boys are all creepy, boys will be boys\" nonsense. Your parents are failing spectacularly, and dare I say you should report it to proper authorities. Let them get a visit from children's services and see how they defend it.", "You\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m sorry your parents are not protecting you. Your brother may not understand the sexual nature of what he\u2019s doing bc of his age, but he certainly understands that you do not like what he\u2019s doing to you. \n\nDo you have any trusted family members who can help you? A grandparent or aunt/uncle (or your father?) who\u2019d care if you told them your brother keeps trying to look at your private parts and your parents won\u2019t stop him?", "NTA. 6 is in kindergarten which means he is way too old to be hanging out naked. Sounds like he may have issues your parents are too lazy to deal with.", "Nta. Nor is your brother since he doesn't know any better.

She should be protecting you, not raising him to turn into a sex offender! This kid's going to grow up thinking this is okay. Your mom needs to get her head out of her ass and start being the parent you both need. What a disgusting reaction. \n\n>I change or use the bathroom, which my mom says is fine because he\u2019s a boy and 6, but if he does this to anyone who ISNT family, he\u2019s going to get in trouble. \n\nNo, it isn't! She's helping to raise a creep. It doesn't matter how old he is! His father needs to teach him how to act around others and teach him to respect boundaries. \n\nI hope you can get out of there as soon as possible. Was your mom always this toxic or does she just love her stepkid more? Are there other family or friends you can stay with?", "NTA. You're right, this behavior is ridiculous and your parents should be stopping it", "NTA. But this is concerning as sexulized behavior is one of the warning signs of sexual abuse in children.", "Your parents definitely need to take this situation more seriously cause this behavior will just continue into his adulthood. Your stepdad is immature, treating you differently just because you're not his child, extremely toxic. I hope you get away from these people and find happiness.", "OP I think you need to talk to authorities or a trusted adult. Please get out of there.", "NTA, but it's your parents who are AHs not your brother who is a creep. All kids are different and a lot of 6 year olds act like that and need to be corrected. It's not a sexual thing for them, just a combo of curiosity and finding it fun to get reactions out of people.\n\nBoys especially seem to be more likely to get naked, probably because people get more freaked out about a little girl stripping in front of adults and stop it when they're much younger. But 6 really is an age where they should be stopping him.", "Nta. Your brother doesn\u2019t respect you and your boundaries. Not only that but your parents are enabling this behavior by not correcting him. Gives me \u201cboys will be boys\u201d vibes.", "NTA. Start recording him. Every time he is inappropriate, violent, etc., record it. Save them on the cloud or send them to an email on you have access to so even if your parents take your phone it's recoverable. Show your parents & tell them that if this doesn't stop you are telling a trusted adult or a mandatory reporter. This behavior does not stop on it's own without consequences & if he continues he will turn into one of those \"but if she didn't want it why was she dressed that way\" dudes. For your safety & the safety of every person he comes into contact with once he hits puberty, this behavior needs to be nipped in the bud.", "NTA. Based on how your family treats your grandfather's actions as normal, there is a chance your brother is also being abused. Imo you should contact a counselor from your school or CPS and tell them what is going on and ask that someone check with your brother to make sure he isn't being sexually abused. Let them know that your family does nothing to discourage this behavior and it makes you feel unsafe in your own home. Btw do you know if he acts this way in school/in public or is it just to you?\n\nIf he isn't being abused he might be doing it to get a reaction out of you. Unfortunately if that is the case the best way to discourage that behavior is to ignore it completely and pretend he doesn't exist when he is acting out. In cases like this the person wants attention no matter if it is positive or negative so you have to use your attention as a \"reward\" for whenever he isn't acting out. If he gets bored and walks away? Start talking to him like normal. But the instant he tries to act inappropriately again, he doesn't exist to you anymore. It can be really hard to keep consistent about this but just do your best.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work and you need a way to get away from him without violence you might try carrying a small squirt bottle of water around with you so whenever he tries something you can spritz him. That way you don't have to use physical force and normally people will instinctively use their hands to cover their face/eyes and back off, giving you the opportunity to get away from him.", "When a child that young is inappropriately sexual, there's a strong possibility it's the result of abuse. I'll bet child protective services would want to look into that.", "NTA and this 6 year old is going to have major problems if parents don't start teaching him appropriate behavior.", "Lord no. NTA.\n\nReport his behaviour and your parents to a teacher. \n\nKeep as much evidence as possible. Write the date, time, and what he/they did. \n\nIf you have a phone, film some of his antics (as long as he's fully dressed). \n\nSpend as much time as possible at the library or with friends if you can.", "NTA. Get yourself ready to get out of that household. Find a way to protect anything you consider valuable (a safe or lockable trunk) and keep your things in there to keep them away from the little brat. Locate and keep tabs on all your important documents (SS card, birth certificate, passport, transcripts). You may not be able to get them out of your parent\u2019s hands yet, but knowing where they all are and being able to get to them if necessary will help you immensely. Look for lock solutions that aren\u2019t permanent (door stops, etc.) for your door. Find a trusted adult (family member would be great, but any adult you can trust) that may be willing to help you with a safe place to go or with opening a bank account. \nIf you wanted to be petty, pick a time to walk around the house butt naked. When your mom and stepdad complain, tell them that they have no problem with [step-brother] doing it, and he\u2019s old enough to know better, so clearly it should be ok for you to behave the same. You could also tell them that you are well aware that you are the unwanted child that they have to put up with until you\u2019ve graduated high school (don\u2019t say until you\u2019re 18, because that will open you up to being kicked out on your 18th b-day), and the moment you leave for college they never have to worry about you darkening their doorstep again although they may be empty nester\u2019s at that point since [step-bro] will likely be in juvie by then since they refuse to teach him that no means no and he\u2019ll undoubtedly have SA multiple women by that time and the legal system will have hold of him.", "NTA. Yes he is 6 and little boys can get a bit obsessed with adults bodies (as can little girls - plenty of kids pull you shirt to look down). I\u2019ve experienced it a fair amount over the years. The difference is though, that in every case they were told no, by their parents and told that wasn\u2019t right and if they didn\u2019t stop their hands were physically moved or they were distracted with one of their toys etc. \n\nThe language and your parents\u2019 acceptance of his speaking to you like that isn\u2019t right - he might be too young to be considered truly creepy now but without your parents guidance he\u2019s well on the way to becoming a misogynist incel \u201cnice guy\u201d who feels entitled to women\u2019s bodies.", "NTA. You need to look into getting an Addalock for your bedroom. It goes in where the latch is, sticks out into your room and has a wedge that slides over it and will keep the door from opening. It's portable and requires no modification to the door. You can use it on your bedroom and if the little perv tries, use it on other doors. Bathroom for instance. One is pretty vulnerable while in the shower.\n\nThey also make child proof doorknob covers that slip on and require a good deal on hand strength to squeeze hard enough to turn the knob and not just spin the cover\n\nMy other advice would be to talk to your biodad and see if you could spend a weekend or two with him. Try and develop that relationship in hopes you could move in permanently. Your current situation is not healthy for you and I'm sorry you're stuck in it.", "NTA  I would discuss this with a trusted teacher at school. Let them call CPS because your stepbrother has some severe mental issue's going on. It is not normal for a six-year-old to be behaving like this. Home is supposed to be a safe place, and he's destroying that.", "This is more than a little boy being spoiled and misbehaving.  Something is very wrong and he is acting out.  Could your grandfather be molesting him?", "NTA your mom and your stepdad are raising a predator if they don\u2019t nip this in the butt somethings gonna happen in the future. Can you live with your dad can you tell your dad about the stuff I would honestly say that if they don\u2019t put a lock on your door and stop this behavior you\u2019re gonna go to other family members and tell them what\u2019s happening. Consequences be damned.", "NTA - You need to speak to someone at your school about this.  The fact your mom defends your grandfathers inappropriate behaviour towards you  as \"that's just how he shows love\" is seriously f-ed up.  \n\nNo wonder she sees no problem with what your brother is doing to you.  They're reinforcing your brothers bad behaviour by not punishing him. Unfortunately he's only going to get worse not better. They're raising a potential monster. He'll eventually start doing it to other girls at school if he isn't already and they're just too scared to say anything.", "YTA for thinking he is creepy but wanting to pawn a theoretical horse off on him once you out grow it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
