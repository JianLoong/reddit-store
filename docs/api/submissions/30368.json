You\u2019re taking away any lingering mystique or stigma. If it\u2019s not forbidden or an \u201cadult thing\u201d she\u2019s not allowed near/trusted with then it looses a lot of the appeal. \n\nI think you and your husband need to have a conversation about how you\u2019re going to introduce alcohol to your kids. She\u2019s already 16, if she hasn\u2019t had it with friends by now, then she will soon. And keeping it as some kind of forbidden fruit until she\u2019s 21 only makes it more likely she\u2019ll hide it from you rather than feeling comfortable sitting next to you every now and then sharing a glass of wine. \n\nBinge drinking is a real issue, especially in college, and a lot of it stems from how we treat alcohol as something that\u2019s to be hidden. \n\nMoreover, it\u2019s a little alarming that your husbands first reaction was to yell at you. We only have this scene to go on, but jumping straight to \u201cshe could get addicted\u201d from a single glass of wine shared with her mother, seems like either a huge reach or like there\u2019s something deeper behind it\n\nEdit: OP said in a comment below that husband\u2019s family has a history of substance abuse, so I understand why husband had such a reaction now. It must\u2019ve brought up a lot of painful memories that he wasnt expecting (since they previously hadn\u2019t let daughter have alcohol, presumably due to her age)", "NTA, everyone should experience alcohol first in a safe environment. At home with her mum watching a movie is perfect. A lot of her peers either are or will start drinking soon, underaged, at parties with other underaged kids and little to no supervision. It's not a good environment to be learning how alcohol affects judgement in, and if she's banned from it at home generally kids will seek it elsewhere because they want to know and they think they are super adult and ready for adult things. \n\n\nI understand his concern, but alcohol addiction doesn't just Happen - it's a bad coping method for problems that people become reliant on. Teaching her in a safe environment and being clear it's not something to have all the time, and can be bad for you if it is, is a good way to introduce her to it rather than just waiting for her to be old enough to buy it herself.", "NTA. This, to me, should be the only way kids are introduced to things like alcohol. That way, they're not drinking antifreeze in someone's basement. This will also teach her what moderation is. Obviously, don't let her drink all the time and definitely do not let her talk about it with friends. I've had friends who tried the \"my parents said its ok\" bs and trust me, you don't want that drama at your door. \n\nTalk to your husband, though. He was a teenager once doing stuff he was told \"no\" about. Tbh, I don't think kids can easily get addicted if they're under the right environment, but this is something you and your husband should come together about. His blowup was unnecessary, though, so do with that what you will.", "**Europe has entered the chat**\n\nNTA.\n\nFostering a healthy relationship with alcohol is the way forward.", "NAH. I used to live overseas, so the drinking age is lower there. 16 is perfectly fine to have a glass of wine. In fact, having a glass in front of a parent really takes the fun and mysticism out of drinking. You made it seem normal (because it is), which develops a healthier relationship with alcohol than not. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for giving your daughter wine. Nor is your husband an AH for getting mad about it. You guys just weren\u2019t on the same page. I\u2019m not married, but I\u2019d say it was just a miscommunication. My parents let me try wine and beer when I was around 8 years old. (Before people come for my parents, it was just a sip so I could taste them). I thought alcohol tasted pretty bad and I hardly drink now and I\u2019m 25.", "I'm from Europe, so we don't have the same laws, but you didn't do anything wrong, imho...\n\nIt shouldn't be an habit, but letting he TRY a little of wine here or there, in order to let her learn the different tastes, etc. is NOT a bad thing at all, and it's better than forbidding everything and let her discover it by herself when she'll be 21 and being able to give you -or her father- the middle finger...\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Teenagers need to learn about how alcohol makes them feel and how long it takes for the effects to creep up on them.  The safest way to do that is to let them drink in moderation at home so that they can learn how it affects them.  If you didn't do that your teenager would just start drinking spirits at a party and end up completely wasted because they wouldn't know how to handle it or what their safe limits were.", "Unmmmmmmmm yeah NTA, I have a sister and we're 13years apart. She was 16 when she had her first alcohol beverage that I served her myself at MY house. It is absolutely legal at least in Ontario for your underage child to consume a small amount of alcohol in her own family home with her parents. I believe allowing your kids to experience things even once stops them from doing things behind your back and they're less likely to be addicted to it, given I assume you're not going to encourage her to constantly drink...\n\nAlso I had my first drink at 16 as well with my own family and I've been drinking with them on occasions usually ice wines or during specific meals and I am fine. I enjoy drinking but by no means am I an alcoholic, and can't go a day without a drink. Please. Relax.", "As the parent NTA, it\u2019s important to teach kids about alcohol and drugs and having discussions like \u201cu r going to drink underage but please be smart, never drive or get in a car with a drunk friend, call me and tell me so i know u r safe and stay where u r\u2026.\u201d.\nYTA as a partner for not discussing it with your husband before allowing it to happen. I know it just came up but u should say maybe someday soon the kid could try some but not until we talk to dad about it kinda thing. \nEither way u arent really an asshole either way, just learning things the hard way like we all do.", "NTA Many other cultures allow children to drink wine with meals. It also allows you to teach her the responsibility of drinking alcohol. Sometimes when they learn about it at home, it\u2019s not such an enigma as it is with kids her age.", "NTA\n\nMy brother and I were younger than that when we had our first taste of alcohol. My mother and grandparents had to explain to my stepfather that they'd rather we sample their drinks at home rather than out with friends. At least I'd we drank at home they knew we were safe. \n\nA sip here or there from their drinks and wine, beer, or a wine cooler on New Year's. Neither of us really partied in our teens because of our exposure. It basically took away the fascination, or I'm doing something I shouldn't or whatever other excuse teens use. We were allowed to drink at home with the family, so we never felt the need to with friends. \n\nIf she knows she can occasionally do it at home, there really isn't a point to do it with friends where she can find herself in bad situations or get in trouble at home.\n\nEdit: The majority of my family is alcoholics and my mother and grandparents wanted us to learn we never had to be that way or go that far. It's about drinking responsibly. Which also led to us kids being DDs (designated drivers) for our drunk friends.", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.   Like others have said.  It\u2019s a safe environment and with her parent.  I wouldn\u2019t let her drink 12 bottles.  Lol but a glass every now and again is acceptable.  Italians let there kids have wine nightly with dinner.   Just don\u2019t advertise it.", "NTA\n\nAn occasional glass of wine at 16 is perfectly fine.  In some Mediterranean countries children are allowed a small glass of wine, usually watered down, with meals.  My mum followed this and by the time I was of legal drinking age in the UK (16 beer or wine with food and 18 for any alcohol anywhere), alcohol wasn\u2019t a big thing with me.  Allowing a small amount with meals when younger or in a safe environment has been shown to reduce binge drinking.", "NTA. Drinking age is just another arbitrary bs number. \n\nLegal drinking age is 16 where i\u2018m from. My parents started letting me have a bit of wine at about 13. Most of my underage drinking happened around my family in a safe environment, meaning i (mostly) knew what i could handle when i actually started going out and having drinks with friends. I\u2018m all for demystifying these things BEFORE the kid embarks on their own explorations secretly and may get themselves into unsafe situations.", "NTA, when I was 16 it was perfectly legal to drink beer and wine at 16 in my (Western) country. *And* we'd all drink at 14, and had our first drink with our parents even younger. While I admit this is not exactly ideal, my country actually has one of the lowest alcohol consumption pro capite out of prevalently non mulsim countries, and alcoholism/binge drinking as adults is also a lot less common than in countries where the legal drinking age is higher, so I really don't think fully prohibiting alcohol until 21 is the way. It's really important to learn how to drink properly, and this is a proper way of doing it.", ">He started shouting at me, asking why the hell I let her drink alcohol underaged, and said she could easily become addicted to it.\n\nNTA. She's not going to get \"addicted\" from one glass of wine. Shouting at you is not great behavior, to put it charitably, and is the reddest of flags.", "NTA\n\nMy view may be skewed by being in the UK. Here it\u2019s legal to consume alcohol in your own home from the age of 5 [source](https://www.gov.uk/alcohol-young-people-law)\n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s better to have teens try alcohol at home. They\u2019re gonna be curious and if you don\u2019t make it taboo or restrict/ban it then it\u2019s not going to be the big rebellious act for them to drink it elsewhere.\n\nBetter she has a small glass at home than an entire bottle at a party.", "NTA.  Controlled supervision introduction is best.  \nI drank wine with my mom since I was 14 on occasions.  \n\nGuess what?  Not an alcoholic.  And not addicted. \nI drink maybe once a month, and that's just because I wanted to spoil myself with a 4 pack of my favorite locally made stout.  Sooooo good.", "NTA - Yeah you should have probably discussed this before but I've found that parents who teach kids to drink responsibly more often have the kids that don't go crazy when they hit college.\n\nMyself and my husband are examples of that.  Husband was allowed to drink underage, never really got drunk.  Myself, couldn't drink around family til 21, went wild.  Actually tried alcohol by the time I was 13.  Seen this a lot.", "NTA. I grew up in a family that let me try alcohol in age-appropriate amounts and by 16 would definitely have a glass of wine with dinner with them sometimes. My mum also knew I drank at house parties but as long as I slept over or took transit home, it was fine. The logic was that I\u2019d get experience, learn to understand alcohol, and by not having to hide anything, I knew I could call my mum for help if I needed it without being afraid. Once I moved out, I could manage myself and my alcohol intake. \n\nMeanwhile a good high school friend grew up in a strict household, and went crazy with her drinking whenever she was out. Blacked out time after time and became an alcoholic. \n\nYou are doing parenting right by allowing her to experiment in a safe environment with safe amounts, and she will absolutely appreciate this when she\u2019s older.", "NTA, a supervised single glass of wine as an exception or with food is a fairly responsible way to introduce a 16 year old to responsible drinking.\n\nWhen I was 16 where I lived it was legal for me to go to caf\u00e9\u2019s and have a few drinks. Mayhem did not ensue.", "NTA. \n\nIf you lived practically anywhere in Europe, it would be part of every day life. \n\nIt\u2019s one glass of wine and you allowing her to partake takes away a lot of the mysticism surrounding alcohol.\n\nNeither of my kids are particularly interested in alcohol, I firmly believe that\u2019s because I allowed it for special occasions(when they were underage)", "EDIT: YTA given the fact that your husband lost his own father to alcoholism, so this is an obvious trigger for him that you should have discussed together.\n\nNTA. As a parent you have a choice - share some alcohol with your kids when they are curious, or have their first experience drinking be outside of your view and protection. It\u2019s understandable your husband is worried about his daughter and alcohol, but he completely overreacted by yelling at you. You deserve an apology from him, and would be in your rights to retract your prior apology which you made under duress.", "NTA.  Better to do it under your guidance than out with friends.   This, along with continued discussions about the family predisposition to addiction/alcoholism will go a long way towards helping her make good decisions and also shows her that she can come to you for anything. \n\nYour husband needs to realize this is hella better than what kids normally do.", "NTA \u2026 BUT this something both parents should be on the same page about before it happens. I don\u2019t disagree with the need to learn in a safe space but I can see why hubby was pretty stunned if you hadn\u2019t agreed to it. Alcohol is a big deal as\nMuch as we seem to have normalized it. What if you had walked in and your daughter was sharing a cigarette or a joint with your husband? You just need to be on the same page.", "Nta she's 16 and curious. If you don't introduce her to it she'll get it under unsafe circumstances.", "Soft yta because you and your husband should make those decisions together. It's good to guide your children in alcohol use when they're old enough, but you should have cleared it with her father first. I hope you can work this out between you.", "I'm going against the grain here but YTA. Not because you introduced her to wine, plenty of us would say that this is exactly the healthiest way to teach older kids to have a responsible relationship with alcohol before they leave home and are on their own. But she is underage and you have a coparent who this should have been discussed with. I think to deny them any input on a decision like serving alcohol to your minor child for the first time was a mistake worth apologizing for.", "NTA. I was allowed to have a glass of wine at Thanksgiving dinner with my family at 15. It's not like you were doing shots. Your husband overreacted.", "I started drinking beer with my dad/uncles around that age and I turned out fine. I actually recommend a teenager drinking with their parents opposed to their peers, definitely a lot safer.", "YTA for not discussing this with your husband.", "NTA.\n\nAlso outside of North America it is very common and not a big deal.", "Ur kids in high school. If she was already curious about it, chances are she would have tried it somewhere else. Probably at a party or with friends. At least here you were with her and were able to make sure she wasnt put in any danger and Im sure she now feels she can trust you more than she previously did. NTA", "NTA.\n\nDrinking age is a rather arbitrary cultural thing, and if you lived in Europe it would be seen as rather odd to have your first taste of alcohol as late as 16.", "NTA.\n\nMy parents let me have little tastes of wine from a young age and I did the same with my daughter. In many countries it's very common to let kids have tastes or even to given them a small glass of wine mixed with water. I remember seeing some research that this approach makes kids **less likely** to go crazy in college because they see it as a normal thing and not something to go wild on. So on the \"easily become addicted\" thing, I believe your husband is simply wrong.\n\nThe one lesson I would share is, Don't let a young kid take a taste from a fine wine glass. Kids tend to bite down on the glass when they are drinking. When my parents gave me my first taste of wine, I got a mouthful of glass. So word to the wise: Use a sturdy tumbler when serving wine to your toddler.", "YTA. This is a conversation to have with your PARTNER who is raising your children with you before it happens, not during.", "ESH.  He massively overreacted, but after a policy of being strict about alcohol, you flipped it without talking to him.", "Idk maybe something like that needed discussing first but I think NTA. Regardless he\u2019s overreacting completely. But if someone has a weird history with alcohol or with a loved one who has addiction issues it might be understandable.", "I\u2019m not sure where you are, but in UK you can only buy alcohol at 18+yrs old but can consume it in a private home between 5 and 17yrs old but it is not recommended due to the effect it has on developing brains.\n\nI personally would allow a 16 year old to have wine but only with a meal.  Simply because food will help mitigate the effects of the alcohol.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal, she\u2019s almost an adult and can surely get into it on her own if she wants. Nta", "NTA. Giving alcohol in general and wine specifically, forbidden glamor by going apeshit over it will totally backfire on your husband. Nothing magically happens to someone when they reach the age of legal drinking.

Mostly NTA though. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA toward your daughter. You are a parent and I think your stance is reasonable. It\u2019s good to introduce alcohol because it is around in high school too (may have to go looking for it - I was nerdy and reserved and didn\u2019t drink until senior year), and soon she\u2019ll be having some college aged people in her friend group, including people who may be predatory. This is a good time to teach her about alcohol and the effects of it, what a standard drink is (eg 5 oz of wine) and how easy it is to accidentally drink way too much (I would also suggest having a movie night where you make a tasty rum punch and pour her 2 units of alcohol into a solo cup, which will be near flavorless and probably be about 1/3 of a solo cup, and tell her it\u2019s 2 units of alcohol so she can see how easy it is to get in over her skis if she just fills a cup and drinks).  If a standard drink is 12 oz 5% ABV, teach her that a 16 oz can of hipster brew at 8% is 16/12 x 8/5 = 2.13 units of alcohol in one can.  A 4 pack of hipster brew is going to be 8.52 standard units of alcohol.  \n\nTeach her about the consequences of drinking and driving.  It\u2019s not about if she\u2019s \u201cusually a good kid\u201d - if she has even one drink, and then drives, there are very very severe consequences and it doesn\u2019t matter whether her or her friends or even you think it\u2019s a \u201cbig deal\u201d.  The law will come down on her and there will be long lasting consequences.  So she should absolutely never ever ever have even one drink and drive, especially before she\u2019s 21, but even after it\u2019s much safer to not drink and drive, and to have some rule like 1 unit of alcohol requires 2 hours after before driving.  So after 1 hipster brew that\u2019s 4 hours before driving.  \n\nAlso teach her about date rape drugs, and to always go with friends and have each others back, keep their eyes on drinks, only get drinks at the bar that you order and watch the bartender make or get a sealed drink like a bottle of beer.  \n\nYou were a bit of a Y T A to husband. You\u2019re one of two parents, and in general you also have an obligation to each other.  So if he says no alcohol ever no matter what, then you would be breaking a bit of an obligation to your partner. But you\u2019re doing it because you have a greater obligation to your daughter to make sure she\u2019s safe and grows into a competent adult that can take care of herself.

I\u2019m not a parent, but was recently in college and I think it\u2019s important to consider how quickly your daughter might be confronted with a home life where no alcohol is allowed/it\u2019s treated as a bit of a taboo vs college where she\u2019ll be confronted with it/have access to it quite easily. \n\nThat can feel a bit like whiplash. And learning healthy limits *now* with her mom and dad is a lot safer than her figuring it out on her own/with friends (who are just as new to it as her)\n\nOne way to start doing that is by using wine to make food, I used to make risotto (and beef bourguignon) with my mom around that age/younger, and felt quite proud and grown up that she was letting me make something with alcohol in it (even if it burns off lol)", "I come from a family of alcoholics on both sides and as a result basically don\u2019t drink.

He knew if he really wanted a drink at a special occasion or if friends were dining he could ask and I\u2019d give him a small amount. \n\nAs he became an older teen when his friends were getting blackout drunk and sneaking alcohol he wasn\u2019t. He also told me what was going on and that he didn\u2019t understand why they\u2019d want to drink till they were suck\u2026 \n\nKnowing he could talk to me and could have a beer (at 17 etc) if he asked me made all the difference. He drinks more alcohol than me, because I drink .5 glasses a year if that, but he\u2019s always had a healthy relationship to alcohol as a result of my choices in raising him. \n\nAbuse of alcohol isn\u2019t *just* about the substance. It\u2019s a coping mechanism used because we haven\u2019t been taught good emotional coping mechanisms, because of trauma with no support for processing, etc. Your husband\u2019s over the top emotional response and freak out to alcohol is going to do FAR more harm in that direction (I can\u2019t ever talk to my parents about alcohol or drugs or WWIII will break out, if I make bad decisions with alcohol telling my parents I need help will be worse than whatever is happening, and just him clearly not having his own coping mechanisms for processing those big feelings and fear meaning he\u2019s not paying any on to her). \n\nComing from a family with issues CAN have an impact on our genetics/physiology- I get drunk on half a glass of wine and if I don\u2019t ingest more am sober 20mins later - but most of what is passed down is trauma, no emotional processing tools and a lack of education on what to do when things are bad and hard. My mom also never drinks out of fear of becoming her father, but instead became addicted to gambling. I worked HARD to teach myself emotional processing and coping tools and in two of my very worst moments of life have WISHED I could just drink myself insensible, and then immediately told others that and got myself support because that\u2019s the kind of work it takes to break an addiction cycle. \n\nIf your husband REALLY wants to protect your daughter from his family legacy, the solution isn\u2019t never allowing her near alcohol and never teaching her a healthy respect for and relationship with it, it\u2019s therapy for him to process his trauma and fear and learn new and healthier tools he can share with her.", "How could you not think this was a worth a discussion with your husband first, even regardless of his past but especially because of it?

Either way, she is firmly TA in this scenario simply for not talking with him about it. I completely agree in her views of alcohol, her daughter should be exposed to alcohol in a safe environment.

Even if he has spent years in therapy and is handling his trauma in the most healthy way possible (sounds like he\u2019s not, but that is a separate discussion), surprising him with his daughter drinking a glass of wine would probably still trigger a trauma response.
