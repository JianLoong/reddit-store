Boy bye.", "NTA, and I do mean strictly NTA. Your BF is wrong, your parents are wrong, and your sister is wrong. You're a minor and it is your parents' job to keep you safe, which means that they have to parent their children in a way that they know it's not acceptable to play cruel \"pranks\" that have a non-trivial chance of harming other people. I put pranks in quotes because if the prankee doesn't think it's funny, only the pranker, it's not a prank, it's bullying. So your parents have a duty to make sure they're not raising a bully. That goes double for bullying that takes place when someone else is naked.\n\nSince your parents basically abdicated their responsibility to get her stop bullying you, I really don't see what other option you had here other than, I don't know, beating the shit out of her every time she did it until she stopped.\n\nI mean your options were basically Option A, you escalate and harm her to get her to stop. Option B, you don't do anything and you get hurt. Option C, you lie and pretend to get hurt so your parents will do their damn job. Option D, some magical thinking that you couldn't come up with at the time. You chose Option C and it's better than A or B, so I wouldn't feel bad.\n\nI don't see what else you could have done. And even if Option D existed, like your BF's suggestions, it's not your job to find it, you're a child. It's your parents' job to be a parent and not have to force their children to parent each other. Which is super typical of eldest daughters, by the way, where the parents just let the younger run wild because they're tired and the older one has been mistreated for so long she has no choice but to accept it.\n\nAnyway, don't feel bad for whatever passive-aggressive stuff you have to do to force your parents to parent and protect you (i.e. their jobs). If they didn't want you to lie, maybe they shouldn't have created a household where bullying goes unpunished.", "Don't ever apologize for coming up with clever solutions to problems. \n\nThis kind of prank could have seriously injured or killed you if you had slipped and hit your head on a hard surface. \n\nMaybe while the iron is hot you try to get that door lock fixed.", "NTA. Your parents are AH for not fixing the lock, your sister is the AH for being a dick. This all could have been avoided.", "NTA\n\nIt almost did happen.

Now you gotta worry about BF spilling the beans...", "Your parents ignored your concerns about your sister basically bullying you.  I think it was a brilliant solution.  NTAH.", "NTA. It's just a counter-prank. Sis shouldn't dish out what she doesn't want to come back on her with compound interest.", "NTA; you legitimately could've got hurt, you might be getting back at her but you're also making sure your safety isn't compromised over some shitty prank", "NTA - but I don\u2019t think your sister is that bad either. The assholes here are your parents.\n\nDon\u2019t do anything about their daughters dangerous prank but then she gets punished once you actually get injured?\n\nShit parenting, not surprising your sister does dumb shit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I fell and hit my hip hard enough to warrant a day or two off work. I lost my shit, too. Was there ever a puddle after that? Surprisingly, no. Guess they knew how to mop after all.", "Get a new boy friend", "NTA- Don't tell anyone else, and yeah, if your boyfriend cares more about your sister than you, time to find a new one.", "LOL NTA\n\nWell, you are a bit ... but too bad, so sad.", "NTA! but agree with others don't tell anyone else. Slipping in the bathroom is one of my biggest fears not for myself but for my family!", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is being mad goofy, I wouldn't say it's breakup material but it's disappointing.", "NTA! NTA! Don\u2019t listen to your boyfriend!! Your sister needs to learn her lesson!!", "Nah, you taught your sister a lesson not to fuck around or she\u2019ll find out", "NTA - and I can't believe I'm really saying this, but... don't come clean for at least a few years, possibly even longer or just never at all.\n\nIf you let them in on it now, they'll backpedal on the punishment and the putting a stop to it - and it would underminde your boundaries even more than they already are. It already took something actually happening (to their minds) for your parents to actually step up.\n\nStay safe - and don't tell them you lied. In this case, the lie is your one defense against the lack of care your parents showcased. It's sad that they made that necessary.", "NTA.\n\nWhat your sister was doing was dangerous and silly. You could have slipped, hit your head and been killed, and your parents should have told her not to do this sooner. \n\nYou simply gave your sister a small taste of what her dangerous pranks could have led to, had she continued.", "I guess ESH.\n\nYour parents should be repairing hte lock, your sister shouldn't be such an ass and you are abusing their trust and concern for your safety to force your parents to fight your battles for you.\n\nWas there really no other option for dealing with your sister, a doorstop would work, as would doing the same to her in return or 1000 other ways you might retalliate.\n\nEvery time someone fakes an emergency it makes it strains the response you might one day need to be safe.  Boy who cried wolf and all that.", "Fell and broke my leg in the shower. Needed plate and pins in my leg and ankle, on my ward of FOUR people, two others were in with broken backs due to falling in the shower. Hard NTA from me.", "Honestly, the boyfriend was right about the doorstop. But no you\u2019re NTA. What could\u2019ve happened was far far worse than what you acted out. And way more expensive. I\u2019m getting over a broken leg from an accident 7 mos ago. Still not healed. 10\u2019s of thousands of dollars and incredibly disruptive to whole family. If you had fallen and hit your head, you could\u2019ve had a concussion or worse. \n\nBathroom falls are a very common occurrence and because of that, bathroom designers spend many hours of schooling learning how to make bathrooms less dangerous. (My mother is an interior designer) Did you over play the fall? No. Will you tell your family ever? Maybe, maybe not.", "NTA\n\nI get what you mean*, this sort of shit is so fuckin annoying and it\u2019s seldom actually a \u201cprank\u201d\u2013 a prank means that everyone laughs at the end, if it\u2019s only the prank-puller laughing then it\u2019s bullying.\n\nThe bf is an idiot\u2013 \u201coh buh it\u2019s cruel to get her in trouble\u201d it\u2019s cruel to repeatedly put your sister in a vulnerable and dangerous position all for the sake of her own amusement. Let this be a lesson to the sister.\n\n*me dad randomly and loudly shouts the last notes of the Countdown tune when I\u2019m doing something. This type of shit is so fuckin annoying, walking on eggshells constantly, waiting for the next time these dumb \u201cpranks\u201d happen. Think I might take a leaf out of your book lmao\n\nEdit: that\u2019s also some ass parenting\u2013 they gave her _one_ verbal warning and then just abandoned the idea? \u201cWelp she\u2019s not gonna stop better make the other one deal with it\u201d??? Uh no??? \u201cStop trying to hurt your sister\u201d \u201cno\u201d oh well then\u201d the fuck are they on??? They waited until they thought you were actually injured by your sister\u2019s stupid antics, that is _far too late_ to be acting", "NTA.  100% best course of action given your parents' lack of action.  And your BF is a moron, don't listen to him.  Risking your safety for a laugh was cruel, you revenge was justified.", "NTA - Your boundaries were repeatedly crossed and no one cared enough to do something about that. What you did was smart and necessary, as it's very realistic to happen sooner or later for real if your sister were to keep doing this. Your bf has shown now that he as well, does not care enough about your boundaries to help you, because if there were so many better and simpler solutions, then why not bring those up sooner? \n\nAlso the solutions he offered, are not really solutions, as they don't do anything for your sister's behaviour. She would just move on to the next potentially dangerous thing to harass you with. What you did might actually impact her perspective on the matter as well.", "I actually really like showering in the dark, but I can reach the light switch from the shower. I\u2019ll turn my phone flashlight on and leave it on the counter so there\u2019s enough light to see, but I find the dark lighting soothing for my eyes.", "Lol, probably NTA. But the comments here r crazy. I get there\u2019s the meme of \u201creddit wants everyone to dump their boyfriends/husbands, but for something like this isolated remark is HILARIOUS advice \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nBut yea, fuck that. Play stupid games win stupid prizes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA also you turn off the lights when your bf is in the toilet for a couple weeks.", "NTA.\n\nand to reiterate from others, ditch the boyfriend, he's not worth holding onto if he can't understand that you were protecting yourself from injury.", "NTA sounds like it's time to consider a new bf.", "NTA. She could go in and turn off the lamp. Doorstop? LOL\nYour parents should fix the lock and your sister should have been punished either way before for potentially getting you hurt.\nYou did the right thing. While simulated, it was a believable scenario. People need to learn that innocent jokes in their mind can have potential not so fun consequences.", "Seconded, my nan fell in the bathroom, hit the sink and I believe either fractured or broke some ribs.(I was only 10 when this all happened) This started a long cycle of nan going into the hospital, getting slightly better, going home, going back in. Rinse, repeat until my mum finally got a call from the hospital that nan had passed overnight. The fall didn't kill her, but it started the dominos\n\nMy dad's side, he and his brothers make a point to regulary call their parents since they are 96 and very frail now.", "NZ has a series of ads from our public health insurer with common accidents. This scenario was one of them!\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/A8zVnErdPfE", "Nah. He erred, but on the side of kindness. Sounds like a keeper to me. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Totally agree. I fainted at the pool and hit my head on the tiled floor. Staff called an ambulance when I started blacking out and having convulsions. Ended up in A&E with concussion and a horrendous facial bruise. OP could have been killed if the slip was genuine. Her sister needed to learn this lesson.", "This. My partner will turn the light off when I'm in the bathroom, just to annoy me, but only ever for a few seconds, and only ever whilst I'm seated (on the toilet or in the bath for instance). He'll then turn it back on, we'll laugh, I'll pretend to flip him off and he'll leave me alone. That's a harmless prank. What OPs sister is doing is dangerous and she needs to be told to knock it off.", "Loved that show and remember that episode, pretty sure that was the one with Kelsey Grammer in it as the bad guy and dying ironically in the bathroom with a mai thai.", "Thia is how one of my managers died. Slipped in the shower getting ready for work", "So? A potentially injurious fall could kill or cripple his GF, and her parents are enabling this. What point does he have? That she should accommodate her bully and her enablers? He's not someone you want at your side during life trials.\n\nSometimes minor disagreements show major truths about a person.", "Yep, my friends dad had the same thing happen, we were gaming out and heard a loud thud and crash, he slipped and hit his head, he's paralyzed, it's scary knowing that could happen in the shower", "My best friend has seizures, and she'll call or text me every time she takes a shower and her husband or son isn't home. Just in case anything happens when she's in there. \n\nMy grandfather slipped in the bathroom and had to crawl down the stairs to get to a phone. He was very independent and resistant to using technology. He ended up losing a few fingers and toes since he had diabetes and had to live in an assisted living facility. This was back in the late 90s, and I still wonder if he had a cellphone, would things have been different.", "I fell getting out the shower years ago and managed to cut my leg, put one foot through the wall and slam my head between metal radiator and the metal bath quite hard. I had a mild concussion as well as some bruising and the cut to my leg. My ankle was thankfully just a mild sprain. And that was absolutely nobodies fault.\n\nThe bathroom I have now has the handles on the walls like old/disabled use and I\u2019m so damn grateful as my fibro has got worse and I\u2019m able to grip them to safely enter and exit bath (shower is over bath) plus our bath has a grip texture already on it so I don\u2019t slip", "I think I did something like this once, but I got in trouble for not actually being hurt (not in a bathroom) - but my brother did actually stop what he was doing because I scared him enough.", "They should have but they didn't. She has already almost fallen. Was probably freaked out when she did. It's better to let everyone think she was injured so they all learn a lesson. This is one time I believe that telling a lie is better in the long run.", "Frankly, they should just come standard. I think we underestimate how much accessibility devices help everyone.", "It sounds so bizarre the way her accident happened, like totally freak accident. \n\nIn the uk the showers are often above the bath and the bath is raised, so you step down out of the tub (I'm explaining as when we had american friends over they found this so weird so not sure if set ups in america are different to over here). \n\nSo the lights went out and she tried to step out and down and...misjudged it in the dark I guess?  The foot in the tub slipped pitching her forward and she tried to save herself by grabbing the shower screen. That swung and trapped her leg. So half her body went forward and her leg stayed where it was! She's got loads of other injuries like ligament and tendon damage but the big one was the pelvis. \n\nI mean, it was literally a freak accident. But it proves that freak accidents can and do happen.", "How do you know? I don't agree - but I'm nowhere near perfect at finding them. Edit: I mean, I saw your explanation, but the account leaves top-level unique responses."]}
