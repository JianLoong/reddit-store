Our bathroom is weirdly long so I\u2019ll have to get out of the shower walk to the light switch turn it back on then get back to the shower. It also leaves a mess of water for me to clean up after wards. And I can\u2019t keep her out because the lock is broken.  My parents gave her a verbal warning once but when she continued to do it there was no real punishment. They just told me to just put up with it and she\u2019ll eventually get bored and stop. \n\nWell that didn\u2019t work because she continued this for three weeks. One day as I was getting out the shower to turn the lights back on, I almost slipped and fell. This gave me an idea, I waited until the next time she tried to pull this prank again. When she came to turn the lights off I knocked all the stuff off the shower caddy, the bottles on the tub edge and the towel rack. I also pulled the shower curtain down and quickly laid on the ground. My mother burst in turned the lights on and saw the mess plus me on the ground. She ran up to me and asked if I was ok, I said no I slipped in the dark and hurt myself pretty bad. \n\nAfter mom and dad helped me get settled they turned on my sister. They yelled at her, took her phone and grounded her for the rest of the week. She was also forced to apologize to me and promise to never do it again. When I told my boyfriend about this he said what i did was cruel. Not only did i unnecessarily scare my parents my sister got punished for something that didn\u2019t happen. He says I could have just gotten a doorstop for the bathroom or a lamp so it\u2019s not as dark. \n\nI feel what I did was justified since me getting injured was something that could actually happen.

She honestly should have been punished a long time ago. What she was doing was dangerous and mean.", "NTA. What you said was pretty much ignored until you did this. This also sounds really dangerous. You could actually have gotten injured if your sister kept this up", "NTA. Consider it like pranking your sister. A prank with a beneficial outcome because what your sister was doing was dangerous.", "NTA. You are right, it WAS a disaster waiting to happen, you just showed her a realistic outcome of her thoughtless prank. That grounding punishment should have happened the first time she did, but I guess your parents are slow.", "NTA. So you pranked the prankster.  TBH, that\u2019s the punishment she she should have gotten the next time she did it after your parents told her to stop.  You could have been seriously injured if you had fallen.", "So your boyfriend would rather you actually slip and break an arm or something.   Because eventually something would happen that caused you injury.   \n\nShe got punished for all the times she turn off the light and didn't get punished like she should hve.

Bit sneaky but perfectly feasible, and clearly effective", "NTA - it could have easily continued until you fell and hurt yourself for real.

This kind of injury could likely happen and could result in graver consequences. You were able to put a stop to it by turning the prank around back to your sister. If your bf thinks this is cruel, but doesn\u2019t think what your sister is doing is cruel, he prioritizes shits and giggles over your wellbeing and safety. Boy bye.", "NTA, and I do mean strictly NTA. Your BF is wrong, your parents are wrong, and your sister is wrong. You're a minor and it is your parents' job to keep you safe, which means that they have to parent their children in a way that they know it's not acceptable to play cruel \"pranks\" that have a non-trivial chance of harming other people. I put pranks in quotes because if the prankee doesn't think it's funny, only the pranker, it's not a prank, it's bullying. So your parents have a duty to make sure they're not raising a bully. That goes double for bullying that takes place when someone else is naked.\n\nSince your parents basically abdicated their responsibility to get her stop bullying you, I really don't see what other option you had here other than, I don't know, beating the shit out of her every time she did it until she stopped.\n\nI mean your options were basically Option A, you escalate and harm her to get her to stop. Option B, you don't do anything and you get hurt. Option C, you lie and pretend to get hurt so your parents will do their damn job. Option D, some magical thinking that you couldn't come up with at the time. You chose Option C and it's better than A or B, so I wouldn't feel bad.\n\nI don't see what else you could have done. And even if Option D existed, like your BF's suggestions, it's not your job to find it, you're a child. It's your parents' job to be a parent and not have to force their children to parent each other. Which is super typical of eldest daughters, by the way, where the parents just let the younger run wild because they're tired and the older one has been mistreated for so long she has no choice but to accept it.\n\nAnyway, don't feel bad for whatever passive-aggressive stuff you have to do to force your parents to parent and protect you (i.e. their jobs). If they didn't want you to lie, maybe they shouldn't have created a household where bullying goes unpunished.", "Don't ever apologize for coming up with clever solutions to problems. \n\nThis kind of prank could have seriously injured or killed you if you had slipped and hit your head on a hard surface. \n\nMaybe while the iron is hot you try to get that door lock fixed.", "NTA. Your parents are AH for not fixing the lock, your sister is the AH for being a dick. This all could have been avoided.", "NTA\n\nIt almost did happen. Hope the lesson sticks.", "NTA\n\nBut you shouldn't have said anything to anyone about it.  Now you gotta worry about BF spilling the beans...", "Your parents ignored your concerns about your sister basically bullying you.  I think it was a brilliant solution.  NTAH.", "NTA. It's just a counter-prank. Sis shouldn't dish out what she doesn't want to come back on her with compound interest.", "NTA; you legitimately could've got hurt, you might be getting back at her but you're also making sure your safety isn't compromised over some shitty prank", "NTA - but I don\u2019t think your sister is that bad either. The assholes here are your parents.\n\nDon\u2019t do anything about their daughters dangerous prank but then she gets punished once you actually get injured?\n\nShit parenting, not surprising your sister does dumb shit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
