Boy bye.", "NTA, and I do mean strictly NTA. Your BF is wrong, your parents are wrong, and your sister is wrong. You're a minor and it is your parents' job to keep you safe, which means that they have to parent their children in a way that they know it's not acceptable to play cruel \"pranks\" that have a non-trivial chance of harming other people. I put pranks in quotes because if the prankee doesn't think it's funny, only the pranker, it's not a prank, it's bullying. So your parents have a duty to make sure they're not raising a bully. That goes double for bullying that takes place when someone else is naked.\n\nSince your parents basically abdicated their responsibility to get her stop bullying you, I really don't see what other option you had here other than, I don't know, beating the shit out of her every time she did it until she stopped.\n\nI mean your options were basically Option A, you escalate and harm her to get her to stop. Option B, you don't do anything and you get hurt. Option C, you lie and pretend to get hurt so your parents will do their damn job. Option D, some magical thinking that you couldn't come up with at the time. You chose Option C and it's better than A or B, so I wouldn't feel bad.\n\nI don't see what else you could have done. And even if Option D existed, like your BF's suggestions, it's not your job to find it, you're a child. It's your parents' job to be a parent and not have to force their children to parent each other. Which is super typical of eldest daughters, by the way, where the parents just let the younger run wild because they're tired and the older one has been mistreated for so long she has no choice but to accept it.\n\nAnyway, don't feel bad for whatever passive-aggressive stuff you have to do to force your parents to parent and protect you (i.e. their jobs). If they didn't want you to lie, maybe they shouldn't have created a household where bullying goes unpunished.", "Don't ever apologize for coming up with clever solutions to problems. \n\nThis kind of prank could have seriously injured or killed you if you had slipped and hit your head on a hard surface. \n\nMaybe while the iron is hot you try to get that door lock fixed.", "NTA. Your parents are AH for not fixing the lock, your sister is the AH for being a dick. This all could have been avoided.", "NTA\n\nIt almost did happen.

Now you gotta worry about BF spilling the beans...", "Your parents ignored your concerns about your sister basically bullying you.  I think it was a brilliant solution.  NTAH.", "NTA. It's just a counter-prank. Sis shouldn't dish out what she doesn't want to come back on her with compound interest.", "NTA; you legitimately could've got hurt, you might be getting back at her but you're also making sure your safety isn't compromised over some shitty prank", "NTA - but I don\u2019t think your sister is that bad either. The assholes here are your parents.\n\nDon\u2019t do anything about their daughters dangerous prank but then she gets punished once you actually get injured?\n\nShit parenting, not surprising your sister does dumb shit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
