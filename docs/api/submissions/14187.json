I think your feelings are valid, and it sounds like you made a genuine mistake. But in my humble opinion (and apologies if I\u2019m being presumptuous), it sounds like you and your wife might benefit from an honest conversation about the whole ring situation. It\u2019d be a shame for something so small to cause unnecessary bitterness in your marriage.", "NTA it was unintentional, does she not wear hers bc she\u2019s afraid of damage? Could she wear like a silicone band 24/7 and save the wedding ring for special occasions?? I don\u2019t blame you for being a little hurt, I would be too. Offer to buy her a simple silicone band even just to cover up the tattoo, she should WANT to cover it up I would think. \ud83e\udd14", "NTA and honestly I would be very ticked if my partner rarely wore OUR wedding ring but didn't bother to remove or cover her tattooed ring from her marriage to someone else. Her having the audacity to call you out when your merely forgot ONCE is a red flag. I wouldn't feel inclined to wear that ring every day if I were you, maybe more like on special occasions - match her energy and see how she reacts. If she has an issue with it, show her a mirror.", "My partner passed before we married, and I had his first initial tattooed on the inside of my finger. If I ever decide to marry in the future, I will wear ring and it will be covered. I understand your discomfort because it seems like it's an actual ring tattooed on to her finger. What is her response when you tell her about your discomfort seeing her ring from her previous marriage? Has she offered a compromise to get it tattooed over? I do find it hypocritical on her part that she doesn't wear a wedding ring but then gets on you when you didn't wear it one day.\n\nNTA", "INFO: Did she get tattoo wedding bands in her previous relationship precisely because she doesn\u2019t like wearing jewelry/rings or because she\u2019s afraid she\u2019ll misplace it? It just seems notable that before she chose an option where she wouldn\u2019t have to wear a physical ring, and now also seems to not want to wear her ring. Have you two had a conversation about this and her feelings on wedding bands?", "NTA and your response was very fair. Same rules for each of you.", "NTA whatsoever. why isn\u2019t she getting her tattoo removed? regardless, she\u2019s not wearing her\u2019s. stones/glasses houses. \n\nalso i normally hate these types of comments but it\u2019s weird how quick she was to be suspicious of you leaving your ring at home. anyway she is projecting/feeling guilty for something\u2026?", "I would say no. As someone who rarely wears theirs. Mostly because of my job. I never get upset at my wife when she doesn\u2019t wear hers for whatever reason. I can\u2019t expect her to do something I don\u2019t. If she expects you to wear it all the time she should have the same expectation about wearing hers. Honestly the simple fact she has the tattoo she should be wearing her ring to cover it up.", "NTA.  Part of her journey my ass.  She is willfully ignoring how the constant reminder and showyness of her first marriage coupled with the fact that she simply can't be bothered with the symbol of *your* marriage is a slap in the face to you and your marriageto each other.  Her reaction to you forgetting your ring *one time* is ridiculous.\n\nThe very least she could be willing to do is alter her ring tattoo so it does not resemble a ring.  She sounds incredibly insensitive at best and exceptionally self-absorbed and hurtful to most, and I won't even say what she sounds like if you want to think the worst.", "You're NTA. This is totally a double standard. If she isn't going to wear her ring for whatever reasons she may have, she should not be questioning you if you don't wear your ring.", "NTA. Her double standard is weak.", "NTA", "NTA", "I feel like your wife\u2019s reaction, while hypocritical, is more a reaction to your change in behavior\u2014 ie forgetting to wear the ring. She knows you like wearing it, so it might seen suspicious to her that you took it off. \n\nHave you asked her about getting a new ring tattooed for your marriage instead of a physical ring?", "Info, ages? This sounds too immature a conversation for marriage. You married her, with the tattoo. Get the hell over it.", "INFO: why do you habitually remove your ring when you go to bed? I don't get that.\n\nThe only time I can recall taking mine off is a few years ago when I injured that finger and it began to swell -- figured I'd better get the ring off while I still could. It's a part of me. I felt awkward as hell without it.", "YTA\n\nThere's no double standard here... yet. She questioned you because you suddenly changed your habit, not because you didn't wear the ring specifically. Then you started questioning her even though she didn't change any of her habits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What\u2019s her reasoning for not wanting to wear it?", "NTA considering she got pissed off at you for forgetting to put yours on, whereas she only puts hers on for special occasions. Her reaction to it was weird.\n\nI get not wanting to get laser tattoo removal because it hurts, but you could always wear your new wedding ring over it.", "NTA. I\u2019d be pissed about the wedding ring tattoo who wants to see a permanent reminder of a past marriage. She then doesn\u2019t wear the ring for your marriage and has the nerve to question you for not wearing your ring, yeah she\u2019s a massive hypocroite.", "I wouldn't stay married to someone who wouldn't wear their ring. Id also want them to have that tattoo removed.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife not wearing her wedding rings is a valid reason to be annoyed. Now, if its because it doesn't fit, or she works a job its a hazard, this is different.\n\nBut if its just for no reason, yeah, she's an AH.", "INFO: Is the tattooed band from a marriage where her previous spouse died or just a divorce?", "NTA. If she doesn't wear hers, she has no right to demand you wear yours.", "I have a question:  \n\n\nDid they divorce, or did her first spouse pass away?", "NTA big double standard, and I don't like that she won't have a conversation with you about it, the tattoo, rings in general, etc. My SO and I are always taking our rings off and on. No judgment from either person as to why or how long. We'll joke about being each other's side piece if we notice it, but it's no big deal for us. And that's because we've talked about it and are on the same page about it.", "NTA I think I understand her perspective though. Wearing the ring is important to you. So you not wearing it feels significant. Now that is bs you're only human but imagine that is how we felt. As people it's often easy to these things accidents when they are our own actions but assign intent to other people.\n\nThat said her not wearing the ring is clearly a big deal for you. You guys need to work something out that makes you both feel loved and appreciated. Resentment is a relationship killer and your feeling this every day when you put your ring on.", "NTA.  I would say it's reasonable for both of you to have the same expectation of wearing a ring. My husband and I both wear silicone rings. He finds it easier at the gym and I have sensory issues (I don't even wear earrings anymore).", "Tried to have a conversation.  She said the tattoo was part of her life journey. No real response to why she doesn't wear our ring.", "I mentioned maybe getting it removed once and she replied that it was part of her life journey. End of conversation...", "She's never mentioned an aversion to wearing rings, owns quite a few and recently asked for an eternity ring.", "Lasering off tattoos hurts MUCH more than getting the tattoo. I have ink. I would NEVER go thru that laser process", "I get not wearing rings if they are a safety issue at work. Not the case here though.", "Indeed I did and if she wore her wedding ring and didn't have an issue with me forgetting to wear mine ONCE I wouldn't have brought it up.", "I have high blood pressure and get quite hot at night.

Kind of just ignore ores it if I bring it up.", "Divorce", "Based on the fact that she got the original ring tattooed, I\u2019m willing to bet she just doesn\u2019t like wearing rings (and it may not be more complex then that). \n\nHowever, if I were in her shoes I\u2019d probably get that original tattoo removed or reworked at least (depending on the tattoo). Or at the very least not hound my husband for forgetting his ring one time. (I agree with NTA btw).", "It's a part of her life journey that is a constant reminder she was previously married to someone else, and since she doesn't wear her wedding ring, its very visible, every day.  It's like she's still wearing the other guys ring instead of yours.  Fuck her life journey, I don't blame you for being hurt.\n\nShe needs to either:\n1) get the tattoo removed\n2) get something tattooed over it\n3) Wear her ring from you", "Sounds like something you could (gently) follow up on, at some point. Maybe just focusing on your own wedding rings and leaving the tattoo out of it since she already addressed that part.", "She's TA. What does that say about her life journey with you then? Sounds like she doesn't value your relationship.", "Can you get a tattoo to match hers?  Maybe she feels since she has a \"ring\" on she doesn't need to wear her new wedding ring?", "That is very strange. I think you two need to have an open discussion about why she is unwilling to wear her wedding ring. Not in a judgmental or accusatory way, just from a place of curiosity and wanting to understand.\n\nSince you wear it all the time I suppose she thought it odd that you didn\u2019t wear it that day, but that doesn\u2019t warrant her grilling you, and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong by just forgetting. It also comes off as hypocritical from her end since she does not wear hers.

You\u2019re not in the wrong, you\u2019re right", "Well that on top of getting mad at you over not wearing yours isn\u2019t right.

There'd be 3 people in the world with that design...", "Ha! Hope the conversation stays friendly and productive!", "Op sorry I must have missed that, maybe she wanted to try and start wearing one? (I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s wearing it over the tattoo). \n\nEither way you\u2019re definitely not wrong here, she does not have a right to get upset at you not wearing your ring one time while she not only early wears hers, but also still has a tattoo of a ring from a previous marriage. She\u2019s missing both legs to stand on here.", "That doesn\u2019t mean she likes wearing a ring all the time, though.

It is completely unacceptable for her to start abusing you for forgetting to wear a ring.\n\nNTA\n\nIf she was a decent and caring person she would be apologising for that first. Then you can make some decisions about rings.  Maybe the best is \"stop carrying on like children about rings\".\n\nShe is the asshole here for her outburst.  You both, however, seem to have some really strange conflict about rings on a few levels.  Why  are they so important.  Its strange.  It is like you are both pretending they are important and not important, and then arguing over it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: reading more of your comments, you are also a bit intense about the whole ring thing.  My wife and I don't even have rings.  We decided buying houses was better."]}
