He does a lot around our son and I usually feel like we\u2019re doing an equal amount of work at home. But he does not do mental labour. I am the planner, and it\u2019s a bit of a thorn in my side sometimes. \n\nOn Saturday afternoons we normally have a play date. Our friends who we see were at another family members house and invited us to join them. The plan was to be there roughly around 2. Our toddler usually naps from 12-2 ish like clockwork. We will wake him up if he sleeps late so that he can get to sleep at night. The place we were supposed to go is maybe 30 mins away so they knew we\u2019d be a little late. I relayed all this info to my husband. \n\nI was not actually supposed to go with them because I had an appointment at the same time. I was excited to have an afternoon to myself. However, I get back from my appointment at 3 and my husband is still home and toddler is still sleeping. He had gone down at 12 so had been sleeping 3 hours. I asked my husband what was going on and why they hadn\u2019t left yet. He looked all confused saying that the baby was asleep. I asked him why he didn\u2019t wake him so they could go. I guess he either didn\u2019t realize it was 3 or forgot when he went down for his nap.  \n\nI got mad and told him that he was selfish. We couldn\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house 2 hours after they invited us to be there with a groggy toddler who had slept too long. And now I was loosing my afternoon off and probably going to have to deal with a toddler who won\u2019t sleep later. \n\nI feel a little bad because he does take good care of our son.

They are with a friend of my husband and his children. Both our families agreed to schedule an ongoing playdate Saturday afternoon, but it\u2019s flexible if people can\u2019t make it.

I think making your husband feel bad over a slip up pushes this into the YTA category but very slightly. I think there needs to be a better system of relaying information in the household. Perhaps he puts reminder notifications on his phone.", "yta calm down.", "YTA. This is a very small issue, calling him selfish was so uncalled for. An hour more of a nap is hardly the end of things.
