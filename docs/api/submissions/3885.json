He does a lot around our son and I usually feel like we\u2019re doing an equal amount of work at home. But he does not do mental labour. I am the planner, and it\u2019s a bit of a thorn in my side sometimes. \n\nOn Saturday afternoons we normally have a play date. Our friends who we see were at another family members house and invited us to join them. The plan was to be there roughly around 2. Our toddler usually naps from 12-2 ish like clockwork. We will wake him up if he sleeps late so that he can get to sleep at night. The place we were supposed to go is maybe 30 mins away so they knew we\u2019d be a little late. I relayed all this info to my husband. \n\nI was not actually supposed to go with them because I had an appointment at the same time. I was excited to have an afternoon to myself. However, I get back from my appointment at 3 and my husband is still home and toddler is still sleeping. He had gone down at 12 so had been sleeping 3 hours. I asked my husband what was going on and why they hadn\u2019t left yet. He looked all confused saying that the baby was asleep. I asked him why he didn\u2019t wake him so they could go. I guess he either didn\u2019t realize it was 3 or forgot when he went down for his nap.  \n\nI got mad and told him that he was selfish. We couldn\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house 2 hours after they invited us to be there with a groggy toddler who had slept too long. And now I was loosing my afternoon off and probably going to have to deal with a toddler who won\u2019t sleep later. \n\nI feel a little bad because he does take good care of our son.

This becomes more and more important when the kids start school too so now is the right time to act.", "I don\u2019t think he was selfish. but my mom taught me, never wake a sleeping baby. I didn\u2019t. I worried about my middle son because he slept more than my first as an infant. I took him to the pediatrician twice, the doctor told me, calm down. He\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t sweat this. Get some rest yourself.", "NTA\n\nI have no idea how your husband has made it this far into being a parent and not recognized that sleep schedules are very important to having happy lives.    You need to make sure your husband is the one who's doing the physical labor of getting your toddler to sleep tonight.", "Just some more info on the play date since it seems to be a sticking point lol. They are with a friend of my husband and his children. Both our families agreed to schedule an ongoing playdate Saturday afternoon, but it\u2019s flexible if people can\u2019t make it. It\u2019s a godsend because entertaining a toddler in your own home by yourself is chaos. \n\nThis week they messaged us and said they were going to a family members house and invited us to go with them. I spoke with my husband and told him I can\u2019t go, but asked if he wanted to take our son. He said yes.", "NTA. That is super frustrating. My partner has time blindness probably related to ADHD. Could your husband be neurodivergent? It is worth looking into with your family doctor. My partner wears a smartwatch now and it helps. I would also have your husband handle bedtime tonight since he let kiddo sleep too long.", "NTA\n\nI'm assuming he's mentally sound and capable of holding a job? In which case there's no excuse for why he magically gets brain damage the moment it's about managing his child / the household. Stop letting him get away with it.", "You are blowing this way out of proportion. I get being annoyed about things but I dont think this is a reason to explode at your husband. Take some time to think inward and see what is REALLY bothering you.", "My toddler often sleeps for three hours in the afternoon, they need rest, how early are you putting him down at night?\n\nIt sounds like you are more pissed about losing your alone time than you are about anything else, which I\u2019d argue is more selfish than simply letting a toddler get rest\n\nYTA, just a bit", "You need to quit it with this constant \u201ceverything has to be done on a perfect schedule\u201d thing. Just because you normally have play dates scheduled for Saturdays doesn\u2019t mean that you have to do it every weekend as if it\u2019s your religion. That is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nAlso, another thing that bothers me is that you talk about how you were excited to have an afternoon to yourself, which is fine, but then you have the nerve to complain about how he spent his afternoon with the baby. Your husband was responsible and took care of the baby while you were away even if the baby slept a little over their scheduled nap time. Your husband probably just felt that if they were sleeping peacefully, he wouldn\u2019t want to disturb him, and that\u2019s okay. You weren\u2019t even home. \n\nIf you get to enjoy your time out and about, you don\u2019t need to nag to get him to do exactly what you would do and expect him to stick to your perfect schedule. He\u2019s a human being, not a robot. You are the one who is being selfish here.\n\nYTA.", "INFO: Did your husband actually want to go to this thing? Or is it just what you always arrange and he always goes along with and he just decided to enjoy the couch and actually being at home for once while you were out?", "NAH But it would do you and everyone around you a lot of good if you would develop some flexibility. Having a toddler is hard enough without being so stressed out about the occasional chaos. \n\nIf the baby is sleeping longer than usual, for heaven's sake don't wake them up! Your toddler may be going through a growth spurt and might have needed that extra hour of sleep.\n\nIf the other person he disappointed is a parent, hopefully they have already developed this type of flexibility. It's parenting. Things get messy.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NAH\n\nHe has different expectations of planning that then you have.  Your planned and routined system is not necessarily better then letting your baby nap until their done napping.  I suspect if you pushed he would see your child as over scheduled", "ESH. I think you need to sit down with your husband and communicate the real issue, which is that you feel like he needs to be supervised\u2026and you shouldn\u2019t have to do all the mental logistics just because you\u2019re the mom.", "NAH.\n\nI'd be annoyed at my husband over this too, but less for the nap and more for flaking on plans (to be fair i wouldn't even make plans unless i was attending myself).", "YTA. I\u2019m confused as to why your views on your son sleeping need to take precedence over your husband\u2019s. He\u2019s a parent too (as you note) so why can\u2019t he be entrusted to make decisions? If he thought the kid needed a longer sleep, why such a tantrum from you afterwards? You seem to be very much \u201cWhat I say goes when it comes to the child I share with you\u201d.\n\nEdit: change from NAH to YTA.", "YTA. Way to make a mountain out of a molehill. Btw, there is no need to wake up a sleeping toddler. If you provide plenty of activities in the second half of the day, they'll tire themselves out in time for bedtime.", "YTA, holy cow. Get a grip.", "Esh. You for making a character attack on your husband. Your husband for not doing enough.\n\nAlthough he probably would do more if you let him do things his way sometimes. Let him deal with toddler tonight and he will understand the reasoning for things on his own", "YTA it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s selfish. He may be absent minded but it doesn\u2019t mean he was only thinking about himself and ignoring your needs, it means he forgot.", "Yta \nHe made one mistake.", "YTA a bit, and tell the husband to deal with the well rested toddler who doesn't want to deal with bed time.", "Slight YTA.  He didn\u2019t think about all the consequences. I thin you can explain that without accusing him.  Why must you lose the whole afternoon.  Can\u2019t you just walk husband through his tasks and with him luck?", "Light yta. This doesn't sound like selfishness, this seems like it could be a lot of things including simply being tired. Missing 1 playdate hardly seems worth insulting someone over.\n\nThis sounds like you being disappointed about your alone time not working out", "YTA Sometimes things don't go according to plan. You continually say he's a good dad but you're berating him and calling him selfish because he accidentally let the kid sleep an extra hour?", "YTA.  You make plans for your husband not considering that maybe he'd want to make his own plans?  Like it's every guy's greatest desire to spend his Saturday afternoon shuttling the toddler to a play date.  EVERY Saturday afternoon.  So the dynamic here is, you make plans for your son, then bark out orders to your husband to facilitate the plans you made for you son.  And you call your husband selfish?!?!?!?!?\n\nIf he had the slightest bit of self-respect at all, you never would have gotten past the first date.  He is sooooooooooo the opposite of selfish.", "YTA.  Your husband didn't do exactly as you wanted him to and then you threw a tantrum at him.  Cool your jets and have a discussion about the mental load at home and how to equally divide it.", "Before kids....okay wth  why is my cousin always 30 min late or backing out of plans due to kids. After being a parent I look back am amazed she kept it all together. I pretty much expect any playdate  , kid outing can he canceled \n\nHave you discussd the challenges? Perhoas he doesng actually want to excecute your orders and feels natural wakeup ok. Perhaps you don't delegate and setup outings while you are out. Still take that \"me\" time but don't stack the deck that he needs to run a precise military operation . Just lower the bar to kid is still in good condition when you return", "I am not a mother myself but I understand that getting a toddler to sleep can be rough. I don\u2019t think your husband was intentionally being selfish because things happen and people forget, but I do understand the frustration considering you and your family were invited over another family\u2019s house. I think making your husband feel bad over a slip up pushes this into the YTA category but very slightly. I think there needs to be a better system of relaying information in the household. Perhaps he puts reminder notifications on his phone.", "yta calm down.", "YTA. This is a very small issue, calling him selfish was so uncalled for. An hour more of a nap is hardly the end of things. And a toddler should totally be able to wake up in a 30 minute drive. This seems like a total overreaction.", "ESH, he wasn\u2019t malicious, just careless with time, which I sympathize with being the same way. Try to be collaborative, not combative, and suggest figuring out a system that works, like setting a reminder in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t understand why you think your husband was being selfish. These posts are difficult because there are so many nuances in every situation. You said he\u2019s a good father. \u201cSelfish\u201d is a loaded word. Maybe you need a nap or a date night or to tell him what\u2019s really bothering you.", "NTA! Kids sleep schedules are key and so is having time to yourself. But it sounds like your husband just didn\u2019t think things through, and wasn\u2019t acting maliciously. So calling him selfish might not have been accurate.

You knew the plan for the day. Did you tell your husband the plan for the day or did you assume he was supposed to remember it? If you didn\u2019t remind him before you left, what do you expect? You made the plans, right?", "This was my take on it, too. It isn't even really that the little one napped late, it's that they had plans that they agreed on, and when OP came home it was all \"Oh, wait, what? I had to function without hand holding? Um... Well, that's really hard, so... I didn't do that?\"\n\nA lot of people in this thread act like it's perfectly fine for kids to have their schedules all thrown off, too. For some, it totally is! For others, it is a nightmare, and her husband just created the nightmare and it sounds like OP has to fix it.", "I wouldn't go so far as to assume he's doing this purposefully based on how little information we're given (though it could be the case)--however, he is still very much at fault. I am super forgetful and have a terrible sense of time. But part of being a functioning adult is learning to cope with this. As soon as I make a plan, I set an alarm on my phone. Sometimes multiple, depending on the activity. If I know I have to do something in an hour, I don't trust myself to keep track of the hour by myself, and set an alarm.", "Yup. This was how I saw it. Weaponized incompetence. NTA, OP.", "Idk why people are so torqued about this. It sounds likes there were plans made in advance with your husband\u2019s friends and he just flaked on them. \n\nI think anyone that doesn\u2019t understand the importance of an afternoon off hasn\u2019t spent much time caring for a child. NTA", "But he made an agreement with friends to be somewhere. This could even possibly effect future play dates if the people care about friends just not showing up. If he hadn\u2019t agreed to the plans well before it wouldn\u2019t be such a big issue but he literally agreed to be somewhere with his son. He flaked on mutual friends.", "Because if a toddler naps too long it screws up EVERYTHING.", "But he didn\u2019t seem to think the kid needed more sleep. He just lost track of time.

She says that she has to do all the mental load.", "which she has e ery right to be upset about.\n\nThis is not 1 afternoon, this is a pattern of the dad not being a dad and being responsible. The final straw.", "what? play dates are for kids to spend time with other kids. \n\nthey are normal and important for kids' socialisation. \n\nif dad has a real problem with taking his kid to a playdate he's not a great dad.\n\nAnd it doesn't say that he is always the one taking the kid.", "It doesn\u2019t say anywhere that the play dates are his responsibility to do and not op. Op literally said she would\u2019ve done it but she had an appointment. \u201cIt\u2019s every guys greatest desire to spend his Saturday afternoon shuttling the toddler to a play date.\u201d Boohoo. Op also deserves to spend her Saturdays relaxing, not just the husband. Op would\u2019ve gotten the chance to relax but the husband messed up the toddlers sleeping schedule. A toddlers nap time isn\u2019t simple business, it needs to be maintained or else the whole day is ruined. And since the husband watched the kids for the time op was at her appointment, op will have to deal with the toddlers behavior after their sleep schedule was disturbed. Op is not in the wrong for being upset and her husbands carelessness. Maybe she should\u2019ve been more gentle but this is a constant issue as it is normal to be annoyed when plans are ruined.", "If he did not take the kid to playdate that is one thing. But 3 hour naps can and do leave the kid super grumpy all day and then mess up bedtime, possibly messing up their sleeping for several days after as well. Depends on the kid. Only time I let my daughter sleep extra is if she is sick (and was up all night before)", "Someone here literally said 'what's wrong with walking your husband through his tasks' and my brain nearly exploded like, what?\n\nI'm also really confused by the overwhelming y t a comments. I thought it was pretty standard to try to keep a toddler on their sleep schedule or else they get real difficult. Myabe that's just my nieces and nephews, cos they def do.\n\nAnd yeah then just no showing to a playdate? \n\nLike maybe going off about it was too harsh, but husband did not acquit himself well here.", "Amen!

Husband was.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s clear from the post \u2026 OP made some guesses as to what the reason was, but she clearly said \u201cI guess\u201c. Then she threw her tantrum.", "I understand that.  That's why most kids attend pre-school.  You can't be a good father if you lose yourself in the process.  You've got to pursue your own interests.  You can't and shouldn't allow your life to revolve only around the kiddo.  Having toddler do a playdate every Saturday afternoon is extreme.  Of course, wifey barking out orders and discipline like a drill sergeant is pretty extreme, also.  \n\nIt's sad that we are living in times where men are sheep.", "yep...the amount of people saying she should have held his hand through the whole process blows my mind.", ">Someone here literally said 'what's wrong with walking your husband through his tasks' and my brain nearly exploded like, what?\n\nI mean, if she's already caring for one toddler why not two /s\n\nIn all seriousness, it's clearly not healthy to have someone have to keep track of both their own life and a clearly capable adult's. If the husband can't actually keep track of what he has to do then he should develop a system to help him that isn't \"just have my wife do it\".\n\nIn this day and age it's really not hard to keep a personal calendar or notes of reminders.", "Agreed. I'm so confused about how OP is the asshole. At best, it's ESH.", "Again, nothing in this says that dad is constantly doing the playdates or losing his chance to have his own life. It's one playdate that we know of that he was on duty for. That is all.\n\nI thnk you're projecting a lot here.", "Did you read the OP?  It's every Saturday, which definitely precludes hubby from having any life of his own.  I'm not projecting anything, I just know how to read, and I'm assuming the facts are as OP presented them.", "where does it say that *dad* has to go to the playdate every saturday\n\nin addition, however often he specifically goes, it's a few hours on a Saturday when he hangs out with his kid, and his friend, and his friends kid, while they play. \n\nmy brother, for e.g., takes his kid to swimming lessons + playdate every saturday morning. He enjoys it because, yknow, he likes spending time with his kid. he also has a very full and fullfilling life of his own outside of his child and his wife. \n\nhanging out with your kid for a few hours on one day of the weekend does not amount to precluding any life of his own, and it's sad you think it does."]}
