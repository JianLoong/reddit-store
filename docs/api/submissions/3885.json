He does a lot around our son and I usually feel like we\u2019re doing an equal amount of work at home. But he does not do mental labour. I am the planner, and it\u2019s a bit of a thorn in my side sometimes. \n\nOn Saturday afternoons we normally have a play date. Our friends who we see were at another family members house and invited us to join them. The plan was to be there roughly around 2. Our toddler usually naps from 12-2 ish like clockwork. We will wake him up if he sleeps late so that he can get to sleep at night. The place we were supposed to go is maybe 30 mins away so they knew we\u2019d be a little late. I relayed all this info to my husband. \n\nI was not actually supposed to go with them because I had an appointment at the same time. I was excited to have an afternoon to myself. However, I get back from my appointment at 3 and my husband is still home and toddler is still sleeping. He had gone down at 12 so had been sleeping 3 hours. I asked my husband what was going on and why they hadn\u2019t left yet. He looked all confused saying that the baby was asleep. I asked him why he didn\u2019t wake him so they could go. I guess he either didn\u2019t realize it was 3 or forgot when he went down for his nap.  \n\nI got mad and told him that he was selfish. We couldn\u2019t go to someone\u2019s house 2 hours after they invited us to be there with a groggy toddler who had slept too long. And now I was loosing my afternoon off and probably going to have to deal with a toddler who won\u2019t sleep later. \n\nI feel a little bad because he does take good care of our son.

I think making your husband feel bad over a slip up pushes this into the YTA category but very slightly. I think there needs to be a better system of relaying information in the household. Perhaps he puts reminder notifications on his phone.", "yta calm down.", "YTA. This is a very small issue, calling him selfish was so uncalled for. An hour more of a nap is hardly the end of things.

And you'll take it out on your husband, and your kid will see you as the one who is stressed and yelling all the time.\n\nUnwind yourself!", "You're a little bit of an AH....you don't really mean he's selfish and in order to fix the problem you have to explain it.  Calling him selfish kind of frames it the wrong way and makes it less likely he will hear you and fix it.  NTA because I get why you're sick of it and why you said it but in the context of fixing your problem you're kind of an AH.", "NTA. I\u2019m the primary parent as well and this would make me so angry. Sleep schedules are important.", "Unless this happens all the time, cut him slack", "Was this a one time thing? If he\u2019s usually good about adhering to the schedule then I would think you\u2019re being a bit much. Things happen- and adults get tired. But if this is a common occurrence then I get the frustration.", "[removed]", "Yeah sorry YTA. A missed play date is not something to get worked up over. I do understand the frustration with not having the quiet afternoon you expected but unfortunately that\u2019s the life of a parent. Especially parents of a small child.\n\nAnd I know every child is different but I\u2019m gonna let you in on a great piece of advice I received from a sleep coach when my son was a baby: sleep begets sleep. It\u2019s a fallacy that a child\u2019s long naps will keep them up at night. It doesn\u2019t answer your concern about the baby being groggy- that\u2019s human nature. But you shouldn\u2019t feel like you need to wake baby up to maintain a schedule of sleep (alone). Scheduled activities are another story though so no comment there another than above.", "YTA.  Cut the guy some slack and stop being so dramatic over small things.", "OP should have told her husband to take kiddo out for the afternoon and run the extra energy from the long nap off. And he gets to deal with bedtime tonight. \n\nIf he\u2019s used to her taking the mental load and him getting extra time off by \u201cforgetting\u201d, something needs to be done to help him remember in future. A toddler with far too much energy seems like just the thing.", "Op said he\u2019s a good father. I\u2019d say it was just a lapse in judgment or something else relatively innocent. NTA but don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big a deal as you say", "It\u2019s like rule #1 of toddler parenting, don\u2019t mess with the sleep schedule. One day that messes with the sleep schedule can affect sleep for days.", "Timers are so helpful for things like this, i have ADHD and i have to set a timer for literally any important time-sensitive thing. Hell even if OPs husband isnt neurodivergent, he should still consider using timers if he often loses track of time like this.", "Yes I feel like this puts it into perspective.", "You don\u2019t have to be malicious to be selfish. Just thinking of yourself all the time without intentionally wanting to hurt others is the definition of selfish to me. Acting with the intent to harm others would be petty or cruel, depending on the amount of harm.", "Oh yes. Totally limited to men. /s", "Triggered much? I put my daughter to bed every night from birth to 2 yrs old. I\u2019m a dude", "It\u2019s not that serious \ud83d\ude44", "The schedule is for the benefit of the child. She clearly knows her kid, and she says if he\u2019s not woken up he won\u2019t go to sleep in the evening. Letting the baby sleep so he could do his own thing was selfish or just dumb. Both are bad. \n\nAlso, the playdate was made by him with his friends. It\u2019s rude as hell to flake last minute, presumably without even telling them. \n\nWe also don\u2019t know what her appointment was for. It doesn\u2019t seem like it was free time, which she does deserve. And sounds like she doesn\u2019t get because she has to manage her family with no help from her partner. He should be capable of remembering and enforcing schedules for his young child without any monitoring from her. He\u2019s behaving as more of a babysitter/helper than a real, equal partner.\n\nEdit: NTA, OP.", "I\u2019ve raised 3 kids and completely agree with you. She sounds absolutely exhausting.", "Agreed lol", "Her toddler may just be getting closer to the time in their life where they drop the nap entirely. I definitely went through a phase with mine where if he slept for a little bit too long he would be a cranky monster afterward, then eventually he wouldn\u2019t fall asleep every day until it made more sense to just keep him awake. You don\u2019t go from steady naps to no naps instantly, there\u2018s usually a lot of adjusting and easing into it. I\u2019d also be pissed if my husband had soent the afternoon \u00ab\u00a0watching\u00a0\u00bb the kiddo which turned out to be staying silent as long as possible to stretch out the nap, only to tap out at night because it\u2019s my turn to be on baby duty and he\u2019s left me with a kid whose sleep is all messed up. It\u2019s not much of a favor if he\u2019s just making her life harder later on, it\u2019s a punishment for taking me-time.", "The mental load. It's right there in the post.", "Lots of younger toddlers really need to adhere to a regular nap schedule to function well.\n\nIf my two year old naps past 3:30pm, she stays up late in her crib at bedtime. Then she wakes up at 5-5:30am. Then she\u2019s miserable because she didn\u2019t get enough sleep and we all suffer. \n\nThere are some things you can\u2019t be flexible with when it comes to toddlers.\n\nETA: I wake my toddler up from her nap at 3:3:0 if she is still asleep.", "Infant sleep is completely different than toddler sleep. Toddlers should sleep 12-14 hours total, including naps. So overdoing a nap will throw off nighttime sleep and can legit disturb the schedule for days. Clearly mom knows this about her kid.\n\nNTA at all - I would be SO PISSED at the dad for this. When your kid\u2019s schedule works, you don\u2019t mess it up just so you can sit around and shirk your parenting duties .", "Why the hell should a grown ass man need his hand held???", "I feel like OP was actually more annoyed at losing her afternoon to herself, which I get, but this is a bit of an overreaction. OP might find life easier if she stops sweating this petty shit.", "People are allowed to be upset by things that impact more than their basic needs, and be upset by behavior that's, you know, not abuse level bad.\n\nBecause people who love you are great. People who love you who don't take advantage of you by coasting on their responsibilities to dump them on you? Better.", "Holy assumptions Batman! You just filled in the rest of her life based on the fact the kid naps from 12-2.", "Lol. Why are you so mad? Maybe this is their first kid and she thinks she\u2019s over-reacting cause some ppl don\u2019t think a sleep schedule is overtly important. You don\u2019t know man", "Maybe with a baby, but not with all toddlers.  When my youngest was a toddler, an hour extra during a nap time would mean two extra hours getting her to sleep that night.  Which would cause her to be extra cranky the next day, because she had one less total hours of sleep.", ">He looked all confused saying that the baby was asleep.\n\nUnfortunately that sounds like he expected _the baby_ to wake up on time and remind dad that it\u2019s time to go. No, man, that\u2019s _a baby,_ they don\u2019t have internal clocks or use alarm clocks yet.", "Thanks. My partner, my child, and I are all neurodivergent.

You think these descriptions are overboard and exaggerate the situation? WELL, DID YOU CONSIDER ME AND MY FEELINGS WHEN YOU DID THE THING THAT LED TO THIS CONFLICT?!

You\u2019re a real catch, aren\u2019t you?", "She says it\u2019s every Saturday, and yet, she didn\u2019t add the additional note until later on. I don\u2019t see the problem with someone backing out on something. Sometimes things don\u2019t go as planned. He\u2019s the only one who was going to go, so if he didn\u2019t want to or didn\u2019t feel like it or even just forgot, he\u2019s allowed not to go. She mentions it\u2019s even flexible if someone can\u2019t make it.\n\nWhy is she allowed to do what she wants to do but is freaking out because he didn\u2019t stick to the original plan? Nothing is wrong with that. He can make his own decisions. He doesn\u2019t need her to dictate what he chooses to do.", "She thinks that.\nSome people are hell bent on planning out every single detail of their lives. And that's the vibe OP is giving off.\nNot everyone is like that, which is perfectly fine. I would argue, even better.\nIf that were the case, I'd see why OP thinks she's carrying water for the husband, when the husband didn't even need it in the first place.\nHonestly, OP sounds insufferable.", "I\u2019m curious as to how much of the physical load her husband does.", "Sorry I don\u2019t think he was selfish. A toddler is a baby. I would have let the baby sleep too.", "Oh you\u2019re right they should divorce", "He shouldn't, but she picked him. If she wants her life planned down to the minute, she's gotta micromanage.", "Does no one have any type of rational thinking anymore? My husband let me baby sleep an hour longer.... Quick, to the internet to see if he's an asshole.... Like seriously, what the fuck are we doing anymore.... It's ridiculous.", "Yeah definite caveat to what I said that every kid is different. Some are just good/not good sleepers. I am thankful I\u2019m no longer in that stage haha\n\nIt takes a while especially if you\u2019re a first time parent to get used to your child\u2019s sleep patterns.", "Husband agreed to the plans with HIS friend", "Look if the context was different this would be correct and hold weight. However, in this context, part of husband having the toddler was to give mom an afternoon off, op seemed quite clear about that. \n\nOp is NTA as dad should absolutely know how rude it is to just bail on the schedule, flake on a play date and leave his wife to deal with the impact on toddles sleep schedule.", "Because she has an appointment. And during the one time she relied on her husband to get the kid to a play date, he dropped the ball.", "My two year old is utterly miserable if we let her nap past 3:30pm.

Then she\u2019s miserable all day. \n\nBreaking the routine sucks and isn\u2019t worth it.", "Things may have evolved since you had your kids. I agree that kids do need sleep schedules and so does the general medical community now-a-days.", "Get your words out of my mouth.", "She wanted her husband to get their kid up from his usual nap and take him to a play date. \n\nWhere is the need for micromanaging there?", "I understand why OP think this would be a question since it may not be a big deal to society but is to her.", "IDK about OP and her husband, I do know that there have been times I've tried reminding and coaxing and then get told I'm nagging. There's just no winning sometimes.", "She shouldn't have to hold his hand but she also shouldn't freak out when things don't go exactly to her plan. \n\nWhen you have toddlers you have to be flexible. Sometimes the day doesn't go well so you skip a playdate, or eat a little later/earlier etc. Routine is important but this level of rigidity is ridiculous.\n\nThere was no reason for OP to cancel her afternoon off. Husband was home to take care of kid so she us still free to do whatever. He can take kud to park to burn off steam at 3 and if kid is bouncing off the walls at night he can deal with it.\n\nThere is no need for op to blowup like this. Maybe she takes on the \"mental load\" because she is a perfectionist and micromanager.", "Evolved lol.", "She was mad about the time. He didn't say he was blowing off the playdate.", "You realize this was very likely not the first time this has happened right? He\u2019s definitely being irresponsible", "I thought the afternoon off was because she would get home from the appointment while he was with the child on the play date.

Sometimes the day doesn't go well so you skip a playdate, or eat a little later/earlier etc. Routine is important but this level of rigidity is ridiculous.\n\nBut him missing the play date and letting him sleep too long wasnt done intentionally to improvise and best meet the childs needs. He wasnt being attentive.  So theres no reason to believe now that moms home hes goign to be attentively caring for the kid.
