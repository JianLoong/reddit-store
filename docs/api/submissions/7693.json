Mom had more money than dad. I was always sort of aware of that. When my dad married his wife Angie, I was maybe 4 and I don't remember those super early days, but I do remember she was always calling my mom \"the baby mama\" and more specifically \"the bitter baby mama\". She never tried to hide that stuff from me. Not sure dad knew for sure but I always assumed he at least knew how she felt about mom. Her annoyance at my mom only got worse when she and my dad had six kids in eight years and struggled to afford them. My mom refused to help them out or give them anything or play an aunt like person to their kids and Angie hated mom for that. She'd always say it was just bitterness that she was the baby mama and not the wifeypoo (what she calls herself). So yeah, I always disliked Angie. Dad was always more polite to mom while I was around and she never said anything about either of them so if he was a dick, I didn't know about it.\n\nI'm now 26 and I got engaged 3 months ago. Angie was all excited and told all her friends and family that she couldn't wait to plan the wedding with me and how they'd of course all be welcome dress shopping with us. I said nothing to her about wedding stuff and then she found out I took my mom and both grandma's window shopping for wedding dresses (I want an idea of what I want for my wedding before booking a consultation). She called and said how as my stepmom she should have been included in all that and she thought I'd want my real family there and how could I invite \\*her\\* instead. I told her she was crazy and pathetic if she thought I would pick her, the woman who always spoke degradingly about my mom and who felt entitled to what my mom worked hard for, over my actual mom who never spoke a bad word about her or dad. She shrieked and asked what I said. So I told her she was crazy and that her behavior was pathetic and she was nothing more than my dad's plus one.\n\nShe told me she had treated me well enough to expect more respect and how fucking dare I talk to her that way. She told everyone she knew it feels like (even posting it to Facebook). Dad called after the encounter and asked me what happened and I told him everything. He asked if I would be willing to accept an apology from her and maybe apologize for calling her crazy (he didn't say anything about pathetic). I told him it would depend because I don't think she's a good enough person to give a genuine apology. She sent me a text afterward, I assume after my dad tried to get her to apologize, saying I owed her all the apologies and needed to work on making it up to her. My aunt (dad's sister) said nobody really likes Angie except for dad but to keep the peace I should maybe apologize even if I don't mean it...

If you want to try and keep the peace, apologize for calling her crazy and in the same breath say that I stand by everything else I said. \"You did degrade my mother and felt entitled to her money while she never cared or said anything bad about you.\" Those are facts and don't need an apology. Also perhaps I'm sorry that you feel entitled to be involved in my wedding planning, but that's not going to happen. I hate step-parents like her.", "I\u2019m just going to go with NTA here.  Angie doesn\u2019t deserve a relationship with you, and it seems you have little interest in one with her.  Nothing wrong there!  \n\nI\u2019m also not sure what Angie thought was going to happen by trashtalking your own mother to your face from the day you were old enough to understand.

My future daughter-in-law took her Mom and family wedding dress shopping and I wasn\u2019t included. I really wanted to go but not one part of me thought she was disrespecting me. It is hard to plan a wedding and make everyone happy. I support my son and his future wife.

You know how you feel, you experienced what you experienced, so I believe you should keep standing your ground on this. Have you told those pressuring you to apologize, her awful words and behavior towards you mom?

You don't owe her an apology.  At this point, I wouldn't give dad a plus one invite.  I am pretty sure that's why he pushed Angie to apologize because he knows what OP's next move would/should be (and that's to uninvite Angie).\n\nI don't know why you'd want your mom and Angie to even be in the same room considering all the trash talking she did about your mom growing up.", "Great another dad who who stands up for his kids like a slinky. \n\nListen to your aunt, there isn\u2019t any peace needed to be kept.
