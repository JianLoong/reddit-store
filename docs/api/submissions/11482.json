I can tell you after a full day of meetings and more work and cooking and helping the kids\u2026if my husband didn\u2019t help with the clean up - my house would be engulfed in laundry and wrappers..", "NTA. But I would be looking for any excuse at all to avoid your in-laws.", "NTA\n\nIf they want traditional values then they should either put up or shut up. Their backwoods 1940s thinking says that a woman is supposed to do all the housework, but, they're neglecting to mention that the woman is also supposed to be a stahm with a husband who works one job that pays enough to own a house and give the family a good standard of living.\n\nI'm not you and of course you know better then me, but what if you act fake grateful next time they bring it up? Because if they're suggesting for you live a life that's up to their standards, then they obviously must be offering to supplement the missing income if you quit your job to satisfy their wants.\n\nThey're talking about assigned gender roles. If they seriously want you to act like their imagined version of a wife, then they must want you to take it seriously. You'd only be doing what they wanted by taking it seriously. You can't do the job they want you to do because your family needs a second income. So, they must be offering $$$ to help make that possible.", "NTA and think about this: you are teaching your kids that they ARE EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE for the chores. You're doing great and your husband shouldn't have to hide that he contributes to the household. He should be proud of it.", "I'm a bloke and I absolutely agree with you. \n\nKids or not, if you're both working, the house and its organisation couldn't give a shit about who does what. Dishes need to be cleared, clothes need to be washed, paintwork needs to be painted, clothes need to be ironed and put away and to expect daily tasks to be done based on gender is utterly ridiculous.\n\nSaying all of that though, OP, are you sure you wouldn't rather clear the table and spend an hour or two doing the dishes than having to be in the company, on your own, of these two dinosaurs?\n\nNTA but next time, get a takeaway and have the containers on the table and a pedal bin next to it so no-one has to go anywhere. See if they like that.", "ESH\n\nI think you need to be more flexible.\n\nYou don't tell us how often your husband sees his parents. If it is not often then I think ideally you should all chat around the table. And put chores down the list of priorities.\n\nIf there was a reason for the dishes being done straightaway then you could all help with them.\n\nYour parents in law are awful AHs. That goes without saying. And well done for standing up to them.\n\n'making' sounds super controlling. If this is your attitude I wonder about the health and balance of your relationship. Why would you think like this?  How does your husband feel about you thinking it's appropriate for you to make him do stuff?  IMO you are the AH for this.", "My husband wanders around exclaiming \"a woman's work is never done\" in a high pitched voice while pretending to have boobs."]}
