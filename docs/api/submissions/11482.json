My in-laws are not bad people but they believe in very traditional gender roles when it comes to marriage.  My husband also felt this way when we started dating 6 years ago. It was a major deal breaker for me so before we moved in together I made it clear I would not both work full-time and then come home and be responsible for all the chores at home.  My husband agreed to these terms but struggled in the beginning to the point where I moved out and we broke up for about 3 months.  \n\nIt was a bit of an adjustment but after some time we found a natural flow to manage our household.  His parents are aware of why we had broken up and they are a bit horrified that I \u201cmake\u201d my husband do the dishes and scrub a toilet among other \u201cwoman\u2019s work.\u201d I mostly ignore their glances and faces but the other night my MIL actually verbalized their feelings for the first time.\n\nAfter a dinner that I cooked (my husband can cook now but couldn\u2019t when we met) we were sitting around the table enjoying a glass of wine when my husband got up to clear the table (I did not ask but it is his responsibility if I cook) and I guess he decided to also do the dishes which he would also be responsible for.  \n\nIt was about 15 minutes after he left the table when my FIL asked where he was; I said he was probably doing the dishes so he doesn\u2019t have to do them later and my MIL piped to question why I hadn\u2019t cleared the table and why I wasn\u2019t doing the dishes. I simply said it was his job to do it and my MIL said something about how much he hates doing it and that in her day, she would never make FIL do that.  I just joked, \u201cwell I guess I just trained Andrew better\u201d (he often says I trained him well as a joke). \n\nMIL and FIL didn\u2019t laugh and I changed the subject.  The next day my husband was talking to his mom and she mentioned how she was upset that he walked away from the table and that I could have done the dishes so they could spend more time with him.  He mentioned that he could have done the dishes after they left but figured 15-20 minutes weren\u2019t a big deal.  She doubled down and said that I could have just done it so they could have spent the time visiting.  She said my \u201crules\u201d are rigid and he has allowed me to \u201cwear the pants\u201d when he is the man of the house. He defended our setup by saying we both contribute equally to the household. \n\nSo now I have been thinking, am I the AH for not picking up the slack when they are over? For reference, my parents also come over often and my husband and I still fulfill our chores but I normally do the cooking for guests because even though my husband has learned to cook, he is a basic cook.  My mom thinks I should just order food or let him cook when they come over so then I would do the cleanup.

They have grossly antiquated views and they likely won\u2019t ever see it your way. I speak from experience having dealt with plenty of family members with rigid views of what each sex should be responsible for doing in the home.\n\nEdited for clarity", "NTA\n\n\n\nMy husband and I have the same attitude towards household chores: we both are responsible for the cleanliness of our home. There's no trading off, no one chore only he does or I do, no schedule. We just do whatever needs to be done when it needs it. \n\n\n\nThat being said, we generally follow the rule of \"Whoever didn't cook, cleans\". One year we hosted Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and a cookie baking extravaganza with our nieces - with NO dishwasher. I did the bulk of the cooking, and my husband was cleaning dishes as they left my hand. He washed them in the order they'd be needed. For the really big meals, he would take over cooking at the end so I was sitting down first. I had one Friendsgiving where the three people cleaning up the kitchen were all men: my husband, my FIL, and our good buddy. I didn't ask, they just did it.\n\n\n\nTaking care of one's home is not a \"wifely\" duty. It's the responsibility of the people who own their home. Do not bow down or change how your house runs to meet the antiquated ideas of your in-laws.

You don't get slack when your parents are over. It is only fair in this situation. If he wants slack, then he needs to be willing to give it in return. Sounds like his parents are very old fashioned (I mean sexist lol). That sucks. Sounds like he still wants to have them in his life but also wants to please you. He did defend you so that sounds good for you both.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA - you are a partnership , 50/50 and you're not the low status doormat who is only good for cleaning toilets and washing dishes.  If MIL is happy with that, that's her choice.\n\nYou don't go to their house and tell them to re arrange their marriage for your conveinence and comfort -, how dare they have the never to even say it to you.  \n\nCleary your husband has never bought into the whole 'my wife is an equal' becuase he didn't tell his parents to cop onto themselves and join the 20 or 21st Century!  They probably have been working on him for years, telling him that he needs a less 'uppity' wife, somebody good at following him about, one of those 'surrendered' females\n\nNext time they visits - its hotels and restaurnts only for them,  Dont let then over the threshold of a house they don't respect.  They would no doubt be happy with a man paid to serve, cook and clean doing the job, and probably tip men better than women", "NTA and it sounds like you and your husband are on the same page. How often do his parents come over for dinner?  Honestly if less that weekly I'd have let him clear the table and then gone out and done the dishes for him so he could have a better visit with his parents.
