I say NTA, ultimately it's your husband's decision since these are in his name.", "NTA It is unlikely the family would need to know. Even if they did, it is not your debt and shouldn't be your burden to carry. It isn't as if you are trying to throw your FIL in jail.

Could your FIL\u2019s accounts be showing on your husband\u2019s account by mistake?  My father and I have the same name (I\u2019m Jr). A few years back I had a credit check for a car loan and a bunch of his accounts showed up on my credit. In talking with the credit companies (Experian, etc) it was easy to clear up the issue.

The police report is about fraud, not the person. You\u2019re not a prosecutor. You are reporting a crime you\u2019re a victim of. I agree with previous posters that unless you tell his family, the family will not need to know.\nFurther, it is likely he did this to other people. Your report might help other people with their insurance claims regarding fraud, and the family might not know he committed fraud against your husband if there are multiple fraud reports.", "Something is off with this story. \n\nI find it hard to believe that FOUR collections reports were on your husband's account for 5 years and neither of you knew. Collections agencies are *hounds*. They will call, write, email, whatever they possibly can to get in touch with you and get their money. Not to mention you've been saving for 7 months for a down payment to buy a house, so this has been a plan for awhile. At no point during those 7 months did you or your husband check his credit? That's all a really hard sell for me. I'll admit it's not impossible, but it seems very unlikely neither of you knew about this.\n\nI think at the very least, your husband knew about these accounts and likely agreed for his father to put them in his name. That would be a good explanation for not wanting to \"tarnish his father's name\", because if your husband agreed it wasn't fraud by definition.

They moved multiple times and even changed their names, but whoever was doing it kept finding their information and using it to open credit cards and other accounts while running up massive debt in their names. It literally ruined their lives. Eventually, the woman\u2019s mom passed, and as they were cleaning out her stuff, the woman discovered hidden stashes of fancy items and receipts. It had been her mother the entire time\u2014 the person they trusted and thought was a victim too had betrayed them both and ensured they would never be able to have healthy financial lives or prosper. \n\nThe only thing to do in this situation is to file a police report.

Could it have \n-\tDoes your husband have siblings, is it possible *they* are also in a similar position and trying to protect his dad? \n-\tIs his mom or FIL spouse still around and can they fill in the gaps? \n-\tIf a police report is filed, what does that actually mean for people \u201cfinding out\u201d? Police reports like this aren\u2019t generally just broad cast all over. You can probably control who learns about it from your on behaviors.\n\n**Once you have a police report**\n-\t notify the credit reporting agencies to immediately remove the debt. That\u2019s your first priority\n-\tDepending on the company money is owed to, they may send paper notification to \u201cFIL\u201d (aka his estate and the executor) to begin collecting from the estate. Or they may call. \n-\t**You can be proactive here and notify them yourselves.** That is also a form of damage control and limiting the spread of knowledge.\n\n**Be proactive**\n-\tcontact the companies yourself with the police report, a copy of the death certificate\n-\ttell the various people: notification of identify theft, and notification of death for culprit. Be very direct about these two points. \n-\tThen get into the explanation: we aren\u2019t paying, its fraudulent.

It's more likely than not that your husband is lying to you, and doesn't want to \"tarnish his father's name\" out of his own sheer guilt.", "Actually it wouldn't be seven years at this point.  The account will drop off once it has been on his credit report for seven years regardless of what has happen in those seven years.  Now if it is a judgements those will still sit on the report for only seven years but,  they can be renewed every ten years. After they are renewed they will show again for another  year.  Also the OP and husband needs to be careful if they contact the collectors. Debt collectors have ten years to file for a judgment and any contact can reset the clock for filing for a judgment.", "You are in the very lucky minority if you think 6 grand is a small price.", "You know that bad people die and continue to be bad people. This man was robbing his son in life, he shouldn't be allowed to do this in death.", "You guys are getting paid?", "Lol you took it too far, the dead man rolling in his grave because he got a permanent record now what's he gonna do, time? He got nothing but time to do while he's down there! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I'm guessing you missed the lesson to not be a dick to others.", "Okay man, whatever you say.", "He is a Jr. But FIL used my husband's DOB for all of the accounts.", "Yes, exactly. I also think sharing a name with a child is very tempting for a fraudster who doesn\u2019t *think of themselves* as a fraudster. All of this to say it\u2019s very possible FIL only did this to his son. \n\n(In any case, OP, NTA. This isn\u2019t even a debate. You do not need to protect the man who defrauded you, even if he is your FIL.)", "That is very true, but they would still not be his bills. If his father was alive, he would be able to take him to court if he didn't promise it as a gift. But my point was more the logic standpoint. Would he really get bills in his name for his dad, never tell his wife about them and expect for them to just vanish? When he was applying to own a home, he must have known they would check. I am more surprised he didn't check regularly himself.  The alternative was he was doing his dad a favor but didn't tell his wife & was too embarrassed to mention it until he had to and then doesn't want to \"tarnish his dad's name\" because of a moral compass of not accusing his dad of something he didn't do? If he was willing to hide something that large (6k in bills) from his wife, he has doesn't have a good moral compass. It's not impossible, but fraud seems more likely.", "Exactly. There could be vehicle(s) or other property that could be required to be sold to satisfy the debit of the deceased. Anything in FIL's name or proven he owned can potentially be up for grabs, and unless OP takes care of it soon, the creditors have every right to go after them to satisfy the amount owed. Was a shitty suprise, no doubt, but burying their heads in the sand and worrying about a dead guys name over their lives is just not a smart move.\n\nOP if you happen to see this: you can get free legal services and advice a few different ways. Your employers may have a plan that offers legal services, I think it's usually called EAP. Court clerks can advise you on where to find help as well. Clear your names, forgive the past transgressions, and move on to have a great life. Good luck and I hope it all works out for the best.", "No need, man ignore it, attention seeking behaviour, the fact you respond in a negative setting is what fuels that specific person, no need to degrade one another they know where they stand on an emotional and moral level, no need it pointing things like that out.", "That\u2019s what happened to my cousin. Fraud for sure, but the kind of fraud that is easy to brush off if you get caught. (\u201cOh, that was opened under John Smith JUNIOR, not John Smith Sr? So weird! I\u2019ll have to look into that!\u201d) \u2026 Unless, of course, you happen to be dead and it\u2019s just the wronged party finding out that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cmistake\u201d, you actually did knowingly use your son\u2019s DOB/SSN."]}
