{"id": 15724, "submission_id": "12zha3f", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to file a police report against my deceased FIL", "selftext": "My husband (m30) and I (f27) are preparing to buy our first home. We both work full time, making above minimum wage, but not enough that either of us can get a home with our single income. \n\nYesterday, in a conversation with the bank, we were informed that there are 4 collection's accounts in my husband's name, all going back to 2018. Power, internet, and 2 credit cards. After a few hours, we were able to link each of these accounts to his father's previous address. The bill is just shy of $6,000.\n\nAfter multiple conversations, we have realized the only way to clear this debt from causing issues to his credit rating is to file a police report for fraud. \n\nHis father died suddenly last September, and my husband doesn't want to tarnish his father's name and is afraid his family will look down on him for doing this. He is on the fence of how this will look if it gets out. \n\nI look at it differently, we took a massive hit paying for the funeral (FIL had no money, and no life insurance), I know it's his dad, but we will be years recovering from the implications of this. None of the recovery agencies are willing to give us a bill paid in full, and even if we do pay this debt we will loose the down-payment we have busted our behinds to raise again over the past 7 months. We aren't even close to having the buying power we had last September because we only saved about half of our original down-payment. \n\nSo, AITA for asking him to make the police report. It's not an ideal situation, but how much more can I let his father's poor financial decision in life impact our future, especially now that he's gone?\n\n*Clarification for some of the most repeated questions.*\n\nAs some of you might have gathered, yes, my husband has heritage reasons for trying to honor his father even in death. He is also a Jr.\n\nHe is an only child and was raised only by his mother. His father did not sign his birth certificate, but was a large part of his life.  His father's estate is gone to probate court to be settled. \n\nBecause of his accent and his dislike for confrontation, my husband actually had me speak to everyone yesterday. Collection agencies did not have our address or his phone number, which is why we have not  even hounded. Everyone I spoke to has told me they have had no success in reaching him since they acquired the debt. So no, he wasn't hiding something. He didn't know.\n\nWe have had complications with the credit bureau for the last 3 years trying to access my husband's credit report. We have had to go to the police station and show several pieces of ID, send in letters to confirm his identity. It took the banks to get us to do everything again to resolve the issue. Originally, we thought it was because there was no activity on his credit report. Now we know that at least one account used his father's SSN with my husband's DOB and created issues. \n\nFinally, for those people who want to know what the price of my bad feelings are, I just paid 18000 out of pocket to make sure this man wasn't buried in a cardboard box. I loved my FIL, and had he told us about his financial struggles, we would have helped him. This isn't even about the money. Yesterday, I asked every agency if they would just put paid in full next to the bill, and I would pay it off. I'll save the money again. They wouldn't take the collections off his credit score. It's not 6 months worth saving that I'm concerned about. It's 3-5 years that that record can stick to his account, which will stop us from purchasing any time in the near future.\n\nFinally, my husband needed a minute, but he called me today at lunch and said he has to do what is right for our future. He is going forward with the fraud report this evening. \n\nThank you all for the reassurance \ud83d\ude4f \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1682515041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zha3f/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_file_a_police/", "score": 7902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While heirs of an estate don\u2019t inherit debt, the estate still needs to pay said debt and if the heirs took an inheritance in any way (money, assets, retirement accounts, etc.), then the heirs become liable for the debt from the proceeds of the estate. \n\nIf the estate is truly empty and nobody took an inheritance, then the debt collectors are SOL and have to write it off.

If his father was alive, he would be able to take him to court if he didn't promise it as a gift. But my point was more the logic standpoint. Would he really get bills in his name for his dad, never tell his wife about them and expect for them to just vanish? When he was applying to own a home, he must have known they would check. I am more surprised he didn't check regularly himself.  The alternative was he was doing his dad a favor but didn't tell his wife & was too embarrassed to mention it until he had to and then doesn't want to \"tarnish his dad's name\" because of a moral compass of not accusing his dad of something he didn't do? If he was willing to hide something that large (6k in bills) from his wife, he has doesn't have a good moral compass. It's not impossible, but fraud seems more likely.", "Exactly. There could be vehicle(s) or other property that could be required to be sold to satisfy the debit of the deceased. Anything in FIL's name or proven he owned can potentially be up for grabs, and unless OP takes care of it soon, the creditors have every right to go after them to satisfy the amount owed.

It\u2019s a huge deal. \n\nI absolutely understand where OPs husband is coming from, but that doesn\u2019t mean OP is an AH", "Yeah that's a very good possibility I hadn't thought of. Son might be in on it and could be implicated in this fraud", "There is no estate, otherwise they would have probably used it to pay for FILs funeral instead of digging into their own savings/house deposit.", "No- just relating what happened when I was in a similar situation. Despite having proof it wasn\u2019t my bill- I still had to pay it. \nLaw Enforcement isn\u2019t going to just take a report for a crime where the accused is deceased and there is nothing that can be done about it. \nIt\u2019s not likely to resolve the problem with the credit report or the delinquencies. \nTheir best option is to talk to their mortgage bank- and the creditors, and the credit reporting agencies to see if there is any solution. It\u2019s likely they could work out paying a percentage of the balances in exchange for a settled report being made to the credit reporting agencies. \nThey can also file a letter of dispute to the businesses and the CRAs- but there is no guarantee that they won\u2019t be made to pay some or all of it . \nThe letter of dispute requires the lenders( bills/credit cards) to prove her husband incurred the debts within 30/60 days. If her FIL used his SS info though - they may claim he had proper authorization and they have to pay. \nThat\u2019s what I was told after going through all the steps.", "I'd wonder if he might have done it to one of those other family members who might not even know.", "Even if they put up, OP's husband's credit will not be fixed unless they file a police report. (Spoiler alert: it might not get fixed anyway, but there's a better chance.)", "Honor in committing fraud against your own son?", "There was a thread not long ago where that happened. Everyone kept their story silent til the dam broke", " It\u2019s why people steal and defraud family members, because if they get caught, the crime may not be reported.", "I do wonder, is there a possibility that OP's SO knew about this or even authorized it but didn't stay on top of his dad to make sure things were paid?", "Husband's family might want to check their own credit scores", "Not to mention the dad had absolutely no issue tarnishing the son's reputation and ruining his future when he executed the fraud. The father knew exactly what the outcome would be for his son when he did this.", "If the dad actually had the sons permission, and the son never told his wife, that'd count as shady. \n\nI'd assume it's just a case of \"awkward to file charges against family\" but good to verify there isn't more to it", "If the estate is still open then these debts need to be brought to the executor immediately.", "It\u2019s the husband choice. It\u2019s not the wife\u2019s father. Husband doesn\u2019t want to. You can\u2019t blame someone for there choices.", "Do you have the link?", "I don\u2019t know if you have done this already.  But once you have a credit report, for each credit card or other debt that your FIL fraudulently took out in your husband\u2019s name, write the credit reporting agency and dispute the debt, stating the fact that the debt was fraudulent.  It\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nYour main concern here is to get these debts removed from all of your husband\u2019s credit reports.  Paying them off will NOT help because the credit reports will still show your husband didn\u2019t pay on time for each of these debts.  \n\nYour husband can request a credit report from each credit reporting agency once a year for free.  Have him request a report from every agency, Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian.  There is more info here.  https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/consumer-reporting-companies/", "My thing is if you\u2019re planning on doing it anyway why bother asking. At that point just do it and tell them you did it if you want.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to let their opinion inform whether or not you do it then by all means ask. I wouldn\u2019t though, that\u2019s a fuck ton of money. I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019d need permission for something like this, it really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the family system.", "The victim very clearly did not omit that piece of information, so neither should you", "Did not omit what information??", "The guy isn\u2019t going to just do that because he cares about what his family thinks.\n\nThat piece of information was crucial to the story.\n\nSo omitting that part and just saying who cares what anyone thinks is clearly narcissistic.", "INFO\n\n> He is also a Jr.\n\nHave you asked the credit reporting companies if this is legit?  It's pretty common that Juniors get their parents debt accidentally placed on them.  \n\nUsually the reporting companies can just have it removed.  \n\nThis is why it is ***horribly irresponsible*** to name your child a \"junior\" name.   People who do this don't care about their kid's future in today's day and age.", "NTA. I'm not sure where OP lives but generally if a debt has gone unacknowledged for 3 years then it will have prescribed,  at least where I live.", "NTA - It is entirely possible that this is confusion at the credit bureau.  I have a common name which my son shares and our credit gets cross-linked all the time.  It is entirely possible your FIL had a legitimate debt that he didn't pay and he never intended it to get linked to your husband.  Happy to see that your husband is doing the right thing for the two of you, but it is entirely possible that even your FIL didn't do anything other than dying while in debt.", "NTA. My mother (almost 70 and still living) did this to me when I was in college. I am now in my mid-40s, and it took me 15+ years to get out of the financial havoc she wreaked on me. One of the credit card companies told me I would have to open a fraud investigation. I didn't feel that was the right thing to do to my mom, but looking back, I really wish I had. My best to both of you.", "From someone who the credit companies confused me and another combining all of the debt to me, I wish you luck. At the time it happened to me it was almost unheard of. It took 12 years and our second house to finally get it all cleared. Thankfully this person was paying his bills! As we hear more and more of these problems, they have made it easier to resolve. Tell everyone That these companies confused the two but being the father is deceased this is your only option.", "If your husband is a Jr., it's possible that it's a mix up, or it can at least be disputed as a mix up. It might be an easier route than filing a police report.", "This may not be matter of fraud.  My husband is a II and when we went to buy a house, they told us we already had a mortgage on my husband's credit.  Turned out, the credit bureau didn't even bother with DOB or SSN and put my FIL's mortgage on my husband's credit.  It took a bit of work to get it straightened out, but once we did we got our mortgage no problem.  Even if it is actual fraud, NTA either way.  While I will always show respect for the dead, I will always take care of the living first.", "NTA. Get an estate lawyer.", "You may want to try disputing these items through the credit reporting agencies first.  There's a very good possibility that your FIL did not use your husband's social to open these accounts.  Credit Reporting Agencies are notorious for cross-contaminating SR/JR credit reports.\n\nDispute the validity of the debts, the CRA will go back to the creditor and make them verify the SSN and other pertinent information.  If the SSNs don't match, they tradelines will be removed from your husbands credit report.\n\nIf they confirm it is in fact your husband's social, then follow through with the police report.", "Glad to hear that your husband agreed to go forward with the fraud report! I think you're still going to have a struggle to get your credit report cleared. But at least it's a step in the right direction.\n\nI wanted to note though that defaulted accounts stay on your credit report for 7 years from the date of the default. That means if you start making payments on these bad accounts, they'll stay on your report even longer. You'll basically be reactivating them.\n\nSo the best thing is to try to get these bad accounts cleared off your credit report with the credit bureau or the collection agency. But if the agency tries to get you to even make small monthly payments, know that that will affect how long it stays on your credit report.\n\nAlso the statute of limitations for taking you to court if they decide to sue you is usually about three or four years from the date of the default. So again, if you begin making payments on these accounts that would restart the statute of limitations date.\n\nSo your best bet is to try to get it cleared off your credit report without doing anything to make the account active again.\n\nAlso, here's a website that helped me a lot when I was dealing with credit report issues. A lot of very helpful people there who might be able to help answer your questions as you deal with this problem.\n\nhttps://www.creditinfocenter.com/community/\n\nGood luck!", "I went through an id theft of my husband's id of about $4000 of utilities.  OP is going to have to file a police report because technically this was id theft.  The credit cards aren't going to even listen without a police report.
