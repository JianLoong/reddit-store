Do you feel threatened by me?\"\n\n\"Some of your behaviors, like this Kpop thing are so different from how I've known you.  I'm not into it, and this new persona is making it hard to relate to my lifelong friend.  I miss how we were.\"", "You are not! You're at a reay young age and it's normal to find some people like that and then they will grow it out, but if she's annoying you maybe find a soft way to tell her that she's overreacting and if she stops talking to you\n1. Time will heal that when she realizes how dumb it was \n2.

Your girl friends will have varying crushes on different boys and make up all these rules that MUST be followed at all times.\n\nIgnore them, if you lose their friendship for a while, no loss.

And you talking to this boy doesn't do anything wrong (unless you like him too)", "I would say right now with those silly rules (especially \"don't think about him\") it's no big loss if she stops talking to you.\n\nIf you want to talk to or spend time with this boy, go ahead and do so.  She doesn't own him and has no right to tell others how they can interact with him.\n\nYWNBTA", "She is not your friend if she dictates how you can live your life. If she decides to stop talking to you after you set boundaries, it means she doesn\u2019t want to be in a friendship based on respect.

Being your age, things are almost always out of control. Your body is changing, your brain is changing, everyone around you is changing. She's essentially obsessing over this boy and she's trying to possess any kind of control she can. The problem is she's controlling other people. When you let her do that, it becomes more like a dictatorship and no longer a friendship. She'll think she can become basically your puppet master before long. You have to set that boundary with her. And if she doesn't respect that, then she's not a real friend. Honestly. And it'll hurt in the moment, but you'll eventually feel better because you stood up for yourself and you'll make room for new friends. But if she does respect you then great! You still have a friend you know who respects your feelings and boundaries. You got this \ud83d\udc96", "NTA.  Your friend is not only annoying, she is very weird.  Her trying to isolate her BF from other people is just plain wrong.\n\nThis is not your imagination; she is inappropriate.", "Yeah, but it\u2019ll really be hard to say this to her because I love her she is my life long friend", "No I don\u2019t like him he is like my best friend", "But like we are friends since kindergarten so it will really affect me because I don\u2019t have a lot of friends beside her", "Alone with just her, and in a way that she knows she is upsetting you.  This isn't \"I hate KPOP\" but \"I feel us drifting apart because I can't keep up.  Help me strengthen us.\"\n\nIt isn't, \"You can't tell me who I can and can't speak with.\" But rather \"It feels like you don't even trust me.\"\n\nThis way, you are showing your friend what makes you sad, and asking for her input on how to strengthen your friendship.  I hope it works out.  By 13, I had moved away from all my childhood friends, and often wonder about them.  If she is set on becoming something you can't join, part on good terms.  Let her know you'll still be friends, even if not BFFs.", "should i say it in her face or in message", "To her face, in a place that is historically for the two of you.  Your house, her house, or someplace where you both feel safe and alone.  This is a quiet, heartfelt plea for the sake of your friendship.  There cannot be others to bust in, mocking, distracting, etc.\n\nAlso, by text is very bad for this, because what if she has gone so far away and you didn't realize, so she is showing her new friends (or your soon to be ex-friends) the text and mocking you.\n\nVulnerable conversation should always be private, quiet and focused, giving it the reverence needed."]}
