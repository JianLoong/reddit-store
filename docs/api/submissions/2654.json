You said you told her politely to not pet the doggy, nothing wrong with that.  If her mother wouldn't have let her run in the grocery store in the first place, the encounter never would have happened.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lesson that can\u2019t be taught to a child too early. Setting boundaries for kids to learn from is a basic part of parenting. Sounds like that kids mom needs to chill out and be more respectful.", "NTA\n\nIf she is so insistent that that you \u201cneed to let parents take care of their kids\u201d, then she needs to freaking *do it* and parent her child.  Her kid shouldn\u2019t be running up to service dogs and distracting them.  \n\nService dogs aren\u2019t some pretty art exhibit for people to enjoy - so many people (yeah, adults too) think that you can stare, take pictures, talk to, make faces/noises at, and otherwise distract a service dog, *as long as you don\u2019t pet the dog*.", "NTA. Sounds like that mom is a little off. Do you have a sign on your dog that says DO not pet? If this happens a lot, and you care to do it, it would be cool to have little pieces of paper that explains why this is bad to do \u2014 I\u2019d really like that!", "NTA.  \n\nKids need to learn that service dogs are doing a job, not there for fondling.  If their parents won't teach them that, it's left to the owners.", "NTA I had to stop bringing my service dog with me in public because of encounters like this. I had a GROWN MAN yell at me for not letting him pet my dog in a store because I asked him to stop calling my dog to him after MINUTES of having to reset her in a stay while trying to check out at a store. He kept yelling about what a terrible life my dog has because I wouldn't let her go to him. So now she has to stay home instead of going everywhere with me because it was too much for my anxiety disorder.", "NTA. I thought it was common knowledge not to disturb a service dog. People are morons.", "NTA.\n\nKids are unpredictable, and most kids WILL want to pet the \"nice doggy\" - and have no clue what a service dog is.", "NTA. That poor kid\u2026 that mom is going to be a wreck her entire life. And her mom won\u2019t be doing her any favors with that kind of intervention.", "NTA.  If it happens again then tell the parent you won't direct their child when they take the responsibility to not allow their child to run up on you and your service animal.  That she was negligent in her care and you hope she can do better in the future as you whole heartedly agree, the world should not have to be responsible for parenting her child.", "NTA.\n\nMany service dogs have vests that say they are a service dog and to not touch them.  Hope you have such a vest.  Your actions were only protecting you, your dog, AND the kid.  Your comment was fine as long as it was said in a civil manner, which I'm guessing it was.\n\nThe mom was out of line.  She can't be positive what her 3 or 4 yo would or would not do.  And she obviously wasn't keeping close enough tabs on the kid.  She would have had a major fit if her kid been hurt by interacting with your dog.", "NTA", "NTA in the slightest. It was reasonable to assume the young child was running up to pet your dog.\n\nThe mother is a major TA however for not trying to explain this situation to her child.", "NTA, at all. One thing I have absolutely harped on with my kids is that working dogs/animals are working, and they\u2019re not to be interrupted. Any dog ever, they know they have to ask the owner before approaching the dog, because we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re working or friendly. Your dog is working, not at a dog park. You\u2019re in no way TA.", "NTA\n\nOf course not. You had no way of knowing what the child was going to do. They had obviously run away from their parent. I seriously doubt that you were as aggressive towards the child as the parent was to you.", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen parents get like this in other situations too. Rather than getting offended that someone is telling their child \u201cwhat not to do\u201d, I wish more of those people would teach their kids about being respectful, socially aware humans, that understand and respect boundaries when they are communicated to them. Because it shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal at all to say this.", "NTA. Highlights magazine did a really good article years ago about what a service dog does and why we shouldn't bother them. I wish they would reprint it as a book because I would 100% teach that at school.", "NTA. She totally overreacted and you have good reason to say what you did", "NTA - when my son was little we taught him to ask someone if their dog was working before approaching a dog. When he was too young to understand, it was my responsibility to keep him close and not run off. \n\nYou handled the situation perfectly. Some people can't handle hearing that their child is less than perfect. Don't let her bother you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was walking pups home the other day and there were four probably 8 year olds walking towards me. I crossed the street, they crossed the street. I crossed again, and one kid started yelling \"PUPPY\" and running towards my dog. My dogs are awesome and love kids, but what if they didn't?

But this parent has got some serious issues", "NTA - Mom has no way of knowing whether or not her 3 yo was going to pet your dog. You have experience that indicates there was a good probability that she would.  And with a service dog, you don't want to wait until after the fact to issue the warning as by then, the damage is done.  It's like telling someone, \"Lookout! Wet floor!\" after they have already slipped on it.", "NTA. Any parent that allows a kid to run up to any strange dog is s total idiot and should not have kids. They don't know that dog, how it would react to a stranger or if it bites. What is wrong with these people? They are risking their kids' faces being torn off because they are unable to use common sense. My sister adopted a small dog that looked cute and friendly. She had been badly abused and if anyone tried to touch her or startled her, she would attack. It took over a year for me to be able to even pet the dog and she lived in my house.", "NTA\n\nSo many people do not know and by extension do not tell their children the purpose of service dogs and you must always ask to pet someone else's dog especially if they are working.", "NTA far too many people don't understand you shouldn't touch dogs without permission so a polite request is totally fine", "NTA at all. People need to learn that SERVICE DOGS ARE OFF LIMITS.  They are there to do an important job and should not petted and be distracted by random strangers.  Not the kids fault but her mom is certainly an asshole.", "I have friends with service dogs and follow people on social media with service animals. They have those patches, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Entitled people still try to pet their animals.", "Sad thing is: I have more stories like this. Had a grown ass man run down the store aisle screaming \u201cdoggy\u201d while waving his arms, then got butthurt when I told him to not touch her. Had a woman walk past while talking to my dog, I politely asked her to please ignore her, because it could be catastrophic, and she proceeded to yell at me for bringing an aggressive dog around (catastrophic meaning if my dog missed a cue because she was distracted, it would be a bad day for me). Had a teenager ask why I have a service dog, and her mom proceeded to berate me when I calmly and politely told her that that question was rude (my exact words were \u201cyou\u2019re not supposed to ask that\u201d). Had yet one more woman get snarky with me when I said I had a \u201cnon visible disability\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to share my info with a rando, and she kept saying \u201cI don\u2019t understand what that means, what do you mean non visible disability\u201d and wouldn\u2019t let up until I told her it was PTSD (she basically bullied me into telling her). Had a guy claiming to be a dr give me the 3rd degree asking why I have a service dog. Had another guy basically say there was nothing wrong with me and I didn\u2019t need a dog. Yet one more guy got snarky \u201cwhy does SHE get to bring a dog into the store?\u201d. I order most of my groceries to be delivered, if I can, I don\u2019t like going out in public because of all of this.\n\nSome days I\u2019ll do everything I can to make the person questioning me as uncomfortable as possible, most days I just want to be left TF alone to do my errands and get back home", "Even without the vest, children shouldn't be touching random dogs in public anyway.", "I love kids, and on a good day if a kid asks politely I\u2019ll let them pet her, this was not a good day, nor was the kid asking (at 3-4yo they know how to ask to pet the doggy).

It is/should be at the owner's discretion.  You can get patches that say \"Service Dog, Ask to Pet\".  We are in the process of training our puppy to be a service dog for our daughter so his patches currently say \"Service Dog\"  \"In Training\".  Once he is properly trained, she doesn't mind allowing people to pet him, but only if they ask and we'll change out his patches when that time comes.  But I do agree, if their patches simply say \"Service Dog\", it's hand off.", "Ugh.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had these experiences. People can suck.\n\nI live in a very dog centric town and it surprises me how entitled people feel to pet other people\u2019s dogs in general.\n\nA friend raises guide dog puppies and most people ignore the jacket, think it doesn\u2019t apply to them and that they should be able to pet, talk to or coo over the cute puppy. It\u2019s maddening.\n\nI always thought it would be funny if we could train them to growl at people who approach when they are wearing their jacket. \n\nI wish I could come up with a sarcastic and funny comeback for you. Someone more creative than me can probably give you some great ideas on here though. Then you can just have a couple of phrases on lock and continue on your way. \n\nMaybe something like,\u201dSorry I have violent explosions of temper and he keeps me from murdering nosy people who get too close.\u201d\n\nBest wishes. And please don\u2019t let the ignorance and judgement of a few AHs impair your ability to get out and enjoy your life.", "Sorry to hear. For the nosy people who ask you why you have a service dog, have you tried just saying, \"That's private.\" Can your dog wear a vest that says Service Dog?  Or \"Do Not Pet\"?  The first time I saw a service dog, I was a kid, and I did not know what a service dog was or that that it was bad to pet them. It should be parents that are educating their kids so you don't have to deal with this.", "Ever since my niece was old enough to talk, she has known to ask \"Can I pat him!?\" from a distance to get permission before approaching a dog.\n\nSome dogs don't take kindly to being approached by kids, so this woman's kid was already perhaps out of line, depending on how close she ran.", "Huge YNTA. Parent needs to parent.", "I said that earlier.", "Thank you for educating me more on this!"]}
