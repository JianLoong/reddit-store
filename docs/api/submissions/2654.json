Service dogs/ dogs in general should not be touched without the express permission of the owner. PERIOD. And since little children can't keep their hands to themselves quite yet there is nothing wrong with a gentle ASK. Mom sounds nuts.", "With small children, education is key. \"No, Susie/ Tommy(or whatever name) you may not pet my dog because it's his job to keep me safe and distracting him could cause me to get hurt.\"", "NTA\n\nDidn't even need to read the story. You have a service dog and someone tried to touch it without your permission.  Always wrong!  \n\nYour service dog is not there to entertain children -- it's working -- and the kid was interfering.", "NTA. It's been how long that service dogs have been a thing? Everyone should know by now that you don't pet service dogs. Unless they live under a rock. Which might be true for that mom. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, that woman sounds like a psycho.", "NTA. My kids know not to touch other people\u2019s pets. The entitlement of the parent and her child is ridiculous.", "NTA. This happens to me as well, and my puppy in training once got so overexcited that she's knocked a pushy kid down before (he was fine but we all gasped, she's not aggressive but she doesn't know her own size). Fortunately in that case the parent didn't blame us.\n\nPeople looooove service dogs. x.x", "Ahhhh SHIT.\n\nI'm so so sorry.", "I am so sorry. \n\nI shouldn't be surprised at how deeply dickishness runs in some people. Running down an aisle yelling \"doggy\" and waving his arms? Badgering you about your disability??!! WTactualF?", "Much less making loud noises and running toward them.", "This is an excellent point", "Obviously, no child is responsible if an animal attacks them. However, teaching children how to behave appropriately around animals, especially unknown dogs, is so important. You don't know anything about that dog's history.\n\nThe dog owner is responsible for controlling the dog but tragic and avoidable accidents happen when parents miss this stuff.", "She knows she\u2019s adorable, too, and uses it to her advantage, lol. She\u2019s so incredibly smart, and she remembers what she\u2019s done, before, to get what she wants out of me, lol. She\u2019s actually a life saver, so I\u2019d do anything for her.", "Businesses are **legally** allowed to ask two questions to ascertain whether it's a real service animal - \"Is the animal necessary because of a disability?\" and \"What service is the animal trained to perform?\". This is spelled out in the Americans With Disabilities Act itself.", "Aww. I love that! Give her an extra treat and a pet from me! I'm so glad you have each other!", "Me too! Idk what I did to deserve her, but I\u2019d do it all over again in a heartbeat, lol.", "NTA, but it IS possible that you're being over protective due to your past experiences. Kids do like to run around a lot, and make lots of noises. So it's entirely possible that the mother was right about what her daughter would do. It doesn't matter at all though because it doesn't justify her response, there's no reason to be bothered by an adult saying a reasonable thing to their child.\n\nShe could have just used it as a reminder to her child to not run in the store and that service dogs are off limits, and that you should ALWAYS ASK before touching any dog you don't know anyway. Instead she lashed out at you for some reason.", "NTA.\n\nThe mom is, though. *Obviously* the kid was coming to pet your dog. What, she ran closer for just a look? Mom sounds like a peach. Don\u2019t lose any sleep over it.", "Service animal or not, it is never appropriate to touch someone else's pet without permission. My ES cat is leash trained, so people want to pet her when she is on my shoulder (only places she's allowed, for those who want to come at me assuming I treat her like a service dog). I defer to *her* consent, based on her mood. And if that lady had actually been watching her brat, then she would know why you told her to keep her mitts off your dog.", "NTA. \n\nToo many people out there don\u2019t know the rules about service dogs. \n\nNow if you were mean or ignorant about it that may be an little issue just because they\u2019re so young, but it sounds like you were completely reasonable and within your rights as a service dog owner. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to face that so often in the world. I wish there was more education and understanding about service dogs and disabilities. Honestly I wish you didn\u2019t have to tell anyone at all and everyone just respected that the dogs are working and can\u2019t be bothered for your health and safety. \n\nYou did what you could to educate calmly and the lady escalated it in a completely uncalled for way. You are NTA but she was.", "I like the cursey words for situations like these. You were so much nicer than I would have been and you are NTA.", "You saved that kid from getting their hand bitten off in the future. I don\u2019t have a service dog. I have a heeler. A kid comes running up to my dog too close and  that kid will get bitten. Kids need to absolutely learn not to approach ANY dog without caution and permission.", "NTA - \u201cOh? Why else was she running at me like a screeching fucking goblin then? Mind your fucking kids so I don\u2019t have to.\u201d", "NTA it is the job of parents to ASK not to assume. And a service dog is not a pet when it is working. The child was riunning to pet the dog. She knows it and you know it. Her joob was to parent the child.", "My kids love dogs\u2026 and know to approach slowly and politely ASK if they can pet the puppy\u2026 this should be common practice. NTA", "Things like this is why I almost chewed out a couple the other day in Lowes that brought in a dog with them that was wearing a vest that resembled a service vest and they had put patches on it that said \"Pet Me\". My 8yo saw and tried to duck around the corner to pet it. When I stopped her, because I didn't get a good look at it when they walked by and thought it was a service dog, she said \"but it says pet me on it.\" It was until I saw them in the parking lot when driving away that I saw it in full.\n\nNTA at all, especially when there's assholes out there like these deliberately trying to confuse kids.", "YTA, honestly people with service dogs have become crazy. I sat in the doctors reception with my daughter and a lady was in there with her service dog. She just kept starting at us clearly hoping and waiting for my daughter to be interested in her dog so she could attack. Unfortunately for her, my daughter wasn't remotely interested in her dog and she didn't get her chance to yell at a child that day. I don't blame the mum for yelling at you if you deserved it. Just because you have a service dog doesn't give you the right to yell at anyone that looks in your direction.", "It\u2019s because they\u2019ve been marked \u201cspecial\u201d by the federal government, and they\u2019re so well behaved, people can\u2019t help but be drawn to them. It\u2019s a pain in the ass most days, lol", "But she didn't yell at the child and they weren't in her general direction. The kid ran up to her. OP had every right to tell the kid not to touch her dog because that's why MOST kids run up to a person with an animal by them, so it was appropriate for OP to assume that's why the child ran up to her. The mom was out of line for yelling at OP.", "The mum said she wasn't going to touch the dog though and if they're in shopping lane kids are going to run past.", "Indeed. It\u2019s always up to the owner. We have patches for our pupper stating \u2018I am a Thief\u2019 so everyone who meets him is aware. No service dog hopes here. :) \n\nBut in all seriousness the owner should always be asked first and their response should be respected.", "Yep, this was my older service dog for a while. We had to work with her to train her out of her fear response. She would get harassed as a young dog at the grocery store by toddlers while their parents did nothing.", "The vest makes her cuter. People absolutely go nuts for service dogs because their purpose does make them the bestest.", "Stores may NOT ask, \u201cwhy do you have the service dog\u201d.  That is asking for the Dx, is not one of the 2 questions, which is why I said they can\u2019t ask that. I\u2019ve actually read the relevant parts of the law, have print outs of the old FAQ and revised requirements in my purse, although I haven\u2019t read the new pages carefully, yet. I think they have just come out of, or are about to come out of beta.  They have been labeled as coming for at least a year.  I don\u2019t believe there is new info, just supposed to be a better format.  Oh, and I also read the whole damn thing when the new DOT/~ AACA~~ ACAA regulation came out.\n\nETA one of these days I\u2019ll remember it\u2019s air carrier access act, not American air carrier act. But I\u2019m not holding my breath.", "NTA - some parents are nightmares.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve been told from the age of three that under no circumstance is a service dog to be pet without the express permission of the dog\u2019s handler, which has only happened to me twice on my life. I don\u2019t know much about service dogs but I do know that they are incredibly focused and intent on their duty, which is you, and they don\u2019t need a screaming toddler in their face.\nThat girl\u2019s parents, and all parents, need to instil into their children that you can\u2019t just touch every random dog, or just stuff in general, that they see. That\u2019s called setting boundaries. And honestly what parent lets a little kid run up to a strange dog?? You were entirely within your rights, they were out of the line and major AH\u2019s.", "NTA. I remember many encounters like this when I was a kid (obviously older than the one in this post), and my mom reinforced the no-pet rule. I\u2019ve also had issues in public where I needed to reinforce an interpersonal boundary to a child because their parent wasn\u2019t doing it. Of course I want to let parents parent their own kids, but when they don\u2019t and it affects me, I\u2019m gonna say something. If a parent doesn\u2019t like that, then they should be aware for next time of their need to step in before a stranger has to say something.\n\nETA: the one and only time I pet an animal after I was told not to by their owner, I got bit in the face and nearly lost an eye. (It was a campground, my mom wasn\u2019t immediately around. And in the end my mom was mad at me, not the dog owner. And it wasn\u2019t an aggressive dog, I was just a naughty, antagonistic 3 y/o.) Imagine how the grocery store parent would\u2019ve felt if this wasn\u2019t a service dog, but someone\u2019s random anxious pet and that had happened.", "NTA- My daughter has a service dog and one thing we learned when we put the do through training is no one outside of the household should touch the dog. I\u2019m betting your dog ad a vest that pointed stated service dog.", " NTA, I\u2019ve full on told people to eff off and not touch my SD when I take her out. Sometimes when people pet her I start petting their hand too, they get creeped real fast", "the kid also could have been easily bitten", "Have you ever met a kid? \n\nDo you know what the kid was thinking? Does the mom know exactly what their child was thinking? No. OP was 100% in the right to assume the screaming child running towards her was going to pet her dog. Stop trying to justify a mom\u2019s poor behaviour."]}
