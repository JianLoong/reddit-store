I'm the kid who always helps. I've basically been wired to never say no. So when my mom's childhood best riend's son asked me to make a wedding card and portraits for his brother's upcoming wedding, even though I didn't want to, I said yes. As it so happened, I took up a job soon after that which was extremely demanding and required me to work 12+ hours a day. It was exhausting and I barely had any time to myself. Some weeks pass and the son reaches out to me, sending details of what needs to be done. I let him know I'm really busy and I can't take up the job. It also really icked me out that he was really condescending when asking me to do the work, like he was doing me a favour by giving me a project? I let my mother know and she instantly seemed a little off, but she knew how busy I was so she said it's fine. \nA few days ago, my mother's friend calls her. She's talking about the wedding planning, and she suddenly brings up the fact that I didn't do the card. My mother apologises and tells her how busy I am. She said smn along the lines of \"it wasn't that big a job that she couldn't have done it\". After that day, she's been weird and curt to my mother,barely responding to her texts and not answering her calls. My mom's told me atleast a handful of times that I should've just made the cards and that I've caused a rift between her and her friend. \nAITA?\n\n Edit: \n1) I told her son I'd do the project only if I did have the time in the future, and I did tell him I might be taking up a job. So he did have fair warning. \n2) the amount of work told to me before and the actual amount of work were very different. I was first told to make portraits. I was then told to make an e-invite, as well as printed cards, including the designing,layout and illustrations for each and two portraits each of the bride and groom.\n\nI know I put my foot down for the right reasons but I'm just upset that it affected my mother and her friend's relationship. And I also know they found it really hard to find someone to get the work done after, ultimately settling for somethig quite dull.", "created_utc": 1695810745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tgymn/aita_for_not_making_my_moms_friends_kids_wedding/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not fair to expect you to leave the large amount of work that you have, to work on a wedding card.\n\nShe is not entitled to your time. Did she hire you for the job ? did you sign a contract ? did she pay you ?\n\nIf the answer to all of those is no, then no your are NTA. Tell your mom that you are working on your project and don't have time to just \"make the card\", and if you not making the card caused a rift between them, then it wasn't much of a friendship anyway", "NTA but you can\u2019t expect people to treat you well if you don\u2019t enforce your own boundaries. You should have taken the job and told them it was going to cost X amount, or you should have turned it down. And when you got the other job, you should have either followed through with what you had agreed, or told them you couldn\u2019t do it. People only take advantage when you let them.", "NTA, but you are going to need to develop a quick \"no\" response to hand out when asked for favors like this, because it will keep happening. Some people who are not artistic imagine that what they are asking of artists should be no big deal. They don't see the work that goes into producing a painting or drawing\u2014the years of practice it takes to even get decent at it\u2014but feel that your talent has just been magically bestowed on you, and that you kind of owe it to them to share it. The scope of work these people wanted from you is ridiculous, but it's not the last time you'll face these kinds of expectations, so you want to get good at standing up for yourself.", "NTA.   Your time is important and you did what you were originally asked to do.   \n\nNow you know how much went into the portrait I would come up with set rates as this will happen again.\n\nMy Mom used to \"volunteer\" me to do calligraphy and sewing, crosstitch, etc to others and now wonders why I say no all the time.  I was never paid and hounded until the project was done by her as she thought  it was taking too long.   She is the least crafty person I have ever met.   Please start saying no for your own sanity.", "NTA - You said no, they just wanted someone to do something for them cheap to save on money.  And the customer was rude to you.", "They wanted something for free, then they wanted even more...for free. You're NTA. And your mom shouldn't be helping her \"friend\" treat you badly.", "Info - do they have time for a plan B? If you backed out last minute putting them in a difficult situation then e s h but if they have time to find someone else then n t a.\n\n>I've caused a rift between her and her friend.\n\nHer friend caused a rift between your mother and herself. \n\nLearn to say no. But start with this: every time someone asks you to do something just tell them you'll think about it and get back to them later. And if you don't want to, say no. And if they pressure you for an immediate response, say no. If they ask why, \"no is a complete answer\".", "ESH\n\nI get what you're going through. As a professional artist, I get suckered into doing a lot of things. The difference is, if I say yes to a project, I do it. I don't say yes, and then back out weeks later. And I know, it's a lot of work. This is why you have to learn to say no. But you just mildly suck for doing this.\n\nYour mom's friend and sucks big time. Why? For diminishing what you do in such condescending fashion. She would have been justified in being annoyed if she had remained polite, but it sounds like she is actively pushing that you should have been able to do it anyways. \n\nThe friend's son gets a milder suck judgment for being condescending early on. He likely DID think he was doing you a favor, but he needs to wake up.\n\nYour mom is the only one that really did nothing wrong. She stood up for you, but wishes you had followed through because now there's this rift that is at least partly your fault.", "YTA.  You can't even get your story straight.\n\n1. \"even though I didn't want to, I said yes\"\n\n2. \"I told her son I'd do the project only if I did have the time in the future\"\n\nWhether or not you got \"the ick\" is irrelevant, because you said yes and they heard yes.  This is an emotional event for them so not all words are equal.  You have to understand that about people.  They hear what they want to hear, and they heard this is taken care of, will probably be a great deal, and we will get special treatment bc our mom knows their mom.  \n\nThe professional way to do this would have been to both say, \\*and then follow up in writing\\* that you won't know for sure if you can take this job on until date X and you understand if they want to shop around first.  Because anything less then a hell no, they are going to treat as a hell yes.  \n\n\" I might be taking up a job\" is not fair warning.  Did you call them back immediately when you got that job and update them?  It sounds like you just left them hanging while you worked on the job and hoped they would go away.  The minute you thought you are overbooked you should have told them and given them another name.\n\nSo now they are pissed, they have to hunt down one more person to do a task they thought was covered, and they handle it poorly.  And of course they minimize what you do because they have no idea.  Every artist deals with that. They suck too.  But really, this is on you for not being clear and not covering your butt with paper.  You absolutely have to cover yourself.  That would have saved mom's headache.", "Slight YTA. Not for not doing it, but for saying you\u2019ll do it and then backing out, which is a sucky thing to do for everybody involved. Mother\u2019s friend, and mother, are the bigger AHs here though.", "ESH - things happen and vendors have to bail - it\u2019s part of the stress of the wedding and make for stories later. They should be able to understand that you\u2019re working 12+ hours a day and wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on the card enough to do it justice anyway. \n\nBut you also made an agreement and blaming someone else for your inability to say no is childish.", "ESH, except your mom. I understand and sympathize with your difficulties with saying no. That said, you didn\u2019t say no. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you didn\u2019t want to do it, you committed to it and then backed out. It would have been different if you backed out when you took the new job, but you waited until they followed up with you; until they now had to figure out a new plan on a ticking clock. You left them in a bad spot, and you earn asshole points for not living up to your commitments.\n\nOn the flip side, it sounds like your mom\u2019s friends share in society\u2019s general disrespect for the artists whose services they need, and that earns them asshole points, too. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big a job\u2026\u201d is one of the most dehumanizing thing you can say to a creative person. It untrue and it\u2019s unfair. If it wasn\u2019t that big of a job, then they could\u2019ve done it themselves. Artistic work is always a bigger job than non-artists realize, and to be so dismissive of it is just a kick in the mouth. But they really proved themselves as assholes by punishing your mom for it, like she had anything to do with it. They are clearly bigger assholes than you.\n\nI understand your mom\u2019s frustration though. You backed out of a commitment to her friends and now her social life is suffering as a result.\n\nEdited for grammar and emphasis", "Esh - a yes if under duress put them in the spot of having to make alternate plans", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
