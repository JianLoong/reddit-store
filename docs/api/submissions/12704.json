While I agree it\u2019s ridiculous- (in my opinion) His potential anxiety and embarrassment is no less relevant than the partner\u2019s.

There is NOTHING inherently creepy about a human purchasing items meant for human use. You\u2019re incredibly immature. 32?  Are you sure?  I know 12 year olds with more maturity than you\u2019ve shown yourself to have.", "Sheesh, There's a lot to unpack here.....", "first of all, you're 32?  why does this sound like a petulent 14yo?  do you not buy your gf tampons or birth control too?  \n\ndude grow the fuck up.  if money was the problem then you should have made an effort to atleast shield her from view and bought the skirt for her, or shielded her from the employees customer view when she bought it herself.  you sound like a child dude.\n\nreally really weaksause stuff here\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyes, you are the asshole.", "YTA- this is relationship ending behavior. She might have had piss or nasty water soaking through her skirt and undies, you should have ran into that store and bought her exactly what she wanted asap!", "YTA... Why are you so immature that being around women's clothing makes you this uncomfortable? To say that you may get weird looks or look like a creep... No, you wouldn't. Men have bought gifts for women for centuries. Sometimes, those gifts have been clothing, even lingerie. \n\nGrow the fuck up and help your girlfriend when she needs you. I mean, really, if you had sat in dog shit wouldn't you want someone to help you procure alternate clothing. You wouldn't want to walk into a store to shop with shit on your pants... OP, you need maturity and empathy....", "YTA. How is buying clothes for your girlfriend at her request a creepy thing? If you have kids can you buy your daughter clothes when she's a preteen and into adult sizes?", "YTA\nOMG GROW UP", "WTF did I just read?  You are infinitely creepier than you would be it you bought a skirt for your girlfriend.  This is too weird. YTA", "My boyfriend goes right in the store doors and asks out loud hence being on FaceTime where is the feminine product aisle no shame. He gets pads n panty liners shit he even came out with a pack of new underwear\u2019s showed a worker my body type she gave him the right size to. Even brought back the teddies.", "NTA, she bought her own which should have been what her plan was to begin with.", "YTA\n\nget over it and go buy the skirt. Havent you bought her tampons or pads yet?", "Thats some extreme insecurity you have to work on, YTA", "Wow. YTA. My husband buys me more clothes than I do. And he is great at picking size for me. My oldest son, no issues running to the store and getting period products for his GF. Both feel fine in their masculinity. Neither are embarrassed. And how have you made it to 32 still thinking there is something wrong with this?", "YTA, you\u2019re a full grown man, be mature. It doesn\u2019t matter if it wasn\u2019t piss, she was obviously upset and asked you to do a simple thing because she was uncomfortable. My dad goes and buys me tampons an underwear if I bleed through them. At your ripe age you should be able to go into the store and buy your gf some underwear.", "YTA. Dude, my husband goes to the store and buys tampons and underwear for both me and our daughter. You're an adult, not a child. You should've at least gone in there with her. That was humiliating for her.", "Lemme guess, you'd never buy her tampons if she needed them either YTA", "YTA- so simply put. You are the asshole.", "\"or at least come in the store with her\"\n\nSeriously what the fuck? You being afraid to buy your GF clothes is one thing but you don't even want to be vaguely associated with the purchase of her clothes. This is absurd. \n\nYTA.", "I have no idea how you have somehow turn it in your head the men buying women cloths it's creepy. YTA.", ">the creep that buys women\u2019s clothes\n\nNo one is going to think you\u2019re a creep for buying a skirt and underwear. You should\u2019ve accompanied her or bought the clothes for her. Also the liquid being brown doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not pee. If you\u2019re dehydrated, your pee can look brownish. YTA.", "YTA\nNobody gives two hammered fucks if you buy women\u2019s clothes - who do you model yourself after, some midcentury caricature like Fred Flintstone?", "Yta", "YTA jeez and I thought my 24 year old cousins fragile masculinity was bad when he refused to step into Victoria secret to buy lotion with me", "YTA bus stops are disgusting even if it wasn't piss she had to change her clothes, you're lucky she didn't leave you there and went home, I thought this story was about teenagers then I re-read the age, Im still convinced this is an immature teenager \ud83d\ude44 she was vulnerable and you didn't help her in anyway, if she doesn't dump you she won't be considerate in your relationship anymore because you just showed her how much you consider yourself to her, she can obviously forget about asking you to go get pads or tampons \"it's be too embarrassing\" your 32 grow up", "YTA.", "YTA", "YTA and super immature and insecure. You need to grow up.", "What repressed country does this guy live in where men are viewed as creeps for buying women's clothing?", "YTA you are not a creep for buying your girlfriend clothes. You are suppose to be a grown man. Get over it.", "I stopped after you said you didn't want to seem like a creep buying women's clothing. Weird...YTA.", "YTA \n\nLMAO too embarrassed to buy clothes! What am i reading here?\n\nnext level stupidity", "What? YTA, my boyfriend is extremely awkward in public places but yknow what, he\u2019s still bought me underwear and pads when I\u2019ve needed them. You\u2019re 32, my bf is 26. GROW UP.", "So you were going to buy her men's pants? Because buying women 's pants would still be a man buying women's clothes.", "Was she going to change her clothes at the bus stop?  She had to go in the store anyways to change.  That said, you should feel comfortable buying a skirt. Could have been a gift or you could tell the salesperson the story if it made you uncomfortable. Literally no one would care. Not sure anyone\u2019s an AH but you both need to use your brains a little better.", "It's 2023, whether you're buying a skirt for your mum, sister, partner, brother, uncle or yourself no one gives AF. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nStop thinking that it's creepy for men to purchase women's clothing. No one cares. And even if they do, what the fuck does it matter? Your ego and sense of self must be *extremely* fragile if you think it's unseemly to purchase women's clothing as a man.\n\nAnd you also basically told your GF that your insecurities are more important here than she is; she needed help but you couldn't get over yourself to be there for your partner in something minor, what's going to happen when it's something major?", "YTA for sure.", "YTA\n\nWhat are you? 12?", "Off topic but it's also weird that he doesn't use contractions.", "I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have absolutely no problem buying her lingerie, though.", "Agreed. And hell as a trans woman who is constantly worried about being judged for buying clothing, if my girlfriend had been in that situation I still would've gotten her the skirt in a heartbeat. OP is the asshole and is also a coward.", "OP is absolutely the asshole but this isn't helping, the stigma around *wearing a certain type of clothes* is what creates this pressure in the first place.", "I got my period unexpectedly when I was in Mexico. I was in a hotel room and had nothing with me. My boyfriend just asked me what I wanted and walked to the store to buy what I needed. I thanked him and apologized. We were young and I felt embarrassed. He just said \u201cit\u2019s no big deal. No need to be embarrassed. They\u2019re obviously not for me so people will just assume that I have a girlfriend that I take good care of.\u201d I was so impressed by that mindset.", "She could have desperately needed him to get her sanitary products and he would still be a total AH for refusing to buy them because he felt embarrassed", "BWAAAAAAAA!!!!", "Imagine what he is gonna be like as a parent, \"oh I can't buy kids clothes and nappies, someone will think I'm a creep\"", "My partner is trans as am I and their fave thing to do is buy tampons and when someone congratulates them for buying it for me, they look them dead in the eye and say \"no these are mine\" and just leave them to figure it out or not its fucking great.", "Well did he win?", "When i worked retail there was often men buying women's stuff and vice versa. Of all the weird things that happen in retail, that was not one of them. Most people are just going to assume that you're buying for your partner and probably wont even say anything.", "As a guy who's been buying these products for family members since i was a teen there's never been shame. There was a whole lot of initial confusion however at the sheer amount of variety in that aisle.", "Dude i know a guy who gets squicked out buying supplies for his daughters.

Where was she intending to be while you went and bought them?", "NTA for not buying the skirt, it's not like you ruined it beyond use - it just needs a wash and she can wear it again. However your attitude to buying things you perceive as women's items is really immature. You seem like the type of guy that would freak out if asked to buy tampons and that is a red flag for a lot of women.", "NTA. Shes a grown ass woman.
