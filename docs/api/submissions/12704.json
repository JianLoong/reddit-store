She helped him pick out a perfectly coordinated outfit.  The only thing he didn't buy was the dress shoes because he wasn't sure about the size or fit.

While I agree it\u2019s ridiculous- (in my opinion) His potential anxiety and embarrassment is no less relevant than the partner\u2019s. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to automatically label someone a misogynist or transphobic because they don\u2019t want (albeit hypothetical) negative attention from being in a space they don\u2019t feel comfortable. Those labels these days are pretty dangerous, this isn\u2019t that deep and those are loaded labels. She\u2019s an adult and she sat on something, there was nothing afflicting her to where she couldn\u2019t be an adult and handle it, which is ultimately what she did as she wasn\u2019t incapacitated.

I bet the partner would as well but she may not have the hangups.
