The range of colleagues who attended this conference was pretty varied, ranging from fresh faced grads, to established workers, to senior managers.\n\nThe company paid for certain activities (including specific dinner events), but they didn't cover this particular one (because it was organised in an impromptu fashion after one seminar which a bunch of people, myself included) attended.\n\nI will add, that there had been no prior agreement or arrangement discussed in terms of how the bill would be split. My expectation would be that either everyone pays for what they consumed (plus an appropriate tip), or everyone has an agreed number of courses and drinks and the bill gets split. \n\nDinner was great, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. There were about 20 of us at the table, mostly younger guys. Now, the younger guys were absolutely putting the drinks away - many, many beers and bottles of wine were consumed. Personally, I only had a couple of soft drinks because I was driving, and I know a few other guys were as well.\n\nBy the time the bill came, someone worked it out that we were due to pay approx \u00a390 per head if the bill was being split evenly. I had kept track of what I had had, and my total came to around \u00a345 (including a %15 tip). I could definitely afford the higher split, but I kind of objected on the grounds that I'd be paying double the price of my meal to cover someone else's bar tab, and I voiced these concerns to the group.\n\nA few people complained, saying that I had made things awkward for everyone,  and I suppose that may have been the case - but if the situation had been addressed at the start of the meal (which is the real failing here), its possible more folks would have decided that they wanted to take a drink at dinner. \n\nThe next day I was chatting to someone who knew the manager of some of the folks in question,  and they had apparently continued drinking and continued complaining about the situation after we had all parted ways after dinner. I felt kinda bad because I suppose some of the younger guys aren't on as good salaries as some of the senior/manager types, and they'd have appreciated the \"free bar\" so to speak. \n\nAITA for objecting to an even split of the bill?", "created_utc": 1685041719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rqde3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_a_dinner_bill_evenly/", "score": 1286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it's a company of 30-50 people, sure, you may have a point. But in a company of 100+ people it's going to be hard to keep tabs on a group of 20 when you have so many other employees. But that's assuming that a manager knows, which I'll get to. Even if they did know, this event was organised by the individuals, after a seminar, to be had after the day had finished. This is clearly outside of work hours and the company isn't liable. Like i said before, if I tell my manager me and buddy X are going to a strip club, we go to said strip club and assault a dancer, it's not the companies problem. Or a more common example, after work drinks. If someone drinks too much after work with coworkers and gets into an accident, the company will not be liable since it's not in the scope. \n\n>Once a manager knows about it- the company \u201cknows about it\u201d.\n\n>By splitting the tab, the manager may be buying drinks for other team members.\n\nIt doesn't seem like there were any managers there. The only mention of a manger was OP speaking to someone (who knew the manager of the guys drinking) after the event and the guys who were drinking have a lower salary than the mangers/seniors so they would have appreciated a free bar. I'm under the assumption from this & the fact it was an impromptu thing that there were no managers involved. Otherwise I'm sure OP would have said a few young guys and some mangers attended the dinner. \n\nAnd no, you can only appeal a verdict so many times (usually once). The court doesn't entertain playing tag with verdicts, and if it's a case of a corporation vs an individual, the corporation will always outlast the individual (unless they come from serious money or the corporation is very small)."]}
