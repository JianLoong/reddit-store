The range of colleagues who attended this conference was pretty varied, ranging from fresh faced grads, to established workers, to senior managers.\n\nThe company paid for certain activities (including specific dinner events), but they didn't cover this particular one (because it was organised in an impromptu fashion after one seminar which a bunch of people, myself included) attended.\n\nI will add, that there had been no prior agreement or arrangement discussed in terms of how the bill would be split. My expectation would be that either everyone pays for what they consumed (plus an appropriate tip), or everyone has an agreed number of courses and drinks and the bill gets split. \n\nDinner was great, and everyone seemed to be having a good time. There were about 20 of us at the table, mostly younger guys. Now, the younger guys were absolutely putting the drinks away - many, many beers and bottles of wine were consumed. Personally, I only had a couple of soft drinks because I was driving, and I know a few other guys were as well.\n\nBy the time the bill came, someone worked it out that we were due to pay approx \u00a390 per head if the bill was being split evenly. I had kept track of what I had had, and my total came to around \u00a345 (including a %15 tip). I could definitely afford the higher split, but I kind of objected on the grounds that I'd be paying double the price of my meal to cover someone else's bar tab, and I voiced these concerns to the group.\n\nA few people complained, saying that I had made things awkward for everyone,  and I suppose that may have been the case - but if the situation had been addressed at the start of the meal (which is the real failing here), its possible more folks would have decided that they wanted to take a drink at dinner. \n\nThe next day I was chatting to someone who knew the manager of some of the folks in question,  and they had apparently continued drinking and continued complaining about the situation after we had all parted ways after dinner. I felt kinda bad because I suppose some of the younger guys aren't on as good salaries as some of the senior/manager types, and they'd have appreciated the \"free bar\" so to speak. \n\nAITA for objecting to an even split of the bill?", "created_utc": 1685041719, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rqde3/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_a_dinner_bill_evenly/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not fair for people to drink more and you have a glass of water and a Caesar salad, or something not as expensive as others, because they think the check will be split. \nThey have appetizers, mains and desserts, as well as many cocktails. We receive our check and pay our own tab; usually people who have not had such expensive tab follows suit. The one\u2019s who were trying to mooch freebies were the one\u2019s who objected the most!", "I think OP owes even more, as they had to continue drinking to assuage their put upon state.", " I hate supplementing other people's large alcohol bills. NTA.", "If they really wanted to drink more and are staying at a hotel, they could buy their own at a store and call it a day. Much cheaper than the alternative. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA - you are not there to fund their meals or drink tab.", "NTA I bet that\u2019s why they where throwing so many back at the time.", "NTA then they should have done this at one of the dinners that were paid for! Lol wth", ">When you're at a work event drinking- the company is liable. If you get in a car and damage property or hurt someone- not only you/your car insurance, but the company is liable.\n\nThat's unlikely, it's not a work event so the company would be fine.", "I agree!  \n\nThose who thought the check should be split evenly are the ones who were drinking \u2018above their means\u2019 aka expensive drinks they thought someone else (the company) would pay. \n\nOP is not TAH for calling them out by having everyone pay for what everyone drank. Especially since it\u2019s not something the company covered. \n\nNTA", "Some nicer restaurants will not split a bill amongst 20 people at a table.", "yeah I don't get this either. lots of stories where the tab keeps coming on one bill. is one person speaking for the group and asking for that one bill? whenever i'm out with a big group the waitress always asks and that's your opportunity to let her know your paying seperate, or let her know at the start. even if one person says 1 bill. the only time I think it's ok for their to be 1 bill is if someone is offering to pay for everyone at the table. \n\nthere was one time we did a split bill and like nobody put in extra for the tip so I had to throw in an extra 20 bucks for the whole table because they were cheap assholes. i felt that wasn't even enough but I had literally no cash left, I was overpaying my portion too. never again I said.\n\nNTA", "Yes, it\u2019s like someone orders lobster and bottles of wine and you order pasta and soda water. And they\u2019re like wtf? I thought we were splitting the tab?!\nNTA", "In tyool 2023 tabs are already fully tracked electronically and can be paid with a tap of a card or some phones. It takes almost no extra effort for each guest to pay individually. And servers are way more likely to get stiffed on the tip with a single bill.", "I don't think OP is in the US, so I don't know how it works where they live, but in the US if you had a party of 20 the tip would already be on there automatically since it's a big group. I'm totally fine splitting the bill when it's more or less equal between people (or even a few dollars off) but I'm not paying twice as much as I ordered because other people at the table wanted a ton of alcoholic drinks.", "If you imagine a sliding scale from 1-10 where they are 1 and managers are 10, I'm probably around a 4.", "Paying only for what you order is the default. I can't believe people even have the gall to ask for the entire table's bill to be split evenly.", "I\u2019d agree if everyone was drinking and eating roughly the same amount. If he\u2019s had two soft drinks and they\u2019ve been downing wine and all sorts I wouldn\u2019t be paying for that.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to single out the non-drinkers and divide the rest of the tab. I\u2019ve been on both ends of this and wouldn\u2019t let someone who didn\u2019t drink to subsidise my bender, and I\u2019d be pissed off if I had to pay for somebody else\u2019s when I\u2019m stone cold sober.", "Paying only for what you order is the default. I can't believe people even have the gall to ask for the entire table's bill to be split evenly.", "Salary aside, each should have been prepared to pay their own way. NTA.", "First sentence \"work conference\"- anything in the service of your employer or promoted by the employer to attend is work related, and they are liable.", "Disagree it always turns into a shit show for the waiter if not requested prior they have to go around the table at the end and ask each who had this who had that drink it is a pain in the ass for the waiter.", "You still have to ask for separate tabs up front if you want them.", "This exactly. The headline would read XCOMPANY EMPLOYEE blah blah blah. \n\nNTA, my friend. Someone had to inspire disruption.", "Yes, the conference was a work event. Certain dinners were funded by the company, if it was during one of those funded dinners they'd be liable, but this is on their downtime. That's like going to a strip club during this conference and trying to claim it as a work related expenses because you're on a work trip. \n\nThis was a dinner that was not organised by the company, not paid for by the company, not on company time and was not mandatory for employees to attend. It is not work related.", "Where? I\u2019ve been to a couple places with large groups. The waitress always asks at the end who is grouped with who.", "Look into Respondeat Superior Liability, that will illuminate you to employer responsibility for employee conduct.  It even applies when an employee is leaving home to drive to work- if the employee has an accident on their way to work, the employer can be held liable (like if the employee car insurance max payout is $1 million and they're sued for $10 million- the employer is the best place to pillage if you can make your civil case the employer was remotely involved).\n\nPeople aren't on the clock for their commute to work- but employer liability can apply.", "Again yes I am familiar with vicarious liability. An employer is liable for their employee **in the scope of their employment**. This is why when driving to and from work you can claim it on taxes and there's a liability risk. Because again, going to and from work considered under the scope of employment. \n\nYou're missing the point. Going to a dinner that is hosted by your workmates after a work event is not in the scope of anyone's employment. It hasn't been organised or paid for by the company, it's not a mandatory company event, the company hasn't invited anyone out. This was a dinner, after a work event, which the workmates themselves organised and paid for."]}
