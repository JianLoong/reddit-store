That's a big change and one that some people never adjust to. You can't control your feelings and there's nothing that says you have to love her. However, don't let this affect how you treat her.

So the issue is not your half-sister. The issue is that you don't like that your Dad remarried and started a second family -- and that part is understandable.\n\nI actually think you will find it easier to like your half-sister if you recognize that she didn't ask to get born any more than you did, and if you focus your resentment on the more relevant subject which is your Dad. He could have remained single to focus on being a father to you, but he chose to remarry and open himself up to all that entails and open up you to the consequent disruptions of that second marriage.
