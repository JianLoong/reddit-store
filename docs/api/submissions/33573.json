My mother would constantly make remarks on my weight and none of that \"you need to lose weight for your health\" kind of advice, this woman would constantly call me a dog or a pig if I ate leftovers in the fridge or maybe I ate chocolates or sugary treats this woman would take them away and say stuff like \"You already look like a pig, do you really want to upgrade to elephant?\" Mind you this was before my teenage years.\n\nWhen reached my teenage years/ dating age she made sure to remind me that no boy would ever look my way because of my weight, my confidence and self-esteem being at an all time low, I began cutting myself and that went on for about 2-3 years before I got help and moved out I was 19 by then and I went no contact with my mother the minute I moved out.\n\nI probably should have mentioned that I have an older brother(29) and to be fair he has always been my defender and protector against my mother but there is only so much a person can do. This year my brother asked me to go to a family gathering this past Saturday, he never asked that of me because he knew of my situation with my mom but this time was special for him, he was going to introduce his girlfriend who I've met before and who he plans to propose to on Christmas day to our parents. He needed my support and she needed a friend so I went. She is also a little plus sized and on this dinner my mother made no efford to disguise her disgust that my brother would ever pick a \"fat\" girl that's not up to his standards to date, she made constant fat jokes all directed at my brothers girlfriend and no matter how much he begged her to stop or told her that he loved his girlfriend she just wouldn't stop so I got tired of it all, stood up and told her that she was a sorry excuse for a mother, I called her a fatphobic emotionally abusive bitch and told her that if she doesn't fix herself in time she's gonna die alone with no one by her side. Then I stormed out of the house with my brother and his girlfriend following closely behind me. \n\nEver since the dinner I've gotten calls from different uncles and aunts telling me how wrong I was for that, my brother stands by me and tells me that it was long overdue, he has also stopped talking to our mother", "created_utc": 1703259955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ohuvw/aita_for_calling_my_mother_a_fatphobic/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was long overdue. Your mother and her supporters sound toxic beyond belief. No right thinking person should be defending your mother. Where were the rest of the family when your mother was tearing you down all those years? They stood by silently. Then they did the same when your mother was tearing down your brother's girlfriend. Shame on all of them but YAY for you. This internet stranger is proud of you!", "NTA! Abusers need to be called out. The family members who are siding with her are just enabling her abuse - if they won't listen to your brother's or your side of the story, cut them out too. Good for you for standing up to an abuser!", "Nta and if she is smart she will heed the warning. When you are shitty and judgmental to everyone around you there ceases to be anyone around you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Block them all, no need to connect with any of them. Brothers going to have a small wedding\u2026", "NTA. By being critical about your weight your entire life, your mother inadvertently (or maybe purposefully) caused you to use eating to cope with her horrific treatment, turning this into a cycle of peril. Your mother has turned fat into not just a bad word, but an abusive one. Run away and never look back. Shoutout to big bro for being awesome. You can still be loved by others regardless of what the scale (or shitty mom) says."]}
