My brother finished getting ready a couple minutes before me and kept pushing me to hurry up. It took no longer than 5 minutes for me to finish. We ended up with more than enough time to get to the party. We left at 5:00 and it was a 15 minute drive. We were all set to arrive early until my brother stopped at a smoke shop. Our parent don\u2019t know that he smokes, they never specifically told us no smoking but I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t be happy. Especially since my mother\u2019s father passed away from lung cancer. \n\nThis one stop would have been fine if my brother didn\u2019t take a long time in the shop. We went from being early to being late. It was around 5:25 when I finally saw my brother in the checkout line through the window and we still had about 10 minutes left of the drive. When he finally got back to the car he shoved the bag in the glove box. \n\nOf course after that little detour we arrived late and our parents were furious. They asked us why we were so late. My brother with absolutely no hesitation said we were late because I took forever to get ready. I look at my brother feeling completely betrayed. My parents then started to scold me but before they could get too far I stopped them and said the real reason we were late was because my brother had to stop at the smoke shop before we got here and you can find all the evidence in the glove box. Now it was my brothers turn to look at me with betrayal. My parents told my brother he was in big trouble when we got home. For the rest of the party my brother was giving me dirty looks. \n\nWhen the party ended our parents went straight to his car and found the evidence. When we got home they searched his room found all his smoking stuff then grounded him. Later that night my brother confronted me and called me an a**hole for throwing him under the bus. I defended myself saying he threw me under the bus first. He could have told them he had car trouble, there was traffic or he got lost but no the first thing he thought was to lie to get me in trouble. He\u2019s response to that was that our parents would have only been mad at me for at most a day but now he\u2019s grounded for a hole month. He\u2019s been cold to me for a week now. Maybe it would have been better for me  to have taken the blame because by now everyone would have forgotten about the party and everyone would be happy but instead our parents are still angry and my brother is mad at me.

Ignore him, he made his own bed by lying. Who cares if his feelings are hurt? Those with dirty hands shouldn\u2019t point fingers.", "They grounded him? He's 19 years old. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28\n\nOh, NTA.", "NTA, he outright lied about you.  What else would he lie about?  If he accidently left the smoke products in a place other than his room, would he put the blame on you?", "Hm, why oh why would adults who were raised with agency and respect for their own rights ever agree to be grounded? Oh I know! Because they weren\u2019t raised with respect to their growing autonomy and never allowed to exercise their rights. Jesus when the answers are caught between \u201cwhat a dumb ass for allowing it to happen!\u201d and \u201chuh I wonder if they\u2019re forced to accept it\u201d why is your immediate response laughter and to blame someone for being subjected to something that indicates an unhealthy dynamic?", "Seems a bit tone deaf. An adult with a supportive upbringing and healthy parent-child dynamics would not need to be \u201cgrounded\u201d in the first place. In a normal, not abusive household this would have resulted in an open discussion where all parties would feel able to voice their opinions (eg \u201cI don\u2019t want you smoking in my house\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m of age to smoke and pay rent\u201d). Additionally, the fact the brother\u2019s immediate response was to shift attention to a target who would receive a \u2018lesser\u2019 punishment speaks to the potential that he has likely had to \u201cconfess\u201d to things he never did just to get his parents to shut up, that avoiding punishment at all cost was the safest option for him growing up to the point that it\u2019s an ingrained habit versus a conscious choice, and generally just that he\u2019s had to learn how to navigate his parents\u2019 unreasonable reactions. Such as getting \u201cfurious\u201d when they were 5 minutes late. \n\nJust that one factor quite obviously paints the parents as obsessive, controlling people, the likes of which do no favors to the development of a person\u2019s ability to be independent. Especially since the whole basis of abuse is control, and parents have control since day 1, it\u2019s common that abused children, minor and adult, expend the majority of their energy in just avoiding blow-ups or managing their abusers\u2019 moods.\n\nI think the brother is a jerk for sure, but it\u2019s painfully easy to see how the abuse has pushed him to act in these toxic ways. For the sake of OP and her brother, I hope they\u2019re able to get away from their parents and into therapy. The true AHs here are the parents; all of this backstabbing and back and forth to throw each other further under the bus is just toxic sequelae that stems from Mom and Dad being controlling AHs.", "A curfew at 18? If you live in a weird baby land maybe.", "You understand how abusers actively inhibit their victims from leaving their control, right? That\u2019s not lost on you, right?", "I think it was more like 10 minutes (still insignificant, warrants a \"sorry we are late\" and that's all) but I thought the exact same thing. They were meeting at a party, no way everyone turns up on time. These parents aren't helping their kids turn into functioning adults if they are micro managing their lives :(", "\"My house, my rules\" applied when my adult children still lived at home. However, there is no way I would have grounded them. I would have told the \"smoker\".. \"if you can afford cigarettes you can afford to pay/pay more rent\", OR, as I did when my 22yo son started having a few beers every night after work \"it's easy for this to become a problem, and I can't enable that, so if you want to keep living here, you have to stop drinking every night. I just can't stand by and watch you develop a habit that is very difficult to break and has many health consequences down the track\".", "No.  There are families that like to maintain different standards.  They might value family, study, and growing their resources so they can have good lives later.  They might value a respectful environment where if the parents are working and sacrificing to provide the house, then the kids shouldnt come home at 230am drunk and wake at 11 o'clock in the morning, and should respect their subsidised lifestyle, do some chores etc.  They might wish their kids to not waste money on drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol, when they should be saving and studying so they don't end up on antiwork or incel groups in their mum's basement.\n\nThere are others who make no effort at school, drink til 230am from 18-25, have no standards or guidelines for their kids at all,  and then suddenly realise they have shit lives, shit jobs etc, and then they blame it on the people who have made better choices.  \n\nIf you have grown up in one way, you might think the other way is strange.  If they have grown up in their way, they might think you are strange.", "Try telling that to my indian family...", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\n\nI have to say I LOVE that analogy *sooo* much I just pissed off the cat! Dead asleep & me laughing out loud startled her so bad she's now glaring at me from the back of the couch across the room.... Fuckin hilarious!! \n\nHave a great night & thanks for the laugh!", "Sadly it sounds like the parents are the little children in this scenario.", "NTA. He started it by blaming you.", "OP and brother left on time.  Most likely the brother knew he had a stop to make, but did not share this with his sister, then tries to throw her under the bus.  Brother is the AH.", "So its ok for him to lie and blame you so you are the target of your parents anger, but it's not ok for you to tell the truth, and your brother to get in trouble over something he actually did? And in reality, it the whole thing only happened because of your brothers poor planning? He could have gone to the shop after the party. \n\nNTA", "All of yall need to fucking grow up. ESH.\n\nYou both act like toddler's and your parents treat you like ones too.\n\nHe is 21, that makes him an adult. A say over his own life and habits. Did he lin the drama on you? Yes it was a dick move. \n\nAlso how late were you guys? It seems like you were only 10-20 mins late which isnt the end of the world and you all overreacted on that part.\n\nAs for your parents... They treat you like kids. Grounding a 21 year old? Wow I stopped being grounded at 13 and I didn't even get grounded more than once. Your oarents are controlling and aholes. I would have rather walked out with no plan on where to go than live another second with them.\n\nI get some  parents dont like seeing their kids drink, smoke, date, swear or whatever it maybe but at the end of the day you accept it because they are an ADULT!!! God your brother for grounded smoking lol thats crazy.", "Grounded a 21 Yr old? Wtf....control issues much", "Nta ... why didn't your brother say you had car trouble instead of throwing you under the bus", "ESH, I'm shocked you're 19 and 21. This is something that would unfold with a 14yo and a 12yo.\nYou both need to grow up", "Your parents seem like overbearing psychos. Grounding a 21 year old man is absolutely ridiculous. You sound petty and immature.\n\nWhy were your parents FURIOUS? Because you were 20 minutes late to a party? Who shows up on time to a party anyway??\n\nYour whole family is weird. ESH. Grow up, for your own good.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour brother\u2019s habit is what got him in trouble. It was also his fault that the confrontation with your parents started anyway.\n\nHow late were you btw? Sounds like 5-10 minutes based on the math of your post.\n\nI hope you\u2019re working on moving out of there when you can, because your parents sound wild.", "They\u2019ve both been raised and conditioned to accept things that are beyond a shadow of a doubt unreasonable: exhibit A being 5 minutes late to a party and being furiously interrogated for it. This is not a household that enables children to speak up against unfair treatment. \n\nNewsflash, parents don\u2019t stop being jerks to their kids once they turn 18. There\u2019s no magic number where abusive, toxic or even just micromanaging parents give up their control over their children.", "Where does OP say he\u2019s unemployed or that it\u2019s weed versus cigarettes? \n\nAs for moving out, I can most assuredly tell you, it\u2019d be healthiest for OP and OP\u2019s brother both if they could move out. The fact they haven\u2019t yet speaks more about the parents than it does them.", "We ain't shaming adults who still live with their parents in this economy.", "Your parents are AH as well. You and your brother are adults and they have no right to do what they did\n\nAs adults with adult money to spend you and your brother can do whatever you want with your money.\n\nYour parents don't have the right.\n\nYour parents are nothing but toxic", "And from 18 on that should be negotiated between both parties, not imposed unilaterally by power-tripping parents.\n\nIt obviously needs compromise from both sides, and if compromise can't be reached then the now adult children can always move out.
