{"id": 14314, "submission_id": "12fycu7", "title": "AITA for outing my brother\u2019s bad habit", "selftext": "My brother (21m) and I (19f) were supposed to meet our parents at a party for 5:30. My brother finished getting ready a couple minutes before me and kept pushing me to hurry up. It took no longer than 5 minutes for me to finish. We ended up with more than enough time to get to the party. We left at 5:00 and it was a 15 minute drive. We were all set to arrive early until my brother stopped at a smoke shop. Our parent don\u2019t know that he smokes, they never specifically told us no smoking but I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t be happy. Especially since my mother\u2019s father passed away from lung cancer. \n\nThis one stop would have been fine if my brother didn\u2019t take a long time in the shop. We went from being early to being late. It was around 5:25 when I finally saw my brother in the checkout line through the window and we still had about 10 minutes left of the drive. When he finally got back to the car he shoved the bag in the glove box. \n\nOf course after that little detour we arrived late and our parents were furious. They asked us why we were so late. My brother with absolutely no hesitation said we were late because I took forever to get ready. I look at my brother feeling completely betrayed. My parents then started to scold me but before they could get too far I stopped them and said the real reason we were late was because my brother had to stop at the smoke shop before we got here and you can find all the evidence in the glove box. Now it was my brothers turn to look at me with betrayal. My parents told my brother he was in big trouble when we got home. For the rest of the party my brother was giving me dirty looks. \n\nWhen the party ended our parents went straight to his car and found the evidence. When we got home they searched his room found all his smoking stuff then grounded him. Later that night my brother confronted me and called me an a**hole for throwing him under the bus. I defended myself saying he threw me under the bus first. He could have told them he had car trouble, there was traffic or he got lost but no the first thing he thought was to lie to get me in trouble. He\u2019s response to that was that our parents would have only been mad at me for at most a day but now he\u2019s grounded for a hole month. He\u2019s been cold to me for a week now. Maybe it would have been better for me  to have taken the blame because by now everyone would have forgotten about the party and everyone would be happy but instead our parents are still angry and my brother is mad at me.
