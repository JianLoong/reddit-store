My kids knew better, and have been saved from a lifetime of being seduced by rampant consumerism. \n\nWhile my daughter's classmates are making a big deal out of not having a Stanley water bottle, she's been happily using the one she's had for years. If it falls or breaks, she'll get to pick out a new one, and she'll know to pick a reliable, well made one, versus the trendy flash-in-the-pan one.\n\nWe didn't have to worry about tantrums over licensed character bedding (they each have multiple sets of NICE bedding that has never had to be replaced because they \"grew out\" of something).\n\nAt this stage in their lives, we barely have to encourage them.

I also think it\u2019s fine you won\u2019t buy them any of that expensive shit, they\u2019re kids and kids grow, anyway. A lot of it won\u2019t fit long. I never suffered for not getting a new pair of the trendiest shoes or anything besides the cruel bullying that came along with it. Which did happen. A lot.\n\nBut refusing to let them have even *free* stuff is not the same thing, especially as they get older. You\u2019re right. You shouldn\u2019t base your purchases solely off of name brands, but it\u2019s real silly to avoid free things that they like based solely off not wanting your kids to be \u201cseduced by rampant consumerism.\u201d You instilled good morals, no? They don\u2019t feel it\u2019s *necessary* to have these things, so why is it bad to enjoy them occasionally? When I do well at work, sometimes I buy myself something nice, even name brand, as a reward. Not because of the brand specifically, but because I\u2019ve researched that thing, know it will be comfortable and/or will last a long time, and want it. That\u2019s the logic you want to instill. You did good, so you get to sit back and watch them make good decisions. \n\nAlso, because my mom was so insistent that I was allowed to \u201cexpress myself freely,\u201d even when I wasn\u2019t, we aren\u2019t close.", "I didn\u2019t think badly of your choices until this comment.

Sure some kids will throw occasional fits over the Dino shaped chicken nuggets but then the next week a different child may just want the green plate and not the blue one. I think it\u2019s 100% fine to choose your battles and choosing no branding is certainly fine, but let\u2019s not pretend this is a better choice than the battles other parents try to choose. It\u2019s simply a choice, one in a million in parenting, and they way your last paragraph reads, your kids are set up to judge the choices of others as less than. That sucks", "Omfg.

I raised my child also to not care about the brand, but literally not care so if it happens to be visible, great no problem, if it's hidden also no problem.

They\u2019ve also never asked for it.  We\u2019ve never had a Dino-nugget in the house.  I made all of their baby-food from scratch.  Their clothing from birth to age 12 had ZERO visible branding.
