If it falls or breaks, she'll get to pick out a new one, and she'll know to pick a reliable, well made one, versus the trendy flash-in-the-pan one.\n\nWe didn't have to worry about tantrums over licensed character bedding (they each have multiple sets of NICE bedding that has never had to be replaced because they \"grew out\" of something).\n\nAt this stage in their lives, we barely have to encourage them.

I also think it\u2019s fine you won\u2019t buy them any of that expensive shit, they\u2019re kids and kids grow, anyway. A lot of it won\u2019t fit long. I never suffered for not getting a new pair of the trendiest shoes or anything besides the cruel bullying that came along with it. Which did happen. A lot.\n\nBut refusing to let them have even *free* stuff is not the same thing, especially as they get older. You\u2019re right. You shouldn\u2019t base your purchases solely off of name brands, but it\u2019s real silly to avoid free things that they like based solely off not wanting your kids to be \u201cseduced by rampant consumerism.\u201d You instilled good morals, no? They don\u2019t feel it\u2019s *necessary* to have these things, so why is it bad to enjoy them occasionally? When I do well at work, sometimes I buy myself something nice, even name brand, as a reward. Not because of the brand specifically, but because I\u2019ve researched that thing, know it will be comfortable and/or will last a long time, and want it. That\u2019s the logic you want to instill. You did good, so you get to sit back and watch them make good decisions. \n\nAlso, because my mom was so insistent that I was allowed to \u201cexpress myself freely,\u201d even when I wasn\u2019t, we aren\u2019t close.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re wrong for your kid not wanting to be a \u201cwalking billboard.\u201d My mom used to say the same kind of stuff and idk if I agree with it, but it did lead me to finding the big logos extremely tacky. I won\u2019t wear them, I also don\u2019t like being a billboard. But that\u2019s for the individual to decide, and you\u2019re going much farther than that by not letting them wear stuff with their favorite media on it. Wearing stuff from a band/tv show/book that you really like **is** a good way to express yourself. Call it rampant consumerism all you want, but the first time I got a My Chemical Romance t-shirt was a moment I\u2019ll forever cherish. I had to jump through ridiculous hoops to find one that fit into my mom\u2019s standards, and it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I deeply cherish having the shirt even today because it was the first time I got to proudly display how much I loved that band!

I think it\u2019s 100% fine to choose your battles and choosing no branding is certainly fine, but let\u2019s not pretend this is a better choice than the battles other parents try to choose.

For example, as a tiny person from a big family, my mom had tons of bigger cousin hand-me-downs offered, which generally my mom had no choice but to accept.  Not everything suited me, and I was grateful when she sorted out the ones I would never wear (for her reasons or mine).\n\nI do wonder, had you previously mentioned your dislike of advertising clothing to your SIL? And if so, does she disagree with your attitude? If so, then her continuing to offer those clothing to you makes her a bit of an A. \n\nReally, you two should talk about it, and if you cannot see the value in each other's views, it might be more harmonious if she donates those advertising-orients things elsewhere (or let you continue to pass them forward, just in case one of those items is something your kids actually want).\n\nNote to the word police: the OP's use of \"graciously\" is, in context, correct. She is referring to her family, not herself, and by choosing that word, she is implying that multiple donations have been accepted without hesitation, even though there was a strong possibility that there would be unwanted items in the donation.\n\nNote to the freedom police: Nowhere did the OP say that here kids were forbidden to wear advertising. It seems from OP's post, the kids respect their parent's choices/worldviews, and that the parents allow the kids to form their own worldviews, and buy for themselves what they like. We don't know outright that the kids don't get a say in what's being re-donated, so it's kind of meaningless to project outrage without proof.", "NTA- These are things the SIL literally didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t use. You taking them, using them for clothes or rags, sorting through them, donating them, is still a lot of work she doesn\u2019t have to do. It doesn\u2019t seem like you need these things or ask for them, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking advantage of them by any means. It also sounds like this rule about the brands is a pretty well known thing about you, so her knowing this and giving them to you anyway is kind of shitty on her part because that means she either expects you to conform to her ways of parenting/thinking or she just wanted you to take care of them for her. I know the not wearing brands things isn\u2019t really the subject here, but I\u2019m seeing people being offended and talking poorly about that and just want to say that its not really that uncommon and not a snobby thing, as much as a way to stay neutral and not be as materialistic, not to say that\u2019s always bad, but not everyone wants to be shackled to the corporate agenda and constantly advertise for companies with greedy, hateful intentions.", "NAH Your family knows your kids don't wear labeled clothing.

My guess is that the top 10 replies to this thread are from people who do not actually have kids or get/give clothing donations on the reg. When you give someone a pile of clothes that they they have to look at, sort through, make sure they'll fit (...and when... 6 months? a year??), wash, and then possibly store until usable... this is not a small process, and you don't usually do it in front of the other person. I will say that I did this once for a coworker: it was very awkward to sort through all the baby clothes in front of her.\n\nAlso, this is kids clothing that they will use for anywhere from two weeks (NB) to a max of maybe a year, if they fit at all. It's not like... a car or something.  My guess is that OP's kids are under 10. People give hand-me-downs of stuff that is roughly worn (rag pile), covered in brands (OK, I'm guilty, I re-donate those also, it's my kid's preschool policy, those get re-donated), and other stuff that either doesn't fit or that you know the kid won't like.\n\nSomeone has to figure out what will actually fit on the kid and when, and my guess is that 99% of <10 year olds are not going to sort through the clothes with you.  \n\n\nAlso, unless you see this person every week or two, it is not feasible to just go hand them back off- and personally, if someone handed me back a bunch of clothes I'd be really disappointed that I'd have to figure out what to do with them.", "I think many commenters bone of contention is OP failing to tell the SIL what clothes OP would automatically reject so SIL can gift these desirable clothes to whomever SIL pleases, rather than OP just giving them away or turning them into rags.  OP took away the joy SIL had thinking she was giving her nieces and nephews desirable clothing that they would appreciate and SIL had every right to feel unhappy about that.", "YTA for using your kids as an outlet for your neurotic need to be special. You sound exhausting. \nInstead of scouring wardrobes for brand names to establish your counterculture cred in the most supercilious, elitist way possible, why not find something to do that matters? \nOver the past week, three young people in the US were shot because they mistakenly ended up in the vicinity of a nutjob with a gun. Think about all the good you could do if you took all the energy you\u2019re currently wasting on unserious problems and redirected it towards a very real one like easy access to guns.", "Okay, so I'm kinda on the other side of this story.  My kiddo is a couple sizes larger than their cousins, so I used to offer SIL the good quality items *for their kids* so that they specifically would benefit from them.  Family looks after family, right?\n\nBut after a while I realised that their kids never actually wore anything I gave to them.  And it's nothing to do with brand names (they wear plenty of those), or not accepting hand-me-downs (they wear those as well).  She'd go through and take a bunch of items, and then immediately give them straight away to someone else.\n\nIf I wanted to give them to some random person, or to a charity I support, then I would have done that in the first place.  If they'd gotten some use out of them for a short while and then donated them, that would be okay.  They were given to her specifically for *her* kids.  To my mind, taking them on the pretext that it's for your kids and then immediately giving them to someone else was a slap in the face.  \n\nSo now I don't offer anything to them, I either re-sell or give them directly to the charities I want to support instead.\n\nSo I can see both sides here.  If OP's SIL is off-loading outgrown clothes even though she's aware of OP's rules about brand names and styles, then she doesn't really get a say in what is used or donated.

Haven\u2019t revisited it in a long time so not sure how\u2019s it aged but it made me feel empowered about my own body and it\u2019s changes at the time!", "Baby socks are completely irresistible. And my sister's dog is obsessed with them so she's perfectly fine receiving dozens of them, then she doesn't have to worry when the dog steals the sock right off my niece's foot (or now that she's nearly 2, niece pulls them off herself to give to the dog). Dog doesn't eat them, just likes to toss them around and slobber on them.", "lmaoo but you sure remember that moment huh years have gone by and you still remember the disappointment of your mom not getting you those shoes the same way OPs kids are gonna look back at their childhood and be like damn my mom really was crazy", "yes absolutely agree about this book, i had it too and it was great!", "I literally think that\u2019s all this is. My husband used to be mildly upset by this. Like my dad bought my toddler son these horrendous light up character sneakers. My kid loved them. They were a gift. My husband was embarrassed to look like the kind of parent who spent money on branded shoes. I pointed out we didn\u2019t spend money, who cares what people think, kid is happy.", "Better than my dog who hoards them like someone who went through the great depression. \ud83d\ude02", "I find it weird that the husband donates company branded fleeces.", "I find it weird the kids can spend their own money but she doesn't let them look through the clothes themselves until she approves them.", "LOL excellent point.", "She's the parent. She gets to decide what she thinks is appropriate attire for her kids.", "Lol I don't think my mom is crazy.\n\nThose shoes totally were just a gimmick. My mom bought me much nicer shoes looking back.", "Op- No one wants to buy some random clothing with a company name on it that was given to you for free. Either don't take it or wear it. You're wasting clothes.", "Yes this one! I don't like spending money on branded clothing, but when hubby gets clothes with his work name on it then it's all good.", "Depends on where you donate though. OP gives to a place that people come to to get the clothes for free. The local church is not sending stuff off to developing nations like the large thrift places are.", "My husband has branded clothing with his company name on them because his employer intends for him to wear them as part of his employment when out and about on behalf of the company. Out at a golf tournament for work? Better be wearing the golf polo with the company logo. Have a presentation to a local municipality? Better be wearing that button up with the company logo on it under your sport coat.", "YTA.  Your kids can spend their own money to wear name brands but they can't were them for free as hand me downs?  Makes zero sense.", "YTA just bc your reasoning is bizarre. Who cares whether a T shirt has a logo or a character on it lol how stupid", "\u201craising your kids to be weary of consumerism\u201d is the best malapropism I\u2019ve seen in a long time.", "As person who is the dumping ground of used children\u2019s clothes, get rid of that shit! I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s a snob or not, she had no obligation to keep clothing she probably never asked for. \n\nI\u2019m bitter bc I have a bag of hand me downs from my SIL that my kids won\u2019t fit for another 4 years.", "I\u2019m only wearing pajamas and both the top and bottom have the initials stitched on the outside", "Exactly. SIL might have overreacted a bit but perhaps she was putting aside and storing those clothes for years and now feels hurt by your actions. Considering that it\u2019s not the first time, you should have asked her what to do with the clothes your kids won\u2019t use. She might have other friends who might want those. Try to put yourself in her shoes. Instead of insulting each other, communicate your principles reasonably and respectfully so that she won\u2019t offer you things you don\u2019t want.", "Yep. This is where her logic disappears and she is clearly wanting to be a contrarian", "What decided me was realizing how short childhood is. Am I really going to make it a thing and deny my child her Elsa shirt? No. She\u2019s in a big princess phase and it\u2019s not my favorite and I\u2019m not a Disney person but it makes her happy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to set limits (like saying, I won\u2019t buy expensive brands, etc) but this is so dumb because she\u2019s being anti consumer but\u2026 getting rid of fine clothes because they say old navy or whatever? I said this is another comment but I love getting clothes from people (free clothes! Reusing things! New to us! It\u2019s awesome) and the best part is when they have random Elsa )\n(Or whatever character) stuff thrown in. \n\nFinally, none of my kids are neurodivergent, but one went through a long stretch of having some sensory related issues with getting dressed. I began a hunt for clothes with his favorite things on them (ie dinosaurs). It made a huge difference and helped him so much. I didn\u2019t get cartoon character clothes at the time but I support any parent who does for whatever reason and OP sounds like such a snob for looking down on everyone.", "Exactly. When my daughter passed, my older sister took most of her clothing for her kids, and I said if it doesn't fit, donate it. She's held on to a few pieces because she now has memories with my niece and both her daughters. OP is TA for her reasoning for why she only accepts certain things because she could have told them from the start and those clothes could have been given to someone else instead of OP making the decision to donate.", "You can share your values but if they are something like this, a *personal preference* pretending to be a value, it should be their choice. Shit even your religion and other things should be something you teach them about, not something you force on them. \n\nOP is also hypocritical about it since it's TOTALLY ok to spend their money on it but they're not allowed to accept it 2nd hand. \ud83d\ude00 make it make sense.", "I don\u2019t necessarily agree with her dictating what the kids wear, but that\u2019s also not what this conflict is about. The conflict is between OP and the SIL, not OP and her kids. If the kids were upset, that would be a different conflict and different verdict. We have no way of knowing if the kids even care about these handmedowns.\n\nAlso the sub isn\u2019t \u201cam I annoying.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cam I the asshole.\u201d Lot of people here acting like it\u2019s a crime to be snobby", "Did she though? Did I miss that? I thought she told us about those rules and the SIL just already knew about them and made assumptions as to why the clothes were being donated.", "Also Op said I won't buy them but if they buy them and wear them I won't stop them.\n\nOP didn't buy the clothes so how is it any different than her kids going out buying the same clothes and then wearing them?", "Then why can't they accept a gift? How is it any different from purchasing those clothing?", "or allow other people to give it to them.", "Right?  She brags about her son wearing nail polish.  No doubt she\u2019d decry a girl for the exact same behavior, probably because it upholds the patriarchy or something.  The virtue-signaling reeks through the ether.  This woman could drain the f*cks out of hot shower.", "This. Let's face it, when we give hand me downs, we want them to be put to good use, otherwise we'd just outright throw them in the garbage. But the main goal is to get the clutter out of our house, and we have to realize we're making that clutter someone else's problem. Honestly there's no reason for OP to keep clothes she or her kids don't want only to spare SIL's feelings. Hard NTA.", "The kids aren\u2019t being gifted anything though, the parents have been given HMDs to sort through. That\u2019s not a gift to the kids.", "Exactly, it\u2019s practically an obligation.  At this point I just say no thank you.  When doing give away I\u2019ll reach out to people that might be able to use what I have but no way am I making a box of my stuff just another thing they have to deal with.", "Plus not every company is okay with you donating those especially if they say staff or something on it.", "36D at 14. Bring it up to her. I was well aware what was happening and wished my mother was more adamant about getting me the garments I needed. I was sexually harassed so badly. It didn\u2019t help my mom just bought me sexy push up bras instead of supportive bras that may not have been as pretty.", "Oh shit, my bad I\u2019m starting to see that I really should have double-checked that before posting it. I wasn\u2019t implying that your mom was crazy, but that it\u2019s an event you still remember being disappointed by. \n\nI read most of OPS's comment, and she honestly sounds a bit \ud83d\ude17 pretentious.  So I meant to imply that her kids are going to look back at their childhood and be like, wtf it was not that serious to be doing all that yk.", "Good point! Both the large nationwide company I work at and my country's main thrift store chains have asked employees not to donate our branded shirts-- our company because they don't want anyone impersonating staff, and the thrift stores because they can't sell them and just throw them out.", "Or even at work. I have jackets and vests and cardigans that i am supposed to wear at work if it is cold enough for me to be wearing extra layers."]}
