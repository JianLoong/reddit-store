If it falls or breaks, she'll get to pick out a new one, and she'll know to pick a reliable, well made one, versus the trendy flash-in-the-pan one.\n\nWe didn't have to worry about tantrums over licensed character bedding (they each have multiple sets of NICE bedding that has never had to be replaced because they \"grew out\" of something).\n\nAt this stage in their lives, we barely have to encourage them.

I also think it\u2019s fine you won\u2019t buy them any of that expensive shit, they\u2019re kids and kids grow, anyway. A lot of it won\u2019t fit long. I never suffered for not getting a new pair of the trendiest shoes or anything besides the cruel bullying that came along with it. Which did happen. A lot.\n\nBut refusing to let them have even *free* stuff is not the same thing, especially as they get older. You\u2019re right. You shouldn\u2019t base your purchases solely off of name brands, but it\u2019s real silly to avoid free things that they like based solely off not wanting your kids to be \u201cseduced by rampant consumerism.\u201d You instilled good morals, no? They don\u2019t feel it\u2019s *necessary* to have these things, so why is it bad to enjoy them occasionally? When I do well at work, sometimes I buy myself something nice, even name brand, as a reward. Not because of the brand specifically, but because I\u2019ve researched that thing, know it will be comfortable and/or will last a long time, and want it. That\u2019s the logic you want to instill. You did good, so you get to sit back and watch them make good decisions. \n\nAlso, because my mom was so insistent that I was allowed to \u201cexpress myself freely,\u201d even when I wasn\u2019t, we aren\u2019t close.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re wrong for your kid not wanting to be a \u201cwalking billboard.\u201d My mom used to say the same kind of stuff and idk if I agree with it, but it did lead me to finding the big logos extremely tacky. I won\u2019t wear them, I also don\u2019t like being a billboard. But that\u2019s for the individual to decide, and you\u2019re going much farther than that by not letting them wear stuff with their favorite media on it. Wearing stuff from a band/tv show/book that you really like **is** a good way to express yourself. Call it rampant consumerism all you want, but the first time I got a My Chemical Romance t-shirt was a moment I\u2019ll forever cherish. I had to jump through ridiculous hoops to find one that fit into my mom\u2019s standards, and it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I deeply cherish having the shirt even today because it was the first time I got to proudly display how much I loved that band!

I think it\u2019s 100% fine to choose your battles and choosing no branding is certainly fine, but let\u2019s not pretend this is a better choice than the battles other parents try to choose.

I think the attitude of ungratefulness and entitlement is strong, here. Maybe it's because you are acting  \"better than the club you belong to\".

There are a bunch of shoes that only have the brand on the soles that you don't see (since Op statet it's okay if the tag is not visible) just brows through a general shoe store, a lot of them will have the brand on the outside. At least in my corner of the world it's how it is.\n\nAlso I was always thought the really good high quality brands don't need to put their name all over the item. A simple small tag is all they need.", "If you've made it clear you want it back if they don't use it then yes this is bad they've given it away. But I doubt this was the deal with the aunt, it sounds like the conversation never happened. Most of the parents I know give away their kids old stuff to parents with younger kids in large bags and never want any of it back. Some of it is hand me downs that have been through many households. The unwritten rule for me is if you don't want anything in there then pass it on to someone who does. OP did keep some of the clothes they thought were appropriate for their own kids and passed on the rest to charity. If the aunt wanted those things to keep why did she give them away? It doesn't make sense it me", "Why do you assume the kids want those branded clothes?", "Exactly. Also getting rid of a shirt that, for example, says levi's on it just to purchase a plain shirt that's also from levi's is crazy", "Oh I thought you meant they don't wear stuff like designer brands, like teens getting snotty over whether it says Gucci or not. I'm all for that.\n\nBut you mean you didn't even let them show what shows and games and stuff they liked as kids? That's just mean. And terrible for self expression.\n\n>We didn't have to worry about tantrums over licensed character bedding (they each have multiple sets of NICE bedding that has never had to be replaced because they \"grew out\" of something).\n\nI still have my pokemon bedding. It's what I liked and it made me happy. Still does.\n\n>They'll turn their noses up at tacky t-shirts with cartoon superheroes on their own.\n\nStill proudly wear pokemon t-shirts too. It's part of who I am. Thank god my parents didn't say I couldn't express my likes and didn't tell me my interests were \"tacky\".", "Hey OP, do you also conflate your children's interests for infectious consumerism? I ask because \"cartoon superheros\" are not necessarily a branding/advertising stint. Kids and ADULTS may very well just enjoy representing their interests visually. Just wondering where you draw your uber-principled line. \n\nAlso, your water bottle example is funky to me. A Stanley is trendy, but it's also a brand-name, uber-expensive bottle for a reason. It's large, durable, and great at insulation. What WOULD be an example of a \"reliable, well-made\" water bottle that you graciously allow your daughter to buy, without a brand name? Or are you just prohibiting brand names you turn your nose up at because they're popular? Because let me tell you, in my experience, any water bottle that I've shopped for that is BPA-free &/ durable has some sort of logo on it, even if I don't recognize the brand.", "Why are you teaching your kids to turn up their noses at other kids choices? Do you think it's healthy to encourage them to look down to their peers for being excited about something \"too consumery\" for you?\n\n\nAre you even reading these anymore? Or did you get the point?", "Do your kids turn up their noses at their friends for being excited for a new superhero shirt? Why teach them that?", "Way to turn your children into elitist snobs. You want to discourage your kids from wasting money on trendy brand names like Versace and Balenciaga? Fine, that\u2019s reasonable, but this is horribly unhealthy to take it to such an extreme.", "You can raise your children to care about the quality of goods instead of brands without being such an AH. I, myself, refused to let my mom buy name brands for me because I was so conscious of the cost. I actually hated wearing my cousins name brand hand me downs because they were literally billboards in the early 2000s but they lasted and were free so I sucked it up. Now I probably spend more money on cheap shit then buying quality items because I still feel weird buying name brands. You are setting your kids up to swing to either end of the spectrum once they get their own money. \n\nAlso turning their noses up at clothing with characters on them sounds like the snootiest, assholiest thing for middle schoolers to do. Let them be kids", "What you're doing is a massive overcorrection. I grew up poor. I learned that sometimes I got what I wanted, most of the time I didn't. You don't have to go in the extreme opposite direction to avoid spoiled kids lol. Eventually they learn that they won't always get what they want if you don't give in to tantrums.", "No. The havent been saved from consumerism, they just knew their mom was a draconian inflexible AH who didnt care about what they wantes.", "Wow OP, condescending much? You don\u2019t want your kids to wear brands. Cool. That\u2019s your choice. It doesn\u2019t make you morally superior to parents who let their kids enjoy things.", "Christ on a cracker, you sound insufferable.", "Wow, YTA and your are a snob. There's a difference between understanding that brands do not equal value, and looking down on all branding period. I do not have name brand water bottles, name brand purses, or purchase name brand food. I never have because I was taught this branding does not equal value. But I like Batman, so I bought a Batman shirt because it reminds me of the thing I like. That's not being a slave to capitalism, and I didn't need to cut out all branding to understand value.", "You're getting a lot of heat but I don't understand it at all. Burning Man, for example, encourages people to wear non-visibly-branded nothing or cover up the labels as part of its effort to be a commercial-free event. People are so steeped in capitalism that they don't even see it anymore. I'm wearing all non-beqnded clothes today except my house Crocs. People are allowed to make choices for themselves and their minor children. I think a lot of the backlash you're getting is defensiveness.", "Snob", "So does that mean you don't own a car? Running shoes? A phone? A computer? Kitchen appliances? A television? All are usually branded.", "Also to be clear you're fighting consumerism by turning down free clothes and buying new clothes instead?", "Stanley has been an industry standard on construction sites for decades, they have buy it for life status.", "Oh my word, you sound insufferable.\n\nI talk to my kids about commercials and media and how companies are trying to get you to buy things. I don\u2019t trash my kids to \u201cturn their nose up\u201d at popular things because I care more about them being kind people than judging those around them for liking something that happens to be liked by others as well.", "Does that mean they look over the stuff and choose not to pick the stuff with logos?", "The best way to not have kids sucked into rampant consumerism is to just teach them how to manage money lol. The only \"clothing\" brands I've ever worn, to my knowledge, were adidas and nike when I was like 6-12 because they were cheap in the early 2000s. My sister, as far as I remember though she's 9 years older, also never chased specific clothing brands etc. \n\nAs for things we LIKED (sister loved nsync and take that in the 90s and I loved pokemon) we got it if we could afford it. If we wanted something we just had to wait and see or get it ourselves. Even now my only \"officially branded\" clothing is Marvel, and thats only t-shirts and they were all gifts or things I bought myself with my money (I have a few other branded tshirts like some Nathan Sharp tshirts, an old nickelback tour tshirt, a youtuber tshirt and a tshirt of a character from a youtube animation - all of which I bought myself but thats like 6 of my like 25 tshirts lol)\n\nI was raised to just get the cheapest option or save for it or get it and lose out on something else for a few weeks. The only tantrum my family ever caved in to for me was when I was like 3 and wanted bugs bunny glasses lol - they did last me years in my own defence lol", "This is just a detail, but the Stanley cup my kid has was passed down from his grandpa. Just because it's popular doesn't mean it isn't a good product.", "Omg you can instil values like this without being ridiculous and giving clothing donated to you to other people. YTA", "Bot", "Stolen comment \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12rz2l3/aita_for_donating_a_bunch_of_handmedowns_my_sil/jgwvp3m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "Exactly why I didn\u2019t side eye it that much.  Rags are the natural next step in the clothing cycle, especially for things like T shirts which can get a lot of hard wear.", "Uhm I'm firmly YAH after reading OP's replies to some of the comments... not even allowing them to wear shirts with their favorite characters etc, making them think they are better than the kids who do? Hella elitist and weird. And apparently SIL did know she donated SOME of it - just not that she donated all of it because they weren't good enough for her kids. OP left a lot out of OG post, but is giving away key details in comments.", "Yeah, Dress shoes usually have the label somewhere not visible if the shoe is being worn.\n\nHigh and low quality brands use logos. Brands that last years and brands that last months. It's more important to teach kids not to buy something just because the brand is cool. I'm sure people get mocked for not having airpods when several other brands are just as good. On the other hand Northface coats are trendy and high quality. Crappy $20 dollar shoes that may be all you can afford but wear out in year have branding logos too.", "Not having a Twinkie is not a bad thing.", "My parents were the same and while I accrued debt, I worked in the fashion industry and was obsessed with fashion houses. I only wear Adidas or Nike sneakers as an obvious brand but I used to be able to spot niche fashion brands by stitching or colour match eyeshadows people were wearing.\n\nI am brand loyal to certain make up brands and have branded brushes that have been my working kit as an MUA for 20 years. Consumerism is bad but understanding branding, quality vs hype is actually a great life skills. It was a huge advantage in my fashion and make up retail careers and now as a writer.\n\nI bought a lot vintage and ran a shop. And I am really really good at selling to people. No one who knows me thinks I am consumerist at all. No jewellery, no car. But I will stalk out a certain chair for *months*. So much of my life revolves around branding yet I have never had too much stuff or any debt or worn logos.\n\nI am tbf terrified of DisneyAdults and baffled by sports fans who buy kit. I am aware they think I\u2019m equally weird to them. I did absolutely hate the sackcloth and ashes attitude of my parents so rebelled. HARD. Ran away to another country fashion school hard.\n\nMy dad did not speak to me for two years. Ragged my ass non stop for a vintage designer bag. That bag is now 20 and has lasted 8 years more than my contact with him\u2026\n\nThis is a bad hill to die on like no sugar parents. (Also mine. I became anorexic but most people just get forbidden fruit syndrome.) Teach critical thinking. And take photos of the most on brand pointless thing they wear to gently mock as they get older and go \u2018WHY THE HELL? WHAT WAS I THINKING?\u2019 when older.\n\nYTA. Also  hope this is stressing you less these days!", "I was thinking about this. I do sports and don\u2019t think I have a single sports garment  that doesn\u2019t  have a visible logo, and tbh my no brand cleats have been significantly lower in quality  in comparison, similar case with running and even casual sneakers. \nI think it\u2019s ok not wanting to wear much logos but this seems extreme. Specially with clothes they\u2019ll grow  out of and didn\u2019t pay for.\n\nEdit: just checked: even my specialty socks (no slip, a bit of compression) have a bit of branding. I wonder what would OP do in case one of the kids wants to do a sport", "I\u2019m really glad my mom just taught me about money and budgeting.  I learned to evaluate quality and how much things cost to make wise choices, but always had the choice and lived with whatever consequences.  If I wanted to \u201cadvertise\u201d she taught me about sales and deals.  I mean, OP\u2019s husband is getting rid of quality things that were free because of a logo?  My family would have used those and put the money saved toward something else.  I confess, I don\u2019t get this ideological thing about avoiding all logos - I\u2019m unclear if it\u2019s really some aversion to advertising or if it\u2019s about not spoiling kids.", "This - I agree with not encouraging consumerism but not allowing shirts with superheroes as if that's tacky sounds snobbish imo. I am 27 and have MOST of my band tees from when I was a teen and went to a ton of festivals and concerts. (One I have from 2008 has holes under both arms but I love it too much to get rid of it, so it's a wear at home while cleaning-shirt atm). Like there is a difference between buying expensive brands that kids will grow out of when they will be perfectly fine with most clothes. But not buying stuff bc they have prints on in general is too much imo.", "Nowhere does she say that they aren't allowed to have \"name brand\" items. What she doesn't allow is for them to wear clothes that have the name brand displayed on the outside. Your entire comment is based on your misunderstanding of her policy. \n\nA band tshirt isn't the same as a logo tee for a big corporation like Coca cola or Gap.", "I actually have plans for a Stanley for when my current insulated water bottle finally needs replacing. That or a Thermos branded one. Depends what I can find on sale and in a girly colour I like lol.", "My favorite sheets have cat faces all over them.  I\u2019m 51.  Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll outgrow them!", "When I was growing up, I had Pokemon bedding that was passed down to my brother when I didn't want it anymore and then it was used as a dropsheet for when we would paint the walls", "She literally said \u201cmedia.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t misunderstand. She\u2019s going on an on and about rampant consumerism, so no, I don\u2019t think this stops at stuff plastered with big logos. \n\nMoreover, even if it does, at this point they are old enough to decide whether or not they like that themselves when it comes to free stuff", "She explicitly said they aren't allowed to have t-shirts or bedding with licensed characters, so it sounds like it goes a lot further than just not wanting the brand name itself on a shirt.", "My favourite is my Aladdin bedding but was part of Primark\u2019s more \u201cgrown up\u201d range and I got the matching circle throw pillow with Jasmine on it. All in the sale. I love sales, most of my major shopping for clothes etc is in the sales, outlet shops, charity shops etc and I currently love FB marketplace for my furniture finds. \u00a330 solid pine double bed to replace my brother and his GF\u2019s current broken bed, yes please lol", "They\u2019re good when slightly stale.
