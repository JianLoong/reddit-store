If it falls or breaks, she'll get to pick out a new one, and she'll know to pick a reliable, well made one, versus the trendy flash-in-the-pan one.\n\nWe didn't have to worry about tantrums over licensed character bedding (they each have multiple sets of NICE bedding that has never had to be replaced because they \"grew out\" of something).\n\nAt this stage in their lives, we barely have to encourage them.

I also think it\u2019s fine you won\u2019t buy them any of that expensive shit, they\u2019re kids and kids grow, anyway. A lot of it won\u2019t fit long. I never suffered for not getting a new pair of the trendiest shoes or anything besides the cruel bullying that came along with it. Which did happen. A lot.\n\nBut refusing to let them have even *free* stuff is not the same thing, especially as they get older. You\u2019re right. You shouldn\u2019t base your purchases solely off of name brands, but it\u2019s real silly to avoid free things that they like based solely off not wanting your kids to be \u201cseduced by rampant consumerism.\u201d You instilled good morals, no? They don\u2019t feel it\u2019s *necessary* to have these things, so why is it bad to enjoy them occasionally? When I do well at work, sometimes I buy myself something nice, even name brand, as a reward. Not because of the brand specifically, but because I\u2019ve researched that thing, know it will be comfortable and/or will last a long time, and want it. That\u2019s the logic you want to instill. You did good, so you get to sit back and watch them make good decisions. \n\nAlso, because my mom was so insistent that I was allowed to \u201cexpress myself freely,\u201d even when I wasn\u2019t, we aren\u2019t close.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re wrong for your kid not wanting to be a \u201cwalking billboard.\u201d My mom used to say the same kind of stuff and idk if I agree with it, but it did lead me to finding the big logos extremely tacky. I won\u2019t wear them, I also don\u2019t like being a billboard. But that\u2019s for the individual to decide, and you\u2019re going much farther than that by not letting them wear stuff with their favorite media on it. Wearing stuff from a band/tv show/book that you really like **is** a good way to express yourself. Call it rampant consumerism all you want, but the first time I got a My Chemical Romance t-shirt was a moment I\u2019ll forever cherish. I had to jump through ridiculous hoops to find one that fit into my mom\u2019s standards, and it wasn\u2019t what I wanted, but I deeply cherish having the shirt even today because it was the first time I got to proudly display how much I loved that band!

I think it\u2019s 100% fine to choose your battles and choosing no branding is certainly fine, but let\u2019s not pretend this is a better choice than the battles other parents try to choose.
