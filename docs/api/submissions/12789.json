I booked a bulkhead aisle seat in economy well in advance because I needed the accommodations it offered.\n\nI have a disability that caused cysts to erode my spinal nerves for years before we caught it, and, despite surgery, I live with severe chronic pain resulting from extensive nerve damage. This pain significantly worsens when I\u2019m sitting in an upright position, but I knew I could manage the flight with my medication, leg room for slouching, and the ability to stand up and move around whenever I needed to ease the pain without having to repeatedly inconvenience potential seat neighbors by forcing them to get up so I could get through.\n\nAnyway, a family of three boarded soon after me, and the mom and baby, probably around 2yo, were in the middle and window seats next to me. The dad was several rows behind in a window seat.\n\nAs I expected, as soon as they were settled in, the mom turned to me and asked me to switch seats with her husband so he could be there to help with the baby. I politely told her \u201cno thank you, I\u2019d like to keep my seat,\u201d which was not received well. She badgered me for several more minutes, but I stood my ground. I even explained to her what I wrote above about my disability and why I needed the seat, and she said \u201cwhat a load of bs.\u201d My condition is invisible, so that really got to me.\n\nI called over a flight attendant because at that point I was tired of being insulted and called heartless (also, the husband never once got involved in this situation) and she eventually got the woman to stop. She still spent the next 8 hours very loudly talking crap about me to the baby and making a show of yelling back to her husband when she needed something, but I put my headphones on, read my book, watched tv, got up and walked around when I needed to, and all around had an otherwise pleasant flight experience.\n\nStill, I did get a lot dirty looks while the mom was making a scene. There was one guy who smiled and nodded at me (he was close enough to hear my story), which I appreciated, but most everyone else around was throwing me disgusted stares for a while. I heard one older lady in the row across whisper to her husband that I was a monster.\n\nI just feel like, if they wanted to sit together, why didn\u2019t they buy 3 tickets next to each other in the first place? Perhaps I would\u2019ve considered switching if it were only a minor inconvenience\u2014I understand traveling with a baby must be hard\u2014but in this case, switching would\u2019ve negatively impacted my flight experience to a very high degree, and that isn\u2019t what I paid extra for when I purchased my ticket months in advance.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was the AH, but it\u2019s hard to maintain that thought when you have a cabin of people looking at you like you kicked a lost puppy.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to switch?\n\nEdit: To the people who commented about it - true, I know I shouldn\u2019t care what the others on the plane thought of me, and usually I don\u2019t care about that stuff, it\u2019s just that this was only my second time flying alone and I have pretty bad social anxiety and it was just an all around really uncomfortable situation.

Did she offer to switch sests with the people sitting in the row with the dad? Didn't think so.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent and I\u2019ve flown with a baby more than once. While I don\u2019t have an issue with a parent politely asking for a seat switch, it is absolutely your call whether you want to move or not, even if you didn\u2019t have chronic pain to deal with. There was no excuse for her to badger you, argue with you after you\u2019d said no, or be rude to you afterwards.", "NTA - as a mom of 3 small kids I\u2019m telling you that you are not the AH, she is. You\u2019re right if they wanted to sit together then they should have planned for it. She\u2019s the AH for treating you like that.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nShe's not an AH for asking, but she's a total, complete and utter AH for not shutting up when you said no. \n\nThat's a LONG flight, man! She didn't even deserve an explanation, but you gave her the reason and she still didn't shut up.\n\nYou did everything right, my friend. She sucks and I feel sorry for that baby.", "NTA. You reserved the seat in advance and paid for the extra leg room. She\u2019s the Asshole for everything she did from being entitled to thinking someone should give up her seat for her right to her mutterings. \n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself. \n\nDon\u2019t ever let anyone guilt you into giving up your seat.", "NTA in the slightest. If they wanted seats together they should have booked them like that. They didn't. That sounds like a whole lot of Their Problem.", "NTA at all. I travelled to Hawaii (10 hours over 2 flights) with my two kids last year and when I booked the tickets, I paid extra for seats together. That's what you do when you want to sit together. Either they couldn't afford to or didn't want to but either way, their poor planning is not your issue.", "NTA.\n\nYou chose your seat and are entitled to it.  She asked and you declined as is your right.  They should have booked 3 seats together if it was such a problem.  And if there weren't 3 seats together when they booked, they should have known that it was a possibility that somebody wouldn't switch seats.", "NTA. If a family need three seats together they should book in advance the same way you did", "NTA, good on you for standing your ground. Having an inconvinient seating arrangement is no excuse to shit talk someones disability.", "Was he in a cheaper seat? Maybe they do this often, so save money.", "NTA. Your disability is more important than their comfort.", "NTA. It's no more reasonable to expect you to move than it is to expect the people sitting next to her husband to swap with her and the baby, or some other row to do the same.\n\nIf you're ever in a similar situation you might be able to diffuse it by saying something like \"I'm happy to help but I have X needs for the seat I move to. If you can work with the flight attendants to take care of that I'd love to help you out\". Probably won't stop the drama but might make it clearer to everybody you're not being unreasonable.", "NTA, but I would have made it quite loud that she was asking a disabled individual move. Make her feel quite uncomfortable.", "Nta if they wanted to sit together they could have offered the better seats to the people in her row. The fact that they didn't means they didn't just want to sit together, they wanted to sit together in better seats that they paid half for.", "NTA.  Why didn't she and the baby trade seats with the people in her husband's row?  Wait, i get it, her priority was her seats, not sitting with her husband.", "NTA.\n\nHaving a kid is not an excuse to act like one.", "NTA and screw that lady, you should have started filming her as soon as she did it and then notified the attendants each time she was harassing you, in the hope of getting her denied from the airline going forward.  \n\nOr if they didn't help, perhaps try teaching the baby curse words - fuck fuck fuck fuckity fuck!  Can you call mommy a fucking fuck?  An ableist, selfish, rude fucking fuck?  [Singing voice] The hills are alive, with the sound of fuuuuuuuck!", "NTA. Your seat is your seat. If they are able to book 2 bulkhead seats, they could have booked 3 together further back in the plane, they just didn't want to sit further back.", "Nta - traveling is rarely a last minute decision and they should have paid for seats together or checked in with the airline upon arrival to see if they could fix the situation. They could have also asked the people in the husbands row if they\u2019d be willing to trade. \n\nAs for everyone else in the plane - what other people think of you is none of your business. Meaning pay no mind to it", "NTA. If they wanted to be together then they should\u2019ve asked the people beside the husband after you refused the first time. \u201cNo\u201d is a full sentence", "NTA. Sounds like mom and dad should have figured out their crap or took turns with the baby.", "NTA. Minor inconvenience vs chronic pain. If it helps the dad was probably glad for the break from the mom. So you did that poor man a service for the 8 hours you tolerated her BS. And for that you deserve a salute. Bet he would shake your hand.", "The answer is always the same: the two people in with the husband can move up to the better seats and they can sit together. Funny they never want to move to the worse seats to be together. \n\nNTA.", ">when you have a cabin of people looking at you like you kicked a lost puppy.\n\nNTA, but come on. Not that many people notice or care about what's going on when it doesn't concern them directly.", "I've traveled alone with a baby before, the hard part is boarding and deboarding not necessarily the flight itself. Plenty of people do this all the time. Also, like you said, they could have gotten their seats together. Nta", "NTA", "NTA, $50 bucks that the dad did not want to sit with mum and babe.", "In this well constructed fantasy, you are of course NTA.", "NTA, we went on a couples trip, four couples booked window and middle in four econ rows so we\u2019re together", "NTA. You booked the seat that you needed and they could have done the same (unless they had to fly last minute). I am very claustrophobic and I have to be in an aisle seat or I will have a panic attack. \n\nThey only way I would have switched in your position would have been if the dad had an aisle seat as well. \n\nThe dad also could have asked the others in his row to switch so the wife and baby could sit back with him .", "NTA with or without the disability. 8 hours is a long flight.
