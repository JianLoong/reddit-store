I booked a bulkhead aisle seat in economy well in advance because I needed the accommodations it offered.\n\nI have a disability that caused cysts to erode my spinal nerves for years before we caught it, and, despite surgery, I live with severe chronic pain resulting from extensive nerve damage. This pain significantly worsens when I\u2019m sitting in an upright position, but I knew I could manage the flight with my medication, leg room for slouching, and the ability to stand up and move around whenever I needed to ease the pain without having to repeatedly inconvenience potential seat neighbors by forcing them to get up so I could get through.\n\nAnyway, a family of three boarded soon after me, and the mom and baby, probably around 2yo, were in the middle and window seats next to me. The dad was several rows behind in a window seat.\n\nAs I expected, as soon as they were settled in, the mom turned to me and asked me to switch seats with her husband so he could be there to help with the baby. I politely told her \u201cno thank you, I\u2019d like to keep my seat,\u201d which was not received well. She badgered me for several more minutes, but I stood my ground. I even explained to her what I wrote above about my disability and why I needed the seat, and she said \u201cwhat a load of bs.\u201d My condition is invisible, so that really got to me.\n\nI called over a flight attendant because at that point I was tired of being insulted and called heartless (also, the husband never once got involved in this situation) and she eventually got the woman to stop. She still spent the next 8 hours very loudly talking crap about me to the baby and making a show of yelling back to her husband when she needed something, but I put my headphones on, read my book, watched tv, got up and walked around when I needed to, and all around had an otherwise pleasant flight experience.\n\nStill, I did get a lot dirty looks while the mom was making a scene. There was one guy who smiled and nodded at me (he was close enough to hear my story), which I appreciated, but most everyone else around was throwing me disgusted stares for a while. I heard one older lady in the row across whisper to her husband that I was a monster.\n\nI just feel like, if they wanted to sit together, why didn\u2019t they buy 3 tickets next to each other in the first place? Perhaps I would\u2019ve considered switching if it were only a minor inconvenience\u2014I understand traveling with a baby must be hard\u2014but in this case, switching would\u2019ve negatively impacted my flight experience to a very high degree, and that isn\u2019t what I paid extra for when I purchased my ticket months in advance.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was the AH, but it\u2019s hard to maintain that thought when you have a cabin of people looking at you like you kicked a lost puppy.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to switch?\n\nEdit: To the people who commented about it - true, I know I shouldn\u2019t care what the others on the plane thought of me, and usually I don\u2019t care about that stuff, it\u2019s just that this was only my second time flying alone and I have pretty bad social anxiety and it was just an all around really uncomfortable situation.

You booked what you needed to have a comfortable trip. The family did not. And the mother had absolutely no right to be mad at you for not switching seats.

With the international airlines I fly with, you cannot book the bulkhead seats in advanced and they are issued on a first come first served basis to parents traveling with infants.

Who's going to look out for your health besides you.\n\nBut, as for why they didn't book three seats together, they probably would have booked those 3 seats but one was already occupied.

Your ability to reproduce, like more than half the human adult polulation has done, does not entitle you to upgrades.\n\nNTA OP.", "Benefit of the doubt. They probably tried to book all 3 bulkhead seats but OP had booked first so only 2 were available. Highly desired seats like the bulkhead and exit rows go first. So their next plan was book the 2 open seats and a window in another row hoping someone would switch bulkhead window for cramped window. Their plan just didn't work.\n\nI used to have horrible claustrophobic issues on planes so I'd book (and pay a lot for) the first class bulkhead for maximum room. I once got on a flight to find a disabled woman and her caretaker had pre-boarded and helped themselves to my seat. I felt like an absolute AH when I insisted they move to their assigned seats. The flight attendants wanted no part in that one. This was a situation that absolutely should have been handled by the gate agents prior to letting anyone on the plane. If this woman knew her legs didn't bend and she needed a special seat but didn't book it, they should have talked to all of the people with bulkhead seats before boarding and made adjustments instead of just doing the whole \"just take the seat and hope the actual ticket holder isn't a heartless monster.\"", "Which baby was he trying to avoid?

I am a 30f (i look young for my age too) and have an invisible chronic illness so I know how much you have to fight to have your condition and pain to be taken seriously. It's honestly prob cos of your age.  People believe if your not blind, in a wheel chair or look like your on the verge of death,  that your condition is not \"real\". That all young ppl are in peak health. That paired with the fact that ppl think having a child should make you a priority in any and all situations is so frustrating.

I would have had a hard time staying quiet with the woman who whispered to her husband.\n\nYou are not only NTA,  I realize I would be a \u201cI Love Big Butts\u201d AH.  I better start stocking up on my Apple bottom jeans", "NTA. Disability or not, you paid extra to have that seat. They could have asked to switch with the people in the father\u2019s row, but didn\u2019t. The fact that the husband didn\u2019t get involved leads me to think he probably welcomed the break. \n\nOP, I also want to add that having invisible disabilities doesn\u2019t make your disabilities any less real. Sadly, people judge what they don\u2019t understand and fail to believe what they can\u2019t see. Keep standing up for yourself and your health! I promise, it does get easier!

Sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA. It would have been fine to refuse to move even without a reason. Bulkhead seats are a significant improvement on the other seats. You booked a bulkhead seat. There is no reason for you to give it up.", "NTA. They should have paid to pre-book seats. I always do that when travelling with someone else, after being separated from my travelling partner once for an 8 hour flight.", "Even if you did not have this disability, you PAID for that seat. She has no right to that seat from the start and she is a major AH for making a scene about it, especially disregarding your disability. NTA, seriously.", "Ive only flown a few times but never ever experienced these kinds of flyers. Where do these people come from? Also nta.", "You are no AH, that title belongs to the mother who after you explained why you couldn't swap called your reason BS and went on the whole flight about you not swapping, even after the flight attendant told her to stop. If they wanted seats together they should have booked and I'd say the reason the husband said nothing was because he got some peace for not having  to sit next to his wife for 8 hours.", "NTA. I've managed flights with my baby alone - completely alone, no husband there to help with boarding. We were absolutely fine.\n\nI also have chronic pain and the things I would like to say to the entitled AH mother would get me a ban from the mods. I have zero patience for abilism", "NTA - Its a long flight and you planned ahead.  I was lucky recently on both of my flights that were 8 hours.  As I travelled solo I had the seat next to me vacant, which made life easier.\n\nThe idea that everybody must make way for people with babies is crazy.  She was the person who brought a baby on an 8 hour flight and she had already made other people's flight painful enough. \n\nShe could have switched seats with her husband half way through the flight to let him take over .", "So true.  If this ever happens to me, I think I\u2019d politely suggest that she does this.", "That\u2019s exit rows.  Bulkhead seats sometimes have a bassinet, especially on long haul flights, but they\u2019re meant for infants.", "even if OP had no disability, why should the story be different? she picked & paid for bulkhead, why should there be any expectation to give it up just because these people didn't plan accordingly?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I remember giving up seats or offering to carry the diaper bag of struggling moms trying to do normal everyday tasks made much harder toting a child around. Now being a parent, I definitely don't regret those times I helped. I'm finding that I'm now on the receiving end of people who help me at random. There are a lot of generous and kind-hearted people who are willing to lend a hand to make things a little easier for me. I don't think my having children entitles me to this help though. I think some parents grow used to people helping them and it grows into this ugly feeling of entitlement. I find these parents are fewer than decent ones though. The unpleasant ones are just louder and harder to forget like the ones OP encountered. Just wanted to say... despite many stories of entitled parents...not all parents feel entitled. Most of them don't.", "He was the winner.  Didn\u2019t have to sit next to his loudmouth/opinionated wife.  No wonder those next to him were not asked", "And don\u2019t explain. NO is a complete answer", "If this situation ever arises again and you are getting bullied by someone (even if they are talking shit about you to their baby with the intent of you hearing it) call the flight attendant and tell them. You don\u2019t have to endure that for any length of time much less an 8 hour flight.", "She was absolutely 100% wrong to take it out on OP but I am fed up with people acting like poor dad trying to get away from horrible mum when she was mostly likely only angry about the seat because he took the one with no childcare duties. I bet if HE'D been the one stuck solo parenting she would have been nice and quiet...", "And OP should have mentioned she had a disability to the FA. I bet the FA would've stopped the harassment - by kicking the mom off the plane.", "As someone who also has an invisible chronic pain condition you're NTA\n\nLack of planning on her part doesn't constitute an emergency on your part.\n\nAlso getting pretty sick and tired of parents expecting everyone to accommodate them. Everyone knows children are exhausting and work and if they choose to have kids they shouldn't be pissed off when others who weren't involved don't feel like accommodating their life choices", "Thank you for the explanation of why you didn\u2019t switch seats, interesting but not necessary.  You bought your seat period, end of conversation.  Having a little one doesn\u2019t trump everything else.  Too often people buy seats thinking that others will switch with them because they won\u2019t want to sit next to a child.  Heck, give me my Bose QC earbuds and I won\u2019t even know you are there which is what I like and you are NTA, I wouldn\u2019t switch either.", "NTA. You have a legitimate disability. \n\nI have disabilities too and I\u2019m tired, so tired of trying to tell people why accommodations for my disability aren\u2019t a privilege that I need to give up (one time, I was waiting in a pharmacy literal minutes after being released from having major surgery that included a liver resection, and one woman gave me serious shit for not giving up my seat to her. One time, a man on a bus who didn\u2019t think I needed a disabled seat, told me \u201cYou must been **mentally** disabled. You are **mentally** disabled.\u201d).\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have had to explain your medical history to this woman, but I realize she was badgering you relentlessly. \n\nHonestly, I would contact the airline because they need to know how disabled people are being treated by other passengers, and they need to be able to see if there\u2019s anything more that they can do to assist their disabled passengers with support. (Maybe they could give like a little disabled placard or something on the seat that says reserved for passenger with a disability.) \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened, that woman is a word I can\u2019t really say online. \n\nShe wanted a convenience, but you needed an accommodation for your painful disability. She can eff off into the sun.", "Note she did not trade seats with the people sat with her husband who would have been - I guess - happy with the trade.\n\nYour disability is actually irrelevant to the debate. You were in the assigned seat you paid for. She had no right to badger you. Her lack of planning and lack of class was not your emergency. NTA.", "NTA.  You paid for the seat you needed.  They should have paid for the seats they wanted rather than hoping to weasel their way into better seats.", "NTA at all and I'm sure this will be unanimous. And don't forget, there were a plane full of other people who could have offered to swap if they felt so strongly!!  And here I'm talking in particular about the older people across the aisle!!", "At no point should anyone ever feel like they should ever feel like they should have to switch seats. That said I now kind of want to fly and our family be broken up amongst different seats so I can make someone sit next to my don.

Some people are so idiotic with their childish belief that if they can't see it, it isn't real.", "I have traveled with children from infant to preschooler a number of times, usually without my husband. I\u2019ve never deliberately reserved bulkhead seats because of that (I want under the seat carry-ons, for one reason) and would not have expected someone to switch with me if my husband was in another row. If anything, I would have just switched off mid-flight with him, and had him come forward while I went back.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. If I decided not to ignore her comments, I would have repeated ad nauseam, \u201cyou could have switched with the people next to them, I paid more for this seat due to my disability\u201d If she admitted she was not willing to give up her seating for whatever reason, then she\u2019d have to stop complaining, right? \ud83d\ude00 No, but at least she would have to state her hypocrisy aloud.", "It seems like there has been a slew of these posts lately.

My physical disability is invisible so I tend to land in the \u2018I can\u2019t see it you must be lying to get perks\u2019 camp from every angle. \n\nThis taught me two things: some people consider getting to be embroiled in drama a perk and those people are not my people. And second, I don\u2019t over explain my disability. I clearly state the \u2018so what\u2019 outcome of not having this access need. \u2018If I move from this seat I will have a medical event that may cause the plane to re-route. If I stand on this bus I will vomit and the bus will be delayed.\u2019 Leave inference hanging of \u2018your choice\u2026\u2019\n\nIf they keep going I simply sigh and say I will drop my lawyer an email as part of the procedure under the Equality Act re disability discrimination. There isn\u2019t necessarily one if a customer is nagging me but the business is upholding my needs as a protected class but most able bodied people don\u2019t know that. I smile as I say it like it\u2019s chit chat. But my tone says try me and that drama. You will not enjoy it so much\u2026\n\nAnd then if they keep going I either say \u2018would you like me to add harassment to that email?\u2019 and then stop engaging but take out a notebook or open my phone notes each time they pipe up again. If I have taken the time and expense to plan ahead then I\u2019m not open to debate. Nor am I debating my medical history.\n\nI will ask the flight attendant to intervene and remind them of the legislation \u2018just to save them the hassle as looks like that seat are going to cause you stress all flight and I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019d prefer to avoid that. Thank you so much for sorting it so I remain here in my pre-booked paid for seat. I really appreciate it.\u2019 Big smile. FA finds it hard to ask you to just agree to make life easy when you\u2019ve thanked them by saying \u2018I will not be shifting and I will leave a paper trail. Pick: yappy customer or paperwork for days\u2026\u2019\n\nI do often ask for the staff member\u2019s name so I can thank the airline if they do well and say that. \u2018Can I ask your name so X is aware how helpful you\u2019ve been? It really makes me want to fly with your airline.\u2019 I will also do it when the FA has not been super helpful and knows it but is then in a bind.\n\nI have to spend a huge amount of time planning and paying extra to leave the house. I also have to spend a vast amount of time applying for the benefits that help cover some of these costs or passport you to access help. The fact I can almost never book online but have to call up or that to get the rail access for example I have to be in receipt of a benefit that was a 68 page form, in person assessment, 100 page appeal, 18 month waiting time and then a tribunal in front of a judge gives me zero, literally zero fucks to give that someone wants a shortcut for free.\n\nI\u2019m tired. I used to be more people pleasing and people can get bent. Organise yourself. My disability is a second full time job and I am not being your PA for free. And I give no shits anymore if those people upon hearing a disabled person says no don\u2019t like you because it pretty much proves they had no respect for disabled people to begin with but wanted an excuse to hang their asshole hat on.\n\nI notice they almost never ask men who may be invisibly disabled too the same, people they assume are older than them but not elderly, those with certain class signifiers or parents. They ask me who is female, looks young and clearly isn\u2019t wealthy. They ask POC. I point out that they could ask that other person in the other seat who isn\u2019t me or the FA and then sometimes just say \u2018noted\u2019 if they say they can\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t travel very much on planes but dear god the non stop bullshit on buses, tube, trains, even taxis is exhausting. I used to worry how I came across then I realised I don\u2019t want to be liked by someone who is an asshole\u2026\n\nI also spend the entire time panicking, spirally inside and refusing to show it because bullies love a reaction. It is miserable. Let me sit and read my book. I don\u2019t complain about babies on flights because I get that carries its own invisible baggage akin to mine. We have more in common but they want to fight to be separate but equal. Not today Satan.", "They should have booked 3 seats together if it was such a problem."]}
