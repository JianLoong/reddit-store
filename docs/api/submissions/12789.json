I booked a bulkhead aisle seat in economy well in advance because I needed the accommodations it offered.\n\nI have a disability that caused cysts to erode my spinal nerves for years before we caught it, and, despite surgery, I live with severe chronic pain resulting from extensive nerve damage. This pain significantly worsens when I\u2019m sitting in an upright position, but I knew I could manage the flight with my medication, leg room for slouching, and the ability to stand up and move around whenever I needed to ease the pain without having to repeatedly inconvenience potential seat neighbors by forcing them to get up so I could get through.\n\nAnyway, a family of three boarded soon after me, and the mom and baby, probably around 2yo, were in the middle and window seats next to me. The dad was several rows behind in a window seat.\n\nAs I expected, as soon as they were settled in, the mom turned to me and asked me to switch seats with her husband so he could be there to help with the baby. I politely told her \u201cno thank you, I\u2019d like to keep my seat,\u201d which was not received well. She badgered me for several more minutes, but I stood my ground. I even explained to her what I wrote above about my disability and why I needed the seat, and she said \u201cwhat a load of bs.\u201d My condition is invisible, so that really got to me.\n\nI called over a flight attendant because at that point I was tired of being insulted and called heartless (also, the husband never once got involved in this situation) and she eventually got the woman to stop. She still spent the next 8 hours very loudly talking crap about me to the baby and making a show of yelling back to her husband when she needed something, but I put my headphones on, read my book, watched tv, got up and walked around when I needed to, and all around had an otherwise pleasant flight experience.\n\nStill, I did get a lot dirty looks while the mom was making a scene. There was one guy who smiled and nodded at me (he was close enough to hear my story), which I appreciated, but most everyone else around was throwing me disgusted stares for a while. I heard one older lady in the row across whisper to her husband that I was a monster.\n\nI just feel like, if they wanted to sit together, why didn\u2019t they buy 3 tickets next to each other in the first place? Perhaps I would\u2019ve considered switching if it were only a minor inconvenience\u2014I understand traveling with a baby must be hard\u2014but in this case, switching would\u2019ve negatively impacted my flight experience to a very high degree, and that isn\u2019t what I paid extra for when I purchased my ticket months in advance.\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was the AH, but it\u2019s hard to maintain that thought when you have a cabin of people looking at you like you kicked a lost puppy.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to switch?\n\nEdit: To the people who commented about it - true, I know I shouldn\u2019t care what the others on the plane thought of me, and usually I don\u2019t care about that stuff, it\u2019s just that this was only my second time flying alone and I have pretty bad social anxiety and it was just an all around really uncomfortable situation.

Your disability is more important than their comfort.", "NTA. It's no more reasonable to expect you to move than it is to expect the people sitting next to her husband to swap with her and the baby, or some other row to do the same.\n\nIf you're ever in a similar situation you might be able to diffuse it by saying something like \"I'm happy to help but I have X needs for the seat I move to. If you can work with the flight attendants to take care of that I'd love to help you out\". Probably won't stop the drama but might make it clearer to everybody you're not being unreasonable.", "NTA, but I would have made it quite loud that she was asking a disabled individual move.

Wait, i get it, her priority was her seats, not sitting with her husband.", "NTA.\n\nHaving a kid is not an excuse to act like one.", "NTA and screw that lady, you should have started filming her as soon as she did it and then notified the attendants each time she was harassing you, in the hope of getting her denied from the airline going forward.  \n\nOr if they didn't help, perhaps try teaching the baby curse words - fuck fuck fuck fuckity fuck!

They could have easily offered to switch with the people sitting next to dad and they might have enjoyed the extra legroom and earlier deplaning. But she didn't really need her whole family together, she wanted them together in the BETTER seating.", "I was wondering that too.

You booked what you needed to have a comfortable trip. The family did not. And the mother had absolutely no right to be mad at you for not switching seats. Airlines need to buckle down on bullying by people flying on their planes that feel they have the right to expect someone to make up for their own inadequacies when purchasing their tickets. Bullying should not be tolerated. Flight attendants should have the power to shut that crap down and be able to ban the passengers that are doing the bullying from ever flying with their airline again.", "NTA\u2014for reference, my son and I had exit row seats last weekend, but in different sides of the aisle.

And you might even be a hero to that husband.", "If they wanted to sot together then they should have gotten seats reserved together.   That what you should have said loudly at her.\n\nNTA.", "NTA Why do people not book seats together if they are traveling together. Why do they think it's right to expect someone to give up their seats?", "NTA To hell with everyone else. You know that you have an invisible disability. You don't owe them explanations.", "NTA. You made the necessary arrangements to make travel as comfortable as possible for your disability. If you were fully able I'm sure the story would have been different.\n\nAs soon as she called bullshit on your disability is right where I would have ended the conversation with her as well. I have an invisible disability too and hate the kind of people that think you have to be like Stephen Hawking to qualify as disabled.\n\nShe was the asshole and I'm guessing her husband didn't get involved because he knows it.", "NTA. What is it with people not buying their plane seats together and then badgering one single person?! It\u2019s annoying enough that they don\u2019t make their plans the way they want to begin with, but they don\u2019t even try anyone else, they just make that one person\u2019s life miserable for hours! Wtf?!", "NTA.\n\nAnd did the other people who gave you dirty looks offer their seats? Didn't think so.", "So I travel a lot, including internationally. With the international airlines I fly with, you cannot book the bulkhead seats in advanced and they are issued on a first come first served basis to parents traveling with infants. So it\u2019s very possible the parents did book 3 seats together and then got switched to the bulkhead and were told only 2 could be accommodated and the person at check in told them it would be easy to switch - I\u2019ve been in that exact situation. Given the physical issues you described I think NTA and clearly the mother behaved inappropriately, I just shared my experience to address your question regarding why not book seats together.", "NTA.  Also, don't bother explaining your disability to people who are asking you to do something you don't want to do.  Just say no.  You aren't obligated to give them a reason.  It's none of their damn business why you reserved that seat.\n\nFor the record, I'm a mom and it's not the end of the world if the family doesn't sit together on a flight.", "Entitled parents are the worst. You\u2019re literally disabled. Her husband clearly wasn\u2019t bothered with sitting with them. NTA.", "NTA  \nNext say, \"You should have booked your seats together if you wanted to sit together. I paid extra for this seat. I'm not switching.\"", "NTA, what a nasty person!", "NTA. Why didn't they ask the others in the husband's row to switch?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA: she should\u2019ve walked baby to dad halfway through the flight & then put her own headphones in for 4 hours.", "NTA- and I would have complained about the continued harassment from the other passenger. You could have suggested that she and her daughter offer their bulkhead row seats to the other 2 people in her husband's row.", "NTA. It's not that you didn't do anything wrong but you did the right thing. Who's going to look out for your health besides you.\n\nBut, as for why they didn't book three seats together, they probably would have booked those 3 seats but one was already occupied. Parents with babies often choose the bulkhead seats because of the extra floor space and the baby buckets for the infants to sleep.", "This was my first thought. They could probably have sat together if they offered the 2 seats with more legroom to the 2 people in dad's row instead of trying to keep the legroom for themselves by ousting OP.\n\nFar too many people try to get upgrades with their cries of \"but I have chiiiiildren\".  Your ability to reproduce, like more than half the human adult polulation has done, does not entitle you to upgrades.\n\nNTA OP.", "Benefit of the doubt. They probably tried to book all 3 bulkhead seats but OP had booked first so only 2 were available. Highly desired seats like the bulkhead and exit rows go first. So their next plan was book the 2 open seats and a window in another row hoping someone would switch bulkhead window for cramped window. Their plan just didn't work.\n\nI used to have horrible claustrophobic issues on planes so I'd book (and pay a lot for) the first class bulkhead for maximum room. I once got on a flight to find a disabled woman and her caretaker had pre-boarded and helped themselves to my seat. I felt like an absolute AH when I insisted they move to their assigned seats. The flight attendants wanted no part in that one. This was a situation that absolutely should have been handled by the gate agents prior to letting anyone on the plane. If this woman knew her legs didn't bend and she needed a special seat but didn't book it, they should have talked to all of the people with bulkhead seats before boarding and made adjustments instead of just doing the whole \"just take the seat and hope the actual ticket holder isn't a heartless monster.\"", "Which baby was he trying to avoid?  The wife/mom wasn't exactly acting like a grown-up, was she?", "Yeah, I'm sure hardly anyone noticed or cared, and if they did, they forgot 2 seconds after deplaning.", "Oh that\u2019s awful! Can I ask, what ended up happening? Did they move?"]}
