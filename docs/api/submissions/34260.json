My auntie (Mary) (late 20's) moved abroad with her husband but was very close to my parents (her father died when she was young so they took her in and she grew up with us like she was my sister and they paid her school fees, housed her, etc), so she organized a surprise delivery for them. \n\nShe told me that she was sending something and asked for a cake flavour, so I rightfully assumed that she was sending a cake and perhaps a bouquet. Mary then gave me the number of the lady (Lucy) handling the delivery (in our country of residence). I told Mary that I wasn't going to be home at the time, cause i was braiding my hair but my sisters were home, then Lucy called me she told me there was a \"saxophone guy\" too. I assumed it was one guy playing a saxophone to accompany so I let it be since our day was very hectic and my parents were very tired. \n\nWhen I directed him to my place I told my mum to step out for something but she said that, first; my dad wasn't home and second; she was very tired and didn't want to attend to anyone. I then told my sister to tell him to only give her the cake, then I called the guy, knowing I was gonna let him down, to give the bad news and offer compensation. To my surprise, it wasnt one guy but a whole band! with multiple instruments. I wasn't aware of that detail but laid it to them anyways. \n\nLucy then called me saying that I disorganized everything and they had been paid by Mary and everything. I explained how I was unaware and that i wasnt home but she got very upset with me and said that it was my fault for not effectively communicating before hand that one of my parents wasnt home and that my mum wasnt expecting anyone.\n\nI apologized and offered compensation but she did not want it saying that it's the surprise that's the price or something. I accepted but I want to really know whether I was actually in the wrong and if I should perhaps just send compensation anyways because I live in a place with awful roads and I couldn't imagine sending back a group of people with bulky instruments on a motorcycle.

The people involved in the surprise didn\u2019t effectively communicate to you what it was, didn\u2019t make it at a time when everyone needed (you, Mom, Dad) was available, and didn\u2019t coordinate with anyone who was more available than you even when you told them to talk to your sisters. None of this is on you.\n\nYour aunt had a nice idea (provided this is something your parents would enjoy), but it was a complicated thing to try to achieve even if she\u2019d been living in the same house as you guys, Mary dropped the ball on communicating with someone who would be home, and her proxy Lucy dropped the ball on getting everything lined up. If you\u2019re going to try to organize this sort of thing you need to roll with the punches - sometimes people have to work late, or get sick, or make their own plans since they don\u2019t know about the surprise.", "NTA. The risk of planning a surprise that requires people to be in a specific place at a specific time is that it's all going to fall apart and that only becomes more likely when there the planning doesn't have everyone involved specifically looped in. Their poor planning is not your fault in the least and anyone trying to blame you for it is just wrong.", "NTA - sounds like an understandable messy situation. You did what you thought was right... can the surprise just be rescheduled? Like you can plan it together for a time when you know they'll both be home and when they're likely to be in a good mood? Perhaps before a night out or something like that?", "Mary: I have a great idea! But, it\u2019s going to be poorly executed. \n\nYou: Mary, dad\u2019s not home, mom is tired, and it\u2019s chaotic here. \n\nMary: Waaaahhhh! It\u2019s all your fault!
