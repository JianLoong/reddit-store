We got along really great and continued to do so at occasional family gatherings leading up to the wedding. We never really hung out outside of these family events until this summer when I came back from college and had time to stop in when he invited me at night.\r  \n\r  \nLast week, his wife, my sister, his sister, and their mom (my sister's MIL) were all on a girls trip for a long weekend, so I was invited to come stay for a night while they were gone. It was the night of July third. Me and Tom were sitting on his patio, sharing a blunt and watching the fireworks that some of the neighbors were shooting.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I wouldn't necessarily say there's been controversy among me and his family, but his wife has never seemed interested in engaging in conversation with me even before anything happened. Then a few months ago around his birthday, my sister called me to confirm that a certain birthday gift of his (a nice sweater and a bottle of cologne) was truly from me. Apparently his wife had found it and didn't believe him when he said I was who gifted it to him. So while I wouldn't say there's bad blood, my sister did tell me to back off. I obviously didn't, because I didn't see the harm.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, there was some mix up with their Airbnb or hotel, I'm not sure of specifics, and they ended up returning home the night of the third instead of the next day as they had planned. They saw me and Tom on the back patio and, for lack of a less cringe way to describe this, chaos ensued. The wife basically grabbed the blunt out of my hands and told me to get out. Then my sister's older, very conservative and Christian mother in law came out, saw we were smoking, and freaked out. She claimed she was having a heart attack and demanded to be taken to the hospital.\r  \n\r  \nI left. Turns out the older lady was just having a panic attack over seeing her adult son smoke weed with a younger man. Oh, the scandal. My sister called me and told me that 1. I made her look back in front of her in-laws and 2. I was expected to help cover any medical expenses because I \"caused\" this situation.

Is there some reason his wife doesn't like you and he hanging around one another, other than the significant age gap(he was 18 when you were born, that IS slightly sus).\n\nThe way you've told the story makes these people seem nuts, but I'm pretty sure you're leaving out crucial context.", "Cover medical expenses?

The fact you're giving him gifts and acknowledge you won't back off despite specifically being asked isn't helping\n\nAll of this is entirely her problem to deal with. I'm totally willing to acknowledge that it's possible there's missing info that might indicate more to their relationship (or maybe SIL knows more regarding Tom's pov), but so far OP has listed nothing in his behavior that leans that way. Hanging out together and getting gifts for in laws who you've made friends with is completely platonic. It's not on OP to back away from a platonic relationship just bc someone else is upset with it. It's Tom's wife, so Tom needs to make that decision for himself. As long as OP isn't crossing any romantic boundaries, he's not doing anything wrong.", "Who cares what BIL's wife thinks here? She doesn't get to say who her husband's friends are, any more than he decides hers. Express an opinion, of course, decide for him, no. If BIL tells OP not to come around anymore, then probably he won't. But BIL obviously considers him a friend. Sister shouldn't be involved in this at all. It's none of her damn business. OP has done absolutely nothing that you wouldn't expect of a friend.", "It was Tom and his wife's house, I brought the weed upon request.\n\nNo missing context, really.

This year, we were hearing fireworks occasionally starting about a week before. Only heard a few in the couple of days after. Usually takes a little longer to peter out. But I think the closest neighbors in the area didn't let off as many day of as in recent years either.\n\nIts normal.", "OP is 20. BIL is 38.

And he's now all better and married and everything is just the way everyone wanted. \n\nCuz yeah, a 20 yr old and a 38 yr old being friends is a little odd.
