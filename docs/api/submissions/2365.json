He does feel bad about it and has apologized but it was very hurtful at the time. \nThis is something she will remember forever because it is hurtful and shows that you don't care and think it isn't important.

The shipping for US products, even from an EU American store, is really high so the cost per lemonade is less when you buy more.\n\nAlso you are being controlling.
