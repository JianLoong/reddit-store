Communication is key.\n\n* You imposed conditions where there were none before (\"it's high in sugar and is expensive\"). Did you have a conversation where you agreed on this, or were you just unilaterally making a decision about what was suddenly not okay?\n\n* To be pregnant, especially in the later trimesters, is to be in a state of constant discomfort.

He does feel bad about it and has apologized but it was very hurtful at the time. \nThis is something she will remember forever because it is hurtful and shows that you don't care and think it isn't important.
