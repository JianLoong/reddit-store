Communication is key.\n\n* You imposed conditions where there were none before (\"it's high in sugar and is expensive\"). Did you have a conversation where you agreed on this, or were you just unilaterally making a decision about what was suddenly not okay?\n\n* To be pregnant, especially in the later trimesters, is to be in a state of constant discomfort.

Yeah unfortunately, taking the side against a pregnant woman specially your wife is a social death sentence in this world so good luck, stay strong, and invest in Coke, maybe they'll send you some lemonade.", "Giving her bottle away was an AH move. I'll focus on the future, though. \n\nHigh in sugar? Probably not too good, then. NAH. Maybe get a bottle and try to replicate it without sugar? YouTube might help and your wife might be able to satisfy her craving \ud83d\ude18", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m also dubious that you actually live in the UK because Minute Maid pink lemonade is available in load of bloody shops, most supermarkets in the \u201cyank section\u201d and even if you can\u2019t be arsed going to them you can buy it on Amazon from the grocery store they have.", "YTA. You gave away what was not yours to give and now you refuse to replace it. If you can afford trips to Disney, you can afford a few bottles of lemonade.\n\nAlso she isn't pouty because she is back in the UK, she is pouty because her husband is an AH.", "YTA", "Oh for crying out loud\u2026it\u2019s not a designer bag, or a Mercedes\u2026it\u2019s freaking lemonade. Sure you need to order it, so there\u2019s shipping, but damn. Pregnant or not\u2026she\u2019s an adult and can buy what she wants. Are you denying yourself every non essential item you want? Plus, you don\u2019t give away stuff, especially stuff your wife bought for herself. This sounds more like you feel you know better than her what she should be consuming and have stepped up to save her from herself. If you look on that website, it\u2019s probably available in sugar free. YTA for giving away her drink and taking the attitude you have.", "YTA. You know that your wife has been craving it and took great lengths to get it, and you told your sister she could have it? The proper way to go about it would've been to just say no, or AT LEAST check to make sure that she wasn't about to drink the last of it. And NOW it's too expensive to replace? Just replace it. Your wife is growing ANOTHER human inside her body, and as a postpartum doula and maternity nurse (newborn care specialist in the US where I live), I can tell you that it takes a LOT for that to happen. \n\nAnother option is to try making a homemade version of it. Freshly squeezed lemon juice, and a bit of grenadine or strawberry puree and a pregnancy safe sweetener that won't spike her blood sugar (monkfruit or liquid stevia). Pink lemonade is lemonade with a hint of strawberry, according to an article that I read a while back.", "YTA for giving away something that wasn't yours, but I'd pay no mind to all the commenters making out that, since she's preggo, you have to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.", "If you could afford a trip to Disney you could definitely afford a few bottles of lemonade for your pregnant wife. Or maybe you couldn\u2019t afford the trip to Disney, then poor planning on your part. Who is the type 1 diabetic? You or her. If its yourself than you have no reason to keep her from her drinks. If shes the diabetic, she knows more about her sugars and her body than you probably do. Im a type 1 and i would never keep my spouse from drinking his favorite drinks.  YTA.", "You are refusing to replace what wasn\u2019t yours to give away? YTA", "YTA. Buy her more lemonade dude", "Oh. So you\u2019re a liar. \n\nYTA", "YTA I said sister could have it as there is a website where we can buy more. Wife: can you order more? OP: No, so why let sister have it when you know its your wives craving and you refuse to let her have more?", "I'm not going to make judgment because I live in Europe too and recognise how difficult finding certain American products here in regular corner stores is so I realise you can't just head to the store and grab one.  But maybe offer an alternative?  Google a pink lemonade recipe? See what the UK has to offer? Order online and let your wife know it'll be there in X days?\n\nBut also, wait to do Disney again until you're in a position to afford lemonade, and more importantly when kid #2 can also enjoy the experience.  \n\nI'm the youngest of three and I've \"gone\" on a lot of holidays that I don't remember because my parents wanted my older two siblings to get to go to Disney, Hawaii, etc. I was physically there, sure, but the \"memories\" I have of it are photo albums my parents showed me later in life. \n\nUnless you can afford to redo the same trips for your other kids when they're old enough to remember, hold off a few years.  I paid for myself to go to Disney when I was 19 or 20 and, fun as it was, I don't think it had the same magic as a kid would experience it.", "OP: I let my sister have it since we can order more online. \n\nAlso OP: We can't order any because sugar and expensive.\n\n\nYTA. Sheesh what is wrong with you?", "ESH\n\nYou for giving away something that doesn\u2019t belong to you, and not replacing it. Her for demanding extra bottles.", "What are delafee truffles? Nm I can Google \ud83e\udd23", "Honestly my thoughts like dude!!!\n\nFirst he acknowledges her cravings\nThought she had more\nTalks about how he can get her more\n\nThen for apology, he goes Nahhh\nHigh in sugar\nWe need the $\nWhy have a craving?\nWhy crave something you paid for and brought back?\n\nOp is THE asshole of assholes", "Yes. My thoughts exactly.", "Lol, I just made pretty much this exact comment. That logic doesn't logic.", "Ya, honestly why is he overruling her here? I would\u2019ve already used my husbands card to order more and told him to cope.

Maybe that's the thought process??", "When I was pregnant and craving expensive stuffs, I always thank having one or two was maybe okay, but saving for kids was a way highter priority, and I shouldnt indulge myself if it mean reducting that saving. Sound like priority are not always the same for everyone", "Probably not the Minute Maid one which is full of artificial dyes and high fructose corn syrup since it\u2019s made in the US where we allow that crap in our food.

It's not the same as type 2; I don't follow a specific diet. In fact, sometimes I need something high in sugar to counter a hypo. Sugar free things can actually be worse for me because body thinks it's getting sugar when it isn't.", "It\u2019s her choice to make though as a grown woman.

Have never tried it before.", "Sure Jan", "But not with your wife I guess, seems you only are looking at her as the incubator that is hosting your child. YTA", "YTA. Buy your wife the lemonade. You gave it away and are now coming up with excuses as to why she doesn't need it.  She does a lot more work than you do to make that baby. Might be a decent father but right now you're being a shit husband.", "Apparently not to their mom though, how sad.", "Sure, you\u2019re a \u201cgood\u201d dad.\n\nWaiting for the next Disney trip when your kid wants a tshirt/toy/whatever and you say it\u2019s too expensive at the park, you\u2019ll buy one at a gift shop, then backtrack and say you need to cut all expenses so nothing for them after all.\n\nYTA", "How about a bad husband? That\u2019s more accurate. Although by the way you speak about your wife you clearly are okay with being a bad hubby.", "I mean you\u2019re not exactly being a great role model for your kid.

And to me it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s demanding more as payment since she had always intended to buy more. Op is the asshole bc he didn\u2019t object to her wanting to buy more until the time for purchase came. They were always gonna have this fight when she ran out bc op is being controlling over soft beverages, but I have to wonder if he gave away the last drink on purpose.

If my advice doesn't fit this in your opinions, fine. I tried.", "You\u2019re giving advice on a topic that not true to the root problem. Ops wife doesn\u2019t have high sugar nor has he said she needs to watch it. OP is the one concerned about sugar and you\u2019re just giving him more ammo to bother her with. She\u2019s pregnant ffs not diabetic, everyone should stop playing M.D. and just give the woman a damn lemonade lol."]}
