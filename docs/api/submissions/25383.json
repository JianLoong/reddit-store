A simple tap on her shoulder to wake her and ask her to turn the music down wouldn't have had that kind of reaction from everyone else.", "If I am going to believe this is real then I am going to have to believe this isn't the full story. Five people including the flight attendant thought you were more than a little out of line? Curious exactly what you did to wake her up and notify her of the behavior you found annoying.", "It seems there are about 4 or 5 unrelated people in your story who all thought you were being the asshole in the way you handled this: aisle guy, flight attendant, person in the row in front of you, sleeping girl herself, etc. Since they were there and I was not, I\u2019ll take my cues from your story people: YTA.", "You're an unreliable narrator. \n\nIf one person said you're an asshole then maybe he's the asshole. \n\nif EVERYONE is saying you're an asshole there is a reason that you aren't telling us. \n\nESPECIALLY the flight attendant.", "YTA. I feel like this is probably very sugarcoated version you\u2019re telling. Flight attendants don\u2019t get snappy for nothing, so you were 99% likely to have been in the wrong. \n\nPlanes are loud, and it\u2019s your responsibility to deal with it or prepare-like bringing earbuds yourself.", "Something about the extreme reactions from everyone around you makes me think you might have come across more negatively than you think. \n\nTentatively I'd say NTA, but if you had a bad attitude in any way it could easily be YTA.", "Info were is the rest of the story because no way people reacted like that for just you asking her to turn down her music", "YTA\n\nyou are not entitled to silence on a plane\n\nyou are not entitled to wake a stranger - and i am guessing that if her music was on you had to physically touch her to wake her \n\nand also? either you bullied an actual child or you are referring to an adult woman as a girl, and so hence YTA", "ESH but you the most. The girl (woman, considering someone bought her wine?) should have been conscious about the volume of her music before she went to sleep. However, you could have brought some earplugs and/or noise canceling headphones on the flight with you - I don't know how anyone travels without them and honestly, you can't expect everyone around you to operate on a noise level that you find acceptable. Airline travel sucks - make your own zone of comfort as best you can. Waking someone up when it's already hard for most people to get some sleep on a plane should be a last resort. It sounds like the other guy in the row might have overreacted, but given how the flight attendant also reacted, I wonder how this whole situation actually went down.", "YTA. I agree I\u2019d be extremely annoyed by this but it\u2019s something you have to deal with. If it was bothering you so much you could\u2019ve also put in earbuds to drown the sound out", "YTA.\n\nIf you are that sensitive to sounds you should always have earplugs. It sounds like everyone around you at the time agreed you were the AH. I mean, if there was a baby crying what would you have done? Asked it to quite down so you could focus on being an AH? Flights are annoying and uncomfortable.", "ESH. It\u2019s your responsibility to anticipate these situations and buy ear plugs or bring your own headphones. Also, the other guy is an AH too and shouldn\u2019t have called you out like that on a public plane. Also the girl should be more considerate but also bleeding sound from headphones is pretty common no matter how quiet or loud they are listening to them.", "YTA. She was sleeping; she didn't know her music was bleeding out of the headphones, so \"common courtesy\" has nothing to do with it on her part. But common courtesy on your part dictates not waking a sleeping person for a frivolous reason. If you are distractible enough that the small amount of noise coming from her headphones makes it impossible to read, it is your responsibility to travel with earplugs.", "YTA- this reminds me of that entitled lady on a train asking a guy to turn his headphones down because it was bothering her and it\u2019s \u201cfirst class\u201d. And he needed to be more posh or something and keep it down. \n\nI get annoyed when people have loud videos on in public too. But, if they aren\u2019t my husband, I can\u2019t ask them to turn it down. A plane is a public space. She had headphones on. She wasn\u2019t doing anything to bother anyone. You were in the wrong. I\u2019m curious how she reacted though. All we see is about how others did.", "There is no way anyone can sleep to the volume of music you\u2019re describing as \u2018bothering\u2019\nShe would have never tolerated the volume herself if it was that bothering OUTSIDE the headphones. \nAlthough you may have your reasons, waking up someone only am hour after the start of a long flight is obnoxious. You could have asked for the assistance of the flight attendant from the beginning. They could have handled it by at least moving you to an empty seat (always happens during flights)", "I\u2019m curious what \u201cthin ice\u201d means an hour into a long flight. \n\nBut there\u2019s really no point in coming to this sub.,\nwhen you\u2019ve already had the feedback from several people who were actually there.", "YTA she was sleeping", "NTA.

Having you earbuds turned up loud enough in a crowded place is and of itself and an incredibly insensitive move.  As the late US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., stated \u201cyour right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.\u201d  Or in this case a person's right to blaring music ends where other people's hearing begins.", "She was using the music to block out noise and sleep. How she sleeps is none of your business. I once got stuck in front of a man who could have been heard snoring at an Aerosmith concert. Guess what\u2026no one woke him up to make him stop snoring. We just dealt with it. YTA.", "Multiple people indicated you were an asshole, and now you've come to spin some likely watered down version of the story to seek validation from a bunch of strangers on the Internet?\n\nYou've received the verdict on your behavior. The universe has spoken. YTA.", "YTA. But come on, tell us the whole story. Theres no way this is it.", "YTA because literally everyone in your story says you are.", "Yta- based off the provided information other people felt you were out of line. Honestly I don\u2019t see how her music could be so loud that it disrupts you reading and even still you could have had common courtesy and left her alone. It wasn\u2019t a big deal to hear music while reading", "YTA it\u2019s common courtesy to not bother someone sleeping on a long flight. Unless they\u2019re like a parent and their child is being annoying.", "YTA \n\nShe had earbuds in, she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s supposed to be doing. Airplanes are uncomfortable and you\u2019re going to hear all kinds of annoying noises, that\u2019s true for everyone. No one needs to cater their flight experience to your lack of patience nor lack of preparedness. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be annoyed by sounds on the plane bring your own earbuds, or earplugs, or noise canceling headphones. Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on their part.", "The only AH here was the guy trying to get into her pants.", "Assuming you woke her up gently and asked politely, NTA. This sorta thing is kinda expected in public spaces. She was bothering you, you informed her of this in a responsible manner, and had the guy next to you not made a big deal out of it she probably would've gone back to sleep afterwards and that would've been the end of it. Better to let someone know they're bothering you than to let your annoyance build up.", "YTA. Because primarily, you can have alternative solutions instead of waking the person up which is rude. Yeah you have preference of reading in silence but remember, a plane is still a public transportation and you don't have any right to interrupt a sleeping passenger unless needed. \nHere are some alternative actions you should've done:\n\n1.put earplugs so you'll read in peace\n2. Put headphones yourself and put chill music or classical music loud enough for u to not hear her music\n3. Find another way to keep yourself busy besides reading", "INFO - as many people have pointed out too many people got mad far to quickly in this story. \n\nThe reason for my comment: Headphones for pink noise/green noise/white noise on low or just a buffer, earplugs or something like loops... Next time be less of a YTA OP... even seems like an overreaction from the story...", "INFO: you don\u2019t mention how the girl reacted when you woke her up. Or actually anything she said or did except someone else bought her wine. There is something missing from your story here - either she overreacted to your polite request or (and I\u2019m leaning this way) you overreacted with the way you were \u201csuper annoyed\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward YTA especially as everyone at the scene said so. Especially a flight attendant - they have the patience of saints so you must have done something bad to be on \u201cthin ice\u201d.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA because I have sensory issues and headphones that are so loud that I can hear them grate on my nerves, too. Stack that on top of my hatred of flights as well as public travel and crowds, and I am not a happy camper.\n\nI think everyone overreacted to your humble request. It\u2019s not as if you shook her by the shoulders violently or punched her awake, yeah? No, I highly doubt that, it sounds more like they all made a fuss over you trying to maintain your comfort zone.\n\nEveryone\u2019s comfort is to be respected on flights \u2014 the girl in headphones will be just fine turning her volume down to an agreeable volume that doesn\u2019t disturb others around her.", "YTA next time pack earplugs or noise cancelling headphones", "YTA\n\nYou would have to work hard to hear someone else\u2019s headphones on a plane.  Most people can barely hear their own.\n\nOn the off-chance you could hear them, you could have simply worn your own. Or asked the flight attendant for a headset. Or asked for ear plugs.
