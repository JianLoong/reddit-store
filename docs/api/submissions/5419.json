Graphic images and content are never appropriate to send without the recipient's permission. My best friend is a doctor, worked in the ER for a few years, and even I asked her if it was OK to send her pictures of my hand after I slammed it in the car door. Just no.", "Nta, like you said it's one thing if she texted you wanting to talk and another to just randomly send a picture of what happened. \n\nNot everything needs to be shared on social media , so don't let people make you feel guilty for having boundaries.", "NTA!!! The picture was inappropriate and she should not have sent it. Yes, she needed someone to talk to. She should have talked, not sent that picture. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat wasn\u2019t appropriate. She should go to the ER. To make sure there isn\u2019t any afterbirth or anything left over. That could cause serious medical issues pretty quick. Then she needs to schedule an appointment with an OBGYN.", "NTA. That is disgusting, and she could have talked to you about it without sending a damn picture.", "NTA a phone call would have sufficed.", "NTA\n\nThere was no need to use a graphic image to inform you had a miscarriage. Maybe she was in shock and needed someone else to confirm they were seeing what she was seeing. \n\nDoes she have a partner? \n\nHer actions make me wonder if the pregnancy was unplanned and forced on her. If she's having unprotected sex, then pregnancy is always a possibility. Very odd behaviour on her part. Hope she knows who the dad  was, and that it wasn't a forced situation.", "NTA. Grief can make people do crazy things, but this was extremely insensitive of her, especially with literally zero context.\n\nYou were not being insensitive at all to state that pictures of dead fetuses are a hard boundary for you.\n\nIf she wanted support, she could have told you what happened and asked for it. She didn't want support, she wanted to freak you out the same way she was freaked out. Which is an *extremely* selfish response. \n\nI know I'm going to get thrashed for saying that in this sub, but I have had eleven miscarriages (totally infertile lady here, IVF failures, the works) and I would NEVER do this to anyone I knew.", "NTA \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be better to have told you in text or a call that she has miscarried. I understand that she was in shock but sending that kind of photo with or without any context is wrong without consent. I would explain that to her. You are there for her but sending that photo was disturbing.", "NTA. That is about the most disgusting, attention-seeking behavior ever.", "Personally I feel emotionally assaulted when people force me to view upsetting things, which is what happens when you send images without asking or warning. NTA", "NTA - isn't that some kind of low-level assault, to ambush someone with a horrifyingly graphic photo of something without warning or prior explanation?  She delights in shocking you? How unpleasant. I would be mad as well. I disagree you were \"being a little insensitive\" for expressing your discomfort. \n\nThat said, I'd also do a reverse image search on Google to make sure it wasn't just a photo taken from the internet...", "NTA she doesn't have the right to send you graphic images. It's like sending someone any graphic pictures, and if you're also a girl, it's not like SHE knows 100% that you never miscarried and she might be triggering your own grief. \n\nShe might be having a hard time but she just trauma dumped on you in a bad way, she can't complain that you're the insensitive one.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIt is bizarre to send a picture of a miscarriage regardless of what stage she was at or if she knew or any other factor. That's absolutely rank to send something like that with no context", "NTA.\n\nThere's literally hundreds of ways she could have told you. Sending a pic of miscarriaged fetus is not the way to go, without a warning too.", "NTA- It wasn't a real picture. They don't give a dead fetus to even the parents after death. Let alone a bloody image. There's a lot to this that doesn't hold up. I suggest a Google image look up. I bet it pops up. When something does, cut her out. That's fucking crazy.", "NTA I had a similar thing happen with my friend\u2019s placenta. I understand there are health benefits to ingesting it after birth and that animals do it in the wild, but I do not need to see a video of your husband chopping it up stir frying it to serve to your family \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA, you are right, she could have told you without the picture. Sending that without context, just to see what your reaction would be, is a great example of being insensitive. Your reaction to that picture is not.", "NTA. Wow. Incredibly insensitive of her. She can take any pictures she wants but she should absolutely have let you know before sending. It wasn't a puppy...", "NTA for not wanting unsolicited fetus pics but please don't assume she's not grieving. You can grieve for anything, including the potential for life you didn't know you carried.", "NTA. Sending graphic pictures without warning or consent under pretty much any  (I'm allowing for the possibility that there might be some exception that I can't think of) circumstances is not cool. If she needed to talk, she could have talked to you, there was no reason to open with a graphic photo and go from there.", "NTA Asking a friend for support during a miscarriage is one thing. Sending an unsolicited graphic image with no context is another.", "NTA. What she did was inappropriate.", "NTA\n\n> She says she needed some to tell and I was the only person she could talk to.\n\n#So *TELL* and *TALK*.\n\nNot **_show_** that awful sight.", "NTA.  Perhaps your friend was traumatized by what happen but she absolutely did not need to send you that picture - especially without any warning or context.\n\nShe needed to talk and that's understandable.  But sending that picture wasn't right.", "If I sent my cousin a picture of a drop of blood, she would faint. You cannot send and post graphic blood stuff without a warning!!! And this is like 10 levels past that..", "NTA, she needs to apologize for overstepping serious boundaries. You can still be incredibly supportive without having to see that ):", "NTA. Your friend has no boundaries and should naturally expect a reaction like yours when she trauma dumps on people.", "NTA that was cruel.  You don't have to have her trauma shoved in your face to be empathetic.", "Grief makes you do things you normally would not do, however you are NTA. A picture like that should never be sent.", "NTA.  That\u2019s disturbing and never appropriate to send.  Personally I would block her because her behavior sounds odd.", "NTA\n\nThat's definitely not the kind of thing to send someone with no warning. \n\nBut a small hint of ESH due to this line :\n\n>To be fair she didn\u2019t know she was pregnant, so it\u2019s not like she was grieving or anything.", "NTA, this wasn't her telling someone about what happened to her, this was her sending you a graphic image to trigger a reaction from you. It was absolutely inappropriate and you were right to confront her", "Nta", "NTA. I literally just commented on something this morning that I hadn't quite lost all faith in humanity and then I read this.\n\nMaybe it was a trauma response? Maybe your friend is just completely unhinged. Either way, I'm really sorry.", "NTA, JESUS\n\nI get that she was upset, I would be devastated if I had a miscarriage too, BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT IN THE FIRST PLACE. \n\nYour friend needs therapy. That wasn't ok, and she never should have sent that picture.\n\nNgl you would probably benefit from a little therapy too after being made to see that.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have sent you the picture with no context and you shouldn\u2019t assume that she\u2019s not grieving or upset because she didn\u2019t know about the pregnancy.

Not normal \nNTA btw", "NTA\nShe could have told you without sending a picture. I understand she wanted someone to talk to, but that picture was unnecessary.\nThat can be very triggering for many reasons!", "My friend actually did this, but she wasn't mentally stable due to an immense amount of drug use. I didn't know what to day not did I feel that I had the right to ruin whatever moment she may have been having.

It's very sad that she had a miscarriage but she sucks for sending you such a horrible graphic image out of the blue. Nobody wants to see that unexpectedly.", "I had a miscarriage 7 months ago at 3 months along. I would NEVER send someone a photo of my miscarried child. Never ever. It was so traumatic, I could never imagine sending an image like that to a friend. If you need to talk about it, that's different... But the photo would be disturbing to most.

Pretty much", "NTA\n\nNo unsolicited nudes.\nNo unsolicited pics of bodies or gory stuff.\nNo unsolicited poop or pee pics.\n\nShe could\u2019ve just used her words. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d need proof.", "YTA. Who are you to say she isn\u2019t grieving? A miscarriage is a very traumatic thing and unless your friend knew this would insult you (like you had a past of miscarriages or were currently pregnant, etc) then I think she was just trying to share with a friend. Sure, maybe she should have asked you first but I think you\u2019re overreacting and being insensitive.

The friend should never have sent a picture like that, and OP is TA for minimizing their friend's feelings.", "That was OP assigning emotions to someone else and making huge assumptions. Just because you don't know you're pregnant DOES NOT mean pregnancy loss doesn't hit hard.\n\nHer friend never said she wasn't grieving, and she literally told OP she needed to reach out and talk to somebody, which is a grief indicator.\n\nAll of that said, I am not defending the friend's behavior at all.", "I wouldn\u2019t go that far. There is an influencer I follow on Instagram who posts her stillborn babies picture like 20 times a year for hundreds of thousands of people to see. I just don\u2019t think everyone would be offended by it (I wouldn\u2019t) so the friend made a bad judgement call indeed but she\u2019s not an asshole. OP is for their reaction.", "Thankyou for this. I misscarried without knowing I was pregnant. I bled for months and spent months crying everytime I went to the bathroom and saw chunks of MY baby coming out of me. Her friend will be grieving not only the loss of a baby but the loss of a choice she should of had to make. \n\nI also don't nessicerly think the friend was an asshole. Depending on the relationship but me and my friends would send eachother maybe a photo or something if we needed advice. In my friend group we've felt eachothers books and seen vaginas it's girls checking on girls.", "Stillborn babies are cleaned and nurses put clothes on (if the baby is big enough, if not a hat&blanket) so that the family can say goodbye&take photos if they wish to. \n\nA miscarriage is a lot more messy, the fetus is small and cannot be cleaned and there's blood. The situations are very different.", "Stillborn babies are not the same as miscarried fetal tissue", "I miscarried at 8 weeks. I remember very graphic details about the moment I miscarried and that feeling of panic when I passed the baby in the bathroom at work and not knowing what to do about it. \n\nI can put myself in the friends shoes because I really had no idea. It probably wasn\u2019t appropriate to send, but idk if I can fault the friend.", "Not the one I\u2019m talking about. Whatever I was just trying to make a point. I think the friend misjudged but I don\u2019t think it makes her an asshole. I just think the OP is being incredibly insensitive and should have just moved on. There\u2019s no need to bash the friend when she\u2019s already gonna through something awful."]}
