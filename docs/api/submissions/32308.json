This was an interaction with someone who is essentially a stranger to you now and you don't owe them anything.", "NTA. They are not entitled to forgiveness. You can easily move on but you don't have to forgive them. And fuck those friends telling you to \"grow up.\" They obviously have never been bullied before and do not get a say in whether you should forgive them. I'd cut those friends out for saying shit like that.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "You said that they expected you to forgive them to make them feel better. Doesn't sound like the right reason to me. You're entitled to your emotions and to decide whether or not to forgive them, so NTA.", "NTA obviously. I question these \u201cmutual friends\u201d reaction, though.", "NTA. Get better friends.", "NTA. No one is entitled to your forgiveness. \nIgnore them.", "Bullies don't deserve any forgiveness.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Awful people generally want absolution, not forgiveness.", "NTA. Nope, not one bit. You owe those trolls nothing. I\u2019m 34 and still hurt from the mental gymnastics I endured. My mother is 69 and still has bad flashbacks to the nasty women who tormented her.\n\nDespite what bullies may think, there is no statute of limitations on being a dick. One can apologize all they wish, but we are under no obligation to accept. As long as we handle ourselves with proper decorum, they can kick rocks.", "NTA. You are never obligated to forgive a bully, especially ones that were seemingly doing it only to make themselves feel better. Even while apologising, one of them was still denying ever having done anything to you. They're still only thinking of themselves rather than what you as their victim deserve and need and these 'mutual friends' clearing don't understand or care about the impact bullying can have. They are just trying to force you to be 'the bigger person' because it is easier for them.", "Something similar recently happened to me. Your bullies never said anything to make you feel good (the complete opposite actually), and now they expect you to say that you forgive them so they can feel good about themselves??? F these people and F bullies. Definitely NTA", "Don't forgive them.  Tell them they're evil assholes and horrible human beings, and a waste of skin. Grin while you say this. Laugh. Ask for a strand of their hair so you can make voodoo dolls of them.  When done, wish them a nice day. Tell the mutual friends the same thing. \n\nNTA \n\nAt all.", "Im 42, and I still have not - and never will - forgive my high school bullies.\n\nHell, I openly celebrated when one of them died.\n\nNTA", "No if you don\u2019t feel that forgiveness is necessary or worth it then DON\u2019T! Forget about them if you can. Waste no more time on those who aren\u2019t worth it.", "You should know forgiving is often more about releasing the bully\u2019s power over you than anything else. Forgetting (as in not holding it on them, like you seem to be) is something else, and should be taken on case by case basis. The good news is one of the girls seems genuinely sorry, and another wishes she wasn\u2019t there, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be nice/socialize/or let them off the hook. I can\u2019t pass judgement on cases like these, but can ask you one question-would you rather have those girls experience what you did (and the lasting trauma), or would you prefer they were just always casual with you. Cause if it\u2019s the latter, you maybe already moved on", "Anyone can ask for forgiveness, but no one is entitled to it - you forgive someone if it makes **you** feel better, not because it makes **them** feel better.\n\nThe fact that they are apparently still trashing you shows you that they haven't changed at all - they're still toxic A Hs, and completely undeserving of the slightest consideration or thought.\n\nNTA.", "Not judging either way - but forgiveness is for you not them really. \n\nForgiveness shows that you have processed the situation and moved on living your best life, not leaving them free real estate in your head.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
