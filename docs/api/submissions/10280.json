They should not be home during the day.\n\nDrunk cooking?  Where are they getting the money to afford alcohol?", "NTA.  your husband's brother and partner are acting inconsiderately.  Inviting strangers to your house is rude and dangerous.  OP, you are not out of line.  \n\nI would discuss this situation with your husband:  both you and your husband need to be on the same page. How much longer do your in-laws have  until they are re-located?  can they move at an extended stay hotel?", "Your household rules are *far* stricter than anything I would have, so believe me when I say NTA, they are MAJORLY overstepping and you are not being neurotic. I wouldn't forbid guests from inviting other people over, but holy hell I would not be ok with them bringing over 1. people they just met 2. at midnight 3. when I'm not there 4. without asking, only telling me after the fact. They didn't just step over the very clear boundary you gave them, they took a running start and crashed through it like they were playing Red Rover. And they have cats spraying in your new house??? I'm a huge animal person and I was mortified the *one* time my dog peed in somebody else's house and kept an eagle eye out every time we set foot in another person's house to make sure he never did it again.\n\nGet your husband on the same page as you so you have support (you shouldn't be the only one upholding your boundaries, btw! Where is he in this??) and tell them you expect them to be out at the end of the month as expected. Maybe you would have been willing to extend it, but they have shown they don't respect you or the rules you set for your house, they stretched your goodwill too far, and that door is closed now.

They did it anyway.\n\nKick them out, they admitted it was better to seek forgiveness then ask permission and the only way to deal with such AH is to make them face consequences for their BS.\n\nLike, you don't even have to discuss this, any guest is \"two yes or one no\" and your yes just became a no so their stay is over.", "NTA They broke your rules and it would be fair to tell them to get out now. \n\nI would also not be okay with strangers in my home, especially when I'm not there. It is an extremely reasonable boundary. If they want to bring home whoever they want they need to hurry up and get their own place. \n\nIf you're not quite ready to boot them, I suggest using this time, while they know they are on thin ice, to initiate some consequences that benefit you:\n\n1. Demand a report on their progress towards finding their own place.  Possibly even make it something they have to do periodically to prove they are on track.\n2. Insist the male cats get fixed. I know in the US there are programs that will help people get them fixed even if the don't have much money. Helped me with my girl when I was a poor college student. Ease the way by looking up the programs first and maybe even making the appointment for them. They either make the appointment or they are out because the cats are clearly pissing in more than their litter box. \n3. Also, they need to clean that up. \n\nNow you also need to decide with your husband if a second strike means they are out. If either one of you feels like that's a yes, then it is a yes. If it's a yes, your husband (not you) needs to tell them this immediately so they know. If it's a no, don't tell them because that's inviting them to do it again because they know they'll still get another chance (plus if the next stranger guest trashes your house or steals from you, you will want to change your mind and don't need to hear from them how they were supposed to get three strikes or whatever.)\n\nIf you can afford it, get a camera doorbell on your front and back doors so they can't easily sneak people into your home. Make sure the camera range covers your garage if you have one. Chances are they have already been sneaking people in and this is just the first time you caught them.\n\nFinally, know that you can just be done with having them around even if they haven't recently broken a rule. It's called overstaying your welcome and I have a feeling if it weren't for the cats they are already there. But with the cats fixed, you can also just choose to kick the humans out. It's much easier to find temporary digs if you don't have a pet and they can work from there towards finding a pet friendly place.\n\nThere is a risk that they will never come back for the cats though. So you would need to make a plan and maybe even have them sign an agreement that after x time they have ceded their rights to the cats and you will rehome them or they're now your cats and no take backs.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "NTA\n\nYour house - your rules. Your guests need to respect that. If they don't then that means that they don't respect you and you should just throw them out of your house!\n\nAlso, who TF brings strangers home??? It's weird.

At least I don't think I am.", "Oh fuck no. \u201cWe didn\u2019t ask because you would say no\u201d gets you thrown out of the house immediately.", "Don't even get me started on the Stephen Universe ones.", "Lol well I hope you enjoy your permanent roommates.

It permeates into walls and floors. If the room has carpet or wood floors, you will need to tear it all out to ever get rid of the smell. May also need to tear out the walls if they're sheetrock as it will also soak into that and be impossible to get rid of.\n\nETA: Pee is fairly easy to get out if you act quickly enough, but it's not the same when a male cat sprays. That's basically a mist that instantly soaks into shit. I had a cat that did it to my shoes and some of my clothes. All had to be trashed because the smell wouldn't come out of the clothes no matter how times you soaked and washed them. You'd think it did, but as soon as you started to sweat a tiny bit in the clothes the smell instantly came back.", "I'd go ahead and give them a reasonable expectation of a date they need to be out by.

Tell them you know they won't like the decision but now it's done as they brought it up on themselves.", "NTA \nThey are beyond rude. You have to evict them. Good luck.", "Never, never, never.", "There's a lot of hiring going on right now all over the place.  Many of those jobs are not ones you'd quit your current job for.  However, if you have **no** job, it's not hard to become employed.\n\nNot sure on tenancy laws in your area but you might start thinking about how you remove them from your home lawfully with force.  Where I live, it requires going to court and getting sheriffs involved, roughly 30-45 days from initial filing.\n\nEven if it doesn't come to this, you really ought to know your rights etc.  Don't just let them push you around and disrespect you anymore.", "When we got our family home as an inheritance, we had to clean up some really old furniture (with some really expensive fabrics) and carpets as there had been cats in the house and we're all allergic to their hair. We got these really strong house furniture and carseats cleaner (it has a kind of plastic brush on top) and used it, had to use it once a day for 2-3 days and all the smell and hair were gone. The trick is to cover the \"soap soaked\" parts with semi wet towels, it makes the dirt attach to the towels and leave everything pristine. The towels are easy to wash if you use a high temperature program in the wading machine.

The roommate left his clothes on the floor to get peed on constantly  and thus he smelled off pee. I don't know what was more ridiculous that they didn't bother to take care of the issue or the fact that no one in that house believed me when I said that male spray was cat pee and that they were letting the toddler crawl on the floor in cat pee. That house was so disgusting. Huge flea issue, to the point that several pets died from anemia. Cats allowed to pee whereever. The untrained dog ripped through the chicken coop and that was a nightmare. The roommates got CPS called on them, and animal control. They'd clean the house long enough for CPS/Animal services to go away then go right back to letting mold grow on the countertops.", "haaah. love your screen name and how appropriate you would know this (cute black cat for non Japanese speakers)!   : )   so the claner didn't damage the fabric dyes? I love this towel idea.  Will keep that in mind.", "I was going to say, white vinegar is great too.", "u/SentenceofJudgement that's why Nature's Miracle is so awesome.  The enzymes actually tear apart the molecules of urine and scenting.  It doesn't clean it as much as convert it into water and gases.   Even after drying.   As long as it can soak through.   : )", "Can confirm. The 1st house I ever bought, the owners had 3 cats. Noticed the house smelled a bit in 2 of the rooms. The owner said it's just the litter box. Really didn't matter anyway, I was going to buy the house no matter what. All of the drywall had to be torn out and replaced in 3 rooms. It was soaked in cat urine from the floor to about knee high in 2 rooms and floor to shoulder level in the living room because the cats sprayed the wall while they were standing on the couch. All the carpet was thrown out. Cat urine HAS to be treated right away, or it will stink no matter how much cleaning you do.", "NTA. They\u2019re going to do it again. They don\u2019t respect you at all and you\u2019re being a doormat. You need to tell them to leave as it\u2019s not working out.", "NTA.  Talk with your husband.

They need to respect your rules, your home and most of all YOU. They knew you wouldn\u2019t like it and did it anyway. They are staying for free and can\u2019t even be decent enough to respect your wishes? You need to double down and make sure they understand how you feel about there lack of respect.

They had no right to invite those people over.", "NTA\n\nBut I truly don't understand how having cats fouling up your home is YOUR justification for not kicking the brother, his partner AND the two cats out immediately. \n\nWhy would you have allowed two cats into your home to stink it up in the first place.\n\nObviously this is going to happen over and over again because the brother doesn't give a flying fuck regarding what the \"rules\" are. He knows what they are and doesn't even have the grace to even attempt to come up with any kind of excuse except he wanted to do it.\n\nFrankly you are a kind of asshole yourself for allowing yourself to be treated in this kind of very insulting manner.", "It's honestly time for them to be moving on.  NTA.", "Relocate and get back on their feet - sounds like a lot of spin when they\u2019re out partying with strangers and bringing them back to your place. \n\nIf they\u2019re really in a regrouping and rebuilding phase and living in someone else\u2019s home - they need to be humble and act like it\u2019s not their f\u2019ing house and lay low and be respectful. \n\nGet your partner to straighten this up, it\u2019s not on you.

I sanded, I used several coats of clear KILZ and polyurethane, and I can STILL smell that rank odor when I walk down the stairs. The wood is also totally messed up and was peeling apart while I was sanding. I have to get the whole landing replaced. \n\nOP, get them out. They\u2019re literally pissing all over your investment and you may to need to replace the floors in that room. NTA.", "Two unaltered males scent marking? It\u2019s a deodorizer,  not the second coming of Christ. That will have sunk straight in to whatever it\u2019s landed on.
