Complete strangers, liked their vibe and invited them over to the house(around midnight) they are guests at when specifically told not to as an initial boundary. \n\nI realllly wanted to tell them to get out right then. The main reason I\u2019m not is because they have two cats (unaltered males that are making the spare bedroom smell terrible) and it\u2019s not their fault their owners are doing stupid things.\n\nThey apologized and said it won\u2019t happen again, but admitted that they knew I wouldn\u2019t be happy about it.

Btw, they are very reasonable rules.When you saw wat they did, you were disturbed and afraid for your safety and for the safety of your home. \nA simple ultimatum like \"If you at least think about inviting other people to my house, I will ask you to leave\" is more than generous at this point.

You are well within your rights to kick them out. Keeping the peace would be setting a time line, you have two months to find somewhere else. Above and beyond would be give them a final warning and a chance to make it up... but it's a final warning.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. You are clear about it and yet they broke it, the infuriating part is, they are just a guests.

Why do I think that your husband's brother is never going to leave? The next post will be AITA for refusing to pay my husband's brother $5K to leave.

Your house your rules and your rules are very understandable and not weird at all in any way. So in order to stay at your home (and for free even) they should abide by your rules. Them not complying with the rules shows they don't respect you and they don't respect your authority over your own home. You are so kind to help them in need and they take advantage of you.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean about their 2 male cats stinking up the guest bedroom? Do you mean the litter boxes stink or are they spraying and/or peeing on things? If it is the second option, perhaps you should also create a rule that in order for them to stay in your home both male cats need to be castrated. That will also help with option 1 btw since their urine will smell less after castration.", "NTA, I would hate being in the situation you are in.", "NTA. They aren't your guests, they are just taking advantage of you. Just as a start, those cats need to be neutered, and the costs of professional cleaning paid by them.", "NTA. You made simple rules and they ignored them. Even people who aren't more extroverted don't want guests leaving a mess in their kitchen and uninvited people living in a spare bedroom!

You should be comfortable in your own home.", "They're never going to neuter the cats, they'll never follow your rules and they're never moving out.
