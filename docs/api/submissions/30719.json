I do think the situation is more complicated than some think, given we have our own adult children with their own issues. But I spoke with her, made sure she understood she is welcome here even if we aren't planning to do exactly what she would prefer.

She created this 'crisis' by moving too far away. \n\nYes Mom, if you want a full feast made for your sake you can make it because I'm not going to do all that. No Mom, I'm not leaving town to come to yours for T'Giving and Christmas both.

This is an uncomfortable level of indifference toward your own mother.", "So, it doesn't sound as though you actually warmly invited her to come to you, and it sounds as though you maybe took slight offence to her seeming to 'demand' that you cooked Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nOn the other hand, it sounds as though she might have quite set ideas of how 'Thanksgiving' ought to be. (Full disclosure: I think holiday dinners are great, but only if everybody involved wants to do them. Nobody should feel 'obliged' to put on a huge spread of traditional food just because other family members fancy it).\n\nSo I'm leaning towards e s h, but maybe you could reach out to her again and say that you know she's disappointed about maybe not doing a traditional Thanksgiving dinner; it's not something you can do at the moment but you'd love to see her, and she's still very welcome to come and eat hearty stew or whatever you end up making.\n\nIf she still refuses to come, then that's on her.", "NTA, if you dont want to go or elaborate a fancy dinner just dont do it.", "She knows about Christmas, we are already talking about the when & hows lol. And while I didn't mention it, my son is on the spectrum & doesn't have much of a relationship with his father, so I feel guilty about abandoning him also, as he is uncomfortable with travel so probably won't go. And I didn't really mention it, but she brought up asking if I was doing Thanksgiving, which I said that I really hadn't thought about it at that time, but if I did it probably wouldn't be the whole shebang, as that just isn't something I'm interested in.", "Very close to my own thoughts, thank you. I don't enjoy the hassle of thanksgiving and making everyone try to show up at a certain time to eat their 2nd or 3rd meal of the day. And so I offered a compromise, which my mom isn't interested in. Also, it is MY DAD that died. I'm still not over it, I'm still struggling with grief myself. In some ways, my mom has moved on easier than I have, which I don't begrudge her but doesn't mean I'm ok.", "He was my dad too. And I do feel a bit abandoned she decided to move off 4 hours from me, but wants me to drive up to see her. She could have stayed closer to me, but chose not to.", "Hmm, she didn't mention cooking here, and she is the one who said she wouldn't come here if I wasn't willing to do the whole traditional thanksgiving (which I've never done, never enjoyed, and there are only generally 6 of us that actually show up, if that many)", "Oh, and again, I'm very sorry for your loss. Last year was really hard, this year is less hard, but more complicated due to the distances involved", "I'm sorry you lost your mom, I'm still grieving my dad 2 years later, and I'm sure I will be worse when my mom goes. I actually am meh about turkey, but my husband doesn't like it lol. I'd rather have ham. What I am actually opposed to is trying to set a specific time to eat, like \"We will be eating at 5, and everyone must be here at that point\". The stress is hard on me, balancing everyone's schedules is hard on me. And we are a blended family, so there is weirdness there too, with people having multiple families to deal with.", "honestly that your mom passed this year is probably clouding your judgement or you misunderstood bc OP is in no way the asshole, neither is his mom but she can't expect to move 4 hours away and assume that her family is going to come to her, if they don't want to go that's fine, NAH", "My dad was extremely difficult, probably on the spectrum like my son. My mom is seeing someone in her hometown, and has been since before she moved. Which I'm happy for her about, although I worry she's perhaps moving to fast. She would be welcome to come here, she doesn't want to if I don't want to do the traditional sit down at a specific time dinner (which is hard for our combined 4 kids). So, I feel like she wants to have her cake and eat it too.", "That's what I feel like I did, that I wasn't going to do the whole traditional dinner, and she said that she wouldn't come here if I wasn't.", "Perhaps some, but not a lot from what I can tell, they had a difficult relationship, because my dad was a difficult person. I'm still mourning him, but I'm also mourning the relationship as it was. I think she's to some degree bottling emotion, but has moved on with her life, ie, seeing someone new, selling their house and moving hours away, etc. I know my mom, if I went up this year, she'd expect that I'd come up every year for thanksgiving, despite the fact we went up to visit my grandparents for thanksgiving exactly once. Money is tight, and I'd prefer not to make two trips within 30 days of each other (a fact she's aware of).", "This part is true. If I were OP, I would drive out to moms and take her to lunch ASAP to gently explain the situation/option/boundaries. \n\nI would plan to drive and visit her at least monthly if not already doing it. But the \"wanting it all\" holiday demands are just not tenable.", "You are right, and I appreciate the understanding of the situation. I talked to her today to make sure she understood she was invited, even if our plans were not exactly what she would prefer. She had already decided to go have Thanksgiving with her oldest sister and her husband.", "I did not say no, she said she didn't want to if I didn't do the full sit-down menu. She also won't go to a restaurant, I've tried multiple times. And she is not and would not be alone, she has 5 brothers & sisters, and multiple cousins, nieces, nephews, etc.", "I mean, I get that. But it definitely can be difficult. Do I abandon my son who struggles with his mental health to drive up for a holiday I don't enjoy? Does my husband leave his kids or not go with me, splitting us up for the holiday? Things get complicated, and her moving a half day's drive away to be closer to her other family just makes it harder to schedule.", "Thank you! And yes, I do think she has a very \"set\" idea of how it should be, and I'm just not up to all that this year. And you are right, she kind of surprised me when she asked, because I really hadn't thought much about it at the time. So I certainly wasn't as gracious as I could have been. I did call her this morning after the commentary to make sure she understood she was welcome here even if it wouldn't be the exactly scenario she wanted. She's already accepted an invite from her oldest sister apparently.", "That does make sense with your son. I really think just explaining your feelings and being firm with your desire to stay home is the best route. Don't let her make you feel guilty, cuz it sounds like she will have plenty of holiday company. Can you contact family to make sure she has plans? \nYour response reminds of just how complicated families are! There's always another layer of explanation. Good luck", "This sounds like your trying to punish her for moving", "She offered to come to you and you declined.", "Ok, you are pissed.  So let\u2019s say for the sake of argument, this is the last Thanksgiving with her.  Are you going to regret not doing it, or are you going to be happy you did?", "> she didn't mention cooking here, and she is the one who said she wouldn't come here if I wasn't willing to do the whole traditional thanksgiving\n\nThat doesn't automatically mean *you* have to cook it all yourself. If you thought so, why not ask her to team up on the meal?   A parent who is willing to cook at their own place isn't likely to refuse to help their own child at theirs. Maybe your mother is different I guess.\n\nThe number of people in attendance and the holiday meal itself seem to be the main issues for you. So be it.", "I truly empathize with your situation. It seems like your trying to accommodate everyone but upset because they don\u2019t like your choices. It\u2019s really okay to say it won\u2019t work out this year but we will see you at Christmas. Mom can be disappointed that\u2019s okay too. But I don\u2019t think I understand why you believe she\u2019s trying to make this challenging for you. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty if you don\u2019t go & you don\u2019t have to feel bad if you don\u2019t want a traditional sit down dinner. \n\nShe wants a turkey. Tell her to bring one along & you will throw it in the oven. If the kids show up great! If not y\u2019all just eat whenever you want to.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry for your loss. I am learning how hard it is to not be able to have anymore time with someone that meant so much to me. Give yourself a little grace. Give your Mom a little grace. Holidays are especially hard. Traditions without a loved one are often about once again facing the reality of loss. \n\nI hope everything works out in the way you want & y\u2019all have a relaxing & enjoyable Thanksgiving. \n\n(We have always hosted Thanksgiving (& every other holiday at our house). I have 3 sisters with spouses & between us we have 8 grown kids with partners & kids \u2026 our house is the only house that fits everyone. Just our immediate family is like 30 people. It was always easier for my parents to always come to our house than all of us go to their house. It is going to be very strange this year without Mom. We have no expectations. Just eat & drink & happy we are able to be together)\n\neta \u2014 congratulations on your son proposing! That\u2019s exciting stuff!", "OP\u2019s Mom said she will come to her house. She would like to have turkey. Throw a breast of turkey in the oven \u2026 make some potatoes & a vegetable. It\u2019s really not challenging.\n\nIt appears OP is not willing to be flexible. If she doesn\u2019t want to see Mom then just tell her \u201cwe are staying home. You\u2019re more than welcome to come. There will be no turkey\u201d. Let Mom make her decision.", "How old are your kids?\n\neta \u2014 the reason I ask is I do understand trying to schedule with adult children can be challenging. We have 4 (26,26,28,30) they all have SOs & our oldest son & youngest daughter both have public service jobs (paramedic & resident psychologist) so we do try to plan around their work schedules. \n\nHowever, if family is coming then we just plan a time to eat. Show up whenever you can kids.", "What you're describing is a way of mourning, not necessarily moving on. She's trying to not have anything that reminds her of her husband, that's a classic mourning sign...\n\nYou don't have to go up there. But you basically told her you weren't throwing a thanksgiving dinner. She offered to come to you. You chose to dismiss her.\n\nFrom your other comments I think you're just mad she moved away and is, as you put it, moving on with her life, and you're punishing her, even if uncounsciously.", "Since the original post seems like you do have a relationship with her, I\u2019d honestly invite her and ask for her help cooking if she\u2019s super particular about the menu. \n\nI DO have sympathy for your situation of the whole traditional menu thing and doing it alone. Older folks can certainly be particular about that stuff but it\u2019s hard to do it all single-handedly.\n\nMaybe a compromise is ordering some stuff pre-prepped if the actual food is such a huge issue.", "Yes, thank you! I will edit my post to add that I talked to her today after reading the responses, and she told me she's going to my aunt's (her oldest sister, she's one of 5 kids) for thanksgiving. I think some of this is communication issues too, she's less direct than I am sometimes, and can be passive aggressive/guilt trippy if it isn't what she wants.", "I don't feel I'm punishing her for moving, but I do think it's unfair for her to choose to move further away, and then demand that I travel up to see her. I do acknowledge some hurt feelings, definitely.", "I did not. She said she wasn't coming if I wasn't doing the full traditional meal. I did not decline.", "I'm not pissed at her, just trying to figure out the \"right\" thing to do. There is no easy answer. She doesn't want to just come visit if I'm not willing to do a traditional sit down at a specific time dinner, which I don't want to do. Would I regret it, maybe? We had my dad's last thanksgiving in the rehab center while he was mad, confused about why he couldn't go home, and was frustrated and hateful about it. I'm not sure that it wouldn't have been better to just pretend to him that it was just any other day so he wouldn't have been so upset.", "Thank you for your thoughtfulness. My family here over the last few years has dwindled to just my mom & dad, me, my kid...and then I married a guy with 3 kids with different families when they were all teenagers. We always went to my mom & dad's, and then last year, just my mom's. She doesn't want to come here if it isn't all the traditional sit down at a specific time kind of deal, while I want something less stressful for all of us. I did make sure she understood she was invited, as I didn't want her to feel like she wasn't, even if that wasn't my intent. She can be very odd about such things, my husband and I were going to elope to Vegas, I told her she'd be welcome, but don't feel obligated to go, and she still tells that I \"didn't want her there\".", "If she doesnt want to that shit she doesnt need to do it, that doesnt make her an ah.", "All boys, 28 (mine, autistic), two who will be 25 in December (one with a SO he's fixing to propose to that I know they are going to eat at her parents), and one who is 18. And that's kind of what I was proposing, easy to keep warm something, boys show up whenever you can.", "I'm honestly not mad she's moving on, I am happy for her. I advised her years ago to leave him since she wasn't happy, and she is now getting to do the things she never could. I am a bit hurt she moved so far away, I admit that. And I agree that she could be doing her mourning that way, but she says she's ok, so not sure how to \"know\". I really don't see that I dismissed her though, honestly. She asked, I replied in the moment with my just thought up thoughts. She said she didn't want to come down if I didn't want to do the full traditional.", "But elaborate if not the case - but she didnt demand, she asked/invited you and then said she\u2019d travel to you. So there\u2019s a big disconnect here", "I apologize. You\u2019re not being an asshole. It appears you are trying to be flexible. Your Mom is just being a stick in the mud. My husband\u2019s Mom was like that. Her way or make everyone feel badly because she is \u201cnot wanted\u201d. We had 4 kids under 4 so I honestly couldn\u2019t imagine accommodating her even if I wanted to. We weren\u2019t dragging a 4,2 & twin infants anywhere for anything. I was lucky if I showered everyday. Just facts. Either come to our house or don\u2019t. My family has always been super flexible so we just choose not make life harder for each other. \n\nYou have 4 kids. It makes sense to stay home. If she chooses not to come that\u2019s okay. She will be fine & you will still love her & she will still love you.", "Then you could just decide to cook the traditional dinner. Ask her to help you make it and make it into something you can do together.", "I tried to condense but the actual conversations were:\n\nMom- What are you thinking about doing for Tgiving?\n\nMe - Hadn't really thought about it yet. Not sure what plans the kids have yet. If I do anything I'll probably do something easy and they can drop by when they have time.\n\nMom- Well, I wouldn't come down if you aren't going to do the traditional sit-down dinner. \n\nThen a later conversation had the passive aggressive \"So if I cooked up here, I'd just be here alone\" comment. So your idea that she invited then told me she'd come here is an incorrect assumption.", "Thank you. I do feel I am trying to be flexible, but honest that I'm not up to cooking the whole meal, or trying to manage everyone's schedules. And I don't think she's being an AH either, just has a specific vision of how she wants things to be. We could manage all the balancing when we lived in the same area, but with her moving it has complicated things.", "Im still not seeing her demanding you visit. Could she actually be more direct, yes. \n\nEither way we have one person giving options and another shooting them all down.", "My husband & I say every year after the holidays \u2026 let\u2019s just go away next year. Lol \u2026 we love our family but we definitely need to make that plan happen! \n\nWishing you a very Happy Thanksgiving!", "She's not direct at all, usually ever. Maybe her generation, maybe her personality as a middle kid, not sure. I don't see me shooting down options, she could come here. She doesn't want to if I don't want to do things her way.", "Okay im done after this because I dont think you\u2019re willing to understand other perspectives here but I just have to say \n\n>She doesn\u2019t want to if I don\u2019t want to do things her way \n\nSorry but you\u2019re \u201cinvite\u201d for thanksgiving was haphazard and youre not even doing thanksgiving. I too would not go somewhere for thanksgiving dinner if the host was like, meh\u2026 ill make a stew and leave it on the stove.
