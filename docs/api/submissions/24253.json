Of course you don't leave someone recobvering from surgery alone.  I would not have even asked, I would have told him, when he got back, that your mom was coming to stay for a week.  \n\n\nThe fact that he is angry at your reaction and not horrified at what his poor judgement resulted in is a huge red flag.  Maybe he is just immature, but that degree of self centeredness is concerning\n\nNTA, but you need to consider if there are other warning signs re: your BF that should concern you.  26 is young, but not young enough to excuse his behavior", "NTA. Your boyfriend just failed a basic partnership test. I'd break up and tell him to go stay with a friend. If he gets snitty, download a thirty day notice to vacate form and give it to him so it's a legal eviction.", "NTA - You made arrangements for someone to care for you. He didn't like those arrangements and said he would take off work to care for you. Taking care of you doesn't mean that he's gone for 6+ hours or even 2.5 + hours. It's one thing if he has to run to the store because you guys need something. He abandoned you to go out with friends less than a week after you had surgery and there's no excuse for that. He is either going to be there to take care of you as he should, or like you said your mother needs to come over to do it.", "NTA. Not only did he abandon you when you needed his help, it is a red flag to refuse to allow your mother to come round to help you. A true partner would allow you all the help you can get. 'Makes him uncomfortable' - oh i'm sure he is perfectly capable to swallow his uncomfortableness if its to help you out. If he can't, he is a lousy bf.", "Call your mom. NOW. Ask her if she\u2019s still able to come help you out. TELL your bf that his inability to care for you when you medically require it has forced the change and he can basically suck it up. \n\nNTA. \n\nUsually, I\u2019m all for the \u201ctwo yeses\u201d approach. But your bf failed to follow through and was incredibly selfish in his neglect. Sure you want to keep him around? He\u2019s shown you who he is.", "NTA.\nAt this point, you need reliable help.  Your boyfriend has shown he will not do what he said he would do when it really matters, when you are counting on him.", "OP NTA. If I was in that situation, I would kick my bf out of the house.

This is basic partnership duties and he cant even bother to be there to help you pee", "NTA.  You offered a great compromise.

He never intended to actually assist you, he just didn't want your mother in the house. \n\nI wouldn't even give him an ultimatum. He had his chance, you considered his feelings and went with his idea, he completely broke his word and neglected you when you needed help for medical reasons. Call your mother, ask her to come over.

Hopefully he does, you deserve a better man and not some kid wanting to go out and play. Your NTA for being pissed. Invite your mom back.", "NTA Nipping out to run an errand or go to the store is one thing, taking off for six hours to go to the movies and out to lunch with friends without so much as a word to you is an entirely different matter. If that's your boyfriend's idea of \"taking care\" of you after surgery, call your mother and let him sulk.", "NTA - if he doesn't like ultimatums, reframe the question. Someone needs to help you piss, and sometimes clean up piss. Either he does it or your mum does it. His choice.\n\n\nAlso these are all red flags. Consider breaking up.", "NTA ties 1000... Your boyfriend doesn't care about taking care of you.  He will do something if you ask and if he doesn't have something better to do.\n\nCall your mom and tell her you need her help.  Tell your boyfriend your mom is coming to help because you left for 6+ instead of sticking around to help.  So you were not thinking about me, but yourself.\n\nWhen two single people start dating, they prioritize themselves first.  as the relationship deepens, they start to prioritize their SO over themselves.  the relationship is a spectrum from two single people dating to a married couple where you have formally committed to each other for life.  In the middle of that spectrum is where you go from being two single people to being half of a couple.  When you are half of a couple, each person is thinking about how to make the other's life better because you view yourself as half of a couple.  It means when you are sick, he asks how he can help.  He wants to take care of you despite his friends asking him to come out and play.  someone who views themselves as half of a couple, would say, sorry guys, I can't, I need to take care of my other half.  Or he would ask you, hey are you going to be ok for a couple of hours so I can go have lunch with the guys?  what can i get you so that you will be good for a couple of hours?\n\nYour boyfriend didn't care about your needs.  he didn't think about what would happen to you if he was gone for that long.  he cared more about hanging out with his friends.  he didn't want your mom staying because that would show that he couldn't care for you.  but he only wanted to care for you when it didn't affect him.  That's someone who prioritizes himself first.  \n\nI would suggest you need to rethink living together because he puts himself first when you are hurting.  is that someone you want to have as a partner??  when you are at your most vulnerable, he is clueless or doesn't care.  you deserve better.  It is worth an honest conversation with him over him promising to take care of you after surgery with severe mobility issues and he takes off for 6+ hours to hang out with the guys.  That is someone who is not your other half.  what does he think he did wrong?  Does he see why this is wrong?  This isn't a simple oops.  He put his own desires first over your needs.  He didn't need to go, he wanted to go.  You needed him to stay.  his desires are more important to him than your needs.  You deserve better.  You deserve someone who WANTS to be there for you.  You deserve someone who puts your needs before their own desires.", "NTA. I wish you changed the question too. That isn't how it happened. He told you not to have your mom help because he had time and would help you. \n\nYour boyfriend is an AH and I would break up with him over this. It sounds like it was a serious surgery with a dreadful recovery. Instead of being at your service to help, he decided to f off to a movies and lunch and didn't even tell you where he was. When someone needs support to the extent you did, you literally don't leave the house except maybe to walk the dog or do a grocery run. He doesn't care about you and helping you recover. He's selfish. \n\nHe's also pissed that you gave him the choice again and he doesn't want your mom around but also doesn't want to commit to helping you. This guy is literally giving you ALL the info you need about him as a partner and what the future looks like. If you want kids, you can bet your ass he's out with friends after you come home from the hospital. Need help with kids? He disappears for a few hours. \n\nDon't be with someone like this. It's sad you even had to ask this question thinking you might not be having the right perspective and that he could possibly be right. Hell no! You gave him a chance to be off the hook and let your mom do everything and he said no. Then after he failed to help and you offered to let him off again, he got pissed. Dump him. You deserve better.", "NTA, sounds like he has an issue with your mother and if that's the case he needs to put that aside. He can't just leave for half a day and expect you won't need any help.", "NTA. Leaving someone who is practically immobile, whom you agreed to care for,  for 6 hours without even telling them in advance is a huge AH move. Maybe he was just thoughtless but when called on it, he should have been apologetic and agreed to do / be better, and instead he got mad. People who just get indignant when clearly wrong are annoying AF. What does he expect exactly? You should just piss your pants and not eat for half a day while he decides to randomly go socialize?\n\nI would only add that I can understand why he didn't want your mother living there, depending of course on their relationship and the space you have available, and that maybe after 3 days of continuous care he was burned out and thought he was taking a harmless break. But it's fair for you to be annoyed at this and to expect at least a different approach from him.", "Nta BF didn't want your mom there while he had time off.  It had nothing to do with taking care of you.  He just didn't want her to bother him and spoil his fun. Call.mom and tell.him to shove it if he objects.  He is an irresponsible liar and a huge ahole.  Why do young women keep putting up with these irresponsible jerks.  Says a lot about you both.", "NTA. This guy is not a good partner. Call your mom. Dump the boy. Good luck with your recovery.", "Very much NTA. \nAfter our youngest daughter was born I had a very high temperature and was quite sick and I really needed my husband to help me out, I don\u2019t get sick very often and this was probably only the second time I was sick in the 6 years we had been married. Anyway it was just a couple of days after Christmas and he had been drinking with his dad and when I asked him to please change the baby and bring her to me while I was in bed he said he didn\u2019t think he should because he was afraid he\u2019d drop her so up I got with very high temperature and looked after the baby. The next day I told him that whenever he\u2019s sick I look after him doing whatever needs to be done and that I was very disappointed him for the way he disregarded the fact that I was so very sick and seen only to what he wanted then told him that if it ever happened again he could die in the bed before I did anything for him again. As I said I don\u2019t get sick very often so the next time I needed him was 9 years later and I\u2019d had surgery luckily for me he wasn\u2019t working at the time and he was there for me 100% doing whatever he could for me, if he had been working I wouldn\u2019t expect him to take the time off to look after me just as when he\u2019s sick I don\u2019t take time off", "NTA\nJust have your mom come", "He sounds useless. NTA.", "Yeah, I'm gonna call my mom soon, I'm sure she'll still be happy to help. I just don't have the energy to have a big fight about it.", "They don't know each other well, which is why he was uncomfortable. I don't have a very big apartment either. \n\nI think 3 days is a bit soon to be burned out, but I'm not in that situation so idk. It's only bringing meals and helping me to the bathroom.", "Don't have a fight. You're recovering from surgery, if this guy not only is willing to leave you alone for hours to go have fun with his buddies, but also to have a big fight when you seek the help he won't provide, then that's your second red flag. \n\nDon't fight. Call your mother, and have her come over. Once she's there, inform him that after he neglected you and caused you to WET YOURSELF and be hungry for hours, you have decided to accept your mother's help, and she will be staying in YOUR HOME to help YOU. Since he mentioned he wouldn't be comfortable with that, it's best for him to find somewhere else to stay until you feel better. Ignore him after that. \n\nYou can have a conversation and see what to do about everything once you're recovered.", "Look, he gave you a gift.  He showed you how well he can care for you (not too well) and how he reacts when you need to talk about serious issues in your relationship (also not too well).", "He doesn\u2019t care about you. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out this way.", "NTA. Invite your mom back and boot your bf out - permanently. \n\nYour one mistake was in cleaning up your accident.

But I don't think he's prepared to take care of someone like that.", "Depends onthe type of surgery. Could be anything from wart removal to a hip replacement. Specifics are required on whether the bf was required to be at home with u to support or whether u wer jus looking for sympathy", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't wish surgery or illness on anyone EVER, but there is one positive side effect: it is a rigorous test of your partnership. \n\nIf youre the one who is down, you learn whether your partner will be there for you, be patient and considerate, will help advocate for you and help keep your spirits up.\n\nIf your partner is the one who is down, you learn whether they will retain their sense of humor,, accept your help, do what they can to help themselves but ask nicely for what they need, and appreciate your effort on their behalf.\n\nI wish my husband and I never had to go through this test- in both directions- but our relationship is that much stronger for it.\n\nYou deserve so much better. I hope you get well soon.", "NTA, unless this isn't nearly as debilitating as it is portrayed. Three days after surgery and OP can't even make it to the kitchen in a small apartment?  Typically, a US hospital has patients walking the halls in 24 hours even after something serious.  But in any case, he is an AH for vanishing for 6 hours without letting you know, but in this day and age everyone expects to have a text returned in two minutes so unless he turned his phone off he may have felt like he was available in an emergency.", "NTA.

Break up with him and kick him to the curb.", "One of the many ways to know if your partner is for you is how tenderly they take care of you when you are ill or have surgeries.  My husband of 33 years had been 110% there for me.", "NTA. As someone who has both provided care for a partner after a major surgery and received care after a surgery of my own, this behavior is unacceptable.\n\nIf he had been running to the store (quick trip) to pick up something important and sought to do it while you were asleep and this happened, that would be unfortunate but understandable.  6 hours gone to watch a movie and go to lunch?  That\u2019s ridiculous and shows what his level of care is.  Even worse since he specifically had you not get your mom\u2019s support on his promise.  Apparently that promise isn\u2019t worth much.  I\u2019d be untrusting of other promises a person who does that makes.", "NTA\n\nHe wanted a vacation and used you as an excuse.", "NTA. As a nurse this makes me so upset. There are reasons we want a solid post-surgical caregiver plan in place before we discharge patients. There are multiple factors like pain, pain meds, and limited mobility that can make your normal activities of daily living a challenge in the few days following surgery, not to mention the slight but very real risk of post-op complications which make being alone dangerous. That was so unsafe for you and I\u2019m sorry that happened. At best your boyfriend is just too immature to get why this is a problem. But the fact that he actively did not want your mom to help, dropped the ball, and then was upset at you for stating a very reasonable ultimatum adds up to a big red flag for me.", "Having had more surgeries than the average bear I have questions.  How long after surgery was this?  How long was your mom going to stay?  Are you getting up and around as often as the doctors recommend?\n\nThe thing is, you do need help after a surgery.  You need someone who will make sure you are fed, that you are taking your meds, and that you're doing all of the things the doctors say you should do.  Does that mean the person helping needs to be there 24/7?  Of course not.  \n\nHow much he needs to help you and how much you need to help yourself will depend entirely on what the surgery was and how long ago you had it.\n\nI'm going to say that your boyfriend's expectations and your expectations have not been aligned.  I suspect reasonable expectations are somewhere in between.\n\nNAH", "NTA, what exactly is he pissed about? The fact that you expect him to do the thing he said he would do? It sounds like he just said whatever he had to in the moment to stop your mom from coming.", "If I learned my partner couldn\u2019t get to the bathroom in time because I wasn\u2019t there, that would be a wake up call to me that I wasn\u2019t doing what I should.

When you\u2019re in a relationship, it\u2019s a common curtesy to keep each other up to date with each other\u2019s movements.

He fucked up, he's still fucking up, and it's a big ol peek into their future.", "OP had her mother willing to take care of her. The guy opposed to have the MIL come and told OP he would take care of her instead. Then after two days and knowing OP is still early in her recovery process and requires assistance EVEN TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, he left her alone FOR HOURS without even informing her he would be out or where he'd be, WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING ON HER, and without CALLING HER MOTHER OR ANYONE ELSE TO COME STAY WITH HER. \n\nBecause of his actions, a recovering OP WET HERSELF AND HAD TO CLEAN UP AFTER HERSELF, AND SPENT HOURS WITHOUT NOURISHMENT. \n\nAnd where was the guy? AT THE MOVIES AND THEN EATING OUT WITH FRIENDS. \n\nThis isn't an \"he messed up\" case. This is the reddest of flags and he absolutely deserves to be dumped over it. You don't neglect your partner when they're literally dependant on you for their primary needs such as eating and using the toilet. You just don't.", "I didn't, I had a snickers in my purse lol. But yeah he hasn't been great.", "Your boyfriend can\u2019t suck it up and have your mom stay in your house for a few days?! Trust me unless your mom is a raging asshole he should be able to handle it. When you are out of this pain you need to think about this man and if he is the right one for you.", "Yeah definitely NTA. And being burned out after 3 days doesn't seem plausible. \n\nI had a very small procedure 2 weeks ago and was a bit sore for a week. But I could get myself to the bathroom, and for the most part could get around (just a little slower and it hurt). And my bf went above and beyond to look after me wherever he could. Any time I tried to do something myself and made any sign of being in pain he would huff and tell me to stay where I am, what do I need/want. I can't imagine him being anything less than a home nurse if it were anything like what you're dealing with (he would probably even get an outfit if he thought it would make me smile)\n\nSomeone who loves you and sees you in that state should want to do everything they can to look after you. And regardless of his intention when he left and you were asleep, finding out what you went through when he was gone should horrify him. He should be apologising and be understanding in your disappointment and hurt, not digging his heels in and being mad.", "I don't disagree with that. But what I'm saying is that I don't think what he did damns him to be irredeemable.\n\n~~It's not about ultimatums, it's about getting him to properly care for you, or admit that's he's not fit to do it at this given time.~~ At one point, he should be able to.\n\nOr that you have to properly communicate why him going to the movies was not correct, that's really what matters. So, yeah.", "Bf moved in with OP, though. It\u2019s better to get him out now so it\u2019s easier to kick him out later.", "So one mistake defines who you are?  Maybe look at he did take his vacation or sick time to help in which he was helping.  Yall be telling people to break up when that's not even what they asking for.  They asked are they the ah for being upset and the answer is a huge no because he messed up.  And by you mindset she's injury prone and he should watch out because he will have to be taking care of her.  He messed up one time she had surgery one time does that make either a pattern?", "Oh okay - then yes, mom should come over and kick out the bf", "He left her alone to piss herself and did not even tell her why. He was gone for six hours. He didn't even seem to check in on her. \n\nIt's \"one mistake,\" but one that tells you everything you need to know about his priorities. It's not like he couldn't pick up her meds because the pharmacy has new hours that he didn't know about.", "There are many mistakes that only one of them defines, if not your life, the course of it. Cheating once is enough to end your marriage. Saying something horrible to your child once is enough to change the way they see you and your relationship with them forever. \n\nBailing on your convalescent, bedridden girlfriend who had someone else to take care of her but rejected them because you asked her to and promised to care of her, to go have fun with your buddies, and causing her to be hungry and dirty for hours, is one of those.", "not only that but he got annoyed that she got annoyed about it. what if she'd fallen and seriously hurt herself? we don't know what the surgery was but can assume if she needs assistance in any sort of moving around that a) she's probably fairly heavily medicated and b) she most likely has stitches that can be ripped if she moves around too much. if you say you're going to care for someone after a major surgery, you do it. if you don't want to sit and stare at the wall while they're sleeping, you ask about inviting someone over to keep you company. if you want out of the house, you get someone to stay while you're gone. you don't just disappear and assume everything will be fine. if he's not able to understand that, or to see that he did fuck up and apologize profusely and accept that OP's frustration is fair and valid FOR BEING LEFT ALONE AFTER A SURGERY AND PISSING HERSELF BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T GET TO THE BATHROOM it's pretty clear that this isn't a one time attitude he's pulling."]}
