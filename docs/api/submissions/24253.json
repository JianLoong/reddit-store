He said he didn't want your mom to help and volunteered to help you and instead prioritized himself and ignored your situation. He shouldn't have left all all when you needed his support.

He literally made you rely on him and not your mum, and then bailed to see friends. Rubbish", "NTA. You have now seen what kind of partner he is when you need help. Proceed accordingly.", "NTA\n\nThis is negligence and AH behaviour on his part. Does he seriously care so little for you that he leaves you for 6hrs after surgery???\n\nMy wife was the same state as you and I felt guilty leaving her sleeping at home alone for 30mins to get groceries! 6hrs?? \n\nHe has no right being passed, he should have invited your mum over himself to work out a schedule with her!", "Hell no NTA. If it were me (and it wasn't carpet), I would've left the piss on the floor.", "NTA. Taking care of your partner during times like this should be expected, unless there is something he really can't get out of. Especially since he offered and you gave up your mother's help. I would seriously consider the future of your relationship. Will this man share the responsibility of a child, in case you want to have one? What if you get a long term illness someday, will he be there for you for months or years, if three days is now too much?", "NTA. He used the timeframe in which you fell asleep to sneak out, so you couldn't say no. It is unacceptable to disappear for 6+ hours, even if you hadn't just had surgery, let alone when you did.", "NTA. Call your mom, your boyfriend can crash with his movie friends if he has a problem. When you are recovered you can reassess this relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course you don't leave someone recobvering from surgery alone.  I would not have even asked, I would have told him, when he got back, that your mom was coming to stay for a week.  \n\n\nThe fact that he is angry at your reaction and not horrified at what his poor judgement resulted in is a huge red flag.  Maybe he is just immature, but that degree of self centeredness is concerning\n\nNTA, but you need to consider if there are other warning signs re: your BF that should concern you.  26 is young, but not young enough to excuse his behavior", "NTA. Your boyfriend just failed a basic partnership test. I'd break up and tell him to go stay with a friend. If he gets snitty, download a thirty day notice to vacate form and give it to him so it's a legal eviction.", "NTA - You made arrangements for someone to care for you. He didn't like those arrangements and said he would take off work to care for you. Taking care of you doesn't mean that he's gone for 6+ hours or even 2.5 + hours. It's one thing if he has to run to the store because you guys need something. He abandoned you to go out with friends less than a week after you had surgery and there's no excuse for that. He is either going to be there to take care of you as he should, or like you said your mother needs to come over to do it.", "NTA. Not only did he abandon you when you needed his help, it is a red flag to refuse to allow your mother to come round to help you. A true partner would allow you all the help you can get. 'Makes him uncomfortable' - oh i'm sure he is perfectly capable to swallow his uncomfortableness if its to help you out. If he can't, he is a lousy bf.", "Call your mom. NOW. Ask her if she\u2019s still able to come help you out. TELL your bf that his inability to care for you when you medically require it has forced the change and he can basically suck it up. \n\nNTA. \n\nUsually, I\u2019m all for the \u201ctwo yeses\u201d approach. But your bf failed to follow through and was incredibly selfish in his neglect. Sure you want to keep him around? He\u2019s shown you who he is.", "NTA.\nAt this point, you need reliable help.  Your boyfriend has shown he will not do what he said he would do when it really matters, when you are counting on him.", "OP NTA. If I was in that situation, I would kick my bf out of the house. He only wants to take care of you when he has nothing else to do. You need to ask your mother to come over to help you and tell your bf to \"s\\*\\*ck it up, buttercup\". \n\nI had foot surgery on both feet at one time. Thankfully, my then bf now husband said he would stay with me to help me for a few weeks. He was there for me whenever I needed him, and also to admonish me for not follow the surgeon's post care orders to a T.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly idk if hes the one. This is basic partnership duties and he cant even bother to be there to help you pee", "NTA.  You offered a great compromise.  Have your mom come over for a few hours to help out and he can go pound sand.", "NTA having someone there is a medical necessity not you needing attention. Call Mom and get her over stat and trade in the bf for someone who cares about you.", "NTA - You didn't give him an ultimatum. You gave him options.", "NTA he is a massiv jerk tho, this would be a deal-breaker for me.\nShow that he is not to be trusted.", "NTA. He never intended to actually assist you, he just didn't want your mother in the house. \n\nI wouldn't even give him an ultimatum. He had his chance, you considered his feelings and went with his idea, he completely broke his word and neglected you when you needed help for medical reasons. Call your mother, ask her to come over. Tell your boyfriend he can stay with his friends until you're recovered. \n\nAnd I would seriously consider allowing him to come back at all.", "You shouldn\u2019t of had him move in. He sounds like a jerk- and- he\u2019s proving it with his actions. Have your mother come stay with you and if he doesn\u2019t like it\u2026 he can move out! Hopefully he does, you deserve a better man and not some kid wanting to go out and play. Your NTA for being pissed. Invite your mom back.", "NTA Nipping out to run an errand or go to the store is one thing, taking off for six hours to go to the movies and out to lunch with friends without so much as a word to you is an entirely different matter. If that's your boyfriend's idea of \"taking care\" of you after surgery, call your mother and let him sulk.", "NTA - if he doesn't like ultimatums, reframe the question. Someone needs to help you piss, and sometimes clean up piss. Either he does it or your mum does it. His choice.\n\n\nAlso these are all red flags. Consider breaking up.", "NTA ties 1000... Your boyfriend doesn't care about taking care of you.  He will do something if you ask and if he doesn't have something better to do.\n\nCall your mom and tell her you need her help.  Tell your boyfriend your mom is coming to help because you left for 6+ instead of sticking around to help.  So you were not thinking about me, but yourself.\n\nWhen two single people start dating, they prioritize themselves first.  as the relationship deepens, they start to prioritize their SO over themselves.  the relationship is a spectrum from two single people dating to a married couple where you have formally committed to each other for life.  In the middle of that spectrum is where you go from being two single people to being half of a couple.  When you are half of a couple, each person is thinking about how to make the other's life better because you view yourself as half of a couple.  It means when you are sick, he asks how he can help.  He wants to take care of you despite his friends asking him to come out and play.  someone who views themselves as half of a couple, would say, sorry guys, I can't, I need to take care of my other half.  Or he would ask you, hey are you going to be ok for a couple of hours so I can go have lunch with the guys?  what can i get you so that you will be good for a couple of hours?\n\nYour boyfriend didn't care about your needs.  he didn't think about what would happen to you if he was gone for that long.  he cared more about hanging out with his friends.  he didn't want your mom staying because that would show that he couldn't care for you.  but he only wanted to care for you when it didn't affect him.  That's someone who prioritizes himself first.  \n\nI would suggest you need to rethink living together because he puts himself first when you are hurting.  is that someone you want to have as a partner??  when you are at your most vulnerable, he is clueless or doesn't care.  you deserve better.  It is worth an honest conversation with him over him promising to take care of you after surgery with severe mobility issues and he takes off for 6+ hours to hang out with the guys.  That is someone who is not your other half.  what does he think he did wrong?  Does he see why this is wrong?  This isn't a simple oops.  He put his own desires first over your needs.  He didn't need to go, he wanted to go.  You needed him to stay.  his desires are more important to him than your needs.  You deserve better.  You deserve someone who WANTS to be there for you.  You deserve someone who puts your needs before their own desires.", "NTA. I wish you changed the question too. That isn't how it happened. He told you not to have your mom help because he had time and would help you. \n\nYour boyfriend is an AH and I would break up with him over this. It sounds like it was a serious surgery with a dreadful recovery. Instead of being at your service to help, he decided to f off to a movies and lunch and didn't even tell you where he was. When someone needs support to the extent you did, you literally don't leave the house except maybe to walk the dog or do a grocery run. He doesn't care about you and helping you recover. He's selfish. \n\nHe's also pissed that you gave him the choice again and he doesn't want your mom around but also doesn't want to commit to helping you. This guy is literally giving you ALL the info you need about him as a partner and what the future looks like. If you want kids, you can bet your ass he's out with friends after you come home from the hospital. Need help with kids? He disappears for a few hours. \n\nDon't be with someone like this. It's sad you even had to ask this question thinking you might not be having the right perspective and that he could possibly be right. Hell no! You gave him a chance to be off the hook and let your mom do everything and he said no. Then after he failed to help and you offered to let him off again, he got pissed. Dump him. You deserve better.", "NTA, sounds like he has an issue with your mother and if that's the case he needs to put that aside. He can't just leave for half a day and expect you won't need any help.", "NTA. Leaving someone who is practically immobile, whom you agreed to care for,  for 6 hours without even telling them in advance is a huge AH move. Maybe he was just thoughtless but when called on it, he should have been apologetic and agreed to do / be better, and instead he got mad. People who just get indignant when clearly wrong are annoying AF. What does he expect exactly? You should just piss your pants and not eat for half a day while he decides to randomly go socialize?\n\nI would only add that I can understand why he didn't want your mother living there, depending of course on their relationship and the space you have available, and that maybe after 3 days of continuous care he was burned out and thought he was taking a harmless break. But it's fair for you to be annoyed at this and to expect at least a different approach from him.", "Nta BF didn't want your mom there while he had time off.  It had nothing to do with taking care of you.  He just didn't want her to bother him and spoil his fun. Call.mom and tell.him to shove it if he objects.  He is an irresponsible liar and a huge ahole.  Why do young women keep putting up with these irresponsible jerks.  Says a lot about you both.", "NTA. This guy is not a good partner. Call your mom. Dump the boy. Good luck with your recovery.", "Very much NTA. \nAfter our youngest daughter was born I had a very high temperature and was quite sick and I really needed my husband to help me out, I don\u2019t get sick very often and this was probably only the second time I was sick in the 6 years we had been married. Anyway it was just a couple of days after Christmas and he had been drinking with his dad and when I asked him to please change the baby and bring her to me while I was in bed he said he didn\u2019t think he should because he was afraid he\u2019d drop her so up I got with very high temperature and looked after the baby. The next day I told him that whenever he\u2019s sick I look after him doing whatever needs to be done and that I was very disappointed him for the way he disregarded the fact that I was so very sick and seen only to what he wanted then told him that if it ever happened again he could die in the bed before I did anything for him again. As I said I don\u2019t get sick very often so the next time I needed him was 9 years later and I\u2019d had surgery luckily for me he wasn\u2019t working at the time and he was there for me 100% doing whatever he could for me, if he had been working I wouldn\u2019t expect him to take the time off to look after me just as when he\u2019s sick I don\u2019t take time off", "NTA\nJust have your mom come", "He sounds useless. NTA.", "Yeah, I'm gonna call my mom soon, I'm sure she'll still be happy to help. I just don't have the energy to have a big fight about it.", "They don't know each other well, which is why he was uncomfortable. I don't have a very big apartment either. \n\nI think 3 days is a bit soon to be burned out, but I'm not in that situation so idk. It's only bringing meals and helping me to the bathroom.", "Don't have a fight. You're recovering from surgery, if this guy not only is willing to leave you alone for hours to go have fun with his buddies, but also to have a big fight when you seek the help he won't provide, then that's your second red flag. \n\nDon't fight. Call your mother, and have her come over. Once she's there, inform him that after he neglected you and caused you to WET YOURSELF and be hungry for hours, you have decided to accept your mother's help, and she will be staying in YOUR HOME to help YOU. Since he mentioned he wouldn't be comfortable with that, it's best for him to find somewhere else to stay until you feel better. Ignore him after that. \n\nYou can have a conversation and see what to do about everything once you're recovered.", "Look, he gave you a gift.  He showed you how well he can care for you (not too well) and how he reacts when you need to talk about serious issues in your relationship (also not too well)."]}
