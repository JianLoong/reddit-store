Of course you don't leave someone recobvering from surgery alone.  I would not have even asked, I would have told him, when he got back, that your mom was coming to stay for a week.  \n\n\nThe fact that he is angry at your reaction and not horrified at what his poor judgement resulted in is a huge red flag.  Maybe he is just immature, but that degree of self centeredness is concerning\n\nNTA, but you need to consider if there are other warning signs re: your BF that should concern you.  26 is young, but not young enough to excuse his behavior", "NTA. Your boyfriend just failed a basic partnership test. I'd break up and tell him to go stay with a friend. If he gets snitty, download a thirty day notice to vacate form and give it to him so it's a legal eviction.", "NTA - You made arrangements for someone to care for you. He didn't like those arrangements and said he would take off work to care for you. Taking care of you doesn't mean that he's gone for 6+ hours or even 2.5 + hours. It's one thing if he has to run to the store because you guys need something. He abandoned you to go out with friends less than a week after you had surgery and there's no excuse for that. He is either going to be there to take care of you as he should, or like you said your mother needs to come over to do it.", "NTA. Not only did he abandon you when you needed his help, it is a red flag to refuse to allow your mother to come round to help you. A true partner would allow you all the help you can get. 'Makes him uncomfortable' - oh i'm sure he is perfectly capable to swallow his uncomfortableness if its to help you out. If he can't, he is a lousy bf.", "Call your mom. NOW. Ask her if she\u2019s still able to come help you out.

He never intended to actually assist you, he just didn't want your mother in the house. \n\nI wouldn't even give him an ultimatum.

Hopefully he does, you deserve a better man and not some kid wanting to go out and play. Your NTA for being pissed. Invite your mom back.", "NTA Nipping out to run an errand or go to the store is one thing, taking off for six hours to go to the movies and out to lunch with friends without so much as a word to you is an entirely different matter. If that's your boyfriend's idea of \"taking care\" of you after surgery, call your mother and let him sulk.", "NTA - if he doesn't like ultimatums, reframe the question. Someone needs to help you piss, and sometimes clean up piss. Either he does it or your mum does it. His choice.\n\n\nAlso these are all red flags. Consider breaking up.", "NTA ties 1000... Your boyfriend doesn't care about taking care of you.  He will do something if you ask and if he doesn't have something better to do.\n\nCall your mom and tell her you need her help.  Tell your boyfriend your mom is coming to help because you left for 6+ instead of sticking around to help.  So you were not thinking about me, but yourself.\n\nWhen two single people start dating, they prioritize themselves first.  as the relationship deepens, they start to prioritize their SO over themselves.  the relationship is a spectrum from two single people dating to a married couple where you have formally committed to each other for life.  In the middle of that spectrum is where you go from being two single people to being half of a couple.  When you are half of a couple, each person is thinking about how to make the other's life better because you view yourself as half of a couple.  It means when you are sick, he asks how he can help.  He wants to take care of you despite his friends asking him to come out and play.  someone who views themselves as half of a couple, would say, sorry guys, I can't, I need to take care of my other half.  Or he would ask you, hey are you going to be ok for a couple of hours so I can go have lunch with the guys?  what can i get you so that you will be good for a couple of hours?\n\nYour boyfriend didn't care about your needs.  he didn't think about what would happen to you if he was gone for that long.  he cared more about hanging out with his friends.  he didn't want your mom staying because that would show that he couldn't care for you.  but he only wanted to care for you when it didn't affect him.  That's someone who prioritizes himself first.  \n\nI would suggest you need to rethink living together because he puts himself first when you are hurting.  is that someone you want to have as a partner??  when you are at your most vulnerable, he is clueless or doesn't care.  you deserve better.  It is worth an honest conversation with him over him promising to take care of you after surgery with severe mobility issues and he takes off for 6+ hours to hang out with the guys.  That is someone who is not your other half.  what does he think he did wrong?  Does he see why this is wrong?  This isn't a simple oops.  He put his own desires first over your needs.  He didn't need to go, he wanted to go.  You needed him to stay.  his desires are more important to him than your needs.  You deserve better.  You deserve someone who WANTS to be there for you.  You deserve someone who puts your needs before their own desires.", "NTA. I wish you changed the question too. That isn't how it happened. He told you not to have your mom help because he had time and would help you. \n\nYour boyfriend is an AH and I would break up with him over this. It sounds like it was a serious surgery with a dreadful recovery. Instead of being at your service to help, he decided to f off to a movies and lunch and didn't even tell you where he was. When someone needs support to the extent you did, you literally don't leave the house except maybe to walk the dog or do a grocery run. He doesn't care about you and helping you recover. He's selfish. \n\nHe's also pissed that you gave him the choice again and he doesn't want your mom around but also doesn't want to commit to helping you. This guy is literally giving you ALL the info you need about him as a partner and what the future looks like. If you want kids, you can bet your ass he's out with friends after you come home from the hospital. Need help with kids? He disappears for a few hours. \n\nDon't be with someone like this. It's sad you even had to ask this question thinking you might not be having the right perspective and that he could possibly be right. Hell no! You gave him a chance to be off the hook and let your mom do everything and he said no. Then after he failed to help and you offered to let him off again, he got pissed. Dump him. You deserve better.", "NTA, sounds like he has an issue with your mother and if that's the case he needs to put that aside. He can't just leave for half a day and expect you won't need any help.", "NTA. Leaving someone who is practically immobile, whom you agreed to care for,  for 6 hours without even telling them in advance is a huge AH move. Maybe he was just thoughtless but when called on it, he should have been apologetic and agreed to do / be better, and instead he got mad. People who just get indignant when clearly wrong are annoying AF. What does he expect exactly? You should just piss your pants and not eat for half a day while he decides to randomly go socialize?\n\nI would only add that I can understand why he didn't want your mother living there, depending of course on their relationship and the space you have available, and that maybe after 3 days of continuous care he was burned out and thought he was taking a harmless break. But it's fair for you to be annoyed at this and to expect at least a different approach from him.", "Nta BF didn't want your mom there while he had time off.  It had nothing to do with taking care of you.  He just didn't want her to bother him and spoil his fun. Call.mom and tell.him to shove it if he objects.  He is an irresponsible liar and a huge ahole.  Why do young women keep putting up with these irresponsible jerks.  Says a lot about you both.", "NTA. This guy is not a good partner. Call your mom. Dump the boy. Good luck with your recovery.", "Very much NTA. \nAfter our youngest daughter was born I had a very high temperature and was quite sick and I really needed my husband to help me out, I don\u2019t get sick very often and this was probably only the second time I was sick in the 6 years we had been married. Anyway it was just a couple of days after Christmas and he had been drinking with his dad and when I asked him to please change the baby and bring her to me while I was in bed he said he didn\u2019t think he should because he was afraid he\u2019d drop her so up I got with very high temperature and looked after the baby. The next day I told him that whenever he\u2019s sick I look after him doing whatever needs to be done and that I was very disappointed him for the way he disregarded the fact that I was so very sick and seen only to what he wanted then told him that if it ever happened again he could die in the bed before I did anything for him again. As I said I don\u2019t get sick very often so the next time I needed him was 9 years later and I\u2019d had surgery luckily for me he wasn\u2019t working at the time and he was there for me 100% doing whatever he could for me, if he had been working I wouldn\u2019t expect him to take the time off to look after me just as when he\u2019s sick I don\u2019t take time off", "NTA\nJust have your mom come", "He sounds useless. NTA.", "Yeah, I'm gonna call my mom soon, I'm sure she'll still be happy to help.

I don't have a very big apartment either. \n\nI think 3 days is a bit soon to be burned out, but I'm not in that situation so idk. It's only bringing meals and helping me to the bathroom.", "Don't have a fight. You're recovering from surgery, if this guy not only is willing to leave you alone for hours to go have fun with his buddies, but also to have a big fight when you seek the help he won't provide, then that's your second red flag. \n\nDon't fight. Call your mother, and have her come over. Once she's there, inform him that after he neglected you and caused you to WET YOURSELF and be hungry for hours, you have decided to accept your mother's help, and she will be staying in YOUR HOME to help YOU. Since he mentioned he wouldn't be comfortable with that, it's best for him to find somewhere else to stay until you feel better. Ignore him after that. \n\nYou can have a conversation and see what to do about everything once you're recovered.", "Look, he gave you a gift.  He showed you how well he can care for you (not too well) and how he reacts when you need to talk about serious issues in your relationship (also not too well).", "He doesn\u2019t care about you. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out this way.", "NTA. Invite your mom back and boot your bf out - permanently. \n\nYour one mistake was in cleaning up your accident.

But I don't think he's prepared to take care of someone like that.", "Depends onthe type of surgery. Could be anything from wart removal to a hip replacement. Specifics are required on whether the bf was required to be at home with u to support or whether u wer jus looking for sympathy", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't wish surgery or illness on anyone EVER, but there is one positive side effect: it is a rigorous test of your partnership. \n\nIf youre the one who is down, you learn whether your partner will be there for you, be patient and considerate, will help advocate for you and help keep your spirits up.\n\nIf your partner is the one who is down, you learn whether they will retain their sense of humor,, accept your help, do what they can to help themselves but ask nicely for what they need, and appreciate your effort on their behalf.\n\nI wish my husband and I never had to go through this test- in both directions- but our relationship is that much stronger for it.\n\nYou deserve so much better. I hope you get well soon.", "NTA, unless this isn't nearly as debilitating as it is portrayed. Three days after surgery and OP can't even make it to the kitchen in a small apartment?  Typically, a US hospital has patients walking the halls in 24 hours even after something serious.  But in any case, he is an AH for vanishing for 6 hours without letting you know, but in this day and age everyone expects to have a text returned in two minutes so unless he turned his phone off he may have felt like he was available in an emergency.", "NTA.

That\u2019s ridiculous and shows what his level of care is.  Even worse since he specifically had you not get your mom\u2019s support on his promise.  Apparently that promise isn\u2019t worth much.  I\u2019d be untrusting of other promises a person who does that makes.", "NTA\n\nHe wanted a vacation and used you as an excuse.", "NTA. As a nurse this makes me so upset. There are reasons we want a solid post-surgical caregiver plan in place before we discharge patients. There are multiple factors like pain, pain meds, and limited mobility that can make your normal activities of daily living a challenge in the few days following surgery, not to mention the slight but very real risk of post-op complications which make being alone dangerous. That was so unsafe for you and I\u2019m sorry that happened. At best your boyfriend is just too immature to get why this is a problem. But the fact that he actively did not want your mom to help, dropped the ball, and then was upset at you for stating a very reasonable ultimatum adds up to a big red flag for me.", "Having had more surgeries than the average bear I have questions.  How long after surgery was this?  How long was your mom going to stay?  Are you getting up and around as often as the doctors recommend?\n\nThe thing is, you do need help after a surgery.  You need someone who will make sure you are fed, that you are taking your meds, and that you're doing all of the things the doctors say you should do.  Does that mean the person helping needs to be there 24/7?  Of course not.  \n\nHow much he needs to help you and how much you need to help yourself will depend entirely on what the surgery was and how long ago you had it.\n\nI'm going to say that your boyfriend's expectations and your expectations have not been aligned.  I suspect reasonable expectations are somewhere in between.\n\nNAH", "NTA, what exactly is he pissed about? The fact that you expect him to do the thing he said he would do?

WTF!!!\n\nBTW - I think I fell a little bit in love with my BF during those three days, we were inseparable after that and have been married for 38 years.", "What was the surgery? Three days could be way too little time to leave you, or no big deal.", "NTA Baby. Your boyfriend is treating you like trash.

To the point that he is no longer my emergency contact, on anything. \n\nCall your mom and have her come.", "[removed]", "NTA. Your boyfriend was a real jerk for leaving you without a word like that, being gone so long and not even bringing you something to eat. His idea of \"care\" is BS.

He offered himself to do it, how can you manage his absence without even knowing he was going out, it was irresponsible! Like, honest mistakes can happen, it would be possible for him to think it was ok and turns out it wasn't, but he has to own his mistake and help you adjust how much you can rely on him and he ultimately does not have the right to be pissed off about it", "NTA call mom. he can live with it or got back with his friends but you've seen how reliable he is.", "You two should break up.\n\nNTA", "NTA - so now you know your boyfriend is useless when you need him.  Luckily he moved in with you so he can move right back out.", "NTA and I would not recommend marrying this guy! This is the tip of the iceberg. He thought since you were in a pain meds induced agony nap, he could fuck off for 6 hrs and play with his frens. He left you. You soiled, trying to hobble to the toilet, had to clean that in a bad state, and then you had to lie in bed hungry. And he thinks it\u2019s totally stupid that you\u2019re trying to compromise? He helps, or Mama helps, but either way\u2026 you require assistance during this process. Simple. Nothing mean. Nothing extraordinary.", "NTA. Honestly, this is such a betrayal that I'd absolutely be done with the relationship. He didn't HAVE to be your caretaker, but he rejected your alternative plans. Then literally left you alone in a very vulnerable state instead of... calling your mom for some babysitting duty?", "Definitely NTA - he said he'd take care of you and the first chance he got, he bailed on you.  You're right, he can't have it both ways.  If he can't take care of the woman he supposedly loves, then that's a huge red flag.", "NTA but your boyfriend is a huge asshole, please invite your mom without asking him again, when you need someone she will be there. Never trust a man who shows you in such an obvious way that you can't believe his words.", "NTA. He is a piece of work, though. As already mentioned, there are many red flags waving.\n\nMaybe, he is just not used to take care of someone like this and therefore has no idea what that means for him. You need to have a serious talk with him. Taking care of you must be his Nr. 1 priority right now. He has to check with you what you need. If he wants to go out, he needs to talk to you. If you are asleep, he has to either wake you up to ask or he has to wait until your sleep ends. After you wake up, you might have need for something, like needing to pee or other stuff.\n\nYou need rules for him. Right now, you need more help from him. So, if you agree that he goes out with friends, he needs to tell you, when he plans to be back. And if you need anything urgently, he has to be reachable.", "Is this legit a question? You cannot possibly think you're the AH in this. NTA", "it\u2019s not really an ultimatum, you\u2019re giving pretty reasonable options given his actions.

Throw this one back and go fishing for a new one when you are all healed up :)", "\"He didn't feel comfortable with my mom here\" I'm going to stop you right there, because I think that needs to be unpacked in and of itself. Oh and definitely NTA", "It sounds like you weren't on the same page as to what it means for him to stay home and take care of you. Talking through the assumptions will probably be more helpful for you than issuing an either-or ultimatum (which would get anyone's fur up)", "NTA. Tell him what you want and need. If he fails AGAIN, call your mother and F him for not wanting her around. \n\nHe was an AH but if he thought you would sleep the entire time, he needs to understand what you actually want. If you want him in the house the whole time, to not leave for more than XX minutes, whatever. He cannot support you if he isn't sure what you want/need.", "My roommate has had surgery twice since we've lived together. Both times I made myself available *and* her best friend spent days here so we could tag out. We communicated availability and if I had to go to work, she was there. That's how you do it. I don't even really like my roommate. This guy presumably claims to love you!", "NTA. He said he would take care of you. He did not. You gave him another chance: either actually stay and help or mom comes. \n\nWhy is he pissed off? You're the one who had to clean during your recovery because he wasn't home to help you get to the toilet in time.", "NTA\n\nThat's terrible. At least now you know this guy doesn't keep his promises and apparently doesn't care (literally too).", "NTA leave himmmm", "NTA. I am not trying to put you down but i question his feelings towards you, and encourage you to be honest with yourself of why you are with this person.\n\nWhy is he calling any type of shots? He\u2019s the one that moved in? Even if helping to pay with rent or anything, he came to your home? At the least there\u2019s a compromise of things when sharing a living space. Seems one sided. \n\nWhat\u2019s the issue with your mom wanting to help? Invades his privacy and affects his comfort. Ok, then expectation is he steps up and covers for what your mom was happy and free to do, and he turns down the offer on your behalf for his sake. \nSo his comfort of your mom not being in his personal space was prioritized over your comfort of literally needing help support and care while in post-surgery recovery. \n\nPlaying dumb for being gone 6 hours? You napped. It wasn\u2019t an actual 6-8 hr night of sleep to justify being gone that long. It\u2019s a nap. Even then, ok, no phone calls or texts to check in? Not even a text to you to see when you wake up like \u201chey i stepped out but text me when you\u2019re awake so i can rush back!\u201d Zero concern, then had excuses that is just bullshit. And that at a point he made the conscious decision that it was a good idea to watch a movie, an activity that is a chunky fixed time block, that also is tough to keep communication with phones. \n\nWhat happens if you wake up call and he\u2019s still at the movie? Sorry couldn\u2019t answer my phone, was at the movie! Or would he have walked out and rushed home? \n\nI wonder if it was reversed and you said that you thought it was fine bc they were sleeping, would he have freaked out that you should know better than to leave him for that long ?\n\nThis is someone that\u2019s supposed to be your partner (the degree of partnership obviously varies on how serious relationship is) but considering they moved in, it should be serious enough to consider each other as life partners. \n\nYour partner knows you need constant care/support post-surgery, and makes a decision that suits HIS needs, not YOURS, by selecting to reject your moms proposal of care and that he can do it, only for the sake of his comfort, but also go about his recreational activities and not prioritizing you and your situation. You don\u2019t get the help you need, mom is prevented from helping you, and boyfriend is comfortable. That doesn\u2019t sound like a fun life. \n\nThen the gaslighting. Annoyed at you back. It\u2019s one thing to do ALL of this and apologize, still\nShitty. But to then take it another level and flip it back at you?? \n\nSorry but i am genuinely confused at why your boyfriend is annoyed about you being annoyed? Did you ask him why or what the reason is? Why\u2019s he annoyed that you needed him? Why\u2019s he annoyed that he broke his commitment to you, especially that he made you brush off more dependable and LOVING support? Does he understand what being a boyfriend is? Isn\u2019t he supposed to naturally want to be there for you out of emotion? \nIs he expecting you to be happy and thrilled he ditched you for 6 hours (full night of sleep BTW) bc you were napping? What\u2019s the right emotion so that HE doesn\u2019t get annoyed. Bc this is all about him. \n\nWhat happens down the road ? When mom is older and you don\u2019t even have an option of who can care for you besides your partner?", "NTA\n\nCall your mom. Have her help.

That's why he didn't want her there, so he could keep his ineptitude a secret.", "Absolutely NTA, but an important \"teaching / learning\" moment in your relationship.\n\nIf he owns up, apologises and improves - I'd say it's good.

He wouldn't be if he treated me the way your bf treated you.", "NTA, dump his stupid selfish ass.", "NTA. My brother did this to me once after I got my wisdom teeth removed. He said he'd watch me so my mom didn't have to take off work, but then disappeared for hours while I was starving and uncomfortably high off percocet.

Well he can move out.", "What a jackass, NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIf he had said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable being your caregiver and you had time to make other arrangements, that would be one thing. \n\nBut you HAD other arrangements and he didn\u2019t want that. He told you not to have your mom come. He said he would do it. \n\nIf he wanted to see a movie, he should have talked to you about it. After my Dad\u2019s knee surgery I stayed with him for 2 weeks.

Plus, a responsible caretaker would have made sure her needs were met first.
