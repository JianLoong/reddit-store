The story of the falling out is a long one I will try and explain it as short as possible: She has always been a parasite, she never finished school and has basically  been living of our entire family foralmost two decades at this point. \n\nShe decided to get pregnant with her first child at 22 and has birthed 6 children since, wich she does not take care off financially or emotionally. Me and my mother both live abroad and she has be causing the both of us but especially my mother heartache and financial problems. My mother was not yet able to tell her \"no\", she always helps her out of everything and funds her lazy life. She says she only does it because of my siters Children (her Grandchildren). \n\nI never really had a bond with my sister due to the age difference of 10 years and the fact that we moved abroad when I was 8 and my sister was 19 (btw. She did not want to come with us even thoughshe had tge chance to do so). \nI have grown increasingly estranged to her over the years, especially because of all the heartache she has been causing in my family due to her parasitic lifestyle and even coming to me for money when I was just 16 and working really hard as a student. She never even tried to work a day in her life. So at 24 I cut cords. My mother totally supports this and says as soon as the youngest child (8) is 18 she will do the same.\n\nNow to my main story: My oldest niece is now 16 and  even though she manly grew up with my aunt, she starting to become like her mother and constantly asks everyone around for money and is not pursuing any form of education. I don't want to fund her and made that clear. She keeps on texting me that she loves and misses me, I am afraid she is only saying so, so she can ask me for money. \n\nTo be honest I have only seen her in person 3 times since she was born, of course I love her deep down but due to her mother making my life so difficult and making it hard for me to form a bond with her since she was a child, I am not able to say that I miss her. \n\nMy mother says IATA for projecting the feelings towards my sister on to my niece. I don't see that tbh, I just never formed a bond to her and don't believe in saying I miss her back when I don't feel that.\n\nSo AITA for not saying \"I miss you too\" to my niece?\n\n(PS: Please exuse my English It is only my second language)", "created_utc": 1696785558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1734k9m/aita_for_not_telling_my_niece_that_i_miss_her_back/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is turning a blind eye by telling you you're projecting.   \nI doubt you love her deep down. You don't really care about her. You don't even miss her.", "NTA. She\u2019s basically a stranger and she\u2019s already started to ask you for money? Big nope.", "So you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re TA for not lying to her?\nYa I think we\u2019re know the answer when are simply being honest to a virtual stranger.", "NTA. You don\u2019t. So don\u2019t lie.", "I wouldn't be able to love them, either. I guess you're supposed to just automatically love family regardless of whether you know them, and maybe some people are able to do this. But a niece I'd met three times? I wouldn't love her or miss her.", "True. But OP did say sister does not care for kids emotionally. It\u2019s possible that niece just wants to be closer to other family members, and OP can always say no if she\u2019d asked for money. However after years of being manipulated by the sister I see how OP is wary.", "I absolutely get what you mean, but I honestly don't believe in telling her I miss ger when I just don't feel that way. What I mean by not pursuing any form of education is that she basically dropped out of school and is partying and staying at home all the time. She is being supported financially by my mother and aunt for everything she needs but asks everyone else for money so she can fund her lifestyle. She always lies about it and says it's for books and school and additional classes, but  we found out what it is actually for. Hope this brought a bit more context. :)", "NTA"]}
