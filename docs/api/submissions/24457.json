You don't need to apologize.", "NTA, but \u2026 she banned you from a party in your own home, and you were just like \u201cK. Latera.\u201d???", "NTA.  She definitely is.  Also it's weird you have to be confined to a room for her party.  Aren't you a couple?  Stand firm, she's totally wrong.", "NTA, your girlfriend sounds self-absorbed and disrespectful.

She doesn\u2019t help you clean the house in general.\n2. You paid for the drinks and snacks. \n3. You weren\u2019t invited to the party that you paid for.\n4. She wants you to \u201chelp\u201d her clean the house after not being invited.\n\nRegardless if you want to go to the party or not, it\u2019s rude that she blatantly ask you not to be there. And I purposely said \u201chelp\u201d sarcastically because you mentioned she doesn\u2019t help cleaning the house meaning she got little to no experience in cleaning for years. God knows how she cleans and you end up doing it for her because it wasn\u2019t properly done.\n\nI made a list bases on my understanding so I may pass it onto you as well. She basically treats you as her wallet and maid. Wake up. \n\nNTA, btw.", "NTA.
