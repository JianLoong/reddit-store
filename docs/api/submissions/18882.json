I'm with the other poster with cousins who have similar names.  It can get really stupid in ways you never expect.  Don't make things hard on your child before they're here. \n\n There are obviously other things going on in his family if you all didn't know she was pregnant and she blocked him so quickly.  It's not about the name.", "NTA, but as a person with a brother named David Michael born in July of \u201880 and a cousin named David Jonathan born in August of\u201980, I can say it was a very confusing childhood for them.

Not just because of her, but because now cousins are going to be hassled with \"who is who\" and other BS.  This name wasn't significant to you in any way in the first place.", "So its the same name, yours just has an \"s\" on the end?  I would be more bothered that my child wouldn't have their own unique name and be compared to the other kid. It's basically a copy of SIL's name.", "NTA.  The similar names may be confusing at family gatherings, but otherwise who cares what one chooses to name their child.  I've never understood the sense of complete ownership some have for names.  We have lots of Steves in our family.  So what?", "Girl name your baby what you want to name them . It\u2019s pronounced differently anyways . She sound crazy you know how common AMARI is my stepbrother name is amari lol . She better go play in some grass tf ( NTA )", "Where is this naming disease coming from? Everyone and their dog is doing this \"oh it's almost the same, oh it's the same, but I dreamt about this name on the bus the other day, oh gosh\"... Dear lord! I hate this...\n\nNo one owns a name or similar names, or whatever.\n\nNAH is my judgement. Call your child whatever you want, but don't get upset that she's upset. And good luck at family functions...", "NTA\n\nNo one owns the copyright to a child's name. Full stop.  \n\nIt is your and your boyfriend's decision. Since the cousin is a boy from his sister, they will not even have the same last name.  \n\nShe is probably upset, but this will hopefully pass.  How do people think they own a name? How do people think that a name can be stolen?", ">As soon as we found out it was a boy, when I was 10 weeks pregnant,\n\nI was under the impression that you can't tell gender until 14 weeks minimum. \n\nNTA  though, you have the right to name your baby what you like and  Amaris is a lovely name", " ESH this name has meaning to it and honors the memory of his friend. Besides Amaris and Amari is cute. However you knew they would be almost indentical names and you couldn\u2019t choose the friends middle name instead?", "Nta they arent even the same thing i met an amari before and like he went by a nickname", "I know several people with the same first name as their cousin, they usually have a different surname. It\u2019s no big deal, I don\u2019t know why so many here think it is. For most of their life they\u2019ll be an adult doing their own thing, not a kid mixing with other kids in the family. Call your child whatever you want to. NTA.", "NTA I once dated a guy who had a brother with the same first name. This isn't that uncommon", "I also forgot to add, his family all have similar names. Him and his brothers name rhyme. And his older sister and grandma have the same name just spelled differently.

I don\u2019t understand how it would sound similar.\n\nI think your SIL and others are making a bigger deal out of this than it is. It\u2019s a name. Two different families and two different children. NTA.", "Yes but you had time to change it", "I truthfully don't care what people chose to call him as long as it makes sense. I have two first names and I go by just one no one calls me my real name. Same with my bf. And when the kid gets older he can specify what he wants to be called.

The sister should have told everybody what her kid name was then it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue", "My daughter is \"lay-ah\" and she has a cousin \"lay-lah\". The family is fine. Grandma has the occasional slip of the lip but corrects herself immediately. The girls see each other probably every month. No-one is confused or upset.", "Ok then. Your SIL is just over sensitive and maybe insecure. So I would just let it go. If you want, argue that the name sound different and have different pronunciations. But, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to.", "Uh, Amaris is neither an Arabic word or name nor does it mean that.", "NTA. I am confused.

Bit extreme for the sister to go nuclear, but it sounds like there was more going on.\n\nEdit: correcting the autocorrect.", "Kind of YTA. It's basically the same name. \n\nPlease change the name and make those children's lives easier.", "Ummmmm you literally only added an S. I wouldn\u2019t say you are TA, but you kinda suck for that.

Probably not block you, but come on!", "Yta", "Nta lmao", "YTA. there\u2019s a million and one different names. amaris is not that special of a name to have it basically the same as his cousin. your son will probably hate correcting family members and it\u2019s all over your ego.", "YTA\n\nYou both knew for months how similar the names were. You could have talked privately to his sister prior to the announcement and explained what happened so she wouldn't be so shocked. Instead, you sat back and watched the explosion. You showed no consideration toward bf's sister. For that alone, you're both TA. \n\nThat being said - my daughter and her cousin have the same name. We just tag their middle names on when they're together and it helps with the confusion. There are ways to make this work, although I'm sure his sister would've been more willing to see it that way if you'd approached her respectfully in the first place.", "My dad and his cousin have the same name but there\u2019s so many of them (the cousins that is) it hasn\u2019t caused many issues lmfao. They both had their dad\u2019s names as middle names so they were referred to with both names. I also have a friend whose cousin\u2019s name rhymes with his (think Jayden and Aiden) and they didn\u2019t have too many issues other than some confusion. NAH probably, OP, since you chose it beforehand, but if your husband is concerned about it then I\u2019d discuss it with him first and come to an appropriate decision together.", "There's different variations depending on the language.

Either way I feel like she shouldn't have reacted so harshly when she kept it a secret and we had already planned on things.", "You said Arabic, hence my comment. That\u2019s not a word in Arabic, just so you know.", "It means that in Spanish. I'm not sure if you're aware of this but Spanish and Arabic are two different languages.", "They both start with \u201cAh-mar\u201d\u2026.", "I'm aware they are . I just misspoke.
