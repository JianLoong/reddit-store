Hide behind technicality if you want to, bottom line is, it\u2019s very similar and I can see why she would be upset. I already said her reaction was over the top. She doesn\u2019t have to tell you she\u2019s pregnant or what she plans to name her baby though, so why are you acting like this is her fault.

I'm just questioning why she is going to these lengths when neither of us knew the baby's name until it was born and had already chosen a name before she did. And now that his family does know the name we picked it's an issue. Especially when they are pronounced differently have different middle and last names. And the theme in their family is having similar or the same name just spelled differently.
