I used to live in this house with them 2020-2022 so I know the neighbour (f in 60s)they share a driveway with.\n\nSo my on my second day of cat sitting it was Mother's day and I had been out for a few appointments. As I reach the door there is a note wedged in the door frame. I open it and it says the neighbours daughter had sent a gift for Mother's day but neighbour is away. The note writer had come round to find it but they couldn't get past the gate and couldn't see it. They asked if I could keep an eye out for it and wrote \"at least you could eat them if you find them\". I walked down the drive and sure enough a gift bag was hanging from the locked gate. With flowers, a card and a box of four cupcakes. I brought them in, and took a picture of the note and gift and sent it to my friend who owns the house. She says lucky you. \nAt first I feel a bit weird and think oh I will leave them and then the next day I think, I don't know how long the neighbour is gone for, it would be bad if they go stale and go to waste and the note said to eat them so I ate them. \n\nThat week I am really busy with work and gym classes so I am leaving the house around 7am and not back until at least 8pm. When I do see that her car is back later that week it is at one of these awkward times.\n\nOn Saturday the neighbour comes by asking if I had seen the parcel her daughter had sent. I said yes, I have it and I show her the week old flowers, card and the note someone had left. She read it and said it was her sister in law. I mentioned that it was just the flowers and card as the cupcakes were now gone and gestured to the note saying to eat them.\n\nThe next evening the neighbour came round saying she wanted to clear the air. She then proceeded to tell me that she thought it was deplorable behaviour and it didn't sit right with her that I had eaten the cupcakes and she saw it as stealing. I should have text her and should have frozen the cupcakes so they would be saved for her. She said I should have called her sister in law who left the note, when I said I couldn't because I didn't have her number, she said it was on the note (I checked the picture I had of the note it wasn't). I said I did feel bad but the note had said to eat them and I had been very busy I hadn't been able to get down to her. She said that I could see when my car was there and I should have gone. She kept turning back that it was horrible behaviour, I was stealing and it crossed a line. I apologised profusely.\n\nAs soon as she left I burst into tears I felt so awful.\n\nI understand she is upset that she didn't get the full gift her daughter intended for her... but I feel like it was a bit harsh to say that I stole from her when I had written permission to eat the cupcakes.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684666848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nq0v3/aita_for_eating_the_neighbours_cupcakes/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s probably some sentiment attached. It\u2019s good that you apologized; sending some flowers with an apology note wouldn\u2019t be out of line either.", "NTA, the note was a clear permission to eat for the finder, and I have never ever in my life seen a cupcake in a freezer, nor expected any stranger to freeze food for me without request/instruction to do so.", "Well you are brave.

You the note said you could est them. The neighbour is the A h and her SIL for putting you in the position to be responsible for this gift.

Then you got too busy to follow up and the times were too awkward for you.  It would have been better just to leave them on the locked gate.  The cupcakes would have been inedible, but she would have gotten her other items more quickly.  \n\nDon't take someone else's items to 'help' if you're not going to be responsible for them.

The notes said you could eat them. Of course the neighbor is upset, because she feels something was taken from her. So guy buy her some replacement cupcakes. Everyone wins. You make amends and she gets fresh cupcakes instead of week old ones.", "NTA. The sender gave written permission. \n\nI can understand why the neighbour is upset tho. Still, it's not your fault. If the note had said to freeze/save the cupcakes until the neighbour got home and you ate them, it would be another story, but that's not what happened.
