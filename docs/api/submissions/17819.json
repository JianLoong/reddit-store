I used to live in this house with them 2020-2022 so I know the neighbour (f in 60s)they share a driveway with.\n\nSo my on my second day of cat sitting it was Mother's day and I had been out for a few appointments. As I reach the door there is a note wedged in the door frame. I open it and it says the neighbours daughter had sent a gift for Mother's day but neighbour is away. The note writer had come round to find it but they couldn't get past the gate and couldn't see it. They asked if I could keep an eye out for it and wrote \"at least you could eat them if you find them\". I walked down the drive and sure enough a gift bag was hanging from the locked gate. With flowers, a card and a box of four cupcakes. I brought them in, and took a picture of the note and gift and sent it to my friend who owns the house. She says lucky you. \nAt first I feel a bit weird and think oh I will leave them and then the next day I think, I don't know how long the neighbour is gone for, it would be bad if they go stale and go to waste and the note said to eat them so I ate them. \n\nThat week I am really busy with work and gym classes so I am leaving the house around 7am and not back until at least 8pm. When I do see that her car is back later that week it is at one of these awkward times.\n\nOn Saturday the neighbour comes by asking if I had seen the parcel her daughter had sent. I said yes, I have it and I show her the week old flowers, card and the note someone had left. She read it and said it was her sister in law. I mentioned that it was just the flowers and card as the cupcakes were now gone and gestured to the note saying to eat them.\n\nThe next evening the neighbour came round saying she wanted to clear the air. She then proceeded to tell me that she thought it was deplorable behaviour and it didn't sit right with her that I had eaten the cupcakes and she saw it as stealing. I should have text her and should have frozen the cupcakes so they would be saved for her. She said I should have called her sister in law who left the note, when I said I couldn't because I didn't have her number, she said it was on the note (I checked the picture I had of the note it wasn't). I said I did feel bad but the note had said to eat them and I had been very busy I hadn't been able to get down to her. She said that I could see when my car was there and I should have gone. She kept turning back that it was horrible behaviour, I was stealing and it crossed a line. I apologised profusely.\n\nAs soon as she left I burst into tears I felt so awful.\n\nI understand she is upset that she didn't get the full gift her daughter intended for her... but I feel like it was a bit harsh to say that I stole from her when I had written permission to eat the cupcakes.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684666848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nq0v3/aita_for_eating_the_neighbours_cupcakes/", "score": 2094, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're acting like you did someone a favor \"saving\" the cupcakes from going stale but you ate someone else's mother's day gift without her permission, which the note writer clearly had no authority to give and even if she did, she thought she was telling neighbor, not you. I don't think you needed to freeze them but putting them on neighbor's doorstep would have been the right call.", "I think this was a misunderstanding, based on the note. I think the neighbor is being harsh. NTA, bc of the note giving permission. The freezing idea is good in hindsight, but like\u2026 idk neighbor needs to realize the note gave you permission and get over themselves. You could have just left the package outside and it would have gone to waste\u2026 would neighbor think you were deplorable then? How about thanks for grabbing this for me, I personally wish you\u2019d frozen the cupcakes but seems the gift giver gave you permission so oh well. Better luck next time! \n\nTry not to feel bad. This neighbor sounds  mean!", "Wait did you eat ALL of the cupcakes? That\u2019s inconsiderate af considering it was YOUR schedule that kept you from bringing them to them in a timely manner. Just bc you got home after 8 doesn\u2019t mean you had a free pass to eat them. The card is confusing I give you that. I definitely would\u2019ve eaten ONE too, but ALL FOUR? OP why?!", "I would have just stuck them in the refrigerator I\u2019m not eating anything where I don\u2019t know who made it", "NTA The note said to eat them, there was no phone number to contact anyone with, and they would have been gross after a week. Note writer should not have said \"eat them\" if you couldn't, and they should have found a way to deliver it directly to the intended party rather than to someone who was house sitting. Neighbor is too upset to think logically. I like your idea of getting her new cupcakes.", "NTA. So many people are saying they would save the cupcakes as if the neighbor was only gone for a few hours. It seems like the neighbor was gone for a few days, which is why the sil came to look for the present. I firmly believe that the sil would have eaten the cupcakes too. It's literally just cupcakes. I don't gift my mother perishables when i know she won't be around to get them. It's possible that the daughter didn't know her mother would be away when she scheduled the delivery. Also, why is everyone assuming that the daughter didn't tell sil to leave in the note to eat the cupcakes so her money wasn't totally wasted? \n\nFood is meant to be enjoyed, If the cupcakes had been sitting out for a few hours already when op got them, they wouldn't have been good if they were left out for another day or two. Idk about yall, but I refrigerate my cakes and cupcakes immediately in order to have them last longer. Being left to the elements, even on a nice day, makes them risky.\n\nThe neighbor is upset cause she missed out on a gift she probably knew about and was looking forward to, and that's understandable. But to berate op the way she did was not okay. Clearly, the neighbor should be upset with sil, not someone who was literally given permission. Yall who said she should have assumed she needed to save them sound stupid and selfish. I would never assume that a gift of food that I wouldn't be getting for a few days would be saved by anyone I asked to watch out for my house. Also, delivery companies will tell you to keep the cupcakes and eat them. I know from experience. A delivery driver left a dozen chocolate covered strawberries on my porch that were intended for a woman who didn't live in the neighborhood. The delivery had the wrong address on it, and when I called to let them know, they told me they couldn't pick it up and deliver it again. I got a nice desert for a few days. Delivery places would rather deliver something again than risk the food item having gone bad.", "YTA. Since the SIL wasn't the recipient or sender, she had no right to tell you you could eat the cupcakes, and you had no right to eat them. Although, I would be willing to consider an everyone sucks here ruling because the neighbor should have told her daughter she wasn't going to be home around Mother's Day; that way the daughter could have sent perishable Mother's Day presents a week before or after so her mother could actually enjoy the gifts.\n\nOn a side note, you say the package was delivered Sunday and the neighbor returned later in the week. I'm guessing that means Wednesday/Thursday. If you were gone most of the day, and neither you nor the friend you were house sitting for had their phone number, you could have left a note in their mailbox letting them know you were holding a package for them. Or, since you knew they were home at this point, you could have just left it on their porch in the morning before leaving for work. You knew the gifts were perishable; you shouldn't have waited for them to reach out to you for a package they may not have known they were receiving.", "NTA frozen cake is horrible.  She went overboard accusing you of stealing and it doesn't sound like she appreciated you house sitting.  Boo to her.  Does she pay you at least?", "You are being way too hard on yourself and the neighbor is making way too big a deal over some cupcakes.\n\nYou did nothing dishonorable. You thought you had permission to eat the cupcakes.\n\nAll you can do is sincerely apologize and replace the cupcakes, but please don't be too hard on yourself about this. We're only human and we all make mistakes. If you want to call this a mistake, it was an honest one and you have good intentions.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "It was \"clear permission\" from the person who didn't send the cupcakes and wasn't gifted the cupcakes.  To me it's a little like saying one neighbor told me I had permission to take an Amazon package off another neighbors porch because they weren't home and were on vacation and whatever it was would go bad.", "To be fair, you *can* freeze cake.  I've seen it frequently on cake decorating shows.  If they aren't expected to bake the cakes then and there, it seems (from some of the shows I've watched) like it's common to bring already baked and frozen sheet cakes with you.  And even on shows where they need to bake right then they frequently chill them.\n\nIt makes them firmer and easier to cut, shape, and mold.  Particularly when you are trying to make some sort of elaborate design.\n\nI would point out though, they are freezing plain, undecorated cakes.\n\nI've also seen (in my personal life) people freeze muffins  and cookies (again plain and undecorated).\n\nSo...I think freezing cupcakes can be done.  They can be thawed out and reheated and should be fine.  But...I don't think trying to freeze a fully frosted and decorated cupcake would turn out quite the same way.  I'd imagine the frosting and decorations would likely not turn out well.  And you can't really reheat a frosted cupcake without somehow prying the frosting off.  Frosting that gets cooked would just melt/liquefy.\n\n(To the final point about freezing food for people you don't know without instruction to do so...I kind of agree.  Firstly because you don't know these people.  They might be unhappy if it's frozen.  You don't know if freezing will wreck the item.  You don't know what's in the item or whether or not placing it your or your friends freezer might affect something else in that freezer negatively.  You don't know what else your friend might have in their freezer that might affect the cupcakes negatively.  Etc.  Secondly because the other people don't really know you.  They don't know if you have a freezer, if it works, if there's room in it, if it's clean, what else it's used for....I have seen, as some examples, people who use random crap in the freezer as ice packs, where they are pressed against whatever body part needs ice, and then thrown back in once they start to warm up too much to still be effective...people who freeze the remains of pets if they can't be buried right away (ie ground is frozen), people who just don't clean their freezers, people who hide valuables or money in their freezer...etc.  Point is you just don't know.  So it's weird.  Like...how would that neighbor have felt if OP had frozen the cupcakes, they ate them, and then found out later that the cupcakes had been stored in the freezer next to fluffy's remains and grandma's jewelry?  And that steak/bag of frozen peas/whatever that's been used as headache relief for generations?

You stick it in the fridge and wait.  The chief danger is if it's been airbrushed or has very saturated icing, the condensation from thawing can cause the color to run.  Blacks and reds are bad for that. Otherwise unless it's been frozen a long enough time for freezer burn to set in, it's good to go.

Saying you should have frozen them.", "OP even stated that the neighbor knew the friend and her so one had to have her number to call and ask what to do about the gifts.", "Awh thanks, anytime though I must inform you I have a new policy on not doing anything for any neighbours of the house I look after.  I have learned my lesson.", "So I am living in the southern hemisphere so it is autumn going into winter now. It is dark early around 6ish.\n\nI left the house each day before 7am...sometimes 6:30 sometimes just on 7... both times didn't feel appropriate to stop by. \n\nI would then come back after 8pm one night (the one I noticed her gate now unlocked) I was back at 11:30pm and had to leave at 6:30 the next morning. I didn't feel like it was appropriate to come after 8/8:30ish which is when I was arriving smelly back from the gym. \n\nI know it's feeling a little bit ironic that my idea of trying not to come over at a rude time has turned into one of the main reasons people think I didn't make an effort to go over. \nI do see their point but this was my train of thought through the week when I did finally see her gate open and car back.", "Starbucks baked goods are all frozen when the stores receive them. Freezing cake is a great option", "We froze the top of our wedding cake because it\u2019s a tradition to defrost it a year later on your anniversary and eat it. And it was still delicious. In fact, we did it two years in a row. Still delicious two years later.", "Didn't *notice* doesn't mean she wasn't there. And cupcakes are packaged in containers, they're not just naked cupcakes in the weather. They'd have been fine in their packaging until neighbor returned. And even if they weren't fine, doesn't matter, they belong to neighbor and she has a right to expect them to be ruined on her doorstep rather than eaten by the neighbor's pet sitter. They were the property of neighbor to do with as she pleases, it's not OP's job to \"save the cupcakes\".", "i can relate to both your comment and the above. i\u2019m overly empathetic as well as clueless. it\u2019s the autism. (for me lol)", "OP's description was a little confusing to me, and I wasn't initially sure why the SIL was looking for the gift at all, but after reading everything the scene in my head is something like this:\n\n> Daughter: Hey Auntie. Just dropped off a lovely gift for mum. Can't wait for her to find it. It's her favourite \ud83d\ude0a\n\n> Aunt: You dropped it off outside her place? Didn't she tell you? She's out of town for the next few days.\n\n> Daughter: Omfg I totally forgot all about that. I'm such an idiot. Now the cupcakes I got her will probably end up rained on or eaten by rats because I don't have time to go pick them up.\n\n> Aunt: Don't worry about it, I'll pop over and grab the package.\n\n> [later]\n\n> Aunt: I couldn't find the gift, sorry. I just left a note for the neighbour telling them to eat it if they see it. That way at least those cupcakes won't go to waste.\n\nI think something similar to that is the most likely explanation for why a gift was dropped off for someone out of town and for why a third person was over looking for the gift. There are several possibilities (like maybe delivery of the gift was arranged in advance, then the mother arranged the trip and it was too late to cancel the gift) but most plausible ones to me seem to me to be in this vein. In particular, the aunt/sister-in-law probably has authorisation from the gift-giver to take possession of the cupcakes.\n\nAnd in a scenario like that, I say eating the food is fair game. That's what the note says to do!", "You ate four cupcakes in one day?    Really?", "Like the neighbor said you could have frozen them, and if the neighbors knew even you friend, she likely had the neighbor's phone number that you could have been a grown up and called and said, \"Hey, your daughter left gifts for you. A card, flowers, cupcakes. Would you like me to try to keep the flowers alive until you get back. And what should I do about the cupcakes?\"", "Mental gymnastics. Cupcakes can sit on the counter or in the fridge for a couple of days. Just say they looked good, so instead of attempting to deliver them, you ate them with the thinly veiled excuse of the note\u2026", "I do know people who\u2019ve had pets poisoned by neighbors intentionally. Idk if that counts.", "She should not have eaten them. That is tacky. She could have bought some cupcakes herself. So she is the AH."]}
