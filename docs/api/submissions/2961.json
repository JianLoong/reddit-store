These things can take a long time if one party is contesting or making things difficult. A person can decide to separate from their spouse and leave the relationship whether their spouse agrees or not, an actual divorce is not that easy.

It\u2019s a year if you have minor children.", "Did you really try to excuse being a deadbeat because his kids hurt his feelings?? That\u2019s ridiculous", "I did tell my mom I was happy to have Christmas with her another time or on Christmas Eve, I\u2019m not withholding Christmas from her. But I do understand how it feels manipulative. I have a lot to think about.", "If that's what you want, then sure.", "What\u2019s fanning the fire about it? The wife and him were separated, just not yet divorced. So there\u2019s no home-wrecking done. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s seen that way?", ">But, she is making a huge mistake if she ignores the wishes of daughter and son who don't approve of sister attending.\n\nIs she? I think it would be better to allow the two that have an issue with attending to choose whether or not to attend, rather than uninviting one of her children, who has done nothing wrong.", "It's absolutely his/her choice if they attend. However it seems like they have already floated this idea past the host, been told that the host does not agree, and are somehow thinking that they still have the right to decide whether or not the guy attends Christmas. And they are planning to achieve that by emotionally manipulating the host because they know she wants to spend Christmas with OP's baby, as its their first Christmas. All of that is pretty AH-y behaviour!", "But, how have you made it this far in life knowing nothing about arranged marriages? It's *literally in the name*.", "Aw you are so cute to think that having two kids means love. No sugar having two kids means they f\\*\\*\\*ed. You don't need love to make babies.", "You keep bringing it back to arranged marriages, but how their marriage started doesn't matter all that much in this scenario. The fact is, the marriage ended, he asked for a divorce, they were separated, and are now divorced. The ex wife tried t  refuse a divorce and demand that they stay together. That isn't fighting for your marriage - that is being controlling. Your sister started dating her BF post separation, so his former relationship is really none of your business - arranged or not.\n\nThere are many marriages that started out with two people being in love, and then decend into misery. Having children is also not an indication of happiness or a healthy marriage. That's just an indication that two people procreated.", "Forget arranged marriages, normal marriages don't have to be happy to have kids. How about you open your mind and maybe keep your mouth shut. You don't know anything and injecting your judgment here is 100000% uncalled for and really horrible to your sister.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a legal separation in Texas. I had to wait 60 days from filing to requesting a court date. Legal zoom and about $300 in court fees and an uncontested divorce. We even had kids and he signed the papers in front of a notary and didn\u2019t even show up in court.", "I mean, do you like your sister? I feel like you must have a reason to be so certain she was in the wrong here. \n\nMy mother was in a similar circumstance once, where she got involved with someone who had left his wife a good six months earlier. I know the timeline because I lived with her and I absolutely know when they got together. She barely knew him when the marriage broke up. \n\nDidn't stop people from speculating and his ex-wife from spreading lies about the situation. She's mad to this day, and the man in question has been dead for 28 years. \n\nI just don't know why you'd want to create this much drama when you are acting out of something that's mostly just your personal feelings. Unless you have a longstanding resentment of your sister informing your actions.", "It sounds like you already have issues with your sister since you jumped to blaming her. Maybe meeting the guy before Christmas will take more pressure off of it being \"judgement time\"? I get that it's your baby's first Christmas and this sounds like drama you didn't want. But it is a family event, and while YOU can choose to make the focus \"Baby's First Christmas,\" your sister is going to make the focus \"Meet My New Partner.\" Regardless of what happened, it isn't your business besides being gossip on the side. Figure out how to make it work if you care about your mom. If you have issues with your mom as well, and are looking for reasons to draw boundaries and go low contact, you are allowed to do that WITHOUT A SOLID REASON. Many people do that already. Just know that drawing a hard line of \"we will have separate Christmas for you, mom, because sister and I don't get along\" DOES make you the AH. (I have chosen to do this for Thanksgiving this year, I am the AH to the rest of my fam but I am ok with it and not asking for judgement here because I know my sister and I have issues that are not being resolved easily and neither of us is in a place to be controlling of our own emotions to make for an enjoyable experience for anyone. So I took the L and am the AH, but I also get to enjoy a drama-free holiday. I did not, however, say it was because of xyz, I straight up said \"you know how we are, I don't feel up to it. Thanks anyway.\") Good luck, and if you feel like \"having a lot to think about\" means that you also \"have a lot to work on\" personally, I highly suggest getting a counselor to help you work through family dynamics you don't want to repeat in your own children's lives. Best of luck.", "You have a lot of growing up to do. You sound absolutely awful to deal with. I feel bad for your entire family.", "The way OP wrote it sounds like the guy was in an unhappy marriage (valid) and was seeking something else while still married to his wife who did not want to seperate (tricky, but I find this not valid), and OP's sister was complicit in this by sticking by the guy. I get that the heart wants what it wants, but the sister and him couldn't wait or something? It seems kind of like the guy and sis got together before the wife knew about it. At least that how * interpreted it.", "Very sheltered and ignorant people are often extremely judgemental too.", "I do like my sister, but the reason I\u2019m so unsure on the timeline is because they worked together and were on and off for a while. She doesn\u2019t live in the same city as me, and I\u2019m hearing most of the info from my mom who is trying to paint her in the best light. I understand that I\u2019m judging something that really isn\u2019t my business, I just find cheating so gross that it\u2019s hard for me to get over that. I do see from other comments that an arranged marriage is something I have no understanding of so I may be completely wrong about the situation so I will try to accept that and move forward.", "Well OP does seem biased - he says they were supposedly separated. He just chooses not to believe that.", "I mean, if you love your sister I don't know why you'd be so eager to judge her and assume the worst. I'd forgive my sibling far more with actual facts, let alone just a vague suspicion. \n\nI will tell you in my situation I do understand why people speculated, but I also know they were very wrong and it caused pain that wasn't deserved. Really awful (and in some cases illegal) things had happened in that marriage and if you have lived a life that has protected you from knowing what kind of hell spouses can bring down on each other, I am happy for you. But one reason people have \"sob stories\" is because bad things have happened to them. You hate cheaters -- how do you feel about abusers?", "You\u2019ll try to move forward? Lol. I hope the other people involved (your mom, sister, and the new boyfriend) don\u2019t move on as quickly. I can\u2019t even imagine my sister treating me this way.", "If you\u2019re going to jump to the conclusion that your sister was in the wrong in this situation because you assumed your mom would paint her in the best light possible, I don\u2019t think you like your sister *that* much. I wonder if your mom talks about you and your other siblings the same way \u2014 you know, painting her *children* in the \u201cbest light.\u201d I\u2019ve been told that\u2019s what good parents tend to do\u2026\n\nYou come off as the morality police. I think you might want to look internally to understand why your sister\u2019s situation has lead to so much judgment from you and the rest of your siblings. It just feels like there\u2019s something you\u2019re not mentioning\u2026", "You don't know they cheated! Dear God. It took me almost 2 years after my ex and I split to get a divorce and I was almost engaged by then. Please mind your business and get your bias in check.", "Sometimes when you don\u2019t have all the information and can\u2019t be sure of wrongdoing, it\u2019s best to give the benefit of doubt. I\u2019d rather err on acceptance and love than unjustly treat people badly when they may have done nothing wrong at all.", "That\u2019s a good point you make about cheaters vs abusers. Perhaps her fighting for their marriage was her way of emotionally abusing when he wanted to be done. Appreciate the insight and sorry you experienced the discrimination yourself.", "I have only ever expressed my distaste to my mom, never to my sister. We just don\u2019t talk about it. Everyone\u2019s comments are shedding a little more light on things I hadn\u2019t previously considered, so yes I\u2019ll be moving forward with more understanding and empathy.", "I appreciate you being open to the conversation. I hope you and your family are able to enjoy the holiday.", "your sister might not be aware right now about your initial ~~blackm~~ reaction with your mom but someday, somehow, she probably will. If you are serious about being more open to her situation you might also want to start thinking about how to preventively defuse that ticking time bomb."]}
