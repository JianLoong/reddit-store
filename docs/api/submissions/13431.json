(Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) This includes my cousin, who had a baby about 3.5 years ago. My cousin will be named Carol and the baby will be named Lily for this post. I don't like children, never have, and possibly never will. My whole family knows this. So, I haven't really spent the most time with Lily when I've visited. Surprisingly, she wasn't too bad the last few times I visited her and Carol along with my other family. However, this time Lily was an absolute hellspawn. Screaming, crying, throwing tantrums along with things across the room. We were staying in the same house so I heard it every day for a few days. I distanced myself from Carol and Lily as much as possible, other than the time I got mad at Carol, and a bit at Lily, when Lily was throwing a tantrum about something and threw my phone to the floor, cracking the corner of the screen. Carol said I was overreacting.\n\nYesterday, I was watching television in the living room when Carol came in the room carrying Lily, who was fussing. She asked me to watch her for the day because she needed a break, but I wasn't so sure. As I said, I don't like kids in the first place, but I'm also not sure I could take care of one, especially one as bad as Lily. I explained this to Carol and she insisted I take care of Lily. I asked if anybody else can take Lily because I won't, and she told me everyone else was out shopping, and how I don't know how hard it is to be a mother and the least I can do is help out. I told her I understand how she's struggling but reinstated my doubts on taking care of another human being. Carol called me heartless and stormed out of the room to go and take care of Lily herself.\n\nA little over 15 minutes later, everyone returned. Carol, of course, told them what I did and everyone was being cold to me for the rest of the day. This morning, I left because I was getting uncomfortable with how I was being treated and felt like I wasn't welcome because I wouldn't take care of Lily. This was met with sad or angry comments from some, but I left anyway. I'm writing this in a hotel because now I'm having second thoughts.

It's like Carol thought, \"Hm, who is the most ill equipt person to care for my womb nugget; Ah! OP, yes, she'll do. My only babysitting requirements are a set of breasts and a liability waiting to happen.\"\n\nI get it, it takes a village and everyone needs a break once in a while.

Phones are expensive.\n\nSecond, taking care of the baby was NOT your responsibility and you had every right to say no. She should have accepted your answer and left it at that, and either hire a sitter or wait until the rest of the family was back and ask them to help for awhile.\n\nThirdly, what mom would hear \"I don't know if I could take care of her\" and think it's okay to keep pushing it? Babies are a lot of work, and for your child's own safety, you shouldn't let someone take care of your kid if they aren't confident in doing so.", "NTA.  \nWatching your cousin\u2019s child is not your responsibility.

Then, to bad mouth you to the rest of the family because you had boundaries that she crossed is the craziest part.  \n\nGood on you for standing your ground and leaving when you felt uncomfortable.

She asked. You said no. End of discussion. Carol had a whole slew of family she could ask for help. To ask and then berate the one person she knew wouldn't want to speaks to her character, not yours.

A parent at the end of their rope is worth some discomfort for sake of safety and love of family.\n\nBut an open-ended dumping on you with no warning and knowing you're not only not into kids but specifically that one has just caused you property damage? No, that's not rational,  and your family is being unreasonable to be mad at you.\n\nYour cousin was probably very very embarrassed by her kid's behavior, I know I sure was when my kid was being a brat, especially when it happened when we were with seldom-seen family where I both really wanted my kiddo to be adored and myself validated as a mom. We can't always control their moods but we definitely feel like we should and we know darn well when our kids are being beasts and feel both internal and external judgement because of it. \n\nSo your cousin was not at her best, feeling defensive and probably a little defeated, since you say this isn't how her kid normally acts. I hope you can forgive her for being entitled and causing drama over this so unfairly. Hopefully it's just a brief lapse into selfishness caused by stress and lack of sleep, and this doesn't have to turn into a larger rift. Parenting is hard and while we do choose it, parents are helping create the next generation, so giving a little grace now and then is appreciated.", "NTA\n\nI am a female in my early 60s. I do NOT babysit nor do I ever babysit \u2026with the exception of one time in my life. \nI was about 25 and I babysat  my three nieces and one nephew so that my brother and his wife and my sister and her husband could all go out to dinner.\nThey were totally good kids and we had a great time but it\u2019s just not for me.\n\nSo I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. \nI don\u2019t have children of my own because I chose not to have children of my own.", " No. Kudos to you for knowing you don't have what it takes to watch a toddler. They are a handful. I wouldn't want my child watched by someone who doesn't want to do it. Although, I have never been a parent to pawn off my responsibilities.", "NTA if i had a kid and needed somebody to take care of my baby i would want somebody who knows how or atleast is confident amd willing idk about other people but if somebody said they didnt think they could take care of my kid i would find somebody else", "NTA, her spawn is not your responsibility. I have two kids, less than 2 years apart, and both with adhd, some days are FUCKING terrible and I want to cry, some days I do cry, on none of those days would I have the audacity to demand someone else watch them.", "NTA for this specific request.  It was too much, too last minute, and you clearly aren\u2019t qualified.  Lily sounds like a developmentally normal 3.5 year old, so using words like \u201cbad\u201d and \u201chellspawn\u201d make you AH-ish. You don\u2019t have to judge her for being a toddler.  You also don\u2019t have to babysit her.", " No. Kudos to you for knowing you don't have what it takes to watch a toddler. They are a handful. I wouldn't want my child watched by someone who doesn't want to do it. Although, I have never been a parent to pawn off my responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nso when is she repairing/replacing your phone?", "NTA - No is no.", "Not the asshole.", "NTA, and honestly as a parent she should never ask someone who is uncomfortable with children to watch them. Like as much as i love my family members, some of them are not good with children and make it known (but aren\u2019t rude) and they are neverrrrr an option for me when i need childcare.", "NTA you're not obligated to watch someone else's kid even if they are family, and if your other relatives feel so strongly about it, they can watch the kid.", "NTA \n\nWhy do people have kids and then demand help? \n\nUnless is an emergency you were NTA for refusing to watch her child. She could have called a babysitter or put her is a daycare-play time place for a few hours.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your kid. It would be nice to help the mom out, like make her lunch, help clean the house, or do some laundry. If you are not comfortable watching over a child you shouldn\u2019t. They try to unalive themselves on accident cause kids are stupid.", "NTA. The audacity! Head on over to r/childfree for like-minded folks and a list of sterilization friendly doctors.", "NTA  Maybe,  maaayyybeee, if she had asked you to watch her for half an hour so Carol could take a shower, that might be reasonable.  But just to plunk her kid down with no prior discussion and expect you to take care of her for a day - not even if you loved kids is that acceptable.", "NTA\n\nAlso, your family is super toxic taken as a whole. I think it's nice that there are some of them that you'd like to stay in contact with, but if I were you I'd be more selective, and take them in smaller doses. \n\nNot for nothing, but you're old enough now that some of the \"troublesome\" aspects of your family are going to come to light. It's common that people try to hide the worst of themselves, or put on a good face \"for the children,\" but you're not a children anymore.  :)  \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that while it's obviously socially unpopular, you should be commended for drawing a firm line here. There are a lot of people that might have the same misgivings as you, but not the courage to say, \"I shouldn't be made to be responsible for a child.\"\n\nI also find it hilarious and borderline suspicious that your family came back so soon after your sister tried to hand off the kid. It smells a little like a setup to me.", "That is what I was thinking. As a father, I would never let my child be looked after by someone who couldn't/didn't want to.", "I have a child a bit older than lily, and I would never have someone watch him that wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about it? Like go, my divine undertaking, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood- go to that person who hates you and be at their unsupervised mercy for hours. \n\nBro you KNOW they\u2019re not going to be cutting the crusts off.", "An ENTIRE FUCKING DAY. I was sure when I started reading the sentence it was going to be like \u201cplease make sure she doesn\u2019t die for an hour while I nap.\u201d \nIs that people don\u2019t realize they have to be parents 24/7 when they choose to have kids, that the kid breaks their brain and they forget?", "Makes me wonder if this was some convoluted way to change your mind about kids. I don\u2019t know how you could\u2019ve been more clear that it was a bad idea. You did not choose to have a child. If she wanted to go out without Lily, she should have arranged for someone to take care of her. This wasn\u2019t an emergency. Asking you last minute and then getting mad at you for setting a boundary is an AH move. NTA OP.", "I triple double support the above statement. Being a mom friggin sucks sometimes, sorry Carol. NTA\u2026 my daughter is 16 and has hated kids for like\u2026 ever. I get where OP is coming from.", "I really cannot fathom why people with kids insist that their child be taken care of by someone who has explicitly stated not wanting to do so/has made comments about hating kids.", "I\u2019m ok with kids and I don\u2019t mind babysitting, but if even my best friends just suddenly tried to dump their kid on me for a whole day, I would have zero patience for that.", "It does not help that she asked OP to watch her for the DAY. It would have been reasonable to say \u201chey I\u2019m really overwhelmed and no one else is here do you mind just keeping an eye on her for 10 minutes so I can take a breather\u201d and then the family would have come back and helped too. It sounds like the cousin is super entitled.", "oh my god \"spawn\" i'm dying\n\nthank you!", "Isn\u2019t it kind of dangerous? \n\nLike, there are probably a bunch of potential hazards for toddlers that would not immediately occur to me, but would be obvious to someone who either is a parent or who has childcare experience.", "No is a complete sentence, and it sounds like she keeps this cousin at arms length for a reason. Don't stick your neck out for people like this, especially if they don't offer to replace things their child breaks.", "I'm child-free and have been asked to babysit by my parent friend from time to time. I did once or twice when the child was 1 year old. He's 8 or 9 now and on the spectrum, which I have absolutely no experience with. Plus, I have developed chronic illnesses since that time which would only exacerbate any potential emergency.\n\nParent friend has had to cancel trips a lot since she can't always find a babysitter, but I think that's a lot better than me being in an emergency situation with her child.", "I am not cutting the crusts off, AND I am NOT giving them a silly straw for their 2% milk.", "Seems to me no one else could do it and everyone got mad at op instead because they don't want to watch a difficult toddler and if op had just agreed none of them would be at risk of being asked.", "It absolutely could have been this combined with them planning on making OP the designated babysitter for the vacation (because she's a woman, to change her mind, because she wasn't coupled if everyone else was etc). Good job not allowing that to happen OP.", "I don't think complaining about how hard parenting is and she definitely needs a break and here get her own child away from her is going to make anyone feel positive about having kids.", "Will you be upgrading the nickname to Tendy?", "I call my son \"nugget\" often enough I'm worried he'll start to think it's his actual name.", "What I don\u2019t get is\u2026if someone tells a parent that they can\u2019t watch a child or they don\u2019t end to..why insist? As a parent you want the person watching your kid to be responsible and caring. Unless it\u2019s an emergency I would not put a child through that.", "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all. Had this been an actual emergency, I\u2019d understand why OP was asked. You\u2019d think the sister would want someone who likes kids to watch her.", "Fair point. I\u2019ve had people do this to me which is why I was wondering if it was that similar to OP\u2019s experience.", "You triggered some memories there:  \"This has been a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. If this had been an actual emergency...\"", "It's not ideal but if Carol has a history of this behavior, then it's easy to see why she's single.", "Lol", "Particularly with a bunch of extra people in the house; I can see how that would stress out/upset a tiny child.\n\nCarol's reaction to OP's phone being thrown and the screen being cracked and her insistence that OP watch Lily, though, does make her an AH and makes me wonder about her in general.", ">Maybe Carol did create a monster. But it's also just as likely that OP caught them on a bad week.\n\nRegardless, no one is obligated to watch a child that isn't theira and OP's decision should have been respected.", "Oh yeah, the phone thing makes her TA in my opinion.\n\nI'm just not convinced she always is one. Unrelenting stress can turn you into one faster than you realize.\n\nThat's my question. Is she like this all the time... or was this just a really bad three days for her?"]}
