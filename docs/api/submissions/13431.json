(Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) This includes my cousin, who had a baby about 3.5 years ago. My cousin will be named Carol and the baby will be named Lily for this post. I don't like children, never have, and possibly never will. My whole family knows this. So, I haven't really spent the most time with Lily when I've visited. Surprisingly, she wasn't too bad the last few times I visited her and Carol along with my other family. However, this time Lily was an absolute hellspawn. Screaming, crying, throwing tantrums along with things across the room. We were staying in the same house so I heard it every day for a few days. I distanced myself from Carol and Lily as much as possible, other than the time I got mad at Carol, and a bit at Lily, when Lily was throwing a tantrum about something and threw my phone to the floor, cracking the corner of the screen. Carol said I was overreacting.\n\nYesterday, I was watching television in the living room when Carol came in the room carrying Lily, who was fussing. She asked me to watch her for the day because she needed a break, but I wasn't so sure. As I said, I don't like kids in the first place, but I'm also not sure I could take care of one, especially one as bad as Lily. I explained this to Carol and she insisted I take care of Lily. I asked if anybody else can take Lily because I won't, and she told me everyone else was out shopping, and how I don't know how hard it is to be a mother and the least I can do is help out. I told her I understand how she's struggling but reinstated my doubts on taking care of another human being. Carol called me heartless and stormed out of the room to go and take care of Lily herself.\n\nA little over 15 minutes later, everyone returned. Carol, of course, told them what I did and everyone was being cold to me for the rest of the day. This morning, I left because I was getting uncomfortable with how I was being treated and felt like I wasn't welcome because I wouldn't take care of Lily. This was met with sad or angry comments from some, but I left anyway. I'm writing this in a hotel because now I'm having second thoughts.

It's like Carol thought, \"Hm, who is the most ill equipt person to care for my womb nugget; Ah! OP, yes, she'll do. My only babysitting requirements are a set of breasts and a liability waiting to happen.\"\n\nI get it, it takes a village and everyone needs a break once in a while.

It's actually offputting that she would want you to since you dont care for children.", "NTA - for some reason, people love trying to guilt people who don't like kids into providing free childcare.\n\nFirst off, being angry about your screen getting cracked is *not* an overreaction. Phones are expensive.\n\nSecond, taking care of the baby was NOT your responsibility and you had every right to say no. She should have accepted your answer and left it at that, and either hire a sitter or wait until the rest of the family was back and ask them to help for awhile.\n\nThirdly, what mom would hear \"I don't know if I could take care of her\" and think it's okay to keep pushing it? Babies are a lot of work, and for your child's own safety, you shouldn't let someone take care of your kid if they aren't confident in doing so.", "NTA.  \nWatching your cousin\u2019s child is not your responsibility.

If you dislike kids and have no experience with them, it's actually highly risky to leave a kid with someone in your position- not because you'd harm the kid, but because the lack of knowledge could mean accidentally doing the wrong thing. There was no emergency situation to warrant requesting your services, either. The only thing you owe this kid is to be civil towards her. Nothing more, nothing less.", "NTA. The entitlement Carol has to think you're obligated to watch HER child is ridiculous. She chose to have kids, so that's her responsibility. Then, she tries to guilt trip you into doing it simply because you \"don't know how hard it is to be a mother.\" I'm sure being a mother is hard, but that was a choice she made, and it's not her decision to try to pass that burden on to you without your consent. Then, to bad mouth you to the rest of the family because you had boundaries that she crossed is the craziest part.  \n\nGood on you for standing your ground and leaving when you felt uncomfortable.

She asked. You said no. End of discussion. Carol had a whole slew of family she could ask for help. To ask and then berate the one person she knew wouldn't want to speaks to her character, not yours.

No, that's not rational,  and your family is being unreasonable to be mad at you.\n\nYour cousin was probably very very embarrassed by her kid's behavior, I know I sure was when my kid was being a brat, especially when it happened when we were with seldom-seen family where I both really wanted my kiddo to be adored and myself validated as a mom. We can't always control their moods but we definitely feel like we should and we know darn well when our kids are being beasts and feel both internal and external judgement because of it. \n\nSo your cousin was not at her best, feeling defensive and probably a little defeated, since you say this isn't how her kid normally acts. I hope you can forgive her for being entitled and causing drama over this so unfairly.

Your kid damages someone else's property worth, what, $500-$1200 and you have the audacity to demand they provide free childcare for that same child on their vacation? And OP didn't mention compensation or even an apology, so I'll assume it wasn't offered. \n\nI don't doubt the mother is struggling, but that's not OPs concern. Sure, it'd be a nice gesture to let her rest, but it shouldn't be expected, especially from someone who everyone knows has no desire or experience with kids", "They are mad at OP, because now they are going to be asked to take care of hell-spawn.

They can scream loudly... For quite some time. Against Geneva convention style. Most adults break.
