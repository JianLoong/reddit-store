(Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) This includes my cousin, who had a baby about 3.5 years ago. My cousin will be named Carol and the baby will be named Lily for this post. I don't like children, never have, and possibly never will. My whole family knows this. So, I haven't really spent the most time with Lily when I've visited. Surprisingly, she wasn't too bad the last few times I visited her and Carol along with my other family. However, this time Lily was an absolute hellspawn. Screaming, crying, throwing tantrums along with things across the room. We were staying in the same house so I heard it every day for a few days. I distanced myself from Carol and Lily as much as possible, other than the time I got mad at Carol, and a bit at Lily, when Lily was throwing a tantrum about something and threw my phone to the floor, cracking the corner of the screen. Carol said I was overreacting.\n\nYesterday, I was watching television in the living room when Carol came in the room carrying Lily, who was fussing. She asked me to watch her for the day because she needed a break, but I wasn't so sure. As I said, I don't like kids in the first place, but I'm also not sure I could take care of one, especially one as bad as Lily. I explained this to Carol and she insisted I take care of Lily. I asked if anybody else can take Lily because I won't, and she told me everyone else was out shopping, and how I don't know how hard it is to be a mother and the least I can do is help out. I told her I understand how she's struggling but reinstated my doubts on taking care of another human being. Carol called me heartless and stormed out of the room to go and take care of Lily herself.\n\nA little over 15 minutes later, everyone returned. Carol, of course, told them what I did and everyone was being cold to me for the rest of the day. This morning, I left because I was getting uncomfortable with how I was being treated and felt like I wasn't welcome because I wouldn't take care of Lily. This was met with sad or angry comments from some, but I left anyway. I'm writing this in a hotel because now I'm having second thoughts. Was I the AH for not taking care of Lily?", "created_utc": 1680042680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1254onw/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_cousins_toddler/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One would assume you probably wouldn't have had a lot of experience with babies or toddlers and wouldn't really know how to care for one. It's like Carol thought, \"Hm, who is the most ill equipt person to care for my womb nugget; Ah! OP, yes, she'll do. My only babysitting requirements are a set of breasts and a liability waiting to happen.\"\n\nI get it, it takes a village and everyone needs a break once in a while.

I doubt she will but ask her anyway and point out to people she owes you money for what Lily did to your phone if they ask why you're watching her.", "NTA. There\u2019s probably a good reason the rest of the family bailed on Carol to go shopping. They didn\u2019t want to watch Lily either ( or even have lily join them) so they\u2019re deflecting the blame on you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't asked, you were told. You're allowed to say no.", "In NO WAY were you wrong. I'm the mother of 4. I chose to have. It is no ones responsibility but mine and thier dad.  It's actually offputting that she would want you to since you dont care for children.", "NTA - for some reason, people love trying to guilt people who don't like kids into providing free childcare.\n\nFirst off, being angry about your screen getting cracked is *not* an overreaction. Phones are expensive.\n\nSecond, taking care of the baby was NOT your responsibility and you had every right to say no. She should have accepted your answer and left it at that, and either hire a sitter or wait until the rest of the family was back and ask them to help for awhile.\n\nThirdly, what mom would hear \"I don't know if I could take care of her\" and think it's okay to keep pushing it? Babies are a lot of work, and for your child's own safety, you shouldn't let someone take care of your kid if they aren't confident in doing so.", "NTA.  \nWatching your cousin\u2019s child is not your responsibility.  It was not an emergency.  It was a request and you said no.  Should have been respected.", "NTA. You legitimately did not think you could handle the responsibility of taking care of this child. There's nothing wrong with that. Frankly, as a mom, I wouldn't want to leave my kid with someone who wasn't at least relatively certain that they could handle it. I really can't believe your aunt would leave her child with you when you were honest that you didn't think you were up for the job.", "NTA.

If you dislike kids and have no experience with them, it's actually highly risky to leave a kid with someone in your position- not because you'd harm the kid, but because the lack of knowledge could mean accidentally doing the wrong thing. There was no emergency situation to warrant requesting your services, either. The only thing you owe this kid is to be civil towards her. Nothing more, nothing less.", "NTA. The entitlement Carol has to think you're obligated to watch HER child is ridiculous. She chose to have kids, so that's her responsibility. Then, she tries to guilt trip you into doing it simply because you \"don't know how hard it is to be a mother.\" I'm sure being a mother is hard, but that was a choice she made, and it's not her decision to try to pass that burden on to you without your consent. Then, to bad mouth you to the rest of the family because you had boundaries that she crossed is the craziest part.  \n\nGood on you for standing your ground and leaving when you felt uncomfortable.

While it's understandable that Carol may have been struggling, she should not have insisted that you take care of Lily if you were uncomfortable with it. Calling you heartless and telling the rest of the family was not fair to you either. It's important for families to communicate and respect each other's boundaries and feelings.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem. Sounds like she's raising the kid without ever hearing the word \"no\" and then wants someone else to deal with the nightmare she created. Yes I understand kids that age can flip switches from angel to opposite in a second. But if she's constantly having bad behavior, the mom isn't helping her process the emotions in a healthy way. Even if the kid was super agreeable, you're not required to help watch her even if they offered payment.", "NTA. Carol chose that life. You didn\u2019t.

As a parent, I cannot understand why somebody would be pushy or insistent with a person who clearly does not want to watch their child.  It really doesn't sound like the best thing for the child.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence. I'm so sick of seeing posts on here about parents expecting free childcare... We all know being a parent is exhausting and you need a break but if the person you're asking to relieve you says no then *move on to the next option or find another one.*\n\nIt's not your kid, it's not your problem.

People call it the terrible twos and we called it the, excuse my language, the fucking fours. Toddlers are HARD. On top of that, it sounds like your cousin isn't doing much in the way of correcting or redirecting her daughter. No one has to like children. No one has to like specific children, family or not. She asked. You said no. End of discussion. Carol had a whole slew of family she could ask for help. To ask and then berate the one person she knew wouldn't want to speaks to her character, not yours. She was looking for a fight then to play victim and your family is just as bad for feeding into it. Don't feel guilty, you did nothing wrong. Carol owes you the money to pay to fix your phone too.", "info: how did the child obtain your phone? \n\nNTA overall for not wanting to take care of the child. it shouldn\u2019t be expected of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
