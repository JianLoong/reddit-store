We were both drunk, and I think we both forced it a bit. We get on great as people, but our sex life has been an issue since we had children. \n\nThis has only gotten worse since last year my husband told me he 'loves me but doesn't find me attractive sexually anymore' which was upsetting and hurtful as in the past three years I have gained over 100lbs.\n\nWe are staying in an amazing 5 star resort, the hotel rooms has its own small pool and terrace to sit out on.

Since they have arrived we have heard them having sex more or less twice a day, in addition when they are sat on the terrace they are kissing and all over each other, in addition the woman next door is sunbathing topless. I know we are in Europe and thats the norm but I find it hard to get use to.\n\nMy husband quickly befriended them over the balcony, and truthfully I think lusting over the woman next door.

I went and asked the concierge if they could ask them to keep it down.\n\nObviously having been told something, last night the man next door angrily told my husband if he had an issue he should of said something directly. My husband did not know I had reported it, and we then argued all yesterday evening.\n\nMy husband called me ridiculous and a prude and that if I was 'more carefree' we wouldn't have any issues.

You let your jealousy and insecurity get the better of you. You weren't happy with how your vacation is going and took it out on a couple for being happy and doing what people do in hotels.", "YTA - it aint the neighbors you have a problem with hunny.  \n\nYeah sure, asked to be moved rooms as you can hear the nieghbors... all night long... but it is not your husbands fault the neighbors seem nice.  \n\nY'all got big ol issues and a 12 day vacation probably wont fix anything. What it will do is make the issues bubble to the surface so you can deal with them.  \n\nHave some drinks, get some sun, find a book, relax, - the nieghbors are doing the same thing.", "Yes, YTA.  There are a lot of issues to unravel here, but you're asking about one specific one, and the right way to handle it would simply to have mentioned it to the couple, possibly is some sort of joking way... \"Heheh listen, you know, back when we were young maybe we could've kept up with you, but anyway, notwithstanding you guys are having a great time, we're older and like to sleep more. If possible, you know, tone it down a notch or two\" -- or something like that.\n\nTaking it to a 3rd-party because of your own insecurities really is an AH move. Deal with your own problems like an adult, and take it up a level if you actually need to. And jeez, not telling your husband about it and letting him face the wrath? You created a big mess and ruined your vacation.", "YTA. You really need to focus on your marriage and not this happy couple. I think they\u2019re a lot of deeper issues here, definitely not just you tattling on the couple next door. Based on your husbands behavior it seems like he\u2019s getting fed up in all honestly, and if I were you I definitely be more worried about trying to get to the root of that.", "YTA, sorry.\n\nYour husband is the *biggest* asshole present, but you're taking out your frustrations on innocent bystanders. It's not the younger lady's fault that your husband is an inappropriate horndog. It's not their fault that your vacation isn't having the restorative effect you were hoping for. And honestly, I don't think the main issue is that they're having sex. The main issue is that your husband sounds terrible, and he's making you feel terrible, and you're searching for a reason to be feeling terrible that isn't the doom of your longstanding relationship.", "ESH. Why not ask to change rooms? I can't help but wonder if your tolerance for your neighbors would be higher if things were better between you and your husband. Your husband is the AH for trying to blame you for his angry behavior, which seems to pre-date your going to the front desk. If this were a movie, it would be the moment that the couple realizes that the relationship can't be saved (at least not with anything \"fun\" versus painful honesty and hard work in therapy).", "YTA you're frustrated with your marriage and lack of intimacy and you took it out on the other couple. That's not going to improve your own situation.", "Meh - you should have ideally asked for a room swap rather than complain about a couple enjoying their holiday in the way you had wished to enjoy yours. Perhaps you snapped out of frustration from what you are missing in your own relationship.\n\nSounds like yourself and your husband need couples counselling and sex therapy. If there are issues in the relationship (which I assume there are) then that will obviously impact your sexual desire for each other. It is hard to find someone sexually attractive (regardless of what they objectively look like) if you hold resentment for them.", "ESH\n\nI feel awful for you after reading all of that. Your husband is behaving terribly and it is obvious that your marriage is going through a rough patch which has made you miserable. Taking that into account I think you yourself know that you only complained about the people next door because their happiness upset you, if you were enjoying life you would hardly have noticed them.\nIt\u2019s not really about that though is it?\n\nI hope your marriage improves and your husband takes a long hard look at himself and his behaviour because the way you write about it is upsetting even to an outsider.  Everybody deserves better than that from their partner and themselves.", "YTA.. it\u2019s part of the territory in hotels that you might hear other people like that.

Happy people on a foreign vacation fornicate every day.  Don't try to spread your misery around.", "ESH. You let your jealousy for that young couples relationship which is still passionate and fun, cause you to try and spoil things for them. I understand feeling insecure, and I understand this isn't the trip you wanted, but I think you could have approached this differently. \n\nYour husband sucks for not making more effort with your relationship and not trying to rekindle the romance, and yes, he sucks for leaving you all day, but the more of your post I read, the more I wondered why you are still together and trying to force intimacy that just isn't there anymore. \n\nTo a much lesser degree I do think the young couple suck a little for being so loud, but honestly it's a romantic trip and while they could keep it down a little, they are entitled to their fun! \n\nI think you need to seriously consider whether your marriage is still working.", "YTA...you've just ruined that couples holiday by trying to rekindle your own relationship...\nCouples that go on holiday tend to have sex and just really enjoy being in love and let loose. You've basically shamed them for doing so. \nIf you didn't want to hear any noise then you should have booked a private airb&b or something because it sounds like your not very used to be in hotels \ud83d\ude36 \nAnd your relationship sounds like it's done. No holiday or complaint is going to fix it. There's resentment there and yous are clinging on by a thread.

His replies and comments are cruel, to say the least.", "I have mixwd feelings about this, but essentially, OP YTA. If the holiday had gone the way you planned you would have been the ones annying the guests in the next room with your nightly activities.\n\nIf you feel like losing some dead weight, then you should get rid of that husband of yours, he doesn't sound like a good partner to you.", "Jeez there\u2019s a lot of hate on here. All the best OP, I\u2019m sorry your husband compares you to others like that, it\u2019s not cool and must feel terrible. Obviously this has way more to do with your marriage than the other couple, and I hope you can work things out.", "As far as the other couple goes, you don't get to complain about them having sex. They're in a luxury resort. Like you said about the topless woman, that's just what to expect there. The hotel should have better walls, and you should include that in a review if you think it was a detrimental part of your experience there! Your husband, however, sounds like he resents you for your weight gain and the sexual issues in your relationship. You two could use some couples therapy/marriage counseling to address the problems in the relationship, and if things don't improve, as other people have noted you may be looking at the beginning of the end with him.", "YTA\n\nThis trip was doomed from the start. There is just too much pressure on both of you in that situation for things to magically just be better. And FWIW, it sounds like the trip was already a bust before that couple showed up next door. They just became a scapegoat for your frustrations. \n\nInsecurity can be toxic and TBH I can't tell if your husband is just a jerk or if he was a guy who was walking on eggshells to be sensitive to you and lost patience when doing his best didn't improve the situation and your jealousy got out of hand. It sounds like it took some badgering to get him to blow up like that.\n\nAnd I'm not unsympathetic to your insecurities. I just think you need therapy or couples counseling. Wishing things better won't help. You need to do some real work.", "YTA, exclusively regarding your question in the caption, miss. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThe thing here is you reported them due to jealousy, mainly. And I think you\u2019re aware of this. If you had done it because they were just too loud, the proper thing would have been talking to them. But that was not the case, nor the motivation.\n\nAnother bigger thing: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH SUCH A DISRESPECTFUL ASSHOLE? Kick his ass out of your life and start taking care of yourself, miss.", "Is anyone else surprised that a five star resort wouldn\u2019t have somewhat better soundproofing? \n\nAnyway OP, you said that up until now it\u2019s been your *husband* bitching about the hotel: \u201cthe hotel, the staff, the food and the other guests.\u201d Oh, plus he\u2019s told you to your face that he doesn\u2019t find you attractive. So. What DOES he like? Perving on the young woman next door. You think she didn\u2019t notice. Trust me, she did. She just ignored him because she probably has lots of practice dealing with creeps. \n\nBasically your marriage is toxic. Dude man is perving on young women and you\u2019re mad at the young women for it. Sure, seems fair. \n\nLet this be your wake up call. You\u2019re turning into someone you don\u2019t want to be. Are the high end vacations (with a man who complains the whole time) really worth being treated with contempt?  Right now you and hubby are TA.

I think this was blown way up.\n\nYall def have a marriage problem. Your husband is being really disrespectful openly lusting and essentially flirting with someone in front of you. He tells you that he loves you but isn't attracted to you. That's a huge blow in a relationship. Then him leaving you all day just because you called the concierge and \"embarrassed\" him. It's not that serious.\n\nYall are in a beautiful resort alone for 10 days and had sex once? Sheesh. What the couple is doing next door is what most couples do on vacay.\n\nIf it were me, I'd start to focus on myself cuz 100 pounds in three years really is alot. Focus on you and being healthy. Do more self care. Then either marriage counseling or reconsidering your relationship.", "Wrong sub. And ESH\n\nYour husband for telling you how much more attractive he finds girl next door. Albeit true he mustn't necessarily rub this into your face like that. Why are you still with this guy? And then he leaves you alone all day when you both discussed the hike and said you wouldn't go... \n\nCouple next door... To have sex while on vacation is normal. To have loud sex also quite normal. To have loud sex in the middle of night and waking up others not OK. \n\nYou. Firstly to yourself. Again why are you still with this guy? Secondly for taking out your anger and frustration on couple next door. It's not their fault they are still young and happy and you are not.

Whether you do or not is entirely up to you.", "Your jealousy is less attractive than any weight you gained and your husband seems a complete jerk.

It\u2019s a hotel, and people are on vacation. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re not getting busy, but other people shouldn\u2019t be shamed because they are, but even more than that, it feels very much like you also were being spiteful because you\u2019ve decided your husband is hot for the woman next door. You\u2019re punishing them, your husband, and yourself because of your own insecurities.\n\nI can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that your husband needed a break, but honestly, you both sound like you\u2019re miserable in your relationship.

You to the couple next door for clearly being jealous of the marriage and vacation they\u2019re having and your husband for clearly insulting you and acting childish.

You need to deal with your problems and not ruin someone else's vacation by your envy.", "Yta, it sounds like you took out your frustration of your marriage on this couple. \n\nSit down your husband and have a talk about the state of your marriage. It sounds like you guys should maybe take a break.", "YTA\n\nNot their problem that you guys can\u2019t get it on while they seem to manage.

Youre clearly just jealous.", "YTA I mean they paid to be there just like you? It\u2019s not their fault you and hubby aren\u2019t as in to sex with each other as they are. I do not understand what you were thinking. Sounds like envy to me", "YTA, first time in a hotel there, champ?", "YTA - you should have been grown up about it and spoke to them but if I'm honest i think it was partly done out of spite", "A lot going on here, but to start you are NTA for complaining to hotel management. That is literally their job. I'm assuming this vacation is extremely expensive and you went to enjoy yourself. If you are not enjoying yourself, you have the right to a room change. Instead of speaking to the couple next door, the hotel should have just moved you. They also have a right to enjoy their vacation.\n\nFurthermore, your husband is a HUGE AH for 1) taking the neighbors side instead of yours, 2) pouting like a baby instead of getting over the awkwardness with the people next door that he will literally never see again, and mostly importantly 3) making you feel self conscious about your body. You deserve so much more. I hope this vacation has made you aware of that.\n\nBest of luck to you <3", "I can\u2019t call anyone an AH because your marriage sounds like mine\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re in a tough spot, and you\u2019re reminded of your insecurities and the tears in your relationship at every turn with this couple next door. It reminds both of you of what once was between you, and what glaringly isn\u2019t.\n\nThe way you talk about your husband makes me so sad because I know exactly what you mean. The complaining, the nitpicking, and then befriending everyone else in sight. It pisses you off when it seems like they hate everything with you, but somehow put on a good face for others. But it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s your perception or not because at this point everything is annoying.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have left like that. That was a crappy move. You talking to the desk was fine. They were being disruptive if you could hear them in the middle of the night.\n\nI hope you guys can get through this. It\u2019s such a crappy place to be in for your relationship.", "YTA.  So is your husband, but he didn't spoil someone else's vacation.", "Uh... NTA, being kept up at night because people have no consideration for their neighbors (whether by sex, partying, or whatever) makes them assholes.\n\nBut uh. Taking an expensive vacation to rekindle a relationship isn't going to work unless both people are actually *also* working on the relationship. It kinda sounds like you both went on vacation, hoping it would magically work, and it's no wonder you're both disappointed. Couples therapy?", "YTA, but really, you both need some counciling to get though this.\n\nYou could have just gotten some earplugs...", "YTA\n\nWhy don\u2019t you lose weight? If you know weight is an issue for you two then why don\u2019t you do something about it? \n\nMy wife works hard at work, home, and the gym. No reason to just give up on your appearance. For that reason, I am always bugging her lol. If we weren\u2019t always busy we\u2019d probably have sex nightly even after all these years. I love her and she loves me.", "NTA, I am of the opinion that people should be considerate of others and they weren't.... They are on holiday to enjoy themselves, but so are you and can enjoy your sleep...\nLeaving aside your obviously rude husband who was clearly enjoying the free show.\nBtw...no, it is not standard to sunbath top less in Europe.

He's inventing all these other problems with the room and the guests and the staff because it allows him to vent his real frustration on something unrelated (like OP did with the other couple). It may also be a way to him to pretend to be in a \"bad mood\" so he can get out of having sex without blaming his wife.\n\nUnless he's always been this insensitive and petty, it's likely that being trapped in a hotel room for nine days with someone with wildly different expectations for what they'd be doing led to a pressure cooker of resentment and discomfort.

None of that is the husband's fault. \n\nRelationships need work, including self-work. Allowing yourself to gain 100lbs (45kg!!) and expecting husband to be fine with that and still find you physically and psychologically appealing is foolishness.

I think their relationship still has hope: hubby has clearly taken the effort to organise a holiday with OP to rekindle things. It shows effort on his part.\n\nThe holiday hasn't been the honeymoon they imagined, but issues in their relationship that have been suppressed have come to the surface, and it is an opportunity to deal with them. For her part, OP needs to (1) commit to starting diet and exercise and work towards a healthy weight, (2) deal with her insecurities on this front, (3) grapple with the relationship, in concert with her husband, as a team. \n\nThe couple next door is at a different phase (honeymoon lust), it shouldn't become a distraction or the standard by which OP and hubby judge their relationship.", "How is the husband an Asshole at all???

This is incredibly significant on someone\u2019s appearance. To disregard the logic in this is strange. This wasn\u2019t over 2 decades of marriage. This was 3 years.

Let\u2019s say she had the sickness that makes you gain 100 pounds in 3 years. Should he still be sexually attracted to her because the weight gain was from illness not from life choices? I can imagine it\u2019s pretty difficult to finally tell someone you love deeply why you\u2019ve essentially been avoiding them sexually. And to say \u201cI love you but I\u2019m not sexually attracted to you\u201d perhaps isn\u2019t the BEST way to do it but it\u2019s definitely not the worst and there\u2019s no perfect or even good way to bring this up.", "So instead of using the information we have you\u2019d prefer to add additional made up information to discredit my point? Yep, this is reddit.", "We're definitely not gonna agree on this because I don't find that reasonable at all.

That comment had nothing to do with the story and she's so upset by it that she's still bringing it into their current arguments, where he continues to make digs at her for her weight.\n\nWe don't know if her weight gain is because of a medical or mental issue, we don't know if she ever made appointments with doctors or therapists to find out why she's gained all this weight. But if you want me to play into your hypothetical that she does have a medical issue that causes weight gain, then saying \"im not sexually attracted to you anymore\" is an even worse statement. What would be the point of saying that to your spouse if they can't control it? All you're doing is hurting them.", "This is Reddit. Most of the stories are made up.", "Maybe it is a selfish comment by him. Gaining all that weight in such a short amount of time and expecting your partner not to have an issue (AGAIN BARRING THESE POTENTIAL PESKY MEDICAL ISSUES) with it/being sad when the reality you already knew is actually said outloud to you is selfish. She looks completely different. It really really isn\u2019t his job as a supportive partner to tell her it\u2019s ok if she gains 100 more pounds and she\u2019s so fucking hot. 3 years ago she was skinny. Or at least 100 pounds lighter. Now she\u2019s fat. Or at least 100 pounds heavier. But hey the person who has sex with her and had the reasonable (that word again) expectation that she wouldn\u2019t transform in 36 months (or even a shorter time frame based on the year ago statement) into a drastically different appearance should just not have any issues. You\u2019re correct we won\u2019t agree on this. But I see and understand your points."]}
