We were both drunk, and I think we both forced it a bit. We get on great as people, but our sex life has been an issue since we had children. \n\nThis has only gotten worse since last year my husband told me he 'loves me but doesn't find me attractive sexually anymore' which was upsetting and hurtful as in the past three years I have gained over 100lbs.\n\nWe are staying in an amazing 5 star resort, the hotel rooms has its own small pool and terrace to sit out on.

Since they have arrived we have heard them having sex more or less twice a day, in addition when they are sat on the terrace they are kissing and all over each other, in addition the woman next door is sunbathing topless. I know we are in Europe and thats the norm but I find it hard to get use to.\n\nMy husband quickly befriended them over the balcony, and truthfully I think lusting over the woman next door.

I went and asked the concierge if they could ask them to keep it down.\n\nObviously having been told something, last night the man next door angrily told my husband if he had an issue he should of said something directly. My husband did not know I had reported it, and we then argued all yesterday evening.\n\nMy husband called me ridiculous and a prude and that if I was 'more carefree' we wouldn't have any issues.

You let your jealousy and insecurity get the better of you. You weren't happy with how your vacation is going and took it out on a couple for being happy and doing what people do in hotels.", "YTA - it aint the neighbors you have a problem with hunny.  \n\nYeah sure, asked to be moved rooms as you can hear the nieghbors... all night long... but it is not your husbands fault the neighbors seem nice.  \n\nY'all got big ol issues and a 12 day vacation probably wont fix anything. What it will do is make the issues bubble to the surface so you can deal with them.  \n\nHave some drinks, get some sun, find a book, relax, - the nieghbors are doing the same thing.", "Yes, YTA.  There are a lot of issues to unravel here, but you're asking about one specific one, and the right way to handle it would simply to have mentioned it to the couple, possibly is some sort of joking way... \"Heheh listen, you know, back when we were young maybe we could've kept up with you, but anyway, notwithstanding you guys are having a great time, we're older and like to sleep more. If possible, you know, tone it down a notch or two\" -- or something like that.\n\nTaking it to a 3rd-party because of your own insecurities really is an AH move. Deal with your own problems like an adult, and take it up a level if you actually need to. And jeez, not telling your husband about it and letting him face the wrath? You created a big mess and ruined your vacation.", "YTA. You really need to focus on your marriage and not this happy couple. I think they\u2019re a lot of deeper issues here, definitely not just you tattling on the couple next door. Based on your husbands behavior it seems like he\u2019s getting fed up in all honestly, and if I were you I definitely be more worried about trying to get to the root of that.", "YTA, sorry.\n\nYour husband is the *biggest* asshole present, but you're taking out your frustrations on innocent bystanders. It's not the younger lady's fault that your husband is an inappropriate horndog. It's not their fault that your vacation isn't having the restorative effect you were hoping for. And honestly, I don't think the main issue is that they're having sex. The main issue is that your husband sounds terrible, and he's making you feel terrible, and you're searching for a reason to be feeling terrible that isn't the doom of your longstanding relationship.", "ESH. Why not ask to change rooms? I can't help but wonder if your tolerance for your neighbors would be higher if things were better between you and your husband. Your husband is the AH for trying to blame you for his angry behavior, which seems to pre-date your going to the front desk. If this were a movie, it would be the moment that the couple realizes that the relationship can't be saved (at least not with anything \"fun\" versus painful honesty and hard work in therapy).", "YTA you're frustrated with your marriage and lack of intimacy and you took it out on the other couple. That's not going to improve your own situation.", "Meh - you should have ideally asked for a room swap rather than complain about a couple enjoying their holiday in the way you had wished to enjoy yours. Perhaps you snapped out of frustration from what you are missing in your own relationship.\n\nSounds like yourself and your husband need couples counselling and sex therapy. If there are issues in the relationship (which I assume there are) then that will obviously impact your sexual desire for each other. It is hard to find someone sexually attractive (regardless of what they objectively look like) if you hold resentment for them.", "ESH\n\nI feel awful for you after reading all of that. Your husband is behaving terribly and it is obvious that your marriage is going through a rough patch which has made you miserable. Taking that into account I think you yourself know that you only complained about the people next door because their happiness upset you, if you were enjoying life you would hardly have noticed them.\nIt\u2019s not really about that though is it?\n\nI hope your marriage improves and your husband takes a long hard look at himself and his behaviour because the way you write about it is upsetting even to an outsider.  Everybody deserves better than that from their partner and themselves.", "YTA.. it\u2019s part of the territory in hotels that you might hear other people like that.

Happy people on a foreign vacation fornicate every day.  Don't try to spread your misery around.", "ESH. You let your jealousy for that young couples relationship which is still passionate and fun, cause you to try and spoil things for them. I understand feeling insecure, and I understand this isn't the trip you wanted, but I think you could have approached this differently. \n\nYour husband sucks for not making more effort with your relationship and not trying to rekindle the romance, and yes, he sucks for leaving you all day, but the more of your post I read, the more I wondered why you are still together and trying to force intimacy that just isn't there anymore. \n\nTo a much lesser degree I do think the young couple suck a little for being so loud, but honestly it's a romantic trip and while they could keep it down a little, they are entitled to their fun! \n\nI think you need to seriously consider whether your marriage is still working.", "YTA...you've just ruined that couples holiday by trying to rekindle your own relationship...\nCouples that go on holiday tend to have sex and just really enjoy being in love and let loose. You've basically shamed them for doing so. \nIf you didn't want to hear any noise then you should have booked a private airb&b or something because it sounds like your not very used to be in hotels \ud83d\ude36 \nAnd your relationship sounds like it's done. No holiday or complaint is going to fix it. There's resentment there and yous are clinging on by a thread.

His replies and comments are cruel, to say the least.", "I have mixwd feelings about this, but essentially, OP YTA. If the holiday had gone the way you planned you would have been the ones annying the guests in the next room with your nightly activities.\n\nIf you feel like losing some dead weight, then you should get rid of that husband of yours, he doesn't sound like a good partner to you.", "Jeez there\u2019s a lot of hate on here. All the best OP, I\u2019m sorry your husband compares you to others like that, it\u2019s not cool and must feel terrible. Obviously this has way more to do with your marriage than the other couple, and I hope you can work things out.", "As far as the other couple goes, you don't get to complain about them having sex. They're in a luxury resort. Like you said about the topless woman, that's just what to expect there. The hotel should have better walls, and you should include that in a review if you think it was a detrimental part of your experience there! Your husband, however, sounds like he resents you for your weight gain and the sexual issues in your relationship. You two could use some couples therapy/marriage counseling to address the problems in the relationship, and if things don't improve, as other people have noted you may be looking at the beginning of the end with him.", "YTA\n\nThis trip was doomed from the start. There is just too much pressure on both of you in that situation for things to magically just be better. And FWIW, it sounds like the trip was already a bust before that couple showed up next door. They just became a scapegoat for your frustrations. \n\nInsecurity can be toxic and TBH I can't tell if your husband is just a jerk or if he was a guy who was walking on eggshells to be sensitive to you and lost patience when doing his best didn't improve the situation and your jealousy got out of hand. It sounds like it took some badgering to get him to blow up like that.\n\nAnd I'm not unsympathetic to your insecurities. I just think you need therapy or couples counseling. Wishing things better won't help. You need to do some real work.", "YTA, exclusively regarding your question in the caption, miss. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThe thing here is you reported them due to jealousy, mainly. And I think you\u2019re aware of this. If you had done it because they were just too loud, the proper thing would have been talking to them. But that was not the case, nor the motivation.\n\nAnother bigger thing: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH SUCH A DISRESPECTFUL ASSHOLE? Kick his ass out of your life and start taking care of yourself, miss.", "Is anyone else surprised that a five star resort wouldn\u2019t have somewhat better soundproofing? \n\nAnyway OP, you said that up until now it\u2019s been your *husband* bitching about the hotel: \u201cthe hotel, the staff, the food and the other guests.\u201d Oh, plus he\u2019s told you to your face that he doesn\u2019t find you attractive. So. What DOES he like? Perving on the young woman next door. You think she didn\u2019t notice. Trust me, she did. She just ignored him because she probably has lots of practice dealing with creeps. \n\nBasically your marriage is toxic. Dude man is perving on young women and you\u2019re mad at the young women for it. Sure, seems fair. \n\nLet this be your wake up call. You\u2019re turning into someone you don\u2019t want to be. Are the high end vacations (with a man who complains the whole time) really worth being treated with contempt?  Right now you and hubby are TA.

I think this was blown way up.\n\nYall def have a marriage problem. Your husband is being really disrespectful openly lusting and essentially flirting with someone in front of you. He tells you that he loves you but isn't attracted to you. That's a huge blow in a relationship. Then him leaving you all day just because you called the concierge and \"embarrassed\" him. It's not that serious.\n\nYall are in a beautiful resort alone for 10 days and had sex once? Sheesh. What the couple is doing next door is what most couples do on vacay.\n\nIf it were me, I'd start to focus on myself cuz 100 pounds in three years really is alot. Focus on you and being healthy. Do more self care. Then either marriage counseling or reconsidering your relationship.", "Wrong sub. And ESH\n\nYour husband for telling you how much more attractive he finds girl next door. Albeit true he mustn't necessarily rub this into your face like that. Why are you still with this guy? And then he leaves you alone all day when you both discussed the hike and said you wouldn't go... \n\nCouple next door... To have sex while on vacation is normal. To have loud sex also quite normal. To have loud sex in the middle of night and waking up others not OK. \n\nYou. Firstly to yourself. Again why are you still with this guy? Secondly for taking out your anger and frustration on couple next door. It's not their fault they are still young and happy and you are not.

Whether you do or not is entirely up to you.", "Your jealousy is less attractive than any weight you gained and your husband seems a complete jerk.

It\u2019s a hotel, and people are on vacation. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re not getting busy, but other people shouldn\u2019t be shamed because they are, but even more than that, it feels very much like you also were being spiteful because you\u2019ve decided your husband is hot for the woman next door. You\u2019re punishing them, your husband, and yourself because of your own insecurities.\n\nI can\u2019t pretend to be surprised that your husband needed a break, but honestly, you both sound like you\u2019re miserable in your relationship.

You to the couple next door for clearly being jealous of the marriage and vacation they\u2019re having and your husband for clearly insulting you and acting childish.

You need to deal with your problems and not ruin someone else's vacation by your envy.", "Yta, it sounds like you took out your frustration of your marriage on this couple. \n\nSit down your husband and have a talk about the state of your marriage. It sounds like you guys should maybe take a break.", "YTA\n\nNot their problem that you guys can\u2019t get it on while they seem to manage.

Youre clearly just jealous.", "YTA I mean they paid to be there just like you? It\u2019s not their fault you and hubby aren\u2019t as in to sex with each other as they are. I do not understand what you were thinking. Sounds like envy to me", "YTA, first time in a hotel there, champ?", "YTA - you should have been grown up about it and spoke to them but if I'm honest i think it was partly done out of spite", "A lot going on here, but to start you are NTA for complaining to hotel management. That is literally their job. I'm assuming this vacation is extremely expensive and you went to enjoy yourself. If you are not enjoying yourself, you have the right to a room change. Instead of speaking to the couple next door, the hotel should have just moved you. They also have a right to enjoy their vacation.\n\nFurthermore, your husband is a HUGE AH for 1) taking the neighbors side instead of yours, 2) pouting like a baby instead of getting over the awkwardness with the people next door that he will literally never see again, and mostly importantly 3) making you feel self conscious about your body. You deserve so much more. I hope this vacation has made you aware of that.\n\nBest of luck to you <3", "I can\u2019t call anyone an AH because your marriage sounds like mine\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re in a tough spot, and you\u2019re reminded of your insecurities and the tears in your relationship at every turn with this couple next door. It reminds both of you of what once was between you, and what glaringly isn\u2019t.\n\nThe way you talk about your husband makes me so sad because I know exactly what you mean. The complaining, the nitpicking, and then befriending everyone else in sight. It pisses you off when it seems like they hate everything with you, but somehow put on a good face for others. But it\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s your perception or not because at this point everything is annoying.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have left like that. That was a crappy move. You talking to the desk was fine. They were being disruptive if you could hear them in the middle of the night.\n\nI hope you guys can get through this. It\u2019s such a crappy place to be in for your relationship.", "YTA.  So is your husband, but he didn't spoil someone else's vacation.", "Uh... NTA, being kept up at night because people have no consideration for their neighbors (whether by sex, partying, or whatever) makes them assholes.\n\nBut uh. Taking an expensive vacation to rekindle a relationship isn't going to work unless both people are actually *also* working on the relationship. It kinda sounds like you both went on vacation, hoping it would magically work, and it's no wonder you're both disappointed. Couples therapy?", "YTA, but really, you both need some counciling to get though this.\n\nYou could have just gotten some earplugs...", "YTA\n\nWhy don\u2019t you lose weight? If you know weight is an issue for you two then why don\u2019t you do something about it? \n\nMy wife works hard at work, home, and the gym. No reason to just give up on your appearance. For that reason, I am always bugging her lol. If we weren\u2019t always busy we\u2019d probably have sex nightly even after all these years. I love her and she loves me.", "NTA, I am of the opinion that people should be considerate of others and they weren't.... They are on holiday to enjoy themselves, but so are you and can enjoy your sleep...\nLeaving aside your obviously rude husband who was clearly enjoying the free show.\nBtw...no, it is not standard to sunbath top less in Europe.

No difference than being gay, some people are just not attracted to certain things.", "For like a billion reasons, but about five big ones.\n\nFirst, there's the fact that her husband is apparently needling her about her appearance to the point that she's internalized it as a personal failing.\n\nSecondly, the husband has apparently spent the entire vacation finding fault with, and I quote, \"nearly everything, the hotel, the staff, the food and the other guests.\"\n\nThirdly, in the middle of their argument her husband blamed all of the problems in either their vacation or their relationship (not entirely clear) on OP through the \"if you were more carefree we wouldn't have any issues\" line, rather than taking issue with the actual problem, which was her going to the concierge instead of directly to the couple to deal with a fairly minor problem.\n\nFourthly, there's the fact that when she called her husband on behaving inappropriately with the younger lady next door, his response was \"it's natural for me to lust after her because she's hot\", rather than any kind of admission that this is not, actually, appropriate behavior towards any woman, let alone a much younger one, let directly alone in front of your wife, let alone directly in front of your wife that you're deliberately calling ugly a lot.\n\nFinally, there's the fact that when called on the fact that openly slobbering at another woman in front of his wife was making her feel bad, his response was to get huffy and go to bed mad, and then to sneak off the next morning to do a private event without his wife, and upon his return he's continued to try to punish her  rather than trying to resolve the dispute.", "Right", "Also, and this might be an extremely little thing or it might be an extremely big thing, but I can't help but notice that OP's weight gain directly ties to the early days of the pandemic, which means that there's a good chance that it's connected to a major change in either health or routine based on everything in the goddamn world getting turned upside down, and that's a prime time to be supportive of your spouse instead of blaming them for the world going awry.", "YTA.  You are projecting your insecurities on someone else.", "YTA since they did nothing wrong.\n\nHow fat did your husband get since you met him?", "YTA. Pull the stick out of your ass and get laid.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking out your frustrations of your loveless marriage out on the happy couple next door harmlessly enjoying their vacation.

Does your husband suck, I'd day yes, but that's not the question being asked and you know it.\n\n That couple is also enjoying their vacation, if you have a problem with what your husband is doing  sit him down and talk to him about it, don't take out your insecurities and frustrations on the couple who's enjoying their vaction", "ESH\n\nThis is not about the Iranian yogurt. \n\nA gentle knock knock on the wall would have let your neighbors know they were being a little too loud. (Obviously I wasn't there but if it woke OP up, it seems reasonable to describe it as a little too loud. )\n\nYour issue is with your husband and your marriage.

Maybe together and individually.", "You guys don't even have kids with you and you're stressing about your attractive neighbors screwing? The way you've written this indicates your jealousy at every step, your husband clearly wants to fornicate and you're the one having issues seeing yourself as a sexual being. YTA, he's a jerk for saying what he did abt the neighbor but we all have eyes, and he was honest enough not to pretend being blind to her. Because he loves you and wants to have sex with you. Which is what you guys went on vacation to do, and now you're taking issue with people on vacation for the same reasons. You both need therapy, maybe couple's counseling if you actually want to confront your issues and insecurities. Doesn't sound like it so far, though.", "YTA. A giant one. Just because you\u2019re unhappy with yourself & your relationship doesn\u2019t mean everyone around you has to be miserable too.", "YTA. I'll have to defend your husband as everyone seems to go at him way too much. Of course, I don't know anything about him as a person so take it as you will.\n\nTo me he is sexually frustrated. He sounds depressed and grumpy. He envies the guy who is having the time of his life. This is not him being an asshole but the result of not having his needs met.\n\nYour weight might be a factor but most likely something else is going on. Was he at some point much hornier than you and ended up being rejected a lot? Does he favour porn over you? Was he asking you for anything for years before he told you he is not into you anymore?", "You are gonna need a divorce lawyer", "YTA.

When you stay in a hotel you need to be respectful of other guests. Have all the sex you want, yelling during it doesnt change how it feels. It is NOT okay to wake other guests up whether you are drunk or having sex. Maybe if your dog randomly barks or cries and you fix the issue right away since you cant control that. Your husband fucking sucks. And neither of you are putting in the work to honestly make your marriage last.\n\nBut NTA. You asked for help from the hotel management and they fucked up by going to the other guests instead of moving your room. Which would have also solved the husband ogling issue.", "ESH\n\nYou for making your jealousy into a complaint \n\nHim for being an awful person \n\nJust accept that your marriage is over, split everything 50/50 and go have a nice life for goodness sake.\n\nAlso you can\u2019t put on 100lbs and not expect it to ruin your marriage.  Every time you over ate you were choosing your selfish pleasure over your marriage.", "Oof! YTA\u2026young couple on vacation doing what couples do. You would learn a couple things from them.\n\nThink about going to sex therapist. It sounds weird but could definitely help out the sex life.", "NTA\nNobody has the right to be so loud that they disturb your sleep in a hotel. The appropriate thing to do is to speak to hotel staff. It is the hotel staffs job to take care of such complaints, you should never do it yourself because you don't know what will happen. The way the man handled it with your husband points this out. The appropriate response would have been for him to apologize and promise for it not to happen again. \n\nYour marriage is a whole other mess...I don't even know what to say about that. I hope you find some self-love and self-respect and leave your husband. It's quite clear this marriage is well over.", "YTA. \n\nThis clearly isn't about the neighbors.

OP should be focusing on working on herself, for more important reasons than her marriage or sex life. She is in all likelihood outright obese at this point and cruising for a multitude of health issues. 100lbs on the average female frame is a LOT", "Apparently misery does love company! YTA let the other couple have their fun", "The husband also sucks for oogling the neighbour and comparing OP to her. You know (you just *know*) he befriended them so he could spend more time around the young hot woman. My ex did the same thing to me on vacation to the point where the other couple would try to actively avoid him, but he\u2019d spot them across the beach and leave me alone with our stuff, or see them in the restaurants and purposely sit next to them and ignore me. He actually was cheating on me through our entire relationship. It\u2019s obvious that OP\u2019s husband has checked out of the relationship. She needs to move on and find someone that will find her attractive as she is and love her.", "Husband could definitely be called an ass for openly lusting over the neighbor, but is he really an ass for not putting serious effort into \u201crekindling the romance\u201d? Unless OP is like, half a dozen standard deviations over average female height, she is now morbidly obese. Not many people outside of fetishists will be able to find someone that size sexually attractive", ">Your husband sucks for not making more effort with your relationship and not trying to rekindle the romance\n\nHe has made it clear what stands between them and a happy sex life. It's the same thing that stands between her and being healthy. It's something only one of the two can change, and that's not him. He is not to blame for not finding obese women attractive. \n\nWhat has she done to work on that problem?", "I bet the husband would have been livid if she asked to change rooms bc then he wouldn\u2019t have his eye candy right next door, and the sex sounds to go masturbate to in the bathroom. \ud83d\udcafhe would have gone hiking the next day without OP. She was pretty much damned either way.", "Right? I dont understand why the conceierge talked to the couple instead of changing rooms. Thats not OP's fault. Thats bad management.", "It\u2019s a five star hotel. If I pay lots of money to stay in such a resort I expect that I can have as much sex in my room as I want. And it\u2019s absolutely standard that women sunbath topless across Europw except for countries like Turkey. Here in Germany no one would bat an eye at a topless woman at the beach, same goes for Spain, Italy, Portugal, the UK, the Benelux countries, France and all of Scandinavia", "I\u2019m not sure how noticing someone is young and attractive is an insult to someone who isn\u2019t young or attractive.", "Are we reading the same text? I can't find any insensitive comment about OPs weight?", "So you've never noticed that someone is attractive even though you're in a committed relationship? It's not like he acted on it or used it against OP in anyway, she was the one who brought it up.", "Considering he has made multiple comments on her weight and has told her he is no longer attracted to her because of her weight, it\u2019s fairly clear this was a dig at her.

If you think it is, then you shouldn't get married. Besides that, this younger woman probably doesn't want to be ogled by strangers. The husband is disrespectful of his wife and this other woman. Again, it's not hard not to stare at people.", "Multiple comments about her weight?  I see one where he expressed lack of attraction because she gained significant weight.  The second she asked if he thought the hot neighbor was hot.", "I would never, ever, get angry at my girlfriend for answering truthfully if I asked her if some dude was hot. That would be so cruel. If I was so insecure about myself, I would never force her into an position where she either has to lie to me or hurt my feelings.", "If your married you are not allowed to notice other people who are attractive?   She asked. He answered.  Would you prefer he lie?  Neither she or he want to be with him or her.   They are both miserable people. I wonder how sympathetic you would be if he divorced his wife because she gained weight.", "Ok, but it\u2019s not just \u201chey do you think our neighbour is hot\u201d and he said yes - that would be fair. This seems like it was in a middle of a heated argument where he called her ridiculous and a prude, and she complained that he had been checking out the neighbour (reasonable to not want your SO to be openly checking out another person in front of you, although maybe the timing of this complaint could have been better) and then he invalidated her hurt by doubling down on his attraction to someone else. \n\nContext is important - pretty AH behaviour when considering everything else. He did not give a rats ass about her feelings in this argument. With friends (or spouses) like that, who needs enemies?", "Except she didn\u2019t ask? She simply called him out on how inappropriate it was for him to be ogling a younger woman who is also taken when he is supposed to be focusing on finding more attraction for his wife. He decided to be cruel and give details as to why he was justified in his creepiness."]}
