Part of the reason we have taken this trip is to 'rekindle the relationship'. This is a two week trip and we are on day 9, for context we have had sex once. We were both drunk, and I think we both forced it a bit. We get on great as people, but our sex life has been an issue since we had children.\n\nThis has only gotten worse since last year my husband told me he 'loves me but doesn't find me attractive sexually anymore' which was upsetting and hurtful as in the past three years I have gained over 100lbs.\n\nWe are staying in an amazing 5 star resort, the hotel rooms has its own small pool and terrace to sit out on. Since we arrived my husband has found issue with nearly everything, the hotel, the staff, the food and the other guests.\n\nFive days ago in the room next door a young British couple took the room. For context they are both very attractive, if I found out they were instagram models or something I would not be shocked.\n\nThe issue is each room shares a wall with another room, and we share a room and a lower balcony where we can see there terrace with this couple. Since they have arrived we have heard them having sex more or less twice a day, in addition when they are sat on the terrace they are kissing and all over each other, in addition the woman next door is sunbathing topless. I know we are in Europe and thats the norm but I find it hard to get use to.\n\nMy husband quickly befriended them over the balcony, and truthfully I think lusting over the woman next door. Who I think was oblivious to this. I have also spoken to them both and they seem nice.\n\nAfter being woken in the middle of the night two nights ago to the sound of them having sex, and again that morning. I went and asked the concierge if they could ask them to keep it down.\n\nObviously having been told something, last night the man next door angrily told my husband if he had an issue he should of said something directly. My husband did not know I had reported it, and we then argued all yesterday evening.\n\nMy husband called me ridiculous and a prude and that if I was 'more carefree' we wouldn't have any issues. I also brought up his obvious like of the woman next door and he angrily said 'why wouldn't I, she is young, thin and hot' which was an obvious dig of what I am not. He then angrily walked around the hotel room before going to sleep in silence.\n\nThis morning I woke up to a text that he had gone to hike up a hill/mountain - this takes all day and we had decided earlier in the trip we wouldn't do it. Since he returned we have hardly spoken, and we were supposed to go out for dinner but he has suggested we just order room service.\n\nAITA for complaining about the couple next door? or is he the asshole for leaving me in the hotel all day on vacation?\n\nLooking for a bit of context if complaining about the couple next door was as bad as he is making out.\n\nEDIT - Update, thank you all for the comments. I may respond later. This wasn't a post about my weight or how attractive I have become (or not). For the sake of clarity, I have gained 100lbs since I got pregnant in 2019, around 50lb during pregnancy (I was unwell and on bed rest). The rest from from having three young children, a pandemic and working from home. I am working on loosing it. To be clear, my husband has also gained around 60lb - which I am sure is not relevant but seemed important given some of the comments.", "created_utc": 1692040934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r48ug/aita_for_complaining_about_the_couple_in_the/", "score": 3062, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What it will do is make the issues bubble to the surface so you can deal with them.  \n\nHave some drinks, get some sun, find a book, relax, - the nieghbors are doing the same thing.", "Yes, YTA.  There are a lot of issues to unravel here, but you're asking about one specific one, and the right way to handle it would simply to have mentioned it to the couple, possibly is some sort of joking way... \"Heheh listen, you know, back when we were young maybe we could've kept up with you, but anyway, notwithstanding you guys are having a great time, we're older and like to sleep more. If possible, you know, tone it down a notch or two\" -- or something like that.\n\nTaking it to a 3rd-party because of your own insecurities really is an AH move. Deal with your own problems like an adult, and take it up a level if you actually need to. And jeez, not telling your husband about it and letting him face the wrath? You created a big mess and ruined your vacation.", "YTA. You really need to focus on your marriage and not this happy couple. I think they\u2019re a lot of deeper issues here, definitely not just you tattling on the couple next door. Based on your husbands behavior it seems like he\u2019s getting fed up in all honestly, and if I were you I definitely be more worried about trying to get to the root of that.", "YTA, sorry.\n\nYour husband is the *biggest* asshole present, but you're taking out your frustrations on innocent bystanders. It's not the younger lady's fault that your husband is an inappropriate horndog. It's not their fault that your vacation isn't having the restorative effect you were hoping for.

Why not ask to change rooms? I can't help but wonder if your tolerance for your neighbors would be higher if things were better between you and your husband. Your husband is the AH for trying to blame you for his angry behavior, which seems to pre-date your going to the front desk.

That's not going to improve your own situation.", "Meh - you should have ideally asked for a room swap rather than complain about a couple enjoying their holiday in the way you had wished to enjoy yours. Perhaps you snapped out of frustration from what you are missing in your own relationship.\n\nSounds like yourself and your husband need couples counselling and sex therapy. If there are issues in the relationship (which I assume there are) then that will obviously impact your sexual desire for each other. It is hard to find someone sexually attractive (regardless of what they objectively look like) if you hold resentment for them.", "ESH\n\nI feel awful for you after reading all of that. Your husband is behaving terribly and it is obvious that your marriage is going through a rough patch which has made you miserable. Taking that into account I think you yourself know that you only complained about the people next door because their happiness upset you, if you were enjoying life you would hardly have noticed them.\nIt\u2019s not really about that though is it?\n\nI hope your marriage improves and your husband takes a long hard look at himself and his behaviour because the way you write about it is upsetting even to an outsider.  Everybody deserves better than that from their partner and themselves.", "YTA.. it\u2019s part of the territory in hotels that you might hear other people like that.

Happy people on a foreign vacation fornicate every day.  Don't try to spread your misery around.", "ESH. You let your jealousy for that young couples relationship which is still passionate and fun, cause you to try and spoil things for them. I understand feeling insecure, and I understand this isn't the trip you wanted, but I think you could have approached this differently. \n\nYour husband sucks for not making more effort with your relationship and not trying to rekindle the romance, and yes, he sucks for leaving you all day, but the more of your post I read, the more I wondered why you are still together and trying to force intimacy that just isn't there anymore. \n\nTo a much lesser degree I do think the young couple suck a little for being so loud, but honestly it's a romantic trip and while they could keep it down a little, they are entitled to their fun! \n\nI think you need to seriously consider whether your marriage is still working.", "YTA...you've just ruined that couples holiday by trying to rekindle your own relationship...\nCouples that go on holiday tend to have sex and just really enjoy being in love and let loose.

If the holiday had gone the way you planned you would have been the ones annying the guests in the next room with your nightly activities.\n\nIf you feel like losing some dead weight, then you should get rid of that husband of yours, he doesn't sound like a good partner to you.", "Jeez there\u2019s a lot of hate on here. All the best OP, I\u2019m sorry your husband compares you to others like that, it\u2019s not cool and must feel terrible. Obviously this has way more to do with your marriage than the other couple, and I hope you can work things out.", "As far as the other couple goes, you don't get to complain about them having sex. They're in a luxury resort. Like you said about the topless woman, that's just what to expect there. The hotel should have better walls, and you should include that in a review if you think it was a detrimental part of your experience there! Your husband, however, sounds like he resents you for your weight gain and the sexual issues in your relationship. You two could use some couples therapy/marriage counseling to address the problems in the relationship, and if things don't improve, as other people have noted you may be looking at the beginning of the end with him.", "YTA\n\nThis trip was doomed from the start. There is just too much pressure on both of you in that situation for things to magically just be better. And FWIW, it sounds like the trip was already a bust before that couple showed up next door. They just became a scapegoat for your frustrations. \n\nInsecurity can be toxic and TBH I can't tell if your husband is just a jerk or if he was a guy who was walking on eggshells to be sensitive to you and lost patience when doing his best didn't improve the situation and your jealousy got out of hand. It sounds like it took some badgering to get him to blow up like that.\n\nAnd I'm not unsympathetic to your insecurities. I just think you need therapy or couples counseling.

I\u2019m sorry.\n\nThe thing here is you reported them due to jealousy, mainly. And I think you\u2019re aware of this.

So. What DOES he like? Perving on the young woman next door. You think she didn\u2019t notice. Trust me, she did. She just ignored him because she probably has lots of practice dealing with creeps. \n\nBasically your marriage is toxic. Dude man is perving on young women and you\u2019re mad at the young women for it. Sure, seems fair. \n\nLet this be your wake up call. You\u2019re turning into someone you don\u2019t want to be.

It's not that serious.\n\nYall are in a beautiful resort alone for 10 days and had sex once? Sheesh.

Instead of speaking to the couple next door, the hotel should have just moved you. They also have a right to enjoy their vacation.\n\nFurthermore, your husband is a HUGE AH for 1) taking the neighbors side instead of yours, 2) pouting like a baby instead of getting over the awkwardness with the people next door that he will literally never see again, and mostly importantly 3) making you feel self conscious about your body.

The complaining, the nitpicking, and then befriending everyone else in sight. It pisses you off when it seems like they hate everything with you, but somehow put on a good face for others.

NTA, being kept up at night because people have no consideration for their neighbors (whether by sex, partying, or whatever) makes them assholes.\n\nBut uh.

He's inventing all these other problems with the room and the guests and the staff because it allows him to vent his real frustration on something unrelated (like OP did with the other couple). It may also be a way to him to pretend to be in a \"bad mood\" so he can get out of having sex without blaming his wife.\n\nUnless he's always been this insensitive and petty, it's likely that being trapped in a hotel room for nine days with someone with wildly different expectations for what they'd be doing led to a pressure cooker of resentment and discomfort.

None of that is the husband's fault. \n\nRelationships need work, including self-work. Allowing yourself to gain 100lbs (45kg!!) and expecting husband to be fine with that and still find you physically and psychologically appealing is foolishness.

I think their relationship still has hope: hubby has clearly taken the effort to organise a holiday with OP to rekindle things. It shows effort on his part.\n\nThe holiday hasn't been the honeymoon they imagined, but issues in their relationship that have been suppressed have come to the surface, and it is an opportunity to deal with them. For her part, OP needs to (1) commit to starting diet and exercise and work towards a healthy weight, (2) deal with her insecurities on this front, (3) grapple with the relationship, in concert with her husband, as a team. \n\nThe couple next door is at a different phase (honeymoon lust), it shouldn't become a distraction or the standard by which OP and hubby judge their relationship.", "How is the husband an Asshole at all???
