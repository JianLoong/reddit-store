Think Beethoven bag from the St Bernard movies. Now, my dad rather than buying a new one, he went onto Facebook marketplace and found a very nice quality one that can hold up to 125 pounds since I also have an old dog that I would love to take on rides as well. This is also his way of trying to get me to exercise since I obviously put on baby weight and he doesn\u2019t want to come right out and call me fat (I gained 25 pounds from having my son so it\u2019s not like I completely let myself go). The only downside is it would require a 3.5 hour trip to collect and I would have to take my son with me so it really doesn\u2019t sound appealing. I asked if possibly the gentleman could meet me halfway and my father called me selfish and ungrateful. So I just returned the money my dad had sent me and told him it\u2019s not a gift I need immediately and would rather wait until one closer presents itself.
