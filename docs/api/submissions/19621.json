He always means well but sometimes it can come off as harsh.\nSo anyway, my son (1) just had a birthday and one item on our wishlist was a bike trailer that hooks on to the back of a bike and he can sit in it while I ride. Think Beethoven bag from the St Bernard movies. Now, my dad rather than buying a new one, he went onto Facebook marketplace and found a very nice quality one that can hold up to 125 pounds since I also have an old dog that I would love to take on rides as well. This is also his way of trying to get me to exercise since I obviously put on baby weight and he doesn\u2019t want to come right out and call me fat (I gained 25 pounds from having my son so it\u2019s not like I completely let myself go). The only downside is it would require a 3.5 hour trip to collect and I would have to take my son with me so it really doesn\u2019t sound appealing. I asked if possibly the gentleman could meet me halfway and my father called me selfish and ungrateful. So I just returned the money my dad had sent me and told him it\u2019s not a gift I need immediately and would rather wait until one closer presents itself. Now, my sister said that I am not in the wrong since that\u2019s a whole afternoon adventure with a baby and it\u2019s a lot of work but the other set of grandparents said it\u2019s a minor inconvenience for a nice gift. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: yes I asked for this gift originally but it wasn\u2019t high on my priority list.

My dad just volunteered me to sleep on the floor so cousins could take the bed I'd be using for years during a regular vacation, or him yelling at me to get ready while I am getting ready but my brother is sitting around in his pajamas.", "Personally, I don't hold my manager to the same \"thoughtfulness\" standards as my dad. But you do you.", "If you are based in toronto and went south you could have visited Disney land in florida", "I mean I don\u2019t either? It was just a nice gesture. Like I said, I wasn\u2019t expecting it. We have a good relationship. I wasn\u2019t holding him to any standards. The bar is literally on the floor for management to not be terrible \ud83d\ude02", "I see your point, but I would place a gift card which acknowledges the receiver's hobbies and interests, as a slightly more thoughtful gift than just generic cash.\n\nMy uncle gives me cash. I then think \"I should use this for responsible things\". I am still grateful of course! But now I must fight my willpower to buy a toy or pay a bill.\n\nMy uncle gives me a Camera Store gift card?  I can now buy the exact toy I need, guilt-free. \"The money could never have been used any other way anyway!\". That's how I see it.\n\nOn the other hand, if my Uncle just gave me a generic Walmart gift card, it would be on par with just giving cash, but slightly less useful.", "Fair! So can we come together on the best option being a nice card or envelope plus cash, with a thoughtful statement of intention?", "See this is why I\u2019m split on my opinions on gift cards. For my birthday this year my boyfriend bought me a $50 michaels gift card so I could buy myself new yarn because I love crocheting. Had he given me cash, I probably would\u2019ve bought myself food during my lunch break or bought him a birthday present since his birthdays not too far after mine. But it was nice having a $50 budget for something I try not to splurge on too often because it\u2019s not a \u201cnecessity\u201d\nOn the other hand, I have family members that lazily pick out gift cards from things that don\u2019t even pertain to my current interests/things I\u2019ve ever even liked. Like my grandma on my dads side buying me a $50 Claire\u2019s gift card for Christmas when I was 16. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even stepped foot in a Claire\u2019s since elementary school. I ended up using it on my little sister to treat her, but I should\u2019ve been able to at least think about treating myself with my own Christmas gift.", "Check with local bike stores if they have any used ones avail, too.  \n\nAnd multi-hour round trip is insane to act like it's NBD, especially if traveling with a 1 yr old.  Thats before gas cost enters the discussion.  I have 2 kids, I did long distance drives with both of them as small kids.  Their max in car seat was about 2-2.5 hours if I pushed it (little guy lasted longer because his older brother would entertain him). 3.5 hr drive is not 3.5 hrs.  Its more like 5.   \n\nYou are NTA.  Don't feel guilty for returning the money.   That was not a gift.  A gift is something given freely.  This was your dad jerking your chain.  \n\nI guess an alternative would have been to keep the money and tell your dad \"thanks for the gift, as soon as I find the right bike trailer I will send you a picture\".\n\nAs far as the other set of grandparents... normally I would say something very blunt and fairly rude to someone saying this was a minor inconvenience, but that would be because I wouldn't really care about their opinion of me.  If I wanted to keep peace I would probably say something like \"going to the store with my 1 yr old is an adventure, I don't even want to think about a 3 hr drive!\"  Hahaha, and then change subject."]}
