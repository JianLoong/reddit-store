We dated briefly but it didn\u2019t work out and we lost touch. About 7 or 8 months ago, we reconnected on social media and started talking everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. Our relationship only grew, even though we live long distance. I\u2019ve flown/drove to go see her, and we\u2019ve met half-way (10 hour drive one-way). We\u2019ve told each other how much we love each other, and we do. We have a great time together, I adore Shane\u2019s family, and vice versa.\u00a0\n\nMain Story:\n\nNow here\u2019s the issue. About 3 months ago, a friend of Shane\u2019s called her and asked her to adopt a baby she\u2019s pregnant with (still currently pregnant). Shane said yes, she would adopt the baby- as a single parent. I told her that because we were working towards a long-term relationship that I should have been a part of the process, that it should have at least been considered that I be the other mom. Shane told me that she intentionally did not ask me because we weren\u2019t committed to each other in any official capacity- Shane just wants to be a parent by herself. I was heartbroken (feeling like my feelings were dismissed), but I tried my best to get over it because I still love Shane\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t. (I do not have children, and I have fertility issues\u2026 I think that\u2019s a fair point to share.)\u00a0\n\nThis is why I think I may be the AH. I had a really hard time coming to grips with Shane making the choice to parent alone (and not giving me the choice to parent with her). The decision caused a huge rift in our relationship, and my reaction was\u2026 visceral. Even though I still love Shane, I\u2019ve cried about this situation, been upset, aloof, bitter etc, I just couldn\u2019t get past it.\u00a0\n\nTo be fair, technically, we were not together when she found out about the pregnancy, but we were emotionally connected after months of spending time together\u2026 I believe what we have is real and that we were building a solid foundation for something special. Also to be fair, I did try to move past it but all I could imagine was the sonograms without me, the birth, bringing the baby home, all the things, all done without me. I should add here that the surrogate will also come home with Shane and the baby so that Shane can help her recover and breastfeed the baby. I should also add here that Shane did say that she would consider making me a step-parent in the future if the relationship led to a more permanent situation, but for right now I have no right to think that I should be a mother to her baby because it has not been long enough and our relationship isn\u2019t solid (we had been talking everyday for 5/6 months at that point in time).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe discussed it multiple times with no resolution, which led to me breaking up with Shane because I was so hurt. But, do I have the right to be? \n\nAITA for thinking we were having the baby together? AITA for how I reacted to not being asked to be the other mom?", "created_utc": 1670443610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfc3gq/aita_for_thinking_we_were_adopting_a_baby_together/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not about you, or your relationship with Shane.  It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the kid.  And Shane\u2019s right: it\u2019s too soon, and things aren\u2019t stable enough.  The mere fact you\u2019re reacting by being \u201cupset, aloof, bitter, etc.\u201d just further emphasizes how unwise it would be to factor you into any long-term plans when it\u2019s not at all clear you\u2019re going to make it to the point where the kid starts sleeping through the night.", "YTA: I have no idea why you  would believe that your ex who lives 10 hours away that you only recently started to be in contact with you would want to adopt a child with you.  Taking a guess and I think this more a jealousy thing than you being hurt.", "YTA \u2014 for all the reasons above AND for calling Shane\u2019s friend \u201ca surrogate\u201d \n\nShane\u2019s friend isn\u2019t a surrogate. She\u2019s a woman who got pregnant and didn\u2019t want to keep the baby. A surrogate is a person who purposely gets pregnant with the idea of giving the child up for adoption. You\u2019re minimizing who this person is, a friend of Shane\u2019s, by saying she\u2019s a surrogate who\u2019s going to live with her for awhile.", "YTA\n\nYou were in an off and on, short term, long distance relationship. You were very presumptuous in assuming you would be coparenting her child. You moved into A H territory when you got all butt hurt and broke up with her over it.", "YTA. You're not committed enough to have a baby together, and your long distance, so you couldn't actually do any parenting anyway. It's completely unreasonable to think she's ready to have a baby with you.", "YTA. Shane is thinking long term and putting the stability and needs of *the child* first. She is being responsible and deliberate, which is exactly what a prospective parent should do. \n\nYou admit that you only ever dated briefly and it didn\u2019t work out. You may be interested in one another again, but you live 10 hrs apart and haven\u2019t indicated that anyone has been seriously considering and taking steps toward relocating full-time. Why should she automatically assume that you will be getting back together seriously enough that you should be linked together with a child for the rest of your lives? You are allowed to have feelings about this development but honestly I\u2019m with Shane on this one.", "YTA. You\u2019re in a long distance, new relationship. I get the U-Haul lesbian angle, but adopting a baby together would typically mean you two are on severely solid footing. But that\u2019s nowhere where you are now, despite how it may *feel*.Your relationship could still progress without you being a part of the adoption, and if you get there wrt a stable & committed relationship, you could always adopt her child down the road.\n\nTalking a lot every day is not the same as being there. And sharing a child is a huge commitment because if it goes badly, there\u2019s a whole fight to be had. And you don\u2019t even know if the bio mom would be ok with you stepping into this.", "She lives 10 hours away and ya'll have only been \"dating\" for half a year. YTA and tone it down on the crazy.", "YTA \n\n>\tTo be fair, technically, we were not together when she found out about the pregnancy \n\nThat \u201ctechnically\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting for you. The two of you weren\u2019t together. You weren\u2019t in a relationship so I don\u2019t know why you thought you\u2019d get the same parental oversight as Shane \u2014 unless you were hoping to use this baby as a tool to manipulate Shane into a permanent relationship.", "YTA. The relationship isn\u2019t strong enough for you guys to adopt together. One doesn\u2019t adopt a child with someone when they\u2019re not even in a relationship anc it\u2019s just feelings\u2026 a baby is a serious thing. She is right", "YTA - I understand your upset but you really don\u2019t have any right to be upset. Shane, a single woman, decided to adopt. You aren\u2019t legally a couple. You only dated briefly then talked a while later.", "YTA\n\nYou were not asked to adopt the baby, Shane was. \n\nI would not want to make someone I've no commitment with, who I've only been talking to for a year online, and who I've only seen in person a few times, the parent of my child.\n\nShane probably doesn't want to have to worry about sharing custody of her child if you two break up. If it's a step parent situation, she will still have all the rights.", "YTA and this kind of erratic, emotional relationship would make me not want you around my child.", "YTA\n\nShane is being responsible.\n\nShe is making a commitment to the child, to be its parent no matter what. Putting it first already.\n\nNot giving you false hope, knowing you will hold anything she says as a commitment on the topic bc it's so emotionally heavy for you. \n\nIt's unfair to project all your feelings about parenthood on her in this very very new, untested relationship. Until you live together, you have no idea how your lives will actually mesh. \n\nAnyhow it seems like it's for the best bc your expectations are not realistic.", "YTA. Shane was asked by the friend - not you. If you guys weren\u2019t official in any capacity, why on earth would she be want to adopt a child with you?? She even said she\u2019d be open to making you a step-parent if it came to it. \nOn top of the fact that you broke up over this situation lol.. maybe it\u2019s for the better.", "Jesus Christ, YTA. As one queer lady to another, the U-Haul line is a *joke*, not an instruction manual.", "YTA for calling the mom making a parenting plan a surrogate.", "YTA, it\u2019s way to early for this. This is a whole new human being we are talking about not a dog. She needs to make decisions in the baby\u2019s best interest and you guys are mostly a long distance relationship.. I mean those usually always are easy going.. the fact that she has said several times she does not want you to be involved should be a wake up call to you to kindly step back. I\u2019m sure if you were in her position you wouldn\u2019t want to be pestered about your child. If this is too much for you and you want to break up with her for that I think it\u2019s the best choice , that action in itself kinda proves why she didn\u2019t want you around in the first place. You seem to be moving waaay too fast.", "YTA. Six months is way too soon for either of you to be thinking about raising a child together. Shane is absolutely correct. She already told you that she\u2019s open to you becoming a step parent if things work out but for now you would just be her partner. If you can\u2019t support Shane without having equal parenting rights and responsibilities then you should withdraw yourself from this situation.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m very confused on why you would automatically think you would be the other parent. \n\nFirst off, y\u2019all only reconnected 7/8 months ago. 3 months ago Shane\u2019s friend asked her to adopt. So y\u2019all would\u2019ve been together 4 months MAX. \n\nBy your own admission, you two dated years ago and it didn\u2019t work out. You two also are in a long distance relationship, but you still think you would automatically be the other mother?\n\nYeesh, good thing you broke up with Shane, for her own good.", ">less than a year\n\n>long distance\n\n>never even discussed the possibility of having kids together\n\nYTA bordering on delusional.", "A baby is a lifetime commitment. Your relationship with Shane was still pretty new, yet you expected her to add you to her lifelong commitment? When y'all had no clue if you'll be together in a year? And then you broke up with her over this. Just wow.\n\nYTA.", "\"AITA for claiming parental rights to a child that's not mine because I had a failed relationship and some phone calls with the parent?\"\n\nYeah,  YTA. You really assumed a lot thinking you'd co-parent her adopted child without y'all even being formally together. Hell, you'd be overstepping if y'all had been exclusively dating for a year. There's a huge difference between romantic connection with someone and being a parent to their children. You definitely should have backed off of this.", "YTA. Sorry but this decision was made prior to you and the friend did not ask you to adopt. YTA because you are doubling down on how you solely feel then breaking up with her over it... It sucks that you aren't included but you can't force someone into something you weren't even invited to. This is a huge decision. It's is like me buying a house then getting into a relationship and all of a sudden my 6mth partner wants their name on the house... \n\nI know this is not an equivalent comparison as we are talking about a real person not an object but this is HER thing. Not yours. Partners come and go but family does not (and she is the mom here) .. by breaking up with her you have shown your colors to her. You guys aren't even married.", "Soft YTA. Shane's decision #1 to adopt a child, and her decision #2 to partner with someone to raise children together, are two separate decisions of HERS. She was ready to make Decision #1 but was not ready to make Decision #2 with you.\n\nIt's understandable that you would feel sad, left out, all those things. She did not provide an opening for  you to make any decisions to be part of the picture.\n\nIf you didn't completely burn your bridges, it might happen that she would open the door for you to be involved with her FAMILY in the future. But again, that's still her decision for the future in the best interests of the child.", "YTA\n\nAssume Shane was pregnant and not adopting her friend's baby - would you feel you had the \"right\" adopt her child so early in the relationship.\n\nShane is adopting this baby and it has legal as well as emotional ramifications.\n\nIf she had you \"adopt\" the child you would then have equal legal rights to the baby. So if you broke up you could make her life difficult and messy. As a legal parent you would also have equal rights in terms of making all kinds of decisions about the child.\n\nShe was being realistic and wise when she said essentially that you weren't yet in the type of relationship in which she wanted to be legally (and emotionally tied) to you for the next 18 years or more. She was completely correct when she stated the obvious - that if you were still in each other's life after time then things might change - you could be a stepmother or even perhaps you could adopt the child as well.\n\nBut expecting legal \"ownership\" in her child after which is effectively a few months of a LONG DISTANT relationship is not healthy.", "Yta\n\nIt's not like she went out looking to adopt, the friend is pregnant now she needs an answer now. Your situation is that you two are long distance and not even in an official relationship, so how would you even be co parenting? If it actually becomes a relationship with a future, you can always adopt the child, or you two adopt another one together.", "YTA for a lot of reasons. And your title makes no sense- never has she even done anything that should have made you think you were having the baby together, that was all in your head. So you should really change the title to \"AITA for trying to force my girlfriend into a very serious relationship that she states she is not ready for all because I desperately want to be a mom?\"", "YTA - you've been long distance for 7 or 8 months, and you thought she should *adopt a baby* with you? How would you be the other mom when you are doing long distance?\n\nYour expectations do not match the relationship level you were at.", "YTA\n\nIt didn't work out between the two of you before, you've only been together a few months this time around, and long distance at that, and you expect to coparent?\n\nNot to mention, read back on the list of reasons you are upset. They are all about *you*. They have nothing to do with what you would want to give a child, where you saw the relationship going etc, it's all about things *you* would miss out on. You're incredibly selfish.\n\nYou're long distance. Where did you expect the baby to live if you were equal parents? She's doing this by herself and the baby will have a stable home. More stable than your relationship seems to be anyway.", "ma'am, you need to park your u-haul.\n\nShane made this decision when you'd been talking to each for four or five months. doesn't matter how deeply you feel this connection, how many visits have happened, what your conversations were about. doesn't even matter about the prior relationship; this iteration is only 4/5months into it. at that point, you are not a sure thing. you're not a permanent fixture. you are not a guarantee. and you proved that by not being emotionally mature enough to recognize that and torpedoing your own relationship. ggs.\n\nYTA", "YTA- Sounds like Shane and baby dodged a bullet here...", "YTA you\u2019re being obsessive bc you have fertility issues. Shane chose to be a parent you guys were not officially committed there\u2019s no reason she should ask someone to co-parent when y\u2019all haven\u2019t even been dating officially.

Look at the situation in a vacuum, who in their right mind would say, \u201clet me make this person, who I\u2019ve fizzled out with in the past, a parent to my child after talking again for 5 months.\u201d No one. You\u2019ve overstepped and need to apologize. \n\nAlso, did it ever occur to you that the mother is still in this scenario as well?

To the friendship between Shane and the baby\u2019s mother? Stop being so obtuse.", "7 months is the shortest of short-term toe-dips in terms of relationships.\n\nYou are in no way ready to commit to parenthood if you are viewing this child\u2019s future through the lens of your own fertility issues, fear of exclusion, desire for a long term relationship with Shane.\n\nYou have demonstrated impatience and petulance about Shane\u2019s situation\u2014a situation that was not yours from the start.\n\nMove on, work on those emotional glitches you got going on and perhaps one day you\u2019ll be free to just let the things that are not yours, be.", "YTA. You two are not in a committed relationship, and therefore probably not ready to parent together. If you continue to date, then she would likely incorporate you into the child\u2019s life at some point, but it\u2019s actually smart of her to adopt as a single parent. If your relationship doesn\u2019t work out then there is no custody battle.", "YTA. Shane (lol) is definitely making the right call; you haven't been together a meaningful length of time in terms of a big decision like becoming coparents. She's also being really clear about wanting to move this relationship slowly and it doesn't sound like you're really acknowledging those signals.\n\nFrom one gay to another: you're staking a lot on the future of this seemingly tenuous relationship. Might be time to give therapy or CODA (Codependents Anonymous) a solid try. The fact that you're using the name of a character who is notoriously unable to commit as an alias for this woman is says something.", "Yta. You weren\u2019t official and in a long distance \u2018relationship\u2019. So you have no rights to this baby.", "YTA - it\u2019s too soon for Shane to make you part of her family in that way and tbh you seem a bit too immature to raise a child given your reaction to not getting your own way", "YTA and you sound like you may be delusional. You might want to talk to someone or seek help", "YTA. It also sounds like you\u2019re actually the \u2018affair\u2019 partner", "YTA. Shane is right. Your relationship isn't established enough to make that big step. Long distance is very different than living together. And once you are in, you are in -- you would have rights to the baby even if you broke up. She is not ready to risk that. Nor should she be. This is a child, not a stuffed animal, who needs a stable home with clear boundaries and connections.", "YTA. Shane is adopting as a single parent and you two aren't in any kind of relationship that dictates your position as a step parent. You're not even engaged. I get you have fertility issues, but this is irrelevant to the child. You live 10 hours away. How would you even be able to parent the child in that capacity? You are well within your right to use assisting reproductive technology if you want to have a baby and also be a single parent if your desire to have a child is so great, but you do not have the right to have this child.", "YTA\n\nBy your words, you and Shane aren't even official.  So no, you are, in now way, part of the process.  You don't live together.  You aren't committed to each other.  You're 8 months into a long distance relationship.  Even if you were in the same city, you're 8 months into a relationship and you're upset Shane is having a kid?  \n\nThere's some issues here that are bigger than Reddit's pay grade.", "YTA.  She just reconnected with you recently and you don\u2019t live in the same place and won\u2019t be raising the child.  It would be deeply unfair to that child to consider you a second parent, and really harmful if you two separated again after you are already in the child\u2019s life. And it\u2019s the child that matters most here.\n\nShe is acting like a parent by prioritizing her child\u2019s needs.  You are emphatically proving yourself not ready to raise this particular child in this particular situation, by centering yourself here.\n\nOf course you have the right to feel any way you feel, but not to make it Shane\u2019s problem or to have the expectations you apparently had.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so painful, but you\u2019ve both made the right choice here.\n\ni", "YTA, you were dating for like 6 months. That\u2019s obliviously too soon to be discussing adopting a child together. This is her child and you could have become a parent to this child later. You even said she found out about this baby before you were even together. \n\nI know they say lesbians move fast (trope, obviously, no lady\u2019s ever moved in with me, also a lady, after one date) but this is super sonic. It makes sense that Shane would want to ensure a committed and stable relationship for a baby.", "YTA\n\nI think you think this relationship is more seriously than it is. You are clearly more emotionally invested than she it. You said you've gone to see her and you've both met halfway. When did she make the trip to see you?\n\nSomeone Shane knows asked her to parent this child, they did not ask you. Should the relationship grow, then I imagine you could be seen as a second parent. It almost seems like you were hoping this baby would somehow \"save\" or \"strengthen\" your relationship with Shane and offer you some sort of security that you guys are more serious. That's just not how things work.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t have to ask you anything. You have no say in her life. My goodness. I hope Shane sees the warning flags you come with. Go apologize. Try to be a compassionate person. With any luck you can get back to getting to know each other", "YTA", "Oh honey, this is so difficult for you. You are seeing this from your side and I understand your side and empathise with you completely. But you have to see it from Shane's side. Her friend asked her to take on a baby. She had to think solely of what that would mean for her. How it would effect the rest of her life. She couldn't take into account your relationship. She didn't know if it was going to last or not, it was too new. She couldn't let it influence her mind. She had to stand alone to decide what she was going to do. She couldn't let you sway her by making her promises you might choose not to keep. Or, the opposite, that she decided to take the baby based on the promise of your support and then realised later that she didn't want the baby, she got carried away with the idea. She was right to keep a clear head without your opinion and then if your relationship blossomed to bring you into the baby's life later. I know you feel pushed out, I can see your side and I'm sorry for that, truly.  YTA", "NAH\n\nI understand your perspective and feelings, but she\u2018s still right.

This is so common in relationships.", "NAH. \n\nYou guys obviously were not on the same page with your rekindled relationship. Shane did not see you as a serious forever partner and went ahead with her plans without you, which she was completely within her rights to do. You thought things were more serious and reacted appropriately with regards to how you viewed the relationship IMO. As hard as it will be you just need to move on.", "NAH.

We dated briefly but it didn\u2019t work out and we lost touch. About 7 or 8 months ago, we reconnected on social media and started talking everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. Our relationship only grew, even though we live long distance. I\u2019ve flown/drove to go see her, and we\u2019ve met half-way (10 hour drive one-way). We\u2019ve told each other how much we love each other, and we do. We have a great time together, I adore Shane\u2019s family, and vice versa.\u00a0\n\nMain Story:\n\nNow here\u2019s the issue. About 3 months ago, a friend of Shane\u2019s called her and asked her to adopt a baby she\u2019s pregnant with (still currently pregnant). Shane said yes, she would adopt the baby- as a single parent. I told her that because we were working towards a long-term relationship that I should have been a part of the process, that it should have at least been considered that I be the other mom. Shane told me that she intentionally did not ask me because we weren\u2019t committed to each other in any official capacity- Shane just wants to be a parent by herself. I was heartbroken (feeling like my feelings were dismissed), but I tried my best to get over it because I still love Shane\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t. (I do not have children, and I have fertility issues\u2026 I think that\u2019s a fair point to share.)\u00a0\n\nThis is why I think I may be the AH. I had a really hard time coming to grips with Shane making the choice to parent alone (and not giving me the choice to parent with her). The decision caused a huge rift in our relationship, and my reaction was\u2026 visceral. Even though I still love Shane, I\u2019ve cried about this situation, been upset, aloof, bitter etc, I just couldn\u2019t get past it.\u00a0\n\nTo be fair, technically, we were not together when she found out about the pregnancy, but we were emotionally connected after months of spending time together\u2026 I believe what we have is real and that we were building a solid foundation for something special. Also to be fair, I did try to move past it but all I could imagine was the sonograms without me, the birth, bringing the baby home, all the things, all done without me. I should add here that the surrogate will also come home with Shane and the baby so that Shane can help her recover and breastfeed the baby. I should also add here that Shane did say that she would consider making me a step-parent in the future if the relationship led to a more permanent situation, but for right now I have no right to think that I should be a mother to her baby because it has not been long enough and our relationship isn\u2019t solid (we had been talking everyday for 5/6 months at that point in time).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe discussed it multiple times with no resolution, which led to me breaking up with Shane because I was so hurt. But, do I have the right to be? \n\nAITA for thinking we were having the baby together? AITA for how I reacted to not being asked to be the other mom?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Take a deep breath, drop the outrage and support Shane in her efforts to create a safe and stable home for this little baby.", "YTA\u2026. In what world do you live in that two\npeople who don\u2019t even live together adopt a child together? How were you planning on parenting this child from ten hour away? And when your delicate feelings got hurt by her very reasonable expectations on this adoption you broke up with her showing how right her decision to be a single parent was.", "Why would Shane even consider a life long co-parent relationship with someone she has been  talking to less than a year?Seriously?\n\nI am truly sorry for your fertility issues. That doesn't entitle you to Shane's baby.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Not a single thing in that story makes that make sense. You were not even together- in your own words you were just \u201ctalking\u201d, and for about six months max. Why on earth would that lead you to believe you have the right to be her baby\u2019s other parent? On another note, I am SO sorry for your fertility issues and trust me when I say I understand, but that isn\u2019t relevant here. Your fertility issues have nothing to do with Shane\u2019s decision because you are. Not. Her. Partner.", "Ugh\u2026 YTA. I\u2019m really not saying this to be cruel but you sound more than a touch delusional here, love. You\u2019d been \u201ctalking\u201d for 5 *months* when Shane was first approached about adopting the baby and you weren\u2019t even official. \n\nThat\u2019s the key: you weren\u2019t official. \n\nRegardless of how optimistic you may have felt about your potential future together \u2014 and despite the fact that *you* felt deeply emotionally attached to her \u2014 it should\u2019ve been clear to you at that point that Shane wasn\u2019t viewing your relationship through the same long term lens. If you two had been in a proper relationship when she agreed to adopt, then you\u2019d be right and she should\u2019ve talked to you about it first; however, it seems pretty obvious that she only regarded you as someone she was casually dating long distance and didn\u2019t feel anywhere close to the same level of commitment to you that you did to her. \n\nFrankly, you\u2019re also being very selfish with respect to what would be in the best interests of the child. I realize that couples have \u201coops\u201d babies early on in relationships all the time but, often, those relationships don\u2019t last and the child is caught in the middle between two people who ultimately didn\u2019t really know or love each other before getting pregnant. Given that Shane has a *choice* in this case, why would she willingly give parental rights to someone she\u2019s been casually dating for less than a year?? It makes no sense, especially when the two of you were barely a couple. Her offer to someday make you a stepparent if things became more permanent was 100% reasonable. \n\nI hate to be that person who says \u201cTHERAPY!\u201d but I really do think you\u2019d benefit from therapy. The intensity of your attachment to Shane, your feelings about being infertile, and your disproportionate heartbreak over the baby in this situation are all things that a professional may be able to help you work through.", "Yta who would want to adopt a baby with someone they\u2019re not even committed to. You live 10 hours apart what happens if you break up in 2 months. That legal tie does not go away", "WHOA are you ever a walking canister of red flags. Talking? For less than a year? And not official? And you wanted to be considered as this child\u2019s PARENT, and threw a fit not to be?\n\nYeah, YTA", "YTA for expecting too much too soon and. Ow you\u2019ve ruined what could have grown into a meaningful relationship in the future. It\u2019s a shame", "The fact you think you can just wedge yourself back into her life in full capacity just screams of toxicity. \n\nYou do not commit to the level of being an equal say but you want equal say. \n\nDoesn't work like that", "YTA. Having a child together is a huge responsibility, you shouldn't be doing that unless you're certain the other person is going to be a permanent fixture in your life. You've been dating long distance for less than a year, and by your own admission you weren't even together at the time she made this decision. There is (or at least was) a possibility that your relationship will become more stable and serious in the future, and if you had stayed together maybe you could have become co-parents in the future, but it is way too soon to consider adopting a child together now.", "YTA, *why on earth* would you just assume she\u2019s adopting the child with you and that you\u2019re now the other parent? Have you lost your mind?", "YTA. Shane has a life apart from you.", "YTA- you have zero right to even have an opinion on this.  You have not been together in a serious committed relationship for years and don\u2019t even live together.  You both haven\u2019t even gotten to a point to talk about moving closer to each other or in with each other. How do you think you get to be a parent with her?  You are letting your personal feelings of wanting to be a parent cloud your judgment here. Or you have some serious issues that you need to work out.  I would absolutely never ever consider someone I have been dating for several months to do parent with me.  Sorry but that\u2019s something that comes way down the line.", "YTA.  And as another WLW, did you have your U-Haul already packed and ready to go? Shane is being rational by not letting you be involved right away.  And your reactions kind of point to you not being ready to handle this.", "Shane wanted to be a single mother before you reconnected. Shane\u2019s friend asked her and her alone to adopt the child (and she is not a \u201csurrogate\u201d, she is just a friend of Shane\u2019s who got pregnant and cannot/does not want to raise a child but knows someONE who does, and that person is also not you). Even after all that, it\u2019s still important to note that Shane will be taking care of the baby every day while you are 10 hours away. You have not said you have plans to move closer or move in together or anything at all beyond your long distance relationship of five months, a relationship younger than the fetus even. Do you hear yourself?\n\nEdit: yta", "You live 10 hours away, you've only been talking for 6 months, and you're not even committed to each other yet. Why on earth would you expect her to make you the other parent to her child? YTA.", "YTA\n\nyou're trying to be permanently tied to Shane. In nowhere in your post did you talk about your desire to be a parent or about discussing kids with Shane at any point in your relationship. She's adopting this child without you and if you keep up with this, she will drop you", "YTA bc despite how you felt about the relationship there wasn't one so your opinion on if she should raise a baby alone is not her problem. And let's be clear it's your way of thinking that ruined things not her not including you.", "YTA. This is a very serious situation, we are talking about a childs life. Committed partners sometimes can't make it work and the kids are the ones that suffer. You two are not in an exclusive relationship, cohabiting, or talking marriage. You can revisit the situation in the future if the two of you become serious.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s obvious here. Shane doesn\u2019t see you as a long term partner. Your right if you are a long term partner or your in a relationship you should have been at least asked.   But you weren\u2019t. She went out of her way to not talk to you about it and then directly told you that she did it cause your not an official couple.  I think this is just your sign to face the facts. Your putting more into this than Shane is.  And it\u2019s time to move on and find someone who will give you what you deserve.", "NTA. You were dating and telling each other you love them. Anyone even casually dating should be consulted about a life-changing decision like that. She made a unilateral decision without her partner. That shows zero respect for you, and honestly, I couldn't stay in a relationship where my choice, opinion, and say had no hold. That's a dictatorship, not a partner.", "NTA, I'm sorry bud but you thought you were more important to Shane than you really are. If you were really reconciling and beginning a long-term relationship, she would have taken that into account. Instead she is very clearly putting her hand against your chest and pushing you away. Find someone who will actually love you.", "NTA\n\nOne of the lesbian couples I knew worked together to pick a donor that was ethnically (and questionnaire survey answer) similar to the non birthing spouse, just so she'd feel a bit more of a connection.", "I read half and your ex is insane. You can have a baby without her. It\u2019s so all good. She needs to check herself. You\u2019re mom.", "NTA. It appears you were more committed to this relationship than she was. If she did not see a future with you where you were a partner that she had kids with, she was viewing the relationship in very short term limits. It is strange to be in a relationship with someone and not discuss adopting a child and you do not seem to want to date a single parent when the child isn\u2019t yours. This is a comparability issue. I\u2019d consider it a bullet dodged and move on.", "Agree with this completely.", "Actually, I think a surrogate more means that they are carrying YOUR baby for you.", "Every single reason she wanted to be the mother was a selfish one. All me, me, me.", "Oh I imagine OP would want the baby to live in both places, another reason not to do it", "Ok, I've never heard of a \"U-Haul lesbian\" until Reddit. This is the second time.

But she, understandably, wants to be in a very stable relationship before she shares parenting with someone. That's a very different thing.", "Shane is early 30s and an opportunity to become a mother arose.\n\nShe chose not to allow a tentative relationship  to impact her decision to become a parent. That's responsible. They weren't even together when Shane found out about the pregnancy. \n\nI think OP's got exactly what she deserves because every reason she was upset was incredibly selfish", "At the time that OP\u2019s partner was asked to adopt this baby, she had only been dating OP for three months.

The relationship is only 6 months old, ffs.It is absurd that OP thought that just because her new girlfriend is having a baby, that she should automatically be a parent to that baby. It's an immature, irrational notion that proves just how *not ready* to be a parent OP is.YTA, OP. You're allowed to have feelings, but if you're being bitter and reacting 'viscerally' because your gf is making a rational choice based on the welfare and best interests of her new child, then you're a total ass.
