I told her again I needed brand new ones but she just got mad at me and said if I don\u2019t wear these ones I don\u2019t get one at all, so I took them finally after a little more arguing and washed them probably 6 times (*exaggeration don\u2019t hate me*). Then at supper my mom told my dad and sister how spoilt I was being, and my dad reprimanded me and I tried to say again I just found it uncomfortable wearing bras my *sister* had already worn but I just got sent to my room instead.

Whether or not it\u2019s \u201clogical\u201d underwear is different. Do your parents buy their underwear at the goodwill??  Sometimes, younger siblings deserve things that are brand new, only for them. This is definitely one of those times. \n\nAlso it seems unlikely that you and your sister are exactly the same size. Wearing a bra that isn\u2019t the proper size can be painful (not to mention unflattering).", "NTA. Bras need to be fitted in a way that other clothing does not. A bra that fits poorly can cause pinching, painful chafing or just be next to useless if it\u2019s too big. There are plenty of sizing instructions online and you can get some cheap bras, which are probably fine for you while you\u2019re still growing. \n\nDo they often tell you you\u2019re ungrateful? Does your sister often get new things (not just new clothes) while you don\u2019t?", "NTA - Not at all. That *is* gross. Girl, what size do you need? I'll ship directly to you.\n\nEdit: Seriously though. If you setup an Amazon wish list and add what you need, I'll buy them off your list so I never even need to know your address.", "NTA According to the NIH you are much more likely to suffer fungal, bacterial, parasitic or viral infections from second hand bras. Although if you wash them that chance goes down to zero but still eww", "NTA honey. How rebellious are you feeling right now? Would you be up for some malicious compliance? Walk around your house completely bra-less for as long as it takes your asshole parents to buy you some new bras of your own. Obviously the worst that can happen is that they send you to your room, which sounds like a haven given your circumstances.", "NTA. There is a reason 99% of all thrift stores do Not sell any form of underwear: nobody wants to wear used underwear. \n\nThey simply Can\u2019t sell it. \n\nHeck the ladies at our local Red Cross store says they can\u2019t even give it away if they get some in by mistake.", "Nta it's a freaking bra ffs. Let the kid have a new one. You can buy online at a reasonable price. How horrid are the people complaining about a teen wanting a new bra. Not even a bra and pantie set. Just a bra.

NTA - this is underwear and you should feel clean and comfortable", "Some of this depends on your new dimensions, honestly.  \nLarger sized bras are not like big bandaids that you just happen to strap across your chest. Good ones provide a lot of support and shape under your regular clothes, and what works for one person will not work for another.  Demi-cup, full cup, underwired, wide band, padded, unlined... all of these things can make a huge difference in your comfort. A bad bra can HURT.   \nAnd I'm not even going to think about used athletic bras that are designed to absorb sweat.... just, no.   \n\n\nNTA, I am so sorry you are having to deal with this.", "NTA.  I think hand me down clothes are fine but underwear is a different story.  Also, why would your mom think it is okay to discuss your chest with your dad and sister?

Not only is it underwear... bras need to be fitted to you, there's a reason there isn't just \"small, medium, large\", and even the best ones do not last that long.", "NTA. \n\nAn old shirt vs UNDERGARMENTS, not even close to the same. \n\nI'm a thrift store fiend, I do not mind hand me downs and second hand, but I would NEVER buy used undergarments or swimsuits... that's just....ew.", "NTA!\n\nIt's not just about hygiene, bras are also a very personal matter, they need to be fitted to be really comfortable and offer the support needed. You probably don't have the exact same measurements as your sister, and even if you did, bras get worn out over time and stop fitting then. You definitely need your own bras and you parents sound quite mean and unfair, especially given that you are ok with wearing hand me downs most of the time. I'm sorry \ud83e\udec2", "NTA. It's completely normal for a 15 year old to want their own things, especially since it's a bra (I've worn my older sister's before, but it's not spoiled of you to have a boundary).

Nta", "NTA your bra should be fitted properly. Yeah, they are expensive, and it would be convenient if you could wear the same size as your sister. But it doesn\u2019t sound as if you\u2019ve even been measured to check size.", "NTA. you need something new thats not worn out and will give your bubbies the support they need. You also be properly measured to make sure you\u2019re getting the right fit. Those very valid issues aside, bras get gross after a while with the deodorant buildup.  You could\u2019ve washed them 60 times and it still might not go away.", "Nta! A bra is underwear and you don\u2019t recycle underwear. I\u2019d be grossed out at wearing someone else\u2019s bras, underwear, or swimsuit.", "Uhm, so, your sister gets brand new and you get her crappy used clothing? Are you even the same size? NTA - your parents are cheaping out. Do you have any other family, allies, you can turn to?", "NTA. I'm not a boob haver myself, but from what I know proper sizing is very important for proper comfort. That makes me think they're not good candidates for hand me downs. \n\nI don't see why it should be gross to wear them, but if that makes you uncomfortable you have a right to express it. Your parents could at least acknowledge you feel that way, even if their decision to make you wear the bras doesn't change. Punishing you for having or expressing a feeling is unfair.", "It seems very clear to me that you're NTA. To me, it *is* like borrowing a shirt or something, but since we've spent our entire lives being taught that breasts are \"private parts,\" it makes sense why some people would feel kind of gross about it. No one wants to wear hand-me-down or thrifted underwear, so I can see how you could feel the same way about a bra.", "NTA bud. I\u2019m sorry. I wish you could get new bras, and you definitely aren\u2019t spoiled for wanting ones of your own, especially at that age. Don\u2019t worry though, even though it seems a little gross, bras aren\u2019t like undies where they get any dirtier than they would a normal shirt or tanktop. It seems kind of weird that your parents don\u2019t want you to have a job- I hope they change their mind someday soon. You deserve to make your own income!", "NTA. The chances of your rib cage being exactly the same size of your sister as well as your chest are incredibly low. Plus the elastic on bra bands wears down over time, which lessens the support a bra can provide. This is without getting into details like the shape/projection/etc of your chest which will lead to different needs.\n\nAn ill fitting bra can cause back problems. Will your parents want to cough up the money to see a specialist should these hand me down bras damage your back? Cheaper for them to just buy you a bra or two in your size.", "NTA. Underwear shouldn\u2019t be passed down in my opinion. Realistically, you only need one or two bras and if your parents aren\u2019t strapped for cash/living paycheck to paycheck, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue. I don\u2019t know if this is your mom playing favorites or she was also a hand-me-down child so she doesn\u2019t see the issues, but either way you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA, hand-me down underwear is gross. It IS very different from worn shirts, sweaters, trousers. I understand you did not want this,", "NTA.\n\nAnd why is your mother humiliating you at the dinner table? \n\nBras are pretty expensive though. I don't blame you for not wanting to wear someone else's... its kind of like sharing underwear... even though it's been washed, it's a bit weird.", "NTA.  I'm a dude and find this disgusting.  I would not wear used underwear under any circumstances.  When my grandfather died, my evil step-grandmother emptied his sock and underwear drawers into a box and mailed it to me.  I opened it and it's used socks (something else I'd never wear) and old yellowed tighty whiteys and undershirts, not folded or anything, just a big heap in a box.  The box went in the trash and a I never spoke to her again.", "NTA - ick factor aside bras are one of the things that should definitely fit you properly and hand me downs aren't appropriate unless you've been properly measured as a match for them.\n\nNot to mention they can lose their shape and elasticity over time. So a 34B, for example, may still not be quite right even if that is your size. \n\nYou're not being spoilt at all for asking for this one thing to be new. It seems you get mostly hand me downs, I'll bet they're not used to you asking for much and are reacting badly to that as much as anything.", "It\u2019s not a hill to die on, but I wouldn\u2019t want to wear them either.  There are some clothing items that should be new, and that includes bras.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf the old bras fit you, there really isn't anything wrong with wearing them. However, an ill fitting bra is right up there with shoes that are just a little too tight. \n\nNote that while I also think hand-me-downs are a godsend for kids, each kid also deserves new clothes at times.", "NTA, \nBeing forced to wear a hand-me-down bra and then being punished for choosing not to? \nIt is not the equivalent to a shirt at all and is somthing you should have a choice in. The fact you have to put in you can't buy your own really upsets me. If you don't feel comfortable with putting certain clothing on YOUR body then you shouldn't have to.", "NTA. I was poor growing up and about 95% of my clothes were hand me downs from my sister and thrift stores. That said, my Mom always bought me new socks, underwear, bras, and shoes. Which all were worn until they were holey and useless before being replaced. There are just some things you should just buy new.", "NTA, intimate clothing is different than pants and shirts and it's pretty gross to wear 2nd hand stuff.", "NTA\u2026 what does she want next? For you to wear your sisters old thongs? Nah, that\u2019s nasty. She needs to get a grip.", ":(\n\nNta, I understand being uncomfortable, it's sharing an intimate clothing piece, I myself wouldn't wanna share and it just shows no care for your opinion on things that directly effect you.", "NTA\n\nI personally don't care about wearing second hand washed bra, but I totally understand if someone else does. It's an underwear. I'm sorry, your parents sound kinda toxic.", "NTA", "Tell your parents...a used shirt is one thing whereas used undergarments are kind of 'cringey'.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this and have to live with your awful parents for 3 more years. The way they\u2019re treating you is very wrong.", "NTA- sounds toxic", "NTA at all and i\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this!! you are NOT spoiled for wanting your own UNDERWEAR!! it would be one thing if your parents were telling you to wear it until they had a chance to buy you one, but you need your own! i\u2019d be willing to bet hers aren\u2019t a proper fit, either. i also have a large chest (like, i\u2019m gonna get a reduction someday) and it\u2019s really important you have bras that fit and support you properly because you don\u2019t want to end up with back problems someday. \n\nmy advice would be to reach out to other female family members for some help, like an aunt or a grandmother, hell maybe even your sister if you think she\u2019d take your side! even just one bra that fits right and is *yours* is far better than only having hand me downs. i feel for you so much and ik i\u2019m just an internet stranger but if you need any help i\u2019m here for you!!", "That is underwear, not the same as an old shirt. I\u2019d be grossed out to. You\u2019re parents are acting like jerks. NTA.", "NTA and not because it's unsanitary but more importantly bras are not something with wiggle room in sizing. Sizes are much more specific to both cup and chest measurements and wearing the wrong size is uncomfortable but also can cause health problems. Hand me downs are understandable in a lot of cases but I'm of the mind that younger kids should also get their own new items at least occasionally, at a minimum for under garments.", "NTA for me either I'll wear a lot of secondhand clothes i.e jeans, tshirts, hoodies, shorts and somw pajamas sometimes even certain socks but only if they've been worn once or twice and appear newer but the one thing I refuse to buy or accept secondhand is bras and panties!! there are  two exceptions to this rule for me and that is if they are my size which is incredibly hard to even find in a store. I have to order them online or buy at cacique when they have a sale tbey still have the tags on from being brought i.e they were the wrong size and never worn I'll buy, or the panties are still sealed in the bag or have the original tags on. \n\nI'm a 39 year old woman and it's the one thing I will say a properly fitting bra is a must no matter what age you are. I've worn badly fitting or wrong sized ones for years until this last weekend it was eye opening the difference, it made no more squished or sore boobs no cup camping or quad boobing and no rubbing or chaffing.  not to be rude most women actually wear the wrong sized bra without realizing because most stores insist on grouping all women in to thinking  your a 30, 32, 34, 36 ,38, 40 A, B, C, D, DD or if your big a DDD cup that's the only sizes available in most generic stores. Added already worn bras are Usually stretched as everyone's size and breast shapes are so so different.\n\nMaybe head over to the subreddit\nR/ABraThatFits there is several links to finding the right bra and also use this \n https://www.abrathatfits.org/calculator.php to truly find out what your bra size will be!! I shared this incase you decide to  take another posters offer up on them buying and shipping a bra or two for you please, please  make sure you definately know your true size don't hazard a guess there's nothing worse than a I'll fitting or uncomfy bra even as \u00e0 teenager. That is why I shared how to find out size.\n\nI wish I had the budget I'd also help send you some  too, I've made sure my daughter is wearing the correct bra size as well be warned if you find our your cup size isn't the generic sizing you expected  it can be a bit of a shock thinking hey I'm a B cup when the ABTF gives you something that says your way different. That guide was a life changer for me!", "INFO\n\nCan your parents afford new bras?  My mom couldn't so I had to wear my cousin's hand me downs. I got to pick between new underwear or new bras.  Of course I picked the underwear. I got -- lucky? My breasts ended up two cup size bigger then my cousin. Then I got a new bra which I had to wash at night and hang to dry because mom could only afford one.\n\nIf they can't afford it and told you no so they have money for food/rent then yes you are the asshole.\n\nIf they can afford it and just don't want to buy you new bras then they are the asshole.", "YTA bras are frogging expensive.

Find a time when itbia just the both of you and your mum isn't distracted by other tasks or people. Speak clearly and maturely that you do not mind hand me down clothes at all. It is thrify and good for the environment. But you want your own underwear, including bra. Tell her that whilst it is irrational, it really makes you very very uncomfortable and distressing.  Explain that you know it is just material, but as soon as possible, could you and she buy a couple of inexpensive bras together. DONT WHINE!

I\u2019ll contribute however I can!  OP,  the other comments in this thread have also given great resources to find the size that can fit you best & most comfortably!  Another thing about the hand-me-downs, some of the more supportive components of the bra (straps, bottom band elastic & back material) are elastic/stretchy.  It breaks down & stretches out over time with repeated wearing & washing; rendering the bra useless.  Especially if you are well endowed.  Plus the underwire can bend/warp, and the cups can break down if they are molded foam (if your sister was super hard on your bras or pests got to them while they were in storage).  Your parents are doing you a MAJOR disservice!  \n\nPro-tip if you do end up getting new bras; you can help them last longer by either hand washing them & hanging to dry, or machine washing on a DELICATE cycle with cool to warm water (not hot, and cool is better if you have a decent detergent that breaks down well at cooler temps) and put them in a laundry bag or pillow case.  I find that the smaller the load, the better too, so I typically only was my bras with my socks & underwear.\n\nEdit: if you\u2019re concerned about mom intercepting any of your packages (if you take us up on this) do you have anyone you are close to you, that you trust who would let your packages get shipped to them?", "Put some clothes & shoes on there too, you deserve new things that are only yours", "Say the word and youll get your bras!

A badly fitting bra can give you headaches, muscle cramps, big angry red welts where the straps sit. If the underwire pokes out it will straight up stab you in the chest. \n\nAs to the hygiene, while I'm sure you could sterilize a bra with enough hot water & detergent, they harbour bacteria a lot better than something like a shirt. A shirt is usually 1 layer of normal woven fabric. A bra has woven fabric as a lining, a foam cup, and elastic for the band and straps.
