She was really stressed for it, which I would attribute to her not being super strong in the humanities. She knew this exam was going to be challenging for her, though, so she studied her ass off. She still didn't feel like she was getting it, and I could tell she was putting in effort, so I hired a tutor for a session around a day before the exam. She was still rough.\n\nI told her she could only do her best, and no matter what, we'd figure it out. I was proud of her for getting over her anxiety and just putting in work, as she often has avoidance issues.\n\nYou can imagine my pleasure when, after she returns from the exam, I get an CC'd on an email from her teacher, we'll call her Mrs. Roberts. It said \"I just wanted to assure you that I took a cursory glance at the test, and though the last short answer question I can see is wrong, it seems like you are on track to do just as well as everyone else\". My daughter was overjoyed, because when she came back from the test, she said she really wasn't sure how it went.\n\nToday, my daughter came home in tears. She explained that she got a 65% on her midterm, and she didn't know how she could've done so badly. I really didn't care about the email at that point because I just wanted to comfort her.\n\nWhen Mrs. Roberts called me to discuss the results, I had a very cordial conversation with her in which I explained that my daughter had studied, and clearly we needed to come up with a better way for her to be successful in Law and Gov. I in no way blame the teacher for my daughter's grade - that's not what bothered me.\n\nI mentioned (and I was really trying my best not to sound bitchy) that I would prefer next time if she would refrain from telling my daughter anything before she had fully graded, just incase something like this might happen. She got really defensive, and said that she never promised us anything and that even if my daughter was upset, it was on;y her own fault for not studying (which, again, I never put any blame on her for my daughter's issues with the class). I defended my daughter, reiterating she had studied, but Mrs. Roberts responded with \"Well, I didn't see any evidence of that\".\n\nIt ended really awkwardly and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was overreacting. AITA?\n\n\\*Edit: I should clarify a few things: one, I did mess up in not getting her a tutor sooner. That's totally on me and was a bad parenting move. Two, my daughter does normally advocate for herself, but both the email and phone call were initiated by Mrs. Roberts. I do not believe in doing everything for her at 17, but there was established communication between me and the teacher due to issues in the past.", "created_utc": 1674495111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ji4us/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_teacher_she/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks that that strategy ended up backfiring and doesn't work for your daughter - but it sounds like you may have been unreasonably irritated by what was clearly an accidental misjudgment.\n\nThe teacher should not have reacted defensively to the feedback that her strategy doesn't work well for your daughter.

I came out with a DDD (triple distinction, highest score you could get with a BTEC\n\nUni fucked me in the ass though, left with a 3rd (lowest passing grade) due to a combination of extreme depression in my third year (I actually passed my 1st and 2nd years with a 2.1, 2nd highest grade) but because I never learned how to study, I sucked at it.\n\nMy point being I never studied. But I breezed through school.\n\nOne of my friends studied hours every day. They studied during lunch, they studied for hours after school. They turned in every bit of homework, would ask the teachers multiple questions during lessons.\n\nFor every bit I was lazy, they were diligent.\n\nThey didn't get a single grade above a C in high school.\n\nStudying doesn't necessarily do shit if one does not 'get' the subject. It just makes it so you get frustrated.\n\nAnd for anyone who thinks I'm a dick for 'bragging' above... don't.\n\nI cannot study for the life of me, I am now 31 and struggle so hard to learn anything new, because if I do not instantly get it, I really struggle to get it.\n\nLearn how to study, it helps in life.", "Schools get additional funding based on the number of passed AP exams.

Either way I\u2019d have to be absolutely sure before saying anything. \n\nAlso, if a kid wasn\u2019t doing well but was insisting they were studying, I\u2019d start digging into how they were studying.

I would recommend looking over the test with your daughter and make sure that everything has been graded correctly.

If the class average was a C and your daughter usually gets Fs then what she said was factual.", "Is 65% so terrible? That used to be like a c when I was at school, or a 2:1 at uni. Both were reasonable, esp at one paper that\u2019s not your strongest?", "NTA\n\nAs a teacher, I do not tell students their grades until I am 100% sure of the grade. I have personal conferences with students about their essays, and it's not uncommon for them to try to get me to name a letter grade. I politely tell them I will not because I know that me quickly skimming in a conference environment is not the same as me sitting down to actually evaluate the paper in terms of merit and adherence to course guidelines. While it is true that the teacher didn't make any promises, she should recognize that her actions were not the most professional. \n\nIt was also inappropriate of the teacher to insinuate your daughter wasn't studying. Yes, most students who do poorly do so because they're not putting in the work. But it's also common sense that some students are going to study and still do badly. If you suspect a student isn't studying, the correct thing to do is ask questions to gain more information, not to just accuse the student of not putting in the work. \n\nIf you don't already have a copy of the exam, I recommend you request it so future tutors can use that to help your daughter. I would also go through the exam with the teacher and ask her to identify what your daughter is doing wrong.

In order to help alleviate some of that anxiety she took a quick glance at your daughters test and communicated with you.\n\nUpon closer evaluation of the answers some were probably not as detailed as necessary ( it's a comment i have had a lot ) or a wrong track of thought was followed, leading to a 65%. \n\nYou communicated with the teacher about your preferences for next time, which apparently landed badly, putting the teacher on the defensive. Leading to a less than positive communication onward.", "Yes! The rest of the interaction I was torn about but that\u2019s really uncalled for to just issue a verdict on studying like that. For one, she\u2019s plain old wrong \u2014 the issue wasn\u2019t the effort, it was somewhere in the comprehension or recall etc. For two, even if that was the issue, I think that\u2019s a very demotivating way to put it. She should have asked open ended questions about study habits, number of hours studied, distractions etc and I think it\u2019s best to start off asking what could have gone better for next time. It sounds like more tutoring is needed (but also maybe an assessment if a swath of subjects is hard for her. Does she have an LD or ADHD and need support for it for example?)", "Absolutely.
