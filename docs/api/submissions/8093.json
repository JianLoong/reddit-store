She was really stressed for it, which I would attribute to her not being super strong in the humanities. She knew this exam was going to be challenging for her, though, so she studied her ass off. She still didn't feel like she was getting it, and I could tell she was putting in effort, so I hired a tutor for a session around a day before the exam. She was still rough.\n\nI told her she could only do her best, and no matter what, we'd figure it out. I was proud of her for getting over her anxiety and just putting in work, as she often has avoidance issues.\n\nYou can imagine my pleasure when, after she returns from the exam, I get an CC'd on an email from her teacher, we'll call her Mrs. Roberts. It said \"I just wanted to assure you that I took a cursory glance at the test, and though the last short answer question I can see is wrong, it seems like you are on track to do just as well as everyone else\". My daughter was overjoyed, because when she came back from the test, she said she really wasn't sure how it went.\n\nToday, my daughter came home in tears. She explained that she got a 65% on her midterm, and she didn't know how she could've done so badly. I really didn't care about the email at that point because I just wanted to comfort her.\n\nWhen Mrs. Roberts called me to discuss the results, I had a very cordial conversation with her in which I explained that my daughter had studied, and clearly we needed to come up with a better way for her to be successful in Law and Gov. I in no way blame the teacher for my daughter's grade - that's not what bothered me.\n\nI mentioned (and I was really trying my best not to sound bitchy) that I would prefer next time if she would refrain from telling my daughter anything before she had fully graded, just incase something like this might happen. She got really defensive, and said that she never promised us anything and that even if my daughter was upset, it was on;y her own fault for not studying (which, again, I never put any blame on her for my daughter's issues with the class). I defended my daughter, reiterating she had studied, but Mrs. Roberts responded with \"Well, I didn't see any evidence of that\".\n\nIt ended really awkwardly and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was overreacting. AITA?\n\n\\*Edit: I should clarify a few things: one, I did mess up in not getting her a tutor sooner. That's totally on me and was a bad parenting move. Two, my daughter does normally advocate for herself, but both the email and phone call were initiated by Mrs. Roberts. I do not believe in doing everything for her at 17, but there was established communication between me and the teacher due to issues in the past.", "created_utc": 1674495111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ji4us/aita_for_telling_my_daughters_teacher_she/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sucks that that strategy ended up backfiring and doesn't work for your daughter - but it sounds like you may have been unreasonably irritated by what was clearly an accidental misjudgment.\n\nThe teacher should not have reacted defensively to the feedback that her strategy doesn't work well for your daughter.
