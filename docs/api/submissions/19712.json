This has got to be part of a bigger communication issue. I'd ask him how does he think you should have handled it? Take him to the side because of spinach?", "I need more details. I feel like maybe dad is the bad cop always making them eat spinach and you\u2019re the good cop always letting them get away with the bare minimum. If you had said too much food I would be on your side but too much spinach sounds like you\u2019re the pushover. My brother is like this. He folds to the kids desires and his wife has to be the tough one making them eat veggies or brush teeth. I\u2019m reserving judgement till I see more details.", "Definitely not the AH.  He needs to take a step back and really figure out why he felt the way he did.  Maybe talk to him and ask him... To me it seems maybe his parents argued a lot in front of him so hes taking it too far in his own life.", "NTA children should see disagreements and how to healthily handle them.", "NTA, unless he has adopted the boys he is not their father. You're not undermining anything.

Even if they need help scooping or portioning, it would be a good learning experience. Plus that gets away from this weird power struggle your husband and you seem to have. The fact that this is even an issue leads me to believe that the kids are forced to clean their plates and not be wasteful, which can lead to disordered eating in adults because they aren\u2019t taught to stop eating when full and naturally regulate.", "It's also important for kids to see that parents make mistakes too. \"Parent are always right\", and, \"adults have to be perfect\" are dangerous lessons for kids to internalize.", "Yeah, I agree. There are some *kinds* of disagreements that should not be had in front of children, and anything acrimonious is completely inappropriate, but\u2026 unless you really downplayed what happened here, disagreements like \u201cI think that might be too much spinach for little Murgatroyd\u201d are harmless, and productive if handled correctly.
