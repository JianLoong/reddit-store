Let\u2019s call them Mark (25m), Jeff (25m), and Sam (24f). We all met through our \u201ccohort\u201d at work. Our main circle of friends is people we\u2019ve met through our cohort. Mark and I play soccer in a rec league & have made some other friends that way, Jeff is involved with his church\u2019s youth programs so has made friends that way, while Sam\u2019s hobbies are more solitary (reading, watching TV, puzzles).\n\nHer \u201cintroverted nature\u201d has caused us to have a few issues before, I would have plans with one of our mutual friends and go to leave, she\u2019d be in our living room watching TV and ask where I\u2019m going, then ask if she could tag along. I\u2019d either say yes and not get to have the one on one time with a friend that I wanted, or tell her \u201cactually I was really hoping to get some one on one time with them\u201d and she\u2019d \u201cunderstand\u201d but be upset. \r  \n\r  \nPart of the issue is that instead of inviting others to do something, she waits to be invited to things, then gets upset when invitations don\u2019t come. But another factor is that she can rub people the wrong way - the main reason being that she seemingly can\u2019t go 10 minutes without connecting a conversation to the fact that she studied abroad in France (for a semester, then for 3 weeks in the summer). \r  \n\r  \nYou mention flowers, she talks about \u201cin Lyon, they\u2026\u201d, talk about movies and \u201cthe theatres in France..\u201d, it always comes off very \u201cI\u2019d rather be in France where life is better and people were classier\u201d. And tbh, most of our social circle has studied abroad (IR type job)  at some point and has stories like that, a few of our friends have mentioned to me that they\u2019re sick of hearing her talk about how much better France is than here.\r  \n\r  \nIt all came to a head last Sunday when Mark and I were playing soccer, Jeff was at brunch with his church friends, and Sam woke up to find herself alone. She asked me to go on a walk later that day and told me she felt alone and abandoned in the morning, we were all gone and she didn\u2019t know where we were and thought we were all hanging out with mutual friends without her. That her college roommate would do the same thing (hang out with mutual friends and not invite her or tell her) and how she \u201ccouldn\u2019t go through that again.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt a bit like she was acting upset with me for daring to hang out \u201con my own\u201d with people outside my household, so I told her \u201cwell maybe if you made plans yourself instead of just asking to tag along to ours, you wouldn\u2019t feel so much like this. And maybe if you could go a single hour without talking about how great your program in France was, more people would ask to hang out with you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe clammed up after I said that, so I assured her that we all still like her as a housemate and like hanging out with her, but that sometimes we\u2019ve got other stuff going on which is normal.

Look, I think everyone that\u2019s met someone like Sam will agree that Sam sounds annoying and stuck in the past but let\u2019s not pretend that you weren\u2019t incredibly rude to her here. I think it\u2019s semi-toxic that you and your roommates apparently all find Sam annoying but none of you mentioned those grievances until you decided to snap at her when she was clearly feeling vulnerable. \n\n>She asked me to go on a walk later that day\n\nWell, how about that? Sam tried to make plans and you immediately shut her down and made her feel like crap.", "ESH. You're working age roommates, not siblings or freshmen in college. She should be putting in effort into nurturing her own relationships and friendships. She can be introverted and shy, but that's just a life skill she needs to develop \n\nHowever, if you're going to hang out with mutual friends to places you know she'd also enjoy.. why does she need to ask to tag along every time? Why is she not invited as the default? My friends ask me to go hang out with them and their own friends who are absolute strangers to me if they think it's something I'd enjoy. I do the same for them. Are any of you.. actually friends with her? It sure doesn't sound like it.\n\nI'm almost tempted to say Y T A, in fact, as your description of her (introverted and doesn't invite people to anything) seems at odds with her actions (always wanting to join in, and flat out asking you to do things together). I suspect you simply dislike her and are thus uncharitable in how you describe her to other people, but don't have the courage to say \"sorry, but I don't actually see you as a friend\".", "YTA for how you said it. There was a gentler way to go there. She was trying to connect to the stories, and clearly isn't the social butterfly the others in the group are.\n\nIf she is a friend, maybe try planning things that gear towards the areas she shines. If she were just a roommate it would be different. But it seems you consider her a friend and could be more sensitive to her feelings.", "NTA - She sounds a little socially awkward and perhaps insecure, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s leaning on those travel stories because she thinks that is the most interesting thing about herself.  \n\nShe also seems a little lonely and needy, and you\u2019re not doing anything wrong by saying that you sometimes want to hang out with people outside of the social circle she is a part of.  She might feel hurt by not being included, but she has no right to be.  \n\nI\u2019d suggest being a little gentler with your words, perhaps, but being someone\u2019s roommate doesn\u2019t mean they get to dictate your friendships or feee time.  You\u2019re NTA.", "ESH.\n\nShe's failing to read the room and imposing herself where she's not wanted, which is unfortunate, but it's hard to tell if you've communicated adequately that it's unwanted. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and say that she sucks too. But...\n\nI couldn't help but notice that she reached out to you to do something together and you promptly took that opportunity to shit on her.\n\nSure, she's annoying, but you are all acting like children, talking about her behind her back and trying to avoid inviting her to things.\n\nYou told her something necessary in the cruelest possible way, and I personally thinks that makes you a lot worse than her. Like, a *lot*. \n\nBased on what you've said, she's a lonely introvert with social anxiety who has *one* thing that she's proud of and thinks is interesting, and clings to it as a topic of conversation because she fears not being liked or being considered boring. (Note that her fears are fair, considering her so-called friend wrote a reddit post where the disdain for her introverted hobbies was clear.) \n\nInstead of trying for an ounce of empathy or understanding, or trying to have a productive conversation with her about her social habits and the effects they're having, you stew in your petty hatred until you have the opportunity to blow up at her while she's being emotionally vulnerable. You sound like a bully to me, OP.", "NTA. You could have been nicer but people who constantly talk about their travel are miserable people to be around. Seriously insufferable. \n\nOf course it\u2019s nice to reminisce but if someone peaked over a semester abroad in college, I feel sad for them. Life has so much more to offer than three months abroad when they were 19.", "ESH- she sounds like she needs more work/help socializing, especially being introverted. still extremely not cool to invite herself to hang outs then get upset when people say no. \nwhile what you said was the truth, you said it unnecessarily harshly. no one is going to be responsive when talked to like that.", ">she seemingly can\u2019t go 10 minutes without connecting a conversation to the fact that she studied abroad in France \n\n\nI stopped reading here.  We all know these people.  They are insufferable.\n\nFor this fact alone, NTA.", "How is her relating Lyon to flowers or movies to theaters in France at all saying \u201cI\u2019d rather be in France where life is better and people are classier\u201d? She clearly had a good and memorable time there, it sounds like she\u2019s simply relating that warm memory to her conversations. I get it can be repetitive, but nowhere in the post did it sound like she was trying to say everything is classier in France. ESH because she should not be guilt tripping you for doing your own things, but I think you should\u2019ve been nicer with your approach about her repetitiveness because the \u201cmaybe if you could go a single hour without talking about France\u201d comment was incredibly rude & unnecessary.", "That is a pretty darn harsh thing to say without any precursor asking her to please stop mentioning France. You insulted her twice in one sentence as a response to her telling you how she felt.\n\nBut she does need to learn social skills and not expect to just tag along with everyone to everything. So I'm going to go ESH", "NTA. You did her a favor, she is mad now but later in life she will be happy that someone said something", "NTA - Sometimes wake up calls don't feel so hot but it needed to be said.", ">the main reason being that she seemingly can\u2019t go 10 minutes without connecting a conversation to the fact that she studied abroad in France\n\nOooooh boy lmao.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019d rather be in France where life is better and people were classier\u201d\n\nWell she's not wrong tho lol, we are classier. 8)\n\n>a few of our friends have mentioned to me that they\u2019re sick of hearing her talk about how much better France is than here.\n\nBut why? France is SO much better, duh.\n\nOk ok I'll stop my \"french superiority\" sarcasm here now lol. I'd say NTA because yes, it is really annoying when someone do that. A wake-up call was clearly needed. But imo since you said she's introverted, maybe that\u2019s the only thing she thought of to bond with you guys since a lot of you studied abroad too.\n\nBut yeah she have no right to be pissed because you do things without her. She's your roommate, not your siamese twin. It's up to her to make plans and meet new people instead of just constantly tag along.", "NTA. Sam sounds quite immature and really needs to work on her social skills. She also sounds entitled. You told her the truth about her behavior and how you felt. If she chooses not to talk to you, then it's her problem. Hopefully, she will get the message and grow up.", "YTA, and you sound like a PMAB too.", "YTA Jesus bro she just wanted to go for a walk and you gunned her down with an apache", "YTA- You were fine When you mentioned that she should branch out and Make her own plans. But you turned into the AH when you brought up the France-talk, which sounds understandably annoying, but that wasn't under the discussion topic at the time. And it just seems like OP threw that in because you wanted to say it. Have been waiting to say it I'm guessing for a while.", "YTA", "So she got out of her comfort zone, invited you (SHE invited YOU) for a walk where she tried to be vulnerable, and you let loose an annoyance you\u2019ve apparently been holding in for the entire friendship? YTA.\n\nLook, that sounds annoying as hell. She needs to learn when her France anecdotes aren\u2019t needed, and she needs to stop inviting herself to things and figure out her place socially. But here\u2019s how a friend brings up an issue: \u201cSam, I\u2019m really sorry your feelings were hurt. I just don\u2019t feel the need to include the whole friend group in every plan, as I believe a diverse group of friends and strong individual relationships with each of them are important. Have you tried reaching out to initiate plans? It can sometimes be hard if only one friend is doing the planning.\u201d\nSeparately: \u201cI know you probably haven\u2019t noticed this, but you do have a tendency to bring up France a lot. I know it\u2019s because you loved it so much - and we\u2019re glad to hear about that! But I think it may be over-saturating our conversation topics a bit. I\u2019m really sorry if that hurts your feelings, but I\u2019m giving you the truth because intimacy requires conflict, and I consider us good friends who can handle it and grow.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
