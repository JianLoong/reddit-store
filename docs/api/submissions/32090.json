He's a father and a husband already, not a mama's boy.", "NTA He feels guilty because he hasn\u2019t been with her in eight years? That\u2019s nuts. The entire point of raising children is that they are supposed to become independent and go off and have their own lives.

Be kind and be firm that you've decided that her leaving is what's best for you. Assure her you will not interfere with any future contact she may have with her son and honor your word.

He chose you, did not choose his mother.  One day, he needs to realize he has chosen you and although he will always have a strong connection to his born family, a spouse is who he chose and should come first.  You\u2019re now a team and growing your own family.", "I think it should be noted that I purposely only cook enough for my family. I don\u2019t cook extra anymore because I\u2019m not going to feed her when she has two hands to cook her own food", "boo.  That old wives tale does not apply here... MIL is an asshole, clearly trying to ruin the relationship. And if husband doesn't grow a spine, MIL might just succeed. \n\nOP, lay down the law to your husband. His job is now to his family, that means YOU. If mom can't be respectful, she needs to GO. \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s not a bad idea as long as you follow through.

I really mean it this time!\u201d So on and so forth. \n\nThere need to be real consequences, i.e. you tell her on suchandsuch date that you WILL be changing the locks and will not be giving her a key so she better have her situation ready to go by then. Your husband needs to be the one that informs her of this but you need to be the one to go get the new lock and install it unless he shows you that he\u2019s done it (hubby might chicken out). As much as it sucks that she wouldn\u2019t take your word for it, you and I both know that deep down she thinks she\u2019ll be able to manipulate your husband into caving. And she might be right. Your husband needs to work on growing a shiny spine. \n\nThis may sound extreme but I know her type. All the signs are there. I\u2019ve seen too many times that people deal with a mother in law like this with kid gloves hoping she\u2019ll respond to politeness and civility because that\u2019s how NORMAL people respond. MIL\u2019s like this are not normal people. Please please please read some of the stories on that sub if you haven\u2019t already. I have a feeling you\u2019ll see a lot of familiar situations.", "This is probably why she ignores you. If you\u2019re willng to extend an olive branch, maybe make her some food next time. \n\nIf not, your husband needs to choose, you or moms.

I hope everything works out for you!", "Your story resonated with me.  I\u2019d asked my mil to live with us. We even bought a larger home for her mom and son so we\u2019d be able to take care of everybody. Yea, so I asked her momma to live with us, knowing we didn\u2019t have a good relationship. Did it for my wife and the idea that we are supposed to care for our parents. After moving into the new house, I began to notice how conversations would change when I came into the room, how my then wife would respond to me, excluded from financial and household decisions. We are now divorced. I\u2019d wanted to move her mother out years ago. Looking back I wish I would have moved her out once the disrespect and manipulation started. Friends said if I\u2019d have moved her out it would end our marriage. Well, our marriage ended anyway. I regret putting up with the BS for as long as I did. Also, looking back. Everyone knew she was a terrorist, and they were happy she was in our, not theirs.", "NTA Either she moves out or you do. He clearly isn\u2019t standing up for you to her.

Hubby needs a reminder that 1) YOU\u2019RE his wife. You and your kids\u2019 comfort comes first in your home. 2)He\u2019s an adult so of course he hasn\u2019t been with her in that many years, and 3) You\u2019ve been more than accommodating to him regarding his mom, and it\u2019s time his focus is on you, your kids, and y\u2019all\u2019s needs. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for a good old fashioned ultimatum.

Allowed mil to move in in a pinch situation that was supposed to be temporary. Took nearly five years to get her out bc she basically took over.", "Why did you agree to let her move in?  You tell her she has to move. It is your house too", "NTA mil is making her own bed so let her lay in it.

Definitely NTA", "NTA. Your home should be your sanctuary and currently that is not that case. You have a husband problem. The fact that she\u2019s still allowed to treat you this way AND she\u2019s now living with you is ridiculous. Your husband needs to grow a pair and protect his wife\u2019s sanity. MIL needs to go.
