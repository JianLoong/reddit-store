He is absolutely allowed to foster a relationship with his mother, but NOT at the expense of his relationship with you. She\u2019s got to go. You should not feel like a stranger in your own home. Home is where you are supposed to be the most at peace. \n\nBtw, please check out the sub r/justnomil. They have a lot of good advice there.

He lives with her and you go elsewhere. NTA", "NTA & if he\u2019s feeling so guilty, he can go with her!", "NTA\n\n>because he hasn\u2019t been with her\n\nWhat? He's a father and a husband already, not a mama's boy.", "NTA He feels guilty because he hasn\u2019t been with her in eight years? That\u2019s nuts. The entire point of raising children is that they are supposed to become independent and go off and have their own lives. He\u2019s not supposed to be with her, he supposed to be with his wife and children. If mother-in-law is treating you badly, she can\u2019t stay there. His first allegiance has to be to you and the children.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not acceptable for you to be treated so disrespectfully in your own home, regardless of his guilt this needs to be resolved. If he wanted her to stay he needed to mediate ages ago and insist she is at least civil. \n\nMIL needs to go.", "You have a husband problem my friend. Tell him she needs to go. He can help her find a place but you and the kids should be his priority.", "NTA. You\u2019re his wife. She had 18 years with him.", "You went from NC to her living with you? Ok\u2026\nYour husband needs to have your back and make sure your MIL is aware that you are number one. For sure kick her out. NTA.", "Definitely NTA!

I understand your frustration, it is too much for you. She has to go.", "NTA", "NTA. She can either treat you like a human and actually help like she claims she would or she can leave.

You could give him a day or two to process the idea and make his move. And if he doesn't make one, you might offer to be the boot with him sitting in on the conversation, but explain that you're going to have that conversation with her with or without him. \n\nAllow yourself to come off to MIL as the A and take care of the situation. Be kind and be firm that you've decided that her leaving is what's best for you. Assure her you will not interfere with any future contact she may have with her son and honor your word. Lots of women don't like their DIL for one reason or another, there's no reason you shouldn't kindly suggest she feel that way about you for the sake of taking back your home.", "NTA\n\nPut your foot down and tell him to tell her to go. If he won't do it yourself and tell him to go with her.", "There\u2019s an old wives tale that says you can\u2019t have 2 women in a household and I totally believe it.

Be prepared to leave should he choose her.", "Thank you. \nWith just having our 2nd baby. I thought I might be Asshole since I wasn\u2019t being considerate of his feelings. But I\u2019ve been considering giving him a time frame because I can\u2019t be like this till he\u2019s ready to tell her.", "Agree, there is a difference between the family you choose and family you don\u2019t choose.  He chose you, did not choose his mother.  One day, he needs to realize he has chosen you and although he will always have a strong connection to his born family, a spouse is who he chose and should come first.  You\u2019re now a team and growing your own family.", "I think it should be noted that I purposely only cook enough for my family. I don\u2019t cook extra anymore because I\u2019m not going to feed her when she has two hands to cook her own food", "boo.  That old wives tale does not apply here... MIL is an asshole, clearly trying to ruin the relationship. And if husband doesn't grow a spine, MIL might just succeed. \n\nOP, lay down the law to your husband. His job is now to his family, that means YOU. If mom can't be respectful, she needs to GO. \n\nNTA", "That\u2019s not a bad idea as long as you follow through. I\u2019ve found that in situations like these, they always move the goalposts. The deadline comes around and they say, \u201cgive me just a few more weeks!\u201d A few weeks rolls around and they say, \u201cjust a few more weeks! I really mean it this time!\u201d So on and so forth. \n\nThere need to be real consequences, i.e. you tell her on suchandsuch date that you WILL be changing the locks and will not be giving her a key so she better have her situation ready to go by then. Your husband needs to be the one that informs her of this but you need to be the one to go get the new lock and install it unless he shows you that he\u2019s done it (hubby might chicken out). As much as it sucks that she wouldn\u2019t take your word for it, you and I both know that deep down she thinks she\u2019ll be able to manipulate your husband into caving. And she might be right. Your husband needs to work on growing a shiny spine. \n\nThis may sound extreme but I know her type. All the signs are there. I\u2019ve seen too many times that people deal with a mother in law like this with kid gloves hoping she\u2019ll respond to politeness and civility because that\u2019s how NORMAL people respond. MIL\u2019s like this are not normal people. Please please please read some of the stories on that sub if you haven\u2019t already. I have a feeling you\u2019ll see a lot of familiar situations.", "This is probably why she ignores you. If you\u2019re willng to extend an olive branch, maybe make her some food next time. \n\nIf not, your husband needs to choose, you or moms. Hopefully he\u2019s smart enough to make the right one.\n\nNta", "I\u2019ve been reading and can totally relate to the stories. Thank you", "No problem! I hope everything works out for you!"]}
