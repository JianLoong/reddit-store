We had gotten the cat as a \"family cat\" 3 years ago when she was a kitten. That's how it was pitched and agreed upon. The cat and my 7 year old dog get along famously, I get ring notifications numerous times a day of them playing with each other in the living room, or snuggling against each other on the couch. They share a great bond. \nThe child, now back from college on summer break but living 25 miles away with her mother, is insisting that it is \"her\" cat and always has been. She insists that she is coming to my house to take the cat \"soon\", and that she plans to register her as an emotional support animal \"to avoid pet rent\" at whatever apartment she is getting near campus in the fall.\nI have grown very fond of this cat since we got her, and enjoy her snuggles any time I sit or lay down. She is attached to my hip when I am not at work, even more so than the dog is. And I really don't want to break the bond that the cat has with the dog and myself. I'm also extremely concerned about the child's ability to care for the cat. She has never once changed the litter box, or even fed the animal. It was always me or her mother doing the care, and now it has been just me for 7 months. Financially, she would never be able to afford veterinarian care for the cat ongoing, let alone for any emergency that might arise. The vet records are all in my name, and I've payed for them all over the past 3 years. The child doesn't live here anymore, but still has some belongings here. Her mother's name is on the deed but not the mortgage, and she also has some belongings here still. We have agreed that I keep the house but buy out her equity in it.

I'm an atty, and, while I don't know your jurisdiction, and have not encountered such a case ever, I put something together for a friend awhile back, I'll paste it below. \n\nI will say, having the animal chipped is def in your favor, but can be overcome. I don't know what jurisdiction you are in, but if there is a question of ownership, it will prob be \"Small Claims Court\" or your local equivalent, before a single judge; (2) any judge on this situation will look primarily to indicia of ownership, including: \n\n- if you bought the dog, who paid for it?\n\n- is there ownership paperwork? If so, whose name is on it? \n\n- if you have pet licensing near you, or available online, that might be something to pay for in the event you have neither of the above. It is hardly strong, but if you can say you registered the cat before she stole it or something, that has a bit of weight. \n\n- I assume you have taken it to the vet and there is a record of what you paid? You can get a copy if you need it;\n\n- chipping is great obv, but not necesarily dispositive;\n\n- proof you fed the animal and sheltered the animal. They left x date. They did not take the cat at that time. You have paid for cat food and cat \n litter all that time. They cannot prove otherwise. Keep receipts going forward of cat food purchases or anything else for your cat  Safeway Club Card printouts used to be available. Maybe still are?\n\n- it has been more than half-a-year. See if your state has a period of time after which an animal is considered abandoned. If nothing, check what the period of time is for property. You can argue that, in the alternative, if the judge looks like they are buying her argument, you may be able to argue that she abandoned the animal by leaving it at your home for 6+ mos. \n\n- don't forget photos with time stamps. A good sampling from your Ring photos would be great. Cute ones with the dog snuggling.\n\n- anyone know that you primarily took care of the the feeding and cat litter? Maybe they will swear out a declaration.\n\nIf you show up to court with a bunch of this stuff, you will overwhelm her. \n\nOh, one more thing -- she doesn't have the facts, so she will likely use overt appeals to emotion, combined with lies to try to convince the court. \n\nYou need to consider whether this is a way for your ex to get back at you. I would encourage you to use that to frame your defense. It will remove sympathy, at least, and you hav the much better facts.", "While you may not be able to change your locks, you're still expected to have a certain level of privacy. It's not unreasonable to lay down some ground rules expecting them to not intrude while you're not at home. If your ex isn't living there and is registered at another address, that'll help you. As will the fact you've got proof of ownership of the cat by the vet bills.   \nAs will probably be suggested by others, get a doorbell cam that alerts when someone is outside. If the daughter still decides to try her hand at catnapping, you have more than enough to call the police on her.", "What is the worst that could happen if you change the locks? If it is some fine, I would take this risk for the safety of the pets.", "I\u2019d still change them.", "Thankfully that was a few years ago and was the tip of the iceberg of crap they pulled.  I don't have to deal with any of that anymore .", "If you're going through a legal separation process, don't get a second attorney just make it very clear in your separation agreement who has possession of both animals (just for clarity). Most/many jurisdictions consider pets property so just add them in to the agreement.", "If it\u2019s part of the mediation, expect them to want money or something else in exchange to let you have the cat. Some people are masters at manipulating others\u2019 emotions to get more, even if they don\u2019t really care in the first place.", "That doesn't mean the ex or the child has unfettered access to the house at all times in most jurisdictions, and, if it typically does in yours, the child's threats to put the animals at risk could change that.", "Is your agreement regarding the house in writing, as in a notarized document of some sort? \n\nIf it is, check with your lawyer if that is enough to be able to change the locks, bc this would force your both your ex and SD to only visit the house when you are there to open the door.\n\nI know you've been told you couldn't but this is probably the kind of things that differs from one state to another. In my country, if the document regarding the distribution of shared assets is already surrendered to the court house, even if the divorce isn't finished yet, this means both parties have declared their intentions regarding the assets, and the party that keeps the house can change locks. \n\nAgain, this is an anecdotal report based on my experience on my country (not US), and it's why I suggest you talk to your lawyer if you are in possession of such document.\n\nAs for the cat, it is chipped and in your name, and if it wasn't mentioned in the divorce agreement, it's yours. She's being a brat, don't let her ruin the quality of life of your furry friend.\n\nFinal note: You, sir, owe this sub the Cat Tax.", "Well if everything you said is true than NTA again. The cat obviously has a happy established home with you and your dog and you have the financials. If the relationship with the daughter is not salvageable then do what you need to keep kitty safe. Just try not to do anything that\u2019ll ruin your relationship with your stepson", "Hopefully, that\u2019s how the court will see it.", "Absolutely this is prime advice.", "I have 12 ring cameras throughout the house, with 5 outside. I put them up after they left in November because of threats by them to take things that are mine.", "Only text messages, nothing notarized. But I will definitely get on that asap. Great reply, and thank you for such a well thought out and well reasoned response.", "Thanks. I'm trying to maintain that delicate balance, but I know that they are blood and she's his little sister, so it's a tough path to navigate. He's a lot like me and is very rational and even-keeled. She is much more driven by emotions, which is why we are at this juncture.", "I would think the court (if it came to that) would first ask who's been financially responsible for the cat over the years. That would probably provide the answer.", "I'd say you're more than covered then!   \n\n\nBest of luck in this crappy situation. Fingers crossed it's done and dusted soon so the cat's 100% safe and you don't have to worry about entitled stepkids.", "It should be part of the divorce decree", "Thank you! I'm hoping for quick and easy and I'm the rearview"]}
