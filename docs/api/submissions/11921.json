ESH mostly because I'm biased in the fact that pulling the power cable isn't the best thing for an expensive thing as a computer, and I think this obviously needs to be solved in some other way than just pulling the plug whenever it becomes too much.\n\nBut NTA based on what you write further. You had agreements, he broke it. As an outsider it seems quite obvious that your husband has a gaming addiction, he can't control his temprament or his addiction to these games. Unfortunately, this won't be solved by making an agreement of saying \"you should stop\". He'll agree to it to keep the peace like all other addictions, you can imagine something like \"I promise to never touch another glass of alcohol ever again\". It's possible, but unlikely. The only way he has through it is to actually go to some kind of therapy and deal with it for real. He needs tools that can help him limit himself in his gaming, and how invested he gets in these games. Honestly he sounds like me when I was 14-15, I was playing Counter-Strike all night long with my friends, I was screaming, raging and everyone around felt the tremors of it. My wake-up call was when my teachers said they were considering failing me on my classes because of my poor attendance and lackluster work, and I just thought \"fuck I can't be the person who can't get through grade school because I'm playing games\". Nowadays I still play a lot of games, sometimes I have nights here and there where I play to 2-3 am, but it's rare. It goes in waves, so sometimes I just accept that I'll have some periods where my gaming is a bit more intense, but in general I try to remind myself that I want to take care of myself, my career, friends and my body first-hand.\n\nYou need to make up your mind if this is something you can deal with while he's recovering from this. Because I was in a similar situation, not only with gaming addiction but my partner also had depression and the amount of toxicity and the vile ways he treated me and our relationship was honestly shit. But I endured because I kept telling myself \"he needs my help, if I'm well, I should be able to take the hits until he gets better\". But honestly it pulled me so far deep that it wasn't until I was out of that relationship I realized how I had let him treat me, and that mental illness is not entirely an excuse to let me feel like shit about myself. \n\nThis might be a little odd, but I love this monologue from Todd from Bojack Horseman and it helped me on my journey to let people find their own ways a bit:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohoLzH9EQzg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohoLzH9EQzg)\n\nWhile I don't agree with him fully, as in I think we can be empathetic that some things are out of our control, what I do agree with is that people are still adults and you need to be accountable for actions, regardless where they're coming from. And that sometimes people too quickly hide behind external reasons instead of just owning up to what they're doing to themselves and people around them.", "NTA\n\nbut riddle me this did you see this behaviour in the 8 years you've been together? is this a new situation?\n\nEither way I would run.", "Looks like the other comments have this covered.", "NTA he needs professional help, right now keep your distance until he gets better and earns you back.\n\nMy little brother, as a tween-teen, had more self-control and anger management than this.", "lol if this story is accurate your husband has got issues.

He decides to call the police for \u201cdomestic violence\u201d saying I was isolating him \ud83d\ude44 I left the next day", "My husband is a good man, a real nice guy. His gaming alter-ego is an ahole.  Total antagonist in his role playing games. Arguing with everyone.  It\u2019s how he releases the energy, I guess.  More than 20 years together and he never once cursed at me or disrespected me.   THAT is the difference here.  Your husband is the same in and out of the game if he cursed you out.  Lack of respect.  Many signs of no respect actually- mine would turn off the computer at a reasonable hour when we had the computer in our room.", "ESH. Him for ignoring you and his anger issue. You for your anger issue (literally cutting the cord, really?).", "I had to recheck the age when I was done with this post, and I still can't believe it's about a husband. An adult man who managed to get married... he sounds like a toddler throwing tantrums, abusive, and generally kind of unstable. NTA but like one of the commenters have said, demand that he gets help for anger management and gaming addiction, or tell him he doesn't have to come back ever and send him divorce papers. This isn't okay.", "NTA.  I would mute his text for a while and ask his parents to talk to him. This is strange behavior.  Wonder if something happened to him or an unknown condition is showing up.  They likely are as confused as you are", "I'm going to be very unpopular, but apparently no one else sees the irony here.\n\nHe releases stress by playing video games. It may be a slight inconvenience because he's yelling and being loud, but ultimately, he's not taking anything out on you or your family. \n\nYou, however, have consciously acted maliciously toward him. Your actions had purpose. You chose, out of spite, to cut off the power supply. You judged him for his anger (breaking a keyboard) and took it one step further (cutting off the power supply \"in a moment of rage.\") \n\nHe had a healthy outlet for stress, and you decided it wasn't good enough. \n\nGross.\n\nYTA", "Info: do you not have anyone besides reddit to ask this to?\n\nhow would he not see you going and cutting the cable ?\n\n\n Anyone in the world would say N T A", "ESH y\u2019all need a timeout. Cutting cables slamming keyboards should be a sign. Crying from a cut cable points to bigger issues on hubbies side. However, something is causing tremendous stress and the need to hide behind the keyboard. Time for counseling", "Info: what kind of abhorrent things?  What nasty names?", "OK normally I'd say you're TA, but in this case I think your husband has a gaming addiction (and anger issues if he screams and destroys his keyboard in rage)... and shouting at night while you try to sleep makes him the AH, especially since you talked about it.\n\nHe should see a therapist and talk about his gaming habits.\n\nNTA.", "I'm in my 40s and often stay up late to game or read. I'm a night owl. However, I do not scream, because other people live here. At most, I squeal quietly.", "OP said her husband plays Mario Party. Like everyone else has said, I also thought he was playing Call of Duty or something. This is so crazy over Mario Party. Sorry, OP. I hope you either find a way to get him help or just leave him if he refuses.", "NTA, what I just read OP is seriously off putting. And the abusive texts just make that worse.", "I agree! This could get dangerous fast! It\u2019s scary that he behaved like that and I wonder why the heck his parents let him stay there too. If my son did that I wouldn\u2019t enable that behavior. He\u2019d be on his own!", "He's definitely looking at other sources or outlets that don't involve her.  If it were me, I would wonder if this exaggerated behavior is to impress someone or other group of people.  His abusive behavior is also a predictor of future health not just to the husband but to the wife and relationship as a whole.\n\nHe has already participated in spousal abuse and can only wonder what the next level is.  I would be concerned if he were abused in early childhood or his parents or instigators of dysfunction.\n\nHere's a good article I found https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3411865/", "Or he can leave. She shouldn't vacate the home when he's the one being abusive.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not normal behaviour for an adult. Staying up late is one thing, staying up and being disruptively loud is another, and refusing to change the behaviour when asked is ridiculous. \n\nThe cutting the cable was pretty shitty and in any other context I'd say damaging someone's stuff isn't okay but I see why you did. But I think you need to examine his behaviour and why he feels this is reasonable. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "I can't imagine acting this way as a grown ass adult over Mario Party, a game which is designed to be completely random and nowhere near entirely based on skill. Even the one who always wins the mini games can still lose the overall game to someone who barely won any mini games. Or even a computer player on \"Normal\" mode. Smh. Dude needs way more than couples counseling, he needs addiction therapy.", "I\u2019m a gamer and I\u2019d probably ugly cry if I lost a bunch of progress, so I get that, but I wouldn\u2019t be up so late on a week night screaming, or reacting violently to a game. At this point he needs to see a therapist.", "His behavior is abusive.  Do not seek couple's counseling in an abusive situation.\n\nIndividual only.", "good news i dont think this is real unless this person has no one in their life to talk to , no one is going to think shes being unreasonable", "I think OP said she cut off his power supply cable. That's not the same as turning off the game.", "I'd associate smashing the keyboard with a preteen.", "Especially if he's only started this lately, and hasn't been this excessive about gaming prior to this.", "I had an ex like this. One day he was bashing his keyboard and my dog ran into our room where I was to 'dob' on him because he startled her. Note the word ex.", "Sadly my association with keyboard smashing and shouting while gaming is a 50s+ man. (My father.) Honestly, it is completely understandable reaction of OP to have NTA. But yeah the man sounds in need of therapy", "Happy cake day", "[deleted]", "In case you are actually my upstairs neighbor, please don\u2019t let him back in, I need to sleep.", "I know you /s but also according to OP it's Mario Party with his mates of all things", "Screaming at a video game until the early hours of the morning and breaking keyboards in a rage is categorically not \"a healthy outlet\".", "Fucking *Mario Party?* That's not even a skill game. You can strategize to hell and still lose because of the chaos of certian squares. This is an insane game to get worked up over.", "Squeal quietly - the mental image is adorable! I mean this in a positive way.", "On PC?", "Obviously you've never had someone Boo your coins when you're a few spaces away from buying a star.", "Mario Party is actually more understandable to me.", "From what i have gathered the game was Mario party. Yelling and screaming tends to happen alot in Mario party. Mario party is where friendships go to die.", "Yeah just to add to this - couples' counseling can be dangerous for abuse victims.  It's incredibly common for the abuse to manipulate the counselor to believe the victim is the problem,  so the counselor assists the abuser in maintaining the status quo.", "Not a helpful comment for those who are most vulnerable to abuse and post here looking for help.", "My preteen self would be insulted that you made that comparison", "You broke up with him because he bashed his keyboard? Wtf lol", "I, ah, think you might be getting to the root of the problem there. He did something awful to you, you responded, and he ran to his parents? Who hate you?\n\nOof.", "WHAAAAT?!? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 oh that's absolutely hilarious", "He plays mario party on a pc?", "This was over (checks screen) Mario Party? How is he the rest of the time? This seems like chilling behavior by a grown man who's able to land a relationship, let alone a spouse. Does he work? Like does he work in an adult job? By adult job I mean not doing chores in his own house that you have to pay him for? Is he typically this volatile towards you or just during this particular game? Do you know the people he's playing against and are they also adults or are they children?\n\nHis over the top response seems alarming for it being 2023 and he's throwing temper tantrums over (checks screen again...) Mario Party. Not to say it's okay for any game, but there's a difference between a campaign game and... Mario Party.", "A Nintendo game? The Disney of games?\n\nI cannot imagine what will happen if he gets into harder, more adult games after this one.", "Info: Mario Party isn't played with a keyboard. Are you saying that he put down his controller and grabbed a keyboard just to destroy it?\n\n(Also, it's not played on a computer, and Switches are handhelds which can withstand a power outage, but I don't know that there's a point in nitpicking there.)", "I\u2019m sorry\u2026 WHAT?!?! I can\u2019t even. I don\u2019t even know where to start unpacking this, but you are definitely NTA.", "sorry he's going nuts like this over MARIO PARTY?! Did he lose to Toad or something. Pathetic ass man.", "If you let him back film his behavior so he can see/hear how out of control he\u2019s become", "I was hesitant at first but damn.. Is your husband Nogla or something? Haha, I'm sorry, but it's kinda hilarious to hear someone is raging at mario party of all things. NTA", "\"something like this shouldn't be grounds for divorce\" are you actually delusional? That is genuine abusive behavior and 100% a reason to get tf out of dodge.", "Yeah, I saw that after the fact. I was imagining it was a campaign type game where a lot of hours and devotion were placed into it and survival of your teammates relied on you. I would never throw a temper tantrum, but I could see getting upset. But Mario Party? Either I haven't played it seriously enough or husband dude needs help. I don't want to come across as a game snob, but... really?", "What? Next thing you'll tell me the multiple holes I've left in my wall aren't a healthy outlet either", "GET REKTED KYLE YOU LUIGI ASS LOOKING MOTHERFUCKER", "Ok but hear me out, the mind-bending rage you can feel when Mario Party is going badly for you, and the degree to which you may want to murder your little brother, can\u2019t be overstated. I mean, I hear.", "That's what makes it so much more enraging tho", "Yes", "Emulators are a thing", "Yup.  BTDT.", "I was gonna say toddler, but they don't generally use mouse and keyboard.", "I'm surprised more people haven't pointed this out. He plays Mario Party on a PC with a keyboard? Last I checked the Mario Party games are Nintendo exclusive.", "Also found this odd, but apparently, Mario Party Online can be played on a pc with an emulator.", "Oh I definitely relate. I have mostly played against the cpus because no one I know wants to play and I have said some very unkind things about Mario while playing. But if you play it enough you've been up to 3am multiple times playing, you get desensitized to it. It's like, yeah. I was 5 stars ahead and bitchass Mario landed on chance and gave all my shit to Yoshi on the last turn. Oh well. New game.", "Yeah but if someone is playing it as much as OPs husband, he should understand how the game goes by now. I have played a lot of Mario Party. I go into it expecting chaos. Expecting to get screwed over. It's what makes winning a game so satisfying, too.", "Yeah but this phrase \n\n>At this point I've just had enough, and in a moment of blind rage I decided that my best option was to cut off his power suply cable.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense. They're in a blind rage and CUT the power supply cable. Um, no? You want to electrocute yourself, sure. It's also a cord not worth crying over. They're super replaceable. \n\nThe only way I can understand this being a moment of crying is if he's gambling and/or he's using Mario Party as a cover.", "Yeah I agree it\u2019s ridiculous that this is the game over which this man is losing his mind. I was just thinking I have lost my temper on this a few times. I never yelled or broke anything, however.", "What the actual fuck is this", "Wow you are not self aware at all, telling someone else about *their* high horse...", "YAWN....."]}
