That doesn't extend to breaking shit ever tho. \n\nAlso while either of us would be fucking pissed at the other one for pulling to power cable like that, neither of us would bawl or call each other nasty names. \n\nI want to be clear, your husband is emotionally abusing you sending nasty messages. There is a shit ton of therapy needed for your marriage to work long term and be happy. Otherwise divorce or a lifetime of verbal abuse are likely in your future.", "How long has this gone on? How many times have you talked about it? The night you cut his cable, how many times did you tell him to quiet down?", "Send him back laughing emojis and enjoy your peace", "NTA\n\nWow, I'm surprised that your husband doesn't realize what he has done and is doing to you. This should serve as a wake-up call - games and hobbies are important, but one should always understand that personal enjoyment should never come at the expense of someone's comfort and happiness.", "NTA", "NTA: while I think he\u2019s an adult so you shouldn\u2019t be policing him, I think he may have some sort of gaming addiction. It\u2019s affecting both of your lives now. \n\nMaybe turning up at his parents house in hysterics *over a video game* might knock some sense into him?", "ESH, obviously.", "I get you're exhausted with him, so this is literally borderline NTA but really ESH. Damaging his property isn't the answer.\n\nHe needs to grow the fuck up.\n\nYou're on the fast track for divorce. Get some counseling, both together and separate.", "NTA\n\nHave you given the book \u201cThe Explosive Child\u201d by Ross Greene a read? It\u2019s got a lot of great techniques for how to deal with toddler tantrums.", "NTA. Your husband is not a man. Get a real man that will pay attention to you. Runs to mommy's house, lol.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nhe needs therapy! Gaming addiction and anger management.\n\nHave you told his parents why he is hysterical?", "Yikes, your husband needs therapy. That\u2019s a crazy response. He sounds like a 6 year old throwing a tantrum. There must be deeper issue going on. Hopefully he can got some help and you can work things out.", "NTA... Are you sure hes not 10? Crying??? Wtf....", "NTA\n\nI don't know what the issue is, but it isn't the gaming, it isn't the power supply, and it isn't you. He's got something going on and I doubt if he knows that, or knows what it is. Until he figures out that there's something wrong and what it is, and starts taking steps to address whatever it is in a healthy way, stuff like this is going to keep boiling up around the edges of various red herrings. He needs to talk to someone.", "ESH You shouldn't have cut the cord, but I understand why you did it. If he won't change his behavior and get help with his anger and self control then you leave. I'd honestly just ignore that child tantrum and if you don't have kids block him until he can talk nicely.  Tell him it's therapy for himself and for you as a couple or ending the marriage", "NTA. He's acting like a spoiled child & It sounds like he might have some deep rooted anger/addiction issues and might need therapy. Has he ever shown this type of anger or thrown tantrums over anything else?", "NTA. There\u2019s something wrong with your husband, his behavior and reaction are both concerning", "NTA your husband has a hardcore gaming addiction and is reverting to acting like an angry teenager because of it....a 30yr old man! Just talking about it to them won't do anything. An intervention is needed because like any addiction it's an insidious problem that will end up costing him his job and meaningful relationships in his life if he doesn't get help.", "Normally id say not cool. But If hes yelling and carrying on then fair enough, he's being a tool.. pull that plug..\n\nBut.. i reckon you must have had some idea he was like that.. so i dunno.. hope yous work i out.", "ESH\n\nYeah he sounds incredibly immature, but your response wasn't exactly mature either. What did you think cutting off his power supply cable was going to accomplish? Did you really think it would actually make the situation any better?\n\nI'm thinking a divorce might be worth considering. You two clearly aren't compatible.", "NTA   \n\n\nYou need to get your husband into some sort of anger management/gaming addiction program and be direct with him that if he can't RAPIDLY change his ways you're leaving. And then you need to follow through if he can't fix what he has going on. This is not a normal way for an adult to behave. He's verbally abusive to you and showing signs of possibly being physically abusive. If you were just dating I'd tell you to run but I know divorce can be an absolute shit show for everyone involved.", "NTA. I was married to someone like that - he behaved  that way with a newborn. He never changed. Get out while you still can.", "Ohhhh you are so NTA. Take him leaving as the blessing it is and change the locks.", "?? Did you turn it off or cut the whole cord off? You used both verbs and the result is very different. \n\nIf you just turned it off, def NTA. If you cut it off...maybe ESH depending on how much time and money that costs to fix (I have NO idea)\n\nEither way, I think some counseling might be a good idea.", "NTA. Screaming over a game isn\u2019t ever acceptable. That alone is more than enough.\n\nI sometimes play games that late, the rule is if I wake my husband up, I turn it off immediately and slip in bed. I thought *that* was me being an asshole tbh.\n\nHim doubling down on it and leaving for his parents house seems like a very bad sign\u2026 I can\u2019t even relate to how he could think he\u2019s been wronged here.", "NTA. This is crazy. He has some anger issues and obviously control issues. I\u2019d question their emotional maturity to be a long term partner. This love doesn\u2019t sound unconditional.", "YTA. Your husband is a baby, but you married that baby.  This isn't new behavior that he's exhibiting. You've known about his gaming practices for years and you shouldn't expect to be able change him. You're not his parent, you don't get to tell him what to do and when to do it. It's probably annoying as hell,  but this is what you signed up for. Try sound proofing the room he games in. You could probably get him to do that for you", "NTA. Your husband needs therapy. Consider recording his outburst and making him watch it to see what he makes of it. He is almost a Jekyll and Hyde act, if he is otherwise ok.", "NTA\n\nYour husband's behaviour is very odd for a 30 year-old. I would associate smashing the keyboard with someone in their late teens, maybe early 20s. Not an adult of 30.\n\nHas he considered he is either addicted to gaming or that he has an anger management problem?", "The uncontrollable rage should be your main focus. Him, raging during his games, then raging at you for cutting his cord. And you, for getting into a \"blind rage\" and cutting his cord. Everything else is deckchairs-on-the-Titanic level bad. \n\nESH", "NTA\n\nThis man shouldn't be gaming if he's getting so mad he's breaking shit.. There's no excuse for that at all. Don't play games if you get this mad. \n\nAlso wtf, he's crying and super upset about the fact you turned off his computer? Bro? Nothings lost.. It isn't broken (unlike the keyboard) and it's not like it was the middle of the day either. \n\nThis man either needs therapy or needs to stop playing games.", "Ehh, I was gonna go with ESH here since you cut his power cable, but I'm gonna go with NTA instead.\n\nFirst of all, he sounds like a baby. I play games til late at night and curse too, but it's not normal to break things and scream the whole house awake. He seems like he completely lacks any self-awareness of what he's doing.\n\nThen he calls you nasty names and runs off to his mom? What a weirdo. He's a married, 32yo man, acting like a 12yo.\n\nAnd if he's so upset over the screwed up power cable, he can go to a hardware store or something. Power cables are super cheap too. It's not like you fried the whole power supply.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
