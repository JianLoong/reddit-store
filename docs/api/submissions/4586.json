If he's willing to commit one felony, odds are high he's willing to commit more. And did. He knowingly sold a stolen firearm. Another felony. \n\nLock away your firearms. Take a class on gun ownership, because unfortunately it sounds like you didn't receive training before purchasing firearms. Re-evaluate your storage and handling. Cooperate with the police. You screwed up, which happens and thankfully no one died. \n\nOwning a firearm has responsibilities, beyond the legal requirements.

But honestly not reporting your firearm stolen, doesn't matter if it is a legal requirement or not. You do it because it's the responsible thing to do. Plus the legally wise and situationally smart thing to do. \n\nIf someone does not have the intelligence to realize failing to report it means it's still in their name, they're incredibly stupid. If you are not mature enough to operate firearms responsibly, you need to store them away or get rid of them until you can do so.", "I mean I'm certainly not anti-gun.
