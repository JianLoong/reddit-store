Sooo after giving him like 5 hours to return it I reported it and him and then after a hour he called asking me to lie to police saying that I have it back and that he\u2019ll give me 250$ meaning he sold my brand new Glock 27 which I paid 650$ for and of course I said no figure it out and hung up. A few weeks pass by and I get a letter saying he was detained and now maybe 2 months later the \u201cfriends\u201d I called to call him posting about snitching and and screaming free him and making songs where I can clearly hear them talking about the situation. And atp I\u2019m pretty sure they had something to do with him taking it probably coerced him into doing it or something idk let me know if I\u2019m wrong or not based on y\u2019all\u2019s opinions.", "created_utc": 1670886375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zketzt/aita_for_reporting_my_gun_stolen_and_giving_the/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t leave your firearms unattended like that.", "NTA, you reap what you sow. He knew he shouldn't have done it one way or the other and these are the consequences to his actions. His  friend (*if he was in on it) would be the real asshole. Let him write his shitty songs, they both deserve anything they get.", "Nta.I feel bad for dude though  he sound like a crash dummy", "NTA. If he sold it, you didn\u2019t report it, and it was used to commit a crime you\u2019d be in a world of shit. He was a dumbass to do what he did. Especially to a friend.", "NTA\nPart of responsible gun ownership is reporting if it is stolen. It is also common sense. He was willing to commit one crime, so he really should not be armed.", "NTA asshole for calling the police and reporting the dude. \n\nBut you are the asshole leaving a firearm unattended where it could be stolen in the first place.", "It's a gun, of course you're NTA for reporting it stolen.", "YTA for the sole reason you\u2019re an irresponsible gun owner and this type of bs is how it gets into the wrong hands.

The responsible thing to do was to contact the police and report this. In the future please do not leave your firearms unattended.", "Sounds like he got what's coming. Aside, you shouldn't own guns if you think putting it on the ground, out of your sight and open to anyone walking by is ok.", "NTA\n\nFriends don't steal from each other.", "ESH because he's a thief but you're irresponsible af.", "NTA. If you steal from a friend, you can't expect that friend to remain loyal. If it were for a luxury bag or something, you could maybe make a case for not involving the police. But illegal firearms aren't used for fun, good things, and that firearm is tied to your name. You'd be a fool to let him run off with it. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA. How can he steal a gun and expect anything else to happen? This is a pretty clear FAFO situation. His stupidity is honestly astonishing.\n\nAlso yes you should always report guns stolen if they are stolen. That is what a responsible gun owner does, since that's how criminals get illegal guns in the first place. Although I do agree you shouldn't leave a weapon outside and not secured in the first place.", "Not for that but for leaving your gun on the ground and waiting 5 hours to report it? YTA x infinity\n\nBecause of you there is one more handgun on the streets. Because of you if someone is injured, by that gun, legally it may not be on you, but morally it is. I hope that keeps you up at night. \n\nI was raised around guns and this is not treating a firearm with respect. It's completely irresponsible.\n\nBut but but my cousin was there- stfu. he didn't have possession of it, by your own admission, it was left on the ground for anyone to grab. Meth is everywhere these days and meth heads can run fast as hell. You fucked up. Majorly. \n\nWhat are you gonna do when the cops tell you it was used in crime and kills someone? Say, but but I didn't mean for it to happen. Someone still died by YOUR gun. Man up, and actually be a responsible gun owner. Until then don't reproduce.", "Making songs? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "NTA.  WTF is that kid thinking? Good on you Op for doing the right thing, if you'll left the gun with the kid there's no telling what could have happened.

The idiot stole your gun, not even in a slick way, he took off running with it!!! Considering how much gun violence is happening right now you had no other choice but to immediately report it stolen.
