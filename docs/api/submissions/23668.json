{"id": 23668, "submission_id": "15fq5o0", "title": "AITA for telling my parents my brother will never find a girlfriend because of how he views women?", "selftext": "My (31F) went to my hometown for the fourth of July. Normally my older sister (33f) will come as well with all of her sorority friends but they stayed home this year. My brother (37m) would normally tag along with my sister and her friends, because a few of them are single. This year he was stuck with me, which on paper, is fine. Me and him get along kinda, but I wouldn't never call us close. \n\nSo, we met up with my friends from high school that I typically only see over the fourth and reintroduced my brother. About an hour in, my brother started making comments on girls bodies and how they all look fat when wearing high waisted clothing and he wishes they would just go back to low rise. My brother is far from attractive, but I'd never say it out loud. He's 5ft 5inches and stocky. He also dresses like an old man with pleated knee length or lower shorts and a polo basically everyday.\n\nI was actually wearing high waisted shorts and pointed it out, then asked him to stop talking about it. I've always had issues with how I saw my body, and have an eating disorder. He then started saying I'm not hiding my fat from anyone wearing them, and everyone is thinking the same thing. He started to prod my friend to join in on calling me fat, he even asked my husband flat out \"don't you think she looks disgusting and fat?\" It made everyone uncomfortable and the women in the group became very shy. He started calling me unattractive for having tattoos and again tried to get everyone to join in. One of my friends agreed he didn't like tattoos but pointed out mine all have deep meaning and aren't just random. \n\nHe continued his incel behavior by buying women drinks then when they refused, calling them fat whores. Telling us about how women need to sleep with men if the man bugs dinner. And just all of these terrible things.\n\nThe next morning my parents asked me how it went. I said it was fine but my brother took things way too far. We started talking and they said \"he just needs to find a good woman to straighten him out\". I instantly responded, he's never going to find a woman with his views.
