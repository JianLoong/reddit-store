There's definitely white worshipping in some African countries, but I'd say it's mostly African men who fetishize white women. Not a lot of (black) African women have a strong preference for white men. I say this because I had a phase in high school when I wanted to  move the West and marry a white guy because it has a status symbol back home. My crushes were on white and black boys. Very few of my classmates crushed on white guys, and my country is one of the few with a sizeable white population.

The hard truth is you don't get to have a racist mom actively in your life and date someone who is not only a person of color, but your mom's favorite to target. This is hateful behavior whether you want to admit it or not. What exactly was your plan? Keep him a secret even if you get married?
