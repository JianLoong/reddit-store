Just bc a person dates black men, and does good things for the community doesn't mean they cant still be racist. Sounds like your mom didn't like being told about herself. She knows she's racist... She just tries to convince herself she's not.", "NTA, but I would've told my mom I was dating someone and if she wanted to meet him she was gonna have to stop with the mocking voice and racist bullshit lol. How would she have felt in your position if she had been dating a black dude, and her mom was sitting around at home speaking in a \"black\" accent and making an entire persona every time a rap song came on the radio? \"I can't see color\" seems disrespectful too because if anything I feel like everyone should see color and appreciate the differences in cultures and history we all have. She may need a reality check lol.", "Nta.. your mom is racist and you're protecting your bf from her ignorant acts . ... Just because someone dated poc or did kind acts doesn't mean they're a good person and can't be racist... Just because its a joke doesn't mean its not offensive", "Yowsa, how can can someone who is great and wonderful in some areas of their life be so blindly racist in others? No, NTA, I'd be ashamed of her, too. I suppose when she was young she WASN'T considered racist, but things have evolved and racism is a lot more entrenched and subtle than just n-words and nazi flags. The problem is that this was never going to end well for you, she was going to find out, and avoidance is not a long-term strategy. I don't envy you handling it moving forward...", "NTA\n\nYou are right about your mom. You are doing the right thing by your SO, and your mom refuses to self reflect and see how her behavior is harmful and racist.", "NTA. Hopefully this acts as a bit of a wake up call. Her daughter actively hid that she was in a serious relationship out of fear she'd offend and embarrass her partner.", "NTA\n\n>My mother is racist but she refuses to admit it.\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I'm not racist I just say how things are. I cannot.", "NTA.  Her overreaction is really just the cherry on the top.  You did no wrong.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a better solution: Go no contact with your racist mom.", "Her excuse is so bs \u201coh I dated black men and give to my community so I can\u2019t be racist\u201d. She\u2019s definitely racist and honestly op I really think you should maybe go no contact with her especially if you married someone that isn\u2019t white Nta", "NTA, and I am so sorry you are going through this. She is a straight up racist, and a hypocrit at that. You are kind to want to protect your partner - your decision is the right one, and your mothers bigotry and lack of self-awareness isnt your fault.", "NTA: \n1) The word \u201cracist\u201d means different things to different people. It\u2019s not necessary to argue with her about it, but I agree with you. Her behavior sounds racist to me. \n\n2) You can introduce a SO to anyone you want on YOUR terms. Just because she\u2019s your mother. doesn\u2019t mean you have to automatically tell her about things in your life. There\u2019s no rule that says front-row-seats must be given to X people. You control the who/what/when/how/why, and that would be true even if she wasn\u2019t racist. \n\n3) It doesn\u2019t matter what the rest of the family thinks.

To be honest I would do the same thing if my mom did that type of stuff. To be honest I would go NC because she doesn't seem to want to change and probably won't . She will probably mock your bf behind your back and play victim.", "NTA.

She might not see color, but she seems to hear color. You did the right thing by telling her about your relationship. Hopefully she will seek out some education that will hopefully see how she acts (and thinks) and mocks others just because they don\u2019t look like her. She needs to stop and realize just how hateful her joking is. Good luck.", "YTA. It is one thing not to introduce BF, it is another to hide \u201clong term partner\u201d.  How long this could have gone on?  If you uncomfortable to bring you SO to your mom, you should have talk to her about it and your reasons. If all she does is mock people accents, there are much worst sins ( I do have a heavy accent and it is mildly annoying but much better than people who are perfectly correct in their behavior but make sure they do not sell you a house, hire you or let their kid date you).", "It's weird how much you can get away with when you smile and do nice things for people. She hates being told about herself because she sees herself as an angel. She loves doing things for the community because she likes the praise she gets for it and the attention so if you call her out on anything bad she has a meltdown.", "This", "She has a \"black\" accent. Everytime a back American is on TV or a rap song is on she talks in the worst \"black\" accent ever. My dad is Nigerian too and sometimes when she answers the phone to me she answers in a fake Nigerian accent. I have to just hang up", "She was raised by hardcore racists and kicked out of the family for dating outside her race so yeah she has a very 1980s lens of racism that she doesn't want to see past.\n\nI know i couldn't avoid it forever. I wasn't hoping to wait at least a couple more years until after we eloped though. I think moving forward I will just let my boyfriend decide if he wants to meet her and I will give her a chance to change. It's not gonna be pretty for sure", "Taylor swift", "I have a feeling that person is going to be me before I introduce her to me partner.", "You know there is an option of just\u2026not having to deal with a racist? It\u2019s not by force she must choose the lesser of two evils. \n\nOP had already informed her partner about her mother. If the partner didn\u2019t want to meet her either than why should she force a meeting. \n\nClearly OP and her partner are both fine with keeping them seperate.", "Sounds narcissistic. But you gotta stand your ground if you wanna keep your boyfriend. She will throw a tantrum for a while but you gotta let her know in no uncertain terms that what she is doing is in fact racism and will not be tolerated.", "Oh wow. \nI'm so sorry OP. Hopefully she realizes that for her kid to go so far to hide something like this from her as an adult that she's really fucked things up. I would definitely be taking a distant, moderately long break from her.\nAlso I'm a little shocked your dad just puts up with that, it makes me sad. I know comedians have been making fun of accents for years and some people like your mom probably don't see a problem with it but it's honestly tactless and I hope he's not hurt by it.", "Maybe look into some literature for her? Maybe even some literature for yourself on how to bring her up to speed with current beliefs in a way she's likely to take in?  I mean, kudos to her for breaking an ugly family pattern, but it's not just one and done. She took a admirable step forward, now you are just wanting her to walk further down the path she started on. Good luck(lol)!"]}
