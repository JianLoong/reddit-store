I get along well with all my roommates, we can kick back and relax after all of our days wrap up and chat for a bit before going off to do our own thing. I share a bathroom with my partner, the other three share one as well. We mostly did this because my boyfriend is particular about bathrooms and he knows I\u2019m not messy. But, I keep my T under our sink and do my shots when needed. \n\nOne of my roommates went looking for something in our bathroom and ran into the T. He sat me and my boyfriend down for a talk after texting us about something he found that concerned him, and honestly I figured this was gonna happen eventually. But he asked my boyfriend if he was juicing (my boyfriend works out regularly and is decently built), and when my boyfriend said no he asked me the same question. I was honest with him, telling him it was mine and that it was because I was trans. He was honestly taken aback by this and asked why I never told him, saying how it felt like it was something I should be telling the people I live with. \n\nI was once again blunt and told him I don\u2019t have to tell anyone who isn\u2019t my sexually partner and who isn\u2019t a doctor, because it\u2019s not their business. He seemed rather offended by this, and argued I should have told him so he didn\u2019t assume my boyfriend was taking a controlled substance as a steroid. In turn, I told him he shouldn\u2019t have been going through our things and should ask next time before doing so. This quickly ended the conversation, but he said I was being a \u201csmartass\u201d. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t told anyone else we live with to my knowledge, but my boyfriend is 100% on my side and is pretty pissed about him going through our stuff.

Sorry about you having to come out like that, OP. NTA", "NTA. You nailed it when you said you don't have to tell anyone who isn't your sexual partner or doctor. End of discussion tbh.", "NTA he shouldn't have snooped through your stuff and your medical history is absolutely none of his business.", "NTA.\n\nWhat\u2019s in your pants is no one\u2019s business.\n\nYour gender identity does not affect your character and therefore does not affect your ability to be a trustworthy person and good roommate.\n\nThose guys can kick rocks.", "As one trans dude to another, NTA. He's blaming you for him jumping to conclusions. Besides, did he ever ask? No?\n\nGlad he didn't screw up your stuff. The supplies are expensive nowadays.", "NTA. The only people who need to know are your sexual partners and your doctor.", "NTA \n\nYou were a little snippy, but tbh he deserved it", "NTA\n\nhe snooped. You\u2019re not obligated to come out to anyone. You got this, king", "NTA, you are right, it's none of his business, and he shouldn't have been going through your stuff.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t have been snooping around in your private bathroom and why is it any of his business who does T", "NTA", "You know, you probably have very little idea what he\u2019s got going on genitally and as a roommate he really should give you the full report.", "NTA.  It's none of your roommates' business and he's freaking out because you're transgender, not that you kept it a \"secret\".  Hopefully he'll realize that he screwed up in making such a fuss about it.  Sorry that he's making you feel bad.", "NTA it was none of his business and it\u2019s really not relevant for him to know. You are who you are and you are happy that\u2019s all he should care about.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone you don\u2019t want. \n\nAnd you are right - your roommate should not have been going through your things.", "NTA.  It's none of his business", "NTA, unless you are pursuing  someone romantically/sexually or dealing with medical stuff, being trans or gender in general doesn't matter.", "NTA. I don't see how it's any of their business tbh. His question to your bf about him juicing is also unnecessary and really none of his business either.", "Definitely NTA.\nEverything you said was right and it sounds like he probably knows that now and just has a hard time admitting he's wrong in the moment (getting defensive/calling names instead).", "NTA\n\nWhy do people think that they have a right to know what your genitals look like? So none of anyone's business ffs.", "NTA 100%; maybe there is an extremely rare case where it might be appropriate to tell someone else that you're trans but that is ALWAYS your decision, and this definitely wasn't one of those times; there was zero reason for you to tell any of the other housemates. And he shouldn't have been going through your stuff either.", "NTA WTF was he doing going through your stuff. That is the real question here. I think you and your BF should start looking for new roomates.", "NTA. Everyone else has covered why. \n\nTbh, even if your boyfriend was using steroids it would be none of his brother\u2019s or roommate\u2019s business anyway.", "NTA", "NTA none of this was any of his business, he shouldn\u2019t be going through your things and he doesn\u2019t need to know if you\u2019re trans", "NTA", "NTA. None of his business. Not his news to share either. He went into your space uninvited and is now questioning something that is private.", "NTA - he knows you're right and is trying to deflect by making you the bad guy.", "NTA. He called you a smartass because you shut him down and he realized he was being dumb but couldn\u2019t let go of his perceived right to know your personal information.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why people seem to feel like they have a right to know stuff like this. I have this problem with being gay sometimes - people will ask why I didn\u2019t tell them and I\u2019m like\u2026 why the hell would you feel like you just get to know?", "NTA\n\nThey have no need to know & should not have been snooping around in your space.\n\nBy the way,  I am a middle-aged cis woman using a low-dose testosterone replacement and your flatmate is lucky he's dealing with you and your partner rather than me. I have a somewhat....unfortunate reaction....to invasions of my privacy.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is none of his goddamn business, and he shouldn't be in your bathroom regardless! Idk in what universe you're the AH, your roommate definitely is, tho.", "NTA, from a European perspective.\n\nGenerally we have more the open approach to things, so roommate tell when they a gay, transgender etc.\n\nBut him searching through your stuff is unacceptable!\nI would honestly move out just because of that, it is a breach of trust which will never go away.", "No you\u2019re not the asshole. If you were a woman on hormone therapy for legit medical reasons would anyone BUT an asshole bring it up? Your medical condition requires hormones as well, and personally I\u2019ve found life works smoother if other people quit fixating on what\u2019s between the legs of people that aren\u2019t sexual partners.  Hormone therapies are line erectile dysfunction medication, or any medication that treats something going on between the legs. None of them are pleasant or comfortable to talk about and beyond acknowledging that they\u2019re not being misused for your boyfriend to roid up and that yes you have a medical need, the polite and decent thing to do is to gracefully bow out of that line of conversation.\n\nMy litmus test here is if you were cisgender and had a condition requiring that prescription would he even feel comfortable with anything more than \u201coh.

Neat\" like a normal person", "NTA, not their business and why are they going through your stuff?", "NTA\n\nAs a HH RN I advise all home meds and apparatus be stored in lockup to avoid accidental contamination not to mention better security.  You see why.\n\nIt might be wise to get out in front of this accidental outing by talking to the other roommates first, perhaps along with your SO for backup.  Longer you wait, others potentially control your narrative.  \n\nBrightest Blessings!", "NTA. No one's entitled to that information, you have every right to your own privacy.", "I feel like he is more offended you didnt trust him to reveal such a big factor in your life but i dont think you're an asshole but i also don't necessarily think he is an asshole either", "NTA but next time make sure your roommates are okay with trans people before moving in.

But I do feel like you should have been honest about it from the beginning. While I do support trans rights, I personally am not comfortable with the idea of sharing an apartment/house with them. It's my own personal preference and it does not, let me say it again for the people in the back, it does not mean that I have any hatred towards trans people. I am just not comfortable being around them. Perhaps the friend, while wrong for snooping, just doesn't feel comfortable living there now that he knows and doesn't know how to say it without being labeled a transphobe and a bunch of other harmful things.", "Going against the grain but YTA. There\u2019s a certain level of trust associated with living with someone. I\u2019d hate to find out someone was hiding something like this about themselves.
