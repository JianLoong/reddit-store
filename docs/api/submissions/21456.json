And as a proud follower of the jedi ways, you shouldn't hold onto your anger and hate, those lead to the dark side.", "Nice strawman, did you make it yourself?\n\nAnyways relationships are different than a living situation.", "True. I'll shake take your advice", "Then why I do I see so many roomate posts about \"looking for (male) or (female) roomates\"?\n\nDoesn't that make people sexist for wanting a specific gender?\n\nSee what I'm getting at?", "Same way it makes a difference when women want female roommates, and men want male roommates?\n\n\nYou can't tell me you don't see roomates posts looking for a certain type of person.", "See, the only one claiming or using hate is you. I'm saying that we should all support one another. Whose the bad guy here? I'm sorry, the bad person here? I want to be inclusive.", "There is, actually but you're not ready to hear it. Suffice to say that some people can be supportive of others while not being 100% okay with what they're doing or who they are. That's natural", "\"New concepts blow your mind\" I'm not the one balking at the idea that discriminating against someone is discriminatory but go off queen I guess.", "Those are fundamentally different things.\n\nI've got a bit of a nuanced opinion about that that I can't really capture the entirety of in a reddit comment thread, so I'm gonna summarize. \n\nSome people filter roommates by gender out of a desire for safety, some do it for preference, and *yes*, that can cross into discriminatory territory. There isn't a clean-cut, easy answer for that.\n\nBut trans people are actively withheld from living spaces by landlords and actively withheld from jobs, we're already an oppressed group when it comes to living and housing. \n\nYou do *not* see the same statistics based on gender alone. So that isn't an applicable counterargument.", "What legitimate reason do you have? I would love to hear it.\n\nIf you are not ok with \"who they are\" or \"what they're doing\" to themselves, that means you're transphobic.\n\nIt is not natural to be bigoted, that is something that you have learned and can unlearn."]}
