When the babies born if you don\u2019t show up then Sure you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want to have the baby in the first place and if this was roles reversed everyone would say \u201cyou\u2019re the woman it\u2019s your body\u201d. Sucks you don\u2019t wanna have the baby but consequences suck my dude.

You seem to have accepted that you bear shared responsibility for the child. You're also not the first man to cheat on a partner (kudos to Paul Hogan for the near quote there).\n\nIt's all well and good to say, \"I'll come, but there can't be any photos with me in them,\" but with the ubiquity of phone cameras, you'd be hard-pressed to enforce that and (again) your reasons for not wanting that are well-reasoned.\n\nYou're responsible for child support but not for creating a false narrative about an ongoing relationship or setting up for confusing \"documentation\" that could be used to manipulate the child later.\n\nNTA", "...in fucking Texas. \n\nThat's monstrously stupid.\n\nDefinite YTA.", "[removed]", "It was a really long winded way to say, \u201cmy girlfriend has no idea I got another girl pregnant, so I can\u2019t be tagged in posts because then she\u2019ll find out and dump me.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think is going to happen when you have to pay child support, OP? Your manager-at-a-Taco-Bell earnings aren\u2019t going to stretch too far. What happens when your girlfriend wants to get a place with you but you suddenly can\u2019t afford it? Or a wedding? \n\nAnyway, yeah. YTA. The baby and bills will be here soon. Best to actually man up and face the music.", "Right?\n\nI\u2019m a man. I\u2019m so responsible and driven!\n\nMommy!", "No for me what made me believe he was TA. \u2014I had a girlfriend when I met her and I still do, so I want to make sure to always be respectful of my relationship \u2014 seriously?\n\nIf you want to be respectful stop sticking your dick into random people, who are not your girlfriend.", "Haha \"I'm a responsible grown man, let me talk to my daddy\" hahahahahaah", "[removed]", "To make it worse: the baby could be affected by the STD too.", "Exactly she\u2019s having a baby with somebody who\u2019s already attempting to walk out of their child\u2019s life.

Just the contrast is funny, and highlights that he\u2019s a bit more immature than he\u2019s willing to let on.", "He should really stop \"bubbling\".", "They volunteered to raise one child already (and siblings if OP has them).

It's pretty common to refer to unplanned kids as accidents. \n\nUnfortunately for many of us, our parents didn't make us with some great desire in mind. Some of us were genuinely desired, some were mistakes, some were made with with a stupid plan in mind (\"save\" the relationship) and some were made out of malice", "Well, he clearly views it as a mistake, because he didn't want the woman to get pregnant. It's more the actions that are the mistake (having sex), which resulted in an outcome he didn't want (pregnancy).\n\nNot enough info to know if it was unprotected sex. You certainly can still get pregnant if the birth control fails.\n\nAll of which is irrelevant to his question; was he an AH for not going to the baby shower? I voted NTA.", "Every one I have been to has spent a fortune on food and entertainment to celebrate having the kid while mostly getting pillows and gift baskets (the most recent one I attended had me bringing wine), but that could be my own experience. \n\nEven so, I assume she will be the one raising the kid from his attitude, so what exactly would his role be there other than to be scowled at by the relatives of the Mom?", "I know, just spamming every comment with it lol", "I would really love to see him in court saying, \"but mommy and daddy said I'm not responsible for this child because I didn't know the mother very well when I got her pregnant\"", "I thought that was just awkward phrasing on his part.

It's not like the baby was spontaneously conceived. The 2 events are directly linked because 1 caused the other. \n\nBeing a mistake doesn't make you not human or lesser. It's just a fact, doesn't mean anything bad on your end. It doesn't reflect you as a person"]}
