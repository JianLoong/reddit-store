It\u2019s not about what\u2019s best for you anymore - which doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up all other ambitions in life and be miserable, but you do have to accept that there is now a whole other person, a tiny helpless person who understands none of this, whose safety and happiness is your job.  \n\nAnd you absolutely are in a relationship with your child\u2019s mother - you\u2019re co-parents.

I'd wager dollars-to-gorditas that you haven't and that's the reason for the concern about social media posts. You're still not respecting your relationship if you're hiding any of this. You're lying to avoid accountability. \n\nThis whole \"my mental health and safety\" is complete bullshit. Grow the fuck up. You're a dad now, you don't get to pull that card when it comes to your kid. Further, that's not a blank check to avoid doing things you don't want to do. That may have flown when you were in high school and mommy and daddy coddled you, but those days are over. Welcome to adulthood.  \n\nMoreover, it doesn't sound like they started calling you names until after you pulled this deadbeat action.
