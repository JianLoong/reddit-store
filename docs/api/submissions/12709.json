If you are playing with challenges then you do not need to give clues as to whether or not your word is a real word or not. You must decide without any additional clues whether or not you want to challenge or, if you just want to know the definition, just explicitly state that you will not challenge and you just want to know. \n\nIt\u2019s a dumb fight but you weren\u2019t being rude. I\u2019ve rarely won scrabble myself and I always ask what new words are so I can learn and I always say I won\u2019t challenge it if that\u2019s the case.", "NTA.\n\nI'm no Scrabble expert, but I think looking up the definition of a word played by another player is considered a challenge. \n\nIt sounds like you see the game differently. I would suggest agreeing to disagree, or decide which is more important - your principles / pride re this issue, or getting along with your wife / playing future games of Scrabble with her.", "Honestly YTA. It sounds like she literally was just curious about what the word meant and you were refusing to answer because you wanted so badly to make her lose a turn. Challenging a word implies that the person doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s a real word, which she never said.", "NTA. Your wife appears to be angry about losing.\n\nThere\u2019s a great game for providing Definitions; it\u2019s called \u201cBalderdash\u201d. You provide fake definitions for words; along with the real answer. Apparently your wife wanted to play that game instead. \n\nWiki says it\u2019s a good game for scrabble fans.", "NTA\n\nShe was freaking out that you were going to win.\n\nAnd she can't deal that you dethroned her.\n\nIt's very bad form to look up words before the turn ends and before the possible challenge is dismissed. She should have been penalized for that.", "This is such a stupid fight. Of course YTA. It\u2019s a game. Do you want to keep playing games? The game is not more important than having a pleasant time playing it. I don\u2019t even know you and I hate the way you play games too.", "NASPA member here that has played in actual competitive tournaments, NTA.\n\nKnowing the definitions is kinda typical for casual play, but in no way does it apply to a competitive game and it looks like since you were going by official challenge rules that the game plays more like a competitive game. With that said, a lot of good players don't know the definitions of the words they play. We just need to know they're words, and that's the only important part.\n\nTo answer your question, assuming you're playing under TWL rules, challenging a valid word does indeed result in a lost turn. If you're playing using the Collins dictionary (standard outside of USA, long story as to why), then challenging a valid word results in the person getting 5 points. Most of the time for the sake of the game itself, it results in a lost turn for somebody depending on if the word is legal or not.\n\nI really don't know why your wife agreed to challenge rules then went and looked up the word on her phone when deciding to challenge or not.  I get that it's a game for fun between you and your wife, but that shouldn't be allowed.\n\nWith all that stated, I'd also like to note that yes, people will not want to play scrabble with you. I mean that in the nicest way possible. No one in my family ever wants to play me and I very rarely get finished games in aside from other scrabble players who are more familiar with competitive scrabble.", "NTA\n\nAsking for a definition without challenging (or at least waiting until the time you\u2019re allowed to challenge has passed) is the same as asking for a consequence-free challenge. If you\u2019re just curious about the word, wait until you can no longer challenge or clarify that you won\u2019t challenge regardless of the answer before asking (or add it into your house rules that asking automatically forfeits your right to challenge that word). While that may not have been OP\u2019s wife\u2019s intention, it does look like she\u2019s fishing for information before risking a lost turn.", "A lot of people saying you don't sound \"fun\" to play with. These are people who can only enjoy games when the other players will let them cheat. And then what is even the point of playing? To shore up her ego? What's the point of a challenge even existing if you play HER way?\n\nNTA, she wanted it both ways, and you busted her. Being fun doesn't mean \"ignore the rules I don't like when it is convenient for me.\" She's the one who sucked the fun out of the game, not you.", "NTA, what is the point of playing a game if you let your opponent not follow the rules? To me it just wouldn't be fun, and if she gets that mad I think she's the one who doesn't know how to play. I don't know why people have decided that her not liking how 'you' play means that you are hypercompetitive when she's the one who threw a tantrum because you didn't favor her and won. I'd never play with someone like that at anything (unless we agree beforehand that we can ignore that rule - but there is no playing competitive games otherwise, come on, you are supposed to be relaxed while playing to win, no rules mean no game)", "NTA I think it was perfectly legitimate to ask if she was challenging or not. All she had to do was say no. This is how Scrabble works.", "NTA, sounds like she's a sore loser.", "NTA. I guess that maybe you were being a bit competitive, but you said you never win, and I can understand actually wanting to win for once. And she\u2019s the one that refused to answer your question of whether she was challenging. A simple yes or no would\u2019ve ended the interaction.", "NTA\nAs a scrabble player she knew better. Dhe was pulling a fast one and you called her out.", "NTA, she could've said, \"I believe it is a real word, I just dont know what it means.\" Asking questions out of curiousity during a game is fine, but I completely understand and support you in wanting to clarify this as it had a direct impact on the game. Especially after you had had a conversation about this specific rule. \nAhe sounds like a sore loser.", "I don't understand. If you ask for a definition of the word or - even worse - look it up yourself, you already know if the word exists or not. There would be no reason to challenge the word after it. The act of looking the word up is absolutely the same as challenging it.\n\nYour wife sounds like an awful person to play against. Seems like she's a sore loser. You could've given in to not make her mad. But I personally am not a fan of walking on eggshells just so assholes can keep on being assholes. NTA.", "I'm gonna go ESH.  \n\n\nYou suck because you're pissed that she keeps winning.  \n\n\nShe sucks because she tried to get around a rule.  \n\n\nWhich leads me to ask:  Why do you guys play this game?", "NTA. It was clearly a sneaky way to determine if she wanted to challenge it, without risking the loss of a turn. Especially with how vague she was being; if she truly cared only about the definition, could have said \"I'm not challenging it, just interested in the definition.\"", "She literally could have started by looking it up. Obviously that's allowed. She's trying to call your bluff, but you literally were not bluffing. \n\nNTA, but I think maybe y'all should stop playing scrabble together.", "NTA - She should have said she wasn't challenging when you asked.  Then you would have told her.  It just sounds like you and your wife are super competitive about scrabble, so it got heated.\n\nHowever I think you'll get a lot of Y T A in the comments because of the tone of your post.  I can't explain what exactly it is, things like bringing up how calm you were, how you were \"taken aback,\" putting \"rude\" in quotation marks, overexplaining the challenge rules.\n\nThere is no common courtesy in Scrabble.  It's a cold ruthless game.", "NTA, It sounds like a possible miscommunication but tbh It sounds like she was just trying to work around challenging the word out loud", "NYA - Homegirl was LIT UP that you dethroned the queen.", "NTA but you two have incompatible approaches to playing games lol", "YTA - you\u2019re playing a game with your wife.

She was just a sore loser", "Info: You seem to focus quite a bit on the fact that you lose often in this game and her reaction seems to indicate a potential pattern of over competitiveness on your part, so in order to judge this we would first need to know if this is truly a pattern for you. Also we would need to know how she acts when winning. If she holds it over you in any way or if she rubs it in your face.", "NTA", "NTA. Next time make up a fake definition that she will challenge and lose on. That's just common courtesy.", "NTA. Experienced scrabble player here, it\u2019s not necessary that you define the words that you put on the board. \n\nIt\u2019s totally appropriate for her to be curious about the word and look it up to learn what it means (either for general learning or so she can potentially use it in the future). but she needs to commit to whether or not this is a challenge before she looks it up. Under the rules you were playing, her options were either to (1) declare a challenge and then check the dictionary to see if she wins her challenge\u2026 And then take the penalty when she doesn\u2019t\u2026 OR (2) tell you \u201cthis isn\u2019t a challenge, I\u2019m just curious\u201d before looking it up. if the word is there, she learns a new word.  If the word isn\u2019t there, she learns that it isn\u2019t a word and that you have a strategy of faking words that she needs to adapt to. But she doesn\u2019t get to ask you to remove it because she passed on the challenge.\n\nI don\u2019t understand all of these people saying you are an AH. That makes no sense, all you were doing was following the standard rules of the game. I\u2019m thinking the people calling you that don\u2019t actually play Scrabble seriously. \n\nOtherwise they would recognize that she was wanting to have her cake and eat it too, so to speak. Retaining her right to challenge while she peruses the dictionary to figure out if she will win her challenge or not before declaring it.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to play the game where everyone has free access to the dictionary at all times, I just enjoy the game more that way and it becomes more about strategy than about who has the biggest vocabulary of memorized words. In a game following those rules then her behavior would be perfectly OK.
