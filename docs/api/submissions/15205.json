She wasn't ready to be a mom and she cheated on Kevin and pretty much abandoned him and Tanner  after she started having drug issues which took its toll on Kevin.  Though he started dating this boy Kalim 27M a year later and he stuck around and they got married in college.\n\nNow I know Kalim has been a great stepdad to Tanner and me and Kevin's mom like him alot ,but we do wish Tanner got to know his mom. She recently got back in touch a few months ago wanting to get to know Tanner after getting out of the Army. Kevin didn't like that to much but decided on supervised visits. Sometimes me and the wife babysit when the boys happen to work late. Kendra came by a few weeks ago just wanting to see Tanner and we let her. Since then  we let her take him for an hour so she could spend some time with him.\n\nKalim got off work earlier than he thought last week when we were babysitting and came to pick up Tanner early. Problem was He was out with Kendra and they hadn't gotten back yet. Kalim was upset when he found out  freaking out at us for letting Tanner go off with Kendra. I told him to calm  down cause we'd been letting them spend time together and nothing happened. He got even more upset and told us that's not what he and Kevin had agreed on with her and we were going behind their backs.  I promptly reminded him that he wasn't Tanner's biological parent and he had no right keeping him away from his mom like that. He got this sad look on his face and just went outside and sat in his car till Kebdra brought Tanner back and he took Tanner home.\n\nWe got an angry  call from Kevin  the next day about how  he couldn't believe I said that to Kalim after all he'd done for him and Tanner. That Kalim was way more of a real parent to Tanner than Kendra ever was.  He's still been mad at us since then.

Its about who sticks around.\n\nAlso i seriously question your judgement, grandmother or not. You are letting a young child go with a mum that abandoned him and had drug problems. Unsupervised. Away from the house. \n\nYep that sounds brilliant.\n\nRemember that you dont have any rights as a grandmother and Kevin could very easily refuse to leave you alone with the child as he cant trust you. You have stepped over the line with both the child and what you said to Kalim.", "YTA - stepdad may not the right (did he legally adopt him) but his bio dad did.\n\n*YOU* don\u2019t have the right to make those type of decisions. \n\nShe\u2019s been gone for years, just popped back up and wanted to see her child. She\u2019s a stranger. She\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have unsupervised visits with the child.\n\nThey are giving her a chance by allowing *supervised* visits. They\u2019re not cutting her off completely. How do they know what her drug issues are like?\n\nI would absolutely cut you off from babysitting since you can\u2019t be trusted to respect boundaries. Also, the fact that she must have known the rules about visitation and instead when to the grandparents to bend them, show exactly why she should have supervised visits.", "YTA. \n\nKendra has *just* returned to Tanner's life and is someone you all barely know at this point. At best, you're disrespecting Kevin and Kalim's wishes and at worst, you could've set Tanner up to be kidnapped. \n\nYou overstepped your bounds like crazy by making a parental decision that disrespected the choices that Kevin made for his son. \n\nAnd then to add insult to injury you made a knock at the man who has been helping raise your grandson. Being a bio parents doesn't make you a good one, as seen with Kendra. Kalim has stepped up for Tanner and is a part of his primary household. \n\nYou owe Kalim a very sincere apology in which you acknowledge his role in Tanner's life as a parent.", "Info: Who is the legal guardian of Tanner? Are you, or is Kevin? \n\nIf Kevin is the legal guardian, you have no right to let Tanner go off with another party without permission from Kevin.  \n\nYWBTA for releasing the child to a non-custodial parent without the express permission of the custodial parent.  If you were running a daycare, you would be shut down for this.", "YTA. It's not your decision. You aren't the parent.", "YTA. You made sure to throw out that Kalim wasn't the parent, well guess what? YOU'RE NOT EITHER. They had supervised visits for a reason and it isn't your place to make changes to that arrangement. I hope Kevin and Kalim see that allowing you to have unsupervised visits is dangerous and limit your time with him until you understand the concept of boundaries.", "YTA.  She may be Tanner's biological mother but she is not a Mom.  Kendra wasn't there during the tough times, the sleep deprived times, the tantrums, the scary times.  She doesn't get to waltz in and play at being Mom.  She needs to earn back your son's trust.\n\nBecause what if she just up and disappears again?  She's done it once so what's stopping her from doing it again?", "YTA.  This isn't your call to make and what you said to Kalim WAS a slap in the face.  It sounds like there is a visitation arrangement between Kevin and Kendra and it's your job to honor it. Don't be surprised if it's your access to Tanner--and not Kendra's--that is most affected by your poor behavior here.", "I find the entire premise of this post far fetched. I seriously doubt anyone would allow a parent with supervised visitation to take a child out with out the custodial parent's permission. Especially because the non custodial parent could just leave with the child to parts unknown.\n\nHowever, anyone who would encourage and permit a non custodial parent with supervised visitation to take a child without the custodial parent's knowledge and permission is YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou also aren't the biological parent of your grandson, AH", "YTA, obviously. You should have never let your grandson have one-on-one time with his bio mom without your son's permission. You should have never said such a mean comment to your son-in-law either.", "Wow, YTA absolutely. As Tanner's adoptive FATHER, Kalim *does* have the right to stop unsupervised and unscheduled visits with his biological mother. You have no right to make any of these decisions. \n\nHopefully they will keep Tanner from having unsupervised visits with you for awhile until they can trust you with him again.", "Dude, wtf?! You\u2019re way out of line here, stay in your lane. It\u2019s not up to you how Kendra gets to reconnect with her son, if at all. You broke any trust your son has in you and you insulted his husband that you admitted is a great dad. \n\nMajor YTA, can\u2019t believe you have the balls to even post this and have to ask.", "YTA. Not your kid, not your call. If I were your son, you would never spend time alone with my child again.", "YTA. Kevin *is* the biological parent *with* sole custody and *he* said supervised visits *only*. Karim might not be \"biological\" but he did more raising than the \"mother ever did and deserves respect. You fucked yourself right out of your grandchild's life.", "YTA...If I'm reading this correctly, you let your grandson's biological mother take him, while neglecting to tell his father?  What on earth gives you that right?  Kalim HAS been more of a parent. If your son tells you that, then that's the way it is.", "So your son agreed to supervised visits and you\u2019re letting your grandson go out with his biological mom unsupervised?\n\nYTA\n\nYou\u2019re also the asshole for being rude to Kalim.", "YTA\n\nPer your replies to other comments Kalim is Tanner's father, he adopted him. How dare you go behind this child's LEGAL parents' backs and give this legal stranger unvetted access to the child she abandoned.\n\nBiology means nothing here. Kalim legally has a right to parent this child how he and Kevin see fit. In fact  if he were to split up with Kevin, over Kevin's parents being AHs, the courts would order he have some form of custody/visitation. As Kendra is no longer legally Tanner's parent, she has no rights to custody or visitation.\n\nApologise and maybe get some therapy so you can do some self reflection and deal with having no access to your grandchild if it comes to that. They would not be AHs for barring you from having contact with Tanner after this.", "YTA. \n\nKalim might not be Tanner's biological parent, but guess what? NEITHER ARE YOU. You have completely overstepped a boundary multiple times. If you didn't want to discuss this with Kalim, fine - that's on you.  But there's no reason at all that you shouldn't have discussed this with Kevin BEFORE you decided to do whatever you felt like with HIS child. \n\nAnd just in case I didn't get my point across, YTA. You will continue to be TA until you apologize for your actions and stop thinking your grandparent \"rights\" mean more than the rights of the parents raising the child.", "YTA - It doesn't sound like you have any right to allow Kendra to take Tanner. His biological father expressed that he was only comfortable with supervised visits, so that's not your call. Kalim sounds like he's been a good guy to your son and grandson and even if it's true that he's not the biological father, you were out of line for saying what you said; even though he has no biological obligation, he's stepped up a lot more than his biological mom. that's huge. I would apologize to Kevin and Kalim for going against their wishes. I'd also suggest getting a formal custody agreement drawn up because you're putting your grandson in a lot of danger by letting him go with his biological mom if she should choose to take him.", "YTA- this is the parents choice NOT YOURS to decide who they see.  Good way to never get to see your grandson again. Overstepped BIG time.", "YTA you dont make decisions on your sons child", "Yup, YTA.  On multiple counts. (1) you had no right to modify the visitation arrangement.  No right at all.  (2) That guy is the step-parent, actively taking a role in raising him with your son.  No, he cannot dictate treatment of your grandson (unless the authority was granted by your son) but he certainly has a reason to chastise you for violating the arrangement.  You were way out of line and owe some serious apologies.  If it were me, you would not be left alone with the boy anymore given that you obviously are not willing to respect his father's stated wishes.", "Do I understand correctly that you (without consulting Kevin) decided to let Kendra take Tanner?\n\nIf so, YTA. You aren't the parent of this child. \n\nIf not, YTA. It's up to Kevin, ultimately how Kendra gets to interact with Tanner, but there is absolutely no reason to throw \"biological parent\" in anyone's face. \n\nKalim has *chosen* to be a parent to Tanner and that's far more than many \"biological\" parents ever offer to their children. Kendra included, by the sounds of it.", "YTA - I am appalled by your behavior.", "Info: sorry I am not sure I understand correctly. You gave Tanner to Kendra / let her see him without asking your son first?", "YTA  big time like if i have the ages right Kalim has been there for Kevin and Tamner since him and Kevin were 16 -17yrs old and stayed with him for all that time. Kalim has been a  second dad to a kid that wasn't his since he was round 16 and even adopted him.  That was such a slap in the face of someone who's been good to your son and grandson.\n\nPlus you Kendra has had drug issues and abandoned  Tanner  she's lucky to get supervised visits after just waltzing back into his life", "YTA\n\nI get your point of wanting Tanner to get to know his biological mother, but that's not your choice to make. I hope this situation is resolved in a mature manner, but don't be surprised if you get cut off from contact for a while. We all make choices in life, and they all have consequences.", "YTA. And what really concerns me is that Tanner hasn\u2019t told his fathers about these visits. So my question is, who\u2019s the asshole that is asking him to keep it a secret?", "YTA.  You broke their trust, its not your place to go behind the parents' backs and against their wishes while babysitting.  They have their way of handling the biological mother that you need to respect.\n\nBy all means, let them know what you think is best. But if you break trust like this, you break trust.", "Parenting is a verb op. Not based solely on biological basis. \n\nYTA", "YTA.  HUGE YTA.  This was NOT your decision to make!  This would be a hill to die on for me.  You crossed so far over a boundary it is unbelievable.  It doesn't matter whether YOU think the mom should be involved in the child's life and allowing the \"mom\" to take Tanner out of your house without his dad's permission is a horrible breach of trust.  I would NEVER let you watch that child again.  EVER.", "YTA You're telling me that this kid Kalim Literally chose to be a dad at something like 17 and you had the gall to say that to him?????? yta all the way \n\nAlso it's illegal to have unsupervised visit with the non custodial parent without permission from the custodial parent", "YTA.  I am so sad for your son and SIL. Your homophobia is showing. Were you hoping Kendra and your son would get back together? Or Tanner would want his parents to get back together? Like, be a \"normal\" family?\n\nYou are not Tanner's parent either. Kalim is Tanner's dad. Kendra is a stranger to Tanner. And a cheater, and drug addict. You know nothing about her except she's female. She needs to do the actual work to be able to even be in Tanner's life. \n\nYou broke their trust, and you will never get that back. Your babysitting days are over. And you taught Tanner to lie to his parents. That is disgusting.", "YTA. Parent\u2019s trump grandparents. And to be very clear I mean your son and his husband, they are the ones raising him and have full time custody.  Bio-mum  walked away and gave up her rights to be a parent. \n\nHope you are prepared to not see your grandkids until you earn the parents trust back.", "YTA.\nIt isn\u2019t up to you or your wife to decide who should or should not spend time with your grandson. \nKevin is his father and had clearly told you his boundaries and you blantantly ignored them \u201cbecause you felt Tanner should know his mother\u201d. So you let someone who is virtually a stranger to your grandson, someone your son obviously doesn\u2019t trust with his child, take said child out alone and unsupervised.\nKalim had good reasons to be angry with you and your words to him were unnecessary.", "YTA  Kendra cheated on your son, developed a drug problem and abandoned her child. I don't care if she's in the army or not - why on earth would you let someone that flakey take off with your grandchild? Your son made the decision for supervised visits based on her past behavior and not only did you disregard this, you got your grandson to lie for you? And then you insulted his wonderfully reliable step parent when you got caught?Please tell me where in all of this you're not asshole becauseI honestly can't find it.", "YTA. Major YTA. You will be lucky if you even get supervised visits with Tanner again. You crossed a major line and then became disrespectful when you were called out. You had absolutely no right to allow unsupervised visitation and Kalim had every right to call you out on it. Your behavior is disgusting and you need to do some serious self reflecting on why you felt you had the right to do any of this.", "YTA What part of supervised visit don\u2019t you understand? Kalim is, by your own admission, a great dad. You threw the fact that he\u2019s not the bio-dad in Kalim\u2019s face because you knew you had done the wrong thing and didn\u2019t want to accept responsibility. You are wrong on every front and owe everyone an apology. Shame on you.", "YTA. According to your comments Kalim has adopted Tanner, making him Tanner's legal guardian. Also, Kevin (the biological parent, since that seems important to you) is not on board with Tanner going on these visits. You went against the wishes of both parents.\n\nIf Tanner was my son, you wouldn't be seeing him anymore, at least not unsupervised.", "YTA that woman isn't a mom, she's barely an egg donor. Your son's HUSBAND and your grandson's ADOPTED FATHER is more of a parent then she is.", "YTA, that was not your call at ALL. How dare you??", "Dude, wtf is wrong with you. You wrote all this out and don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole? An absentee parent shows back up and you just let them take your grandson?! YTA", "YTA\n\nGuess who else is not the biological parent? YOU, OP!!!\n\nHow dare you go against your son and allow the mother unsupervised visits. You're a hypocrite and a half!", "WTAF is wrong with you????

A parent is the person that steps up!!!!  biological or not!!", "YTA Kendra had drug issues and appears to have decided that drugs were more important than her child. It's sad but it happens.\n\nShe's gotten her life in order. That's awesome. Your son has agreed to supervised visits- which is totally reasonable.\n\nYou don't have the rights- or the power- decide that Kendra should have unsupervised visits. Honestly, before letting her have supervised visits with Tanner at your house you should have been speaking with your son and SIL.\n\nBut you didn't because you KNEW better than Tanner's fathers.\n\nand you would have been totally time if your parents or in-laws had done something similar when Kevin was a kid? please.\n\nmaybe you'll be allowed supervised visits with Tanner again someday. but not someday soon, I imagine. but I'd start apologizing...hard. (but make sure you actually understand ALL of the reasons you are in the wrong.)", "MAJOR YTA\n\nYou DID go behind the child's parents' back.  Biology does NOT make a parent!\n\nYour son should definitely stop relying on you and find another babysitter so you have zero further contact with him.\n\nThis was a blatant disregard to your son's wishes and disrespectful to both his parents (being an egg donor does NOT make her a parent).  She was supposed to be earning trust back, you have also probably damaged your grandchild's and her potential of any future relationship, because she has also proven to be untrustworthy, but not as untrustworthy as you.\n\nYou do not deserve to be back in their lives.  SHAME on you!", "Fuck around and find out Op. hope they limit your contact with tanner. YTA", "YTA, what is this horrible grandparent day on here today? Some new troll? \n\nIf I were them I wouldn\u2019t let you see Tanner alone anymore. You only get supervised visits too since you\u2019re just as untrustworthy as the mother that abandoned him for years.", "YTA the f*ck is wrong with you? You're NOT the kid's parent, you don't get to overwrite their decisions about visitation and you don't get to tell the man who has been  more of a parent to that kid than that woman. F*cking childish bullsh*t. Be glad if they let you see that child at after this sh*t", "YTA. You have no right to go against your grandson\u2019s legal guardian\u2019s wishes. Your son agreed to supervised visits. You decided you knew better. I\u2019m guessing you will also be reduced to supervised visits going forward.", "YTA. Do you really not see how awful you are?!", "What a major AH. You are just the worst kind of person. This is your grandchild. You do not get to make those decisions. Parents make those decisions. You have an outside view of what happened between Kevin and Kendra but you acknowledge she 1. Cheated, 2. Had an addiction, 3. Was recently out of the military. Was she deployed? There is a relationship between military service and ptsd. Did you ask about this?\n\nYour son made a decision that she could see her son supervised and you decided to facilitate that without permission. Then let her take him. As a parent I would NEVER let you near my children again. You chose some woman who hurt your son OVER your son and potentially endangered your grandson. In what world are you living that you need to ask. YTA", "This is severely fucked up, you let what is basically a stranger  to this child that has a history of drug abuse take your grandchild without the permission of either parent. I think they would be smart not to leave their child with you again given your clear disregard for this child's saftey and thr opinions of your son. YTA and big time, you have some trust to rebuild with your son.", "YTA! You let your grandchild go with a stranger. Yes, she is his bio mother but a STRANGER nonetheless. Wtf is wrong with your judgement? She could have kidnapped him or worse! And until some kind of agreement occurs between Kevin and Kendra, he can keep her from seeing Tanner. He is the custodial parent, and he makes those decisions, NOT YOU. You cannot be trusted with the child\u2019s safety and welfare, and Kevin should never let you watch his child again.", "YTA\n\nSo supervised visitation especially if set by the court means that the child cannot be with that person unsupervised no matter who is supervising the visit. You could get into serious legal trouble if you go against the custody order simply because it\u2019s a legally binding agreement. Also since your SIL has adopted your grandson he is legally his father so saying that to him holds no merit and also it\u2019s extremely hurtful especially because you know he loves his son even if he\u2019s not biologically his.", "YTA congratulations you\u2019re not having alone time with your grandson again any time soon", "YTA.  Your not his parent so you have no right to determine who can be around the child.  You went against his father's decision.  When they go NC with you I hope you realize it is your fault.

You handed your grandchild over to the mother that abused drugs and left? How do you know that she is clean and sober? It was never your right to make the decision to allow her any unsupervised access to Tanner. That decision should have been made by Kevin.

Then you dismiss the only other parent your grandchild has ever known saying his opinion basically doesn't count. Yes it does he is the one who has raised this boy for years not the deadbeat who walked away. \n\nYou are grandparents not parents.

It doesn\u2019t actually matter that you want her and her son to have a relationship, Kevin and Kalim make that decision together, because they have a better knowledge of Tanner. \n\nSecond, Kalim\u2019s a stepfather recognized legally and has more rights to the decision then you do as grandparents.\n\nYou overstepped and prioritized your opinions over Tanner\u2019s safety until you recognize that your son will stay mad at you and he\u2019s not wrong.", "YTA for so many reasons here.\n\nFirst of all, as grandparents, you NEVER go behind the parents' backs. For any reason whatsoever. Your sons actually have the right to forbid you from seeing your grandson because of that. Second of all, Kalim is more of a parent to Tanner than Kendra is right now because she abandoned him and your son. That \"blood is thicker than water\" spiel doesn't apply when one of the parents abandons her kid. She's essentially a stranger to Tanner because she wasn't there for the first 11 years of his life. You should've talked to your son and son-in-law about this, and now you owe them a massive apology.", "Wow. Wow wow wow.\n\nYou'll be lucky to ever babysit, let alone be in the same zip code as Tanner from now on.  \n\nIf I were in Kevin's position, you would at the very least not be allowed to be around him unsupervised ever again.\n\nYou owe a massive apology to Kevin \n\nYou owe a gargantuan, astronomical apology to Kalim.

YOU'RE IN THE WRONG.", "Well, say goodbye to your grandkid, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be able to see him too often anymore. YTA, she has no rights to the child and abandoned the child by your own words. Even worse, she abandoned the child and the child\u2019s father for drugs. Even if she is an ex drug user, and has reformed her self completely in the military. That doesn\u2019t erase the fact that she abandoned them. That means she wasn\u2019t a mom anymore. She is an incubator that has regrets.\n\n Your son and his partner have every right to feel betrayed. All you needed to do was probably call them and discuss the matter.

You don't have the right to do that.", "NTA, if Kevin wants tanner to meet Kendra that's all that matters.", "No, you're not the asshole the kid needs to know his mom especially if she got a second chance at life. The kid will grow up blaming his dad for not letting him have a relationship and if Kevin tries to take Tanner away from his mom Tanner wouldn't like that im sure he has a bond with his mama already.

I have to change my answer to YTA. \nLeaving my original post here though:\n\n\n\nSoft ESH.\n\nBut since you're the one asking, let's focus on that.\n\nYou and your partner are encouraging a relationship between Tanner and Kendra, which is kind. I respect that you want to move forward with her in Tanner's life. \n\nEven though Khalid doesn't have paperwork saying he's a parent, he is playing the role every day. He clearly cares about Tanner and may even be willing to make it legal if it was an option. His life choices and actions merit better treatment than your scolding. \n\nIt sounds like you all are most concerned about doing what's best for Tanner. What a good starting point!

She wasn't ready to be a mom and she cheated on Kevin and pretty much abandoned him and Tanner  after she started having drug issues which took its toll on Kevin.  Though he started dating this boy Kalim 27M a year later and he stuck around and they got married in college.\n\nNow I know Kalim has been a great stepdad to Tanner and me and Kevin's mom like him alot ,but we do wish Tanner got to know his mom. She recently got back in touch a few months ago wanting to get to know Tanner after getting out of the Army. Kevin didn't like that to much but decided on supervised visits. Sometimes me and the wife babysit when the boys happen to work late. Kendra came by a few weeks ago just wanting to see Tanner and we let her. Since then  we let her take him for an hour so she could spend some time with him.\n\nKalim got off work earlier than he thought last week when we were babysitting and came to pick up Tanner early. Problem was He was out with Kendra and they hadn't gotten back yet. Kalim was upset when he found out  freaking out at us for letting Tanner go off with Kendra. I told him to calm  down cause we'd been letting them spend time together and nothing happened. He got even more upset and told us that's not what he and Kevin had agreed on with her and we were going behind their backs.  I promptly reminded him that he wasn't Tanner's biological parent and he had no right keeping him away from his mom like that. He got this sad look on his face and just went outside and sat in his car till Kebdra brought Tanner back and he took Tanner home.\n\nWe got an angry  call from Kevin  the next day about how  he couldn't believe I said that to Kalim after all he'd done for him and Tanner. That Kalim was way more of a real parent to Tanner than Kendra ever was.  He's still been mad at us since then. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He did not say you could hand Tanner over to Kendra so she can take him who knows where. But you arrogantly decided to ignore what your son wanted in regards to *his* child. \n\nKalim, who by your own admission is a great stepdad, was rightfully upset with your gross irresponsibility. Instead of realizing you fucked up, you insulted him. Why? Because you care more about Kendra being the bio mom than anything else.

The worse thing a step parent can be told is they are not the real parent and do not get the rights of a real parent. Well let me tell you right now some step parents - ones who by your own words are great - those are the ones that are real parents. They do get a say because they love a child they did not make and ask for nothing in return.  Again this was a decision your son made - you know the bio parent who stuck around????

Kalim would know better than you.

You broke their trust and put their child at risk. You decided she could be trusted based on the culmination of a few hours of her being on her best behaviour and gave her THEIR child.

You acted without any regard for the de facto parents.", "YTA,\n\n this woman is going to steal Tanner one day and y'all are fully going to be responsible. This is exactly how kidnapping happens, the immature parent worms their way in through family members/friends convincing them it's a good idea to ignore what the custodial parent wants and just runs off with the child. And you know she is an immature parent because she is knowingly going behind Kevin's, the custodial parent, back, and knowingly betraying their agreement. If she actually wanted to be a mother again to Tanner she would be going through the courts 50/50 or whatever she wanted. \n\nI strongly hope this teaches Kevin to never trust his son with y'all alone ever again. It's not your place to decide what is good for Tanner and what isn't, that is his dad's job and you have zero say in how Tanner's stepfather reacts to y'all betraying your son's and his trust.
