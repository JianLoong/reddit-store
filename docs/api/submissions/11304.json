I\u2019m not quite sure if I\u2019m TA here but I\u2019m thinking I may be. I (21F) am currently working at a small retail store. In the middle of January, my manager (35F) took on a volunteer, Frank (46M) who has to work as part of a program to help him with navigating the workforce with his disabilities. According to my manager, he is autistic and needs a higher amount of support than some other autistic people, such as myself. Frank\u2019s mother drives him to and from the store and he volunteers for 1-1.5 hours a day, 2-4 days a week. We rarely interact as he is always out front and I\u2019m always in the back.\n\nLast week he finished his program and my boss hired him Monday. The issue occurred the same day, with his mother being unable to come get him. She wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to the store until around 30 minutes or so after we closed. Frank\u2019s younger brother was home, but without a car, and their house wasn\u2019t close enough for someone to walk with Frank and then back to the store. My manager had Frank sit in the office until closing, and I assumed that other arrangements had been made, but after we clocked out she asked who would be willing to drive Frank home. My coworkers suddenly kicked off a game of \u201cnot it\u201d and I was left standing there confused with everyone looking at me. I\u2019m never quick enough to pick up on when/if we\u2019re doing \u201cnot it\u201d (though I didn\u2019t find this to be an appropriate situation for that anyway). \n\nI managed a lie on the spot, saying I had prior obligations and that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to drive in the opposite direction to take Frank home. I was honestly just not comfortable with being held responsible for getting someone else home and not comfortable with having someone who is practically a stranger in my car. I have trouble looking after myself and am not at all equipped to look after others whose needs are higher than my own. I ended up telling a trusted coworker the truth Tuesday, and apparently he told my manager, who sat me down yesterday morning and said she was very disappointed in me for not wanting to help Frank and that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about here.\u201d She says she expects me to step up next time there\u2019s an issue and that there could be consequences if she catches me in a lie like this again. I tried to explain to her why I wasn\u2019t comfortable taking him home, but she told me that it\u2019s no excuse for, in her words, \u201cabandoning and discriminating against a coworker in need.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m TA but I feel upset.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if this is important but in addition to being autistic I am also the youngest person on staff.

I've worked for a small business and a large and would always choose a large one over a family run one to work for.", "Also, even in cases where that's true, \"childlike innocence\" can mean \"doesn't understand boundaries like a neurotypical adult would\". Someone with a childlike mentality and adult body can do serious harm as well.", "Sadly as far as women are concerned all men they don\u2019t know have to be considered a risk.", "Yes, but this isn't a child she is asking you to look after. This is a mature man she is disrespecting as well as yourself. She's the manager - she gets paid the \"big bucks\" and part of that is looking after her staff not potentially putting them into danger to save herself inconvenience.", "Oof, I know that feel. Being really good at functioning doesn\u2019t negate the autism, can confirm.", "Can I go yell at your coworkers about boundaries and how autism is a SPECTRUM plz", "Emotionally manipulating a 21 yo AUTISTIC woman, as per her edit. She's also got a disability. My brother's bosses pull shit all the time because he's Autistic. Makes me SO mad.", "Yep that and the \u201cvolunteer\u201d part. Wtf is that? They had this guy there being trained without pay? I\u2019ve heard of programs where they pay part of a salary for someone so the business can take the risk at hiring someone with health issues and/or no experience. But the person is always paid somehow. No one should be volunteering to work for a business. \n\nThat job sounds sketchy as hell.", "Absolutely no way on the safety issue. Sure, most people are fine but this is a stranger significant older and likely stronger than her. And if something happened to her, guarantee the manager would not want to take any responsibility or blame.\n\nBeyond that, what if the coworker was injured in a car accident while she was driving and sued OP?", "\"No, that's not what we're about here.\"", "And you'll write all these terms out on a piece of paper and we'll sign it in front of the whole staff and then scan and email it to me from your work email, right? \n\nRight? \n\nRight?", "I read in a book once that innocence can be cruel... children rip wings off butterflies because they are curious, burn ants etc and think nothing of it. \nBeing childlike is like any other stage in human development.  Occasionally dangerous.", "She doesn\u2019t really get paid that much. Our job starts you out barely above federal minimum wage and in the decade she\u2019s been here she\u2019s only risen to $13.50/hr. She does make more than me though.", "The company my store is a part of takes volunteers as park of programs and their mission statement. We only take volunteers for legal reasons though, such as disabled training programs and court ordered community service.", "Think Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc", "The odd thing is, it kind of sounds like accommodations would be useful to you, but only because of the shitty way things are done at your job (e.g. the constant playing of \"not it,\" which would never be done in a reasonable workplace).", "I expected that which is why in inverted commas. But it is her job to manage staff and any requirements not order you to work outside of your hours and your own cost to fulfil them.", "They only take volunteers so they can exploit their labor just like your manager tried to exploit you into driving him home.", "The community service not getting paid makes sense. \n\nBut any of the programs I\u2019ve heard of for disabled people - they get paid. It may not be the full amount, and it maybe the program vs the employer paying it. But it seems very odd to take disadvantaged people and then make them work for free. It\u2019s not a good look for a company in my opinion, they are exploiting people. I\u2019d be very cautious and keep your guard up when dealing with a place like that, they don\u2019t sound to be too ethical. \n\nAdd in the weird game of \u201cnot it\u201d and your bosses reaction to try and task you with driving someone home who\u2019s the opposite sex and twice your age and apparently isn\u2019t capable of getting home alone safely alone are all bad signs. \n\nI\u2019d keep my head down, eyes open and mouth shut while I was there and look for work elsewhere in the meantime if I was in your shoes. \n\n100% NTA, that place sounds very inappropriate and possibly dangerous.", "OP, you need to report your manager to the corporate office. It is inappropriate to expect labor from an employee off the clock. It is also VERY UNSAFE to expect the youngest employee to drive home a stranger twice their age. The manager is fully responsible for that \"volunteer\" and it wouldn't surprise me to find out they violated a contract of some type.  \n\n\nThat manager is a company hazard and needs to get her shit together.", "Is it goodwill? Sounds like goodwill. We had a CEO who resigned after his yearly bonus was announced in the millions while 90% of the staff was making federal minimum wage. Managers made 25\u00a2 more an hour. Such a lovely company to be exploited for.\n\nBut to the issue at hand... If you're off the clock, she has 0 say about what you do. If she has an employee with no ride home and special needs, she needs to take him home. Not put it off on an underpaid, off the clock, employee.\n\nNTA.\n\nSee if you can get her to admit what she said about holding this against you in writing in case there is a future incident so that you can escalate to HR.", "I won\u2019t name the company. But I won\u2019t tell you that you\u2019re far off either.", "I understand.  I've been looking for work and I'm pregnant.  Nobody will straight up say they won't hire me but.... I'm not going to get hired until the baby is born. My partners family thinks I'm lying, that anyone would hire a 7 months pregnant woman lol", "Must be the rival.. Salvation Army.\n\nBut for real, don't let her bully you into ever doing anything off the clock. She has extremely limited power, even as a manager. And places like this need serious cause and multiple write ups to fire people, since otherwise they lose tax breaks."]}
