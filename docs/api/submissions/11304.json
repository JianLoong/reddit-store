I\u2019m not quite sure if I\u2019m TA here but I\u2019m thinking I may be. I (21F) am currently working at a small retail store. In the middle of January, my manager (35F) took on a volunteer, Frank (46M) who has to work as part of a program to help him with navigating the workforce with his disabilities. According to my manager, he is autistic and needs a higher amount of support than some other autistic people, such as myself. Frank\u2019s mother drives him to and from the store and he volunteers for 1-1.5 hours a day, 2-4 days a week. We rarely interact as he is always out front and I\u2019m always in the back.\n\nLast week he finished his program and my boss hired him Monday. The issue occurred the same day, with his mother being unable to come get him. She wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to the store until around 30 minutes or so after we closed. Frank\u2019s younger brother was home, but without a car, and their house wasn\u2019t close enough for someone to walk with Frank and then back to the store. My manager had Frank sit in the office until closing, and I assumed that other arrangements had been made, but after we clocked out she asked who would be willing to drive Frank home. My coworkers suddenly kicked off a game of \u201cnot it\u201d and I was left standing there confused with everyone looking at me. I\u2019m never quick enough to pick up on when/if we\u2019re doing \u201cnot it\u201d (though I didn\u2019t find this to be an appropriate situation for that anyway). \n\nI managed a lie on the spot, saying I had prior obligations and that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to drive in the opposite direction to take Frank home. I was honestly just not comfortable with being held responsible for getting someone else home and not comfortable with having someone who is practically a stranger in my car. I have trouble looking after myself and am not at all equipped to look after others whose needs are higher than my own. I ended up telling a trusted coworker the truth Tuesday, and apparently he told my manager, who sat me down yesterday morning and said she was very disappointed in me for not wanting to help Frank and that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about here.\u201d She says she expects me to step up next time there\u2019s an issue and that there could be consequences if she catches me in a lie like this again. I tried to explain to her why I wasn\u2019t comfortable taking him home, but she told me that it\u2019s no excuse for, in her words, \u201cabandoning and discriminating against a coworker in need.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m TA but I feel upset.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if this is important but in addition to being autistic I am also the youngest person on staff.

You will get found out if you\u2019re lying. Why not just say no? It\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, you are not in any way obligated to be put out like this.\n\nAlso, and more worryingly, you, as an 18 Yr old woman are completely right te be unwilling to be alone with a man that age who you do not know and trust..", "Why can't your manager take Frank home? Why do they expect an employee to do something above their paygrade without even consulting them first?\n\nNTA", "NTA you are not obligated to do anything that makes you uncomfortable and especially not be responsible for anyone else.   Bosses have no say on what you do with your personal time.", "Tell them to read about Patch Adams.  It\u2019s fucking ludicrous to expect someone not trained to deal with mentally challenged people to take care of them. \n\nIt\u2019s a half hour. Your manager should have stayed and waited the half hour with franky. Your manager is a dick", "\u2026 you need to call the HR. Is ur manager gonna pay you extra for off clock work? Its not your obligation to look after another guy.", "NTA\n\nYou do not need to put yourself in the position of having Frank or anyone else in your car.  If you are not comfortable having someone else in your car, just say your anxiety get to be too much with other people in your car.  \n\nIn an hourly job, such as a retail one, you only are obligated to work when on the clock.  Being asked by management to transport This new colleague who is practically a stranger is a HUGE imposition.  \n\nMy guess is that your age and gender work against you there anyway.", "Regardless of disabilities, no 21 year old woman should be pressured into giving a 46 year old man a ride anywhere if she doesn't feel comfortable doing so.  Your manager is completely in the wrong here.  NTA.", "So, all the other workers are NTA because they didn't lose the \"not it\" game (including the co-worker who ratted out OP)?  I don't think so.\n\nAs someone else said, OP should chase that all the way up the HR chain.\n\nAnd yeah, NTA.", "As the mother of a 23 year old autistic woman, I would be horrified to find out that a. My daughter\u2019s boss wanted her to drive a strange man home, especially since I KNOW she would be uncomfortable and b. Later berated her for not doing it. I know you\u2019re probably adapted and comfortable there, honey, but this is not ok. Maybe ask a friend or relative for help looking for another job where they treat you better.", "Nope. NTA. You cannot legally be told what to do off the clock. So, they can\u2019t tell you to drive him home. Next time don\u2019t make up any excuses. Just say no. \n\nNo is a complete sentence. No. No; I am not doing that. \n\nOp, I have epilepsy. At present I cannot drive. I have a medical suspension on my driver\u2019s license. (It sucks.) while it would be nice for a co-worker of mine to drive me to pick up lunch from a restaurant on lunch or drop me off at the gas station near home, etc it is NOT their responsibility to do so. My EMPLOYER has to make reasonable accommodations, such as allowing me off when I have to undergo neurological testing. None of that is ever on my co-workers, and I work in healthcare.", "NTA. This is weird and dangerous. Give your no in writing.", "You're not the asshole.  All these people are trying to take advantage of your youth, and I include Frank's mother in this.  As soon as you do it one time, they'll expect you to do it all the time.  You have NO obligation to do this.  Let your manager drive the employee home.", "It's also a liability problem. This is why we are discouraged from giving clients rides--if there's an accident and it's \"for work\", it could be a problem for the company. Perhaps the manager should be reminded of this.", "NTA, OP is just barely an adult. She didn\u2018t want to be alone with a grown man she didn\u2018t know well. That\u2018s a perfectly reasonable excuse wether he has a disability or not.", "actually its entirely legal in most states to pay disabled workers less, even below the normal minimum wage. as far as i can find as of now only 3 states have outlawed it entirely, maybe up to 5 because i saw some earlier sources claiming 2 other states that i didnt see mentioned on more recent sources. i believe the current subminimum wage (minimum for disabled basically) is like 4.25? it was getting a bit of publicity mid 2022 but from what i read it didnt change much, its not commonly talked about. a business basically just has to claim they do less than normal employees and its legal. i think theres also a permit they need to get for it? and while it technically is illegal to not hire someone because of a disability that doesn't stop businesses and unless you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that thats why you werent hired they very likely won't get punished for it", "I'm a 6'3\", autistic ,28yo man, and I wouldn't have been comfortable in that situation either, OP.  You are NTA.  You and your comfort and safety take presedence.", "NTA. For one, you have zero responsibility to any co-worker outside of work hours, ever. It's not in your job description. For another thing, autistic or not, this is a 46 year old man and you are a 21 year old woman. Reddit can harp on about \"if the roles were reversed\" or whatever as much as they damn well please, but having an older man who is basically a complete stranger alone with you in an enclosed vehicle? Fuck no. Absolutely not - especially since you've mentioned you feel like you can barely take care of yourself. Also, if your manager really gave a shit about getting your co-worker home, she would have done it herself. Same for the rest of your coworkers.", "Agreed, but in addition, if it\u2019s and expectation of you and your job, then it your employers job to pay you for that time and for mileage and wear and tear on your car.", "Both manager & so called friend she confined in are A H though.", "OP should be able to refuse simply on the basis of her being a 21 year old woman and him being a 46 year old man. Autistic or not, safety comes first. And if he did do something to OP, what would they do? Because I wouldn't put it past them to blame it on his autism and \"he doesn't know better\" and completely dismiss it.", "He\u2019s not a child, he\u2019s her employee who SHE is responsible for.", "Or the manager could have waited behind thirty minutes for his ride to get there", "Not all men are predators but nearly all predators are men. OP shouldn\u2019t have to risk her safety for your ideology. This perspective is naive at best. Please show a fraction of the empathy that you show men you feel are judged unfairly to women who are actual victims or are being asked to compromise their safety.", "Or in my opinion you should both go to corporate AND find another job."]}
