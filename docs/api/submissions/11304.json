I\u2019m not quite sure if I\u2019m TA here but I\u2019m thinking I may be. I (21F) am currently working at a small retail store. In the middle of January, my manager (35F) took on a volunteer, Frank (46M) who has to work as part of a program to help him with navigating the workforce with his disabilities. According to my manager, he is autistic and needs a higher amount of support than some other autistic people, such as myself. Frank\u2019s mother drives him to and from the store and he volunteers for 1-1.5 hours a day, 2-4 days a week. We rarely interact as he is always out front and I\u2019m always in the back.\n\nLast week he finished his program and my boss hired him Monday. The issue occurred the same day, with his mother being unable to come get him. She wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to the store until around 30 minutes or so after we closed. Frank\u2019s younger brother was home, but without a car, and their house wasn\u2019t close enough for someone to walk with Frank and then back to the store. My manager had Frank sit in the office until closing, and I assumed that other arrangements had been made, but after we clocked out she asked who would be willing to drive Frank home. My coworkers suddenly kicked off a game of \u201cnot it\u201d and I was left standing there confused with everyone looking at me. I\u2019m never quick enough to pick up on when/if we\u2019re doing \u201cnot it\u201d (though I didn\u2019t find this to be an appropriate situation for that anyway). \n\nI managed a lie on the spot, saying I had prior obligations and that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to drive in the opposite direction to take Frank home. I was honestly just not comfortable with being held responsible for getting someone else home and not comfortable with having someone who is practically a stranger in my car. I have trouble looking after myself and am not at all equipped to look after others whose needs are higher than my own. I ended up telling a trusted coworker the truth Tuesday, and apparently he told my manager, who sat me down yesterday morning and said she was very disappointed in me for not wanting to help Frank and that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about here.\u201d She says she expects me to step up next time there\u2019s an issue and that there could be consequences if she catches me in a lie like this again. I tried to explain to her why I wasn\u2019t comfortable taking him home, but she told me that it\u2019s no excuse for, in her words, \u201cabandoning and discriminating against a coworker in need.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m TA but I feel upset.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if this is important but in addition to being autistic I am also the youngest person on staff.
