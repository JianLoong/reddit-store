I\u2019m not quite sure if I\u2019m TA here but I\u2019m thinking I may be. I (21F) am currently working at a small retail store. In the middle of January, my manager (35F) took on a volunteer, Frank (46M) who has to work as part of a program to help him with navigating the workforce with his disabilities. According to my manager, he is autistic and needs a higher amount of support than some other autistic people, such as myself. Frank\u2019s mother drives him to and from the store and he volunteers for 1-1.5 hours a day, 2-4 days a week. We rarely interact as he is always out front and I\u2019m always in the back.\n\nLast week he finished his program and my boss hired him Monday. The issue occurred the same day, with his mother being unable to come get him. She wouldn\u2019t be able to come back to the store until around 30 minutes or so after we closed. Frank\u2019s younger brother was home, but without a car, and their house wasn\u2019t close enough for someone to walk with Frank and then back to the store. My manager had Frank sit in the office until closing, and I assumed that other arrangements had been made, but after we clocked out she asked who would be willing to drive Frank home. My coworkers suddenly kicked off a game of \u201cnot it\u201d and I was left standing there confused with everyone looking at me. I\u2019m never quick enough to pick up on when/if we\u2019re doing \u201cnot it\u201d (though I didn\u2019t find this to be an appropriate situation for that anyway). \n\nI managed a lie on the spot, saying I had prior obligations and that I wouldn\u2019t have enough time to drive in the opposite direction to take Frank home. I was honestly just not comfortable with being held responsible for getting someone else home and not comfortable with having someone who is practically a stranger in my car. I have trouble looking after myself and am not at all equipped to look after others whose needs are higher than my own. I ended up telling a trusted coworker the truth Tuesday, and apparently he told my manager, who sat me down yesterday morning and said she was very disappointed in me for not wanting to help Frank and that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about here.\u201d She says she expects me to step up next time there\u2019s an issue and that there could be consequences if she catches me in a lie like this again. I tried to explain to her why I wasn\u2019t comfortable taking him home, but she told me that it\u2019s no excuse for, in her words, \u201cabandoning and discriminating against a coworker in need.\u201d I genuinely don\u2019t know if I\u2019m TA but I feel upset.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if this is important but in addition to being autistic I am also the youngest person on staff.

Definitely stand up for yourself.", ">They may also think I\u2019d be more sympathetic and agree easier since I\u2019m also autistic.\n\nYeah, this is manipulation right here and they may be trying to take advantage of this so that they don't have to interact with him more than they have to.  And then your boss hits you with a guilt trip over it to seal the deal.  \n\nWhy don't they get to feel guilty over not wanting to associate with Frank but you do?  You shouldn't.  You're not someone else's caretaker.  You're your own.", "We're prone to emotional manipulation and people absolutely will take advantage of our nature. I honestly don't believe that your boss would have had this inappropriate conversation with you if she didn't know that you're autistic. Unfortunately some people in power tend to look down upon us once they know we're different and will try to get away with actions that they would never try on an allistic person. \n\nI would find another job unless you want to engage in a legal battle. I'm sorry you're going through this and you don't deserve to be treated differently than any other employee.", "I do know this, actually. The thing is, I am not really in need of any accommodations, I manage work fine, but I keep my neurodivergence off the record because I\u2019m concerned about being exploited/offered lower pay/not being hired. I do not disclose to businesses that I am autistic unless I have already been hired and feel comfortable doing so. Clearly divulging it here was a mistake.", "Since I'm using my car I'll get compensated for the wear and tear that will occur while operating it for work related purposes too, right?", "It\u2019s illegal for a company to not hire you or pay you less because you have a disability. I filled out my forms after I\u2019d already been hired and offered a wage. That\u2019s when I disclosed my disabilities & marked that I don\u2019t need accommodations. You don\u2019t have to if you\u2019re not comfortable with it though. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I made you feel like it was a mistake to disclose that info to us. That wasn\u2019t my intention here.. I was just trying to be helpful..", "Oh no, you didn\u2019t make me feel like that, my work environment has. I know that the things I mentioned are illegal, but I also know that that doesn\u2019t stop people from tossing out an app, not calling back an interviewee, or lowballing a potential hire. So I just try to keep it lowkey.", ">It\u2019s illegal for a company to not hire you or pay you less because you have a disability.\n\nWhile this is true, that doesn't mean it never happens.", "It\u2019s a hard line to walk when a lot of states in the US are right-to-work so it gives employers power to act up. I hope it\u2019s in our lifetimes that we can finally be open about our neurodivergence without worrying about discrimination.", "Correct. It can be safer not to disclose and I choose that for myself after having bad experiences.", "I agree. Not only does it happen, you need to have the means and information to deal with a discrimination case, and not everyone can access that. I think some companies count on that tbh. \n\nI honestly disclosed it at my job because I was afraid they\u2019d find out later & be mad I lied about not having a disability. I figured this way, it\u2019s on file if I *do* need accommodations, but maybe I fully screwed myself out of those forever since I marked no.", "The problem is proving it in a court of law that a business is discriminating based on any protected class. Employers know how to not get caught."]}
