It's a pretty flexible job and he has a lot of free time. He bills for 8 hours but he's told me that he finishes his workload by 11am most days. His boss and team love him and have been pretty good with his workload. He makes a little bit over $120k and apparently is slated for a raise every year. However last year (his second year at the company) he did not get a raise and when I asked him about it he said he's not sure why. A few months go by and I asked about it again and he said he's too awkward asking for it.. and that he never really bothered because he feels like an imposter and felt guilty approaching it. He finally bit the bullet and asked and he ended up getting a 10k raise.. if asked a year ago (when he was entitled to it) we could have been getting $900 more per month that could have gone to savings/retirement/home renos etc. \n\nThis made me really frustrated! I do all the financial planning, savings accounts, health insurance, and retirement accounts. Before I started my new job I spent weeks going over my new contract with a lawyer and I made sure to ask exactly how bonuses, raises, and paid leave are all structured. Yet my husband just signed his contract in an afternoon. In fact he jokingly tells me that he asked for a certain amount without researching what his position makes and they had to tell him that it was low and gave him a higher billing pay. \n\nI told him that it's frustrating that I try to so hard to make sure I get everything in writing and paid properly and he's just blase about it. He said that it's different since I am in medicine at a large hospital and he's in an IT company where everyone is chill. His boss has been a great mentor to him and gave him many opportunities. We have a toddler boy and my husband has been the primary caretaker for him and his boss has been understanding and given him the flexibility for doctor's appointments, childcare etc as needed and that's why he felt awkward asking for it. But the thing is that his boss isn't paying him.. his boss is just his manager and the salary structure is set much higher than him. I got upset and told him that if he asked earlier he could have gotten another raise in a few months but he thinks he gets paid too much already. He said that he kinda worries that they'll let him go if he gets too expensive.. but they're a large company with a lot of projects coming to him. \n\nAITA for being frustrated with him and telling him that I don't trust him when it comes to managing money? He lashed out saying that he takes care of everything at home including meal prepping and taking care of a toddler and that I'm being too hard on him for this one thing.. but it's kind of a big thing no?\n\nEdit: to address quite a few comments asking for info:\n\n1.) What expenses do you have: my husband's student loans, car payments, mortgage, imminent childcare as a second child is on the way\n\n2.) What exactly do you do? And how much do you bring in as a contribution?: I work as a physician and bring in about $280-290k. I am responsible for managing the money, accounts, health/dental insurance. Household chores have not been much lately as I am 8 months pregnant and work about 8-9 hrs a day. \n\n3.) What makes you think he's financially irresponsible?: He doesn't pay off his loans on time as he's forgetful, his bills have gone unpaid sometimes and went into collections.\n\nI do realize after reading the comments that I've been quite harsh with him and I will apologize and talk to him later tonight.", "created_utc": 1690463695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b1m6z/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont_trust_him/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Two to three hours of work per day? \n\nThat is what allows him to be the primary caretaker for your child. His boss\u2019s flexibility with your husband\u2019s work schedule is what allows your husband to be able to take your child to appointments and provide childcare.\n\nWith a different job, your child might have to be in daycare. You and your husband would have to take time off from work for appointments and the like.\n\nBecause of the nature of your husband\u2019s job, he is very likely saving you money related to the care of your child. In addition, it sounds as if he does the majority of the cooking and a lot of the work around the house. \n\nOr in other words, your husband does a majority of the home work that allows you to work the job you have without having to worry about the house or your child.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you would put a dollar value to everything that your husband does. But maybe create a scenario where he makes double what he does now, but must work 60-70 hours a week in office.\n\nHow are the two of you managing child care now? How takes time off to run your sick child to the doctor? Who is planning, shopping for, and cooking dinner? Who is doing the laundry?\n\nHow much is all this costing you, both in terms of money and energy/time?\n\nPartners contribute more than just money to a marriage, but you seem to have reduced your husband to a paycheck.", "A lot of tech companies have been doing layoffs in the past few years and some have put freezes on raises.

He is bringing in a full-time salary, plus is the primary caretaker for your child. ALL of you are incredibly lucky that he is in that position. He is being mindful of his job's culture and appreciative of the flexibility he is being allowed. \n\n\nYou are applying YOUR job's dynamics to his situation, wanting him to quantify his contributions in dollar amounts, and finding him lacking. I think you need to take a look at the whole picture and the overall fortune of the family unit (riches aren't only counted in $$), and quit looking solely at the monetary bottom line.", "YTA - you do sound harsh holy cow. that\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say you don\u2019t trust him and really hurtful to say about something pretty minor imo. You should selfish and ungrateful. He\u2019s already making insanely good money and it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t eventually ask for the raise after some encouragement. Where are you getting these crazy expectations from. It sounds like you don\u2019t appreciate him and are dismissing what he contributes.\n\nYour husband is right that if he asks for too much too fast they could find someone else. It\u2019s a legitimate fear you are dismissing. he\u2019s done very well for himself by average standard. Why don\u2019t you trust him to decide for himself? Or at least communicate better without getting so dismissive.", "YTA Jesus Christ this was a chore to read. Your man gonna get SNATCHED UP by someone who appreciates  him.  Hire a lawyer to go over this post. Ty.", "My decision was made in the first paragraph.  You are.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is his job, his his salary negotiation, his thoughts, feelings, and approach.  You literally have nothing to do with any of it except benefitting from it regardless of which direction he goes.  You are expressing frustration that he didn't do something that would benefit you more because his pesky thoughts, feelings, and approach got in the way of you getting your hands on that additional cash.   Whether that comes from a good place or a bad one is irrelevant.  Hopefully you can see where your overbearing over his job and salary are wrong.  Furthermore, it seems to me that you might be frustrated because you have assumed the typically masculine role in employment, and he has opted to assume the more feminine role.  He is taking care of the kid, and making choices based on flexibility, and operating on feelings rather than cold hard logic as men typically do. \n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that this does not come as a surprise to you.. but a person's manager is instrumental in the assessment and granting of pay raises.  That manager's opinion can quash any sort of pay raise the worker is getting.  If you need proof, have worked in IT a long time, I make VERY good money at it, but was up for a raise a few months ago.  There was a fuck up, not mine, but I got the both sets of tracks across the back when the bus came though.  My boss said that he was trying to justify my raise, and shit like this does not help him do that.  I told him on the spot, keep it.  He was like.. \"no, no, no.. well...\" I said \"dead serious, if I am not performing at a level to warrant a raise, you don't give it to me, period\".  Him: \"well I am still going to get it done, I am your manager I don't care if you like it or not.\" I ended the conversation with, \"this shit is not my fault, we will see that very soon, regardless take it off the table, we can talk about it next year, I don't want it.\"   Low and behold, the raise is not on the table anymore, and discussion is pushed to 2024.  (Subsequently, it was proven that I had nothing to do with the problem, and now that the bump has been moved it cannot be undone, and my manager is now taking flack because he fucked up believing I my stellar performance was marred by a bush league mistake.  They are actually worried that I am going to walk, and I may.  Back to topic though.. HR may give the final signatures, but a manager gives them the justification to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is not wrong at all about being cut.  Until you find a spot like I have right now in IT where the pain of replacing you outweighs the pain of keeping you happy its anyone's ball game.  The last company I worked for decided that all of their older workers were making too much, and decided to cut us (pure ageism).  We all walked away with fat severance and new jobs almost immediately.  They hired green kids who didn't know shit from shine-ola.  I drive past their ever shrinking footprint every now and again, and it is clear they are on the verge of folding, another story for another time though.\n\n\n\n\nIf he is accurate that he is keeping home, taking care of the kid, and doing a full time job (even if he is brutally efficient at it) then in my eyes your comment is not only hurtful, but it is also hypercritical.  While you may be on the nose when it comes to his negotiation skills, it is a complete asshole move to lay it on your SO the way you are doing.  How is that supposed to help him?  How is it supposed to encourage him?  I suppose that with  your criticism, you also offered solutions?", ">He bills for 8 hours but he's told me that he finishes his workload by 11am most days.

How grasping are you that you'd harangue your husband over an annual increase being missed during the tail end of the pandemic!  He makes $120k and you're mad it's not $130k.  Get over yourself.  Most people aren't as greedy as you.\n\nAlso do you know how crazy you need to be to get a lawyer to review your employment contract?  That's ridiculous.  Sure review your T&Cs and make sure you're being treated fairly, that doesn't require paying a lawyer!  I say this as a lawyer!  Google the terms you don't understand and compare the package against similar positions advertised in your area.", "So he makes the money and is primary caretaker for the child - what do you contribute besides criticizing him for being inadequate?

He\u2019s bringing home a very decent salary, he\u2019s being the primary caretaker for your child and just because your brain works the way it does  doesn\u2019t mean his does.

Not everyone is the same.\n\nAlso 10k a year is not an extra $900 a month to spend. Especially if you're already making 120k a year.

But you're not hurting, you're not in a bad situation, and your husband is bringing a lot more to the table than just his salary.

You have a different viewpoint on earnings and raises than he does. Neither is wrong. You are both in different fields so you cannot 100% understand the culture where he is. Just because YOU pour over every word in a contract and ensure you know exactly when raises happen (which life happens and even then things change and can mess with the schedule) doesn\u2019t mean he is wrong to not do so. Making him do something he is uncomfortable with can actually harm his relationship with his manager and therefore affect his raise possibilities. Further, you didn\u2019t know that asking for the raise would result in anything or if it could have been more than the $10,000. You are using information after the fact to argue with him about before the fact actions. \n\nLet him approach his job as he sees fit.

It's a pretty flexible job and he has a lot of free time. He bills for 8 hours but he's told me that he finishes his workload by 11am most days. His boss and team love him and have been pretty good with his workload. He makes a little bit over $120k and apparently is slated for a raise every year. However last year (his second year at the company) he did not get a raise and when I asked him about it he said he's not sure why. A few months go by and I asked about it again and he said he's too awkward asking for it.. and that he never really bothered because he feels like an imposter and felt guilty approaching it. He finally bit the bullet and asked and he ended up getting a 10k raise.. if asked a year ago (when he was entitled to it) we could have been getting $900 more per month that could have gone to savings/retirement/home renos etc. \n\nThis made me really frustrated! I do all the financial planning, savings accounts, health insurance, and retirement accounts. Before I started my new job I spent weeks going over my new contract with a lawyer and I made sure to ask exactly how bonuses, raises, and paid leave are all structured. Yet my husband just signed his contract in an afternoon. In fact he jokingly tells me that he asked for a certain amount without researching what his position makes and they had to tell him that it was low and gave him a higher billing pay. \n\nI told him that it's frustrating that I try to so hard to make sure I get everything in writing and paid properly and he's just blase about it. He said that it's different since I am in medicine at a large hospital and he's in an IT company where everyone is chill. His boss has been a great mentor to him and gave him many opportunities. We have a toddler boy and my husband has been the primary caretaker for him and his boss has been understanding and given him the flexibility for doctor's appointments, childcare etc as needed and that's why he felt awkward asking for it. But the thing is that his boss isn't paying him.. his boss is just his manager and the salary structure is set much higher than him. I got upset and told him that if he asked earlier he could have gotten another raise in a few months but he thinks he gets paid too much already. He said that he kinda worries that they'll let him go if he gets too expensive.. but they're a large company with a lot of projects coming to him. \n\nAITA for being frustrated with him and telling him that I don't trust him when it comes to managing money? He lashed out saying that he takes care of everything at home including meal prepping and taking care of a toddler and that I'm being too hard on him for this one thing.. but it's kind of a big thing no?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You sound controlling and overbearing. Back off.", "YTA, but way softer than most of the answers. I think what we\u2019re dealing with here is a classic clash in personality. \n\nOP, I don\u2019t think what you\u2019re mad about or the issue is the money part of the raise - you guys clearly have enough money. The issue is that you are a detail-oriented person and your husband isn\u2019t. You NEED to go over these details in the contracts, he doesn\u2019t and is much more laid back and go with the flow, and this is causing you anxiety. That nonchalant tendency mixed with the fact that if not for you he forgets to pay his bills on time, and that he has student loans and you don\u2019t, is I think the real issue and not getting a raise is just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, not the actual problem. It doesn\u2019t matter if the raise was for one dollar or one million, the problem is that you are having issues due to your own anxiety and rigidity trusting your husband and looking for proof that he\u2019s unreliable. \n\nThe solution to this is probably a short stint in couple\u2019s counseling, but it may help to also a) voice this concern to your husband in a more reasonable, general way instead of focusing on one individual instance and b) focus on the ways he is reliable instead of looking for ways he isn\u2019t. Since he\u2019s a SAHD, this should be easy. Does he reliably show up when your son needs him? Reliably do feedings, diaper changes, keep to a nap schedule, etc? Does he keep on top of his share of chores? Cooking? Is he punctual? I think you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a lot of ways he is reliable, but just he might need you in order to remember to keep to certain dates or deal with financial stuff, and it\u2019s a sign you two are compatible that you happen to be good at the things he\u2019s bad at, and vice versa.", "Yta", "YTA, also, you all should check out OPs post history, this isn't the first time she's posted about hating her husband.

It\u2019s great you\u2019re assertive, you can balance each other out\u2026or fight him to be like you.\n\nLastly, he\u2019s right IT culture is different in terms of being casual, in appearance and interpersonal skills at the very least. And it\u2019s normal that tech guys are not elbow rubbing, negotiating, business types. Yours is not the only perspective or a right way to some wrong of his. Trust he does know somethings to be worth more like you most likely rightfully see\u2026and like anyone he has weaker traits and that\u2019s ok.

I get a raise every year, sometimes it\u2019s trivially small, sometimes it isn\u2019t, I just thank them and carry on. \n\nI\u2019ve grown up with people who worry about money all the time and who need to micromanage every few quid they have and organise their finances strictly, I hated it, I worked hard to get in a position where I don\u2019t need to do that. I know some people who do need to, and it\u2019s not fun to watch them live a life of stress over it, but what I hate more than anything else is when other people expect me to obsess over finances simply because they do. \n\nOnce you reach the point that you\u2019re able to pay the bills and have cash left over, worrying about your income is entirely optional depending on your goals and if his goal is anything like mine, which is simply to reduce stress as much as possible and maximise free time, he\u2019s doing the right thing. \n\nWe don\u2019t live forever and I\u2019d rather enjoy my time while I\u2019m here.

If he\u2019s forgetting to pay expenses, can\u2019t you just set up direct debits and forget about it?

Sort out your priorities.", "Reddit, especially AITA, will find faults in even the saint-est OPs post here, given that you were an AH in this story only riled them up. I'm happy you took the criticism (and some insults ngl) and are seeing you are in the wrong and would like to better yourself.\n\nPlease go ahead and block or ignore those AHs calling you vile names just because you acted like an AH one time. You don't deserve that much cruelty or harsh words from anyone.\n\nHave a conversation with your husband and apologise and explain your POV without getting defensive and try to resolve any lingering issues. \n\nWhile reddit does love updates, I won't blame you if you don't feel comfortable updating us after you receive this much backlash. But I do hope it works out for you.\n\nPS : I did read your other post too. Make sure you set firm boundaries with your parents and have your husband's back on his stance. You can't take ANY chances especially when it's your kid's safety.\n\nGood luck.", "You're welcome. I don't like how Reddit sometimes knocks the woman who complains about a high wage earning man. They just assumed you weren't pulling your weight in the relationship, and clearly you are. Handling all the finances takes a lot of work, and so does working as a physician every day. Add pregnancy to that and you have the perfect recipe for someone who will be frustrated . . . by something. \n\nPeople here are altogether willing to encourage people to get divorced, when it's reframing and communication that are needed. Good luck to the both of you and your growing family!", "Yeah, that's BS. They are paying for his time and if they knew he was working only 3 hours a day they would be giving him a lot more work or cutting his hours. They are not paying him to be a stay at home dad.", "Yeah I need to let it go. But I guess I should have clarified that he was supposed to get that raise a year ago but he never asked and they never bothered. In fact when he brought it up.. they said sorry you're right.. here's the raise. That's why I was irritated.", "A very greedy person! Life will not be improved in any meaningful way by that amount.", "Even worse, she\u2019s updated saying she makes $290k a year. \nI\u2019m crying.", "Agreed.  Hubby makes what he makes for 3 hours of work per day and then proceeds to run the day to day operation of the household.  OP spends 8 hours a day away from home but does little to nothing in comparison to her partner to contribute to the smoothly running household.   \n\nMeanwhile OP counts the money and complains.  You see, the things she contributes are the most important because of the dollar value assigned to her work.  Hubby's contributions don't matter because an outside party hasn't affirmed that with a check. \n\nGross.  YTA", "Okay I get that OPs are not supposed to be defensive in these threads but I'm not sure where you get the following? \n\n\"He makes more than you\" \n\nI never made that claim. In fact (I don't think it's important but since you made that assumption twice) I make more than twice what he makes.\n\n\"And all you do is complain and criticize him\"\n\nI complained ONCE and the result of that was why I was seeking advice from this thread.", "But sometimes she pays the power bill!!!!!! Isn't that amazing?\n\n/S \n\nShe's trash and I hope he finds better", "It is called wage theft. He could get in trouble for this, unless they know he is only working 2-3 hours per 8 hour shift. Which they undoubtedly don't.", "yea , if husband ever reads this. id be filing for divorce ASAP.\n\ntoo many red flags with this one.", "You really need to step back, look at the big picture and appreciate how fortunate your circumstances are.\n\nYou have a very, VERY comfortable combined take home, he does the childcare and cooking and you sound like you absolutely zero appreciation for your family's position or him.\n\nHe's in a very at risk industry and he's probably doing the right thing not rocking the boat. Different workplaces have different atmospheres and social dynamics. He can't just act how you would and expect it to go well.\n\nLearn to appreciate what you have before you chase what you don't.", "Oh no, you mean you made more than $400K a year combined instead of slightly more? How ever will you both survive!? /S\n\nSome of us have real struggles, Nancy.", "Wait, you make 240k a year, he makes 120, and it's STILL not enough? You are fucking insane.", "How lavishly are you living that u can't live on your combined income just let this shit go man jesus", "I understand that knowing your worth and being compensated accordingly is important (not you, but the general \u201cyou\u201d). But in your specific case, why is that raise so important to your household and family? You\u2019re not struggling financially, clearly. \n\nWhat would the raise have been? And how much would that difference have impacted your life, if at all? How much would it have affected your husband\u2019s relationship with his boss and his company? \n\nI think if it was said he should get a raise then he should, and your husband should be able to speak up for himself. But also, sometimes it\u2019s best not to look a gift horse in the mouth. \n\nDoes he have 1-1s with his boss? Maybe he can bring it up then. Or you and your husband talk about a plan of action when is 3rd year rolls around, if it comes to that, so you\u2019re all on the same page about his income. \n\nMostly, I\u2019m just trying to understand why this raise is so important to you", "\\> I make more than twice what he makes.   \n\n\nGood, I'm glad you contribute something to the household besides negativity!", "So you make at least 240k, he makes 120k, so you're household income is around 360k and you're still moaning about 900?\n\nYou don't need to spend anything on childcare as your husband is doing that.\n\nYour husband does the household chores.\n\nYou have been complaining about him though, just cause he didn't ask for 900 more on top of 120k", "If you're trying to get sympathy from the average person because your nearly half million dollar annual income was slightly lower than it could have been... Good luck.", "You flat fucking liar. There is ZERO way you wouldn't have included that in the post if it were true. You are the type of money focused B that wouldn't be able to resist. \n\nBullshit to the nth degree", "You have not complained once. Your entire Reddit history is a long list of complaints.", "So now you're here. Complaining about making nearly 500k a year? Are you fucking serious? Have any idea how many people would be head over heels excited to have a fourth of what you guys have? You'd rather look at the bitter grapes than look at the bounty that was laid out before you.", "LOL not per hr if he's putting in 3 hours a day", ">I complained ONCE and the result of that was why I was seeking advice from this thread.\n\nLooking at your post history maybe your husband does need to get out of there and get that sweet alimony and child support. It seems you routinely make him the scapegoat for your bad feelings.", "Him only being assigned 3 hours of work does not mean he's committing wage theft. It's on his management team to increase his workload if they don't feel like he's earning the money they pay.", "Omg what a corporate kiss ass. Are you serious?", "He's earning 120, taking care of the kid, taking care of the house and she's acting like he's going out and blowing all their money gambling.  The guy sounds super responsible and yet being treated like the opposite, OVER a 10k raise when they were already make over 400k combined.\n\nMost people would be happy their kid gets to see a parent every day and that parent still has time to earn a wage well over the national average.  But nope, he's a bum somehow.", "The reason I thought it was important was that this was something that was scheduled to have happened a year ago anyway (it was in his contract). We also have student loans (him much more than me), car payments, and a house we just bought so mortgage payments, a second kid on the way, etc and I just want to prepare for the future in savings and retirement.", "He must let his management know he isn't being fully utilized. What fantasy world do you live in? People like this are why WFH will die.", "i think its because he doesn't pay his bills on time.....LOL....probably because he is knee deep in childcare and chores.", "So you have a second kid coming (congrats!).  Do you realize how much you are saving on child care? Maybe your husband is reading the room, he makes 120k for less than 20 hours a week.  \n\nEveryone should know their worth, but it sounds like he knows he is being overpaid and doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat.  What if they said we will give you 10k but now you also have to do xyz and it means he can\u2019t watch the kids.\n\nYou are around 350k of income, you are not going to find much sympathy here when many people literally do not have enough food to eat or pay for any car.  If your funds are so tight that 10k is going to make the difference, you are doing something wrong.  Too big of a house, too fancy of a car, even with school loans that is a lot of freaking money.\n\nYou also sound like you do not value his work with either the children or his job.  He makes enough money to live independently, I would leave you, the lack of respect would be a deal breaker.", "Ok that\u2019s fair, and you have a point. But he has a point too, he does do a lot around the house, and unpaid household labour counts for A LOT. \n\nIf the raise is that important, then he needs to be included in the financial planning so you both are coming at this from the same perspective. You should also come up with some kind of rough statement of how much his household labour saves you, ex childcare, cleaning, etc", "Why don't you try showing him how much you love and appreciate him instead of beating him down hmm?", "Tens of thousands of people handle these same expenses with exponentially less money. Touch some grass."]}
