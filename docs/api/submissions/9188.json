First time poster.\n\nContext: I (29F) \"Jane Doe\" just got married to my husband (36M) \"John Smith.\" We live on the east coast of the US outside of a major city. I am from here and he is originally from the midwest, moved around a lot for work, and ended up in the major city, where we met via popular online connection site. We started dating in late 2019. When COVID hit, the industry he was working in shut down completely. I work in health care and had more than enough paid work to make ends meet. I dragged him out to live in the suburbs and we started our life together. I floated us financially and his parents also gave him some money to get by until the government programs kicked in and until he could find a new job.\n\nMy husband's family is plenty nice and they're good people, but even after three years I still don't feel like I'm a part of his family. I did tell my husband this after the last time we visited them. I was a little sad about not feeling like I fit in, but chalked it up to distance and difference in culture, and moved on.\n\nWhen we got engaged in late 2021, we set a wedding date for late 2023. During the course of wedding planning, a few things changed for us and we got legally married in late 2022 so I could hop on my husband's health insurance. We still have our \"ceremony\" and reception planned for the original date in 2023 for all friends and family to attend.\n\nWe received a card from my husband's grandfather who also sent a generous check to \"John and Jane Smith.\" I was a little annoyed because I made sure everyone knew I was not changing my name.\n\nIn the same card was a check wrote out to \"Jane Smith\" for a small amount and a sticky note on it that read \"late christmas. you weren't part of the family when I mailed the others.\" When my husband received his yearly Christmas present from his grandpa a mere four weeks earlier, I thought that was a nice gesture of him and didn't think anything else of it. I certainly didn't feel left out. I consulted my coworkers the next day about what I should do and they helped me draft this letter;\n\n\"Dear Grandpa,\n\nI hope you had a lovely new year. John and I received your card congratulating us on our wedding. The card and enclosed check were very kind considering we weren't expecting any gifts until our originally planned ceremony and reception at the end of this year, which we hope you will be able to attend. Thank you for thinking of us and for your generosity on our special day.\n\nI also wanted to thank you for the delayed Christmas gift. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept it. Firstly, because my name is, and will remain, Jane Doe, and cashing it is impossible. Secondly, because I didn't realize that I 'wasn't part of the family' a month ago when you wrote the other checks. I didn't feel left out until you pointed it out.\n\nKind regards, Jane Doe\"\n\nI put the check, with the sticky note still on it, in with the letter and sent it to him. So, AITA for sending back his check with the letter?", "created_utc": 1675602388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10uc0zr/aita_because_i_sent_back_a_monetary_christmas/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You already mentioned you already didn't \"feel part of the family.\" Well... Spoiler Alert : you've probably destroyed any chance of feeling accepted and part of the family.\n\nDid you let your husband know that you did this?? Or, is he about to be blindsided with a barrage of angry phone calls??? Yikes.\n\nYou cant articulate your purpose for doing this. And you should have included your HUSBAND in dealing with HIS family. YTA.\n\nBut, hey, you may now end up saving a ton of money on your family ceremony and reception later this year.", "YTA. For many people, especially older people, you\u2019re not part of the family until you are married. He wasn\u2019t excluding you, he just has a more traditional idea of what \u201cpart of the family\u201d means. You could have just kept the cheque without cashing it and sent a thank you. This is not going to endear you to your inlaws.", "YTA. This is why you don't fit in. You took a generous gesture, didn't like a few things in it, and decided it was ill intentioned. \n\nIntent is key. This is an older gentleman who grew up in a different time and likely had no intentions of being cruel. In the period of time he grew up in, taking a last name and not sending gifts until someone was a spouse was \"normal\". \n\nWhat a condescending letter to send. It's mean. You could have handled this in so many other ways, like a phone call just letting him know or correcting him the next time you saw him.", "YTA - the lack of understanding for the elderly and the lack of appreciation for the gift says it all. Do you feel better now that you have thoroughly embarrassed an elderly man trying to welcome you into the family?", "YTA you need to explain what you mean by \"I don't feel like part of the family\" glossing over that just sounds like irrational emotions being projected onto other people. Many people don't fit in with their own family but they don't get all sad about it they just understand different strokes for different folks.\n\nAnd then you consulted your coworker about the letter vs your husband, having conversations with outside people before your partner is such a violation, makes me wonder how much you've conversed before all this and coming to reddit.\n\nLastly if you felt your husband would not be of a reasonable mind or have a conversation about it,  or if he's been dismissing your feelings on this before.... I would question, why are you married to him if you can't trust him? This situation isn't something that just started or something that just goes away.\n\nYou're playing with fire if he's always taken their side prior, or if he has dismissed your feeling on it.\n\nEfc", "YTA. You consulted your coworkers (instead of your husband) for this backhanded letter because you knew you were in the wrong.

You didn't feel like part of the family before, just wait.", "Way to cut off your nose to spite your face. I don't think you have to worry about 'feeling' like you arent part of the family now,  the next time you see them,  they will make it very clear you arent and never will be family to them. \n\nI get the urge to be petty,  but you should have ignored your coworkers and instead put that check aside as a funny story to tell after grandpa died or just let your husband deal with  it.\n\nYou have pretty much ruined your relationship with your inlaws and you have no one to blame but yourself,  all because you had to be as petty as an old man.\n\nYTA learn to pick your battles.", "YTA at every turn here. The name is a minor annoyance that you need to let go. You can be hurt by the not part of the family comment, but you've reacted in a petty and condescending way. Your entire post is dripping with condescension.", "I\u2019m going to be downvoted for this, but you sound so unappreciative and insufferable. Your title says you sent it back because it was four weeks late, but what you really meant is that he offended you and made the check out to your spouse\u2019s last name instead of your maiden name. Give the elderly folks in your life a break. YTA.", "YTA.  you started  dating a few months before a lockdown so no one got together for months and then in very small numbers.\n\nMaybe Granpa was unaware you didn't change your name.   I didn't know DIL kept her maiden name until few months after the wedding when I sent her a pkg from Amazon.  \n\nFrankly, the second paragraph would piss me off if I received that letter from my grandschild's  spouse.", "Wow. Major AH. If they didn't dislike you before, they will now. If my husband spoke to my grandpa that way, we'd be sleeping apart and going to counseling.", "YTA. Why did you draft the letter with your co workers rather than your husband, who may be able to give context regarding his grandpa?\n\nElderly folks don't always get a pass, but this chap was trying to be nice. Traditionally you aren't part of the family til you're legally part of the family aka married. And he probably forgot, or wasn't told by other relatives, that you were keeping your name.\n\nYou were defensive and ungracious. Good luck being part of the family now.", "If you sent back the check with that note, don't expect a replacement check. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nFirst, you can cash the check. You sign the name written on it and your legal name. Banks deal with this all the time. \n\nYou will get checks written out to incorrectly. Many people forget or think it\u2019s just a professional thing or it\u2019s a habit, especially for a certain generation.\n\nSending the check back was rude, some people don\u2019t consider family until you are married. I don\u2019t like, but it\u2019s how they are. It also seems you don\u2019t live near them and might not see them as much. You also mention different cultures and that may play into it. \n\nYou could have just not cashed the check.\n\nDid you talk to your husband that you were going to do this or just did it because work friends who do not know these people told you to?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you hoped to accomplish with your note and the check, but if it was hurting people and starting your marriage off on a negative note with your in laws, congratualtions on achieving that.", "YTA it doesn't sound like the family DID anything to you actively to make you feel unwelcome. You say they're nice people, just that you don't quite mesh with them just yet. Getting your last name wrong seems like more a mistake than anything hostile on Grandpa's part. And if you're feeling so left out...why would you send Grandpa a check like that, when he's trying to do something nice for you? It just sounds so counterintuitive.", "YTA.\n\nThe amount of pettiness from this. Did you let your husband's family know that you were not going to change your name? \"I made sure they knew.\" How did you make sure? \n\nLike the other comments, you will definitely not be apart of the family now and for good reason. That was just hateful.", "You said you don\u2019t feel like you fit in with the family. Well this is definitely not going to help you and will almost certainly make things worse. It\u2019s also concerning that you talked to your coworker about it instead of your husband. Not a good sign for the communication in your marriage.", "YTA.  So he sent you a check, made out to the married name you're not going to use. It's not gonna create that many issues for you to cash it.  You go to the bank, present the check, your photo, and your marriage license. Easy-peasy.  You are mad because he sent you a check 4 weeks after your husband got his because you guys weren't married yet. How petty are you?\n\n Grandpa, I'm gonna bet is in at least his 80s. So many people would die to have their grandparents still around. And here you go, ruining a relationship.  You sit here and say how you don't feel like you fit in. Well, this sure isn't gonna help your case at all. If by some chance your marriage works out past this, I guarantee you, you will never get a present from his family again.  But look at it this way, maybe grandpa can give that money to your husband to pay for the divorce attorney.", "YTA but that was your intent when you send that so it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any issue here.", "Sorry, babe, YTA. Big time. This is your husband\u2019s grandfather, not his parent. Way to turn a sweet gesture into a personal insult. \n\nChanging one\u2019s name is just a safe assumption due to tradition. I can\u2019t stand when people get offended when others assume they\u2019ll change their name when they get married. It\u2019s a very common practice. You can\u2019t expect everyone to make note that you\u2019ll be keeping your name. Especially not someone as removed (and, by the way, elderly) as your grandfather-in-law. \n\nAnd making the point about \u201cnot being a part of the family\u201d before. Get over yourself. \n\nAlso, I would bet you the amount of the check that if you deposited it in an ATM, it would post to your account just fine.", "YTA. I got secondhand embarrassment from that letter. It's so common for a new bride to take her husband's name after marriage that grandpa's mistake is understandable and forgivable. Even if he had been told beforehand that you chose to keep your maiden name, you don't think for one minute that he just forgot? Or even that nobody told him until after he had already mailed his letter? Regardless, all it warranted was a thank you and polite reminder.\n\n\"Thank you very much for your generous gift! However, I did keep my maiden name of [whatever], just for future use. I hope you are well and look forward to seeing you soon!\"\n\nLiterally so easy to be grateful and get your point across. You just wanted to be petty. Do you still wonder why his family doesn't fully accept you yet? Because I've got a pretty good idea.", "INFO You wrote that you made sure that everyone knew you weren't changing your name. But it doesn't matter what everyone knew. It only matters what your husband's grandfather knew. He's also probably quite old, considering that your husband is in his mid 30s. It's hard to generate sympathy for you when you're upset that some old man either forgot or didn't realize that you're not changing your last name. But if you have other evidence that he's doing so specifically just to be a jerk to you, that would be worth mentioning.\n\nI don't see how the timing makes you look good. You wrote that you got married late in the year, and since you haven't had the big ceremony yet, it's natural that people will be delayed when sending you presents. But that's only one issue.\n\nI'm also trying to figure out what you hope to accomplish. Are you standing up for yourself because you think now the old man will respect you? Are you standing up for yourself because you wish your husband would have? It's certainly okay to confront and jerks with their jerk-face ways, but I'm confused about your objective.", "YTA for what you said in response, you cannot deposit or cash the check if it's not in your name so you should have sent it back informing him that you can't cash it just so he knows. But the additional comments to it makes you the AH. You're not going to ever feel like you belong in the family if you keep yourself out of it. \n\nHe didn't have to send anything at all. He did anyway even if it was late, if you continue to get anything from him in the future I'd be surprised.", "YTA\n\nWow that was petty. What exactly do you expect to gain from that? \n\nYou really did just disrespect the grandpa, can\u2019t wait for an update of how you\u2019ve been ostracised from the family.", "YTA, good luck with this little time bomb.\n\nYou don't feel like you belong in family, so you engage in behavior that affirms your belief.  This will eventually sabotage your relationship and I am sure you will have a good reason for why things fell apart due to someone who you think has alienated you from his side of the family. Compounded by statements of \"I was just \\_\\_\\_\\_\" whatever to minimize your own evolvement.", "YTA. It was a nice gesture from an elderly man. He probably forgot you weren\u2019t changing your name. You are not the star of everyone\u2019s show, ya know?", "Talk about a self fulfilled prophecy.  If you felt left out of the family before, then you just handed gramps any everyone who listens to his story all the evidence and cause for leaving you out of the family.  Your response had little tact.", "The entitlement.  You\u2019re an ungrateful AH, get over yourself.", "YTA, this may be one of the first time's someone has done something so petty even the AITA crowd aren't into it. What kind of a person would do this? For a lot of people, marriage is the ceremony that 'officially' makes someone family, especially in older generations. Those generations *also* had last name changing by default. It's an honest mistake that could have been easily rectified with a phone call.\n\nInstead you decided to be a massive, gaping asshole about it. I don't think there'll be any problems with you feeling like 'part of the family' - now I doubt you ever will be. Enjoy a lifetime of your in-laws hating you, and with good reason. Even if the granddad *had* said something horrible, which he didn't, drafting a letter like that is something cartoon characters do - and in those episode, the character usually learns a lesson about not being an asshole. Jesus Christ. Blown away by this one, if it's real.", "YTA yikes!!! I think you took this too far and it could have been handled with some kind communication", "YTA.\n\nThis really hits a nerve because my grandparents wrote check to all the married grandchildren and spouses for Christmas. For our family it\u2019s based on cultural tradition.\n\nWriting you one was a way to welcome you into the family, something you say you wanted. Instead you sent it back because it wasn\u2019t a welcome on your terms.\n\nIf you want people to like you and treat you kindly then you need to accept their kindness. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything intentionally insulting here, just an older person with a more traditional belief system wanting their new granddaughter in law to feel included.\n\nAnd now I miss my grandparents, and am remembering how I was hoping my partner\u2019s name would make it on an envelope because that would mean my grandparents lived a few months more, how it didn\u2019t happen, and how my parents made sure they had envelopes for us the Christmas after the wedding.", "YTA.  No wonder you\u2019re not fitting in with the family. You took a nice gesture and made it a dramatic offence to yourself. No one wants to be around someone they have to tiptoe around.", "YTA\n\nBut congratulations on having in-laws who picked up on your pettiness.\ud83e\udd73 I'm sure they'll fling their hearts and doors wide open after Grandpa tells them about your note. Anything else on the menu to isolate your husband from his family?", "YTA\n\nYou met petty with petty.", "YTA.  No wonder they don't like you.  You are the problem here.", "YTA\n\nGreat way to finally \"fit in with the family\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "YTA, that was nasty and mean. Idc if you told them before that you weren't changing your name. Maybe Grandpa forgot? You're not the main character.", "YTA. You just suffered an accidental minor graze, but retaliated with nuclear war. Good luck becoming part of the family.", "YTA.  I\u2019ve been married to my husband for 17 years, never changed my last name to his last name, and his family and his friends still address cards, gifts, etc to Mr and Mrs Husband\u2019s Last Name.  It is so not a big deal to me.  At all.  What do I care?? \n\nAlso it\u2019s selfish to create an issue with your husband\u2019s family members.  \n\nThis is why so many people have issues with their in laws:  they choose to die on a hill of petty BS.", "YTA. I understand why the phrasing might have been hurtful to you but that was very unappreciative. How mortifying for you to have to stand in front of his family in a year after having treating the grandfather the way you did. And perhaps more importantly, it sounds like you didn\u2019t consult your husband at all on how you were going to handle your feelings with *his* grandfather, whom I assume is in his 80s and likely one of the most beloved members of his extended family\u2014not a particularly strong start to your nascent marriage. That story will spread across his family like wildfire and it\u2019s what the aunts and cousins who barely know you will be whispering about at the wedding, how they can\u2019t believe John is hitching his wagon to someone so disrespectful.

First time poster.\n\nContext: I (29F) \"Jane Doe\" just got married to my husband (36M) \"John Smith.\" We live on the east coast of the US outside of a major city. I am from here and he is originally from the midwest, moved around a lot for work, and ended up in the major city, where we met via popular online connection site. We started dating in late 2019. When COVID hit, the industry he was working in shut down completely. I work in health care and had more than enough paid work to make ends meet. I dragged him out to live in the suburbs and we started our life together. I floated us financially and his parents also gave him some money to get by until the government programs kicked in and until he could find a new job.\n\nMy husband's family is plenty nice and they're good people, but even after three years I still don't feel like I'm a part of his family. I did tell my husband this after the last time we visited them. I was a little sad about not feeling like I fit in, but chalked it up to distance and difference in culture, and moved on.\n\nWhen we got engaged in late 2021, we set a wedding date for late 2023. During the course of wedding planning, a few things changed for us and we got legally married in late 2022 so I could hop on my husband's health insurance. We still have our \"ceremony\" and reception planned for the original date in 2023 for all friends and family to attend.\n\nWe received a card from my husband's grandfather who also sent a generous check to \"John and Jane Smith.\" I was a little annoyed because I made sure everyone knew I was not changing my name. \n\nIn the same card was a check wrote out to \"Jane Smith\" for a small amount and a sticky note on it that read \"late christmas. you weren't part of the family when I mailed the others.\" When my husband received his yearly Christmas present from his grandpa a mere four weeks earlier, I thought that was a nice gesture of him and didn't think anything else of it. I certainly didn't feel left out. I consulted my coworkers the next day about what I should do and they helped me draft this letter;\n\nDear Grandpa,\n\nI hope you had a lovely new year. John and I received your card congratulating us on our wedding. The card and enclosed check were very kind considering we weren't expecting any gifts until our originally planned ceremony and reception at the end of this year, which we hope you will be able to attend. Thank you for thinking of us and for your generosity on our special day.\n\nI also wanted to thank you for the delayed Christmas gift. Unfortunately, I am unable to accept it. Firstly, because my name is, and will remain, Jane Doe, and cashing it is impossible. Secondly, because I didn't realize that I 'wasn't part of the family' a month ago when you wrote the other checks. I didn't feel left out until you pointed it out.\n\nKind regards, Jane Doe\n\nI put the check, with the sticky note still on it, in with the letter and sent it to him. So, AITA for sending back his check with the letter?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hoo Boy, update us on Gpa\u2019s response.

I understand your offended but there\u2019s no evidence of malice and I think you\u2019re being hella petty if you send the money back. \n\nDon\u2019t complain about not being included then when they make gesture to include you, you send it back.", "YTA, ouch, I don\u2019t know who your \u201ccoworkers \u201d are, but they are definitely not your \u201cfriends\u201d.

I can't believe none of your friends told you this wasn't a nice thing to do.  Sure grandpa was a little rude but it sounds like it was probably unintentional.  Can't you give him the benefit of the doubt and appreciate the fact that he did something for you instead of making a big issue over something small?  Get over yourself.", "YTA. Rather than try to work this out tactfully or respectfully, you went the burning bridge route? Interesting choice. You try to catch flies with vinegar don't you?", "You posted your response to grandpa like it\u2019s something to be proud of. It was rude and so are you. \n\nYTA", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sure he meant well and didn\u2019t mean to be offensive.

Did you show him what your Grandad sent and ask him what he thought you should do, or did you just ask your co-workers?

He's your husband and it's his family... it should be the first thing you do. I wonder about the future of your marriage if you didn't tell him. And what's he going to think when he hears what you did from his family? I can tell you right now if I did that to my husband's grandfather (I kept my own name, most on his side of the family don't use it, I don't care) my husband would be seriously reconsidering the person he thought I was. \n\nYou know the world doesn't revolve around you.
