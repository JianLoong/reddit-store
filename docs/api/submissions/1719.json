She announced she was pregnant and said \"she was feeling okay about the pregnancy as she wouldn't plan to have kids but since 'the accident' happened she will just keep it as a lot of celebrities are having babies and cute baby pics will get her more social media followers .\" \n\nI can't help but feel hurt and disgusted by her words, a child is not a inconvenience or a fashion accessory but a human being and it makes me so angry that she doesn't realise who lucky she is. She still drinks alcohol, wastes money on getting eyelashes done, hair done and builds up debt and hasn't bothered planning for babies arrival. She calls the baby \" the accident\" and does nothing but complain about how she doesn't want to be a mum and can't wait to \"get it out of her\" so her boyfriend can \"deal with it\" and she will borrow it when needed for photos ect.\n\nI am honestly appalled by her words and I know its not a nice emotion to have but I am jealous of her. I have avoided her at family gatherings and I declined an invite to her shower.\nAm I the AH for almost hating her (not for being pregnant but for being irresponsible and drinking everyweekend, and saying out loud how much she isn't looking forward to being a mum).\n\nI know jealousy is a horrible thing but I am human and after having several miscarriages 3 months, 5 1/2 months and a still birth at 7months) it's heart breaking to be around someone who is pregnant, decided to keep it but abuses her baby by drinking heavily and talks about how much she hates it.

You don't have to hang out with EVERYONE.\n\nAT LEAST you're doing both of you the favor of understanding your feelings, understanding this is kind of a \"you\" thing and avoiding her.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Feelings of jealousy are normal, and we all process in our own ways.", "NTA\n\nI don't think OP hates her solely because of jealousy. This woman openly hates kids and admits how she's gonna be abusive and neglectful towards her future kid and not to mention how she's super irresponsible. Personally I think that anyone with a little human decency would hate her and people in the comments are just ignoring all of that? Hello?", "NTA\n\nIf she\u2019s seriously drinking while pregnant and only having this baby for fame then I think you have a right to stay away", "NTA You have specifically removed yourself from the situation and are going to therapy.  Plus you are self aware enough to realize the jealousy isn\u2019t helpful. \n\nI would be staying away from this person also. I have no children myself but if she is constantly drinking and doing drugs, as you have pointed out in the comments, and obviously has no care for the baby based on those actions alone she would disgust me. Its better to remove yourself from the situation. \n\nAlso keep in mind its not anyone\u2019s fault that you are having difficulty trying to have more kids. Sometimes its just not in the cards for everyone. Have you considered fostering or even fostering with the option to adopt? You would be able to share your love and the resources you have with children that are in need.", "If she really is drinking and using drugs - NTA and in your place I would have a talk with social services. A person like that would probably neglect or even abuse her child. \nAlso, there is obviously much higher chance of the child being Born with birth defects and depending on how often she uses during pregnancy, there is a risk of fetal alcohol syndrome or the baby could be born addicted, which would also affect them long term and require specialized care.\nDepending on where you all live, if social services are notified before the birth and the hospital is contacted, they could test the baby right after they are born and take the necessary steps to protect them.", "NTA I'm shocked at the A. H ones. You have some feelings and it's not like you are telling her about them you are just staying away. You seem to be getting therapy too. I'm sorry for your losses and troubles conceiving.

It\u2019s not an asshole move to decline invitations and avoid someone that makes you feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not an asshole move that you need time to sort out your feelings about your fertility struggles. Sure, you may be jealous, but you haven\u2019t acted in a terrible way. You can say you hate the cousin and the unborn baby, but at the same time, people say stuff that sounds not the best, but you haven\u2019t treated anyone badly. If the baby was born and you treated the baby horribly, then you would be the asshole. It\u2019s not your fault that the cousin sounds like she would be a horribly irresponsible parent and has already shown as such by the things she\u2019s doing and saying. \n\n\n\n\nI know you state your already in therapy to address the jealousy issues, but if you aren\u2019t already there are therapist that specifically help address fertility that may help.", "NTA\n\nNobody is obliged to like everyone else.  You are entitled to your opinion and feelings about your husband's cousin's lifestyle while pregnant.  You haven't attacked her in any way, you are simply avoiding her.

It's ok to separate yourself from trainwrecks.", "NTA\n\nShe is openly treating her pregnancy like a disposable extension of herself. It's happening *to her*, it inconveniences *her*. She can't wait to not have to *deal* with it. She isn't planning for her baby's immediate or long term future and in fact, sounds like she's an incredibly un-self-aware person who setting herself and her child up for a fairly miserable time. From what you say she comes across as disrespectful, un-enthused and uneducated about the institution of motherhood. Is actually quite vocal about plans to use this tiny person for petty social gain instead of raising it to be a happy healthy human being. She is drinking on weekends because easing her own boredom is, repeatedly, more important to her than the safety of the child she doesn't want to acknowledge.\n\nShe doesn't want this kid or the responsibility that goes with it. Which from a developmental standpoint and in my opinion, is insanely unethical. Why are you forcing life and existence on a child you don't want? Why are you forcing responsibility you don't want on yourself? Like, either get on board and love this kid and give a shit prepare for it, or put them up for adoption.\n\nIn your shoes,  I think it's fair to take a frustrated and yes, slightly jealous, step (or 10) back from this lady and ask \"wtf are you even doing?\"", "Honestly you could just flat out steal that baby when it's born and STILL be NTA.", "Surely this isn\u2019t real.", "> I am jealous of her\n> Am I the AH for almost hating her and judging her?\n\nThis, right here, makes you the AH.\n\nSo yes, YTA.", "I\u2019m on the fence but I think YTA. This all just reads as jealousy.", "ESH. She suck\u2019s for how she\u2019s handling the pregnancy. You suck for letting it affect you so deeply. Not every pregnancy or baby is a blessing, for a lot of people it\u2019s a nightmare. Stop projecting.", "ESH you can pick pretty much any reason already posted about why YTA, for me mostly it's the jealousy. But let's not let the cousin off the hook for drinking heavily while pregnant. I don't care about the other shit, she can spend her how she likes or whatever but the heavy drinking makes her the asshole too", "YTA. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nIt's not her fault you had a difficult pregnancy.\n\nDon't waste your time and energy being angry at her. No good will come of it, you'll only cause yourself anguish. \nFocus on the family you do have. How she got pregnant and her feelings towards wanting a family have no bearing on you and your family. Focus your attention where it matters.", "ESH - You are entitled to be around whoever you see fit. That doesn't make you an asshole. I think were you are the asshole is the way you look at things----- \"she doesn't realize how lucky she is---- well yes you are on that mind train because you really want a kid and are having a hard time conceiving. But in reality she doesn't think she's lucky at all in fact she's seeing this as unlucky because she never wanted a kid in the first place. Not everyone has that maternal, baby is a miracle mindset and you can't knock someone because they don't view this as an awe inspiring light in their life, and aren't absolutely overjoyed because of it. Would you like for her to tell you that you are lucky because you can't easily conceive or be jealous of you because it? \n\nAnd she sucks because if she is going to to go through with this pregnancy then she should not be drinking. Clearly, that can be detrimental to the child. But honestly, her letting the BF raise the kid might be the least neglectful thing she can do for the child.", "YTA. I have a cousin who had an ovary removed due to cancer and she used to say how there is no way she's having kids and how she never wanted them. Then one day she announced she was pregnant and that she only missed one birth control pill. We all knew that was a lie and suspected she was so adamant about not wanting kids because it would be hard for her to conceive. I suspect she and her husband went through IVF.

That being said idk, there's something about the retelling of these events that seems kind of off..\n\n\nHow much of these comments she's making might be misunderstood dark jokes coming from a person dealing with an unexpected situation they never thought they'd find themselves in. And drinking every single weekend and partying with people who know full well she's pregnant and carrying to term... Are we talking like, a glass of wine here or twelve white claws, because theres a big difference.

Something just seriously doesn't add up here. \n\n\nWith the information presented at face value, ESH. The cousin for what you've described, and you kinda suck too OP. You don't have to be around anyone you don't want to be around for any reason, but if you're asking us to judge your reasoning, yeah it's kinda shitty. I think you and your partner need to see a councilor or couples therapist who works specifically with women or couples in your situation. It's understandable that you might be particularly sensitive towards things relating to children and pregnancy, although I think you're taking things that have absolutely nothing to do with you waaaaaay too personally. The emotions are only going to grow and fester if you keep letting it, until you have no control over your emotions in this situation. Remove yourself from being around her, but if anyone asks for comment, don't try to blame the situation on the cousin.

Other mutual acquaintances have VERY good reasons to dislike this person, I accept their experience with my friend, and I'm not upset they're choosing to actively avoid the person. The way I see it, other people's feelings aren't up to me to question.\n\nWhen it comes to social situations, I personally don't think anyone \"needs to have a reason\" *per se* to NOT want to be in another person's presence. \n\n\"Having a reason\" *does help* when explaining to other perople why you don't want to be around them... but in my perspective, I don't really need to know the reason if someone close to me says, \"I don't feel comfortable being around Lucy in this context,\" I generally accept it.\n\nI can't feel the other person's feelings, so who am I to question their feelings? That's my vibe.", "I understand ( kinda ) how you feel.  I have one child and haven\u2019t been able to have a second.  A couple years ago a relatives 20 yr old daughter was 8 months pregnant, had already had custody of her other two kids taken from her and was shooting up heroin in the bathroom and passing out on the floor in a stupor.  Everyone else turned a blind eye and said there was nothing to be done, it was just a lost cause. I was so sick and jealous and disgusted I couldn\u2019t keep quiet and raised a fuss and was told to leave.  I bawled the rest of the day.  Actually I\u2019m still pretty sick over it.  ( the baby tested positive for opiates in the hospital and was promptly removed from her care, for the record)", "Have you considered adopting her kid?", "I got the feeling she's just putting her in a bad light and lying about the things this cousin does. She's just jealous she's not the one pregnant.", "I would never adopt her child no, as I honestly think a closed adoption away from her and her immediate family would be in the babies best intrest and I have my own child to protect from her and I think she would lash out if we adopted the baby. We already have guardianship of my teenage god child and we co parent with thier bio uncle. I love my god child like my own but to them i am not thier parent which I respect, see me as an aunt and I am happy to be in thier life and support them however they need me to be. We would be open to adopting  however its a long and expensive process and so we wanted to try naturally first.", "Sorry to hear of your struggles, it's heart breaking isn't it? Knowing you want a child more than anything and would love it with all your heart and then there's people who have kids and abuse them....", "Kk. Totally understandable, just wanted to bring it up as you mentioned how much you want more kids. I wish you the best!", "Yes. I grew up abused and only wish to give a child the life I didn\u2019t have. I spoil my dog like she\u2019s my child because I can at least do that much.", "Same. My dad abandoned when I was 3 and my mother had mental health issues and struggled balancing her mental health as a single exhausted parent so became abusive.", "I know exactly how that is. My mother was so messed up she brought me around all kinds of different people that abused me mentally, physically, and sexually and supposedly had no idea any of it was going on. Thank God for my grandma who rescued us kids as soon as she found out.", "NTA.\n\nI don't want kids and I don't want to be around her.", "NTA, I'm childfree and I don't like kids so believe me when I say I don't have a shred of jealousy, that's not a kind of person I'd want to be anywhere near - has she never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome? How awful. I feel sorry for that poor baby that's going to grow up treated as an inconvenience. Disliking children is *not* a reason to want them to suffer.", "If she's drinking while pregnant you need to call CPS.\n\nWhere I'm from FAS is an epidemic. It is just a horrific thing to do to a child and if she is drinking heavily and often CPS can get involved before the baby is born.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even know her, and I hate her.", "NTA but unless she doesn\u2019t have money and is begging others for money while getting her hair and nails done, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nShe is the perfect candidate for forced sterilization. The best thing you can hope for is baby comes (and is healthy despite her disgusting behavior) and is given up for adoption to a good family.", "Unpopular but ESH. She is being somewhat irresponsible with drinking though we don't know how much exactly ( and I'm not entering the debate on alcohol and its acceptability for pregnant people because different countries have different ideas on that), but if it makes you uncomfortable, you don't have to be around her. \nHowever....\nNot everyone thinks a child is a blessing, regardless of what you've been through. I know it's hard to hear right now but for some people, getting pregnant right now would cause them such grief, such pain, such hardship, and you don't get a say. If someone is pregnant and doesn't want to be, that doesn't make them a bad person. She can think whatever she wants about the baby she is carrying, and it sounds like she needs some serious support in coming to terms with the idea that her life has to change. Ever consider that her verbal attitude is out of fear? \n\nYou are viewing her pregnancy through your lens, not hers, and you need to put that method of thinking aside- it will not make her care more about her baby and it will not give you a baby.  You are judging her for wasting money and lack of planning but it doesn't sound like you're close enough to her to make that call- her getting a manicure is literally none of your business and the fact that you include it here is telling.  Her priorities are not yours and if that's not something you care to engage kindly with and with curiosity, then don't be around her.", "YTA. This doesn't mean your cousin isn't obnoxious, but the world does not revolve around one person's fertility, and while you are busy being angry with your cousin you are not focused on the child you do have.  \n\n\nIf you put as much attention on the child you say you love instead of the cousin you say you hate, you'll be a much happier person.", "NTA-possible jealousy aside, she just sounds like an awful person to be around and you are well within your rights to go LC or NC for your own mental health. I\u2019m getting mad just reading her comments, I can\u2019t begin to imagine what it must be like to be around her.", "That's if the baby survive the pregnancy in the first place. Fetal alcohol syndrome is sometimes the best case scenario for babies whose mothers drank while pregnant, as drinking while pregnant can also result in a miscarriage or stillbirth.", "Totally! \n\nI can feel OP trying to be \"polite\" about it, out of respect for other people in her social orbit. And... sometimes, its hard to be polite communicating to others about NOT LIKING SOMEONE for very well-founded reasons.\n\nI think that a lot of people have major problems processing **negative** emotional feedback. Like... collectively we individually WANT to respond positively to others, so much so that it becomes *weird* to hear someone clearly express a negative emotional reaction."]}
