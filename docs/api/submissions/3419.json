They had two children together. Milo who is 8 and Piper who is 7. Elle was diagnosed with cancer 3 years ago and passed away almost a year later. The kids were 5 and 6 years old. My brother met Dani after a few months and began dating her soon after. He and Elle's family had a big falling out because he told them he was hoping Dani would take their mom's place and that they would embrace her as their new mom and he wanted Elle's family to take a backseat so that could happen. They asked how he could erase Elle and he told them she's dead and he and the kids aren't and he didn't want them holding a candle for a dead mother the rest of their lives while they could have a living one. When they told him they loved the kids too much to disappear he told them he could maybe arrange a phone call every Christmas. They decided to take him to court and were granted grandparents visitation as the judge saw it in the best interest of the kids so they would maintain a relationship they already had with their deceased mother's family. My brother and I also had a strained relationship because he also tried to get me to erase Elle.\n\nOnto Dani. She and my brother married a few months ago and hates Elle's family. She has accused them of caring more about themselves and Elle than the kids because they denied them a more whole family. She visibly shows annoyance when the kids mention Elle. She blamed me when the kids told her they weren't going to call her mom (she and my brother asked if they would and the kids weren't interested). She was also unhappy they spent Mother's Day with Elle's family and not her and even told the kids.\n\nNot too long ago she confronted me and said my contact with Elle's family sends the kids the wrong message, and that I clearly have a favorite SIL which isn't fair. I told her Elle was my best friend since we were 4. Her family and I are close and of course we remained close when she married my brother. Dani told me I need to stop seeing them or else. She told me she is tired of being second best and not being chosen by the kids. She said they don't even try to let her in. We argued and I told her that her being jealous and controlling will always make her second best unless she learns to embrace that she did come after Elle in our lives.\n\nShe lost it and my brother told me my loyalty should be with him and Dani over Elle's family. He also told me I was insensitive with Dani.

Sounds like your brother and his family need to go to therapy", "NTA. I hope your brother and his wife wake up to what they are doing to his children. Not only are they guaranteeing these kids a miserable childhood, they are setting themselves up for all sorts of revenge from the children. \n\nWhat a miserable family life for your niece and nephew. And thank goodness you and their mother's family have strong roles in their lives.", "NTA\n\nYoir brotehr and SIL on the contrary...\n\nJesus Christ, I need to stick to Reddit rules otherwise...\n\nPlease, protect those chidren!", "NTA at all.. your brother is a massive AH. \n\nBoth your brother and his wife are ensured that the children will resent them as they grow older.. unfortunately there is nothing much you can do \u2026 your brother does not see that he is causing the unnecessary unhappiness and stress", "NTA, not remotely.  \n\n\nI've seen the result of parents who try to make their kids forget a late parent. The kids go no contact.   \n\n\nFingers crossed your brother realizes his mistake soon, Dani backs off, and the kids are able to get grief counseling because it doesn't sound like dad and his new wifey are going to let them process their grief at home.", "NTA. How can your brother and wife think that erasing their mother from their life will help the children is beyond me. Both the kids and Elle's family are victims in this - I can't believe your brother wanted to cut communication with them. That's just cruel and selfish. You're not an asshole, you're standing up for the children's family", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right in your assessment about new SIL. From the sound of things she doesn\u2019t respect the children at all nor make appropriate efforts to gain their trust and respect; they are 8 and 7 years old not months old and know enough to form their own preferences or judgement so she\u2019s totally not helping her case by being herself. \n\nUnderstandable brother wants to move on with his life but how he goes about it is really wrong, especially for the children. It might be his own way of coping with the loss of his wife but it needs to be corrected before he alienate himself and wife from his own children and family", "NTA, shouldn't this be classed as abuse?  \n\n\nAll you can do is be a good support for them when they inevitably leave home and cut off contact with that shit show of a father.", "Oh wow what a b##ch is your Sil.\nYou always have to help remember the kids of their parent who isn't her anymore.\nIf your that insecure that you can't even do that then something is way wrong.\nHow hard can it be to talk to your kids about their mom and keep a picture of her...\nThe children wil accept her way easier that way.\nYou brother isn't thinking long time because his kids WILL resent him for this I'm sure of it.", "NTA in any way but your brother and SIL are unbelievable", "Sure, because forcing a relationship always works... /s NTA", "You are NTA but do not say stuff like that again, bite your tongue otherwise you will be cut off from the kids and they desperately need their aunt and their mothers best friend. It will only get worse for them not better.", "NTA - Stand your ground. You\u2019re doing the right thing here and told your SIL the truth. You brother and SIL need to consult a child psychologist about their plan to try to erase Elle from the kids\u2019 lives. They are doing more harm to the children than good and the kids will resent them for it. Good for Elle\u2019s family for getting grandparents visitation rights.", "NTA. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to grieve a loved one but trying to forget memories of Elle will likely lead to more guilt long term for your brother. As for the kids, their brains are still developing and dad should be helping them keep happy memories of their mother alive rather than trying to erase them. Thankfully they still have support from you and Elle\u2019s family for that. \n\nOn a side note, your brother\u2019s new wife sounds like Cinderella\u2019s ugly step mother irl, good luck to you all!", "NTA\n\n\nYour brother is trash. Those kids are going to GTFO as soon as they can if he doesn't get his shit together.", "Oh yeah. He and I have not been as close since. He also knows Elle's biggest fear was being replaced and forgotten by the kids and by them putting another mother before her and forgetting/never truly knowing that she loved them so much. She confided in me about it near the end and I know she did to him also and he reassured her it would never happen and then... blah. I can't even say how upset I am with him.", "Except he hasn\u2019t moved on. He\u2019s in denial big time and he\u2019s going to bleed through the Dani-shaped Band-Aid he\u2019s hastily thrown on his grief.", "He would not listen to them. They attempted to speak to him about all this but to no avail.", "I know they want to have children together. Though I'm not sure it would be the end for my nephew and niece because I'm almost sure she would try to use a baby to get close to them and I could see her and my brother making things worse in the long term.", "I do my best. Luckily I am also around when they see Elle's family and I try to keep my presence there even with the arguing so they can talk to me if they need to.", "No, it's not even that. It's all just insecurity because she wants the picture perfect family but you never get that when a loss was had while the children are old enough to remember. And if you're truly a good person who is comfortable in yourself, you never fully get that with them at any age because you make sure they know they were loved by the late parent(s) because you understand that is part of your child(rens) history.", "That's heartbreaking. \n\nIt's a pretty well known fact that children who have lost a parent due to death do far better when that parent is not erased from their lives. Such a feeling of betrayal usually follows when said kids have grown up and end up finding out the truth - especially if they have been systematically kept from birth mother's family. \n\nYour brother only cares about himself. If he valued his children's feelings at all he would not be acting this way.", "I don't know this man well enough to give him the benefit of this line of thinking.\n\nIn general, when someone exhibits so little care for someone who literally fucking died, to the point of telling dead wife's family they can't see his kids, and wanting the kids to forget his ex wife and embrace the new girlfriend as their real mother???\n\nNo, I think saying he is in denial or that this is a band-aid is too much credit for him without any further proof of him deserving that benefit", ">I know they want to have children together. Though I'm not sure it would be the end for my nephew and niece because I'm almost sure she would try to use a baby to get close to them and I could see her and my brother making things worse in the long term.\n\nShe could treat her own children much better to show the kids \"what they are missing by not loving her\" keep an eye on them, the kids could receive a lot of psychological manipulation. And your brother, I don't even know where to start but the family should sit down and talk to him.", "Thank you! This is really important for the kids! My ex husband tried the same as your brother when we split up, he immediately got a new wife, went to court to get more visitation rights and then moved my kid across country to get rid of me. He argued that my kid now had a \"fully functioning family\" with their own kids and family dog, and that I would \"bring stress\" into their lives by wanting to care for my kid. His reasoning was that my kid would miss me less if they just saw me less. The contrary was happening, my kid was miserable, crying all the time and getting super insecure because of the family drama around. I saved up money, moved to the same city across country and fought for 3 years in court until I have my kid now 50:50. The amount of stress that is lifted from their shoulders, the constant grief of not being able to spend enough time with a loved one, is gone. My kid has turned into a bubbly and chaotic wirlwind again and I am so happy I was able to fight the long game.", "NTA If your brother has children with Dani, then you need to make sure she doesn't manipulate using her children. I have a feeling she might play favorites out of spite or use her kids as stooges to corner Elle's kids. She and your brother may actively sow discord between all siblings and make it a nightmare for Elle's kids. You and Elle's family need to prep the kids in advance and establish safe spaces for them. Dani and your brother might even try to force the issue of adoption and hound them for years. Wouldn't be the first time seeing a situation like that in this sub.", "Yeah, it's something we have talked about. He believes the best for them is to not linger on Elle. While I have pointed out that she will always be their mother and has always existed in their lives, she's just not here anymore. But her love for them and their love for her didn't die when she did.", "Hmmm, you\u2019re right. The kids are the ones bleeding through the Band-Aid he\u2019s tried to throw on *their* grief while he acts confused about why they don\u2019t like the actress he cast in the role of mom for the new season.", "I'm sorry, but your brother is coming across as callous. I think he thinks that them moving on would be better and easier because it would be better and easier for him. I'm inclined to think that his desires of wanting the girls to \"move on\" has very little to do with any actual concern for what is best for them.\n\nI could possibly see a parent being concerned that the kid's moving on might be in their best interest - but I can't even give your brother the benefit of the doubt for that based on the language he used to explain it."]}
