Long story short we started flirting and getting intimate in Greece and today she came over for the first time after Holiday.\r  \n\r  \nWe had sex for the first time(which was great for me and her) and we switch to doggy. She makes some comment about how it's her favorite position and I make a stupid joke back about her wanting to do nothing. After that she just got up and told me to leave her alone and not touch her. I tried apologizing, explaining that I was sorry and didn't know she would get upset. She ended up getting dressed and leaving early. I tried to talk but she was quite mad, I asked her to just think about forgiving me. I caught some feeling for her quite fast honestly and I don't want this slight fuck up to be the end of what I see as a potentially great relationship. I absolutely like everything about the girl.\r  \n\r  \nNow I have no idea what to do, I will not text her today and give her some time to relax but I think she overreacted a bit. Of course I didn't tell her that, I tried being as apologetic as I could.\r  \n\r  \nI really like her but I have no idea how to continue after this, after all we are not in a relationship so I fear she just might tell me she's had enough and stop the fun we are having.

The first time you're having sex is a pretty vulnerable time to be criticizing how she has sex.", "YTA here, this is a slight that women get more often than men so you probably don\u2019t see why it\u2019s upsetting for her but good on her for having a boundary and walking out. She probably thinks it\u2019s a red flag for other insults to come. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you can repair the relationship but it\u2019s certainly something you need to tackle with tact.", "So, your first time having sex together and you made offhand insulting comment?\n\nYeah, YTA, and rather dumb, dude", "YTA\n\nIf someone is in front of you on all fours having sex with you, do not criticise them, not as a joke, not in earnest, not at all.\n\nThere are couples (!!!) with a solid relationship and deep trust that can pull something like that off without heard feelings.\n\nThere are people who get off on this (no kinkshaming).\n\nHowever, unless you have cleared one or both of the factors above, it's just degrading. And degrading a woman in bed at her most vulnerable is - sorry to say - an a-hole move.\n\nI feel bad for the both of you because you obviously had no bad intentions. But I might be hard for her to overcome this experience.", "YTA...There's a time and place, and that wasn't it.", "next time simply shut up. i don\u2019t understand what it is with certain people who can\u2019t seem to not say every single thing that comes into their mind. shut up. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI don\u2019t know if anything that could take me from horny to irritated like my partner joking that I\u2019m lazy in bed.", "YTA. Sorry buddy. Here's a pro tip for you: jokes are a great way to make her feel more comfortable, but only if they aren't directed at her.", "YTA. I don't get the joke and why it's funny??Or how it was appropriate to make at that moment???", "It\u2019s generally not a good idea to insinuate your partner is lazy in bed. Even as a joke.", "I think I want to say YTA? How often have you \u201cmade jokes\u201d (at their expense) with sexual partners and it goes well? She may have overreacted, but in the future don\u2019t joke with people you are having sex with unless you are in a relationship and you already know they won\u2019t mind it. A new sexual relationship is not the place for joking around. I don\u2019t really think you had Asshole intentions here, but getting in your hands and knees and having a guy staring at your bum is a very vulnerable thing to do, I wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with you either after you crack a joke at my expense.", "YTA. Even if you didn't truly mean it, the fact that it occured to you at all is what's upsetting. What's worse is that you thought it would be appropriate to say. Now she has to wonder in the back of her mind, any time she asks you for anything in the bedroom, if you're judging her for it. Having sex is a terribly vulnerable thing for a woman, both physically and emotionally, and you implied that you were looking down on her favorite thing during your first time together. That's a huge red flag you just waved. \n\nIt sounds like you didn't really mean to be an asshole but I don't know how you can recover from that so early in a relationship. Say goodbye to any feelings she may have caught for you in return. She probably left so fast because she was about to cry.", "She walked out in the middle of sex because of something you said. That's pretty conclusive evidence that YTA.\n\nWhy are you TA? I'm not sure, but the proof is in her reaction at the time.

You said you caught feelings for her even. Why would you make her the punchline of a joke in the middle of your first time together? \n\nYeah, she might have decided to move on. Time will tell.", "No judgement, just some advice: ask S out on a proper date that won't end in the bedroom eg lunch date out at a nice cafe. You say you really like her. So show her with actions.\n\nJoking during sex is fine once you're an established couple and comfortable with each other. You jumped the gun a bit.", "YTA. What was the point of that comment? You said it was a joke, but if this was the first time you had sex with her and you both don't really know each other well, you really took a chance there. Seems like she got offended, and it took her out of the mood, which I don't blame her for. I don't think she overreacted.. it's an offensive comment. I've been in my relationship for 4 years, and my bf has never said a comment like that to me mid-sex.. what a turn off. You should want to make her feel empowered and sexy.. not shame her for liking a certain position and making assumptions that it's because she has to do \"nothing.\" Oh and as an FYI..You've likely now ruined this position for her, at least for a while..\n\nI agree to give her space and see if she wants to hang out in 2 days. At this point, though, it's up to you if you still want to dismiss her feelings and still think she's overreacting... I would suggest that you  ask her what it made her feel when you said those words so you can understand and avoid this in the future... explain to her your intent wasn't to hurt her and you'll be more mindful in the future..  instead of just saying sorry, try to understand.", "YTA.

Sorry to say it.", "Someone said this to me once and it\u2019s still stuck with me until this day.

Even if it was a joke, she obviously didn't take kindly to it.  Hopefully she comes around. She did definitely overreact. I'm pulling for you on this one, but no more jokes during sex. Lol", "Idk tbh but I feel like you prob should\u2019ve made the joke when you knew each other better sexually, like if this was you\u2019re 100th time I\u2019d be more on you\u2019re side but it was the 1st time.", "NAH. You're not the asshole for saying that and she's nor an asshole for being offended since we don't really know why it hurt it so much.\n\nMaybe try and test the waters banterwise before sex next time to see what type of things you should be saying and what the girl you're with will find funny.\n\nSome girls would find this funny and have a witty comeback, others won't like it at all. People are different and it's all about finding rhw right ones for you.\n\nApologise to her and say it won't happen again and who knows maybe she'll forgive and forget. At least you know that if she does go back not to say anything like that again.\n\nGood luck!", "NAH. You didn\u2019t do anything horrible but her reaction wasn\u2019t unreasonable either.

Part of being in a solid relationship is that you stop over-analyzing everything said and you can just be yourselves. Feisty comments are not insults (clearly your intention was not to insult her during sex). It's just fun, and can spice up the bedroom. It shows you are comfortable with her and you thought you could be yourself, and be spontaneous. You are admittedly not in a committed relationship, but maybe she was hoping you would be by now. \n\nYou apologized, and she won't accept it and get back to your previous status as f-buddies. If she wants more, then she should express it rather than having you guess.\n\nShe's 19, and a newbie about relationships compared to where she will be in 10+ years. She will learn and grow from it, as will you.", "NTA. It was obviously lighthearted and said without malice but sex, especially with someone new, can be an incredibly vulnerable situation that makes some people extra sensitive to perceived insults.

She should have just moved on if you apologized with it. What if she could overreact in the future? Think about that.", "YTA.\n\nNot a joke. You might have just killed w/e it is ya'll had. Time to level up that emotional maturity.\n\nLive and learn I guess.", "It seems like one of those \"not-jokes\" where the person making the \"joke\" believes it but says it in a joking tone", "He's 20 - give him a break - learn your lesson though op, sounds like you're appropriately sorry, just make sure she knows that you are sorry and didn't intend to offend or upset her, but be prepared she might want to stop things with you", "It's funny if the couple has great banter and can be themselves together. Nothing wrong with a little feisty language in the bedroom.  \n\n\nIt wasn't meant as an insult, but because of insecurities, it was taken as an insult. Not his fault. That's on her for taking it the wrong way and then not even accepting his immediate apology once he knew she was upset.", "this is good advice", "Yeah but I can't even think of what message to send that is right. I don't want to apologize again for the tenth time, it will just be annoying.", "What has age got to do with it?

I know the last time we hung out, I ended up ruining the good time we were having. I've apologized a few times, but I'd really appreciate an opportunity to have an in person conversation so we can hopefully talk this through. I've been thinking about what I said and see why it's offensive and was a shitty thing for me to say. I'd really like to hear how it made you feel so I can make sure to learn from this mistake and be more mindful in the future. I've really been enjoying our time together and want to continue getting to know you.\"\n\nIf she does take you up on meeting in person. Do NOT justify your joke/comment.
