My mom would have been my next choice but she does not like attention on her and has mentioned before it would be uncomfortable for her to do. I believed Joe took this well at the time. But a few days ago while he and my mom were visiting, he said I really hurt his feelings. He told me I never had a dad and he never had kids of his own. But he would love for me to be his daughter and to be given the honor that many dad's have been given before. He told me it would signify that he is more than just a husband for my mom and that he is a father figure for me. I told him it was a sweet gesture but that the answer was still no for me. He asked what I would say if he told me he could not come if he was not given the honor and my response that nobody will force him to attend if he does not want to.\n\nI'm not sure if my answer offended him or just hurt his feelings badly.

I always wished I could have known him. She did not date while I was a child. She focused on me. We are very close. As a kid I used to dream of her walking me down the aisle but she was clear it would be uncomfortable for her because of how shy she is. This is how I know about her feelings.

What?? How did your wedding become about Joe?!? \n\nSounds like you have been reasonable & kind. This truly sounds like it just came out of nowhere. Let your Mom deal with Joe. You have said everything you need to. Ball is in his court. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You do not have a father daughter relationship as he started dating your mother after college so his request seems strange.  Also, don\u2019t like that he engaged in emotional blackmail.  Final thought, is he paying for wedding?", "NTA. Joe took a situation that wasn\u2019t about him and then proceeded to make it about him. He wanted to use your wedding to live out a fantasy of him being a father figure to someone. \n\nHim asking isn\u2019t the problem - he asked and you said no, and you weren\u2019t rude. He then turned the emotional manipulation up to 11 to try to get what he wanted. I really can\u2019t see how him saying you spit on him would convince you to change your mind - this was him just trying to hurt you over an imagined slight.", "NTA this man\u2019s behavior is so odd it would make me nervous to be around him.", "NTA.\n\nWhat? The guy who you didn't meet until you were an adult wants to act like a father figure? He's laying the unnecessary guilt on thick. It's only your choice, and for a guy you haven't known that long, that's a huge amount of entitlement. He wasn't a father to you. I'm guessing if they divorced, you'd never speak to him again if you don't have a relationship.\n\nWhatever his deal is, it's not your problem to deal with it.", "NTA. This dude, who *wasn't* a father figure to you, demanded to serve a role in your wedding that he wasn't asked to do, was shocked when you declined, tried to manipulate you, and then rage quit your entire wedding when you said that wasn't how you'd envisioned your own wedding. \n\nThis wasn't about you, wanting to be a father to you, or supporting your marriage in any way. This was about this guy's ego pure and simple.", "NTA: it\u2019s your wedding.. no one is walking you down the aisle. Why is he making this about him? I would understand if you asked someone else (such as soon to be FIL or uncle or whatever) he may be a bit hurt but you\u2019re walking down with your fianc\u00e9. He needs to get over it. It\u2019s not about him.", "NTA- sounds like Joe is real sentimental about a few things missing from his life. It's not your fault and he expressed it in an unhealthy way. Sadly.  \n\nGood luck as weddings bring out weird stuff in people.", "NTA. This man is basically a stranger to you. His delusional expectations aren't your problem. There are red flags waving about the fact he is getting so bent out of shape over this. Firstly, playing the victim. And then throwing a tantrum when he couldn't get his way. You are better off not having him at your wedding. After the before mentioned behavior, there's no telling what shit he might pull at the ceremony/reception.", "NTA this really rubs the wrong way, I'd likely make a point to distance myself from the man in the future", "NTA- he asked and you said no. You weren\u2019t mean. He has no right to feel like he gets to walk you down the aisle and honestly it\u2019s kinda weird he asked and then pushed it. It\u2019s only been a few years.

You have the right to choose, and your logic for saying no seems fair.

He has not earned it. It's really odd.", "NTA  Joe is trying to force a closeness that doesn't exist here.  That's weird.  Even weirder that he's so mad you won't play along with something that would not be genuine.   Your answer was the polite response.   Maybe throwing a I would love for you to be there, would have softened it a bit, but probably not.  Don't worry about it.", "NTA at all. It was unreasonable for him to even ask that. Like, I've never heard of someone asking if they can walk someone else down the aisle. Question always goes in the other direction. Also, you were already an adult when he came into the picture. It makes sense you wouldn't see him in that light.", "NTA. He's asking to make a performative gesture regardless of how you feel. I made an ultimatum and didn't think you'd call his bluff. Things are what they are at this point.", "NTA\n\nOfc as a human male in our society he has probably had the idea of walking his daughter down the aisle in his head since forever... but he is not a father figure to you and it doesn't make sense to pretend otherwise. \n\nFor him to say, \"Well if I don't get this honor I won't come\" shows and proves he's not a father figure! He's not thinking about you, he's only thinking about himself. He's being very selfish with his request, and since it isn't his event he doesn't get to be.", "NTA \n\nI wonder if he's going through some sort of midlife crisis and is seriously regretting not having children.\n\nHim taking this issue out on you is very immature of him. He's not being fair at all.\n\nHave a follow up conversation with your mom to make sure you're on the same page, and she can help him sort his issues out. Definitely not your problem to deal with", "NTA.  My FIL pulled this with his step-daughter\u2026very similar situation only she was in her 20\u2019s when they first met and has an older brother who she asked to walk her down the aisle.  He was furious that her older brother was given that honor as he feels that as the man of the family that should have been given that honor\u2026.\nStay strong. Hopefully this is the only crazy you will experience during your wedding planning.", "NTA\n\nIt is shockingly common for men, good men of outstanding character and excellent personal qualities, to feel entitled to this sort of attention. And they typically get it because they usually seek it from similar men. This has to do with image. Performative.

You don't have this bond with him, and it doesn't seem as if he's really tried to create it. This is neither his nor your fault that you two don't have a father daughter bond because why would you? You were already an adult and out of the house. The fact that he is this mad about something he hasn't earned is kind of a red flag. He's your moms husband, that's it.\n\nEdited to change boyfriend to husband", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding, what a weird power play from stepdad. Why would he think that would go well.", "NTA, like you said he's not a father figure for you.

Uh oh another story of step dads being weird again.", "NTA - being a father figure to you would mean actually taking a fatherly role in your life. Not so needed at 19 but doesn't sound like he made a huge effort to treat you like a daughter before this request.\n\nThe more I think about it I'm actually kind of pissed for you, it's sooo entitled of him to think he deserves this - just because you married a nice lady with a nice daughter doesn't mean you automatically get to have a cute walking down the aisle moment - especially when you didn't raise her! Urgh! Am mad now lmao Joe is definitely the AH.", "NTA. He is waaaaaay out of line. Like did he hit his head recently or something? \n\nYou don't get a parental honor at a wedding if you never acted as a parent, and especially if the one getting married isn't okay with it. \n\nI hope your mom sees this as the red flag it is and properly deals with him. And I hope she doesn't let this ruin a mother daughter wedding experience for either of you.", "The father walking his daughter down the isle is tradition that is deeply rooted in the time when women were still considered the property of their fathers. It basically symbolized the transaction where the woman's ownership changed from the father to the husband. Today, this tradition has luckily more of an emotional significance.

Did your mom have a father figure escort her down the aisle? If so, who was it - and if not, why not? In my mind there\u2019s a few scenarios here that might help clarify his reaction.

To ask in the first place is a bit much. But the audacity to ask several times and then threaten to not attend?  Yikes. I hope he doesn\u2019t so the drama is over. No one wants a stranger to walk them down the aisle.", "NTA....this clown think this wedding  is about  him", "How could he be a father figure to you when you weren't even living under the same roof as adults let alone when you were a child and could have used a father figure.NTA, but let your mum handle this, she needs to establish a boundary with him that shows she is your parent, he is not. She put the hard work into raising you. He did nothing to contribute to your childhood, he is extremely entitled to believe that marrying a single mum gives him father's rights even if her child is already an adult.", "It depends why the question is asked. \n\nIt could be asked in a 'in case you feel you need someone I can do it' way.\n\nObviously after his reaction to the no this was not the case", "NTA", "NTA. It's totally up to you and your fiance to decide what you want to do at your wedding. If you chose to walk in together, I think that's great, I have been to several weddings like that. Joe seems very insecure to me.", "NTA - unfortunately it sounds like you have inadvertently created a monster that is going to attempt to punish you.  It might be a good idea to have a discussion with you mother about making arrangements to make you her medical contact/POA to avoid him trying to prevent you from seeing her should a medical emergency arise", "NTA.  I'm sure it would have been nice if both of them could have walked you down the aisle, but one does and one doesn't, and you only want your mother to do it. He's hurt but that's on him not you", "NTA\n\nThis was a ridiculous request from Joe. It\u2019s the kind of thing that you can ask of a recent stepdad but they can\u2019t ask of you. He\u2019s also trying to make your wedding about him. It\u2019s not your problem he never had kids. It certainly doesn\u2019t give him the right to ask you to pretend that he\u2019s a father figure in your life. Also telling you he wouldn\u2019t go if you didn\u2019t give him that \u201chonor\u201d (not really an honor if you demand it) is manipulative and gross. Everything about his behavior here is just so inappropriate. \n\nAlso you\u2019re walking in with your fianc\u00e9. That\u2019s a great choice! Instead of being given away by a patriarchal figure, you and your partner are entering your marriage together! The symbolism there is so much better.\n\n(No judgment to people who want their dads to give them away, I understand that traditions can be sweet even if their origins aren\u2019t.)\n\n\nUpdate just to add that it\u2019s very telling (and good) that your mom doesn\u2019t understand why Joe is so upset. He\u2019s clearly alone in his delusions here.", "NTA:  an honor is something you earn.  For all intents and purposes he really IS just your moms husband.  He came into her life when you were pretty much grown and out of the house. \n\nIt's your wedding, I don't know why some grown man thinks the day should be about him.  \n\nIf you want to keep the peace I guess maybe have him make a toast?  He seems desperate for validation and attention?", "NTA.\n\nWhile Joe sucks here, I'll try and read into his position.\n\nNot all people are fortunate enough to attract a partner at a younger age, which can get in the way of starting a family sometimes. I think he has an unresolved trauma related to this and he thought he could have 'his family' through you. He is wrong obviously, and I stand by you not being the asshole, but I wonder if Joe might not be alright. If Joe is otherwise a good guy and can get over this current issue, and work on whatever is in the background, maybe you too can still have a good relationship down the line.\n\nI'm a single dad. Mother is still in the picture, we're 50/50. I once dated a girl who was older and therefore missed out on starting a family in her younger years. Told me that, in the long term, if we go the distance, she'd expect to be called mom. Apparently, some step parents get called mom or dad by their kids? Either way, that didn't sit well for me and my situation. My kid has a mom.\n\nI told her that familial titles, if not by blood, are earned. The child is the one to decide who has earned it as well, and it is not something I can enforce. If my child ever feels close to my partner that she wants to call her a second mom, then that is fine. I would never enforce the title though.\n\nWhile you're now an adult, I think this still applies, and is up to your mom to communicate the appropriate boundaries. Talk with her. Hopefully this was just a momentary lapse in judgement on Joe's part.", "NTA\n\nI would understand him offering/asking if it was with your mom so maybe she wouldn't feel that all eyes were on her at the moment they asked who was giving her away or if he said he wanted to do it on her behalf or even if he was offering because he thought you wanted a picture perfect wedding that you see in the movies (you know those people are out there) but the fact he got so worked up over it with our it being any of those reasons is kinda weird so is the fact he didn't run it by your mom before asking the 2nd time since I could see the first time being spontaneous utterance.", "My mom doesn't want to do it. And I don't want Joe.", "You mean OP should play pretend with a grown up man just because he\u2019s sad about something he shouldn\u2019t even be sad about?", "My mom doesn't want to do it. It's too much for her and I don't want him.", "He's not my father though. He's not even my stepdad. He did not parent or raise me or contribute to my life at all. He's my mother's husband. He is a good husband to her but he's not close to me at all.", "But....why does OP need to make him feel included just because he married her mother once she was grown and moved out? He's included in the sense that he's invited, I imagine she's much closer to friends and family members who are also not giving her away.", "No, no cultural context at all.", "Okay, I can see the question as wholesome, from that perspective. Really wish this guy had been so kind.", "No children of his own.", "Most likely he figured that since you don\u2019t have another parental figure to walk you down the aisle he\u2019d get that father of the bride moment he\u2019ll never have. It\u2019s completely unfair to you because the fact is that you don\u2019t see him as a parental figure. Honestly, as someone who had a lot of drama regarding a parents\u2019 partner at my wedding this makes me really angry. He is not entitled to this moment just because he happened to marry your mom.", "He is mad cos you didn\u2019t immediately see him as a father figure, since he is the first man in your mums life for a quite a long time - obviously when they got together you should have bowed down on one knee and thanked him for now being your father /s \n\nNTA - stand by your convictions, it\u2019s your wedding and if you bend now he will expect you to bend to his wants moving forward", "NTA.   \nAs long as he\u2019s not paying for the wedding he doesn\u2019t get to make any requests.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He told me it would signify that he is more than just a husband for my mom and that he is a father figure for me. \" .. HE is NOT MORE than just a husband for your mom. YOU ARE NOT his daughter, he has to respect that.", "NTA. I had a GOOD relationship with my stepdad (I don\u2019t anymore but for unrelated reasons) and he would never in a million years presume he\u2019d be walking me down the aisle.", "NTA\n\nJoe met your mom when you were 19, and married when you were 22.\n\nHe didn't parent you, he was never a parent to you, he IS just the man that your mom married because he didn't raise you at all, you were an adult when they met.\n\nYou have no obligation to this man whatsoever.", "Walk your own self down the aisle.  The whole giving the bride away is a tradition that needs to be in the past.   NTA", "NTA you were an adult when you met Joe. He can be family but he can't be your dad, you just don't have that kind of relationship.", "There is zero possibility that he doesn't have any kids he might be estranged from?\n\nSounds like he views you as some form of surrogate. Typically, men without children don't really care so much about these things.  It would be one thing if he was there during your childhood.", "Do you have any other family? Will you have bridesmaids?\n\nCan you be walked down with a group, is what I'm asking. Bridesmaids and you walk in as usual, then the whole group of close friends, family, and your mum lead you up to your groom. It'd remove the focus from your mum, so she would hopefully be less shy?", "This is just bad advice. You do not have to do something that makes you uncomfortable, on your wedding day or just a normal day, to make someone feel nice. \n\nAnd you don't appear to have been rude in the way you responded to his request. \n\nSometimes peoples feelings will be hurt regardless of what you do, and thats their job to deal with not yours.", "NTA You were very polite about it. My SIL and her husband did it that way because they didn't like the tradition of the woman being handed over as property. You could also mention that idea and say it's not about him.", "You are NTA. But Joe is so incredibly selfish for ruining this for you and your mother, when he has absolutely zero rights to the role. It\u2019s so ridiculous that I assume this selfishness bleeds over to other things.", "NTA but Joe is delusional", "Who is paying for the wedding and expenses related to the wedding ?", "Have you asked your mom if she knows where this is coming from?  Given that he NEVER played a father role in your life, never lived with you, never supported you financially or emotionally ... why does he feel this way?\n\nIf a future relationship is important to you, then its worth spending the time finding out where these strange feelings are coming from.  Does he have friends teasing him?  Does he not know how to say to his friends \"oh no, she was actually an adult before I married her mom, so I didn't fill the father role for her\"?\n\nIts an awkward and uncomfortable situation, but looking toward the future, and having your mother be comfortable with the 2 people she loves most, its worth going to the effort of finding out why he thinks he deserves father honours.  Discussing it with sensitivity.\n\nIf it helps, think of him as an upset business associate.  Take the emotion (in your brain) out of it, and work on it as if its an important business relationship, and you have an emotional business partner you need to sooth.\n\nNTA", "NTA he's barely known you wtf", "What he's struggling with is that he can't understand that one you're an adult, becoming a father figure is almost impossible. Even an adopted father figure (in-laws) takes years of bonding to establish. \n\nI'm not sure why he's making this hill one to die on. With this degree of frustration, I'm hoping there's something more there than some archaic traditional beliefs. But regardless, none of it matters to you. Whatever it is is a *him* problem. He is little more than a close stranger to you. He's not entitled to anything, much less at your wedding."]}
