They got married when I was 22. I am now 26 and I am getting married. Joe is an okay guy. I have no issues with him. But I can't say we're close either. I have spent some time with him but between college, working, living my own life and not living in the same state as him and my mom, I haven't grown particularly close to him. Which is why when he asked to walk me down the aisle at my wedding I said no. I chose to walk with my fianc\u00e9 because it felt right. My mom would have been my next choice but she does not like attention on her and has mentioned before it would be uncomfortable for her to do. I believed Joe took this well at the time. But a few days ago while he and my mom were visiting, he said I really hurt his feelings. He told me I never had a dad and he never had kids of his own. But he would love for me to be his daughter and to be given the honor that many dad's have been given before. He told me it would signify that he is more than just a husband for my mom and that he is a father figure for me. I told him it was a sweet gesture but that the answer was still no for me. He asked what I would say if he told me he could not come if he was not given the honor and my response that nobody will force him to attend if he does not want to.\n\nI'm not sure if my answer offended him or just hurt his feelings badly. He said I had made my feelings clear and he would not let me spit on him anymore. My mom told me he was clearly seething and she had no idea why he was so upset.\n\nBG for anyone who needs more info: My dad died when mom was pregnant with me. They were married. It broke her heart. I always wished I could have known him. She did not date while I was a child. She focused on me. We are very close. As a kid I used to dream of her walking me down the aisle but she was clear it would be uncomfortable for her because of how shy she is. This is how I know about her feelings. She only started dating after I moved out for college and she met Joe after dating around a bit. She seems very happy and I am so happy for her. My mom is amazing and is very special to me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681490810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m3exl/aita_for_telling_my_moms_husband_nobody_will/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What?? How did your wedding become about Joe?!? \n\nSounds like you have been reasonable & kind. This truly sounds like it just came out of nowhere. Let your Mom deal with Joe. You have said everything you need to. Ball is in his court. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You do not have a father daughter relationship as he started dating your mother after college so his request seems strange.  Also, don\u2019t like that he engaged in emotional blackmail.  Final thought, is he paying for wedding?", "NTA. Joe took a situation that wasn\u2019t about him and then proceeded to make it about him. He wanted to use your wedding to live out a fantasy of him being a father figure to someone. \n\nHim asking isn\u2019t the problem - he asked and you said no, and you weren\u2019t rude. He then turned the emotional manipulation up to 11 to try to get what he wanted. I really can\u2019t see how him saying you spit on him would convince you to change your mind - this was him just trying to hurt you over an imagined slight.", "NTA this man\u2019s behavior is so odd it would make me nervous to be around him.", "NTA.\n\nWhat? The guy who you didn't meet until you were an adult wants to act like a father figure? He's laying the unnecessary guilt on thick. It's only your choice, and for a guy you haven't known that long, that's a huge amount of entitlement. He wasn't a father to you. I'm guessing if they divorced, you'd never speak to him again if you don't have a relationship.\n\nWhatever his deal is, it's not your problem to deal with it.", "NTA. This dude, who *wasn't* a father figure to you, demanded to serve a role in your wedding that he wasn't asked to do, was shocked when you declined, tried to manipulate you, and then rage quit your entire wedding when you said that wasn't how you'd envisioned your own wedding. \n\nThis wasn't about you, wanting to be a father to you, or supporting your marriage in any way. This was about this guy's ego pure and simple.", "NTA: it\u2019s your wedding.. no one is walking you down the aisle. Why is he making this about him? I would understand if you asked someone else (such as soon to be FIL or uncle or whatever) he may be a bit hurt but you\u2019re walking down with your fianc\u00e9. He needs to get over it. It\u2019s not about him.", "NTA- sounds like Joe is real sentimental about a few things missing from his life. It's not your fault and he expressed it in an unhealthy way. Sadly.  \n\nGood luck as weddings bring out weird stuff in people.", "NTA. This man is basically a stranger to you. His delusional expectations aren't your problem. There are red flags waving about the fact he is getting so bent out of shape over this. Firstly, playing the victim. And then throwing a tantrum when he couldn't get his way. You are better off not having him at your wedding. After the before mentioned behavior, there's no telling what shit he might pull at the ceremony/reception.", "NTA this really rubs the wrong way, I'd likely make a point to distance myself from the man in the future", "NTA- he asked and you said no. You weren\u2019t mean. He has no right to feel like he gets to walk you down the aisle and honestly it\u2019s kinda weird he asked and then pushed it. It\u2019s only been a few years. You were an adult when they met, he didn\u2019t raise you or do anything a father does", "NTA it is your wedding at the end of the day, and by pushing the idea on you he forced you into a corner which made you say something that upset him and then he gave you an ultimatum that backfired. \n\nwhich isn\u2019t very fatherly of him lol \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You have the right to choose, and your logic for saying no seems fair. If he wasn't putting up these ultimatums I would say offer him a chance to fill that role as a father figure & you'll try and get to know him better in the future, but definitely not now, so if he is going to blackmail you into doing it now it's a off the table.\n\n Huge red flags from him, if he can't back off these ultimatums starting right now, it's a no go.", "NTA It's an earned privilege. He has not earned it. It's really odd.", "NTA  Joe is trying to force a closeness that doesn't exist here.  That's weird.  Even weirder that he's so mad you won't play along with something that would not be genuine.   Your answer was the polite response.   Maybe throwing a I would love for you to be there, would have softened it a bit, but probably not.  Don't worry about it.", "NTA at all. It was unreasonable for him to even ask that. Like, I've never heard of someone asking if they can walk someone else down the aisle. Question always goes in the other direction. Also, you were already an adult when he came into the picture. It makes sense you wouldn't see him in that light.", "NTA. He's asking to make a performative gesture regardless of how you feel. I made an ultimatum and didn't think you'd call his bluff. Things are what they are at this point.", "NTA\n\nOfc as a human male in our society he has probably had the idea of walking his daughter down the aisle in his head since forever... but he is not a father figure to you and it doesn't make sense to pretend otherwise. \n\nFor him to say, \"Well if I don't get this honor I won't come\" shows and proves he's not a father figure! He's not thinking about you, he's only thinking about himself. He's being very selfish with his request, and since it isn't his event he doesn't get to be.", "NTA \n\nI wonder if he's going through some sort of midlife crisis and is seriously regretting not having children.\n\nHim taking this issue out on you is very immature of him. He's not being fair at all.\n\nHave a follow up conversation with your mom to make sure you're on the same page, and she can help him sort his issues out. Definitely not your problem to deal with", "NTA.  My FIL pulled this with his step-daughter\u2026very similar situation only she was in her 20\u2019s when they first met and has an older brother who she asked to walk her down the aisle.  He was furious that her older brother was given that honor as he feels that as the man of the family that should have been given that honor\u2026.\nStay strong. Hopefully this is the only crazy you will experience during your wedding planning.", "NTA\n\nIt is shockingly common for men, good men of outstanding character and excellent personal qualities, to feel entitled to this sort of attention. And they typically get it because they usually seek it from similar men. This has to do with image. Performative. He thinks he\u2019s supposed to walk you down the aisle because that\u2019s what guys like him do.\n\nETA I am guessing he\u2019s a decent guy if your mom married him.", "NTA. You don't have this bond with him, and it doesn't seem as if he's really tried to create it. This is neither his nor your fault that you two don't have a father daughter bond because why would you? You were already an adult and out of the house. The fact that he is this mad about something he hasn't earned is kind of a red flag. He's your moms husband, that's it.\n\nEdited to change boyfriend to husband", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding, what a weird power play from stepdad. Why would he think that would go well.", "NTA, like you said he's not a father figure for you. If he wants to do something meaningful he could support your decisions regarding your wedding.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t use your wedding to let joe live out his fantasy of walking someone down the aisle.", "NTA. Uh oh another story of step dads being weird again.", "NTA - being a father figure to you would mean actually taking a fatherly role in your life. Not so needed at 19 but doesn't sound like he made a huge effort to treat you like a daughter before this request.\n\nThe more I think about it I'm actually kind of pissed for you, it's sooo entitled of him to think he deserves this - just because you married a nice lady with a nice daughter doesn't mean you automatically get to have a cute walking down the aisle moment - especially when you didn't raise her! Urgh! Am mad now lmao Joe is definitely the AH.", "NTA. He is waaaaaay out of line. Like did he hit his head recently or something? \n\nYou don't get a parental honor at a wedding if you never acted as a parent, and especially if the one getting married isn't okay with it. \n\nI hope your mom sees this as the red flag it is and properly deals with him. And I hope she doesn't let this ruin a mother daughter wedding experience for either of you.", "The father walking his daughter down the isle is tradition that is deeply rooted in the time when women were still considered the property of their fathers. It basically symbolized the transaction where the woman's ownership changed from the father to the husband. Today, this tradition has luckily more of an emotional significance. With there being no emotional connection between Joe and you, I think it's pretty weird, however that he is so focused on fulfilling this role or even feels somewhat entiteled to it.\n\nNTA", "Dude feels entitled to the honor of \u201cfather figure\u201d when he isn\u2019t one?!? This is your Mom\u2019s problem now. Nta", "nta he's entitled", "NTA - this man is not your father or your step father, he\u2019s your moms husband. You have no relationship with him, and he wants to be able to cosplay as a dad on your wedding day despite the fact that he\u2019s not one.", "NTA - You\n\nAH - Joe", "NTA, this is your day, you get to pick all the things.", "NTA\n\nHe had 6 years to form a relationship and get to the point to earn that honor. It is just misguided for him to think he can just expect it to pop up out of the blue.", "Maybe a compromise? When they ask who gives this Bride away, he can approach the groom and give a man to mam handshake. Maybe even a forehead kiss for you. Only because weddings are a time for all family members to feel involved, and I get why you don't want him to walk you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why would he walk you down the aisle. \nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding", "NTA Just because he is married to your mom doesn't make him your father. He wasn't even around why you were growing up. There are many mom's who would walk their child down the aisle but that is her choice not to and you are respecting that.

Also, keep an eye on your mom. If he's this demanding and manipulative with you, he may be way worse with her. If she's shy, she may be hesitant to stand up to him.

Him asking is strange but what pushes this to he\u2019s the AH is his reaction. \n\nNot that his reasoning matters much but is it possible he feels a stronger connection to you than what there really is due to your mom talking about you? You stated you and your mom are really close so she probably talks about you and shares memories with him quite. Maybe it\u2019s an explanation of why he asked in the first place but does not excuse the behavior that followed.", "NTA  for the sake of family peace it would be nice if you could find out what's joe's issue but he's not a father figure. you were a grown women when he came into your life.", "You were literally an adult when he met you. He was no involved in raising you at all. Hold your ground NTA\n\nAlso a bride walking down the aisle alone is a stunning sight as well!", "NTA you were already an adult when he entered your mom's life. You never lived with him, you don't have a close bond with him. Why does he even think that there could be a possibility of having a fatherly role in your wedding?\n\nI really hope that you will tell your mother about this and that she will be able to tell him how inappropriate his behaviour is.", "NTA. Someone tell him he\u2019s not ready to fill a fatherly role if he isn\u2019t ready to listen to your needs and let you walk yourself down the isle.", "NTA\n\nHonestly this comes off like Joe just had a bucket list item of \"walking daughter down the aisle\" but had no daughter so he latched on to you as his best option. I don't believe all the emotional stuff he is pulling either, I think it's all a big show of his manliness or pride and he is frustrated that you aren't going along with it.", "NTA\n\nThere was nothing wrong about initial ask, although it would have been better framed as something along the lines of \"hey, if you would like me to walk you down, I am open to doing so for you\".\n\nHe had no business continuing to pressure you, especially given that he had absolutely no hand in raising you or probably even having a chance to help you with anything.\n\nIf you get involved with someone after their kids are already adults and moved out, frankly the step parent title doesn't really apply... Your just mom's husband or dad's wife. \n\n Unless you prove yourself to be a good grandparent or something.  Then you might get to earn the title after the fact.", "NTA first off- your mom sounds amazing! What a blessing to have a parent so focused on giving you the best life \ud83d\udc99 the fact her husband is acting like this isn't fair to you OR her (since she raised you without a dad) I'm sorry this is happening", "NTA, my dad was my 1st choice to walk me down the aisle, but he died while I was an adult, and before I met the person who is my partner. If my mom does remarry, which my bro and I support. Her new partner will not walk me down the aisle. I've asked her if she would, and that's an honor she would like. It sounds like you've been respectful of the fact that she has a partner who makes her happy but that doesn't mean that you have to give them the role of \"dad\" at your wedding when they've never had that role. You're good and I hope you have a wonderful wedding and a happy life.", "Nta it\u2019s your wedding and you can cry if you want to, cry if you want to\u2026.", "That shocked me too.

I would find it weird to ask someone I don't know that well to pay for my wedding or to allow him to.", "Yep! OP was very polite and her reasoning was very valid. Not to mention, no matter what she gets the choice of who/if anyone walks her down the aisle. It\u2019s ridiculous for him to be throwing this much of a fit over this when he clearly doesn\u2019t even have a father/ daughter relationship with her. Probably best he doesn\u2019t attend at this point.", "This was my immediate reaction too- something is not right here", "I don't really know and what makes it worse is he's not my parent or a father figure for me. We have not spent nearly enough time to be close. Yet he doesn't just bring it up one time but twice. It's weird to me.", "Well he'd certainly feel entitled to make a speech as well...", "I'm just not close enough for him to fill in for something like that. And after the way he reacted to me I don't want him to have a role. If anyone was deserving of doing something like that it would be my mom because I am her daughter.", "I disagree. Wedding absolutely are not about all family members feeling involved. Wedding are about the bride and groom having the people they feel close to their celebrating them.", "Not even stepdad he\u2019s just moms husband", "Maybe it\u2019s just something he\u2019s always wanted to experience??? ... & he believes you\u2019re his only opportunity to do that. That\u2019s definitely not your issue.... ugh sorry for you & your poor Mom. Joe is going to have to figure this one out on his own.", "Oof. Definitely NTA. I thought this a rather strange request on his part considering the circumstances and I was also wondering if he was helping to pay for the wedding. It would still be a NTA vote for me either way, but I was really trying to figure out his logic on this from his perspective.", "Maybe this was a fantasy for him and you've essentially told him he can't go to Disneyland.\n\nHe probably imagined he'd be giving a speech as well.\n\nNTA", "I think it has to do with proving a point to your family and your in-laws etc (and guests) that you guys are close. - potentially it\u2019s something hes wanted to do but can\u2019t because him and your mother won\u2019t have children due to xyz. \n\nIt\u2019s basically him pushing his wishes onto you because of his own insecurities. \u2014 however, it\u2019s still your day", "It's your wedding and vision. I can dig it! All blessings to you and your future spouse.", "That's what I'm thinking... and like maybe out of the times OP was spent time with Joe, he just thought more of the relationship than OP clearly had. Just hope he didn't go around telling all his people about it with all the enamored sentiments. I kinda feel bad for him because his seething was akin to a broken heart, but that's not on OP. I do hope he can sort it out for himself."]}
