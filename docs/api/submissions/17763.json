There's not that many options near me, only a home-owned tailor and a local suit shop.

He put me in a waistcoat and jacket off the rack and took out his measuring tape. He hastily finished and gave me a slip of paper with the info. He asked me to donate to a cancer charity instead of paying for the measurements.  \nI walked out feeling very confused and conflicted. I never intended to be rude or cheeky.

If you were upfront about your intentions and willing to pay for the service, what is the problem? He can always say no.", "I'll be honest that I don't know much about suit tailoring, but going into a tailoring shop without any garments to actually tailor...Definitely makes sense they turned you away.\n\nI always assumed the measurements taken at a suit shop were directly linked to the purchase of a suit that you would have tailored through them. I've never heard of walk-in measurements without purchase, as it is a waste of employees' time with no earned commission or sale.\n\nI know you were willing to pay for it, but it likely wasn't something they really do/have a charge for.\n\nNAH I guess", "NTA, because you were upfront and honest, and offered to pay.", "NTA.  The associate agreed otherwise you would not have shown up. How were you to know it would end this way? Those saying this is \u201ctacky\u201d are ignoring the fact that you\u2019ve done this previously in other places.", "YTA I did an apprenticeship in my much younger years at a custom suit shop. This was not a service that we offered, payment or not. Why should we provide you with all of the measurements needed to buy a suit someplace else? Not to mention the fit of suiting can greatly vary from place to place. The measurements we take as a custom shop may not translate to how an off the rack trim fit suit will fit. We did this once and that exact scenario happened and the guy came back furious saying we didn\u2019t know what we were doing. Ummmm you asked us to size you up for an off the rack suit, after we warned you that this may not work and sure as shit, it didn\u2019t. Who needs their good names tarnished due to another companies work and a clients pure ignorance.", "NTA.  The level of service available in the US is not mirrored in the rest of the world.

I assume that Australia is on the metric system. \n\n3.

It\u2019s an included service in the purchasing process. \n\nI\u2019ll give you some credit it for offering to pay for it, but it sounds like the associate agreed to something they shouldn\u2019t have. And because of that, the employee shouldn\u2019t have been grumpy with you over it. He should explaining politely and then getting annoyed at staff. \n\nI hope you do donate to charity.

Did you call them multiple times, go there multiple times? What happened?", "YTA but that\u2019s because I think you have a fetish for getting your measurements taken. I\u2019m 41 with multiple bespoke suits and I have never gone into a tailor shop and got my measurements taken without the intention of buying a suit yet you have apparently multiple times over the years just walked into a tailor shop and had it done with no intention of buying or renting? Is this a sex thing?", "YTA for sure. Most places won't do measurements without a sale and the owner told you no once and like a stubborn jack ass or child ( who asks mommy who says no, so then runs to daddy to ask) you show up anyways and are confused when there was attitude. If you were ANYWHERE else in the world other then fhe UK you would have been told to GTFO AND DONT COME BACK. You're lucky yhe British are exceedingly \"polite\".

The joke was likely written in the 50s or 60s, so make of that what you will:\n\nA woman walks into a clothing shop and asks for three outfits suitable for international travel. An alert saleswoman offers to assist her and helps with selecting three full outfits, complete with hats, shoes, gloves and other accessories.  \n\nAfter spending a couple hours with this, the customer politely thanks the woman and says, \u201cthis is just the kind of attire I want if my husband ever lets me go to Europe.\u201d", "As devils advocate, I could see the shop assistant thinking you\u2019re taking an appointment from someone who would be buying a suit from them and therefore spend more money than they would make on just taking your measurements.  That said, I don\u2019t think that gives him the right to be rude to you.

Maybe women's focused shops have more incentive due to more frequent tailoring needed, but I've definitely just gotten measured at a shop near me, but it's also the one I go to if I need any sort of tailoring done, so I've worked with them a good chunk since. Super nice shop that does good work. I don't frequently need fancy dresses, but hemming is a different story. There's typically an understanding that someone involved in a wedding doesn't really always have control where the clothes come from.\n\nIf they had an issue, they should have said something when OP called.

The associate said they would do it free of charge. How is OP possibly TA?", "It might be tacky if you got measured in one store and bought the suit in another store in the same city.

The store should be understanding and take the measurements (just a few minutes work) as a gesture of good will so that OP will come back the next time he needs something.", "But you *are* buying something here, if you offer to pay for the measuring service. It's not like he went in and got a free suit measurement without any intention of buying a suit. \n\nHe offered money to only do the measuring service and was upfront that's all he wanted. It's out of the ordinary but it's pretty much free money.
