Was worried that it's indeed me who was in the wrong as some days I do feel rather good and could do some work on others I feel sh***.  Going to work on days I feel good would also mean I cannot spend that time to still  do some \"normal things\" with my kids.

Our HR is the owner of the company so I'm not 100% sure but I guess she s somewhere hoping I give in to my colleague and get to work as it would save her loads of money so I'm afraid to bring it up to her and she would agree that I'm giving them too much trouble :)", "Um, I am assuming this is a joke.
