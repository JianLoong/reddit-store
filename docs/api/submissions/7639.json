I told everyone I was ok and was happy to wait since I was enjoying chatting with the server and was getting up the nerve to ask him if he had a girlfriend. I continued to snack on the nachos. \n\nAfter an hour people started to show up and nachos were gone. Andrea got there last and asked what happened to the nachos. I very casually said I ate them. She looked at me in shock and said \u201cthose were for the table, they were $35.\u201d I said I was sorry but they were getting cold and I was the only one there and I said thank you and I would pay for them. She said she already put them on her credit card when she called. I said I would gladly buy her drinks.

Andrea got really upset again and said she wasn\u2019t going to sit here and take this and got up walked out. I was in shock because I felt like even I shouldn\u2019t have eaten the nachos, I did try to make up for it.\n\nAndrea went on a tirade in the text while the rest of us were trying to eat.

That seems odd", "NTA. You could have left versus wait an hour for everyone. The nachos would have been cold and gross after an hour so no one would eat them and Andrea would still complain. Andrea didn't have to announce her pregnancy like that, so she ruined her announcement, not you. You could have offered to order another plate and pay for them instead of drinks, but she also could have said \"I was really looking forward to the nachos, not drinks\" in place of her saying she was pregnant. \n\nThe really AH here is a restaurant that charges $35 for nachos...", "NTA.

It's incredibly rude to run an hour late when a meal is planned (not just to you, but to the restaurant as well - they reserved a table for a certain time and were shown zero respect).  \n\nAndrea's gesture of ordering the nachos was very nice, but her reaction to finding them gone an hour later was not. It was appropriate of you to offer to pay (which you did) and your offer to buy drinks was perfectly fair.

NTA-\n1) you didn\u2019t do anything wrong (ordering something by calling the restaurant-when you\u2019re not even there-definitely implies that it\u2019s specifically for the people who ARE there, and it sounds like you were waiting for at least 30 min) \n2) you offered to make amends (that were actually unnecessary since you didn\u2019t do anything wrong) \n3) she wasn\u2019t forced into making her announcement. No, thank you would have sufficed. \n\nMy guess is that her hormones are off. Let it go. You\u2019ve already apologized and tried to make amends. Don\u2019t bring it up again.

They would've been inedible by the time anyone else showed up.\n\nAlso, why was everyone an hour late to a restaurant? Like tbh, speaking as a server, that's really fucking annoying, because it means that table couldn't be used for anyone else for *hours*. If this happened at my workplace, my coworkers would probably be trying to move you to a smaller table so they could seat more people. Because it messes up the whole night when you've got customers asking why they can't have that table, you've got the owner asking why the customers can't have that table, and if you're an American server it's cutting off part of your income.\n\nJust saying, they better have had a *really* good reason.

You'd been waiting or an hour, had to keep yourself busy. As for her, probably the hormones doing their work.", "NTA but pregnancy hormones are no joke. Hopefully this will pass but now her pregnancy announcement is marred by this incident, as irrational as it is, and that will forever be the story of how she told her friends she was having a baby. Maybe you can flip it into a funny story about how you sat there for an hour mindlessly eating the congealing nachos trying to get a server's number. Curious about the size of these nachos though. $10 nachos by me are huge, way too big for 1. $35 nachos sounds like a cookie sheet piled high with several meats.\n\nEdit for spelling error", "NAH\n\nYou were hungry, you ate the nachos.

Hope you have a better day!\u201d", "ESH - them for running super late but you should have either ordered more nachos for the table or venmo\u2019d Andrea the $35 since she basically paid for you dinner (since you only ate nachos and didn\u2019t get an entree).", "NTA. Andrea is pregnant and her hormones are all out of whack, I\u2019d chalk it up to that. There wasn\u2019t any clear communication about the damn nachos she seems so upset about and you did offer to buy her drinks, even if she couldn\u2019t drink. You\u2019re not a mind reader and that seems to be what she\u2019s wants. She announced her own pregnancy news unprompted, so that\u2019s also on her.", "Both of you were a-holes, but Andrea was worse, Pregnancy hormones or not, she made an ass of herself, but so did you.  You were okay to eat the whole plate of nachos because everyone was late, and yes, they were getting cold, but how could you have remedied this situation so you didn't become the asshole?  As soon as you realized you ate the whole plate, or nearly all of it, you should have ordered another.  I do NOT understand why this logic escaped you, and it should not have, so that makes you an a-hole.", "ESH\n\nI was about to say NTA, until I put myself in your scenario as I would imagine a portion of $35 nachos would be absolutely massive and will have taken a while to finish by yourself.\n\nI'm also assuming that this was a restaurant setting?  If so I would've also expected to have dinner with everyone else, therefore would have saved myself to spend time with my friends.\n\nIf you had space for the Nachos and dinner, then you should've dropped a message halfway through to thank them for the food and to say if you don't hurry up you'll finish it.", "ESH, them for running super late and expecting there to be nachos with cold cheese, smh!

You may have found an exception, though!", "People were supposed to be on their way already an hour ago, I would not order anything until I actually see their faces in the restaurant.", "That too.", "LOL.", "She tried half-heartedly, after-the-fact.  She had a play-by-play on her phone of when everyone was arriving.  Waiting for the host to arrive and ask her how to fix the problem was unnecessary.  She should have ordered the replacement nachos so they would be there when the group arrived.  That is a no-brainer.", "Don't get me wrong, but the original purpose was to celebrate a friend's birthday over dinner right?\n\nIt wouldn't be much celebrating if you've eaten yourself full and just watching everyone else eat their meal awkwardly.", "OP should have just sent her the money and be done with it.", "Seriously. OP stuck around when they didn't have to...and now Andrea is giving OP attitude?!", "In 12 years, the only thing my dig has eaten when I left the room was a ham and cheese hot pocket. That had to hurt because it was just out of the microwave. So, this woman is worse than my dog! \n\nLol\n\nJust kidding of course. Her pregnant friend is being an asshole. Maybe she is just having a bad day. Not saying she is an asshole... just acting like one over some nachos that she wasn't planning on eating anyways.\n\n\nPlus... fuck people who ate late. Grow up.", "Nachos aren't good even ten minutes later. They become a congealed pile of disappointment as soon as they're no longer piping hot.", "Yeah if I guy my age (28) asks or wants to exchange snaps, it\u2019s an\nInstant no. I think this server was like 23-24 so maybe that\u2019s a thing guys his age do? He is a semi-pro baseball player though\u2026so he had a lot going for him and oh my god was he cute. I may get past the snap thing. Not sure.", "Is a guy asking/giving a snap a sign he just wants to hook up? I\u2019m in my 40s so guys my age don\u2019t even use social media. But I always see this issue and was curious.", "I never considered that, it didn\u2019t click to me that guys would use Snapchat to cheat but that makes so much sense", "Because it was all about *her*. \n\nShe was going to make it an announcement \"thing\", and she had it all story-boarded in her head.\n\nThen, plans went awry, but she didn't update the story to reflect that, and lashed out because someone went off script.\n\nShe sounds exhausting.\n\nGet the server's number, and move on.\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s why I have a fleet of children running on hamster wheels powering my house.", "I don\u2019t see it as a fair trade. $35 is a lot and was meant to be shared.  OP didn\u2019t even order a meal because they filled up on someone else\u2019s dime. A $2 soft drink isn\u2019t repayment.", "It was the reason I couldn\u2019t pay her back by buying her margaritas. But I also think she was trying to jab a proverbial knife in me", "With a whole group of people already late an hour, I would not order anything for them until they are actually in the restaurant.", "Yeah but tbh I\u2019d be pissed I had to wait an hour for everyone and nachos would have gone grim if you\u2019d left them that long anyway, she should have accepted the money", "Even tho the chick rejected the money??", "Really? I'm 31 and just started talking to a 42-year-old woman who encouraged me to get snapchat lol. She said it's easier to send photos and videos on snapchat vs text because she has an iphone and I have an android. And it is.", "Ooh yeah the baseball thing, been there lol It's a draw for sure, especially in the uniforms lol", "My husband of 12 years is 4 years younger than me. Don't let this deter you! You are both overage!", "You were up tossing and turning all night about a fight over nachos, are asking strangers to weigh in on the fight, are judging a guy based on not talking to strangers the same way you do, are considering him a cheater for it, and rejecting him for an age he may or may not be--it sounds like you overthink things a lot.  \n\nApologize to the friend over text that the night didn't go how she planned, congratulate her on the baby, venmo her for the nachos (don't ask, just do it), and message the cute baseball player.  Life's too short for the little things.\n\nNTA", "No. Not at all. But in my experience those that use snap as their only method of contacting you are usually doing so because they're talking to multiple people and maybe don't want others to know. Best case scenario they really enjoy sending daily pics and chatting. Worse case scenario he has a girlfriend and is hiding messages, lol. Snapchat has disappearing messages.\n\nMaybe the hookup thing could be an issue for others but no one that ever asked for mine was that bold.", "This is how I know I'm too old. When you initially said \"snap\" I had no idea what that was until you said the whole name in this followup comment.", "It\u2019s possible, but it shouldn\u2019t be assumed, it\u2019s much more likely that he wasn\u2019t.", "That\u2019s potentially unfair - we\u2019d never say that if you were a guy and the waiter was female. It\u2019s a way to contact him that\u2019s easier to stop / block if either of you want.", "Lucky you! My three kids just drain my energy and wallet. But my bestie just got engaged to a man 10 years younger than her and he is in his 30s she could not be happier with the age gap bedroom match...just saying. Having the guy younger has its advantages", "But my husband is 6 years older than me and that also has some distinct advantages as well so take my advice with a grain of salt", "She offered to pay for it and pregnant lady said no. If OP hadn\u2019t eaten it, then it\u2019s STILL $35 down the drain because they would have been cold and soggy after an hour and nobody would touch them anyway. And in that instance, OP wouldn\u2019t even have offered to pay for it. Pregnant lady could have been reimbursed but chose to sulk instead.", "I don't even think OP needs to pay anyone back. Even if no one else was late, the nachos would have either been eaten by her friends or gone cold and nasty. If you want some of the nachos, don't order them a whole hour before you'll be there.", "Op offered to pay for it\u2026 NTA. Me, I wouldn\u2019t have waited an hour. If I did wait an hour, I\u2019d have \u201cboredom nibbled\u201d all of those nachos. Who are these magical people who would have just let the nachos sit there for an hour? And if I ordered nachos for a table for the HOUR I was going to be late, I would be unsurprised to find them gone after that hour whether there was one person at the table or six\u2026", "OP was assuming alcoholic drinks.  No one knew she was pregnant until after OP offered to.pay for her drinks.  Alcoholic drinks are way more than $2 at a restaurant that charges $35 for a plate of nachos, could be as much as $15 for a margarita and other cocktails.", "I\u2019ve been around for 2 pregnancies and seen my wife politely decline drinks without bringing up the pregnancy. Your friend was 100% weaponizing her pregnancy. You did nothing wrong.", "She could have easily said \"how about just ordering more nachos for the table now instead?\" Or \"you can Venmo me later it's ok\" or \"maybe buy my entree instead\" or \"well we can figure it out another time\" like it's not like you said \"well I'll only pay for margaritas but nothing else\"", "This isn't an accusation or anything, I think you're NTA, but why didn't you just offer to get another plate of nachos for the table? Like a 1:1 replacement instead of drinks?", "Nah there was still no reason to mention the pregnancy.\n\nA simple \"not planning on drinking tonight\" would suffice. She used it to make you feel worse.", "That's exactly why I put ESH.\n\nOP could've given a heads up and the friend also should have accepted the money.", "Yes, just send her the payment even after the night was over.", "Instagram does the exact same thing. Lol. No reason to get Snapchat if you don't already have it. That's like 10+ years out of date.", "Oh yeah; I thought he was just putting me on but he showed me pics of him on the team website and then also when he worked for the actual Colorado Rockies last year doing like practice catching or something. My dumb brain was instantly thinking about how fun it would it be to have \u201clife in the day of MLB girlfriend\u201d TikTok accounts instead of my current job! Lol.", "I think this is the right answer. Maybe because he plays baseball he doesn't want to hand out his phone number??", "I\u2019ve always used it as my go-to with people I don\u2019t trust with my actual phone number, but I\u2019m sure a lot of people prefer it for hookups or infidelity.", "I thought the waiter was Thanos", "Yes we would lol giving a snap instead of a number is shady af", "I think she saw a difference between buying a snack for the table and one person eating that snack as their dinner. \n\nI think OP should have just left personally.", "There\u2019s a difference between ordering a snack for the table and letting some of it go cold and one person filling up on someone else\u2019s dime. OP didn\u2019t even order a dinner because they got full. That was not the intent of purchasing the nachos.", "I was responding to the person who said paying for nonalcoholic drinks was fair", "Instagram is even further out of date", "Eh, the things I do for attractive women.", "Hey, we all get swept up in fantasies like that hahaha", "If he really is a baseball player and thinks of himself as semi famous  he may prefer snap for the social aspect ... And I wouldn't worry about the side chick thing as much because I bet he has a pretty social media friendly life you could check for significant others...", "You should tell him to call you when he works for an actual major league team, not the Rockies.", "A phone number has kinda been a private thing for me. I have several ways to communicate with people, one of them being snap. In my mind I treat it as people get a secondary contact method until I feel I trust them with my number", "That\u2019s fair. I wouldn\u2019t have stayed either if I was OP", "The intent was nachos for the table. For an entire hour, OP WAS the table.", "He said he played for their A team or something\u2026which was the website her showed me", "There's 4 levels to baseball. The minor leagues: A, AA, AAA; and Major League Baseball (MLB). The Rockies are the MLB team.   \n\n\nBut, it would be like some dude here in Daytona who plays for the Tortugas saying he \"worked for the Cincinnati Reds\".  \n\n\nHe's trying to flex. Take it as you wish. Take him on a date, and tell everyone you hooked up with a ballplayer. No need to get into details. ;)", "That means he\u2019s in the minor leagues. Still a professional baseball player and I\u2019m certain he dreams of making the majors someday, but there is definitely a difference.", "If he is 23-24 in single A unfortunately he's very unlikely to make it to the majors. Not that it hasn't happened for older players but he should be in at least AA at that age. Still, you don't need him to be a major league baseball player to still be a catch (pun intended \ud83d\ude09)"]}
