I told him I did not order them, he said \u201cyour friend Andrea called and said she was running very late and wanted you to get started.\u201d I said cool i started snacking. \n\nPretty soon this massive text wall started how everyone was running late\u2014at least an hour. I told everyone I was ok and was happy to wait since I was enjoying chatting with the server and was getting up the nerve to ask him if he had a girlfriend. I continued to snack on the nachos. \n\nAfter an hour people started to show up and nachos were gone. Andrea got there last and asked what happened to the nachos. I very casually said I ate them. She looked at me in shock and said \u201cthose were for the table, they were $35.\u201d I said I was sorry but they were getting cold and I was the only one there and I said thank you and I would pay for them. She said she already put them on her credit card when she called. I said I would gladly buy her drinks. Then in this very pissy \u201cwell I can\u2019t drink, I\u2019m pregnant and this isn\u2019t how I wanted to announce it.\u201d The pregnancy announcement changed the subject. \n\nWhen it came time to order I said I was stuffed and didn\u2019t want an entree. Andrea got really upset again and said she wasn\u2019t going to sit here and take this and got up walked out. I was in shock because I felt like even I shouldn\u2019t have eaten the nachos, I did try to make up for it.\n\nAndrea went on a tirade in the text while the rest of us were trying to eat.

That seems odd", "NTA. You could have left versus wait an hour for everyone. The nachos would have been cold and gross after an hour so no one would eat them and Andrea would still complain. Andrea didn't have to announce her pregnancy like that, so she ruined her announcement, not you. You could have offered to order another plate and pay for them instead of drinks, but she also could have said \"I was really looking forward to the nachos, not drinks\" in place of her saying she was pregnant. \n\nThe really AH here is a restaurant that charges $35 for nachos...", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask for the nachos.  You offered to make it right. She was determined to be mad and took it out on you.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong, you didn't make her mad, she (or her hormones) made herself mad", "NTA. Your friend sound self centered. Between showing up an hour late and leaving early it seems like she didn\u2019t want to be there.

It's incredibly rude to run an hour late when a meal is planned (not just to you, but to the restaurant as well - they reserved a table for a certain time and were shown zero respect).  \n\nAndrea's gesture of ordering the nachos was very nice, but her reaction to finding them gone an hour later was not. It was appropriate of you to offer to pay (which you did) and your offer to buy drinks was perfectly fair. If she has a problem with the way her pregnancy was announced, that's on her - she's the one who announced it, she could have politely declined your offer or requested you buy her entre.\n\nAndrea's pregnancy is no excuse for her behavior.", "NTA - after an hour they would have been a soggy cold mess any way.

NTA-\n1) you didn\u2019t do anything wrong (ordering something by calling the restaurant-when you\u2019re not even there-definitely implies that it\u2019s specifically for the people who ARE there, and it sounds like you were waiting for at least 30 min) \n2) you offered to make amends (that were actually unnecessary since you didn\u2019t do anything wrong) \n3) she wasn\u2019t forced into making her announcement. No, thank you would have sufficed. \n\nMy guess is that her hormones are off. Let it go. You\u2019ve already apologized and tried to make amends. Don\u2019t bring it up again.

Consider you don\u2019t have to wage money buying stuff for her baby shower/gender reveal", "NTA. Nachos do not last well. They would've been inedible by the time anyone else showed up.\n\nAlso, why was everyone an hour late to a restaurant? Like tbh, speaking as a server, that's really fucking annoying, because it means that table couldn't be used for anyone else for *hours*. If this happened at my workplace, my coworkers would probably be trying to move you to a smaller table so they could seat more people. Because it messes up the whole night when you've got customers asking why they can't have that table, you've got the owner asking why the customers can't have that table, and if you're an American server it's cutting off part of your income.\n\nJust saying, they better have had a *really* good reason.

You'd been waiting or an hour, had to keep yourself busy. As for her, probably the hormones doing their work.", "NTA but pregnancy hormones are no joke. Hopefully this will pass but now her pregnancy announcement is marred by this incident, as irrational as it is, and that will forever be the story of how she told her friends she was having a baby. Maybe you can flip it into a funny story about how you sat there for an hour mindlessly eating the congealing nachos trying to get a server's number. Curious about the size of these nachos though. $10 nachos by me are huge, way too big for 1. $35 nachos sounds like a cookie sheet piled high with several meats.\n\nEdit for spelling error", "NAH\n\nYou were hungry, you ate the nachos. If everyone wanted more, then more can be ordered. I suspect that wasn\u2019t the actual problem though.

Hope you have a better day!\u201d", "ESH - them for running super late but you should have either ordered more nachos for the table or venmo\u2019d Andrea the $35 since she basically paid for you dinner (since you only ate nachos and didn\u2019t get an entree).", "NTA. Andrea is pregnant and her hormones are all out of whack, I\u2019d chalk it up to that. There wasn\u2019t any clear communication about the damn nachos she seems so upset about and you did offer to buy her drinks, even if she couldn\u2019t drink. You\u2019re not a mind reader and that seems to be what she\u2019s wants. She announced her own pregnancy news unprompted, so that\u2019s also on her.", "Both of you were a-holes, but Andrea was worse, Pregnancy hormones or not, she made an ass of herself, but so did you.  You were okay to eat the whole plate of nachos because everyone was late, and yes, they were getting cold, but how could you have remedied this situation so you didn't become the asshole?  As soon as you realized you ate the whole plate, or nearly all of it, you should have ordered another.  I do NOT understand why this logic escaped you, and it should not have, so that makes you an a-hole.", "ESH\n\nI was about to say NTA, until I put myself in your scenario as I would imagine a portion of $35 nachos would be absolutely massive and will have taken a while to finish by yourself.\n\nI'm also assuming that this was a restaurant setting?  If so I would've also expected to have dinner with everyone else, therefore would have saved myself to spend time with my friends.\n\nIf you had space for the Nachos and dinner, then you should've dropped a message halfway through to thank them for the food and to say if you don't hurry up you'll finish it.", "ESH, them for running super late and expecting there to be nachos with cold cheese, smh!

Cold nachos are nasty, and had you not eaten them fresh, no one else would've touched them while cold so it would've gone to waste. \n\nShe may not have known everyone else was going to be late when she ordered them, but presumably she knew that SHE was going to be late when she ordered them, and as it seems like at least some of why she's upset is that she didn't get nachos, it makes all of this extra confusing.", "NTA. Your friends are incredibly rude. Showing up that late then being pissy about it.", "Huh NTA. Andrea didn't give her credit card number to order nachos for the table over the phone, she's lying.\n\nAnd even if she's not, hasn't she heard of Venmo?", "Everyone had the audacity to turn up late. Was it the elements? I don't know. But you were on time and the nachos were getting cold. And even if she was so pissy, it was *her* who blurted out she was pregnant when she didn't have to. NTA. The evening didn't go as planned and she needed a scapegoat. That had to be you. Don't feel guilty.", "So I'm guessing she ordered the nachos thinking it would be a talking point \"oh she's so nice\" not realizing or thinking everyone else was late.  I'm 100% she had this grand script/reveal planned and everyone being late and you eating the nachos ruined it.  Then she got pissy.  NTA.

And it's safer for me to give my snap instead of my number, for instance if I get a stalker I'd had to change my number which is a lot more work than deleting my snap since I'd also have to change my number on all of my documents, like at work, doctors offices etc. \n\nPlus if I give someone my number, they can find me on other sites and gain access to more private information than I am willing to share (like my school, job, or where I live) \n\nIt's just a layer of safety for people, and I'm sure some people are using snap for shady things, but don't assume the worst of everyone because it's not what you prefer.", "Ok boomer", "I sort of feel like it would have \u201caccidentally\u201d been slipped when she got mad at everyone else for drinking", "Those look good!  And yeah, I could finish those off by myself.  That'd be my dinner, as it was for OP.", "Lol yeah that\u2019s kind of dumb sounding now that I read what I wrote", "Pictures, I don't notice a difference. But videos sent between android and iphone? Completely unviewable. They end up being smaller than a quarter of the screen size, and while you can see colours and movement, it's beyond fuzzy and difficult to even know wtf is happening. Also sometimes they get sped up - especially GIFs seem to do this where they're at warp speed.\n\nI personally use Whatsapp or FB messenger more for sending pics & vids like that where I'd want the other person to be able to keep them or repeatedly see them, but I definitely use snap more to stay in daily touch with my friends (we just send one or two a day typically of what we're doing, funny anecdotes, etc.).\n\n(28F for reference).", "Lmao this is my favorite comment on the thread, so honest", "I ment that WhatsApp is easier for photos and videos sending", "I was going to say, I don\u2019t use Snapchat nearly the amount I did 5+ years ago but those two really aren\u2019t interchangeable. They serve entirely different functions for me", "Instagram has a vanish mode. You swipe up and messages will delete. Also, Signal does this as well. You can set the amount of time you want a message to show before it disappears.", "Exactly this! I hate giving out my phone number and a chat app is so much easier. People can cheat in text messages too you know.", "Use Burner or similar. Then you can give out a working number. If you don't like the person. You burn the number.", "I'm 26, turning 27 on Friday. My wife and I use snapchat almost exclusively. We also meet lots of new people around our age, and snap instead of phone number is super common. Especially if you're trying to date, you avoid having to use a second phone or give out your phone number, and you can simultaneously use it to verify that anyone you meet online is a real person that looks like their dating profile, without having to meet up in person.", "First of all I\u2019m over 35. So lmao @ you. Second of all it is a bold assumption to make that I\u2019m giving my number to anyone ever. But men still do approach me and if I was single and looking I\u2019d be sketch of anyone giving me a snap. Insta is more reputable and doesn\u2019t have the stigma of cheating and shadiness of snap.\n\nI have kids tho and none of them use snap either. So. Idk what point you were trying to make.", "OP please go on a date with this guy. We need an update lol\n\nBut only if you want to, of course.", "Thanks! That makes sense. I live in a more rural area and sometimes service is spotty so I know some of my SO's friends always want him to get snap so they can send videos. Even between him and I sometimes I need to use FB messenger and we both have androids. So that totally makes sense. \n\nI just could never figure out if I had to keep sending back pictures if I wanted to text & if so wtf am I supposed to take a picture of? And the pressure to pay attention to what I was watching in 30 seconds then its gone? Way more pressure than I need in my day. LOL", "I never thought of using something other than a texting app to send pictures. But absolutely, videos sent via text are trash, even when I send them to another android user. I pretty much use FB Messenger exclusively to send videos. (30F, and wow, just realized I'm not in my 20's anymore!)", "To be fair, if you just started talking to someone snapchat can be nice because you know if they screenshot or save the pictures.", "Yeah I have different purpose for Facebook, instagram and Snapchat because they\u2019re all different despite Mets owning two of them", "ah yes, facebook is totally known for user secrecy and deleting things.", "that's so much more complicated than just sharing an app", "My partner and I are in our early 30s and also use snap almost exclusively, same for most of our friend group. So easy to just scan someone's snap QR code and add them! Also nice if someone ends up with a new number or for international friends. \n\nI don't find this weird at all or a sign the server is too young!", "I really should. I\u2019ve been on such a cold streak and have so much dating app fatigue that I should try something different. \n\nThank you for the nudge", "He was on the Rockies for like two weeks last year or something", "That's true, I just think that there are many, many better apps for chatting online", "I thought the point was to have Snapchat for infidelity not because you care if mark Zuckerberg knows you're cheating on your SO.", "Right. And what if you and the person hit it off? I'd be mad if my partner said \"Oh actually I never gave you my real number, here you go!\""]}
