Maybe you should talk to them about it and your parent's reaction is understandable (assuming they asked calmly, which is my impression from your story).\n\nJust consider your position as the big brother a little, but apart from that you're not doing anything wrong if you don't want to correct people.

It\u2019s clear there is some cognitive dissonance here, and that\u2019s normal because you still live at home and you love your parents. \nOnce you move out and get some distance from your parents toxic judgment you will be able to feel more comfortable with discovering your own identity.\nAnd no matter what that ends up being- he/she/they, know that you are absolutely perfect. \nJust as you are. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.   It\u2019s not confusing, I promise.  At four, a kid is the perfect age to spend hours questioning everyone\u2019s gender/sex, and spend time working out the bare basics of what that means.\n\nI was once quizzed for a solid half hour on who in the family was \u201ca boy\u201d or \u201ca girl\u201d by a kid that age.   The conversation went like this:\n\n> Kid: I\u2019m a boy.  \nMe: Yes you are.  \nKid:  I have a penis.  \nMe: Cool.  \nKid: Do you have a penis?  \nMe: No.  \nKid: Are you a boy?  \nMe: No, I\u2019m a girl.  \nKid: Because you don\u2019t have a penis?  \nMe: Um.  \nKid: Is Aunty a boy?  \nMe: No.  \nKid: She looks like one.  \nMe: She looks like Aunty.  \nKid: She has hair like me.  \nMe: She does.  \nKid: Does she have a penis?  \nMe: I don\u2019t know.  \nKid: \u2026Does *Daddy* have a penis?\n\nAnd so on.   It was one of those conversations that made me convinced I was going to get put on some watch list somewhere.\n\nI had to have it again in French with a different child at the same age.

Not harder than you or your parents explaining that some people like it when you mix, some don't.", "Depends. If your siblings are smart (average intelligence and above), then it's fine, they'll sort it out themselves when they grow up. But if they're on the slower side, maybe sit down and explain it to them in simple terms. But definitely NTA", "NTA. Pronouns honestly don\u2019t mean a damn thing. Plus, it only creates unnecessary problems. They are used so we don\u2019t have to keep saying people\u2019s names over and over again.

Not to give tmi but the one that stick out the most is me going into surgery to have a testical removed due to cancer, a nurse started asking basic questions they need like \"do you have any heart problems, any implants at all\" she then asked if im PREGNANT or my PERIOD lol.", "Ive only heard them mix pronouns a couple times but only the twins not the 8yo", "I still think my parents are mostly good people and let me be my self, they have no problem with me wearing skirts, dresses, doing my nails and make up or on the other end me dressing like a fuckboy lol. They still have a long way to go but i dont think its from a bad place.", "Oh i completely understand. My youngest sister does this cutest thing where all my friends she calls my \"sisters\" regardless of gender.
