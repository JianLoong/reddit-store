I saw that one of her favourite artists was coming to the city I now live in and asked her if she wanted to go see him, about two months ago or so. I bought the tickets today because the event is on Saturday, and I was set to pick her up Thursday night (tonight), so we could have complete weekend plans and do things in the city aside from the concert. She didn\u2019t want me to pick her up Thursday night (mind you this is an hour drive, two hours there and back, and also having to drop her off Saturday night, so four in total, so I feel like it should be my call when I can and can\u2019t get her, unless she had school or an assignment or something that was on the line) and I told her the only reason I wanted to get her Thursday night was so we would have more time together on Friday, and if I got her Friday night it would be less of a entire weekend plan since I\u2019m dropping her off Saturday night. She didn\u2019t want me to come and get her for Friday because she had \u201cshit to do\u201d at 11 pm at night (which just meant that the guy she was seeing was over), which I think is just really inconsiderate because they see each other every day at school and hangouts afterwards (reported by my step sister btw) and I just wanted some extra time with her. I expressed all of this to her and how they live just 15 minutes away from each other rather than the hour I\u2019m away, this is just a rare opportunity we have a weekend together and that it really won\u2019t happen that often. She seemed to not really care and continued to just hang out with him and not express any want for us to have our day together tomorrow (also reported by my step sister lmao). This makes me not really want to go to the concert with her anymore or do that 4 hour drive either, because I feel like she was being slightly inconsiderate of my time. Am I overreacting? I know new relationships are fun and exciting but I thought this would\u2019ve been important to her since I\u2019m her sister.

She is in the flush of first time love - it\u2019s chemical and hard to reason with. \n\nHaving said that - you have a perfect right to spend your time and money on people who appreciate it. Take a friend and enjoy the concert!", "Have you tried, \u201cHey sis, I was excited to take you to the concert because I know how much you love the artist, but I was also really hoping we could spend some time together this weekend. Is there any chance you could change your Thursday night plans? If I pick you up Friday it\u2019s a lot of hours in the car for me for such a short visit.\u201d?\n\nAlso, on a practical level, could your sister take a train, subway, etc. into the city and you pick her up at the station? It might not work late on a Saturday, but Thursday/Friday after school could be doable.\n\nI think I\u2019m going with NAH. You want to see your sister, you\u2019re not an AH. Your sister is 15 and infatuated with her new beau, not sure she\u2019s an AH either, just 15. You probably need to communicate what you\u2019re hoping for and why clearly and lovingly.", "Why bother?  It's apparent that sister doesn't share your desire to have time together.   IMO there isn't enough time for anyone to spend it on people who do not have the same interest in us.", "NTA\n\nBut what can you do, teenagers are stupid when they\u2019re in a new relationship. We\u2019ve all been there, and we all regret it once we get older and wiser.", "NAH- when you\u2019re 15 you hormones are going crazy and the first relationship seems like the most important thing in the world. I saw it with my 15 year old cousin who acted like her arm had been cut off when she came away for a family holiday without her new boyfriend in the summer. You wanted to spend time with her and do a nice thing for her. Just have a chat about it.", "NTA,\n\nI guess she doesn't wanna go? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nHer loss ig", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
