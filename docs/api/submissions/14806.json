I am basically a live-in Nanny for them and I live in their house rent free because I don't have a job. Both my brother and his wife work. When they first got pregnant, they asked me to move in with them with the promise that they would pay me for child care. Well that only lasted a month and they proceeded to have 3 more kids in the process. I never complained cause I do live in their house rent free and I know he really needed the help. Well they recently came into money trouble and they now owe an insane amount of money. They have both been working extra hours to make up what they owe.\n\nOn to what happened: it's been really cold lately and because of that the house has been really cold. To turn on the heaters is a process and I don't know how to do it so my brother has been turning them all on except for my room. My room is now the coldest in the house. I can't sleep at night even with all the thickest blankets. I get pain when I am cold so I'm up all night in pain.\n\n I have been exhausted watching 4 kids by myself all day. I have been asking my brother to turn my heater on but he keeps saying he'll get to it. Well a week ago he told me that he was never turning my on cause he needs to keep the bills down. \n\nI asked him if I just have it on at night and turn the ones in the main room off during the night. He said no that it's his house and he'll do whatever pleases in his house and I don't get a say cause I don't help financially. \n\nI didn't say anything to him right away. I just texted my mom and asked she could pick me up. After she said she could, I told him that my mom was coming and I'll see if someone can come pick up my stuff soon. He asked me what I meant and I only told him that he needs to find someone else to watch his kids. Either get a nanny or one of them quits because I am not doing it anymore. He told me that I was being dramatic and that he'll give me time to calmed down. I said I didn't need time and he told me to think of the kids and how they're super attached to me. I said I'll still see them with a parent present because I don't plan on babysitting. \n\nAt this point his wife is trying to diffuse the situation and my mom showed up and I asked if it was okay for me to move back in with her and she agreed and said she'll have my step-dad come pick my stuff up tomorrow. My brother has been blowing up my phone and he told our dad so now he's blowing up my phone too. My dad texted me asking how I could abandon them knowing they're struggling. \n\nI feel bad cause I did abandon them but I couldn't do it anymore.

They're treating you as a slave by not paying you and not heating your room.\n\nDon't go back. Ask your mom if it's okay to take a month to decompress, then look for a job. I'm glad you could move back with your mom.", "NTA\n\nyou were essentially enslaved. You should have been something. Feel guilty about it from a nice, warm bed.", "Ha, nta, you didn\u2019t abandon anyone. It\u2019s his house and his rules. His rules were to screw Cinderella and it worked. Now it\u2019s his house and his rules and his problem to find childcare. Don\u2019t feel bad at all. You did the right thing. If they cared about you they would have figured something out with the heat for you but they didn\u2019t care.", "NTA. You're working for free and getting nothing out of it but a place to sleep without basic necessities like heat. If you were able to work as well while being a nanny it wouldn't be so bad but not getting paid means you'll never be able to get out of this situation.", "NTA. They are using and abusing you. You've been working for free for years and they can't even let you have heat at night?!? That's insane! They don't deserve your help. You didn't abandon them, they abandoned you. All you did was leave an abusive situation.  What kind of person won't let you have heat? They got themselves in this situation.  If you ever agree to watch their kids again make them pay you before you actually do it. If they don't pay, you don't stay to watch the kids. But if I were you I just wouldn't answer the phone.", "NTA - you can realistically earn money and have a comfortable place to live as an au pair (live-in nanny). Your brother was neither paying you and giving you a comfortable place to live. Not sure what your work hours were with your brother, but an au pair usually works a specific number of hours a week, and the rest of the time they have off to do whatever they want. Like evenings or weekends.", "NTA.  No one needs to put up with being treated as a lesser being.", "Stay at your mother\u2019s. Get a job that pays money and support yourself.", "NTA \n\nthe idea that you don't deserve heat is ridiculous. so is the thought that you don't contribute anything financial to the household. your brother is terrible and i am happy that you are getting out of there. the kids will be tended to in some way. it's not your fault if your brother is struggling.", "NTA.  IF they valued your contribution to the house, they could have turned on your heater. They showed you how little they think of you.  GOOD FOR  YOU for standing up for yourself!", "You are most definitely not the asshole. \nThey are toasty and warm while you lose sleep over arthritis pain??? You can\u2019t go out with friends because you have to be at their beck and call? You aren\u2019t being paid? Please please please don\u2019t let them guilt you into returning.", "They can struggle in a well heated house. So now he really doesn't have to worry about saving money for one room. He can use that to go towards a babysitter. NTA", "NTA. OP I was in the same situation as you with my cousin from my paternal side. My cousin only paid me $240.00 USD for the three years of being a live in nanny for 4 kids. I didn\u2019t know she was financially abusing me until a friend of mine told me. I got my things and left her. I didn\u2019t care. Last year she called me to be a live in nanny again and offered me $200. USD per week. I declined since I didn\u2019t want to raise her children and I already have a job. OP stand your ground try to keep your self busy. Try getting a part time job. Your brother and his wife are AH.", "Is this a Dicken's novel?\n\nNTA", "NTA, you need to leave.  He said you \u201cdon\u2019t get a say because you don\u2019t contribute financially\u201d but you take care of 4 kids?  How much is that worth?  Screw him, you need to bail.", "NTA\n\nWhere I live, 5 days of child care, from 8am to 4pm is about $1400 USD per child.  \n  \nYou probably provided around $5600 dollars in free labor to them every month. Likely more if they\u2019re working overtime and you\u2019re watching the kids for more than 8 hours a day.  \n  \nBased on the numbers where I live, let\u2019s say they charged you $1200 a month for rent. Another $200 for utilities and $200 for food.  \n  \nYou\u2019re contributing $4000 dollars a month in free child care. Even if the numbers are different in your area, there\u2019s no situation where he\u2019s not extracting tens of thousands of dollars from you in free labor.", "nta and I applaud you for putting ur foot down and standing up for yourself , it is rare for people to say no when they\u2019re being used . Good job OP", "NTA Your brother is abusive and you've essentially been a slave to them this whole time. A live in nanny also gets a place to live rent free, but they still get paid because they're doing work. Keep looking for a job and never go back there. Don't let your brother or dad or anyone else guilt trip you into going back, you deserve to live your own life and be paid a proper wage for your labor.", "NTA. Now your brother, on the other hand, is definitely TA. Also, if your dad really wants to get involved in this, maybe he should help his son and watch his grandchildren.", "You forgot the TL:DR   \n\"My brother turned me into his house slave and is now upset that I managed to escape.\"   \n\n\nNTA your brother is a total asshole here and you should have left after the first month.  He should be grateful that you lasted this long and I'm surprised your parents never stepped in to help you.", "OP, they're using you as a slave. Your dad can go move into their icy room and watch four kids for free if it's so important. Suggest it to him!\n\nOtherwise, get your stuff and never go back. They'll try all the usual stuff: yelling, pleading, begging, threatening, but don't cave. They need you. You don't need them.", "More than financially if they left her in a freezing room.", "Is this shit even legal? It sounds like modern day slavery.", "And physically as OP is in pain due to the frigid temps in the room and emotionally abusing as well.  Glad there\u2019s a way out.", "Otherwise, get your stuff and never go back.", "and physically  by being forced to stay in an unheated room.", "He probably knows", "Would OP have a case for the labor board for this even though it was a family thing?", "This!", "I can heat my whole house all year cheaper than 1 month daycare for 1 child...her brother FAFO hard here.", "He is not a acknowledging your contribution to the household.  They are only able to work because you are taking care of their children.   If you are not contributing to the financial health of the household, leaving will improve their situation. \n\nNever. Go. Back.", "Also having one roof cold means they have to pay more to heat the other rooms.", "They agreed to pay you. Then they didn\u2019t.", "[removed]", "Where I live, daycare for 4 kids full time is about $6k/mth on average depending on children's ages just to give you an idea of just how much you were being underpaid.", "Average live in nanny salary in the USA is 40-50k a year,  this is for 1 child,  40-50 hour work weeks and includes their housing. Your brother has essentially been stealing 50k+ a year from you as well as severely overworking you.  You have absolutely no reason to feel guilty about leaving an abusive situation.", "He\u2019s struggling because he had more kids then he could afford. That doesn\u2019t mean he gets to take advantage of you or guilt trip you. He\u2019s a grown man and can figure things out on his own.", "They are not making good financial choices. If they can not afford childcare for 4 children\u2026..they shouldn\u2019t have had 4 children.", "Stop saying you were living there for free because you weren\u2019t. They weren\u2019t even paying you properly, you were 100% taken advantage of. Every time he tries to say you lived there for free correct him and say you did not. You lived there in exchange for services, plus you were supposed to get a set salary which he reneged. You shouldn\u2019t have to ask money for bills or to go out, you should be able to budget and receive a set amount on a set time schedule.", "He wasn't struggling so much he couldn't keep having more kids. Buying you gifts while refusing to provide you heat was no different than an abusive husband buying his battered wife flowers. Maybe now your idiot brother will realize turning on the fucking heat was cheaper than childcare for four kids. If your stepdad is so concerned about your brother and his kids, he is more than welcome to help out. You provided more than enough help to your brother, now he can pull himself up by his bootstraps and do it himself. NTA\n\nINFO: what money trouble  are they in, that they owe an insane amount? It sounds MLMish to me.", "Right? Especially in the under 4 group. Childcare is insane.", "I'm so sorry.", "Damn!!! You had arthritis since 16?", "This! Exactly. A lot of times one parent stays home until their kids are school age because the cost of childcare is more than they take home in income", "They're gonna find that out now, for sure. It's too bad that they won't see it as their own fault most likely.", "Good for you. You deserve to have a life. Get a job, have coworker, hangout with friend.
