I think your mom is enabling his actions, and that\u2019s not right. His actions are causing people to possibly be uncomfortable, and he should be held accountable for that", "NTA - you should be able to have friends over without them feeling uncomfortable.\n\nCurious though - you mentioned his ability to \"function\" is near normal. Are you referring to basic self care and the like? Would you be able to speak to him about it directly or would he not understand it mentally? If he has poor social skills/boundaries, it may not make a difference, but it may be worth trying. Maybe he'd learn better ways of interacting appropriately.

Your brother is disabled- he didnt do anything to deserve it. His life is probably not as colourful as yours, his probably not as social as you and doesnt have much friends. Your friends are probably the only females around his age that he interacts with or even sees, so it is natural for him to have a crush on at least one of them. Commenting on your friends post to say she\u2019s beautiful is not offensive, yet you both see it that way and why? If your friend is not into him she could politely say that to him and that would be that or just simply ignore him. If it was any other guy that she wasn\u2019t interested in, she wouldv done exactly that and this would be a non-issue. \n\n2. Not once have you mentioned that you tried to speak to him about any of this, youve just been running to your mother and she\u2019s clearly tired of your immaturity and disregard of him. \n\n3. Your mother is not favouring him: he is disabled and obviously needs more care and it doesnt sound like you help in that department at all. \n\nI honestly cannot understand how you dont have any empathy for him and resent him for being disabled. \n\nYTA and it\u2019s shameful that this is how you feel about your own flesh and blood when he has done nothing to you to justify your feelings toward him.", "How is commenting \u201cyoure beautiful\u201d on a post inappropriate?", "PLEASE EXPLAIN TO BE: how does commenting \u201cyoure beautiful\u201d on a post lead to someone being uncomfortable?", "I was referring to his ability to function as in his ability to walk, talk, hold conversations. Which his ability to walk is still slightly impaired, like he trips frequently but is not dependent upon another person to live daily. I feel if I spoke to him about this he would in turn talk to my mom as well which would then erupt into a large argument.", "Thank you! I just read a few chapters of this after you mentioned it and from what I have read it absolutely hits every aspect of my situation and how I have felt for a very long time. I can\u2019t wait to read more.", "They were mainly physical, he has a hard time walking and writing but he also has trouble with speech and his learning in school was delayed but his ability to understand social cues and such are fine.", "I am going to explain why I speak to my mom about these issues instead because if I speak to him about it it turns into him making snide remarks then running to my mother to say things I didn\u2019t say then it turns into a larger argument. I would rather save myself the time and go ahead and speak to her because she is the only one who can speak to him about things without it being an argument. \nAlso for your third remark he is not wheelchair bound and can function on his own. When we were younger absolutely I would look out for him since we were around the same grade in school and help at home but there comes a point when I was a child as well not a caretaker. \nI just wanted to explain a few details for you and maybe anyone else reading this thread.", "I'm an high  functioning autistic woman. Growing up I never wanted to hang out around disabled boys like this. I nearly had one molest me in high school. Because he wasn't ever told the word no either by his parents or by the school. Often they do know that it is wrong but never have any consequences.", "when he's doing it enough and consistently that the person posting the pictures is talking about it being to much with his sister, it is obviously unacceptable.", "Key word was \u201cpossibly\u201d. But having your friend\u2019s brother or sibling comment both \u201cyou\u2019re gorgeous\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d can be awkward or uncomfortable for people. They might not know the brother personally so they might be uncomfortable by the comments.", "I hope it helps you find peace.", "ESH but your brother. Your friend can let him know gently that she is not interested. As someone with siblings close in age, it wasn't uncommon for a sibling to be interested in a friend or a friend interested in them.", "Thats thats the issue right there. \n\nYour issue is not with your brother making your friend feel uncomfortable with his comments on a post- because thats just inane. My brother would literally hit on my friends and they would just laugh it off or ignore him and that would be that- people commenting on posts is exactly what happens when you put up a post. He didn\u2019t harass her, he complimented her and just because of that- his somehow castrated? \n\nYour issue is that you no longer want to be supportive sister and daughter. You feel like you have your own life now which is all fair but be honest about that and speak about that instead you posting about your brother in such a negative way when he honestly hasnt done anything to deserve it.", "I feel like the sister is transferring her negative emotions on her brother to her friends and thats the cause if them being uncomfortable. Because commenting on someones posts is a normal thing to do on social media- there literally is a commenting function. I am sure he is not the only person commenting on the post and i doubt she finds all the comments awkward- if that was the case, she would have turned off the comment option.", "If she doesnt want comments- why not switch the comments off on her post? He complimented her and it\u2019s being turned around like his harassing her.", "Why should she have to turn HER comments off on her page because hes a weirdo? Maybe he just just stop", "How does complimenting someone make him a weirdo?"]}
