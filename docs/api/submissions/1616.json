We've been together 6 years. \n\nHe was devastated when she died. I told him I never expected to \"replace\" her in any way & considered myself another chapter in his life. I was warmly accepted into the family and his circle of friends. \n\nMy sister recently she fell on hard times - lost her job, apartment, and so on. We took her in. \n\nMy husband has always had a home office. My sister was poking around the house when he was out, and discovered a photo of him & his first wife among the framed pictures he has. It's not their wedding photo or anything, just a typical cute couple photo. It's the only printed photo of her in the house, taken a few months before her accident. They didn't have kids, so pics are all he has. \n\nThere are a lot more photos of us.\n\nI was reading on the couch when my sister came stomping into the room, holding the framed photo.\n\nShe angrily asked \"Why do you let him keep a photo of his ex in your house?\"\n\nI replied: \"First, it's our house, & second she's not an ex. She died in an accident and was his wife for 8 years. She was a huge part of his life. He keeps that one photo out.\"\n\nShe replied  \"An ex is anyone you've slept with who's not in the picture anymore.\"\n\nMe: \"No, that's not how it works. She *died*.\"\n\nSis: \"Doesn't matter. So what if she got pasted by a truck, an ex is an ex. You shouldn't be letting him keep any pictures.\"\n\nMe: \"You're being extremely disrespectful to me & my husband right now. You're a guest in this house. Walk back those comments & apologize, now.\"\n\nSis: \"Why should I apologize? How can you let him keep pictures of an ex-fucktoy?\"\n\nI never knew his first wife, but I know how much she meant to him. I know how much he loves *me*. My sister talking about her like that insulted him, & by extension me - not to mention how disrespectful she was being to a poor woman who died young. \n\nI said: \"Get your crap and leave.\"\n\nI didn't care that it was November in MN, or that she didn't have anywhere else to go, or any money. She had been beyond disrespectful to me and my husband, over a single small photo. \n\nMe: \"If you're worried about sleeping in your car this winter, you should've thought of that before insulting the people sheltering you.\"\n\nI made sure she was gone before my husband even got home. He was shocked when I told him what'd happened, since he'd always had a polite-neutral relationship with her. He thanked me for having his back.\n\nI got a call from my mom, telling me it was my responsibility to take care of my sister. I laughed and hung up.\n\nI've been asked by a few people how I could basically destroy my relationship with my sister over this, and have replied that she was the one who did so. \n\nAITA for how I handled this?", "created_utc": 1667748647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynt2y6/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_over_a_photo_of_my/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if they still disagreed with the explanation they would still let it go because it's *none of their business and it doesn't impact their life in any way*.\n\nYour sister doubled down and died on a very stupid hill - determined to disregard your feelings and disrespect both you and your husband.
