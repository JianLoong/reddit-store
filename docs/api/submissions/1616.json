We've been together 6 years. \n\nHe was devastated when she died. I told him I never expected to \"replace\" her in any way & considered myself another chapter in his life. I was warmly accepted into the family and his circle of friends. \n\nMy sister recently she fell on hard times - lost her job, apartment, and so on. We took her in. \n\nMy husband has always had a home office. My sister was poking around the house when he was out, and discovered a photo of him & his first wife among the framed pictures he has. It's not their wedding photo or anything, just a typical cute couple photo. It's the only printed photo of her in the house, taken a few months before her accident. They didn't have kids, so pics are all he has. \n\nThere are a lot more photos of us.\n\nI was reading on the couch when my sister came stomping into the room, holding the framed photo.\n\nShe angrily asked \"Why do you let him keep a photo of his ex in your house?\"\n\nI replied: \"First, it's our house, & second she's not an ex. She died in an accident and was his wife for 8 years. She was a huge part of his life. He keeps that one photo out.\"\n\nShe replied  \"An ex is anyone you've slept with who's not in the picture anymore.\"\n\nMe: \"No, that's not how it works. She *died*.\"\n\nSis: \"Doesn't matter. So what if she got pasted by a truck, an ex is an ex. You shouldn't be letting him keep any pictures.\"\n\nMe: \"You're being extremely disrespectful to me & my husband right now. You're a guest in this house. Walk back those comments & apologize, now.\"\n\nSis: \"Why should I apologize? How can you let him keep pictures of an ex-fucktoy?\"\n\nI never knew his first wife, but I know how much she meant to him. I know how much he loves *me*. My sister talking about her like that insulted him, & by extension me - not to mention how disrespectful she was being to a poor woman who died young. \n\nI said: \"Get your crap and leave.\"\n\nI didn't care that it was November in MN, or that she didn't have anywhere else to go, or any money. She had been beyond disrespectful to me and my husband, over a single small photo. \n\nMe: \"If you're worried about sleeping in your car this winter, you should've thought of that before insulting the people sheltering you.\"\n\nI made sure she was gone before my husband even got home. He was shocked when I told him what'd happened, since he'd always had a polite-neutral relationship with her. He thanked me for having his back.\n\nI got a call from my mom, telling me it was my responsibility to take care of my sister.

Also, under the population studies I searched GBM and these were the latest studies:\n\n>Compared with never-users, no statistically significant associations were found, overall or by tumor subtype, for daily cellular telephone use or for having used cellular telephones for at least 10 years. Taking use in 2011 as baseline, there were no statistically significant associations with talking for at least 20 minutes per week or with at least 10 years use. For gliomas occurring in the temporal and parietal lobes, the parts of the brain most likely to be exposed to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from cellular telephones, relative risks were slightly below 1.0.\r  \n\r  \n**Conclusion**\r  \nOur findings support the accumulating evidence that cellular telephone use under usual conditions does not increase brain tumor incidence.\n\n[https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/114/5/704/6554484](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/114/5/704/6554484)\n\n>**Conclusion**\r  \nThere is no indication of any increase related to the use of mobile phones. These results are similar to results in Australia and in many other countries. The increase in recorded incidence at ages over 80 is similar to that seen in other countries and consistent with improved diagnostic methods.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782122001394](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782122001394)\n\n>**Conclusions**\r  \nOur findings indicate that glioma incidence trends among men aged 40\u201359 years in the Nordic countries are not consistent with increased risks of moderate effect size (RR > 1.2\u20131.4) assuming latency up to 20 years. This means that increased risks reported in some case-control studies are implausible and likely attributable to biases and errors in self-reported use of mobile phone. Our results were consistent with results from prospective cohort studies showing no association between mobile phone use and risk of glioma.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022004147](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022004147)\n\nSo you see, it is not that I do not want to believe it.

I suppose my next thoughts would be who is funding the studies, since far too often it\u2019s the very people who have the most to gain (or loose) based on the outcome.  And It\u2019s getting more and more difficult to find the good independent sources.   What we have right now are three large industries (government, military and telecommunications) that each have very strong reasons for wanting us to move forward with the use of higher and higher energy level frequencies.  So there\u2019s the level of energies that\u2019s a factor.  Then there\u2019s the quantity.  This new cell platform requires an exponentially greater amount of signals than anything that came before it just to operate.  Then there\u2019s whether it\u2019s pulsed or not.  There\u2019s a video showing the effects that pulsed frequencies can have on red blood cells in certain individuals.  I will try to find and link it.  The book on electricity does a great job discussing the effects that each new installation of harnessed energy has had on people during the era of its rollout.    As for earbuds, they operate on an owner/slave principle.  One piece receives the signal from your phone and then transmits it out to the other earbud, basically through your head.  The cellular damage may be minuscule but quantity matters over time.   And it\u2019s non-ionizing radiation as opposed to ionizing.  That matters because ionizing radiation will break cell cells walls leading to apoptosis (cell death).  But non-ionizing radiation may not lead to cell death.  Instead it may lead to leaky cell walls, or mutations.  This is why EMFs are linked to cancer at a higher incidence.   Our worst exposure used to just be from over use of our phone or wearing earbuds everywhere we went.  But now our entire bodies are being bathed in an excess of new frequencies now everywhere we go.  When wifi was first introduced there used to be a term \u2018wifi flu.\u2019  And it was the dry cough you got from being around wifi for too long.  Now you never hear the term anymore.  I suppose we all adapted.  But honestly, I think one component of this whole COVID situation is the newest frequency exposures and our bodies having to adapt again.  It\u2019s mild radiation sickness.  How well can your body fight off a pathogen when it\u2019s already in a compromised state?        \nFound this article on the blood effects as well. \n\nhttps://www.shieldyourbody.com/emf-blood/  \n\nhttps://bioinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/BioInitiativeReport-RF-Color-Charts.pdf\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BoHLFZlaeKw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/y4JDEspdx58\n\nThis one cites many research sources. \nhttps://ehtrust.org/scientific-documentation-cell-phone-radiation-associated-brain-tumor-rates-rising/", "Hey, please remember that it's successful something like 99% of the time!

These were independant studies with no links to any corporate interest. I get that this is a subject that is hard to understand, therefore it is easy to exploit people's fears with, but the bottom line is that I personally know many people who are in scientific and health research fields. They are not being bribed or coerced with money or any other incentives to bias their findings. In fact, any one of those studies can be challenged after publication if others repeat the work and are able to show the issues with methodology and/or findings. If you discount everything that does not agree with your already held beliefs, you run the risk of cognitive bias which is the stuff conspiracies are made of. \n\nAgain, I am not saying that RF and electro-magnetic waves can not affect humans at the biological/cellular level.

Your sister was way out of line and you did the right thing. \n\nWhy is it your responsibility to take care of your sister?  Your mother can do it.", "You\u2019re my hero.  You\u2019re an awesome wife and you were absolutely correct to respond as you did.  Your sister sounds incredibly insensitive.  Also, what business is it of hers what you and your husband choose to have in your home?  \nNTA, and your sister needs better manners, especially when she\u2019s a houseguest.", "NTA, she was an ass just to be one. She got what she deserved.", "NTA - on the contrary, this was the perfect way to handle this situation.  Bravo!!! Pat yourself on the back and give your husband a big hug and tell him you\u2019ll always have his back", "NTA. Your sister is the only AH here. Please don\u2019t feel guilty. And it is not your responsibility to take care of your sister. It\u2019s your mothers. Let her go live with her", "NTA. I don't even have words for how spiteful that sounds coming from your sister. You did nothing wrong, and did EXACTLY what a loving supportive spouse should do. If, mom or anyone else is so concerned, they can take the brat in. If not, they can f\\*ck off.", "NTA I really hope this isn't real because it's just so extremely inappropriate. Calling his deceased wife a fucktoy is absolutely outrageous. No, you did NOTHING wrong and I would have been pissed at you on your husband's behalf if you had let her stay. She deserves to be out in the cold. You don't bite the hand that feeds you, and she tried to tear a whole arm off.", "NTA you're a boss.", "NTA, your mom can take her in if she's that worried about her.", "NTA. I have an inkling why she would lose her job and home if this is her personality.", "NTA. Your sister and mom, though . . .", "I'm so sorry that your sister is an asshole. You are NTA. You respect your husband and his first wife that he lost. That's very admirable.", "NTA. Wow. Your sister said some gutsy and insulting stuff. You did good by kicking her out. She\u2019s not your responsibility at all.", "NTA. She was totally out of line. You did the right thing. People need to learn their actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m just imagining how horrible it would have been for your husband to hear it directly. An ex &\u00a3#! toy! Geez. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear them.", "NTA\n\nYou were completely justified. Your sister had no right to say such horrible, ridiculous things about someone she never met. Calling his late wife a \"fucktoy\", and saying he shouldn't have pictures of her anymore is disgusting and beyond disrespectful. If I were him, I'd never want to see your sister ever again.", "NTA and hold crap your sister is a rude, obnoxious sh*t. She deserves exactly what she got, you should feel zero guilt. Hopefully this will teach her a lesson about being respectful, especially to people being so generous to her.", "NTA.  You are super good to your husband and respecting the love he had for his first wife.  Your sister was rude and crude in her comments and doesn\u2019t deserve to be housed with you right now.  Hopefully she will learn the difference between an ex and a widower\u2019s departed wife. If your parents are so concerned, they can house your sister.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nAnd damn good job having your hub's back, and for understanding that he loved her and he loves you. \n\nBRAVO!!\n\nSis is the major AH for dictating to you what can be in your house.  If she had her sh#t together, she woulsnt need a place to stay.", "NTA. It's your MOMS responsibility to take care of her not you. She signed up to be a mom you didn't sign up for her. She disrespected you, your husband and his deceased wife. She doubled down when you told her to stop and gave her a warning.", "NTA. Let your asshole mother take in your asshole sister.", "**NTA** \\- What was she doing going through your house, your things?  Was she scoping out things to pawn or sell?  You didn't destroy your relationship with your sister, she did by being nosy and expecting you to bend down to her rules, in your own home.  Your mother shouldn't be guilting you either.  If she tolerates her daughter dictating to her how she should run her life, fine ... let her do it.", "Hard NTA.\n\nIt's your house and your marriage. She can stfu and be grateful for your charity.", "NTA, that was incredibly insensitive and disgusting of her. She has her own problems to work through clearly, but those are not your problems.", "NTA. It shows your true heart how you\u2019ve handled the situation.", "NTA. You married your husband, not your sister. He comes before your sister.

I don\u2019t think it would have even occurred to anyone in the family to look down on her or my dad for keeping her late husband\u2019s memory alive (it\u2019s not like she pits them against one another or compares them), and I know it means the world to my stepmom that my dad is comfortable with it. That\u2019s just love and respect, plain and simple. My respect for him certainly would have gone down if he was immature or insecure enough to pick a fight over it or be threatened by it!", "Lost my 10 year old nephew to chordoma.

Sending you a gentle hug.", "While I know a lot of women like your girlfriend (sadly) that seems to think they are competing with the dead, I know just as many that wouldn't care about pictures around the house, might prefer a small memorial, and only a few would request that it be somewhere private to the widowed spouse. I'm sorry your girlfriend is in the first category.", "I am so sorry!!! My dad died of GBM, but he was 85 and had a very full life. Your brother died way too young.", "As someone who grew up in a very chaotic family dynamic, I've heard stuff like this and worse said in real life.", "Hope your dad and sister find their way past their diagnosis.

Our last declaw was like 15 years ago. Anyway our baby kitty, a year old, is keeping his claws and we have not been successful in trimming his nails despite experience with many animals. He just fights too hard. We may end up getting a sedative from the vet because even our vet can't clip his nails with all his decades of experience. I just don't want to drug my baby. I have also been in wound care and had 4 or 5 rounds of antibiotics just because of his scratches on me but he has been being really careful with me lately like he's figured out mommy can't get scratched and it isn't ok (we've never done more than verbally scold him, you can't punish him for normal cat behavior and I don't believe in corporal punishment for animals at all).

Maybe that\u2019s something your gf needs to work on, because it is definitely not a healthy response.\n\nIf something happened to my husband, I will NEVER erase him from my life. I would find that too disrespectful to his memory. This is somebody that I made a commitment to to love for the rest of my life. It\u2019s just unfortunate that they fulfilled that promise instead of me, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I can just forget a commitment to share my life with this person and act like they didn\u2019t exist. If any romantic partner had an issue with that they would be shown the door.\n\nMaybe that would mean I would end up alone, so be it.\n\nAgain, this is not a judgement on you.

Almost all the big deaths I've been through since 2015 have been in fall/winter (one of the death anniversaries was 2-3 days ago), and those two seasons are definitely hard to deal with sometimes.
