It can also mean \u201cfeeling or expressing sympathy or pity.\u201d \n\nThis is why it\u2019s normal for someone to say \u201cI am sorry for your loss\u201d or \u201cI am sorry you didn\u2019t get the job.\u201d \n\nI am guessing your gf just wanted a little more acknowledgment of her feelings in this time of stress.\n\nIn my opinion, ESH. You are an A for being so stubborn in your idea of how to use the word \u201csorry\u201d as to make her feel bad in an already distressing situation. She was also an A for pushing you on using this specific word rather than recognize your offer of help was your way of showing that you felt bad for her and her experience. \n\nHonestly, you both need to figure out a way to communicate with each other more effectively.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sorry", "Just an FYI for many people, saying your \u201csorry something happened to someone\u201d isn\u2019t an apology, or any admission or acknowledgment of guilt, it is used as words of support, and comfort.   \nFor example \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss\u201d is used the same way as \u201cIm so sorry that happened to you\u201d.

You have shown you empathize by offering support financially for the remainder of the trip and support logistically once you return home. \n\nThis is a miscommunication. She wants with words what you are showing with actions (which imo are worth more). That's a conversation you can have when you get back home.\n\nIf you want to try and smooth things over for the remainder of your trip, maybe try \"I hate that this happened to you, I know it sucks.\" Because when everyone else is saying \"I'm so sorry!\", that is what they mean too.", ">Everyone was telling her how sorry they were that it happened to her.

Your stepping up and offering to cover all expenses during the trip and sorting it out later was supportive, appropriate and kind.  \n\nHer making such a big deal out of needing/expecting an apology from you is unreasonable and even ridiculous as most assuredly you've done nothing wrong.

You stepped up and offered to front her the cash during the trip so the actual trip wouldn't be affected, so you were very helpful and considerate.

She's stressed out, and that sucks, but she's taking it out on you because you're the person closest to her right now.

However, apart from the simple fact that you've covered everything with no complaint and carried the weight, and deserve some recognition for that, a lack of that would still not justify her **yelling at you.** I'd strongly consider if this is the kind of woman you want to be with, someone who considers the support and service you give out of love as her just due, and the lack of a token apology as justification to treat you like shit.", "Nta", "Uh, that's bizarre. You didn't steal her money. You are being supportive. What's to be sorry about? \n\nShe has a screw loose to pick an argument over this. Red flag.", "Honestly I\u2019m surprised how much I disagree with the comments, just criticising her\u2026 Neither of you are assholes unless there is more detail we don\u2019t know. Seems like a communication issue. But let me tell you, unless she has a history of putting you down or some attention like antics. You are the person more at fault\u201d or at least responsible for the escalation of the argument. It seems like you don\u2019t understand the definition of \u201capology for\u201d, it means show sympathy. She had a really shitty day and you decided to die on a petty minor hill. That could honestly be more hurtful to her than the fact you didn\u2019t say sorry. I understand you could also be hurt you offered help in your own way, and she was mean to you the same day. I do think if you didn\u2019t get the meaning she had the opportunity to also listen and figure that out rather than be upset. But again she had technically a worse day. Still you are allowed to express that you didn\u2019t like that she yelled. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. \n\nBut I hope you don\u2019t base your worldview on what the NTA people are saying. The way you behaved could be a major issue for you in relationships moving forward, more than her\u2026. \nHave you considered if you are on the autistic spectrum? This taking words too literally is a common problem that leads to conflict. Additionally, you seem to either struggle reading her and other peoples emotions (confused about the family apologising), also to some extend maybe your emotions are a bit number when exposed to emotions of others. Another potential sign you might be on the autism spectrum. It\u2019s not a big deal but Ita good to be aware off if it\u2019s the case. It can also be that you just are more literal and emotionally flat. But just don\u2019t fall for this \u201cI was being rational and she was emotional\u201d, this mindset ruins so many relationship. (Often for men since they are taught to suppress their emotional needs).\n\nHonestly best of luck to both of you!", "Yta so according to you when I go to a funeral and say sorry for your loss, I\u2019m personally responsible for the death of their family member?

Money is not a substitute for empathy. \n\nHow did you express empathy for her situation? Not a solution. Empathy.", "I\u2019m leaning on NTA - ONLY CONTINGENT upon the below potential points.\n\nMy main question here - have you explored any level of neurodivergence?? I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed (hecking late and through psych - not tiktok for anyone who must know the \u201cvalidity\u201d) autism on top of ADHD and have had this occur (though not to this degree) multiple times before I figured out that people don\u2019t take \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d as an admission of guilt unless you\u2019re actually in a court room for something like a car accident. \n\nIf the semantics here make logical sense but also feel hard coded in your bones as a kind of \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019m sorry and I don\u2019t want to lie to you\u201d maybe consider expressing that point and following up on an eval for ADHD/Autism/etc. I can\u2019t speak to the other options since I am not diagnosed with them.\n\nYou clearly care that she\u2019s hurting, you were present and seem to have the ability to help with the logical next steps, but the expected path here for people in a neurodivergent boat similar to me would be something along the lines of - \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that this has happened, it\u2019s incredibly stressful. I\u2019ve got your back and we\u2019ll figure this out. You\u2019re not alone\u201d. \n\nNot saying be disingenuous but your \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and everyone else\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d seem to clearly be separated by literal vs empathetic definitions. I doubt she\u2019d take you saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d as some sort of fault based on all of this. \n\nAll to say - talk with her about this later when she\u2019s gotten the support from you she needs and if she questions your apology let her know that you didn\u2019t understand that an apology in this instance was you not being empathetic but you realize maybe you have some neurodivergence that you are considering looking into when you get back because you care about her and never meant to not be present in the way she needed. (LATER, definitely not now) ask her if she can let you know if you don\u2019t respond in the way she feels supported. This will help neurodivergent or not. \u201cWant me to listen or to help you solution?\u201d. Even if you\u2019re not neurodivergent but just of a more \u201clogic\u201d based mindset - she probably wants to feel connection and support, not logic she can sort out for herself after she feels her valid emotions\n\nFast follow edit:\n\nTo be clear - overall I still don\u2019t think your TA here anyway. It doesn\u2019t seem like you lack care and maybe there are other points. \n\nHaving my own experiences traveling abroad and the shit show/struggle major issues can be outside of a country you are comfortable in I can empathize with her added stress. NO reason to yell or make anyone else be a dick. In that sense, she\u2019s TA. But honestly I think this is a fresh relationship, it\u2019s intriguing y\u2019all are already out of the country together (personal opinion), and there\u2019s more opportunity for growth if you\u2019re willing to understand all of the perspectives and factors impacting here.

Honestly, Either they both were being slow, him not knowing the meaning of \u201cfeeling sorry for\u201d and her for not picking up he didn\u2019t get the true meaning of sorry. \u2026 or the guy, even if not on purpose, was extra difficult in this situation and that upset her. If my partner would choose to die on a hill this minor, the same day I got robbed and was feeling down, I\u2019d also be less cheerful.  Unless she has a history of being self centred and overly needy, then I could see why that would struck a nerve with him. But he didn\u2019t bring any such thing up, so it honestly made me think he might be on the autism spectrum. He seems confused and taking words too literally, that\u2019s a common source of conflict for ppl with autism.", "This", "She wanted emotional support. He tried to avoid giving it to her by offering her financial support, which she did not request. \n\nIf someone says they need a hug and you hand them a $100 bill, it isn\u2019t a nice thing to do.", "So do you not tell someone sorry for your loss?", "So wouldn't it be E S H?\n\nYou said she is taking her frustration out on the OP, but he's still the a-hole?", "You're mad. \n\nShe had zero right to yell at him for not saying a specific word. He showed his support and sympathy with his actions rather than his words. She demanded special words because that was apparently more important than actually moving forward.", "Soo gf yelling after he offered to cover her trip and found actual practical solution is warranted? Lol he should take away that offer and fly back home, what a ridiculous thing to yell at your partner for.", "Yea but didn\u2019t he express his sympathy by offering help and care instead of just saying the magic word. Like does no one else here think it\u2019s weird she was keeping count \u201ceveryone else said sorry but you didn\u2019t\u201d yea cause he just offered to pay the rest of the way how much more sympathy could one need ?", "Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s also extremely childish to walk around upset and keeping track of who did and didn\u2019t say sorry for your problem ? Like he offered a solution way better then any \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d could give", "So the gf is in the clear for yelling at OP because SHE got robbed? I understand her frustration, but your judgment is a load of shit.\n\nShe got robbed, but it's OK to yell at OP. It's OK to treat someone else like shit if something bad happens to you?", "How have you gotten to the age where you\u2019d rather hear empty platitudes than viable solutions? Instead of saying empty words, he showed his concern by offering to cover the rest of the trip.\n\nIt is like all of those people posting \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d on their social media without actually doing anything to help out.", "I think she meant sorry as in \u201coh I\u2019m sorry this happened to you\u201d \n\nNot an apology asking for forgiveness. \n\nSimilar to when someone old passes away who you didn\u2019t know and you say \u201cSorry for your loss\u201d you aren\u2019t really sorry.its just the nice thing to do.\n\nBut she is fucking dramatic and this is probably a red flag \ud83d\ude02", "Wtf are you talking about?", "What. The. Fuck.", "Idk man. If someone offered to cover the rest of my trip due to me losing my money. That\u2019s better then any \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened\u201d that fixes nothing ?", "What are you going on about. It\u2019s a \u201chormone\u201d thing. No it\u2019s not. How can somebody be so close to getting it and just miss the point complexity. Are you an red piller? Yuck", "Imagine if women left comments like \u201cthis is a classic conflict with men because are far less intelligent due to their hormones. Men are incapable of empathy biologically, they pick fights because their hormones make them aggressive\u201d. Ridiculous.", "Yeah, I gotta say it\u2019s a a little semantic pet peeve of mine when something unfortunate happens to someone and I say \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened to you\u201d and they say \u201cdon\u2019t be sorry it\u2019s not your fault\u201d like I wasn\u2019t trying to take any blame here lol just expressing sympathy \n\nThe gf is definitely overreacting though.", "He covered her for the rest of the trip, that\u2019s good enough. He could have said sorry too but the monetary coverage was a bigger deal than a couple words. ESH is definitely applicable", "Yes, you are right. I thought I implied that at the end of my post, but I will change it.", "You have a weird anger towards women or something? Considering something had happened to her that day and she was upset, it isn\u2019t the wildest thing for her to yell. Also couples fight. Being yelled at isn\u2019t nice but Ita not abuse. They are adults. We don\u2019t know what he considers yelling, was she narrating him, or just upset. All we know is that it was a unnecessary argument but he was the one who didn\u2019t budge on a pretty minor thing.", "But why? We have card machines in Europe. I don\u2019t think anyone recommends carrying that amount of cash on them these days.", "Yea it\u2019s almost like she made a conflict out of nothing when he was helping. She wants to be verbally stroked and he wants to actually solve her problem and is getting nothing but flack.", "No, and you shouldn't either. You *offer your condolences*, which is entirely different. Saying \"im sorry\" is an immediate implication of guilt over the fact.", "I also said she\u2019s an asshole for being dramatic. He\u2019s the asshole for just not saying he\u2019s sorry for what she is going through. \n\nHave you ever lost a wallet? It sucks.", "Considering the fact she was robbed that day and he was stubborn. It\u2019s not. We don\u2019t know how this fight looked. Her yelling could have been just having an upset tone. He didn\u2019t mention her being degrading. Would you rather she didn\u2019t bring it up and just broke up with him? Fighting is normal in adult relationships. Are you even an adult?", "I'm on the NTA side. OP stepped up and offered to cover costs. He's now the bad guy because she got robbed and he didn't say sorry. \n\nThe gf is now using OP as a punching bag. Her trip got ruined so now he needs to be punished for it.", "Yeah that\u2019s the weirdest part. She kept count of the \u201csorry\u2019s\u201d like she was stacking them but how many of them offered her money? How many offered to pay for her trip?", "Yeah, my best friend does that a lot, to which i say \"yeah, but im still sorry it happened\". But to be fair we've got another friend who apologizes for everything under the sun which gets really exhausting.", "Someone said that to me once and I immediately thought less of them for taking a sincere expression of condolence and turning it into an idiotic semantic game. \n\nThe gf is overreacting here, but the OP also sounds exhausting to be around.", "You implied the gf was also an a-hole, but the acronyms matter. Sorry for being pedantic. I just don't like how anyone is insinuating that OP is wrong for getting yelled at. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful weekend.", "For the wedding gift", "You seem to feel see yourself as a victim. Stop projecting your insecurities on strangers", "So if you are saying they are both assholes, it's everyone sucks here (E S H).\n\nI am calling your judgment into question. If OP is the Y T A, but his gf also is, it's not Y T A. It's E S H.", "Ok.", "Just read the rules of this subreddit! It's not hard unless you are 6 years old or illiterate.", "\u2026.ok", "Yea, your response is the same way I reacted to the comment above.", "To be honest I\u2019ve seen ESH and had no idea what it meant and it didn\u2019t even occur to me to look at the rules and find out that there is an easier way to let everyone know they suck.\n\nThat person needs to calm down it is not that serious\u2026 it\u2019s Reddit."]}
