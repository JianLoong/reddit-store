You are not obligated to invite all members of a family to a party. It's only polite for parents to ask before bringing uninvited siblings to a party (and it's fine to ask - just like it is fine for you to say \"no\"). And it was extremely rude for this mother to just show up with the siblings in tow. I'm guessing that she was thinking \"it's easier to apologize than to ask for permission.\" But you only had so much space and money for so many kids, and if you had let this mother stay with her extra kids, you would have opened up the door to other parents showing up with extra kids in the future. And you had better bet that the parents who said you should had let them stay were thinking just that.\n\nYou were absolutely fine. Don't let this woman guilt trip you for her bad behavior.", "Most definitely NTA.  This was a  big issue when we had parties for younger son.  I'd  book a venue with a headcount (think bowling alley or jumpee place) and there was always [that.one.family](https://that.one.family) that would show up with multiple kids in tow and expect the siblings to be included for free.  \n\nThey know \\*exactly\\* what they are doing and are banking that you are too \\*nice\\* to show them to the door.  In reality, these people have the hides of rhinos, so are immune to the hurty fwweewings and have absolutely no shame.\n\nSecond time, I told free loader mom that we had no room for siblings and to give me her cell number so I  could call her when party was winding down and she could pick up \\*invited\\* child.  She sputtered a bit, but backed down.    \n\nThe awkwardness is all theirs to own and deal with.  Leaving kids at home, um, hello, second parent?  Child care arrangements?  Part of the parenting territory. Not your problem to solve.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and you aren't required to adjust your ability to accommodate for the whims of others.", "NTA - I feel like the fact that she didn't ask beforehand meant like she was going to bring all her kids no matter what. You're not obligated to accommodate someone else's poor planning.", "NTA.  You had planned for a certain number of people, having extra show up doesn't work.  You may not have enough food or goodie bags or whatever.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why parents do that. Only one child was invited cause only one child is friends with your daughter. You didn\u2019t invite the whole family.", "NTA, however, for future parties, probably wise to say upfront that it's a small gathering and no other kids welcome unless invited, since I can understand the other person's frustration.", "Nta. Does it make it harder for some families?. Yes. Is that your responsibility? No. The reality is not every situation can be prefect.", "NTA. I would never assume it\u2019s OK to bring additional children to a party when the invitation is addressed to one specific child. Especially when you went out of your way to indicate, there was only room for one parent. I hope she learns her lesson and is courteous enough to inquire in advance for future parties. But to avoid future issues you might have to actually write on the invitation that you were unable to accommodate siblings.", "NTA\nI once dropped my eldst off for a birthday party and my youngest was crying her eyes out because she couldn\u2019t go in. \nBut that is the way it is. Siblings are induviduals and can\u2019t always go together.", "NTA, I bet the mum was trying her luck. You set boundaries and she tried to ignore them. You stuck to them. \n\nIf you allowed all the kids to stay it would have been unfair to the ones that couldn't go and would also send the message that emotional blackmail is ok.", "NTA you set the rules as where you daughters wishes for her birthday and some people where not going to be able to make it or abide by that but it was not your responsibility to worry over other peoples kids. some people could make it some people couldn't that's all.", "NTA. Ah yes, the classic \u201cshow up with an uninvited entourage and act surprised when it\u2019s not cool.\u201d It\u2019s not a buy-one-get-three-free deal. You set clear boundaries and communicated them. It's not a pop-up playdate; it's a planned party. The audacity to just assume her whole brood can crash and then get miffy when corrected? Priceless. Some parents left their other kids at home, so why does this mom get to rewrite the guest list? Stick to your guns. Your house isn\u2019t a drop-in center.", "NTA that's a huge ask on the part of the other parent and she knew it", "NTA. It would have been one thing had she asked, but she needs to be aware parties are planned with a specific number of kids in mind so everyone can have food and a goodie bag or what not. This gave you no opportunity to be a good host, only the choice between alienating them or being a bad host.", "NTA and I hate when parents do that. One mom in my youngest\u2019s class is notorious for doing that and tried to pull that sh*T on me at my kid\u2019s party. It was at a place with mini golf, bowling, etc so I got a set number of kids. Not paying for your uninvited kids.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't have the authority to invite her other children to your party without your permission. She should have asked you beforehand.\n\nIt's a lose lose situation for you: Letting her other kids stay would've been unfair to all the other parents of multiple children, and making her leave would only make her upset. \n\nYou made a good decision, and don't let anyone else make you feel guilty or tell you otherwise.", "NTA, though as others have said, perhaps better to specify that it's a small gathering up front. Can understand the perspective of the lady though, especially if it wasn't clear to her beforehand.", "NTA- that mom was too entitled.", "NTA. When we get party invitations for my kids, when I RSVP, I always ask if siblings are welcome. When hosting a party, I ask parents if they are bringing siblings. If it's at our home or a park, the more the merrier. If it's at a paid location, I tell parents siblings are welcome to come, but they will need to pay for the activity. Most parents are super open to that. \n\nFor me personally, I always ask because I want to make sure we have food/party favor bags. I'd hate for a kid to feel bad about not getting the same as the other kids.\n\nIt can be super awkward to ask (as a party host and a party goer), but totally worth it.", "NTA , she probably knew she shoukdnt have come with all her kids. But did anyway hoping you would jsut allow it. Well done for sticking ur ground. It isnt their kids birthdays its OPs kids birthday :)", "NTA. It\u2019s rude of her to assume she could invite other guests (her other kids) to your daughter\u2019s party.", "I completely fail to understand why an 8 year old can't be dropped off. Like, honestly, I'm mystified. They go to school every day without their parents, and have done for a few years by 8. Maybe sports / music / dance etc too. And surely if something goes wrong and they need to go then the parent can be called? Genuinely perplexed here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is obviously against the grain, but I'm leaning more towards YTA. \n\nWas there really no possible way to accommodate an extra three little kids? I think sometimes people can stand to be slightly less rigid and a tiny bit more flexible/understanding, especially in a situation like this. Was the awkwardness and hurt feelings really worth kicking this little family out of a *child's birthday party?*  It's not like it was a formal wedding or something.\n\nI know it's unpopular, but personally, I would have just let them stay. Birthday parties are supposed to be lighthearted and fun.", "Shoulda let them so it wouldn't be awkward for everyone.", "NTA - she didn't even RSVP properly. \n\nI don't understand people who are all worried about dropping kids off at birthday parties either. Is it because people don't know the parents anymore? I also think it's wild to assume siblings would be invited to begin with.", "NTA \n\nYou had a limited space and if you'd let them stay you would have gotten blowback for the parents who were told sibs not able to stay.  \n\nYou made it clear, they made it awkward.", "Yeah, I\u2019ll do that from now on, but I also think it\u2019s wildly rude to see an invite addressed to one person and think you can just bring the whole family. It\u2019s a little wild to me to be frustrated when you\u2019ve brought a bunch of people and didn\u2019t even ask about it. It feels super different from when I was a kid lol.", "Really?  Every Birthday party our kids have had or attended had named invites.\n\nI could see confusion around cousins, but not straight-up \"invited my friend from school\" and they show up with the balance of their family.  \n\nThat's freaking weird, and I cannot understand the person's frustration.", "I had a few of those moments in my childhood too, usually when my sibling was going somewhere super fun. \u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t also go ice skating/bowling/to the movies?!??!\u201d Lol", "It\u2019s super wild to me that someone would try to pull that at a paid place! Like I kind of get it because it was at my home, so it\u2019s ultimately less expensive than a bowling alley or something similar. \n\nIt just feels so so different from when I was a kid 20ish years ago. I feel like when I went to parties in public places parents would occasionally bring siblings and be in the same place but not participate in the party and that was still considered borderline weird.", "Yeah based on the comments/this incident I\u2019ll definitely specify in the future, but I can\u2019t understand her perspective since to me it\u2019s should be clear enough when you get an invitation addressed to a specific child. The invite wasn\u2019t to the \u201cSmith Family\u201d but to \u201cErica Smith\u201d so it really boggles my mind why anyone would think it was an open invitation for the whole family at all lol", "NTA I would never assume siblings are invited. If they are it will be spelled out. If I send out an invite it has the kid\u2019s name who is invited, only. If siblings are welcome it says \u201csiblings welcome\u201d. That\u2019s how everyone I know does it to not cause issues. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d ever assume of even ask otherwise.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t ask because we weren\u2019t accommodating sibling for space reasons and also per my kids wishes, but in the future I guess I\u2019ll put it on the invite in advance", "What if each family brought 2 extra kids each?  Where does it end?", "There were two main reasons for it\n\n1.) When my Maddy and I talked about the party she did say that she didn\u2019t want all the \u201cbabies/little kids\u201d there. I guess there have been some incidents at other parties where siblings have been a problem and done things like try to open gifts/blow out candles or wrecked a party decoration. I don\u2019t know if it was these kids or others so it felt more fair to say no across the board to sibling. \n\n2.) Other parents did ask and were told no. Some of those parents had arranged childcare and were at the party with their kids. TBH I didn\u2019t feel like explaining why *these* kids were staying. Like it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal if it was only those kids, but if everyone who asked had brought siblings it would have been a huge problem. \n\nI did feel really bad for the friend who was actually invited. She was more than welcome to stay without her mom, but her mom wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. (Which I completely understand as we don\u2019t know each other well and it\u2019s a messed up world)", "I mean, it would have been really awkward with all the parents who were there who had asked to bring siblings that I said no to", ">it\u2019s wildly rude to see an invite addressed to one person and think you can just bring the whole family\n\nIt is. And frankly, you\u2019re under no obligation to indulge either her failure to make childcare arrangements or her failure to manage her anxiety about drop-off parties appropriately or her desire to freeload and rely on other people being too nice to push back against the entitlement. Don\u2019t listen to anyone who thinks you should have made *her* ineptitudes or entitlement your problems to solve. NTA.", "Oh, definitely is rude. Sadly, I've seen it happen, too.   The people that do it I think have a bully mentality and think if they push the issue no one will push back. \n\nFortunately, my kids don't usually want to invite more than one or two friends, so it's a non-issue for us.", "Definitely, and since you had 3 extra kids, things like goodie bags or small prizes would become an issue.", "You shouldn't have to specify that siblings aren't invited. I can't imagine bringing all six of my children to a party that only one was invited to attend.  I would not even think to call and ask if I could.  That is so rude.", "That's the exact kind of birthday parties I grew up with, so I'm kind of biased. We invited our entire classrooms and their families to our birthday parties, and it was always the more the merrier. Nobody was ever turned away. Those days are obviously gone, though, and now everyone seems to be a lot more rigid. It is what it is.", "> *\"TBH I didn\u2019t feel like explaining why these kids were staying.*\"\n\nWho would you have had to explain it to? I have never, in my entire life, been to a kid's birthday party where people were questioning the guest list. \n\nI mean, I get it, you didn't want to break the rules you had set in place, but sometimes I think we make things a much bigger deal than they really need to be. In the end, I would have just accepted that this person made a faux pas due to not understanding the rules, but would have let them stay anyway to avoid embarrassing them. That's just me, though.", "Idk, imo kicking people out is more awkward.", "Like I said there were other parents actively at the party who had arranged childcare who I didn\u2019t want to explain myself to. Even if they didn\u2019t make a fuss (and some of them are the type to make a fuss, or at least be make a snide remark when they were leaving) I would have felt like I had to because it wasn\u2019t fair to them.", "These kids will probably be invited for years to come so it's probably best to nip this kind of freeloading in the bud. If they could stay then next time others might try to skirt the rules as well. Yes it's a bit more awkward now in the direct aftermath but long-term it's definitely the better solution", "> *\"Like I said there were other parents actively at the party who had arranged childcare who I didn\u2019t want to explain myself to.\"*\n\nSo, they actually asked you to explain yourself to them? Did you also have to explain to them why the other two little siblings were there?", "I actually did explain the other siblings in advance when they called and asked about if siblings could come because I didn\u2019t want anyone getting upset when they saw them there, especially because some of them had kids the same age as my other daughter. \n\nAnd like I said in the comment you replied to, I felt that they WOULD ask or make comments had I let the other kids stay. We will never know for sure if they would have because I said they couldn\u2019t. I do however feel fairly confident I know these parents better than you do.", "> *\"I do however feel fairly confident I know these parents better than you do.\"*\n\nWell, lucky you, I guess? I wouldn't be particularly happy to have friends who put me on edge as much as this and who make me feel like I better be able to explain every move I decide to make or else I'll be in trouble with them, but to each their own."]}
