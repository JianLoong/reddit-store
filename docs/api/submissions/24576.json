And it was extremely rude for this mother to just show up with the siblings in tow. I'm guessing that she was thinking \"it's easier to apologize than to ask for permission.\" But you only had so much space and money for so many kids, and if you had let this mother stay with her extra kids, you would have opened up the door to other parents showing up with extra kids in the future.

In reality, these people have the hides of rhinos, so are immune to the hurty fwweewings and have absolutely no shame.\n\nSecond time, I told free loader mom that we had no room for siblings and to give me her cell number so I  could call her when party was winding down and she could pick up \\*invited\\* child.  She sputtered a bit, but backed down.    \n\nThe awkwardness is all theirs to own and deal with.  Leaving kids at home, um, hello, second parent?  Child care arrangements?  Part of the parenting territory. Not your problem to solve.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house and you aren't required to adjust your ability to accommodate for the whims of others.", "NTA - I feel like the fact that she didn't ask beforehand meant like she was going to bring all her kids no matter what. You're not obligated to accommodate someone else's poor planning.", "NTA.  You had planned for a certain number of people, having extra show up doesn't work.  You may not have enough food or goodie bags or whatever.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why parents do that. Only one child was invited cause only one child is friends with your daughter. You didn\u2019t invite the whole family.", "NTA, however, for future parties, probably wise to say upfront that it's a small gathering and no other kids welcome unless invited, since I can understand the other person's frustration.", "Nta. Does it make it harder for some families?. Yes. Is that your responsibility? No. The reality is not every situation can be prefect.", "NTA. I would never assume it\u2019s OK to bring additional children to a party when the invitation is addressed to one specific child. Especially when you went out of your way to indicate, there was only room for one parent. I hope she learns her lesson and is courteous enough to inquire in advance for future parties.

Ah yes, the classic \u201cshow up with an uninvited entourage and act surprised when it\u2019s not cool.\u201d It\u2019s not a buy-one-get-three-free deal. You set clear boundaries and communicated them. It's not a pop-up playdate; it's a planned party. The audacity to just assume her whole brood can crash and then get miffy when corrected? Priceless. Some parents left their other kids at home, so why does this mom get to rewrite the guest list? Stick to your guns. Your house isn\u2019t a drop-in center.", "NTA that's a huge ask on the part of the other parent and she knew it", "NTA.

One mom in my youngest\u2019s class is notorious for doing that and tried to pull that sh*T on me at my kid\u2019s party. It was at a place with mini golf, bowling, etc so I got a set number of kids. Not paying for your uninvited kids.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't have the authority to invite her other children to your party without your permission. She should have asked you beforehand.\n\nIt's a lose lose situation for you: Letting her other kids stay would've been unfair to all the other parents of multiple children, and making her leave would only make her upset. \n\nYou made a good decision, and don't let anyone else make you feel guilty or tell you otherwise.", "NTA, though as others have said, perhaps better to specify that it's a small gathering up front. Can understand the perspective of the lady though, especially if it wasn't clear to her beforehand.", "NTA- that mom was too entitled.", "NTA. When we get party invitations for my kids, when I RSVP, I always ask if siblings are welcome. When hosting a party, I ask parents if they are bringing siblings. If it's at our home or a park, the more the merrier. If it's at a paid location, I tell parents siblings are welcome to come, but they will need to pay for the activity. Most parents are super open to that. \n\nFor me personally, I always ask because I want to make sure we have food/party favor bags.

Your 8 year old has a full right to request that her birthday party be a big kid party for her and her school aged friends, and you were very fair in allowing a couple siblings to entertain your 6 year old too.

My family made a point to have me throw a birthday party each year with just a gaggle of girls with no boys allowed and to let me have something to celebrate where I wasn\u2019t so outnumbered for once. Once kids get to be well into elementary school like this, it\u2019s pricier and a lot more intense to handle that many kids, it isn\u2019t like 5 and under birthdays where it\u2019s normal for entire families of siblings to be included and invited. Parents need to stop being stuck in their view of parenting toddlers and accept that as their kids and other kids have their own voice, choice and autonomy.. it doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets to come anymore.", "I was 1 of 4 kids when I was young before getting adopted.

In some circles, it's obvious to everyone that siblings are invited too. In others, it's unheard of. For some people, it also varies by age and age of the siblings and other factors. For me, I always thought the kids who showed up without their siblings were odd, I sometimes took it as a sign their parents don't like us. I also expected to see some people show up with random extra kids like their neighbour who was hanging out that day, the cousin visiting for the weekend, the friend's kid they're babysitting, etc. I understand that it would be total pandemonium to behave like that in some (mostly white?) families. \n\nMiscommunication is common and you will see more of it as your kids get older. Learning to be clear and forthcoming with details will help you avoid all kinds of uncomfortable situations. Start from the perspective that everyone is doing their best and that no one's approach is necessarily better or more obvious.", "The only thing I would allow as not rude is a parent staying with their kid and they have a baby.  Babies with their mom is often accepted as necessary and that's more understandable as long as the mom is watchful and considerate.  Not siblings old enough to stay home with a babysitter or other parent.", "It\u2019s definitely different. No one drops off and everyone brings siblings.

But a lot of kids go to party places where the parents have to pay by the head--and a lot of times there's a limit on how many kids you can have period. Of if there's a theme and there's specific activities, then again, there may not be enough for everyone. I always made sure there was at least one extra everything at my daughter's parties in case a sibling showed up.

Good for us. We should all be very proud."]}
