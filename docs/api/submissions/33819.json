I've never asked for outrageously extravagant or expensive things, but every year she asks me for a list or at least a specific item or two that I want for Christmas, and she NEVER gets me any of the things I ask for. One year the one and only thing I asked for was season 5 of Merlin on DVD. I had every other season, that was the only one I wanted, and I said I'd be happy for that to be my only Christmas gift.

Something very simple and cheap, but it would have meant the world to me to know that my mom (who never heard me play and is always surprised that I already played at several recitals and that I am part of an ensemble) acknowledge my passion and somehow put a tiny bit of effort in it to support me. Instead, she doubled the effort and costs to buy me a sweatshirt and pants that are neither my style nor do they fit because \"she didn't know what to buy and they are more useful\".\nAnd that hurts. I have a toddler, I am pregnant, have ADHD, work and study, and I still manage every year to gift everyone  something they actually asked for for Christmas or their birthday.

That's the only thing that makes the gift important. I also knew how much it crushed her when we couldn't afford Christmas one year. Her being so worried that I would need the gifts for it to be Christmas crushed me. I didn't care at all. I only cared about two things.

It was like $30, and yeah if that\u2019s the one thing you kid asked for and you forgot it than they are allowed to be disappointed you aren\u2019t owed a positive reaction when giving gifts, but there\u2019s also a difference between hey this is to much money and I literally forgot about what you wanted, why are you upset let me thrown money at you and tell you all the other shit I do for you, you remembered what your kid wanted", "A difference of opinion is not gaslighting.", "I agree. It's all about the recipient. However EXPECTING  someone to give you something specific is unreasonable. Every gift I give I aim to cater to the likes/dislikes, wants and needs of the person I am gifting. I pay attention to the things they talk about and mention. In my family we have a personal list we update as needed. Things like scents and flavors we love/hate, interests, things we collect, things we have finished collecting, sizing ect. We too add specific items of interest but NO ONE expects to receive them.", "And if she does do a lot for hm? Why are you so sure he's not a brat?", "Where in this post did you read that he is still living with his parents and doesn't have a job?", "He wanted freaking sports cards. He got everything else except the one thing that is cheap and easy to get, but he cares for. Why did they care more for all the other gifts they got for him, and that probably cost way more than effing sports cards?! Maybe because they don't value his feelings as much as their idea of a good gift? \nHe didn't ask for anything else that Christmas. But I promise you that if he made a post about his parents sending him to the store to get napkins and he comes home with all the groceries except the napkins he would be the ahole for not paying attention. And no, he wouldn't make it right for getting the napkins right away because they wouldn't need them anymore. \nTheir  son offered them such an easy way to make a great gift. And again: If you have a \"no gifts for adult children \n\" policy, that's totally fine  but you need to discuss it BEFORE Christmas day. They went all the way just to gift him things he didn't want. If you don't understand that they disregarded his feelings, please think again.", "I mean you should be getting the gifts people want.", "I understand what you mean. I don't get gifts from family as an adult, but no gifts is better than being asked what you want and being given something completely different and being told they forgot what you wanted, in that case, why even ask?", "You are owed a thank you for the gift and for the person to move on. Not a tantrum. Again, no one owes you a gift.", "No it isn\u2019t but saying you can\u2019t feel a certain type of way because I do all this for you is\u2026\n\nGaslight in it\u2019s simplest form is convincing someone their reality isn\u2019t what it is, by telling OP you aren\u2019t able to or shouldn\u2019t react a certain way is warping his reality because you can\u2019t tell people how to feel or react, have you every been gaslighted? You gave a very narrow example which is a true example but it\u2019s one of a million", "I suspect what he wanted is for his parents to do exactly what you just said you do. You *pay attention*. You don't disregard your giftee so thoroughly that you don't retain in your mind the one single thing they told you would make them happy. You care about making your giftee happy.\n\nNo one who gives a shit about their kid forgets the one single thing he expresses desire for on the biggest gift giving, family appreciating holiday of the year. The entire point is to show you care. They failed to do that.", "Judging by his comments I'm starting to think he's the son.", "Well it sounds like he has parents who love him, and in today's economy, any loving parents would be keeping their kids at home as long as possible rather than forcing them out to pay rent.  But this guy is a spoiled brat, so OP should stop loving him and live as if they have no son.", "Unfortunately we don\u2019t always get what we want, it\u2019s life. His parents didn\u2019t have to get him anything but they did. Once his parents realized their blunder they tried to remedy it, which again , they didn\u2019t have to do. There are people who don\u2019t get any gifts, he is not one of those people and he is lucky for that. And if you don\u2019t think he is entitled or ungrateful please think again.", "Agreed. Although I\u2019ve noticed that we are all assuming here that the parents are chronically neglectful. We could just as easily assume that this was a one time mistake on the parents part. We definitely need more info!", "No it isn\u2019t.\n\nTelling someone their behaviour is wrong is not gaslighting, sorry. And no I\u2019m not gaslighting you by saying you\u2019re wrong either.", "I don't think there is enough information to come to that conclusion.", "Yeah I wouldn't be surprised \ud83d\ude02", "So he should be grateful because his parents do the bare minimum \n\nNot throwing your kid out when they turn 18 is the least you can do as a parent", "I hope you don't procreate.", "Your delusional", "I think the reason why those assumptions are being made is the vagueness of the post and lack of replies or clarifications. It's possible it was a one time thing, and it's possible that maybe the dude is spoiled, but it doesn't read that way.", "People are asking the questions not assuming. You are assuming!", "I didn\u2019t say you would lol, but gaslighting is about convincing someone their reality isn\u2019t real, it can be in any form, trying to convince someone their feeling aren\u2019t real or are invalid because you did your job as a parent is gaslighting, you can stomp you feet and say no but that is reality if you took it to a therapist they would saying it gaslighting, I know it happened to me and guess what the therapist said\u2026 I was being gaslighted, what you said is true, but so is what I\u2019m saying, both can be true at the same time", "Also I didn\u2019t say that correcting behaviour is gaslighting I said convincing someone their reality isn\u2019t real is, so your either purposely missing the point or your so convinced you right you can\u2019t see past to reason", "He expressed desire for a thing. One thing. Uno. They forgot what the single thing was and bought random other shit instead. These are facts as presented by OP. How can you forget the one single thing someone wants if you care about them? There's no information in the world that could justify this.", "The least you can do as a parent is nothing; completely neglect your kid and let them die.  And also yourself because you weren't eating; you were doing literally nothing."]}
