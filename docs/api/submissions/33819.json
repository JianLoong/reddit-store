However, he's not entirely wrong for being upset if he only had one thing on his list and you didn't get it.\n\nFrom personal experience; my own mother is notoriously bad for doing this. I've never asked for outrageously extravagant or expensive things, but every year she asks me for a list or at least a specific item or two that I want for Christmas, and she NEVER gets me any of the things I ask for. One year the one and only thing I asked for was season 5 of Merlin on DVD. I had every other season, that was the only one I wanted, and I said I'd be happy for that to be my only Christmas gift. She literally said \"I don't want to buy you that\" and instead bought me lots of little gifts instead (things like hand lotion sets, soaps, earring packs, etc.) So, for the last few years, whenever she asks what I want, I just shrug and say anything will do. Because I've learned there's no point with her. It's annoying but I've learned that that's just how she is. I'm not going to cause an argument with her about it but I understand your sons annoyance if that's the only thing he said he wanted.", "YTA", "Depends on how the request for the cards was made.  \n\nIf you asked if there was anything he wanted, got the answer and then forgot, that\u2019s AH territory.\n\nIf he told you unprompted that\u2019s what he wanted/expected from you, he\u2019s the entitled AH (but at 22, OP needs  some self reflection to figure out why that\u2019s the case).", "This.

It's about his parents forgetting the one thing he really cared about, and  offering to order them now makes it even worse. He could order them by himself, but they completely destroyed the sentimental value those cards had for him. And asking for sports cards screams to me that this man cares more about the sentiments than any monetary gift, something his parents totally undermined.

Their adult son is lucky they offered to order them for him after the fact. I'm 23 and asked for headphones for christmas. Had my parents forgotten or chosen not to get them for me for some reason I would simply have thanked them for what I did get and ordered the headphones for myself.", "You're 28 and would throw a shit fit if your mommy didn't get your baseball cards for Christmas?", "But he's 22, he can buy them himself. The parents immediately apologised and tried to make it up to him, and he acted like a five year old. OP and their husband would be really stressed around this time, getting gift for other people as well. I get that the son was disappointed but the way he reacted was pretty childish, soft ESH.", "Nope, they don't fix anything. If someone asks for such a \"cheap\" gift, you can bet that this spefici gift has a high sentimental value for that person if they get it from the person they ask it from. For me, it was sheet music for the violin. Very, very cheap (I didn't ask for something fancy or specific, just something like beginner friendly music like disney songs, Christmas songs, or anything like that) just because it would mean that my family acknowledge a passion of mine (I started as an adult, and they constantly forget about it. My mother was surprised that having a recital isn't something new for me). Instead, I got a sweatshirt and pants that don't fit and are way, way more expensive. They said \"we didn't know what to get you and this one seems more useful\". I am an adult. I can get a new sweatshirt that fits and sheet music I like anytime I want. But getting them from my family would have meant so much to me, and it really hurt that they ignored it (and that they even forgot to take off any price tag). And no, ordering them later would have meant nothing and made it worse. \n\nEveryone forgets something, and it's an honest mistake.

I bet their son didn\u2019t have those things on his mind. Adults know that you can reschedule special events, including birthdays and Christmas, as needed.

Rightfully so. \n\nYTA.", "This isn't about the monetary value but the sentimental value. And Christmas should be about the wants and not the needs. Also, he cared for one thing, and they forgot about it. I can tell you from my own experience that it hurts like shit, especially as an adult (because you know...there are some dudes on the Internet telling you you act like an entitled toddler just because you feel disappointed at Christmas day. Apparently, we are not allowed to feel the way we feel when we are older than 16).", "I think they did say in their post that they apologized and offered to order them for him. We have no idea how long ago their son asked for these cards or who else the parents were shopping for, or if they had other things going on. The son seems entitled", "I bet all the gifts they made were very expensive and he didn't care for one of them because getting some sports cards from his parents (ans knowing that they remembered and cared) would have had a much higher (sentimental) value than anything else. It hurts so, so much if your parents or partner does something like that, and offering to order it right away makes it even worse.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d. But the issue is that the thought wasn\u2019t of the one thing he asked for.", "We are talking about freaking sports cards. Unless we are talking about something completely different, that's a very small issue if you don't have an agreement not to get any gifts for adult kids (and yes, that's something you need to discuss before Christmas day). He asked for something that has a sentimental value for him if he gets it from his parents, for whatever reason. I had a similar wish (sheet music for  violin, nothing fancy and very, very cheap) just to know that my family acknowledged a passion of mine. Instead, I got a sweatshirt and pants that don't fit me (and cost at least twice as much) because they thought it would be more useful. I can tell you that it hurts.", "Yes he could by them himself, but they asked him what he wanted and didn't even get him something close, in fact it was the only thing he asked for.\n\nYes he behaved childishly, but the parents are still the AH", "They had one job to do for their son. They had too much on their plate to care for the one thing he asked for? So, why not getting rid of the things he didn't ask for and do the most important thing for him first? \n\nI asked my family for violin sheet music.  Something very simple and cheap, but it would have meant the world to me to know that my mom (who never heard me play and is always surprised that I already played at several recitals and that I am part of an ensemble) acknowledge my passion and somehow put a tiny bit of effort in it to support me. Instead, she doubled the effort and costs to buy me a sweatshirt and pants that are neither my style nor do they fit because \"she didn't know what to buy and they are more useful\".\nAnd that hurts. I have a toddler, I am pregnant, have ADHD, work and study, and I still manage every year to gift everyone  something they actually asked for for Christmas or their birthday. If you want to talk about respect: They also need to respect the feelings of their son. And please don't act like a 22yo can't have things on his mind, and his parents are justified and allowed to mess up just because they are older. They messed up, and they still don't realise that ordering the cards now wouldn't change a thing.", "He's also an adult.", "AH might be a bit strong for what they did though.", "Adults are allowed to be disappointed.", "And adults lose the right to be disappointed? \nI get big \u201ebe thankful we gave birth to you\u201c vibes. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if there is/was no clear communication. But there was. The only thing he cared about was forgotten. He feels not seen. And he wasn\u2019t. \n\nI don\u2019t want/need presents the other person likes or think are useful. Gifting is about what the gifted person wants/needs. Other than that you can just let it be.", "Well, I don't have kids, so you aren't getting \"big...be thankful\" vibes from me.  I'm just grateful for gifts in general.  Like...I appreciate that someone thought of me.  I'm severely allergic to nuts and have gotten peanut chocolates for holidays.  I don't even care.  I think it's nice they thought of me.  I'm not greedy."]}
