That dust gets everywhere, and a lot of your stuff is probably just ruined. They needed to clear that room out before they demo'd the wall, not just partially cover up the bed with plastic.", "NTA. Your mom sounds super nice/s.", "NTA. This is truly thoughtless and disrespectful. I presume they never thought there would be quite so much dust, and are now in a self-defense mode of 'well, it's OUR house and we can wreck things if we want to', but deep down they know they screwed up.", "NTA...they most definitely should have cleared your room & if that wasn't possible...covered everything in plastic tarps. \nI grew up with my father always working in our home remodeling something! He is a contractor~so he knows what to do...but still...there was still dust when he worked on a room or ceiling etc...\nWhen ur parents saw what was happening in ur room...they should have stopped & covered up your things the best they could have...", "NTA. My bf used to work for this wealthy older couple as a handyman. Last year, they bought this nice house that they originally wanted to live in but decided to just flip it. They paid like $2M for it or something. It was a very very gorgeous home, but after buying it they found out that the foundation was cracked. They are older and a little naive. They hired the first person they found to come fix it. Paid him almost $50k. He went into 2 of the rooms and stripped the carpet and everything out down to the foundation and just fixed inside. Unfortunately, he did NOT turn off the central air system or cover anything.  The couple asked my bf and I if we would be willing to come clean up when that guy and his team got finished. It took my bf and I over a week of cleaning every single day and there was still cement/concrete dust everywhere in that house including in all of the pipes for the central air system. It was an absolute nightmare. I felt like they should have hired a professional cleaner who would know how to clean it properly but the couple didn't want to. I would be pretty upset at your parents if I was you.", "Nta for being upset at all. As someone who does a lot of remodeling everything should have been moved or covered. I always move everything that can be moved, but maybe I just think about it because I'm a girl.", "NTA \n\nI hope they know what they're doing with the construction part, at least. It's not very much work to put drop cloths over a work area when it is full of belongings. \n\nThey should be helping to wipe down all your things and wash your fabric goods.", "Nta. Clean up the best you can. If anything is actually damaged or ruined show it to your dad and ask him to replace it. Also ask him to cover cost of any dry cleaning needed due to this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
