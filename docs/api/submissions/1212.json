I also don't understand why he was so upset after I told him the truth. Shouldn't he be relieved if my story was upsetting him so much. It's just weird to me that he got so upset over this when it doesn't affect him at all. Again, I think I have the right to describe my mental health however I choose and he needs to respect that.

What you described literally included hallucinations (not sure if you actually experience them) and comes across like religious psychosis. I would be incredibly worried for your health and safety hearing that, and you should not be leaving people with the impression you believe what you are saying rather than you\u2019re using metaphors to deal with your circumstance.", "YTA.
