My older sisters are Rhea (20f) and Cleo (19f). Our dad died when I was 5 and my sisters were 7 and 8. Mom married our stepdad 13 months after dad died. Our stepdad wanted to adopt us, we didn't want to be adopted, so instead of the adoption mon and stepdad changed our last names from our dad's to our stepdad's and mom said it would give us a family name. My stepdad couldn't have kids so he put a lot of investment in my sisters and me being his kids. He really did try to be our dad too and I know he loves us, but none of us ever wanted his name and my sister's changed their last names back already. Cleo told them after she had her name changed for a while. It was like 2 months ago she told them but she did it more than a year ago and Rhea and I knew about it.\n\nMy mom and stepdad sat me down a couple of weeks ago and told me how much it hurt my stepdad that my sister's had changed their names and mom asked me what I was going to do, since she knows I dislike it as well. My stepdad said he'd like to think we me being 6 when he became my dad, I would like to keep his name in some way, like maybe hyphenate my name or just keep it as just his. I told them I would be changing my last name back to my dad's as well and I didn't want to hyphenate or keep stepdad's last name. I told them I believe it never should have been changed in the first place.\n\nI don't hate my stepdad. I don't think he would have been so insistent on us being his kids and having his name if he could have kids of his own. His pushiness and the way he never took what we felt and wanted into account does bother me. But I also know he has poured a lot into our lives. He paid for the best extra curricular activities, went to every PT conference since he married mom, spent a lot of time with us, trying to be just dad and spoiled us with gifts when we were kids. It's hard because I wish he could have been less focused on being dad and just more focused on having a relationship with us. I know I could at least say I truly love him and might have come to see him as a second dad, though he would never have been my only or main dad. But I always saw him as this pushy family member who put his own wants before ours and put his desires to be a dad onto three kids who already had one they loved.\n\nWhen I said I was changing my name back my stepdad left the room and my mom told me I had been pretty much a baby when he came into my life (I was 6) and that he has raised me for 11 years and has considered me his son from the very first moment and to tell him he's not good enough to consider keeping his name makes me a selfish son. She said our lives are better because of him and he deserves better than the way we have rejected him.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681717353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p6ydu/aita_for_telling_my_mom_and_stepdad_that_ill_be/", "score": 215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister's have already done it and I know both times my stepdad was hurt and maybe even feeling crushed. I knew it would be an even bigger blow for him to hear me say it when I was even younger and I am the last kid who has his name. He made a suggestion that would have been sort of a compromise and I rejected that too. This stuff might make me an asshole because even though I've had my problems with him, he has spent 11 years trying in his own way and I wasn't willing to come up with any kind of compromise for him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He treated you all like you were his kids, spent his money on you guys freely, and he put in the work. He showed up for more in your lives than many biological living parents ever did. \n\nYour mother on the other hand, is very very much the asshole. She was the thread that bounded you all together and yet all she ever did was disrespectfully stomp boundaries instead of help you make clear what ones to follow. She created a bounty of false narratives that hurt both you+siblings  and her husband. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for changing your name back, but a little part of me hopes you understand it wasn\u2019t your stepdad\u2019s fault so much as it was your mother\u2019s fault. She created these false narratives. She emotionally manipulated your stepfather into thinking he could be your dad. She changed your last names and she forced you to give up your own identity.", "NTA \n\nThis \u201cfather replacement\u201d bullshit really pisses me off. My parents were divorced in the 1970s and my mother did everything she could to please her second husband including asking me to call him \u201cDad.\u201d \n\nI went along with it at first because I was a small child, but it hurt my real dad very badly.  After my father died when I was eleven years old I outright refused to call my stepdad \u201cDad\u201d any more and began calling him by his first name. That angered him and he was still mad at me about it when I left home at seventeen. Frankly, it was a power game for that asshole and 40 years later I can see even more clearly what selfish jerks my mother and stepfather were for doing that to me. \n\nI am assuming that your father didn\u2019t choose to die and erasing him was wrong.", "NTA I would have felt like they were trying to erase my dad.", "Tough one here as there's a lot of sentiments and emotions on the stove cooking like mad.\n\nWhere I get that SD has put a lot of effort into the family, I can also understand that you don't want to lose the connection to your biological father. Considering the fact that it takes a lot for any person to \"assume the mantle\" of a parent following loss, I've got respect for the guy for stepping up and doing a best he could. That being said, I don't know the full ins-and-outs of your SD to solidify this, and will not push for that information out of respect.\n\nI think your mom could be a little more understanding, but I'm leaning more to NAH here.", "Woh your mother must have disliked your father a lot.

Stepdad is subtracting something from his names equation and so is your mom which is worse, frankly. And that something is your dad. \nI\u2019m sure he helped you in some important ways. And yet\u2026I loved so much how you phrased your frustration with him: that you wish he could have been less focused on being dad and more focused on having a relationship with you guys. He put the cart before the horse. It would\u2019ve been cool if he could\u2019ve gotten to know you all three of you and showed up for you without making demands all the way through. But he can\u2019t. It\u2019s not who he is. \n\nI am glad you stood up to your mom and him about your name. It would be so much easier to hate him! It\u2019s harder because he\u2019s vulnerable and needy. But that neediness has prevented him from being present and authentic with you and your siblings. And that\u2019s just the truth. Not your fault. And it doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do some really good things for your family. But trust your gut. Pick your name. Stand your ground. NTA.", "Extremely tricky situation where no one is really the arsehole. I think step dad has misread the situation and got over involved emotionally. I have done this myself. You have to understand that the best type of help is the type the receiver wants. I don\u2019t know", "NTA\n\nWhat your name is shouldn't change the relationship you have with your stepdad.  Perhaps he wants to carry on the family name!  Ironically your sisters kids will likely take on their dad's name.  If this is what he wants perhaps mention that you will suggest that any kids you have take on their mothers name.\n\nWhat your mother and stepfather need to realise is that you are an adolescent finding their place in the world.  You want to know what your identity is and part of that is the heritage coming through you from your dad's side.\n\nI know exactly how you feel.  My parents divorced when I was young ie 4 or 5.  A few years later my mother remarried and as part of that she changed our names to be our stepdad's.  We weren't going to argue.. plus I had a hard to spell and hard to pronounce eastern european name so it seemed like it would be good to have an easily spelt and pronounceable english name.\n\nBut as I got older I realised what my mother had done and I was not happy.  I was probably about 15 or so at the time.. maybe a year or two older but also an adolescent like you.\n\nI really wanted to change my name back... but the fallout from my mother would not have been worth it... so when I got married my name was changed to my husbands.  Worse part was that my father was in my life and we saw him every fortnight.  I don't doubt what my mother did hurt my father badly but he never told us how he really felt about it.  He never really bagged my mother out or said much about the relationship and my mother didn't either.  But as we got older, I could easily see why the marriage didn't last... one was super controlling and has undiagnosed mental health issues (no insight and is never wrong in their eyes) and the other is the complete opposite and would just go off and do what they needed with no thought of time and what others need.\n\nBut I digress....  none of this is your fault.  Your mother tried to make your dad disappear for whatever reason.  How your mother and stepfather are currently treating you is not right.  Maybe keep your opinions to yourself at this point until you finish school and then move out for further study or when you get a job.  This is an argument you can't win and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes the elephant in the room which makes interactions with them awkward.\n\nAnd when you have kids... give them your dad's name even if you don't change yours back!", "NTA that was handled by the stepdad and mom long before YOU had a choice.  Now you do and THEY aren't respecting YOUR CHOICES **AGAIN!**", "NTA. Tell them it was selfish of them to take away an integral part of your identity without your consent. \n\nDon't let them make you feel bad and guilt trip you into keeping step-dads name!", "I think the word for this sort of step-parent behaviour should be \u201ctransactional\u201d.\n\nThey\u2019re willing to put parental efforts into the relationship as long as they get what they want out of it. Sadly parenting doesn\u2019t work that way, not even for bio-parents. Parenting is a responsibility that requires effort to be made out of love, with no expectation of anything returned. Commerce is a terrible model for family.", "NTA. Your mother is. She had no right to put you in this situation. Your name came from your bio dad, and she should have respected that. It sounds like she was clinging to the idea of family without thinking of what you'd all gone through. Your stepdad sounds wonderful. Truly. Maybe there is another way you can honour him. But taking his name was wrong. Erasing your dad was the wrong thing to do.", "NTA, they made some massive errors while raising all of you and they\u2019re getting bit in the ass about it now. Your stepdad tried too hard to make the relationship look solid instead of making sure it was solid, and that has led you all to feel that distance instead of the closeness. Even if he did a lot right, not respecting all your boundaries was a critical misstep. I can say my husband is low/no contact with his family, who in many ways were very good parents growing up, because of the exact same issue. You all have every right to be respected as individuals, and that can\u2019t be exchanged for childhood extracurriculars.", "NTA. Changing your surnames after you guys expressed your wish not to be adopted was very selfish. Instead of respecting your decision and empathising with your very natural feelings, they found a way to get what they want. You wanting to keep holding onto whatever is left from your father is not a rejection of your step-father.", "NTA if he truly cared about you and not just about him, he would have respected your wishes instead of sneakily forcing his wishes in an underhanded, backstabbing way. He and your mom forced this upon you without your consent. That's an excellent way to ruin any relationship with a child or adult.", "NTA - your mom and stepdad must realise how much they hurt you and your sisters by forcing you into being his kids. It would not surprise me that if they had not done they you might have considered being adopted by him by the time you where 18 or had asked to use his name or walk you down the isle... He sounds like he has treated you pretty good, but the damage was done already.", "NTA. Pushing and harassing you won't help.", "Edit - changed my mind. NAH. \n\nYour mother should have left your name alone and waited until such as time as you felt you wanted to change it, if you ever did.

He wanted to be a dad, wanted kids, couldn't have his own, so he tried to be that for us. But it was because he wanted to be those things to a kid/kids and what we wanted or felt was never taken into consideration. I know my sister's would have chosen to have nobody else step into the role of a dad for them and for me, I don't know if I would have come to see him as a dad with time.

It's hypocritical, and it's abusive to play slap and tickle with children in this way. **He had a choice.** He could listen to what these children he claims to care about had to say and feel on the topic...or disregard it.  He **chose** to disregard it. \n\ni.e, OP specifically stated: \n\n\\>His pushiness and the way he never took what we felt and wanted into account does bother me.\"\n\nWhen the Step Dad did that, **he sliced off an equal measure of the blame cake**. Now that he has to eat it, while washing it down with a tall cup of his own ego...he's upset. He does not deserve an extent of blame. He gets an equal measure, as a consequence of the choices he made. There are no hairs to split here."]}
