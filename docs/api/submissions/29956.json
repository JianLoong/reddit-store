We have very different disabilities, but the specifics aren't really relevant here.\n\n\r  \nIn our country, there's a program that helps fund \"quality of life\" type stuff for disabled people. Stuff like transportation, physio, social activities, ect. I'm not eligible for this program due to not being a citizen - I migrated as a toddler and applied for citizenship at 18 but was denied because of my health status. Lila uses this program.\n\n\r  \nWe have different life circumstances. I live alone (not by choice), while Lila lives with her parents and does not pay for her own living expenses. We get roughly the same amount of money from pension regardless. \n\n\r  \nLila invited me to an escape room this week and I declined because I can't afford it. She said it was fine and that she understood how hard being poor was because she'd spent over $100 on plushies and couldn't afford to do other activities she wanted before she got paid. She says this kind of \"I'm so poor!\" stuff a lot and I usually let it slide, but this time I lost it. I told her to stop saying that she's poor. I also said that until the food bank employees know you by name, you can't say shit about being poor. A couple of other things that I can't quite remember, but I didn't sugarcoat it.\n\n\r  \nShe's now upset with me and wants me to apologise for being an asshole about it. I get that she's not rich by any means, but I feel like her acting she's on the same level of poverty as I am is also a dick move. I'm definitely a bit jealous of her lifestyle being better than mine due to circumstances, but I don't begrudge her any of that. I just wish she wouldn't compare overspending on hobbies to not being able to afford medical bills because you decided to eat that week. \n\n\r  \nI can't tell if she's being childish and insensitive or if I'm being a huge jerk. She's a lovely person other than being a bit sheltered, so I don't want to lose our friendship over this fight & I plan to apologise for being harsh about it, but I don't think I'm wrong here.", "created_utc": 1698659915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jpv1h/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_saying_shes/", "score": 2726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is better off financially than you and yet she keeps complaining about being poor. She takes many things for granted, like her home, the food - all that she considers are basic and standard, while you have to pay for each of those things - even the most basic stuff. She doesn't get it. \n\nYou had an outburst because of that, and it's fine. You didn't say anything too harsh to begin with. And now you want to apologise to her, because you don't want to let that small fight ruin a good friendship you have with her. That's quite mature of you. \n\nAll in all, she's just (relatively) privileged brat who is taking some things of her life for granted. It can't be helped. You can stay a friend to her, but stop letting her words affect you all that much.", "NAH, there is always someone with more an someone else with less, no matter who it is. I don't think she meant harm and I think you're having a hard time and took some of it out on her.\n\nShe probably has a lot of friends who do what they want and maybe her current life is a hardship compared to theirs, or compared to her former life; so ironically you both might have similar feelings, just not toward each other.   \n\n\n(Or maybe she envies no one, and compares herself with no one better off, and so it wouldn't *occur* to her *not* to remark about her dejection over her own hardships. It might not have occurred to her that it could sound like a superior comparison to your situation, if she was talking about her own situation.)\n\nHer situation is a bit better (materially, than yours), but hers is *worse* than many at the same time. If she doesn't quite get your situation, well, it sounds like you aren't that empathetic about hers either. (\"She has no right to complain,\" you told her, basically.) Also not everything is material.\n\nPerhaps when things cool down, apologize, and simply ask her not to compare your two situations. Then try to move on, if you think you will enjoy each other's company again.", "NAH, you are poor the moment you drop below 60 % of the average income by definition.", "Soft YTA. The only reason why imo is that although you may be right, she is experiencing struggles in her own way. She isn\u2019t as poor as you, sure, but is it really a suffering Olympics? I was friends with someone with social anxiety so bad they couldn\u2019t even move sometimes. Just because I could move, does that mean I don\u2019t get to say I have social anxiety? Etc.\n\nShe\u2019s disabled enough to need the support, and yeah an escape room isn\u2019t exactly extremely important, but why do disabled people have to live awfully with 0 fun (this isn\u2019t to you, this is to anyone who is going to complain about disability money going to fun things)\n\nI understand you\u2019re frustrated, and probably a bit envious (who wouldn\u2019t be?!) but honesty, if you didn\u2019t have to pay bills you\u2019d likely be a lot like her.\n\nNow I will say one thing, if she were ever like \u201cseriously? I make it work, why can\u2019t you? It\u2019s just $100\u201d or asking you for money, then she\u2019d be TA.", "YTA - you're both poor and you're gatekeeping it from her because she's not as poor as you.\n\nyes, you're on two different levels of poverty and she has more rescouces than you but that does not invalidate that she still struggeles as a poor person would.\n\nalso, in this case, she was emphasizing with, relating with your circumstances, and normalizing your predicament. Assuming she's a normal person, she was doing that to alleviate any shame you may have associated with being poor and to extend comfort by letting you know she can relate. You responded with outrage and indignity at this type of behavior which many adults do not ever develop.", "NAH - her lived experience is feeling poor, and she shares that verbally with people. Hopefully that is something she will stop doing, as she has now learned that some people have it much worse, and the sympathy she is looking to elicit may replaced with resentment. I hope she truly did not realize that you are juggling food and medicine, and put herself in your shoes to imagine how you felt hearing her complain about juggling toys and non-essentials. \n\nOne big outburst is forgivable. Generally speaking, though, you will encounter other people whose privilege can be infuriating. How will you manage these feelings when they creep up again? How can you nip it in the bud earlier with a friendship you want to maintain?", "ESH but in a more \"one is acting badly out of clear ignorance of the situation, the other is acting badly out of frustration over the ignorance\" way.\n\nComparing yourself to others has very limited usefulness, that said, I DO understand that it can be very frustrating and demoralizing to have someone talk as if they're on the same level as you when they are way more insulated from the kind of issues you're dealing with. You should explain that to her.\n\nI hate the sanctioned abelism you're dealing with, on a separate note. I hope your country fixes it's BS so you can get access to what you need.", "ESH\n\nSome context for my answer- I grew up with separated parents, my dad lived in a caravan paycheck to paycheck and we were some level of poor. My mum and step dad lived in a four bedroom three bathroom house. I grew up incredibly aware of money and class, the limitations of it were always on my mind and it was strange looking back to experience both at the same time. \n\nI think yta for gatekeeping, I considered my dad to be quite poor but there were people living worse than us who are poor and people living better than us who were also poor. This may be the same for you and your friend.\n\nI think your friend is ta for not considering that difference and hurting your feelings.", "YTA.

She has a bunch of family support and extra benefits that you don't. Her comparation of having no money because she spend $100 on Fun stuff while you spend It on things you need to survive is beyond ridicolous. And the fact she didn't see that after everything you said shows that she isn't interested in understand.\nP.S: I'm laughing at the people implying that you have better than her because you are independent. You didn't have a choice. You don't have family support to fall back on. This isn't a good thing...", "ESH. She absolutely shouldn't be talking about how she spent $100 on plushies to someone who's struggling to make ends meet. That obviously won't make you feel better. However, her lack of living expenses and possibly poor financial choices don't change the fact that she's also poor. You shouldn't be gatekeeping.

It's not a competition, you can both be poor. \n\n\nShe was trying to empathize with you and let you know that she wasn't upset that you didn't go to the escape room with her, and you were extremely rude to her.", "YTA - you don't get to decide how people class their financial status. People on benefits are not rich and being poor isn't a competition. Just because she gets some more benefits to you doesn't make her not poor and you just sound jealous.", "Nta if she can afford a hundred bucks on dumb shit, she is not poor. She ha material support from her family while you don't. While you both aren't exactly rolling in the dough, she has a safety net which amounts to a lot", "NTA. She sounds really insensitive and she still doesn\u2019t care about how her comets affect you even after you blew up. It\u2019s hard for people who haven\u2019t gone without food to understand true poverty. True poverty is not spending $100 on plushies and knowing you can overspend and still have a home and food. Your friend has a tremendous amount of privilege that she is in denial about.", "She definitely doesn't recognize her privilege means she gets to spend $100(!) on plushies but that same $100 is for you paying a bill she doesn't have to worry about because she lives with her parents. I'd have a discussion with her; apologize for your outburst, and if she doesn't apologize for not using a little perspective and empathy I think it's time to be done with her.", "YTA \n\nDont gate keep poor. Just becase you are poor doesnt mean someone else isnt... In fact almost everyone on Reddit is.", "ESH. She shouldn't complain about being poor, especially when she knows what situation you are in. But you must remember that she is also disabled and might also feel stifled like you have been... you're both in unfortunate situations.", "ESH\n\nOnly because neither of you have mature enough communication skills to discuss this. \n\nYou are not as comparatively well off as she is but that doesn't mean she's not poor. Instead of telling her what she is allowed to say which also comes off as telling her what she's allowed to feel, tell her how her words make you feel. What you said kind of comes off as gatekeeping being poor. It wasn't your intention, sure but intent rarely matters as much as result.\n\n\"I feel ____ when ____ is said/done.\" Avoid accusations and assumptions. State how the situation makes you feel and give her a chance to respond.\n\nCommunication is the single most important skill in any relationship. Y'all are already part of a pretty marginalized community. Don't forget isolate yourself by relying on poor communication skills.", "YTA- for losing it on her. She wasn\u2019t being thoughtful about your financial situation, but you didn\u2019t let her know it bothered you. It is our responsibility to let others know if something bothers us, expecting people to read your mind is a recipe for misery. Look I have been homeless before and I\u2019m disabled so I get it. What helped me was to focus on myself and have a ton of gratitude for what I did have, which objectively was still a lot more than most people in the world. You are going to have to figure out how to not take this stuff personally, because it is not about you. You also need to be able to be there for your friend, even if you wish you had her problems. You should try to cut that type of thinking out. Redirect your thoughts when they go there. Remind yourself that other people are allowed to have problems too, and they aren\u2019t about you. She may have slightly more than you, but she still has struggles.", "YTA. Poverty is not a competition. If it was, there would be homeless people calling you out, too. It's a matter of perspective and you are invalidating your friend's. She might have been a bit tone-deaf, but she was trying to be supportive of you. I'm sure there is a way to have this conversation with her respectfully, without \"losing it\" on her.", "> I (23f) am disabled and live on pension, and have a friend 25f) \"Lila\" who is also on pension. We have very different disabilities, but the specifics aren't really relevant here.\n\nINFO: If they're that different, how are the specifics not relevant?\n\nEDIT: Since I'm getting downvoted for this, let me explain. OP and her friend are both on disability benefits. OP feels that her friend is not allowed to call herself 'poor', since she is on a higher benefit rate than OP. We know why OP isn't on that rate, but we don't know why her friend is, or how much of her money is being spent on medical expenses. We also don't know if spending $100 on plushies *is* an irresponsible impulse purchase, as a lot of people here are saying, or if the friend is spending that kind of money on things for her room because her condition is so severe that she is confined there most of the time, and as such has fewer opportunities to spend it on other things. This is all relevant information that I, personally, would need to know before forming an opinion.", "ESH. Some people are poor from poor financial decisions. And some people are poor due to situations. In her mind she is poor. In your mind you\u2019re poor. But sounds like you have a place to live. So yea. You both are not as poor as a lot of people.", "dude get a job if you want more money. There are a million WFH jobs where all you do is talk on the phone", "u live on handouts? thats mean, the working class of people could be taxed less if you actually held a job", "YTA. What you say about \u201cuntil youve ______ youre not poor,\u201d everyones experience of poverty is different and none of your business nor is it your right to decide who gets to claim to be poor and who doesnt. If you get annoyed with your friends spending habits and then her saying shes poor, fine. But the rest of what you said is just bullshit.", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s not the suffering Olympics.

It's not wrong for her to complain that she's poor or broke, but she shouldn't be complaining about that \\*to you\\* since there's a non-negligible difference in your financial situation.  You would also be an AH if you were constantly complaining to a friend who was homeless and had no pension at all about how hard your financial situation was, even though you are definitely poor yourself.  The plushies and whether you think she \"counts as poor\" are red herrings.\n\nThere's a theory about circles of grief (or depression, or anxiety) summarized as \"supporting in, complaining out\", as in, if there's a tragedy or rough situation, you should do your complaining, venting, grief etc. to people who are further from it, and focus on support rather than complain to the people who are closer to it. (Example - if your neighbor's house burns down, you don't complain to them about how awful an experience this has been for you, even if it's true. You support your neighbor and then complain to a coworker or something.) I think this also applies when there's a noticeable severity in problems like health or finances or relationships, too, that you should support downward and complain upward.\n\nIn the future, I think it's good to let your friends vent a little but then tell them before you hit your limit.  As an example, I'm very stressed about the cost of housing where I live and desperately trying to move.  Sometimes my friends in other cities complain about their high rent, which is completely valid, but at some point I start feeling irritated because we make the same income but my rent is literally twice theirs for a smaller and worse apartment and I would love to be in their situation. I get that this isn't their fault and we're \\*both\\* struggling in our own ways. So I say something like \"Hey, I appreciate we're both stressed out of our minds about housing, but I'm starting to feel overwhelmed on this topic, I'd like to talk about something lighter\".  If you apologize for your outburst but also let her know that when she complains about being poor that it stresses you out since you have even less, hopefully you can get the friendship back on track and I'm sure she doesn't realize it was inconsiderate and was probably attempting to empathize and just went about it the wrong way.", "ESH.\n\n>I'm definitely a bit jealous of her lifestyle being better than mine due to circumstances, but I don't begrudge her any of that.\n\nYou are begrudging her exactly that.\n\nI really don't get a lot of the coments here, judging your friend for how she spends her money.

But when my family started keep me out of the loop for a multitude of reasons (that all boiled down to they didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings) that I realized what bothered me was not being allowed the chance to be able to have my own voice on my wishes and having the decisions made for me. It is something that never bothered me before, but now was different.

It's great that you are trying to be optimistic and grateful despite your circumstances and therefore refuse to be labeled as \"poor\".

That said, you can still allow your griend to feel poor if that's how she chooses to see herself.

But shit no one said you had to lol.", "Alright, another disabled person throwing my hat into the ring but is there a chance these plushies were squishmallows because I\u2019d rank those as assistance devices rather than decorations. They\u2019re not cheap but everyone in my disability circles loves them as they\u2019re one of the only pillows you can fully customize to your body and are useful for injury elevation and reliving pressure. I use them in my bed, for my wheelchair, on my walker\u2014 anywhere my arthritis ridden hips go there\u2019s a squishmallow under them lest my body shatter into a million pieces. They\u2019re genuinely really useful for injury prevention and keeping bed sores at bay so they legitimately really useful tools in addition to being cute.\n\nBut let\u2019s say for a moment they aren\u2019t, even if they\u2019re purely decorative\u2014 being disabled is isolating and restrictive in which the only control you have over the world is in your immediate surroundings a.k.a your bedroom. I\u2019ve got a collection of old dolls I keep on my dresser who serve no other purpose other than keeping me sane as I go through the agony of being trapped in this malfunctioning meat suit; I\u2019ve collected them over the years and they\u2019re second hand porcelain dolls but I\u2019ve also probably spent 100 dollars on them. I\u2019m not able enough nor do I have the funds to do an escape room but will I bemoan that no one should get to do them because I can\u2019t, no because that would only restrict others and who am I to deny joy to others in a world that is so often insufferably depressing\u2014 especially when that someone is also living with the curse of being born in a rebellious body. There are disabled people around this earth who don\u2019t have devises or access to the internet to interact with the world at all, does that mean you and me should have our only access cut off as well because someone has it worse? Basically we could keep going with that thought experiment until all disabled people have nothing and it would just make us all the worse off.\n\nI think the real problem here isn\u2019t that your friend has too much support but you clearly don\u2019t have enough of it and that is a understandably awful position to be in, one I can personally relate to. This world is not at all built around protecting our vulnerable in society and is too often maintained through exploiting the suffering of others. The truth is that you should have more assistance but those who have the power to do so in society made it a bureaucratic nightmare to exclude as many people as possible, so while your getting upset you only have 1 apple and your friend has 3 some asshole has several warehouses full of them and doesn\u2019t have to share because they gave a lawmaker 5,000 apples to not have to contribute back to the society they drained the apples from. Being poor in this society already fucking sucks but being disabled and poor is an unending nightmare I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone and I\u2019m sorry you also got assigned a lifetime economy ticket to the crippled club\u2014 it\u2019s shit and I\u2019m not going to fault you for being frustrated with it because it genuinely sucks and you\u2019re allowed to be upset that it\u2019s unfair. \n\nYeah, having parents who would support me financially would be awesome instead of having ones who labeled me a burden for being born disabled\u2014even though I\u2019m like this due to their awful genetics and didn\u2019t ask to be born in the first place. Being born in circumstances where I had ample resources to not only acquire the things I need to survive but want would be amazing, and getting a better wheelchair that would help me get around would be first on that list. In our society being born to a financially stable family is your only hope in our capitalist dystopia and you\u2019re absolutely double fucked in this system if your disabled. That is extremely unfair and the only ones who benefit from this system are those fucking apple hoarders. \n\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that societies actually cared about their disabled people, where you had all your needs accounted for and room for your wants to get met as well regardless of the circumstances you were born in: you\u2019d be able to hold money in your own name without your benefits being threatened, you\u2019d have actual marriage equality where your spouse making an income for one person wouldn\u2019t deny you what you need to survive, you\u2019d be able to get your medicines and assistance devices that allow you to be in semi stable health, and you can get into the fucking library because idiots would actually build an accessible ramp that won\u2019t launch you across the street. In this world would this even be an argument you\u2019re having? Probably not.\n\nSo I see this less as a interpersonal issue and more an issue this it fucking sucks to be disabled in this world and you\u2019re understandably frustrated to be stuck in it. This is why abled bodied people need to be paying attention to the concerns disabled people have surviving in our society, because I always say it just takes one tragedy for you or a loved one to be thrown into this situation as well. The truth is that structural  changes need to be made on a large scale to ensure people can actually live in it regardless of their situation. So to you, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this and your feelings are valid but your friend is not the problem, it\u2019s the capitalist assholes who benefit from your suffering.\n\nTo everyone else, listen to the plight to disabled people and vote for representatives who advocate for disability rights.", "She can still be poor while not being as poor as you. \n\nNTA, but you were a jerk. You would be an asshole if you continue to feel her she isn't poor, or deny her own hardships. Yes, you have hardships, maybe (probably) even more than she has,  but still you soundness deny she has them too", "I have a wealthy friend with millions in the bank who will cry to me about an unexpected $400 expense. This is not that.", "ESH\n\nComing from the angle of your friend. It really sucks to have a really close friend you used to be able to confide i everything but now you can't because they objectively have it worse. You know with us ladies that ranting is more aboit getting the emotions out. So it sucks to not be able to have someone to share feelings with because they have it worse.\n\nAt the same time, I feel relationships always feel very one-sided if only one person feels comfortable enough to complain. You start to feel more like a therapist then a friend. Especially if it feels like the complaints are because of their doing. Example, they're broke because they made poor decisions. And most of the time they don't wanna hear the truth they just wanna rant. \n\nSo I do think you have a reason to be mad but maybe having just communicated nicely rather then exploding would have been better.\n\nAdditionally (more responding to other commenters), there are plenty of people who are poor because they make poor financial decisions or are unable to save or have this idea of \"If I can never save enough for x in my lifetime, why not just spend the money on things to make me happy\". I don't think that disqualifies someone from being poor.  It's not a contest. Poor is relative from where you are at in life and where you want to be. There is a reason why \"house-poor\" is a term. People wanting the friend to be starving and homeless before being called poor are really looking at \"in poverty\" which I think are different terms. Having said that, \"broke\" might be a more accurate term for your friend in the scenario above.", "NAH. You are valid for getting mad at her for equating your situations. She's also accurate to describe herself as poor. I think the real problem is that she doesn't understand that despite being poor, she's still better off than you.", "YTA, poverty is not a competition.

I don't intend to \"make it a competition\" or \"make it about me\" but some people feel that way regardless of intent. \n\nLike I said I don't think either are actual AHs. I just think when you're under extreme pressure anything can force you to snap if you don't voice your views before it got that way, but again we're all human and have all snapped when it could've been avoided. I know I have, particularly when it comes to finances because there's so much shame that comes along with that social class even if being in that social class is completely out of your control/choices. \n\nJust wanted to add many people who have any MH disorders, even some who don't, who use their personal life experiences to try and relate and be understanding so there's not as much shame talking about that particular topic. \n\nI hope OP and friend don't let this affect their friendship.

It basically gives out food for very cheap (1\u20ac per each adult person in a household but in return you get stuff, that would cost you 70-100+ Euros in the supermarket), so I work with a lot of poor people and let me tell you, you\u2018d never hear someone spending 100\u20ac on things like plushies. These people don\u2019t have 100\u20ac just laying around, which they can afford to spend on anything but absolute necessities. In Germany you also have your social nets, like unemployment money and so on but that money is not nearly sufficient to do stuff like this (the state also pays your rent and other things, when you get unemployment money). Still these people could never afford spending 100\u20ac on anything and going to an escape room in the same month. When they want to buy a smartphone, they have to pay in rates and stuff like that. Many even struggle to come up with that singular Euro to buy food at the Tafel. Poverty is not about how much money you get, it\u2018s about how much money you get to keep at the end of the month, if anything at all. \n\nLila doesn\u2019t have to pay any of her living expenses. She doesn\u2019t have to pay for food, housing, clothing, medical and miscellaneous bills or anything really. That means, that she gets to keep every single cent of her pension, which means, that she probably gets to keep more money at the end of the month, than most working class people. My dad for example gets paid 3400\u20ac a month, 2400\u20ac after taxes and all that jazz. At the end of the month, he gets to keep exactly nothing, assuming I don\u2019t help with bills, groceries and/or rent from my own job. We\u2018re living very simple but not in poverty either because we can pay for ourselves and don\u2019t need outside help to do so. Lila lives with her parents, who have their own money (either as pay for a job or through retirement, it doesn\u2019t matter) and they pay every living expense for her + she gets to keep several hundred dollars from her own pension. That\u2018s a far cry from the people at the Tafel, who simply couldn\u2019t survive without help from the state and us. She lives a very comfortable life financially speaking, she obviously doesn\u2019t face question like whether to pay for the medical bills and not being able to eat for a couple of days or buying food and potentially getting in trouble for not paying bills. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2018s simply not poverty. You have to look at the household budget, not the budget of a single person. That\u2018s how the Tafel works too by the way. People buy food for their household, not for themselves. Even if something were to happen to her pension (if it was lost in the mail or some dumb reason), she\u2018d still have her parent\u2018s money to fall back on. Nothing here screams like poverty to me. Poverty is more than having a smartphone or a car or not, especially when seeing, that you don\u2019t have to pay everything at once and rate payment exists. She wouldn\u2019t even be eligible to buy stuff at the Tafel, assuming her parents or one of her parents are working", "She does have disposable income, though, in the form of government assistance.\n\nThe difference between her and the OP is that one has a much, much higher (though still objectively low) disposable income than the other.", "I think that she is poor for her standards but not struggling in any way financially.", "A lot of people in this post seem to think if you ever get yourself something nice you aren't poor.
