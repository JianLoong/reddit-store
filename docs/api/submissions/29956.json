She is better off financially than you and yet she keeps complaining about being poor. She takes many things for granted, like her home, the food - all that she considers are basic and standard, while you have to pay for each of those things - even the most basic stuff. She doesn't get it. \n\nYou had an outburst because of that, and it's fine. You didn't say anything too harsh to begin with. And now you want to apologise to her, because you don't want to let that small fight ruin a good friendship you have with her. That's quite mature of you. \n\nAll in all, she's just (relatively) privileged brat who is taking some things of her life for granted. It can't be helped. You can stay a friend to her, but stop letting her words affect you all that much.", "NAH, there is always someone with more an someone else with less, no matter who it is. I don't think she meant harm and I think you're having a hard time and took some of it out on her.\n\nShe probably has a lot of friends who do what they want and maybe her current life is a hardship compared to theirs, or compared to her former life; so ironically you both might have similar feelings, just not toward each other.   \n\n\n(Or maybe she envies no one, and compares herself with no one better off, and so it wouldn't *occur* to her *not* to remark about her dejection over her own hardships. It might not have occurred to her that it could sound like a superior comparison to your situation, if she was talking about her own situation.)\n\nHer situation is a bit better (materially, than yours), but hers is *worse* than many at the same time. If she doesn't quite get your situation, well, it sounds like you aren't that empathetic about hers either. (\"She has no right to complain,\" you told her, basically.) Also not everything is material.\n\nPerhaps when things cool down, apologize, and simply ask her not to compare your two situations. Then try to move on, if you think you will enjoy each other's company again.", "NAH, you are poor the moment you drop below 60 % of the average income by definition.", "Soft YTA. The only reason why imo is that although you may be right, she is experiencing struggles in her own way. She isn\u2019t as poor as you, sure, but is it really a suffering Olympics? I was friends with someone with social anxiety so bad they couldn\u2019t even move sometimes. Just because I could move, does that mean I don\u2019t get to say I have social anxiety? Etc.\n\nShe\u2019s disabled enough to need the support, and yeah an escape room isn\u2019t exactly extremely important, but why do disabled people have to live awfully with 0 fun (this isn\u2019t to you, this is to anyone who is going to complain about disability money going to fun things)\n\nI understand you\u2019re frustrated, and probably a bit envious (who wouldn\u2019t be?!) but honesty, if you didn\u2019t have to pay bills you\u2019d likely be a lot like her.\n\nNow I will say one thing, if she were ever like \u201cseriously? I make it work, why can\u2019t you? It\u2019s just $100\u201d or asking you for money, then she\u2019d be TA.", "YTA - you're both poor and you're gatekeeping it from her because she's not as poor as you.\n\nyes, you're on two different levels of poverty and she has more rescouces than you but that does not invalidate that she still struggeles as a poor person would.\n\nalso, in this case, she was emphasizing with, relating with your circumstances, and normalizing your predicament. Assuming she's a normal person, she was doing that to alleviate any shame you may have associated with being poor and to extend comfort by letting you know she can relate. You responded with outrage and indignity at this type of behavior which many adults do not ever develop.", "NAH - her lived experience is feeling poor, and she shares that verbally with people. Hopefully that is something she will stop doing, as she has now learned that some people have it much worse, and the sympathy she is looking to elicit may replaced with resentment. I hope she truly did not realize that you are juggling food and medicine, and put herself in your shoes to imagine how you felt hearing her complain about juggling toys and non-essentials. \n\nOne big outburst is forgivable. Generally speaking, though, you will encounter other people whose privilege can be infuriating. How will you manage these feelings when they creep up again? How can you nip it in the bud earlier with a friendship you want to maintain?", "ESH but in a more \"one is acting badly out of clear ignorance of the situation, the other is acting badly out of frustration over the ignorance\" way.\n\nComparing yourself to others has very limited usefulness, that said, I DO understand that it can be very frustrating and demoralizing to have someone talk as if they're on the same level as you when they are way more insulated from the kind of issues you're dealing with. You should explain that to her.\n\nI hate the sanctioned abelism you're dealing with, on a separate note. I hope your country fixes it's BS so you can get access to what you need.", "ESH\n\nSome context for my answer- I grew up with separated parents, my dad lived in a caravan paycheck to paycheck and we were some level of poor. My mum and step dad lived in a four bedroom three bathroom house. I grew up incredibly aware of money and class, the limitations of it were always on my mind and it was strange looking back to experience both at the same time. \n\nI think yta for gatekeeping, I considered my dad to be quite poor but there were people living worse than us who are poor and people living better than us who were also poor. This may be the same for you and your friend.\n\nI think your friend is ta for not considering that difference and hurting your feelings.", "YTA.

You are absolutely being childish and in the wrong here.", "NTA- Some people really need a reality shock and self awareness. She has a bunch of privilegia that you don't. She has a bunch of family support and extra benefits that you don't. Her comparation of having no money because she spend $100 on Fun stuff while you spend It on things you need to survive is beyond ridicolous. And the fact she didn't see that after everything you said shows that she isn't interested in understand.\nP.S: I'm laughing at the people implying that you have better than her because you are independent. You didn't have a choice. You don't have family support to fall back on. This isn't a good thing...", "ESH. She absolutely shouldn't be talking about how she spent $100 on plushies to someone who's struggling to make ends meet. That obviously won't make you feel better. However, her lack of living expenses and possibly poor financial choices don't change the fact that she's also poor. You shouldn't be gatekeeping. Intsead, tell her that it doesn't make you feel any better when she talks about how she spent a ton of money on non-necessities.", "I don\u2019t understand all these YTA.

It's not a competition, you can both be poor. \n\n\nShe was trying to empathize with you and let you know that she wasn't upset that you didn't go to the escape room with her, and you were extremely rude to her.", "YTA - you don't get to decide how people class their financial status. People on benefits are not rich and being poor isn't a competition. Just because she gets some more benefits to you doesn't make her not poor and you just sound jealous.", "Nta if she can afford a hundred bucks on dumb shit, she is not poor. She ha material support from her family while you don't. While you both aren't exactly rolling in the dough, she has a safety net which amounts to a lot", "NTA. She sounds really insensitive and she still doesn\u2019t care about how her comets affect you even after you blew up. It\u2019s hard for people who haven\u2019t gone without food to understand true poverty. True poverty is not spending $100 on plushies and knowing you can overspend and still have a home and food. Your friend has a tremendous amount of privilege that she is in denial about.", "She definitely doesn't recognize her privilege means she gets to spend $100(!) on plushies but that same $100 is for you paying a bill she doesn't have to worry about because she lives with her parents. I'd have a discussion with her; apologize for your outburst, and if she doesn't apologize for not using a little perspective and empathy I think it's time to be done with her.", "YTA \n\nDont gate keep poor. Just becase you are poor doesnt mean someone else isnt... In fact almost everyone on Reddit is.", "ESH. She shouldn't complain about being poor, especially when she knows what situation you are in. But you must remember that she is also disabled and might also feel stifled like you have been... you're both in unfortunate situations.", "ESH\n\nOnly because neither of you have mature enough communication skills to discuss this. \n\nYou are not as comparatively well off as she is but that doesn't mean she's not poor. Instead of telling her what she is allowed to say which also comes off as telling her what she's allowed to feel, tell her how her words make you feel. What you said kind of comes off as gatekeeping being poor. It wasn't your intention, sure but intent rarely matters as much as result.\n\n\"I feel ____ when ____ is said/done.\" Avoid accusations and assumptions. State how the situation makes you feel and give her a chance to respond.\n\nCommunication is the single most important skill in any relationship. Y'all are already part of a pretty marginalized community. Don't forget isolate yourself by relying on poor communication skills.", "YTA- for losing it on her. She wasn\u2019t being thoughtful about your financial situation, but you didn\u2019t let her know it bothered you. It is our responsibility to let others know if something bothers us, expecting people to read your mind is a recipe for misery. Look I have been homeless before and I\u2019m disabled so I get it. What helped me was to focus on myself and have a ton of gratitude for what I did have, which objectively was still a lot more than most people in the world. You are going to have to figure out how to not take this stuff personally, because it is not about you. You also need to be able to be there for your friend, even if you wish you had her problems. You should try to cut that type of thinking out. Redirect your thoughts when they go there. Remind yourself that other people are allowed to have problems too, and they aren\u2019t about you. She may have slightly more than you, but she still has struggles.", "YTA. Poverty is not a competition. If it was, there would be homeless people calling you out, too. It's a matter of perspective and you are invalidating your friend's. She might have been a bit tone-deaf, but she was trying to be supportive of you. I'm sure there is a way to have this conversation with her respectfully, without \"losing it\" on her.", "> I (23f) am disabled and live on pension, and have a friend 25f) \"Lila\" who is also on pension.

Some people are poor from poor financial decisions. And some people are poor due to situations. In her mind she is poor. In your mind you\u2019re poor. But sounds like you have a place to live. So yea. You both are not as poor as a lot of people.", "dude get a job if you want more money. There are a million WFH jobs where all you do is talk on the phone", "u live on handouts? thats mean, the working class of people could be taxed less if you actually held a job", "YTA. What you say about \u201cuntil youve ______ youre not poor,\u201d everyones experience of poverty is different and none of your business nor is it your right to decide who gets to claim to be poor and who doesnt. If you get annoyed with your friends spending habits and then her saying shes poor, fine. But the rest of what you said is just bullshit.", "YTA\u2014it\u2019s not the suffering Olympics. Suffering is not comparative and both of you have different benefits and things you have to give up because of housing/resources/etc. Why get mad at a friend who understands a similar struggle instead of the system that keeps people in poverty?
