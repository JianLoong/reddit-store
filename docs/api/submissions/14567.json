Find me one reputable source where it's illegal for kids of opposite genders to share a room. You'll deflect because you can't.", "[https://herlawyer.com/cps-children-own-rooms/](https://herlawyer.com/cps-children-own-rooms/)\nHere you go since I doubt you\u2019ll look it up", "NTA. Your 15-year-old niece deserves privacy!", "Why did you invite them to stay and then make such a dick move? YTA", "YTA. The kids could share the larger bedroom or everyone could. Feeling bad for your niece doesn\u2019t justify being hurtful to your nephew.", "YTA. Give the three people the bigger room... Thought that would be common sense.", "NTA your decision", "YTA.  When they get out of your house I suspect they won't be bringing your niece around anymore.  When she's an adult sure she'll come back but wow talk about shooting yourself in the foot.", "YTA I think this is more about favouring your niece OP is just petty and wants to wind up his brother don\u2019t expect Reddit to take your side in a rivalry we know nothing about and are not involved in", "It's a stupid move. The niece will be happy for about 5 minutes, then they will start invading her room, using her bathroom etc. It would have been better to have given her the smaller room, they would have left her alone.", "YTA. From your comments you\u2019re also very immature and blinkered.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m referring to you saying you don\u2019t care about SIL and call your nephew \u201cher son\u201d like he\u2019s nothing to do with you.", "YTA. It was petty. It won\u2019t help the family situation with your niece, it will most likely cause more damage. \n\nPutting 3 people into a smaller room to show your niece love really shits on the other 3 people. Your nephew will remember this as well. You\u2019re basically putting the family at odds with each other and claiming some sort of virtue because you\u2019re treating one of them nice. Long term repercussions will probably be pretty bad for the family.", "YTA. Give the big room the the entire 3 grown people come on\u2026 she still gets her own room and you\u2019re not as much of a fool.", "That's a really weird rooming arrangement, and you're putting a married couple in with a nearly-adult teenage son while giving the teenage daughter her own (much larger) room.  No one but the niece wins there, and the rest of her family will resent her over it.\n\nWhy would you not put the parents in one room and the kids in the other?  Yes, half-siblings of mixed genders sharing a room sucks, but it's not an uncommon arrangement and given their circumstances, it's the best they can hope for.\n\nYTA because you're doing this *intentionally to fuck with them.*", "They are correct.

I will search the other post...", "I\u2019m pretty sure I saw the other side of this from your brothers pov in another post a few days ago and everyone was calling your brother TA", "YTA", "I think that this is a ESH situation. Hear me out Reddit:\n-OP gave the smaller room to 3 ppl and the bigger one to 1 person. Ok its OP's house so she makes decisions. The fact thet you crammed 3 ppl in a small room is A-hole behaviour. \n-The brother is an A-hole for complaining. He wants help and OP helped him. He is like a choosing beggar and thats a A-hole behaviour.\n-The kids (all) are just kids and they are in the middle of this so they are not A-holes.", "NTA, your place your rules.", "Yta. Putting 3 people in one small room doesn\u2019t make sense. Why are you punishing your nephew too in the process?", "Yta putting 3 people in the small room is ridiculous if anything the 2 kids should be in the bigger room then the parents in the smaller", "NTA because I think you have good intentions towards your niece but this family dynamic is already completely screwed up and you will likely make it worse for when they do find a place of their own, I feel like niece will probably be made to suffer for your kindness as it were.\n\nAlthough if things aren\u2019t great for her and you could do it why don\u2019t you offer to have her live with you from now on, especially if her step mother hates her for being the product of her husbands infidelity?", "You mean the mother who hates the niece? She\u2019s an affair child, mom not in the picture, SIL doesn\u2019t want her.", "Yes. What a weird way to split, anyway!", "And he\u2019s 17! Which teenager wants to share a room with his parents. Damn op.", "whats that based on not necessarily disagreeing but don't quite understand how you got to \"OP is sexually attracted to the neice\"", "This comment just screams reddit moment.", "So? Being allowed to do something doesnt magically make you not an arsehole.", "And you\u2019re a damn adult who knows how to say no. Children should not always get what they want. You sound creepy as hell. This is not a defence in the slightest.\nYTA", ">Sorry what? Just because she is the affair child doesn't make her any less my niece\n\nSo what is your excuse for not treating your nephew the same? It's not his fault he isn't an affair child.

It doesn\u2019t even say if OP is male/female/married etc. Nothing to go on to make it creepy.", "Where did you get that \"they treat her like crap \" ? The only info on their relationship is that she and sil don't get along (what a shocker that is,  having to raise her husband's affair child must be such a neat experience after all...) . We also see OP saying that the child she is favoring to the point that she stuck 3 people in the same room to give her the bigger one on her own should be favored every now and then . She then goes on to call her nephew \"her (SIL's) child\"  in the same sentence she calls the younger one \"my niece\" . Safe to say she is biased...", "We wouldn't be on Aita if people weren't making crazy assumptions based on the flimsiest of evidence.", "really reads like deadpan humour to me but what do I know", "Your niece getting the small room to herself while the others share is already favouriting her plenty, this is just taking the piss.", "Genuine question . Isn't her child your nephew ?", "Her child is your nephew. You do realise that right? YTA, you're favouring one child over the other.", "With any new OP's comments im shocked with her more and more."]}
