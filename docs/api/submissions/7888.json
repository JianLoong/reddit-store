I've worn hearing aids or most of my life, so for everyday interactions I just talk to people in English.

I agreed and met her at the bowling place and she and a few other friends were there waiting for me. We bowled for a little bit, ordered food, chatted, etc. \n\nAfter a while, our other friends went off to the connected arcade and HF asked me to stay behind so we could talk. She excitedly told me that she had been learning ASL and wanted to practice with me. I said sure, why not? I started signing, slow phrases because she said she was a beginner. But then she said something that kind of took me aback.\n\nHF: \"But take off your hearing aids though.\" \n\nIt was kind of a weird request, so I asked why. I can sign just fine with them in. \n\nHF: \"Yeah, but y'know, for the full experience!\"\n\nI tried to explain to her that I would really rather keep them in, but she kept on insisting. Eventually she just reached over (I think she was trying to be cutesy about it?) and yanked one out of my ear. \n\nHonestly she didn't even pull that hard but I guess she grabbed it at a weird angle and it ended up breaking in her hand. Like the wire bit was pulled out and torn. She immediately changed her attitude and started apologizing, but I was PISSED. (Hearing aids are NOT cheap!) I ended up yelling at her, then I stood up and walked out of the place. I ended up just driving home. \n\nOur other friends started texting me a little later, telling me that I had left HF crying by herself. I told them the story, but they took her side and said that I was being weird and I should have just took out my damn hearing aids. Why was I being weird about it? It was an accident and I should have just accepted her apology. \n\nIt's been a week and those friends are still nagging me about how I ruined the whole outing. \n\nI'm not sorry that I left, but should I just make up with her?

People need to stop messing with other people's stuff, especially when it's disability related. It's not cute to take someone's hearing aids, or glasses or crutches, or moving their wheelchair without permission. Those items are not just items, they act as a part of your body, something that exists to help you navigate a world that isn't built to accommodate your disability.\n\nI'm thankful I \"only\" have really poor eyesight nowadays, but if someone decided to take my glasses of my face it is classified as assault where I live. If those glasses broke and some tape couldn't keep them decently intact, I would be unable to work, to do most of my hobbies, and generally enjoy independence until I had gotten new ones, which is pretty expensive when even the thinnest glasses are thicker than the thickest frames. One of the main reason I have two pairs now is my fear that something would happen to them and I would have to try live with only seeing clearly at 10 cm.\n\nYour so called friend committed a crime against you, don't let anyone convince you that she is the victim in this situation.", "NTA, so very NTA\n\nI'm HOH. Decent hearing aids for severe to profound hearing loss are stupidly expensive. I mean, they can run $4k each. Each!\n\nMy mother was legally blind without her glasses. Eyeglasses are far less expensive and much more readily replaced. If someone had snatched her glasses off of her face and rendered them useless? Well, let's just say that person should hope they had a good head start!

Run!)\n\nDo you think it's repairable?

She also needs to offer to pay for the repair of your hearing aid.

There are consequences.", "NTA!!\n\nand what the hell was HF thinking? The full experience??!! Did she do something to deafen herself before signing? How dare she!! Hearing-ablist garbage!", "NTA - It was a weird request to begin with and she had no right to touch you or your hearing aids. She obviously has problems with boundaries.

No one should be grabbing your hearing aids from your ear like that.", "NTA. The \"full experience\" excuse is bullshit. YOU ARE NOT A PROP! Say it again (with ASL!) - you are not a prop for her to learn ASL. Forcing you to remove your hearing aids is similar to making someone with really bad eyesight remove their glasses and then perform tricks.", "NTA. I would be charging her for the replacement.

The so called friend was a huge AH you never ever touch another person's belongings let alone any equipment they are using without explicit permission it wasn't cutesy it was downright rude and disrespectful, she has no business in saying what a full deaf ASL experience entails for one that's just shows how ignorant they are deafness doss not equal total lack of sound it varies from person to person.\n\n Each person has their own wording for what deafness means in their hearing loss journey I choose Hearing Impaired when I wear my hearing aids because while they help me function and hear sound I wouldn't hear otherwise I still have issues in certain environments.  When I'm not wearing hearing aids  I.e shower, bedtime of if they are being repaired like right now I class myself as DEAF because I cannot hear speech unless you shout near me and only hear very loud sounds. I have to solely lip-read or use a live transcribe  program.\n\nI wear hearing aids myself so I  know how much they cost and also the repairs as well can get very expensive if not covered by a warrenty or even insurance. Firstly  I'd recommend seeking payment for at least the cost of repair if possible, or for a new hearing aid on a payment plan  if it's not repairable there's truly accidental i.e fell over and hit your hearing aids mid fall with hand, arm, elbow that is an accident what you friend did was entirely avoidable she chose to breach your trust and break what is classed a medical device. If she did that in a hospital they'd charge for the damage, if it was a shop they'd make her buy the broken item or cover the cost to replace, if it was a car she'd have to pay for the repairs or file insurance and still pay out of pocket. See where I'm going it doesn't matter if she is 16 or 100 she needs to be held accountable for her actions in this situation\n\nAgain you are not the ahole you do NOT need to apologize to HF for her actions boohoo she gor upset and cried because you told her the truth about her behavior as for you friends they need to also learn that just because someone is upset by the consequences of their actions does not make you a pushover or weird for not wanting to be the guinea pig or show pony it's is your right to keep your hearing aids in as they are your property to decide if and when you want to remove them for whatever reason not just because someone wants the full sign language with a deaf person experience. \n\nYou are now without a needed hearing aid it doesn't matter that you can sign and manage it's a inconvenience none the less and its wonderful you have a second form of communication not everyone knows sign language and not every deaf person knows it either it is dependant on their hearing loss levals and surrounding environment. So if you didn't know ASL and she broke the only hearing aid you have what would you be expected to do then? Is she going to stand beside you 24/7 and be your interpreter/mediator parhaps this will also be a teachable moment for you and her if you choose to remain friends there needs to be a sit down on what is acceptable behavior towards to the deaf community and hearing aids in general and If she truly wants to learn to better her sign language recommend going to meetups some areas do have groups where people can learn and further their knowledge for free! \n\n\nI wish you luck", "Red flag these are not friends, you are nta", "NTA.

If your family qualifies you can recieve free hearing aids, free earmolds, and free hearing tests. These all affect your education/ learning, especially as a mainstreamed deaf student. Do you know about vocational rehabilitation? They have a Deaf/HoH program that can help you with college and as long as you're working or a student they'll help you in other ways as well. \n\nAs far as school goes you have to be your own advocate and don't let the school tell you \"it's too expensive\" do you at least have an FM system(or I think they've changed to Rodger pens? FM systems were the norm in the 90s)\n\nLook up IDEA and I think 504s for Deaf education to know the wording to advocate for yourself at school and work. \n\nHave you considered making her/ her family pay for a replacement? \n\nHead over to r/deaf if you want to take a peek", "Understandable. I somehow doubt she would've just yanked a hearing person's earbud off, so she should have known better. Maybe if your friends understand this basic etiquette (after they've cooled off) they can pass it along to new people who may not be familiar next time y'all have a get-together. You might try gently explaining it to her too, so a similar mistake isn't made in future.\n\nNTA.", "Oh wow this is a lot of great info, thank you! Since I wear aids my school likes to pretend I'm a hearing person whenever I question about it :// I gotta write all this down lol. \n\nI actually haven't even seen HF since it happened since we're not really on talking terms atm. I did tell my parents about it, and they're on the fence about what to do.", "Schools will often do everything they can to avoid having to pay anything even though you're legally entitled to those accommodations. You're definitely not hearing if you use hearing aids! Lol", "Also, vocational rehabilitation will be a .gov site (your state's.gov) and under one of the DHS links (department of human services). It might be under a disabilities link or on its own.", "NTA.  She crossed a line.  She should apologise to you and pay for repair or replacement.", "Nta damnis she going to push someone out of a wheelchair next.", "The Full Experience?!? What the actual EFF!!! What a complete disregard for you, your property and your respect. Having a Deaf friend is not like having a living ken doll. As a hearing person, this ENRAGES me. File a lawsuit. Get your hearing aid replaced by the person who assaulted you. Check to see if the bowling alley has cameras.", "NTA. Get better friends.", "NTA obviously. She broke your property, wich is also a medical necessary for you. I don't understand the whole full experience thing. I don't know asl but isn't the purpose of this language to do it without needing to speak? So it shouldn't matter if you have your hearing aids in or not.", "NTA. Tell her parents they need to reimburse you for the hearing aid or your parents will take them to court.  Asking you to remove your hearing aides is totally inappropriate and the people telling you your reaction was wrong are total AHs.", "Please tell these so-called friends of yours exactly how much it\u2019s going to cost to replace the hearing aid, and then ask them how they\u2019d feel if someone assaulted them and then made themselves into the victim.\n\nNTA, and I\u2019d dump the entire group and sue the aggressor.", "Your friends are TRASH! There is no excuse for someone causing harm and destroying personal property. Let alone such a lame excuse, HF started crying because she behaved poorly and damaged your hearing aid. NTA.", "NTA. AYFKM? She BROKE YOUR HEARING AID and they think YOU ruined the outing? OMG. No. Just no. It wasn't an accident. It was stupidity and ignorance. What the heck is wrong with her? My eyes nearly popped out of my head as I read this. Those people are not your friends. Who is paying for the repair or the replacement? I'm FURIOUS on your behalf. Furious. Your parents should be taking this up with her parents. Maybe even file a police report for assault and destruction of property. This is a fucking outrage.", "So she physically assaulted you and you're supposed to ignore that?\n\nNTA and she should pay for the repair.", "Yes this, OP you need to be telling your 'friends' that what she did was the equivalent of pushing someone out of their wheelchair, would they still be cool with that??", "Thank you. I've been told that it might be covered by benefits? We're still figuring it out.", "None of this is ok! Your parents shouldn't be ok with you having one hearing aid. None of this should have happened! It was so preventable. I'm so sorry. It's a really awful situation and you're handling it much more gracefully than I ever would.", "Honestly I nearly caved and accepted that I was in the wrong, what with my friends getting on my case about it. I'm kind of floored by the support I've gotten on this post. It's been nice reading all the  comments that are angry right alongside me. Ty."]}
