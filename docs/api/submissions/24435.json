I miss my friend and wonder if I could have done something different.  \n\nSarah (31F) and I (26F) met when we were in undergrad. She was funny and we had a lot in common. Even after school ended, we stayed friends. We'd share memes, vent after bad days, stay at each other's houses. I'd say we were best friends. \n\nShe met a guy, fell in love and got engaged. I was ecstatic for her, and happy when she asked me to be in her bridal party. I'm kind of a dork and had never been to a wedding, let alone played an important part in one. \n\nUltimately the bulk of the planning and the wedding itself was to happen during my last year of law school. \n\nThe final year of law school sucks. I had to do my highest level classes while preparing for the bar the toughest-to-pass state. I let it consume my life and was working on bar prep from 6am to 10pm at least six days a week. I wasn't the best friend during that time. I didn't respond to messages as fast as I should have, and I'd turn down some, not all, bridal hangouts because I had to study. \n\nTowards the summer, things fell apart. She was supposed to get married in September and her venue cancelled in June. She started calling late at night and saying really worrying stuff about her mental health. The first few times this happened I freaked out and talked her down the best I could. I suggested postponing the wedding if it was hurting her this much, or at the very least talking to a professional about all the stress. By the end of the call, we'd both be laughing and everything would be \"fine.\" \n\nHowever these calls kept happening more frequently and I started to dread seeing her name on the phone. Spending a couple hours a night playing therapist then getting up early and studying the minutiae of state vs. federal class action certification was miserable and I got tired of it. She wasn't looking for any solution, just to use me as a therapist. I told her I can't keep taking these calls where she threatens herself, and if she made specific, credible threats to her well-being again, I'd just call 911 since I'm genuinely worried and live 100+ miles away. \n\nShe got incredibly upset, started crying and hung up. A week later, Sarah asked if I could come over to talk. I understood that she was hurt, and really wanted to make things better between us. When I got there, all the bridesmaids were there like it was an intervention. Sarah told me that she had rethought me being in her wedding. She said it felt \"disingenuous\" to have someone there that doesn't really care about her enough to support her, plus I was \"soooo busy.\"  She also told me that I was still welcome to attend the wedding as a guest with no plus 1. I told her I appreciated her telling me in person, but I wouldn't want anything \"disingenuous\" on her big day even as a guest, and she can invite someone else. \n\n\nThat was the last time we spoke.

I was much less emotionally unavailable and devoted to doing my job of (hopefully) passing on the first go and taking care of my own mental health so as not to burden those who care about me. \n\nMy dear friend (let\u2019s call her B) got engaged and asked me to be her bridesmaid and I was so thrilled! B was having a bridesmaid birthday bash about an 2 hours out at an exclusive resort and I was so excited to attend, but it was about 2 weeks out from the bar.

However, during the week of, I realized I couldn\u2019t sacrifice 4 hours of driving and manage being present at the event and recover in time to not take a hit (I have an autoimmune disorder and driving long distances can wear me out and trigger flares). I sadly talked to her about it, and she was incredibly graceful and understanding. B reminded me that my priority was to study and she knew I would be there in the future. It\u2019s a total bummer not to be there for every thing, but you\u2019ve worked so hard to be were you are at today and needed to devote yourself to your responsibilities. \n\nI am sad to hear your friend was not there for you the same way. It seems like you really tried to be supportive of your friend who felt entitled to your time and capacity. That is not okay, especially during a taxing time for you. Which!!!

It sounds like there was an unfortunate confluence of pressure on you and you got frustrated with her unwillingness to make changes to improve her mental health. You made some hard choices.

I prepared myself to fail by repeatedly reminding myself that the worst thing about failing would be that I'd be embarrassed, and no one has ever actually died of embarrassment. I was *absolutely stunned* to find that I had passed. (I was infuriated, however, to discover that I was also going to have to take the neighboring state's exam because my score on the multistate section was ***one f---ing point*** lower than their cut-off \u2013 I live in a border city, so nearly everyone here practices in both states. I passed that exam the following \u2013 is it in February? It's been so long that I can't remember \u2013 but I wasn't even one tenth as anxious going into it.)\n\nI totally agree about the third year of law school, though. We chose our own classes, so we were studying subjects we actually *wanted* to, and there was *much* less pressure. Although, to be fair, I didn't find law school to be all that bad.

Not sure about where you are but we also do a huge number of hours interning our final year which was hectic to say the least. So, I completely understand where you were at time wise.\n\nNow to the bridesmaid issue. You're an intelligent woman, you cannot honestly believe that after you threatened to call 911 on her that you would still be a member of the bridal party. You had other options and you know it. You made the threat because you wanted her to stop calling you with her wedding related problems. If you had genuinely been concerned for her welfare you would have called her fiance, parents, friend who lived closer by etc. You wanted her to stop calling and I totally understand that, what she was doing was selfish and inconsiderate of your time. However, threats like that have consequences, this was yours. Are you an A H ... Not really. Should she have dropped you from the bridal party ... Absolutely. Should the bride have ousted you in public ... Absolutely not, she did that to humiliate and shame you and that was wrong so I agree with not attending the wedding - honestly I think the way she ousted you was done deliberately to ensure you wouldn't.\n\nThis is a great example of why you should not volunteer for events you don't actually have time for - now you are down a friend.", "Leaning towards YTA.

I've been through a similar situation with a family member. I couldn't be her everything when it was clear she needed mental health help.

Nobody is studying for the bar during law school.  2. Third year is so pointless that numerous schools have done away with it to make a 2 year program.. it is notoriously the easiest year.", "Yeah, 3L was much less stressful (at least until I got COVID during finals lol, but that's a different story) because I knew my professors, I organized my classes so that I had mostly paper or project based ones, and I was in subjects that I was interested in and familiar with, not trying to figure out how the hell administrative law works.\n\nTo be fair, if I'd started seriously bar-prepping during that time, that would have ratcheted up the stress a lot more, but I got the advice not to begin in earnest until after graduation, which I'm glad I took.\n\nJune and July though, I was probably studying 14 hours a day, 6 days a week, and didn't have the capacity for anything else. I couldn't even go to a wedding as a guest in July, because I didn't have the day to spend on it.\n\nI do wonder if her friend's issues were as severe as OP presented them, or if it's possible that OP was under so much other pressure that it felt much bigger than it was, but tbh just on principle I'm going to say that you're NTA for not being able to be a friend's support person while you're in the midst of bar prep.", "Carly Robinson. \n\nNTA, and it sounds like you saved yourself a lot of drama.", "I feel like OP is leaving out a detail. Why drive? Why was everyone there?

Although, I think my year was a little bit special, because a bunch of us had prepped the DC application and they informed us, after many states had closed their applications, that they would not be able to seat as many law students as usual because their convention center had been booked by an anime convention, so many of us would be turned away just as a numbers thing...

It was for sure a petty move on both sides.", "NAH\nIt is an extremely sad situation. But one needs to have internal recourse to console and to support. And here nor you, nor your friend has any.", "This honestly sounds like a communication issue from both sides. It sounds like you didn't communicate to your friend, \"I would love to be your bridesmaid, but I wanted you to be aware I am in my last year of law school. I am going to be studying from 6 am to 10pm and until I graduate, law school is going to be my priority. I won't have time to attend all the bridesmaids duties. You should know that in advance\".\n\nSame with the calls. There should have been a conversation about the affect the calls were having on you before the conversation where you said you weren't going to take her distressed calls anymore and you would call the police if they kept coming.\n\nWhile having an intervention with all her bridesmaids was really aggressive and unnecessary, she was leaving the door open with your friendship by saying you can attend as a guest. And you admit yourself you had been checked out of bridesmaids duties before the calls started, maybe your friend hadn't fully understood the context -Law School - as being the reason why. So you refusing to attend the wedding was a strong reaction. ESH", "NTA", "NTA She was using you and then got mad when you said you wouldn't do that anymore.

That's a one way relationship.
