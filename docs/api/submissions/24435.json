{"id": 24435, "submission_id": "15onm0m", "title": "AITA for not going to a friend's wedding after getting kicked out of the bridal party?", "selftext": "This happened a couple months ago. I miss my friend and wonder if I could have done something different.  \n\nSarah (31F) and I (26F) met when we were in undergrad. She was funny and we had a lot in common. Even after school ended, we stayed friends. We'd share memes, vent after bad days, stay at each other's houses. I'd say we were best friends. \n\nShe met a guy, fell in love and got engaged. I was ecstatic for her, and happy when she asked me to be in her bridal party. I'm kind of a dork and had never been to a wedding, let alone played an important part in one. \n\nUltimately the bulk of the planning and the wedding itself was to happen during my last year of law school. \n\nThe final year of law school sucks. I had to do my highest level classes while preparing for the bar the toughest-to-pass state. I let it consume my life and was working on bar prep from 6am to 10pm at least six days a week. I wasn't the best friend during that time. I didn't respond to messages as fast as I should have, and I'd turn down some, not all, bridal hangouts because I had to study. \n\nTowards the summer, things fell apart. She was supposed to get married in September and her venue cancelled in June. She started calling late at night and saying really worrying stuff about her mental health. The first few times this happened I freaked out and talked her down the best I could. I suggested postponing the wedding if it was hurting her this much, or at the very least talking to a professional about all the stress. By the end of the call, we'd both be laughing and everything would be \"fine.\" \n\nHowever these calls kept happening more frequently and I started to dread seeing her name on the phone. Spending a couple hours a night playing therapist then getting up early and studying the minutiae of state vs. federal class action certification was miserable and I got tired of it. She wasn't looking for any solution, just to use me as a therapist. I told her I can't keep taking these calls where she threatens herself, and if she made specific, credible threats to her well-being again, I'd just call 911 since I'm genuinely worried and live 100+ miles away. \n\nShe got incredibly upset, started crying and hung up. A week later, Sarah asked if I could come over to talk. I understood that she was hurt, and really wanted to make things better between us. When I got there, all the bridesmaids were there like it was an intervention. Sarah told me that she had rethought me being in her wedding. She said it felt \"disingenuous\" to have someone there that doesn't really care about her enough to support her, plus I was \"soooo busy.\"  She also told me that I was still welcome to attend the wedding as a guest with no plus 1. I told her I appreciated her telling me in person, but I wouldn't want anything \"disingenuous\" on her big day even as a guest, and she can invite someone else. \n\n\nThat was the last time we spoke. I can't help but wonder if I was the AH for refusing to take any more calls, and refusing to attend as a guest.", "created_utc": 1691794718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15onm0m/aita_for_not_going_to_a_friends_wedding_after/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was going through a rough patch, but so were you! You\u2019re right to say that you aren\u2019t her therapist, and if she\u2019s struggling with mental health then she should be seeing a professional.  Venting to a friend is one thing - threatening personal safety is quite different. Additionally, was she talking to her fianc\u00e9 about her mental health during these times? \n\nIt sounds like you really did try your best to be there for her, despite your already huge mental load. But was she there for you? \n\nAlso: it\u2019s bullshit that she brought in the bridesmaids when it was finally time to talk face to face. Proper friends discuss problems head-on without needing backup to gang up on somebody.", "NTA, you aren't her therapist, and she wasn't paying you. Also, did she call every single other bridesmaid as much that late at night? I doubt it.", "So you drove 100+ miles one way in a day to talk to her in person.  And then another 100+ miles back?  That seems like a pretty large time commitment for a overwhelmingly busy person.\n\nNTA but you have to wonder why she was calling you all the time and not the other bridesmaids.  You probably dodged a bullet here and you need to move on.", "NTA.\n\nUnless you're a licensed therapist, you are not equipped to continually manage somebody else's mental health issues.  The occasional support call is fine but sounds as if this was becoming onerous at a time when you had zero time to do this.\n\nSarah didn't understand the demands on your time and wanted you to revolve around her and her wedding.  Wondering if somebody didn't talk her into this \"intervention\" to disinvite you to the bridal party.\n\nI probably wouldn't have gone to the wedding after the \"intervention.\"", "NTA. People like Sarah are exhausting. I've had to end friendships with people like her because they will suck the life out of you with their drama and lack of willingness to do about it.\n\nThe fact is, she was attention seeking and you fed into it. She didn't like it when you cut her off. She had a pile of other bridesmaids to help her. She sounds like a lot of work as a friend and you did what you could given your circumstances to support her.\n\nThat said, remember, just because someone calls does not mean you have to pick up.", "You\u2019re nta for refusing to be a yes man for somebody who was freely trauma dumping on you at the most important time in your studies.

And the entire group of bridesmaids are there too as a surprise? That doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Interestingly enough I was in a similar situation as you this past summer. \n\nStudying for the CA bar was brutal. I was much less emotionally unavailable and devoted to doing my job of (hopefully) passing on the first go and taking care of my own mental health so as not to burden those who care about me. \n\nMy dear friend (let\u2019s call her B) got engaged and asked me to be her bridesmaid and I was so thrilled! B was having a bridesmaid birthday bash about an 2 hours out at an exclusive resort and I was so excited to attend, but it was about 2 weeks out from the bar. When I committed to it, I truly believed I could manage my schedule well enough to feel secure about studying and doing all I could to be there for B. However, during the week of, I realized I couldn\u2019t sacrifice 4 hours of driving and manage being present at the event and recover in time to not take a hit (I have an autoimmune disorder and driving long distances can wear me out and trigger flares). I sadly talked to her about it, and she was incredibly graceful and understanding. B reminded me that my priority was to study and she knew I would be there in the future. It\u2019s a total bummer not to be there for every thing, but you\u2019ve worked so hard to be were you are at today and needed to devote yourself to your responsibilities. \n\nI am sad to hear your friend was not there for you the same way. It seems like you really tried to be supportive of your friend who felt entitled to your time and capacity. That is not okay, especially during a taxing time for you. Which!!! Is only time-limited and lasts literally 2 months to prep for. And the whole \u201cgathering up the other bridesmaids\u201d thing so they witness this is awful and unnecessary. \n\nVerdict: NTA", "I don't think you were the asshole. It sounds like there was an unfortunate confluence of pressure on you and you got frustrated with her unwillingness to make changes to improve her mental health. You made some hard choices. I do think her response was over-the-top and unfortunate, but I wonder if it more reflected her mental health status than anything about you. I suggest you call or send a card and tell her you hope that she's feeling better and wish her the best and would like to mend your friendship. See what happens. NTA", "NTA", "NTA- she was using you like an emotional support human. That's not a fair thing to do.", "NTA though I do question your unavailability. The third year of law school is a breeze.  The first year is hardest.  So you have that totally backwards, though I do understand the pressures of studying for the bar during the summer after.  Thinking you just got annoyed she was using you as a therapist, which is fine and still makes you NTA.", "NTA. You did the right thing. She sounds kinda of flakey.", "You dodged a bullet here.

It seems to be a rare thing to come across a story of a bride who is so supportive and understanding of others during their own stressful time. She deserves a fruit basket or something!", "I remember being so convinced that I was going to fail the bar exam that, if I hadn't already paid to take that first one (and of course, you can't get a refund, or at least you can't, like, a week or two before), I would have just not taken it that first time around, and would have waited until the winter one. I prepared myself to fail by repeatedly reminding myself that the worst thing about failing would be that I'd be embarrassed, and no one has ever actually died of embarrassment. I was *absolutely stunned* to find that I had passed. (I was infuriated, however, to discover that I was also going to have to take the neighboring state's exam because my score on the multistate section was ***one f---ing point*** lower than their cut-off \u2013 I live in a border city, so nearly everyone here practices in both states. I passed that exam the following \u2013 is it in February? It's been so long that I can't remember \u2013 but I wasn't even one tenth as anxious going into it.)\n\nI totally agree about the third year of law school, though. We chose our own classes, so we were studying subjects we actually *wanted* to, and there was *much* less pressure. Although, to be fair, I didn't find law school to be all that bad. I had some really great professors, though, who made most of my classes genuinely interesting, which definitely helped.", "That and literally no one studies for the bar during the last year of law school? You start studying post-finals so beginning of May at the earliest. I\u2019m calling bullshit.", "Assumed bar study and work prospects - yep more stressful than first year", "You know that most of these stories are fake, right counselor?", "Everything you just said about the bar is exacty how I felt.  I was floored when I found out that I passed.  One of the worst feelings I ever felt was walking out of there on the so second day so convinced I had wasted three years of my life.", "The bar exam is a beast. The mental part is the worst. 3 years of law school at stake and you can only test twice a year (fall and winter). Fail and your investment is worthless at least for awhile Until you pass, if ever. Studying night and day is almost universal. I have friends who still talk about the horror of the bar exam 25 years later. NTA."]}
