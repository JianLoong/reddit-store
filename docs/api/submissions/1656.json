Work is work and outside of it we do as we please but I would hate to have someone feel uncomfortable or misunderstand me or him due to unintentionally witnessing us being flirtatious/affectionate. I could understand the peck on the cheek but the whole convo and bum pat takes it to an awkward place if I didn't know either of you. To be honest, if I did know you and was a coworker I probably wouldn't feel totally comfortable about it either. And I'm no prude, just think there's a time and a place.

Pat on the butt was a little weird though lol. For the sake of professionalism you may wanna tone it down.

Ya never know who\u2019s watching unfortunately.", "NTA but remember, you're at work. Don't pat someone's ass at work, even if she is your wife. Even if everyone there knew she was your wife, it is wildly inappropriate to pat someone's ass in your workplace. There is a time and place for that.", "YTA \n\nThere is a time and a place for joking around like that, and at work where there is even the tiniest chance that a customer/client who isn't family or a friend might walk in on you is not it. \n\nAs far as this particular situation, you making it sound like your wife got a discount for kissing you didn't look good at all. If you are indeed allowed to use your employee discount for family members, you should not mention it and instead just tell them what their total is. \n\nPatting your wife's ass after this only made the whole thing look worse. Like you thought you had the right to touch someone inappropriately just because you gave them a discount. \n\nHad it simply been a \"thanks honey\" and a quick kiss on the cheek, no one where I live would have reacted at all. Unless it was during the height of the recent pandemic of course. \n\n\\-----\n\nThe customer overreacted too, but anyone who has worked retail and/or in a coffee shop (or fast food place, or as a server etc.) for years should be used to handling people like that from time to time.

Anyone who thinks a kiss on the cheek and a sweet joke was inappropriate and you deserved to be harassed is not a good person.", "NTA for wanting ti show your wife some love and affection while no one's around, but you're at work and should probably keep it to a minimum in case there was a hidden customer around like there was for this time. Kiss on the cheek and an I love you at most just ward people like that off if they're hidden.", "Holdup rereading this. You rang up your wife with your employee discount acknowledging no one else was around (kinda looks like you knew you were doing something inappropriate that you didn't want anyone to see). You point out you've been there since being a teenager. Nowhere do you comment being allowed to ring up family or in general having lenient bosses.\n\n But circling back, you ring up your wife then make an inappropriate comment (in light of workplace professionalism) and pat your wife's rear while making a comment implying you gave her a discount for a kiss. You then backtrack saying this happens a lot and you fell for her because she didn't do that (so why you'd then have her do it eludes me). A customer who sees the interaction calls you out because one of two things happened to them: one is that you are lying and you gave the female customer a discount for a kiss and sexually harassed her in public or two you are telling the truth and just went over the top in public. Which is more believable to the customer? This then negatively affects the business by the negative review.\n\nHonestly speaking, if I were that couple then you'd either be fired or disciplined for making inappropriate comments on company times and making a customer uncomfortable.

A store that serves the public has a legal status very different from regular private property, like your home.", "So, if someone decided to film a shot in a popular town in your area, even if they just walk into your shot they can just sue you if you don't delete it?\n\nLike how strict is that law exactly?", "Ok, but that sucks, because celebrities are just well-known normal people. So you can harass people if they're famous, but you can't if they're not? And who determines who is a celebrity? It seems like one standard should apply to everyone.", "There are also different laws for just taking pictures vs posting them. If you take a picture at a public place and a person is clearly visible and stand out you\u2018re only allowed to post it if they consent. If they just happen to walk in the background it\u2018s most likely fine and you don\u2018t have to ask but maybe they could still do something against it.\nMinors can\u2018t consent. If it\u2018s blurry it\u2018s a none issue \nIt also depends on the intention behind the picture \n\nSometimes only posting pictures is illegal and sometimes even just taking them is illegal, like if you\u2018re harassing someone, take a picture on purpose vs they just happen to be in it, you\u2018re in public or a private space, if they consent or not etc\n\nSo if someone posted a picture of you on social media and you didn\u2018t like it, the law would be on your side, but then again not everybody is gonna take the effort to sue over pictures, but knowing they could is already enough to prevent it from happening in the first place", "I agree it\u2018s not okay. The law isn\u2018t that specific in that regard because celebrities are kinda considered to be of public interest. So if it\u2018s idk s model at a fashion show or an actor at a red carpet you can post it but if you stalk them in private when they are not working they still have some of those rights. In the end a judge would judge what\u2018s a matter of public interest or an invasion of privacy but my country doesn\u2018t have that many celebrities or paparazzi so it\u2018s not really an issue"]}
