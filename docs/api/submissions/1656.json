If she tries the \"pretty girl\" discount thing again, say you DO give discounts for pretty girls and then ring her up like normal.", "NTA The lady was crazy. The ass pat maybe a bit too far lol but flirting with your wife doesn't make you an AH. And how super creepy she was recording yall.", "NTA. After 30 years together the day my husband stops patting my ass when I walk through a door in front of him is the day it\u2019s over.

But I don't imagine your wife walks around with an \"OPs Wife\" tattoo on her forehead. Professionalism is a thing,  and none of you displayed it.", "ESH you're at your job and I assume expected to maintain a level of professionalism which you did not do weather you knew a customer was there or not. And the customer sucks because she basically tried to blackmail you after refusing her a discount.", "The girl was absolutely crazy, but YTA for inappropriate conduct at work regardless of if you thought you were alone or not, its a public place and you're a professional.  Cmon", "YTA. As much as you might love your wife you were at work and should be acting somewhat professional. Given what you said and did I would have gave a verbal notice of unprofessional conduct (not in your record but don't do it again or would write you up). What if your wife was having a bad day and was crying while you did that. A customer could have forwarded that to your bosses boss (didn't type store but assuming it's like the kiosk in booksamillion) and you could have been fired on the spot for sexual harassment especially if it was a bad facial picture and didn't clearly show it was your wife.\n\n\nBasic rule is if the optics could be taken badly don't do it", "NTA-\n\nGirl was entitled and crazy. Also pissed she didn't get a discount. \n\nRespond to the review so it lessens any impact on the store.", "NTA\n\nNever stop flirting with your wife no matter how old you get.", "As someone who works with their partner, I make a point to NEVER put anyone else in an awkward position due to our behaviour. Work is work and outside of it we do as we please but I would hate to have someone feel uncomfortable or misunderstand me or him due to unintentionally witnessing us being flirtatious/affectionate. I could understand the peck on the cheek but the whole convo and bum pat takes it to an awkward place if I didn't know either of you. To be honest, if I did know you and was a coworker I probably wouldn't feel totally comfortable about it either. And I'm no prude, just think there's a time and a place. So I'm gonna have to go a soft YTA here. However, the woman threatening to call the police seems a bit dramatic but you kinda invited the idea of a discount for flirtatious women with your behaviour, whether intended or not.", "The only thing you shouldn\u2019t have done was patted her butt. It was extremely unprofessional to do it at work. Other than that NTA.", "So\u2026 I noticed you happened to leave out the joke you made. Was it in any way sexual? If so, that\u2019s incredibly inappropriate and it also may come off that you\u2019re trading butt pats and kisses for a discount, which most women would find offensive. Until you clarify this, YTA.", "NTA\n\nSome of you here are not in healthy relationships and it shows.", "Nta \n\nMisspickme is mad\ud83d\ude02", "going to say NTA but your are working so maybe keep it to slight affection and not ass slapping?", "NTA - crazy creeper if she really recorded you. People will see thru the review, and if they choose to not try a business based on it, their loss", "NTA", "NTA\nThat lady is insane", "NTA    the woman was jealous.", "NTA at all. That lady was going to write a bad review no matter how you replied to her. She was just looking for an excuse.", "\u201cThis man! I want him arrested! He did not sexually assault me!!!!!\u201d", "A lot of people try to flirt with me at my job believe it or not. I fell in love with my wife because she wasn\u2019t like that. Best customer.\n\nEdit: the girl was objectively attractive so I wonder if this is just how she acts with employees. Begging for discounts lol", "That made me burst out laughing!", "lmaooo", "I get recorded a lot mostly by teenagers and like women in their 20s. It\u2019s annoying.", "I feel the same way. He's been doing it for 35yrs, something would be wrong if he stopped.", "He might if you ever need hip replacement surgery, in which case I hope you forgive him and stay together because you both sound like a great couple.", "I'm kind of leaning that way too. Plus I'm uncomfortable with him ringing his wife up too. Maybe it's different for small businesses, but most places don't let you ring up family. And yeah customer is batty, but that is very unprofessional of him. With the general attitude of \"I've worked there since I was a teenager\", that certainly doesn't help things either.", "That's why it's important to have full sex with your wife in front of everyone each time she visits the cafe. Just so there's no risk of misinterpretation.", "Well aren't you a lot.", "The 1950s called. They want their mores back. OP is NTA.", "Ffs. He thought they were alone. This prudish nonsense in the US (and I\u2019m assuming the UK or some British-occupied territory with some of your spelling) is a bit much.", "I don't agree with the comments that this outlook is prudish.  PDAs  make people uncomfortable.   It doesn't matter that he thought he was alone, he wasn't.", "How hot ARE you?!?!?", "Why? Do they think you\u2018re good looking?", ">It\u2019s annoying.\n\nIt can be considered a crime report them maybe?", "Fair point and thank you.", "Personally I feel the level of outrage in your unrequired and unrequested response is 'a bit much' but hey ho, we're all entitled to our opinions. All the best.", "Yeah no one wants to see that, they both suck but mildly.", "I too, would like to know.", "Yeah. It sucks that I can\u2019t kick anyone out for recording me", "I\u2019m not outraged at all, just think it\u2019s a bit silly", "Have you mentioned to your  boss? Maybe they can put a notice in the store no filming others without consent or something. I'd find that to be harassment", "That\u2018s bizarre to me, you totally could do that in my country. Filming without your consent is illegal", "Good for you. Thanks for sharing your opinion on my opinion.", "And the us, in most states, you can record just about anything that happens in a \"public place\", and you can record any conversation or whatever as long as one of the parties consents.", "You\u2019re welcome, I guess? Welcome to Reddit/social media, where conversation threads don\u2019t inherently end after one response to the original post.", "Ok wow thanks for that level of insight into the complexities of the internet. I mean, in my 40 odd years of living on this planet, I remember it being invented, but I never used it before so that really helps...", "I also remember it being invented, not sure what relevance that has to my pointing out your strange implied critique of me \u201csharing (my) opinion on (your) opinion\u201d. If you were instead being genuine there and that wasn\u2019t sarcastic, I apologize for my assumption. Have a good one!"]}
