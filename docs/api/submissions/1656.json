If you are indeed allowed to use your employee discount for family members, you should not mention it and instead just tell them what their total is. \n\nPatting your wife's ass after this only made the whole thing look worse. Like you thought you had the right to touch someone inappropriately just because you gave them a discount. \n\nHad it simply been a \"thanks honey\" and a quick kiss on the cheek, no one where I live would have reacted at all.

You rang up your wife with your employee discount acknowledging no one else was around (kinda looks like you knew you were doing something inappropriate that you didn't want anyone to see). You point out you've been there since being a teenager. Nowhere do you comment being allowed to ring up family or in general having lenient bosses.\n\n But circling back, you ring up your wife then make an inappropriate comment (in light of workplace professionalism) and pat your wife's rear while making a comment implying you gave her a discount for a kiss. You then backtrack saying this happens a lot and you fell for her because she didn't do that (so why you'd then have her do it eludes me). A customer who sees the interaction calls you out because one of two things happened to them: one is that you are lying and you gave the female customer a discount for a kiss and sexually harassed her in public or two you are telling the truth and just went over the top in public. Which is more believable to the customer? This then negatively affects the business by the negative review.\n\nHonestly speaking, if I were that couple then you'd either be fired or disciplined for making inappropriate comments on company times and making a customer uncomfortable.
