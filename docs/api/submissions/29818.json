The reason for the divorce is my dad found god and became super religious after being an atheist for years and marrying my mom and having me as an atheist. My parents were on the same page until they weren't and my dad was pushing for mom to convert and to baptize me and stuff. My mom didn't give in and they ended up divorcing. In the divorce mom was granted decision making on religion so while I technically could attend church with them until I turned 12, once I turned 12 it could not be forced. I could not be forced to attend religious education classes and would not be forced into becoming a member of the church.\n\nAs soon as I was 12 I was out of church and I have never stepped back inside since.\n\nMy dad remarried when I was 7 and he and my stepmom have kids together. They were both really distressed when I said no to church and when I refused to attend church stuff with them. Even more so when I didn't pray with them. I sit quietly when they do that but I do not join in. I even told them I have never said a single prayer in my life. They might have brought me to church for years but I did not take part in any of it.\n\nNow that I'm almost 18 they are starting to panic and they have been trying to pull me into these conversations where they aske me to give religion and god a chance, they wanted me to attend church once or twice more with them and really listen, etc, etc. I always knew it was a no. The first time they started saying this stuff it was a no. I don't believe in any of it. I never have and I never will. I told them the last time that I am never going to believe in their religion and I will never give it more of a shot. I said they can believe and that's fine. But I'm an atheist who doesn't believe in god or heaven or anything spiritually.\n\nMy dad and stepmom said I could respect them enough to try and my stepmom was crying about their kids and how awkward and sad it will be for them when they realize their big brother dismisses what they believe. They're really pissed off about it and they said I was disrespectful before I went home to mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698487530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ialhz/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_stepmom_im_never/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They know I have never really cared to hear the religious speak too so they might assume I'll feel differently if I try to listen and give it a chance.

The *judge* said so, *too. \n\nYour half siblings will just have to get over the fact that you-and lots of other people in the world -don\u2019t believe what they do-or at all.", "NTA. Imagine the pearl clutching when the step sibs realise that most of the world's population doesn't share their parents BS religion.\n\nYou could 'respect' their beliefs, but why should you have to?  They don't respect your beliefs.  You only have to respect their right to have their beliefs", "NTA, From what you\u2019ve said, religion just isn\u2019t your thing and you say it\u2019s not going to happen. Stick to your convictions and be your own person if that\u2019s how you feel.", "NTA and religious faith is not something that can be coerced. It sounds like you've been honest but respectful. I think they're just worried that your half siblings will realize that being religious is a choice and also bow out.", "NTA. I would have said N A H if they were concerned about your soul going to hell or something, but they are mad about you disrespecting them and dismissing what they believe. Too bad. You have the right to reject ideas. Don't be an asshole, but yeah. You don't have to believe if you don't want to.", "NTA. Based on what you are saying you have not behaved disrespectfully at all. They are pushing for you, an adult, to accept their religion. You have politely declined. That is not disrespect on your part. They however are (as is the case with many rigidly religious people) disrespectful of any belief system that differs from theirs, including, I've noticed, and variant of their own religion (Protestant vs Catholic, Sunni vs Shi'a etc) .  Live your life as you want and ignore them.", "NTA \n\nAnd credit to you for being steadfast in your desire to not going their church but also not being a jackwagon about it.   \n\nIt's almost like people *can* be kind and polite with out the threat of some invisible entity coming down on them.\n\nI would just continue to roll with the 'I belive that you belive and that's great' You're almost  18 and soon to be fully in charge of your life. That's why they are panicked. Soon they will have zero control over you.\n\nI might be prepared for some collateral damage tho. At 18 they can't control you but can control your half sibs. They might cut contact between you, as a bad influence on them. If you have a good relationship with them, and want to keep it.... I might start now with the 'no matter what I will always love you and be here, if you need me' talk. You never know.... One of then might need a safe place to go if religion isn't for then either.\n\nThere is no hate like Christian love", "NTA keep on being you.

Having a disagreement about beliefs is not disrespect. Unless you're shouting at them and calling them names and being insulting, you are not being disrespectful by not participating in their faith. If anyone is being disrespectful here, it's your dad and stepmom who are refusing to accept a simple \"no thanks\"", "NTA your dad and step mom are disrespecting you. It\u2019s hard for delusional people to see beyond themselves. They view you as an extension of themselves. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so distraught especially hyper religious people. They always view their children as mindless play doh they can mold however they want and they are betrayed and jaded when they find out kids are actual sentient beings", "NTA.", "NTA they and so many others need to learn to quit shoving their fandom down people\u2019s throats.

He is not going to respect his offspring now.\n\nOP needs to put a limit to his dad discussing religion with them, after all religion is what destroyed their family in the past.", "I've been in this spot with my own father.  He'll never stop asking me to go to crutch..I mean church.  I have tried to set this very firm boundary, but he tramples it no matter what.  So many just do not take no for an answer.  It's disgusting.  I hope OP's family is not as relentless as most are.\n\nAny religion that tells you to keep trying to convert everyone and never back down is doomed to create conflicts for themselves."]}
