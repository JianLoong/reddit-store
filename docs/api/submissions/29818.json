I always liked the cool stories in the bible but prayers before mealtimes always felt like a chore and I genuinely couldn\u2019t comprehend how some people actually prayed to god daily. I didn\u2019t feel any kind of connection to god, I didn\u2019t care about him and the only reason I attended church was because my parents forced me and sometimes the church would have fun activities for the kids. When I was 11-12, I told my mom upfront that I didn\u2019t believe in god and never would because I didn\u2019t feel like I was actually talking to anyone when I prayed and she asked if I was upset that I prayed for a new toy and god didn\u2019t give me one. I was pretty frustrated by this because by that age I was less interested in toys and more in books and it felt like my mom was treating me like a kid(not too important but ehhh). I tried to get the point across but she just started monologuing about how she didn\u2019t believe in god as a kid but then she had her own personal miracle and that one day I would find my connection to god. The talk lasted almost 30 minutes and her tone was really preachy and it just upset me. After that we didn\u2019t bring it up much and I didn\u2019t try talking about it to my dad, but every now and then my mom will mention it in a conversation in a way that feels like she\u2019s trying to be subtly disapproving but it\u2019s just in your face and every time this comes up things get very awkward. I just try to keep quiet whenever something about religion pops up. As you can see, my situation was clearly a lot better than op\u2019s but I still felt like my opinions and beliefs were being disregarded and it doesn\u2019t feel good at all.

So, compliment their extreme bravery at choosing any single religion and crazy luck that they happened to be exposed to the one and only correct religion. \n\nAlso, don't let them speak to you as through there's only one perspective.
