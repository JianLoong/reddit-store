I always liked the cool stories in the bible but prayers before mealtimes always felt like a chore and I genuinely couldn\u2019t comprehend how some people actually prayed to god daily. I didn\u2019t feel any kind of connection to god, I didn\u2019t care about him and the only reason I attended church was because my parents forced me and sometimes the church would have fun activities for the kids. When I was 11-12, I told my mom upfront that I didn\u2019t believe in god and never would because I didn\u2019t feel like I was actually talking to anyone when I prayed and she asked if I was upset that I prayed for a new toy and god didn\u2019t give me one. I was pretty frustrated by this because by that age I was less interested in toys and more in books and it felt like my mom was treating me like a kid(not too important but ehhh). I tried to get the point across but she just started monologuing about how she didn\u2019t believe in god as a kid but then she had her own personal miracle and that one day I would find my connection to god. The talk lasted almost 30 minutes and her tone was really preachy and it just upset me. After that we didn\u2019t bring it up much and I didn\u2019t try talking about it to my dad, but every now and then my mom will mention it in a conversation in a way that feels like she\u2019s trying to be subtly disapproving but it\u2019s just in your face and every time this comes up things get very awkward. I just try to keep quiet whenever something about religion pops up. As you can see, my situation was clearly a lot better than op\u2019s but I still felt like my opinions and beliefs were being disregarded and it doesn\u2019t feel good at all.

They don't leave room for differing beliefs, and they are just *beliefs*, after all.  \n\nI am dead firm in my beliefs, which have no scientific proof whatsoever, but they're MINE.  Anyone else can have other beliefs or no beliefs at all.  It's a deeply personal thing, and if it's literally not harming one when they're alive, it's of no concern to anyone else.", "In some branches, it's also stated that if believers allow non-believers into their lives, the believers' places in heaven would be forfeit.\n\nNTA.  I'm all for religion so long as it never does harm, but it does, so l'm not for it.", "I remember reading about some early priest who was told to 'go convert the heathens' by the pope.  Being afraid of dying, he blessed a river then the Romans (?) drew the Germanic tribes into the waters.\n\nThe priest got to go home and say 'I baptized x many heathens'.", "I believe in God, Jesus, and the Bible. I've raised my children to believe as well but more than believe I want them to know. To know God as I've come to know him. I can not do that by forcing my will on them. The more we try to force our beliefs on others the more resistant they'll become. \n\nEven if they're fear is the damnation of OP's soul the Bible instructs us not to fear or worry. As far as your comment, I see nothing malicious or disrespectful in it, so I do agree that it may Christians who seek to force their beliefs on others.", "\"You know what would show *real* faith, MIL? Give me your house *now*, to show Jesus that you believe his return is imminent.  I mean, you really shouldn't have a house anyway, since you're *supposed* to giving everything to the poor. So come on, I'll even pay the lawyer so you can free yourself of all these worldly things.\"", "The Bible only makes sense if you understand it to be an anthology written by multiple hands, coming from multiple cultures with multiple traditions that were being transcribed into written form.  If you believe it to be the One True Inerrant Word of God, then you're going to have some problems.", "Hell is determined by the company with you.", "What about how awkward and sad it is for you that they dismiss what you believe?\n\nNTA", "You are of sound mind and able to make your own decisions. Don't let them guilt you into their brainwashing. It's going to suck because they are afraid you will be come and adult and no longer be \"under their guidance\". Go free and enjoy your life.

My mom taught us kids that he had an evil heart and was going to hell when he died, where he would burn forever and ever . . . Us kids were terrified. My parents didn't divorce  until all the kids were grown . .  I don't believe any of us are deep into religion . .  I don't trust it . . .  I don't trust the lies they propogate with their bible thumping . . and the hatred and abuse.  I don't believe much love and human kindness comes out of religion . . my personal observations.", "My parents believed in God, but weren't the type that talked about Jesus and God in most conversations. As they got older they started getting a little more religious as my mom battled cancer. I remember some conversations with my dad while my mom was on her deathbed and they were finding strength in God. I on the other hand not so much and even less after I lost my mom. She had just turned 51 so my parents were relatively young.\n\nMy dad got remarried and him and his wife were very much devoted, read the bible every day, work at the church it's a big part of their daily life. Even though he would have liked for me to share in his belief and passion, he never tried to push me to go to church. I remained supportive of him and when he got baptized at the beach I even went in the water with him. \n\nNTA They can have their beliefs and you can have yours, respect is mutual and you don't need to share in their beliefs. I was super close to my dad even though we didn't share views and it never caused issues in our relationship. I just lost him in 2020 and am still close to my step mom.", "NTA. They respect your right to choose your own religion.", "NTA \u2014 and even though I am very religious, though not the same one as your dad and stepmom, people like them set my teeth on edge. I have NEVER understood religions where you either adhere to some human\u2019s standards or their deity sends you to a punishment world. Anyway, not the point. They need to leave you alone about that stuff. If necessary ask your mother to intervene on your behalf.", "NTA -- why is it only disrespectful and awkward that you don't believe what they believe?  Why isn't it just as disrespectful and awkward that they aren't supporting your beliefs?", "NTA, and I commend you for standing up for yourself at such a young age - I wish I had your courage, confidence and sense of self at 17.", "NTA\n\nEverything they're doing is asymmetrical.\n\nWho gets to loudly shove their beliefs on others?   \nThem. But not you!\n\nWho gets to be all weepy and emotional and claim they're being disrespected?  \nThem. But not you!\n\nWho gets to ignore what the other is saying?\nThem. But not you!\n\nEverything they're doing is BS manipulation and incredibly sleazy. (IMO it's actually abuse.)  You are not the one being disrespectful. They are. They're being downright rude.", "Just a thought to put out there. Your parents divorced over your father's conversion to evangelical christianity, and now he has married a similarly evangelical woman from the approved tribe.\nHe can't look, examine, or backtrack because it will cost him his new family, friends, and tribe. And the tribal factor is really really strong in that brand of christianity.  You can argue theology with him, and I probably would (it is likely he has never actually read his holy book cover to cover, it's always cherry picked), and I would probably niggle at whatever cognitive dissonance he might be feeling, but ultimately belief is actually about tribe and belonging and it isn't logical or rational.\n\nAs for their kids - what happens when one of them turns out to be gay or non binary, or just doesn't fit the approved gender roles? Be prepared for potentially have them kick you out of their lives as soon as you turn 18, or when they realise you won't obey their ridiculous orders.", "NTA. Your mom is an absolute superstar for having the wisdom to ensure you were free to make your own choice when you were old enough. Most kids aren't so lucky and end up indoctrinated as all hell. Congrats on your upcoming freedom!", "NTA. Your dad and step-mother are cray-cray and you cannot reason with crazy people. Just keep saying \u201cno\u201d. You don\u2019t owe them respect for their religious beliefs. Hopefully, your younger siblings will learn from your experience.", "NTA They are manipulating you, or at least trying to.  I hate crap like that.", "I guess one could argue that she was in huge emotional distress after realising that her son is rejecting any chance to be saved by god, etc. Some people are really invested in religion. This may have been a genuine reaction. Who knows what this religion says about non belivers and what will happen to them. Some religions are awful", "GNU", "Fucking achievement farmers"]}
