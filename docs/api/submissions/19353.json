Yesterday evening I was in the kitchen preparing a chicken dish.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend (55) came into the kitchen to prepare a salad and asked me if he could use the cutting board. The cutting board and knife were still soaked with chicken juice and had tiny bits of raw chicken on it, so I obviously said no, that he should use the spare one. I was still busy with cooking, but had planned to clean both by hand and then put it in the dishwasher. \n\nI am very cautious about food safety (especially regarding chicken) and I would not have let him used the board, even if he cleaned it by hand. Since I don't trust meat contaminated tools, if they weren't in the dishwasher.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend on the other hand does not believe in food poisoning. He never had it, so obviously it can't exist. I don't know why he is so unreasonable regarding this topic, since he is not like that with other stuff. He is not anti-Vax or anything, it's just food safety he doesn't believe in.  \n\nHe still insisted on using the cutting board and knife. I reminded him of salmonella, to which he just sighed :\" You and your salmonella...\". I replied that if he wants to use it then fine, if he cleans it, it may not be up to my cleaning standards, but I don't have to eat that salad. Well that man did not intend to clean the cutting board, he wanted to cut the vegetables, that he wanted to eat raw, on the dirty cutting board, with the dirty knife. I immediately told him, that he cannot do that and we had a heated discussion. \n\nThis was not the first time we had a fight about food safety and I have more than once refused to eat anything he had prepared. In the past I had grabbed the kitchen utensils out of his hand and ensured that he could not do stupid like that. But this time I was already exhausted from having such a stupid discussion. I was also caught off guard, because he never attempted something so unsafe before. So I thought fine, if he wants to give himself salmonella so badly, then I will not stop him. \nI just warned my Mom how he prepared said salad (she did not eat it) and let him eat his food hazard. \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next.  \nIt's the next day and as expected, he is laying sick in bed. \n\nMy Mom pulled me aside and told me, I should have stopped him from preparing the salad on the cutting board. That I knew what would happen and that it was cruel of me, to let him eat it. \nI responded, that she knew how he prepared it and could have stopped him from eating it. Her reasoning is that there was already an argument, because she refused to eat the salad herself and she did not want to cause another. \n\nI do feel bad that he is know sick, but I tried to talk him out of it and I don't think i should have to physically stop him from doing something stupid like that.

It blows my mind when people don\u2019t take things like this seriously. Never had it before so it can\u2019t exist? He learned real quick what fuckin up looks like.

You let him know what the situation with the cutting board was.", "INFO: So he wasn't willing to even rinse it out in hot water? I know that won't sterilize it, but it may have helped a bit.

This is a grown ass man choosing to disregard decades worth of safety information. Hope he enjoys his salmonella.", "NTA\n\nSo what did your mom think you should have done? Fling yourself over the cutting board and get stabbed in a noble sacrifice? You did what you could do. Also; in private you're allowed to giggle helplessly at his self-inflicted suffering", "NTA. What did she want you to do, tackle him? A grown man should not need this level of saving from his own stupidity. The hard way is the only way some people can learn.", "LOL NTA. They say you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks but\u2026 I think it\u2019s safe to say he won\u2019t try that again.", "NTA. She's using you as a meat shield for her stupid boyfriend. Not your monkey, not your circus. She had every opportunity to stop him, it's not your job to manage a fully grown adult who has been warned.", "He got what he got.", "Let me guess, he'll say it was just a flu bug, and food poisoning still doesn't exist!", "You can't stop adults from doing something. What more can you do, kick their ass?", "NTA it's insane are we talking about a grown adult here ? Or a 6 years old ? You are not his mom you told him more than enough. Let him suffer in his sickness maybe next time he ll learn to wash and will stop being condescendant.", "Maybe mom's upset because she has to baby this theoretically grown ass man while he is sick? He definitely needs babying in the kitchen by OP's description.\n\n\"No, don't use that, you'll get sick!\"\n\n\"No, we have to clean it first!\"\n\n\"You have to wash them if you want to use them!\"\n\nAren't these sentences you'd say to a kid?", "[removed]", ">Her reasoning is that there was **already an argument,** because she refused to eat the salad herself and **she did not want to cause another**. \n\nThe mother is also being an AH to herself and OP by not seeing the argument and the one she {mother} refused to have were 100% caused by him.", "Mom was smart enough to not eat it but isn\u2019t smart enough to get a new boyfriend that doesn\u2019t think he knows everything. NTA", "You just know he did it to prove her wrong and be able to say \u201cI told you so\u201d. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes is often over used, but in this case, it fits perfectly.", "NTA.  But will the boyfriend learn?  I would not be surprised if there is an later update where the BF doubles down to prove that food Poisoning isn't real.", "[removed]", "He seems too stupid to learn any lessons", "NTA. See if he does it again lol", "Lol! No no items", "My 4 year old understands we wash our hands after we put touch raw batter and we can't eat it until it's cooked (he likes to help bake).  This guy is literally behind preschoolers on food safety.", "I just can't imagine being attracted to a person like that", "Mom being pissed has me howling. Her bf is an ass hat and she\u2019s blaming her kid for \u2018letting him\u2019 get sick and trying to make them feel guilty for not having done more to \u2018prevent\u2019 the ass hat from being an ass hat.", "u/Classiftr appears go be a comment stealing bot. Original by u/Crafty_Dog_4674", "u/Aggrahty is a comment stealing bot. Original by u/solo_throwaway254247", "What more were you suppose to do?? You warned him more than once and he basically said \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want\u201d. The only other thing you could do would be to physically stop him and we all know that would have made a worse situation. This is what I hate about most people. Lack of taking responsibility. He needs to take responsibility for his poor decisions and your mom needs to realize who\u2019s really at fault. You told your mom about the situation and she didn\u2019t do anything so isn\u2019t she just as responsible if not more responsible because that\u2019s her boyfriend? I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being punished for someone else\u2019s mistake. Take some time from the situation in your life if you can."]}
