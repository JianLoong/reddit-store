Yesterday evening I was in the kitchen preparing a chicken dish.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend (55) came into the kitchen to prepare a salad and asked me if he could use the cutting board. The cutting board and knife were still soaked with chicken juice and had tiny bits of raw chicken on it, so I obviously said no, that he should use the spare one. I was still busy with cooking, but had planned to clean both by hand and then put it in the dishwasher. \n\nI am very cautious about food safety (especially regarding chicken) and I would not have let him used the board, even if he cleaned it by hand. Since I don't trust meat contaminated tools, if they weren't in the dishwasher.\n\nMy mom's Boyfriend on the other hand does not believe in food poisoning. He never had it, so obviously it can't exist. I don't know why he is so unreasonable regarding this topic, since he is not like that with other stuff. He is not anti-Vax or anything, it's just food safety he doesn't believe in.  \n\nHe still insisted on using the cutting board and knife. I reminded him of salmonella, to which he just sighed :\" You and your salmonella...\". I replied that if he wants to use it then fine, if he cleans it, it may not be up to my cleaning standards, but I don't have to eat that salad. Well that man did not intend to clean the cutting board, he wanted to cut the vegetables, that he wanted to eat raw, on the dirty cutting board, with the dirty knife. I immediately told him, that he cannot do that and we had a heated discussion. \n\nThis was not the first time we had a fight about food safety and I have more than once refused to eat anything he had prepared. In the past I had grabbed the kitchen utensils out of his hand and ensured that he could not do stupid like that. But this time I was already exhausted from having such a stupid discussion. I was also caught off guard, because he never attempted something so unsafe before. So I thought fine, if he wants to give himself salmonella so badly, then I will not stop him. \nI just warned my Mom how he prepared said salad (she did not eat it) and let him eat his food hazard. \n\nYou can probably guess what happened next.  \nIt's the next day and as expected, he is laying sick in bed. \n\nMy Mom pulled me aside and told me, I should have stopped him from preparing the salad on the cutting board. That I knew what would happen and that it was cruel of me, to let him eat it. \nI responded, that she knew how he prepared it and could have stopped him from eating it. Her reasoning is that there was already an argument, because she refused to eat the salad herself and she did not want to cause another. \n\nI do feel bad that he is know sick, but I tried to talk him out of it and I don't think i should have to physically stop him from doing something stupid like that. On the other hand I do feel like an asshole for letting him go trough with it.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1686305757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1451c4i/aita_for_knowingly_letting_my_moms_boyfriend_get/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s bad to touch hot stoves? Don\u2019t run with scissors? Tie your shoelaces so you don\u2019t trip?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. And seriously how can he even be mad since I bet he STILL doesn\u2019t have food poisoning :b", "NTA. This guy is an absolute joke. He\u2019s a grown man and should know better than this. You\u2019re not his mom or his caretaker. The fact that you warned him and he couldn\u2019t care less cemented he\u2019s at fault here. Not you. It blows my mind when people don\u2019t take things like this seriously. Never had it before so it can\u2019t exist? He learned real quick what fuckin up looks like. Hopefully this is a lesson learned and he doesn\u2019t do this crap again.", "Is he 55? Or 5? \n\nHe's not a child that needs to be looked after and told not to touch the flame. You did way too much already. He's a grown-ass man (or just a grown ass). He wants to be stupid, step aside and let him be stupid. \n\n\nNTA. He is. And so is your mum for enabling that bs.\n\nEdited.", "NTA he learned today about salmonella, you tried to tell him but he had to learn the hard way", "NTA but he\u2019s a grown ass man and your mother blames you? This is the one lesson he needed to learn\u2026.don\u2019t mess with chicken !!", "NTA - this is a classic FAFO for the bf.\n\nI learned about basic food safety - cleaning up after handling poultry - when I was maybe 10.  Hard for me to believe someone can reach adulthood and not know about this.   Maybe next time the bf will listen to OP.", "NTA - you warned him, and this wasn\u2019t even the first warning. Hopefully he believes in food poisoning now \ud83d\ude44", "NTA and proven correct.  This was obviously an AH and also got to find out was wrong.  Mom is an AH for expecting OP to manage her BF/relationship where she clearly will not.", " NTA he did this all on his own. You made several attempts to stop him and he refused.", "NTA - Your mom is wrong. You are not responsible for a dummy.", "No! Your mum is an AH and so is her boyfriends it is not your fault he is 1) disgustingly unhygienic, and 2) disregarded your very clear advice. \n\nYou are NTA here!!!", "NTA \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nAnd he\u2019s learned something now\u2026 food poisoning does, in fact, exist. \n\nSound like you tried to warn him and he didn\u2019t listen. That\u2019s not on you.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult who refuses to practice basic food safety. Don\u2019t feel bad one bit for this idiot.", "NTA.  He is a grown up, you told him about the danger he decided to do it anyway.  This is totally on him.", "NTA. You have talked about this multiple times before. You tried to stop him, you warned him and he didn't listen. Even your mum refusing to eat it didn't stop him from eating the salad. This is the consequences of his decision, let him suffer. Maybe at his big age he'll finally learn to use clean kitchen utensils and take food safety seriously.", "NTA. You went above and beyond to prevent that. Sure you sound a bit paranoid about the topic but it's common sense to wash the board and the knife after cutting raw meat.", "You very much did not let him, you told him not to repeatedly. You told him that he \u201ccannot do that\u201d. \n\nNTA - he is a moron and your mom is out of her mind", "NTA. Some people just have to learn the hard way. Even your mother knows not to bother because he just does whatever anyway.", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes.\n\nEdit to ask...why didn't your mum stop him? She didn't eat the salad.", "NTA. he\u2019s a grown ass man and you even warned him about it, he still did it. that\u2019s on him. hope he starts to believe in food poisoning now\u2026", "NTA. A good case of fuck around n find out. \nYou warned him, and he didn\u2019t listen, I mean, what can you do? You\u2019re not his parent, lol", "NTA. You warned him and your mum. She chose not to eat it because she knew it would get her ill. She is TA for not standing up to her husband and not telling him he is being pretty damn stupid.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA. We\u2019re you supposed to physically restrain him? You told him not to and you told him why.", "NTA. Imagine having to treat a 55 year old man like a toddler and take no-no items out of his hand to stop him from doing something stupid.", "NTA and this is actually hilarious! What kind of geek moron just \"Doesn't believe in Salmonella\"?? Does he believe in it now? Lesson learned, move on with life. You are most definitely NTA! Feel free to tell him \\*I\\* said \\*HE\\* is TA!! 8)", "NTA. You tried your best. This section below makes me feel very sad for your mother. \n\n>\tshe knew how he prepared it and could have stopped him from eating it. Her reasoning is that there was already an argument, because she refused to eat the salad herself and she did not want to cause another.", "NTA\n\nHe's an adult, you tried reason. \nHopefully he'll learn from this.", "NTA. You let him know what the situation with the cutting board was.", "INFO: So he wasn't willing to even rinse it out in hot water? I know that won't sterilize it, but it may have helped a bit. I know he wouldn't have listened, but did you try telling him that you have a separate cutting board for vegetables since foods served raw should never be prepared on a board used to prepare meat. Even if it has been thru the dishwasher. You do have separate boards, correct?\n\nNTA", "This is one of those stories that don\u2019t seem real, but just in case NTA. Mom could have stopped him from earning since she was aware of the situation", "NTA and he is a fool and even your mother was smart enough not to eat it but she blames you when you warned him and  your mother knew better and she did not force him not to eat it. \n\nI guess he learned his lesson and won\u2019t do that again \n\nIt is not your fault", "Nta you tried to warn and stop them. Yeah your mom feels guilty but what else could you have done realistically. What keep the knife and cutting bored away by force that? Some people need to learn lessons just be glad your mom listened. Now that guy either pays attention or tries to act like that wasn't the cause and show how insane he is.", "What were you supposed to do? Fight this guy? Tell a grown man what to do in his own girlfriend's home? You tried. Nta", "NTA but your mom kinda is for telling you to be more responsible instead of laughing at her BF for being faced with the consequences of his own actions.", "NTA. Your mom is kind of a jerk, though.", "Oh good grief. He's a grown man. If his food poisoning is anything like mine was he's just let himself in for years of trouble, not just an uncomfortable few days.  How can you not believe in something because you haven't bag or?  I haven't had cancer, thank God, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  He'll change his mind soon enough.", "NTA idk how he doesn\u2019t believe in food poisoning but maybe this will finally teach him. You did explain it and argue with him, he just wouldn\u2019t listen. Not your fault", "You told him what was going to happen he ignored it and earned himself a one way ticket to shitsville. What more could you do, and if you did more imagine the arguments. Nope not your problem", "Mom just figured since bf was already mad at op, op could just be the bad guy and MAKE him do the right thing ?!? Mom and bf deserve each other, and op has a great cocktail story to tell when she gets home from her visit. NTA, and op needs feel absolutely zero guilt for the schadenfreude she reaped from this situation.", " There were several spare clean cutting boards and knife's. I think he was already mad and felt that I was treating him like a toddler, so he probably wanted to prove that I was overreacting. And no he did not want to clean the utensils in smallest kind of way."]}
