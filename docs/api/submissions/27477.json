Since it seems you have a great relationship with him, maybe approach him with something like, \"mom mentioned you'd like X to come too the wedding, and I'd love that, but I need some help to do that. Since there's not enough in our budget to include them, would you be willing to pay their costs?\" \nOf course, that's assuming you don't have an issue with that part of the family attending. I know you said you're not close to them, but it's important to your stepfather.

He had no fun making you; that was someone else.", "I feel like I pretty well covered that in the 2nd sentence.", "I am replying to you because I would like to understand your point of view and at the same time I want you to understand my situation. I don't want him to pay for his relatives because I can't. I want him to pay for them because they would be invited solely because of him. Their presence is not important to me. And I am not so well off to pay that amount of money for people who I wouldn't miss at all.", "I don't owe him because I didn't ask him to raise me. It was his decision.\n\nAre you a type of person who thinks children owe their parent with the world just because they did their duty while raising them?\n\nI didn't ask to be born. I didn't ask to be a stepdaughter. I have never did anything for my parents because of owing them. It was my mom's decision to have me and it was my stepdad's decision to marry my mom. I do things for them because of love. And not because of your f-ed up logic.\n\nThere was someone else who told me I am TA and I - however disagreeing with them - I saw their point if view.\n\nBut I cannot see yours. Might be a cultural difference or something else. We just simply think about step-parenting differently.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if you asked for it or not. You benefited from it. Huge difference between a biological parent having a responsibility and a stepparent having a responsibility.  \n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask to be born, and your stepfather didn\u2019t ask you to be born either.\n\nYou never heard of something called gratitude?", "I am grateful to him. But I don't owe him. I am willing to invite his relatives because I love him and yes because of gratitude. But I don't think I should be paying for them. These relatives did not invite me. Not at their own expense or on anyone else's. I think it's generous enough of me to be willing to invite them.", "You know what I find really interesting that even my stepdad doesn't think the same way about gratitude and obligation as you. I don't consider him stepdad. He is my dad to me. I am not a stepdaughter to him. I am his daughter. He looks at me the same way he looks at my half-sister (his bio child). Owing him and such things were never a topic in our household. We are a family. He didn't raise my elder sister and me because it was his goal to raise us. He loved (and still loves) our mom and he accepted that mom is in a package with us. The only reason why we don't call him dad because we know our father and he is not a good person so we don't really like this word. Your approach is totally out of the issue when it comes to our family.", "Technically, you don\u2019t owe him. But it would be a display of gratitude and decent. And you\u2019re not doing it for the relatives; you\u2019re doing it for your stepfather, the man who raised you.", "Then, why did you call him your stepdad in the title? And you don\u2019t know how he feels about the situation. He obviously wants you to invite these relatives, despite the fact that they did not invite you to their own weddings.\n\nYes, you were a package deal. But a lot of men likely turned your mom down because of you.", "Because he is not my bio dad. I stated facts there. I know how he behaved in the past 18 years, you don't.\n\nIf a lot of men turned my mom down it's on them. Still not part of the discusson. It was his choice. If I make a choice about which other people, especially children cannot do anything I do not use it as a weapon against them 20 years later. Nor does my stepdad (who I call by his first name in real life btw). He simply expressed his wishes to my mom. And I am willing to make his wish come true if that is important to him. But not on my dime when he is totally able to pay for it.", "Nta but just invite his dad. If he starts insisting on the others, then revoke his dads invite. period", "Nta, you aren't close to them , they aren't close to you,  they didn't invite you to anything, so why would you invite them.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding that you are paying for and only want people you are very close with to be there. It\u2019s your moment, not theirs. Invite who you want and if someone has a problem with that it says more about them than it does about you.", "NTA do t invite them. They did not invite you to their weddings so why would you invite them?!", "NTA, but you're going to have to suck it up and talk to him.  Frame it like you have here - you only have enough money to invite 25 guests, which means making some difficult decisions.  You will avoid hurt feelings if you confront this head-on, letting it fester will do the opposite.", "NTA: you already stated the guestlist is set at 55 persons, close family and friends.", "So a basic rule is that you do not have to invite somebody to your wedding if they did not invite you to theirs. Obviously you have to have known them and been alive at that point in time lol we can't say you didn't invite me 35 years ago, but being that one of the weddings was earlier this year that absolutely fits inside that criteria.\n\nI think you need to bypass your mother and sit down and speak to your stepfather and explain to him that you feel that they don't see you as family as you have not been invited to any weddings, christenings are other events on their side of the family even though you've been his stepdaughter for x amount of years. As such you don't feel like it would be fair for you to invite them to your wedding because you don't want to send an invitation they might be uncomfortable declining. But clearly, at this point they have showed that you are not important to them. I would probably invite his father though. I think that shows that you're willing to accept his family there but there's no need to invite every single one of them because you're just not close.", "NTA.\n\nI would explain to him your reasons for not inviting them. I mean, they had the chance to build a relationship, but did not want to, did not include you in anything, so in my opinion they made it quite clear they don't view you as family. So in my eyes there's no need to spend a month's salary on somebody you'll never have a relationship with.\n\nIf you're looking for a compromise because you love your stepdad: Maybe inviting his father would be enough. I'm not even sure his father would come, but if it means the world to your stepdad, maybe that's a way to go.", "NTA but maybe have a conversation with stepdad, let him know what your mom told you and tell him that since you weren\u2019t invited to their events and aren\u2019t otherwise close with them, it doesn\u2019t make sense to invite them to your wedding", "NTA if it would mean so much to stepdad that his family be invited to your wedding why didn\u2019t he do more over the years to foster a relationship?", "NTA\n\nI had to do the same for my Dads extended family. It would have been another 40 people or so and run us about 4K. I told my Dad I hadn\u2019t seen those people in a decade so if he wanted them there then he had to pay for it himself. He ultimately chose not to invite them and I was honestly happy about it but him paying for them would have been a fair compromise. \n\nIf you decide to make that offer be clear these are the only additional people you\u2019re willing to add because you love SD and respect his desire to invite his family even though you don\u2019t know them.", "NTA. It's completely reasonable to ask him to cover his extra family that you don't know well so he can invite them.", "All good details and valid thinking expressed in your question and the background details you provided. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be TAH, but I think you could approach it in a different way. You might consider discussing, with either just your mom or both your mom and step-dad, the financial concerns. Since the financial limitations and enlist their help in thinking of the best solution. If your step father isn\u2019t asking for his family\u2019s inclusion then it could be approached as you explained it here. If he has asked then you could share the other details and ask for them to help with coming up with ideas to see the level of importance to him. Maybe he\u2019d be OK with just his father being invited?", "It would mean a lot to him, I am sure, but there are likely several other friends or family who would also be touched by an invite! I think that you are NTA, especially when you tell him in a kind way that you cannot afford to invite, say, your best friend from elementary school or even more of the relatives ***you do know well.***. If he feels super emotional about it, come back days later and say that the only way you can afford to do it and keep a small wedding, is for him to pay for those added guests. If I was in his shoes, I might be willing to pay for my family to be there too, but would be most concerned about what ***my*** step child felt", "It\u2019s good you\u2019re talking to your stepdad and mom about this. Since it\u2019s important to him and he\u2019s important to you, ask if he will cover the additional cost associated with his family attending. It sounds like he\u2019d understand the financial implications for you. Some or all of his family may or may not attend because they really aren\u2019t close to you. And don\u2019t worry about them feeling out of the loop because they don\u2019t know anyone else. That\u2019s on them to handle. If they will feel uncomfortable, they won\u2019t come. We\u2019ve all been to events where we didn\u2019t know many people and we just deal with it, so it\u2019s really not an issue.", "1.  You cannot ask your step-father to cover the cost of his family unless you ask everyone else to pay their own way.  Bad taste.\n2.  He is probably very proud of the family that's developed with your mom and you.  He wants his family to see this.\n3.  Invite your step-father's father and pay the cost (1 extra).  These occasions mean alot as we get older.  Invest in your family ties.  You will be old one day.\n4.  If your step-father persists that it would mean alot to have the others there tell him you and your fiance are keeping it small.  Don't mention the added cost because he might volunteer to pay for them and you really don't want them there.  Good luck.", "NTA, as many people have said, it is your day. But, it sounds like your Step-Father is a pretty important figure in your life, and it\u2019s possible he wants to celebrate you and how proud he is with his family. \n\nI say forget the \u201cthey didn\u2019t invite me\u201d attitude and have a conversation with your step dad, explain that inviting them will put you over your budget. If it really means that much to him, he might offer to help cover that cost. If not, you\u2019ve expressed your concerns. \n\nThat is just my 2-cents.\n\nEdit: Best wishes on your upcoming nuptials.", "Nta if I only made 690 a month I wouldn\u2019t even have a wedding. I think maybe your step father should offer to help with some of the wedding expenses period.", "Is stepdad giving you away? That may be why it\u2019s so important  to him. Regardless, you wouldn\u2019t be the AH requesting he pay for them. They\u2019re more his guests than yours.  Felicitations!", "It\u2019s not important enough for him to actually tell you himself. And it wasn\u2019t important for you to attend any of their weddings. So I wouldn\u2019t even bother offering him the chance to pay for them to attend. You\u2019re having a small wedding, a bunch of near-strangers might have an impact on the atmosphere.", "Have him pay. He can invite who he wants but pay for them.", "The problem is this wedding isn't about what's important to him. This wedding is about what is important to you and your fiancee. You want an intimate wedding with those closest to you that you can afford. That's what you should have.", "NTA, but you can ask for help to invite them. Just try to be gentle with words and explain the financial struggle.", "Mom may just be stirring the pot.", "Tell your mom it would mean a lot to you if they pay for their plates.", "I know this sounds crazy but why don't you just talk to him? Surely you can gage how much this would mean to by having a conversation. Maybe it was just a passing thought, maybe just his dad could be invited. This post could have been a text.", "Is it possible to tell him that you understand that it means a lot to him but from your perspective, you are not as important to them by giving examples so maybe it is better that only his father is invited. Why would they want to attend your wedding when you were not invited to theirs and he could or may have extended himself by asking them to invite you ?", "Struggling to see why they'd be at their uncle's daughter's wedding if their uncle himself didn't even make the wedding cut.", "I think they weren't invited because those were really small wedding ceremonies without a reception only for immediate family. One of the girls was 7 months pregnant at her wedding. It's an f-ed up reasoning in my opinion as there is no way that an uncle I knew my whole life and has a relationship with isn't considered immediate family. But that might be the reason...", "If they don't even consider their uncle immediate family you would seem to be pretty far removed for them to be invited to your wedding.", "Hon they had a shot gun wedding. Your stepdad wasnt on their radar. My immediate family is my parents and siblings NOT my aunts and uncles. Youre NTA but dont get confused that they were TA for not inviting you guys.", "Totally agree. This is why it's the best to describe it as below:\n\nI did not decide to not invite them after thinking about it. I didn't even take them into consideration when making the guest list.\n\nYes they are relatives but we literally have no relationship.", "I don't think she implies that. She just described the non-existent relationship by mentioning that she was not invited to anything in all the years she has been her stepdad's family member.", "Her wedding and her guest list, man. It\u2019s OP\u2019s call to honor her stepdad\u2019s request or not, not yours.", "Technically, legally and morally she doesn\u2019t owe him. She doesn\u2019t owe him a bunch of invites to her wedding in any sense. You can bleat about it until the cows come home, but that doesn\u2019t make it true.", "NTA if you weren\u2019t invited to their events then you have NO obligation to invite them to yours. If he wants them there then it is on him to cover their cost.", "NTA the need to board that vicious dog and I'm a dog guy. \n\nAnd why doesn't your mom come visit?", "NTA if they are not invited.\nHaving said that, is there room to invite his dad simply because it would mean a lot to your step dad?", "NTA - he just wants to show off and prove you are more welcoming than they are", "NTA\n\nBut this may be a conversation that you may not have to make.  \n\nSounds like you get on well with your stepdad.  You weren't invited to your uncle's wedding (and he and your mom were) and none of you were invited to his kids.  You are not close at all.\n\nThere may not be an expectation of an invitation... especially when everyone knows it's a small intimate wedding.\n\nYour mom sounds like she's trying to make this a bigger deal than it is.\n\nYou could speak to your stepdad privately and tell him that you had no intentions of inviting his brother and their families to your wedding and you hope there was no expectations of that.  If he says there were, then you could suggest he pay because you can't afford it.  I'm guessing your mom didn't say she'd pay for them.", "You can invite his dad if it means a lot to them. Others should have extended you the same courtesy of inviting you to their wedding\nEdit : or you can have a talk with your step dad. Tell him your mom talked to you about inviting his extended family for marriage. You would love to invite them but currently you don't have the budget for that.  Ask him is there any particular persons he would think you must invite and you can try to find a solution to invite them too", "Speak to your stepdad about this. Say honestly what you said here - you don't want people whom you don't really know to attend your wedding. Just that. You don't have to explain anything, that is reason enough.", "That is actually not a bad salary here. I mean compared to other wages. I am actually a lawyer, lol. When it comes to comparison with prices... That's a different story.\nMinimum wage is about $421. A loaf of white bread is $2,2, and rent for a 56 m2 flat on the 2nd floor without an elevator near the train station which is a quite dangerous neighbourhood is $308. Don't speak about cheese prices. It hurts a lot.", "Yes he is.", "Tell your mom sorry, but your wedding reception is very small and you and your fiance are only inviting people who you know well and who have been very present in your lives.\n\n**Do** ***not*** **offer to invite them if he pays for their plates.**\n\nStepdad is clearly not that close to these family members. He just wants them there to show off to them -- sort of a \"fuck you\" to them for not inviting him to their weddings, to show how much bigger person he is than they are. That's not a valid reason for you to invite them.\n\nPlease stop feeling guilty about this. There is nothing here for you to feel guilty about. If mom persists, tell her that if he wants to spend time with his family members, she and your stepdad are quite welcome to throw their own party and invite them.", "Absolutely not. She's not that kind of person.", "Agree with both assessments.  In that particular instance, it sounds like it was a rushed shotgun/courthouse wedding.  Immediate family is siblings, parents, and children in that case.  No cousins, grandparents, or aunts/uncles.  Ops cousin in law has no obligation to invite anyone to such an event.\n\nIt's much more telling, though, that none of these people  have thought to include you in their lives at all since you were six.  I think it's totally understandable not wanting them there given their current involvement in your life.\n\nI wouldn't phrase it as your step dad has to pay for them though, that makes it sound like the decision is entirely financial, which might make it feel from his perspective that you are the ahole... plus, he might call your bluff.\n\nThis is, of course, assuming you don't actually want a relationship with these people.  On the flip side, this could be an excellent opportunity to reach across the isle and build a bridge to that particular segment of your family."]}
