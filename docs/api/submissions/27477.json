Since it seems you have a great relationship with him, maybe approach him with something like, \"mom mentioned you'd like X to come too the wedding, and I'd love that, but I need some help to do that. Since there's not enough in our budget to include them, would you be willing to pay their costs?\" \nOf course, that's assuming you don't have an issue with that part of the family attending. I know you said you're not close to them, but it's important to your stepfather.

The only possible exception is stepdad's father. Perhaps that could be a compromise? You invite one additional person instead of five? Edit:oh, it seems you're from Hungary. So that wouldn't be a cultural thing to invite them even though you didn't get invitations to their ceremonies. And I would say what they did was rather rude. Nope, stepdad's siblings don't get a pass here. Grandpa can be possibly excused though.", "Whishes probably you mean. And tell your mom.

It's a tough situation - he has been good to you, but his family certainly has not!", "I would invite his father and cover the cost of him. The rest step dad should cover if he wants them to come", "NTA but still proceed with caution being clear that the offer is ONLY for those select people", "Yeah see here\u2019s the problem if you do accept this your most likely going to run into more problems of your family wanting to invite more people. You gotta start standing your ground cause they may see this as an opportunity to invite more people if they cover the cost. Then next thing you know you got 100+ people invited to your wedding and then half of those people you don\u2019t even know very well or like. Do you want to meet new people at your wedding?

I\u2019ll cut him some slack he probably didn\u2019t know how to bring it up to since your not close to his family.

Please don't grab out half sentences. It actually means that however I don't want them there I wouldn't mind them attending my wedding if their absence would make my stepdad sad.", "You are right. He isn't owe me anything. And I don't owe him anything. If I do something I do it out of love. And not because of expectations. I really don't see why should I pay for 5 literal strangers on a small wedding because he decided to marry my mom.", "Bizarre may have been a strong word for me to use. Perhaps I should have said not reasonable.", "It's YOU and YOUR Fiancee's day and you want to be surrounded and supported by people that are important to you two, not some random step family members who you barely know.", "He was invited to his brother's wedding (alongside with mom) but they weren't invited to his nieces' weddings (ceremonies).", "Yup exactly this! There\u2019s no need to invite like her step dads Necie\u2019s nephews cousins and ect when she barely knows them!", "Then your question should have simply been \"AITA for asking my StepDad to pay for his extra relatives I can't afford to invite to my wedding?\" \n\nInstead you threw in all the extra detail about how and why you just don't want them at your wedding---which is a legit idea and something you can decide for your day.

Let's agree to disagree now.", "I think maybe allow your step dad to send pictures of the wedding to them and maybe have you and your step dad take pictures together for him to send to people. But in the end even in your comments it really seems like you don\u2019t really want them to come but your doing it out of guilt. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about something like this.", "You do owe him. He raised you and gave you a much better life than you would\u2019ve had otherwise.. He had no fun making you; that was someone else.", "I feel like I pretty well covered that in the 2nd sentence.", "I am replying to you because I would like to understand your point of view and at the same time I want you to understand my situation. I don't want him to pay for his relatives because I can't. I want him to pay for them because they would be invited solely because of him. Their presence is not important to me. And I am not so well off to pay that amount of money for people who I wouldn't miss at all.", "I don't owe him because I didn't ask him to raise me. It was his decision.\n\nAre you a type of person who thinks children owe their parent with the world just because they did their duty while raising them?\n\nI didn't ask to be born. I didn't ask to be a stepdaughter. I have never did anything for my parents because of owing them. It was my mom's decision to have me and it was my stepdad's decision to marry my mom. I do things for them because of love. And not because of your f-ed up logic.\n\nThere was someone else who told me I am TA and I - however disagreeing with them - I saw their point if view.\n\nBut I cannot see yours. Might be a cultural difference or something else. We just simply think about step-parenting differently.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if you asked for it or not. You benefited from it. Huge difference between a biological parent having a responsibility and a stepparent having a responsibility.  \n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask to be born, and your stepfather didn\u2019t ask you to be born either.\n\nYou never heard of something called gratitude?", "I am grateful to him. But I don't owe him. I am willing to invite his relatives because I love him and yes because of gratitude. But I don't think I should be paying for them. These relatives did not invite me. Not at their own expense or on anyone else's. I think it's generous enough of me to be willing to invite them.", "You know what I find really interesting that even my stepdad doesn't think the same way about gratitude and obligation as you. I don't consider him stepdad. He is my dad to me. I am not a stepdaughter to him. I am his daughter. He looks at me the same way he looks at my half-sister (his bio child). Owing him and such things were never a topic in our household. We are a family. He didn't raise my elder sister and me because it was his goal to raise us. He loved (and still loves) our mom and he accepted that mom is in a package with us. The only reason why we don't call him dad because we know our father and he is not a good person so we don't really like this word. Your approach is totally out of the issue when it comes to our family.", "Technically, you don\u2019t owe him. But it would be a display of gratitude and decent. And you\u2019re not doing it for the relatives; you\u2019re doing it for your stepfather, the man who raised you.", "Then, why did you call him your stepdad in the title? And you don\u2019t know how he feels about the situation. He obviously wants you to invite these relatives, despite the fact that they did not invite you to their own weddings.\n\nYes, you were a package deal. But a lot of men likely turned your mom down because of you.", "Because he is not my bio dad. I stated facts there. I know how he behaved in the past 18 years, you don't.\n\nIf a lot of men turned my mom down it's on them. Still not part of the discusson. It was his choice. If I make a choice about which other people, especially children cannot do anything I do not use it as a weapon against them 20 years later. Nor does my stepdad (who I call by his first name in real life btw). He simply expressed his wishes to my mom. And I am willing to make his wish come true if that is important to him. But not on my dime when he us totally able to pay for it."]}
