The day before, however, I started my menstrual cycle.  Husband declared that our anniversary was now ruined.  For background info- my periods are usually very painful and we normally do not have sex during that time.  So the next morning on our anniversary, he told me that he had plans for us to stay overnight at a hotel nearby so that we could have a night away from our teenagers\u2026\u2026 BUT that since I started my period, he cancelled it.  That didn\u2019t actually bother me though.  I honestly was glad that we didn\u2019t need to spend extra money on a room.  \n  We chose not to exchange gifts this year too, since it\u2019s so close to Christmas.  The new plan was to grab lunch together, and then have dinner later in the evening.  On the way to lunch, husband started complaining that this is not how he wanted the day to go and told me \u201cif you weren\u2019t bleeding right now we\u2019d be in a hotel right now having sex\u201d.  At this point now I\u2019m getting irritated, especially because we have an active sex life outside of my monthly cycles.  I asked him to please drop it before I get upset and the day gets ruined.  He agreed and then we had lunch.  \n  When we got back home, we didn\u2019t have sex, but other things were done\u2026..and let\u2019s just say I took care of him.  A little later we had to be at our son\u2019s school for an awards event and the plan was to have dinner together afterwards.  \n  We get back home and my husband\u2019s mood completely changed again.  He brought up the hotel again and how I\u2019m \u201ctoo bloody to do anything\u201d.  I told him that he was making me feel really horrible for something that I have no control over.  He said he knows, but that he just really wanted to have sex.  And that he had a whole plan for the night.   I asked if we could celebrate and do his hotel idea once my period is over but he said what\u2019s the point.\n   So I\u2019m trying to save the night still, asking where he wants to go eat dinner.  He said nowhere and that he didn\u2019t feel like going out now.  So I offered DoorDash and said I would make us some drinks.  Nope, wasn\u2019t good enough.  He poured himself a glass of whiskey and told me to clean the kitchen and dining room.  Didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of the night.  \n  After re-playing the whole day again, I realized that he hadn\u2019t hugged me, kissed me, or given me any kind of physical touch.  It made me really sad and I feel like I\u2019m just some sex object now.  \n  This morning he told me that he\u2019s willing to give me a chance to make it up to him.  Umm, excuse me???  I told him I don\u2019t need to make up anything because I did nothing wrong.  Now his silent treatment has continued.

I'd welcome his silence since every time he opens his mouth, he shows what an asshole he is. NTA", "Not only are you NTA but also I am concerned for you.  \n\nIs this new behavior on his part? \nIt sounds like he belittles your contributions to the relationship and family, diminishes your worth, and shows little self control and practically zero frustration tolerance. \n\nDo you have support from people nearby? A friend who is aware of this dynamic?  Please consider your health and safety here.", "NTA Let's get this straight. He kept complaining like a little child about something out of your hands. You \"took care of him\" which obviously means you selflessly pleasured him, probably a blow job?\n\nYour reward was more moaning, zero affection and an order to clean up the kitchen.\n\nI actually read the last sentence as \"He wanted to make it up to you\" in that he realised he had been a boor. Don't worry, I read it a second time. \n\nThere is an asshole here and it's him. In particular his going on, and on about something that happens, you did not plan to have happen, could not prevent happening and did the best fix you could.\n\nI get being disappointed, sure your body's timing sucked. But he was strongly the asshole for repeating himself. Everything subsequent is just more assholery\n\nYou are being abused by a selfish probably a narcissist.", "Nta - dump this dude. If he wants a sex doll he can go get one.", "NTA but I\u2019m horrified and disgusted by your post. Did the man hit his head hard on something recently or is this a typical attitude?

I\u2019m sorry you have this sort of person in your life.", "NTA. Your husband is selfish and emotionally abusive.  If he's old enough to have teenagers, he's plenty old enough to know that you have no control whatsoever over when you're on your period.

This anniversary behavior with \u201cpunishment\u201d and you making it up to him- that sounds abusive.\n\nAn anniversary is for both of you to celebrate and mark the occasion and it\u2019s not just about having an opportunity to have sex. \n\nWhat happens when you are sick or for some reason can\u2019t have sex for a period of time?

Your husband needs a SERIOUS reality check. Fuck that! Tell him he can have all the sex he wants\u2026it\u2019s called his HAND. Not to mention, it\u2019s not like you left him hanging! Not sure I could control my anger if I were you. Kudos!\n\nTOTALLY NTA\n\nETA: I\u2019m also concerned that there are teenagers overhearing these moments since it happens every month.

I'd ignore him and tell him you'll be waiting for his apology over his behavior", "Witaf??? Not only are you NOT the asshole, but your husband is a massive d***. That's a disgusting,  deplorable way to treat his wife. Is he always like this? He legit sounds like he is emotionally abusive to you.", "Does he typically order you to clean?", "Oh, you are not in any way the problem here.  Do you have a support system?  family? friends?  He is emotionally and sexually abusive.  I would divorce him in a second.  I suggest therapy, individual therapy for you...not marriage therapy, never go to therapy with your abuser, they just learn to get better at it.  Get out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband needs help. Is this a pattern for him?", "NTA.  This is why I don't date baby men who are afraid of menstruation. He needs help and you need a spa day away from his judgemental ass", "Does he not know that women DO NOT have control over this bodily function!?\nYou don't deserve this kind of treatment. It is selfish, childish, and abusive. \nGet out while you can. You are more than a source for sex. NTA", "NTA. Red flag! Red Flag! He's being petulant and belittling you. Really not good signs.", "NTA. Divorce", "NTA but I\u2019m amazed you\u2019re still with him.", "NTA and this is indicative of more concerning behavior. \nWhat happens if you can't have sex for a few weeks due to injury or childbirth?

All he cared about was getting his  dick wet. He didn't care about you, he didn't care about you felt, he didn't care about making the day special for you. He has an expectation that you perform him and treats you poorly when he doesn't get it. That isn't ok.\n\nMy ex was much the same.\n\nAlso, however you take care of him it was more than he deserved. You don't have to make up for shit. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nEven if you\u2019re married, **you are never obligated to please him sexually**. You are worth more than just being someone he can do the do with in a hotel. Jesus Christ.\n\nMy man is also an incredibly sexual person. If I\u2019m on my period or otherwise not wanting to have sex, he does not get mad and pout like a kid who was told he\u2019s not getting what he wants for his birthday. If I want to \u2018take care of him\u2019 I can, but I don\u2019t feel obligated to, and we\u2019re both more than happy to actually spend time with each other and enjoy each others company without being attached at the genitals. \n\nThis is just icky.", "NTA \n\nHe is so TA.

Your husband is though.", "NTA, obviously.  I notice not a single person responding has thought your husband is in the right.  I\u2019m glad you are trying to get full-time work, but maybe it would be worthwhile getting some legal advice, taking steps to get a seperate bank account he can\u2019t access, gathering important documents, like birth certificates, insurance, tax documents etc.  I have a feeling your husband is the type to have affairs and might force things to a conclusion before you are ready.
