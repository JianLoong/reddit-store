I told her to get the fuck out of my house and never come back. She wailed all the way back to her boyfriend's car.\n\nI admit I think I went too far.

Apparently this is the unpopular opinion, but I stand by it.\n\nLike you said, addiction is a disease. Maybe she's doing better now and would like to be a part of her daughter's life. I get that you love Lucy and have been a big part of her life, but don't get to decide whether her bio mom also becomes a part of her life now, and you don't get to define whether she's a mother or not. Throwing that in her face just seems unnecessary and cruel. \n\n I understand that Lucy didn't recognize her, but has it occured to you that maybe in the longer term, having her bio mom involved in her life could be better for her? Are you completely thinking about Lucy, or just reacting based on your emotions? \n\nI feel like you're acknowledging that addiction is a disease but still really judging her for it. I would also really like to know what her sex life has to do with it. Why is her \"sleeping around\" relevant? This also comes across as extremely judgmental. \n\nShe shouldnt have showed up unannounced or had a temper tantrum. But you essentially had a temper tantrum back. And while your partner may have brought Lucy inside, she may have still overheard your tantrum too. \n\nAgain, not saying the bio mom is innocent here. ESH. But maybe try put yourself in her shoes for a minute. She has obviously had a really shitty time struggling with addiction (btw there's a very very strong link between addiction and trauma so you may not know everything she's been through or why she turned to drugs). And she sees you calling Lucy your daughter, calling her an egg donor, saying she's *your* baby, sees Lucy calling you mom. This was probably really painful. I get that you've played a part in raising her while her mother has been absent and I'm sure you have lots of valid feelings about it. But she has her side of the story and feelings too.", "ESH - Stay out of it.  It's not \"your\" baby.  You made a difficult situation worse.

The best thing to do is to try and support her having a relationship with her mother, while keeping her safe, however much that goes against your instincts.", "ESH Sure Natalie sounds like the worst Mum. However she is a bio mum and you have not adopted Lucy and (even if you had) Lucy deserves to know where she comes from. \n\nThis is the kind of situation where people have adult meetings with social workers to make a plan for what would be in Lucy\u2019s best interests.", "Adding to the trauma and drama of the situation is never good for the child. That person knows she messed up but is too dysfunctional to understand or admit it. You could have gotten her to leave more discreetly, thereby setting an example for how mature adults and strong and loving parents handle difficult situations. Yes, the child needs to be protected from the birth mother but your response wasn't the best IMO.", "ESH. She shouldn't have shown up causing a scene unannounced. But she's *not* your baby. This was not your fight to have, it was your partners. You overstepped. You did go too far.\n\nAnd I don't believe she has anything to do with a four year old being in therapy for something that you claim all happened when she was an infant.", "NTA\n\nI 100% get why you're protective, and I would be too. Plus she had no right to show up at your house and cause a scene.\n\nBut, unpopular opinion, she MIGHT deserve to be a Mom. If shes clean, and has turned her life around. She may never be the full time Mom figure in her daughter's life, but she deserves to know her Mom if it's a healthy relationship.
