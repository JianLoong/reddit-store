Lucy's biological mother Natalie (30F) has lost all physical and legal rights to her daughter due to neglecting her severely when Lucy was an infant, not to get into great detail but Natalie is addicted to opioids and Lucy had a withdrawal period. \n\nLucy and I have gotten close as I have dated my fiance for almost 4 years, Lucy was born 9 months before I came into Brandon's life, we met at the hospital as Lucy had some major health issues in her infancy due to Natalie and I have a chronic illness that pushes me into pancreatitis. She now calls me Mama even though neither I nor my fiance asked her to do so. I read her bedtime stories and I'm helping her learn to add and subtract.\n\nDuring a get-together for Brandon's birthday I hosted at his house, Natalie showed up with her new boyfriend neither were invited. She tried to give Lucy a hug but Lucy didn't know her. She came to Brandon and me instead and told us a stranger had come. She then asked me to make up her plate because  Natalie began to throw a tantrum in the middle of the party shouting about how she was going to take Brandon to court and because she's the mom she'll win full custody because she deserves to be in her daughter's life. During this time Brandon took Lucy inside because she had started crying because she was scared. \n\nI admit I snapped. I told her she has no right to call herself a mother because she abandoned Lucy to go get high and sleep around. She hurt my baby so bad that she's 4 and needs to go to therapy and has physical health issues because of her. That she refuses to put her baby first and at best she's an egg donor. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and never come back. She wailed all the way back to her boyfriend's car.\n\nI admit I think I went too far. I know that drug addiction is a disease and people who suffer from substance abuse disorder need help, I think I went too far saying she was at best an egg donor. Brandon said I did nothing wrong.

Bio Mom had no consideration for the effect her behavior would have on Lucy.  She sounds as self centered as she ever was.  That's not from addiction. Your priority is to protect that little girl, and that's what you did.", "Next time she shows up call the police.  \nAlso lock down Lucy\u2019s school, doctors offices, everywhere and make it clear Lucy is not to leave with anyone other than you or her father.  \nGet cameras for the front and back of your house. Get dashcams for your cars.  \nYou are NTA. But bio mom is scary.", "I think you did the right thing and it might have been good for her to hear such a thing. This doesn't exclude later contacts in a more controlled setting, given that professional help is provided.\n\nYou are her mother, as far as I am concerned.\\*\n\nNTA\n\n\\*EDIT: The little girl's, of course.", "NTA. You\u2019re the hero here", "NTA\n\nYou did not go too far. The truth can be painful, especially for a fuck up like Natalie. The only mistake you made was allowing Natalie to stay past the first ten seconds of her intrusion. She was stripped of her rights for a reason. Continue to protect Lucy - however that need arises.", "You can tell anyone what you want. However the consequences for what you say may not be rewarding", "ESH.\n\nNatalie for obvious reasons. \n\nBut you - you are not the mother. Lucy is not your daughter. You have no right to call her your daughter. You aren\u2019t even her stepmother. \n\nThis child deserves a relationship with her actual mother, whether or not the mother deserves it with her. And you - someone with no claim to this child, who could be cut out of her life in an instant if your fianc\u00e9 broke up with you - took steps to prevent that from happening. \n\nStay in your lane. This is a family issue between Brandon and Natalie. This child is not your property to be hoarded.", "ESH I agree with you. The best thing for you to have added was that you'll see her in court.\n\nI might agree with Brandon if I knew his family had regular contact with Natalie.", "A little bit too direct perhaps. Personally I value a direct approach myself, but I don't appreciate anyone saying rude things to me.\n\nYour emotions are perfectly valid but why snap over an ex? They are in your past. Sure, they're part of your life because you have a child together, but why be mad at the past?\n\nThey helped give you a beautiful daugther didn't they? In theory, you loved them at some point. Do you not love who you were in your past when you chose them?", "That woman  is a parent.  That is she gave birth.  You are a mother.   Were there nicer ways  to  say it? Definitely  but my answer is, no you are not.", "NTA you were protecting your daughter. Next time call the police after you get her inside to establish a record of egg donor\u2019s erratic behavior.", "NTA. Sounds about right, too me. Nothing to see, here.", "NTA!!! When someone attacks your child, momma bear comes out!", "Get some good legal advice in your area. PLEASE be sure ya'll are doing everything you can to protect Lucy.", "Read it twice can\u2019t find anything wrong.When marry adopt her and have a beautiful life.

If it happens again, call the police so it is documented.  I know she is an addict but she has no right just showing up. Have her parental rights been terminated? It sounds like she has lost her rights but there is thing called a TPR. Also if Brandon had an attorney he should let them know this happened.  Let Lucy's therapist know too.  You are in effect the mother and I hope you get married right away.", "Nta sorry bio mom, the truth hurts \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, she wasn\u2019t invited. It\u2019s messed up that she tried to attend. How did she even know about it?", "NTA. As others have said, keep cussing and yelling away from any child as much as humanly possible. But keep protecting Lucy. Probably a good idea to discuss this incident in general with her therapy team to get some help on how to approach the Natalie issue with Lucy herself. Establish boundaries and rules in any setting that could put Lucy at risk (school, park, etc). If Natalie shows back up, remain calm(er), call the police as needed, try to defuse, keep Lucy in a separate area.", "Nta. Probably should document for future restraining orders. Good job being a mom. All the best", "NTA. Maybe you went a little further and said more than needed to be said, but for good reason. You were defending your family. Sure, there may have been gentler ways to respond, but you were provoked and said what you felt needs to be said.", "NTA,\n\nshe showed up uninvited at your house & made a scene; You owe her no politeness at this point.\n\nShe did WORSE than nothing for the kid", "NTA\n\nMARRY then ADOPT Miss Lucy", "Her daycare knows only Brandon and I can pick up on Mon-Thurs.

So, I would say that OP has no love for that woman.", "Yes they have been terminated.", "My mistake, there was a lot of wording and my ADHD admittedly had me briefly scan it. Not an excuse, I just tend to filter out negativity myself. Working on it. Why be angry at anything from the past though?\n\nIt's called an 'ex' for a reason. Why not be grateful they're not in your present? Or, at least not in your day-to-day.\nAs\nI imagine at most, you're spending maybe a few hours tops around these unpleasant people, so, distract yourself internally for a few hours rather than choose to get tense over people of the past.\n\nEnjoy your present people, enjoy Lucy and Brandon. Distract with Lucy and Brandon. \n\nAs far as details and safety go, my hope is that you're not using real names and ages. Especially for dear 'Lucy', a four year old can't generally defend themselves.", "If Brandon has sole PR can he also grant you PR? Could simplify things if the police are involved in future if the current status is neither of you are related to Lucy.", "Did you even read the post? OP isn't mad about an ex showing up. She's mad about an ex scaring the kid and throwing a tantrum, further hurting the kid. She's mad about an ex screaming and threatening to take the kid away. \n\nIf you're just going to skim and \"filter out negativity,\" then don't comment since you don't know/understand what is going on.", "No lol the names come from celebrities/fictional characters I like/don't like.\n\nLucy: James A.

Natalie brought a knife to a gun fight. FAFO", "I like a person who uses name switches myself. I've had plenty of aliases and nicknames my whole life. I also really enjoy creating nicknames for characters, with or without meaning.\n\nInteresting that you didn't address the rest of my post. Names certainly weren't the main focus of my own words.", "It was a matter of reassuring that I am not doxxing my family. I was only angry because she was acting up at a party for Brandon and she made it all about herself.", "Fair enough. Maybe set a boundary next time, and tell her she will have to leave if she keeps acting like a child.\n\nAnd then, stay true to your word and remove her from the premises.\n\nAs long as you present it in a firm and calm way, there should theoretically be no issue."]}
