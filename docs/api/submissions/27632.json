{"id": 27632, "submission_id": "16rzlkl", "title": "AITA for refusing to write my father\u2019s girlfriend a thank you note?", "selftext": "I\u2019m an only child. My parents, who are both senior citizens, have been divorced for the past 16 years. There\u2019s absolutely zero hope of reconciliation between them, but they *are* each other\u2019s best (and only) friends as they\u2019ve known each other for 46 years. He still meets with the both of us for breakfast once a week. She even pays his online bills for him because he\u2019s a complete and utter Luddite.\n\nFor the past ten years or more of this arrangement, my father has been involved with an odious woman we\u2019ll call Lauren. I\u2019ve never met Lauren - and I wouldn\u2019t like to. She believes very firmly that exes should have nothing whatsoever to do with each other, period, no exceptions. She once threw my father out of her home (where he was living at the time!) and incinerated his personal effects because a friend saw him at dinner with my mom and I to celebrate a special occasion.\n\nFor my father\u2019s part, he refuses to tell Lauren that his friendship with his ex-wife is non-negotiable, which is thoroughly unfair to her. He also demands that my mom and I remain silent if she calls him in our presence, and will even refuse to come out to celebrate my birthday at a restaurant for fear of Lauren finding out he was at the same table as my mom. This is thoroughly unfair to us.\n\nI have tried at various stages to tell my father that, while it\u2019s none of my business how he runs his personal life, this situation of lying to his girlfriend and expecting us to cover for him is unfair to every party involved.\n\nAlas, this is all always to no avail - and with this context, you can understand the current conundrum. My father recently had a birthday. In addition to our family breakfast, I meet my father for lunch once a week. Since Lauren knows this, she gave him a gift card for the two of us to eat at a \u201cfancy\u201d restaurant (The Cheesecake Factory). He is insisting that I write her a thank you note for being considerate and giving \u201cus\u201d this gift.\n\nThis is something I did once before, many years ago, to keep the peace. I\u2019m no longer interested in indulging this kind of double-standard behavior. I declined to write the thank you note. I\u2019ve been told (by him) that I\u2019m being rude and inconsiderate, and that it\u2019s the least I can do to show my appreciation for her generous and thoughtful gift. I feel strongly in my convictions that endorsing his behavior wrong, but I also feel like I\u2019m an ungrateful jerk who\u2019s disappointing his dad.\n\nEdit: For clarity. I did not use the gift card. I did not ask for the gift card. I do not have the gift card. My father has the gift card, and is insisting I write the thank you note whether or not we have used it, because \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d He is also insisting we use it for our next lunch meeting. I have very little control over whether he does or not.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1695665896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rzlkl/aita_for_refusing_to_write_my_fathers_girlfriend/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father's girlfriend, Lauren, has shown no consideration for your family's feelings and has even gone to extreme lengths to control your father's interactions with you and your mother. It's entirely reasonable for you to refuse to write a thank you note for a gift that is clearly a way for her to maintain control and manipulate the situation. Your stance against endorsing his behavior is valid, and you shouldn't have to compromise your principles to appease her unreasonable demands. Your father needs to address the issue with Lauren rather than putting the burden on you.", "You didn't even get the card.\n\nSo for what should you thank her?\n\nNTA", "I don't know if youre the asshole... what I do know, is there are so many levels of asshole before you refused that it's a negligible, if not non existent, amount of asshole behavior.\n\nFuck disappointing your dad. Your dad has let you down SO hard AND let this annoying woman down, by lying to her about his friendship with your mom and his refusal to admit being with you and she, especially for things like your birthday.\n\nTell him you'll write her a thank you when he stops being so dishonest.", "NTA - It wasn't a gift for you or to you.  Those are the only gifts that you write thank you's for.", "NTA but going by the time span you've given, you're also an adult. Your father apparently has no spine where this Lauren person is concerned, and neither you nor your mom have put your foot down. An extremely formal flowery note thanking her for graciously allowing you time with your father might do more to send a message than no note.", "NTA it\u2019s his gift he can write the note if it means that much to him", "NTA - the gift card was a gift for your dad and he chose to share it with you. \n\nAs such, if you\u2019re going to write anyone a thank you note for the dinner, it should be to your dad for the invitation, and HE can write Lauren to thank her for the gift.", "NTA. It\u2019s silly to thank someone for a gift that wasn\u2019t for you and you were never given. \n\nThough, if I were you, I would write a thank you note:\n\nLauren,\nThank you so much for the gift card you gave my dad. He didn\u2019t use it for our lunch on his birthday, perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the weekly breakfast we have with the two of us and my mom? It would be nice for her to benefit from it as well. Thank you again for the thoughtfulness.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't need a thank-you note for giving a gift. Don't write it.\n\nWhat your father is putting you through is unfair. I can understand her being annoyed by his close relationship with his ex-wife, but if it's a deal breaker, she needs to leave. Your dad was really wrong to miss your birthday because he was afraid of her, he also needs to make a choice : get away from his ex-wife or break up with Lauren. He can't keep hiding things and asking you to cover for him, it's unhealthy for everyone involved.\n\nDon't make that note. Only a narcissist can expect a written note from a child because she gave him a gift. That alone doesn't make me want to meet Lauren. Your father seems to give in to her every whim.", "NTA, and wouldn't a card from you trigger her into some kind of spiral of being reminded he's had a life before he met her? yeesh.", "You're NTA. She gave him a gift card. Even if he chose to buy your meal with it, he is still the receiver of the gift. For past decade, she wants to pretend you and your mother never existed. You owe her nothing but the same consideration she has given you.", "NTA do not write the note and anybody who is telling you to do so doesn't get how the world really works", "YTA. You\u2019re misplacing the anger and resentment you should feel for your father onto Lauren. Your father fucking sucks. You\u2019ve literally never met this woman, but your dad has scapegoated her so bad while asking you to help cover up his lies? How fucking embarrassing.", "ESH. Obviously your stepmom sucks for wanting your dad to completely cut off the mother of his children and your dad sucks for going along with the charade, but you gotta pick your battles. The thank you note is common courtesy for what is a pretty nice gift, albeit from a shit person. Turning it down is a dick move and does not help your case at all.", "YTA.  Don\u2019t take a gift from someone if you\u2019re not planning on saying thank you.  Saying \u201cthank you\u201d is what you do when you accept a gift.  Don\u2019t want to say thank you?  Don\u2019t accept the gift.", "ESH, other than your mom. The girlfriend has some inconsiderate demands, your dad at least on the surface goes along with it. And you were alright using a gift card specifically given for you and your dad to use, but draw the line at a thank you note?", "Meh, A thank you note takes 2 minutes. But, if you are so against it, you're a grownup and can decide for yourself. And the CG isn't for a Michelin starred restaurant or anything.\n\nTo paraphrase Yoda and Hamlet - Do, or not do.

To placate her, he returned to the same slandering campaign and incessant court dates to modify child support for almost two grown kids because she was coaching him to follow her playbook. (As if he paid any prior - learned that later on).\n\nI drew the line there because my entire childhood was defined by their constant dysfunction and they were finally showing signs of improvement until the GF imposed her opinion on it when her insecurities came to light.
