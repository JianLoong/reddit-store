If they want an extra spot they can pay for it like you do. It\u2019s common courtesy for them to ask you if it\u2019s okay.

If you only need one, either rent out the other, or ask for your lease to be adjusted to only pay for one space.  If you think you will need the parking space later, then just keep parking so that you block both.    \nIf you park to block both, I would alert management to that fact and explain that you are assigned both, only have one car at the moment due to an accident, but want to retain both parking spaces.", "NTA, they're your spots. \n\nYou're just petty LOL. You could've just told them you don't want them using your spot. \n\nBut you're not an asshole.", "NTA, of course.\n\nIf you don't need or want both, offer to rent it to them, otherwise keeping parking across both of them which is a great way of flipping them the bird.", "NTA. \n\nYou pay for them, they are YOUR spots. To save them for a guest (and keep you from having to move your car ) I\u2019d get a cone and write leased to 4-A or whatever unit on it and put it in the spot. I\u2019d also talk to management about the offending tenants", "NTA. Those are your assigned spots.", "NTA. They should have asked. If they had it would have been reasonable for you to offer them the space in exchange for them paying the rent on it. But they didn't choose that route. Your response is in line with their actions.", "NTA but it seems self-defeating because if you have guest over, you're going to have to go out and move your car. I assume you don't wish to rent the space to them.

I assume they pay less rent for 1 spot\n\nI feel like your best course of action would be to relinquish 1 spot in exchange for reduced rent if that's an option. If that isn't an option, then it seems odd that you're being so protective over something that has no value. If you dislike the neighbors for other reasons, then by all means, but otherwise this behavior is hoarding just for the sake of hoarding.\n\nOf course if you have plans to get a new vehicle, then once you actually need 2 spots again you'd be NTA for reclaiming what belongs to you.", "Well, yes, I can understand that.

And of course, as soon as OP needs the spot for any reason - including things like getting a new roommate - by all means reclaim the spot.\n\nThis is a capitalist society, so I stopped short of calling OP an AH for hoarding, but that is what is going on here. Whether or not hoarding wealth makes a person an AH is a debatable."]}
