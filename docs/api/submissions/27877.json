Even if you think they r over reacting just apologise and move on with life", "Eh. YTA dude. And I say this as a heterosexual married man.\n\nImagine if you said this to the woman in a heterosexual couple. You\u2019d basically be verbally emasculating the man, implying that he\u2019s somehow less than he should be and she\u2019s something that she doesn\u2019t intend to be. It\u2019s kind of similar, only They both see themselves as women. Your comment comes across as ignorant and insensitive of their lifestyle and relationship.", "YTA. They're both women - there aren't men in their relationship.", "YTA.  What an incredibly shitty thing to say.  Your \"joke\" was not funny and your sister called you out.  Frankly, your niece and her wife and your sister showed A LOT of grace by not calling you out right then and there, waiting until later to address the issue.  I don't think I would have been so well mannered.  If multiple people are calling you on your shit in life and on Reddit, then they probably aren't \"overreacting\".  Take the hint.", "I guess same sex couples hear this \"joke\" about who is the man and who is the woman for hundred times. This is so not funny. YTA", "YTA. It is not a joke if you are the only one finding it funny. Assuming that someone in a lesbian partnership is \"the man\" is absolutely insulting. Don't impose your \"traditional\" role understanding on other people, regardless the kind of relationship they are in. It is not lighthearted, it is not funny and you earned that reaction. You are lucky that they were polite about that - they would not have been overreacting if they chose to leave after your totally inappropiate jokes.", "YTA. It wasn't even a funny or particularly witty joke. I actually don't even 'get' it, so most likely it came across as just kind of snide and judgmental. What even is the point of remarking about which of them is 'the man'. It's ~~one thing~~ irrelevant if one of them conforms to more masculine traits or whatnot, and you KNOW they are a same-sex couple and that for them to get pregnant, it involved some process relating to a donor. It just strikes me as unfortunately insensitive and kind of like flimsy humor that didn't fit into the setting.\n\nSame-sex couples encounter contempt all the time around the expectation of traditional gender roles, where other people insist one of them must be the man and one must be the woman, so their reactions are in part based on how tired that whole thing is. As a supportive, loving uncle, you can do better.\n\nEDIT: Clarifying language", "YTA you hurt your niece and your reaction is to double down?", "YTA - what were you thinking???  Or were you thinking???  Did you ever think that  your niece might not be able to have children???\n\nYou are so much the AH there isn't a way to accurately measure it.", "YTA. There are no man on a lesbian relationship and there are not woman on a gay relationship. You are homophobic, and you are trying to cover it up with the excuse that it was just a joke.", "Assuming that every relationship has to have a man is seriously homophobic. YTA", "YTA. It's not a joke when no one laughs", "YTA. Apparently you have a problem with them not needing a man in their relationship (apart from a sperm donor). Also, there are plenty of masculine-looking heterosexual pregnant women, so your joke falls flat either way. First thing would have been to congratulate them on the pregnancy.", "YTA. Are you really that socially inept? Or do you think they owe you forced laughter when you mock their major life events?", "YTA.  Instead of congratulating them and appreciating being included in such a big family moment\u2026you let ugly stereotypes ruin the moment and relationship with your niece.  They are not overreacting.    Neither of them are men anyway!  Just what the hell was your point in saying that at all?  You made an assumption and made yourself an ass!", "YTA  There was absolutely no reason for you to say something like that.  You did not make a joke, you made a snide mean spirited comment.  You were way out of line and insulting.  You owe your neice and her wife an apology.  Grow up and start acting like a decent adult.", "YTA  \n\n\nand homophobic there is no man in the relationship there are 2 women  its not a lighthearted joke its being abusive.", "I think you get it by this point mate, but YTA", "Yes, YTA. There *is* no man in the relationship. That's the whole point.", "NTA in my opinion. Don't see anything wrong with the joke. But everybody has different humor.", "YTA. You were deeply insulting and homophobic. They are not overreacting, in fact I admire their restraint.", "YTA. Making that joke was bad enough, but the fact that you didn't apologize afterwards and instead just dropped it and then made excuses via text makes it even worse. AND that even now you're continuing to insist that her niece's partner is the \"man.\" You haven't, and apparently refuse, to learn.\n\nNot every relationship needs to be put into cishet terms. There is no \"man\" in the relationship, they're both women. Apologize, and stop trying to translate a queer relationship into a het context.", "YTA. You are disgustingly homophobic. \n\nIf two lesbians are in a committed and loving relationship, why the fuck do you think you have the right to call anyone a 'man' in their relationship? Why a man? \n\nThey are not rude. You are. And you certainly do not know what a joke is. \n\nA joke is something at which people laugh together.
