Long story short we moved to my home country and have been living here, he went back to his home country for a couple weeks and I kept urging him to book the flight back in time for my birthday. He kept saying he\u2019ll do it and eventually he did book one but for the day before my birthday. He went to the airport and was emailed saying the flight was delayed (not cancelled) TWICE, he was emailed the same thing twice with the correct information. He said he got there and there was no one at the desk and the board said cancelled so instead of asking a member of staff since the email said something different to the board he just shrugged his shoulders and said \u201coh well, guess it\u2019s cancelled\u201d, while he\u2019s there I\u2019m telling him I\u2019m looking up the flight number and what he\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t seem correct because I\u2019m seeing it was DELAYED not cancelled. He said the multiple emails he received must have been an error and this one board says it was cancelled so it must be cancelled. \n\nFast forward a few hours I open a chat with support and they inform me that the flight was in fact not cancelled, just delayed, and they would\u2019ve emailed passengers with the updated information, which they did. My husband has a habit of thinking he knows things he doesn\u2019t and assuming things, so despite receiving the confirmation of the delay twice he said he assumed it was a mistake and somehow they were wrong on their end, without even talking to anyone he just assumed the emails must be wrong. \n\nMy birthday arrives midnight on the dot and multiple friends, family etc are wishing me happy birthday and he does too, a few hours later at like 2am I check his flight status and it says departed, so I call and wake him up and let him know he missed it only for him to say he thought the emails were wrong and it\u2019s just a mistake. At this point I\u2019m livid and I tell him stuff like this really wears me down and makes me feel like I can\u2019t rely on him to not assume he knows better than everyone else especially when he has no qualifications to think so and just messes up any expectations I have of him actually pulling through. He eventually says I\u2019m being mean to him and he didn\u2019t do it on purpose so I say I\u2019ll just find another shoulder to cry on. Now I\u2019m sat here alone on my birthday after declining friends and family\u2019s offers to go out because I expected my husband to be here. I really don\u2019t think I can get over this and if I do I\u2019ll just ignore his next few birthdays. \n\nI just feel like he messes up big time and then just says \u201csorry\u201d and expects all to be forgiven. \n\nAITA for wanting to disregard his next few birthdays because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to put effort into his big day when he couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask someone something before leaving the airport, going home and going to bed.\n\n*EDIT\n\nI think what has me most frustrated is his arrogance and his everything must be wrong except the one thing I saw to confirm it\u2019s cancelled. The multiple emails, the online flight confirmation and tracker, it must all be wrong because I saw the board say cancelled.

So in a way, you two seem to deserve each other.\n\nSeeing as you don't want to take advice that has been given multiple times, here's a crazy idea: in stead of complaining about a situation you obviously expected to happen, why didn't you just go with and celebrate your birthday abroad?", "ESH. Two wrongs don't make a right. And it went from \"birthday this year\" to \"next few birthdays\". If you guys can't move forward from this, what kind of future is there really? He goofed and missed your birthday, so now you retaliate? I agree he handled the flight situation poorly, and if behavior like that is a trend it needs to be addressed. But I can't think of any couples counselor would would recommend ignoring birthdays as an appropriate way of addressing it.", "ESH because of how the question is phrased, NTA otherwise. If you didn't actively sabotage but also didn't go out of your way next time around, that'd be logical, and if he asked why you didn't put in more effort you could cite this experience. But in general tit for tat shit just perpetuates and gets worse. It sounds like you clearly explained the issue, so what makes sense as your next move is to wait for the apology. Have another conversation. Lay out expectations. Etc. But planning to fuck up future events on purpose is immature and unhelpful. I feel you, his arrogance in this situation was ridiculous and caused issues and stress that didn't need to exist. But \"stooping to his level\" isn't the answer. It never is", "both of you need to do some maturing.", "ESH\n\nYou two need to have a proper, mature conversation about this and resolve the issue. \n\nHe needs to sincerely apologise, make up to you, and be better.\nIt's completely understandable why you are mad, sad, and more due to his behaviour.\n\nHowever, intentionally disregarding multiple of his birthdays would be very hurtful and intentionally hurting a loved one is never a good idea. It would become very difficult to fix things and can cause resentment from both of you.", "YTA. \n\nHe's a bit dumb clearly, but you ignoring his *next few birthdays* would be straight up spiteful and childish. \n\nAn eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. But it wouldn't even be an eye for an eye, because nothing in your post even hints that hes done this deliberately. You ignoring multiple birthdays, however, is 100% deliberate.\n\nYour feelings have been hurt and you're lashing out at someone you're meant to love, instead of talking it out like an adult.

Do you even know if he went to the airport in the first place? \n\nHard to judge this one as it would be ok for you to dial back on his birthday this year, but then you go and escalate.", "ESH.

Just change your plan and call your friends and ask them if they are available for a last minute birthday dinner/party.\n\nSo many people choose to celebrate their bday on weekends so that everyone's free.

The whole payback/hurt your partner back thing is a recipe for having a horrible relationship. If you want to make your partner unhappy, even in the name of fairness, you should just end the relationship. Otherwise before you know it you're in one of those terrible boomer cartoon relationships where the husband and wife are always looking for ways to take little jabs at each other or convince others that they're in the right. \nThis is not to say you shouldn't address his behavior pattern. It sounds exhausting to have to always be managing your partner. It's ok to tell him honestly that this pattern is not working for you and he needs to figure out how to step it up. This is not one single conversation, this is an ongoing process. If he refuses to take you seriously the next step is to figure out how much of a deal breaker all of this is for you and act on that, not to be petty and skip his birthday.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re with him. He knew the flight was only delayed, but he didn\u2019t want to come to you to began with - so he used the cancelled card as his excuse. Why are you with someone that treats you like that?

Don\u2019t waste your time with this one.", "YTA. you knew he was like this when you married him. he is an idiot not evil. he wasn't trying to hurt you he is just stupid. if you do this you will actively be trying to hurt him for revenge. you might as well file for divorce now if you do that. no marriage should involve intentionally hurting the spouse.", "YTA. You need to mature emotionally.", "YTA I think you need to grow up.\n\nProblems with delayed flights happen, it's stressful, it's confusing, and it seems like you were just focused on the fact that he's gonna miss your birthday the entire time. It's fine to express that you're disappointed, but seems like he did apologize, and now you're gonna hold this against him? And ignore his birthdays? Immature.", "YTA. That\u2019s petty revenge. It\u2019s horribly unhealthy in a relationship to treat everything transactionally. He apologized. The board said cancelled. That means it\u2019s cancelled. Not \u201ccancelled to depart at that time\u201d. They instead would have the word \u201cdelayed\u201d on the board. Either way, you\u2019re now trying to use his birthday for revenge and to teach him a lesson. That\u2019s not how a healthy relationship works", "Do both of you a favor and divorce him already. \n\nIf this is how you guys treat each other year 1, I can't imagine all the petty fights you'll pull over the years.", "There is a bigger problem.  He didn't want to come and used that cancelled as an excuse.  Don't be petty, be defiant and get a divorce because this kind of gaslighting will never get better, only worse.  He isn't going to be there when you want/need him because he doesn't want to be there.", "YTA. He made a foolish error, but it would be childish and petty to hold it over him. \n\nEveryone loves having a day where they\u2019re celebrated, but you\u2019re an adult now. It\u2019s time to realize that celebrating late or on a smaller scale is not a big deal. You are acting like a spoiled brat.", "YTA\n\nI can't possibly imagine a situation where I would intentionally ignore or sabotage years of my wife's life for a mistake, no matter how big. Marriage is about take and give and sometimes you just gotta be willing to move on and celebrate together later. Be mature, act like the adult you are and either let it go or get a divorce and let him be with someone who treats him right.", "ESH. If I got to an airport and it said my flight was cancellend it would probably be my first reaction to believe it. Should he have double checked? Probably. Especially these days with how messed up airlines and airports are. But your expectation for him to be there solely for your birthday is kind of ridiculous, too. You're an adult. Why couldn't you celebrate it another day? Honestly it sounds a bit spoiled.", "YTA \n\nDisregarding MULTIPLE birthdays over a stupid mistake is just mean. Yeah he didn't explore all his options, but idk if the board said \"cancelled\" I would think many people would be like \"mkay it's cancelled.\" \n\nHe didn't do anything malicious, but you want to.", "ESH", "**Major YTA.** \n\nYou really need to put things into perspective here. You are making a HUGE issue out of an unfortunate event. Yes, he probably didn't make the best decisions possible, but airline travel can be complicated at times. \n\nIf you are making a big issue out of this tiny problem then you are going to shit bricks when real problems pop up later in life.", "YTA: You say an apology isn\u2019t enough. What do you want? Him to get on his hands and knees, grovel. He made a mistake, a stupid one, not out of malice. The answer is you accept and move on, or you decide you don\u2019t like it and leave. You don\u2019t maliciously start planning revenge to punish the other person and get pleasure out of potentially causing them misery. This isn\u2019t a point scoring exercise. He did this so I\u2019m doing this. Mature. What a vindictive nasty person you are and you seem to think this is normal and keep doubling down to defend your nastiness. Woah be me.", "So he makes a genuine mistake, a significant one but still a mistake, and your immediate response is to plan to throw a multi year long tantrum? That's not how adult relationships work.\n\nESH but you more than him.", "ESH. It really seems like he didn't try hard to be home on your birthday. However I agree that you planning petty revenge sucks as well. It sounds like you expected him to travel at 2 AM just to be home on your birthday? That kind of sucks as well. Your birthday is just a day and you could celebrate it another time. It really sounds like maybe he wanted more time at home or maybe he just didn't like the idea of flying all night just to be home on your birthday. Perhaps he should have been more honest but you make it sound like you were nagging him and making way too big a deal about being home on your actual birthday.", "YTA\n\n\nHow old are you? Quit throwing your little tantrum and grow up.\n\n\n\nNo wonder he didn't seem to be in a huge rush to get home.  Flying is stressful enough but then he has to deal with a flight that's either delayed or cancelled while you screech at him because he might miss the obvious biggest event of the year: your birthday.", "NTA\n\nBirthdays are clearly important and he knows that. You asked him multiple times to book a flight back in time for  yours and he decided to drag his feet before booking it last minute and he does it for the day before your bday. Once he allegedly sees cancelled on the bored, he immediately gives up any plans of flying and goes back to where he's been staying.\n\nDoesn't sound like he cared to be there for real and made no effort to get the proper information. He got out of it the first chance he could \n\nSkipping his next few bdays is a bit childish but sometimes you honestly have to give people the same energy they give you. People give you little to no effort while expecting leaps and bounds for you", "This kind of man is a literal danger to himself and everyone around him. It\u2019s all fine when it\u2019s just a flight but what happens when you have kids and one of them is sick and \u201che knows better\u201d, there will come a point where you need to make a decision and his arrogance and ignorance (the most dangerous combo) will cause irreparable damage.\n\nPeople who are like this - cannot admit fault, always know better, never consider other possibilities - the way they think, it comes at a cost to everyone around them. \n\nNTA but you will be if you stick around for this bullshit.", "NTA. But why\u2026why are you with this man? He\u2019s arrogant, lazy, dismissive of you, and obviously doesn\u2019t give a shit. Don\u2019t ignore his next birthday\u2026dump him and ignore them all.", "NTA, but I think it's time for you to accept the communications you are being given instead of trying to turn them into something else. A common phrase for what I mean is that you need to 'drop the rope' -- right now the two of you have a dynamic where you request he shows up for your birthday, he doesn't want to and fakes some effort to hide that,  you react to the fake effort by trying to drag real effort out of him, and it's never going to end because all this nonsense is keeping you too busy to think about whether you really should be living like this.\n\nGuess what, you shouldn't be.", "NTA for being upset. You are the AH for the things that you said. \n\nfor some reason, it is generally acceptable for a wife to talk like this to her husband if she is disappointed. There are no circumstances in which it would be acceptable for a husband to speak like that to his wife. I don't believe in furthering gender norms.

The flight being delayed isn\u2019t the issue, he can\u2019t control that, but he can control asking for clarification from a member of staff when he has two conflicting pieces of information.", "This is what I feel like! I\u2019m not sentimental or caring or celebratory in general but I know that it\u2019s what he needs on his special days so I go out of my way to make it happen, no matter what. I go out of my emotional comfort zone and make sure he feels loved and celebrated on days we deem important especially birthdays since we both had bad birthdays growing up. \n\nSo to book last minute bothered me and then to just give up without asking anyone a question when you had multiple emails feels like he didn\u2019t or put in the effort.", "This is what I asked him, if I\u2019m making our baby will he just say \u201cthe hospital board said you weren\u2019t here\u201d and go home? He won\u2019t bother to ask a question?? Call someone?? Just I saw 1 thing and didn\u2019t care to ask\n\nI can\u2019t stand his arrogance especially with things he doesn\u2019t know about, he\u2019s never worked at the airport to have more knowledge than the average person so it would\u2019ve served him well to asked but he assumed the multiple emails the airline sent him were just flat out wrong, I asked him who is he to deem the airline wrong when they send multiple confirmation emails.", "I didn\u2019t request he did. He promised he would be here. Maybe he really just didn\u2019t want to come", "Thank you for the advice, I appreciate it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to punish him and I need to look into that internally and see why I want to do that but generally I\u2019m not an outwardly caring person due to my upbringing so on special days like his birthday I have to put in a real effort to make him feel loved and celebrated and I kinda just wanted the same but I feel like he didn\u2019t even double check before leaving so my mind goes to \u2018why am I stepping out of my emotional comfort zone to make his birthday perfect when he can\u2019t even be bothered to go to the desk and confirm the two conflicting pieces of information he has\u2019", "INFO: are you sure he bought tickets? \n\nDid he give you a fight number before he said it was cancelled? \n\n**I may be way off base** but it sounds like he didn\u2019t want to come home, and his behavior is suspicious, like really weird. That everything came up as cancelled for *him* and no one was around for all those people on that delayed flight\u2026", "NTA.   skip his next birthday", "ty for replying! i really didn't think the negative responses you have been getting were fair. your feelings are extreeemely valid and personally yeah i'd just not go out of my way to do anything particularly special and, if asked why, give an honest response. you're 100% correct that this arrogant/careless combo will cause more issues for him and others even outside of this specific situation and he should want to work on that. good luck! and happy belated, hope you had a nice time with everyone else at least", "For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say you are right. Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to come home- it\u2019s still an ESH situation. \n\nEither way, if you continue to hold grudges against your partner to punish them, it shows a lack of maturity and will not bode well for the health of your marriage.", "If he said it said \u201ccancelled\u201d then why would it have said delayed? Those are two different things. If you think he purposefully ditched you for your birthday, you have bigger issues that won\u2019t be solved by you choosing to go down this dumb revenge path", "Why should you be bothered? It's called \"love\". He made a big mistake. He apologized. We aren't all in elementary school when who had the biggest party is the coolest kid in homeroom. You knew he was like this when you married him and you still chose to get married to him, knowing how he was. It's a birthday. One birthday.\n\nThis year my birthday consisted of my wife saying happy bday at midnight and not nagging me when I ate 3 cupcakes in a row. Not every birthday has to be an all out occasion", "if the board says the flight number and time and canceled, you assume its canceled.", "Everyone tells you your plan is a problem. \n\nYou: it\u2019s not a problem. \n\nThis marriage isn\u2019t lasting.", "Yes. It is.\n\nHanlon's razor would be beneficial to your world view. What he did wasn't malicious. What you're planning is.", "Yeah I understand this was important to you but it really seems like it wasn\u2019t that important to him. The while thing is a bit ofd because for a 2 week trip why didn\u2019t he just book a round trip ticket?  So yeah he kinda sucks for that and you deserve to be upset. I am making an assumption but it seems like maybe he wanted to spend more time at home. \n\nHowever, I would just talk to him about it and let him know how you feel. You can still enjoy his next birthday. Give him a chance to make it up to you and plan something special to celebrate your birthday even if it is later.", "He was in a lose lose situation here... even IF he made the flight, he would have gotten home and to bed AFTER 6am.  His tiredness would have ruined your birthday anyways, and youd be here asking the same question but under a different premise.\n\nYTA, especially for brooding all night until 2AM just so you can call him and let him know that he was wrong.", "You're in your 20's supposedly and planning to throw a multi-year tantrum because your husband missed a flight that was delayed or cancelled.  I don't believe that there wasn't any hysterics going on at the time.\n\n\n\nHe was visiting his home country.  It doesn't make sense to book a flight home days early for your birthday on the off chance the flight gets cancelled or delayed.", "That\u2019s fair and valid. My original interpretation was that you were going to change existing plans for his birthday to get back at him. What you\u2019re describing sounds more like you are emotionally spent and considering dialing back future celebrations of him to match the effort he puts in for you. \n\nIn light of that, I think you\u2019re NTA but that you need to do some soul-searching about your relationship. If your partner makes you feel unappreciated or unimportant, is that really who you want to live your life with? Not saying you need to part ways, but I would encourage an honest conversation with your spouse about their actions and how they have made you feel. You deserve to feel special and be celebrated.", "It goes out of your emotional comfort zone to want to celebrate his birthday? You really do need to do some introspection", "100% sure. The frequent flyer miles were used and got the confirmation email, I had the flight number as well, that\u2019s how I was able to tell him I\u2019m checking online and it just says delayed.", "Thank you, I think I worded my intial post oddly so people think I\u2019m being malicious when I\u2019m just hurt. The saddest part is I declined everyone else\u2019s invitation to go out because for both our birthdays we plan to spend the entire day together and I planned to spend it with him, so everyone else planned otherwise and I\u2019m just home alone.", "It really just feels like I got fucked over and I just have to deal with it. He said \u201csorry\u201d and unless I accept it and just let it go even though this is pretty significant for me then I\u2019m a bad person somehow.", "That\u2019s exactly what I thought! The email said verbatim \u201cwe wish to advise you of a change in your flight time\u201d it does not say cancelled! So I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about seeing it in on the board when no other piece of correspondence said that.", "I don\u2019t care about a big party, that wasn\u2019t our plan. Our plan was to spend it together and I specifically booked myself out of work and declined other celebration requests to spend it with him. Before and so far during our marriage he hasn\u2019t been like this, so I didn\u2019t \u201cknow he was like this before I married him and still chose to marry him anyway\u201d.", "You\u2019re right it\u2019s not because one half isn\u2019t willing to pull their weight and come through for important milestones. God forbid I do the same to him then it\u2019s a problem but he did this to me and unless I just forgive and move on it\u2019s not lasting? Once again, if what he did was okay then why would it be a problem if I did it? Unless it\u2019s actually not okay", "He didn\u2019t book a round trip because he would be coming back before my birthday for sure but no set date really if that makes sense. I tried talking to him about it but he\u2019s adamant that he thought all of the airlines emails were wrong even though he has 0 liberty to think that is making me consider doing nothing for his birthday.", "Even if he had gotten here and just slept I wouldn\u2019t mind. At least he would\u2019ve been here. \n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t brooding all night, he said his flight was moved to 6am even though I told him I\u2019m not seeing that anywhere or in any email, I couldn\u2019t sleep so he went to sleep as he\u2019d been up all day and I was gonna wake him up for 6am to be on the next flight. I wasn\u2019t brooding I was being considerate. While I was up I decided to check again and noticed the mistake he made and that\u2019s why I woke him.", "It does make sense to book early as we both fly frequently and understand it\u2019s better to have time in between when you need to be there to account for any delays or cancellations. He booked the day before flight so any delay or cancellations would have him screwed.", "Ohhhh, that may be the confusion everyone is having. There aren\u2019t existing plans for his birthday I\u2019m cancelling, I\u2019m just planning on not putting in what I usually do because of what he did. \n\nI appreciate your perspective and advice a lot, thank you", "No, it goes out of my emotional comfort zone and emotional rearing to plan dates, plan activities, plan gifts etc because it\u2019s never something I had or saw growing up or in any relationship before. So I make a high effort to research and do it right because it\u2019s what he wants, not what I\u2019m used to.", "Ok. That\u2019s good at least. I get why you are feeling this angry, I think you need to sit him down and tell him that you felt completely forgotten and that he made no effort for your birthday and see what his response is and go from there. \n\nAnd if it\u2019s not a satisfactory response for you, rethink the total package of this relationship-where he misses something important, puts no effort into things that are important for you, and thinks he\u2019s right, and won\u2019t double check even when he\u2019s massively wrong. \n\nAnd see if you can handle all that for the next 5,10,20 or 50 years and make a decision from there. \n\nNTA for your feelings. YTA if you do it instead of talking about it.", "I myself understand how you feel, I do. But you've been told by a few people that you considering to hold grudges and planning on disregarding his birthday for a few years as a punishment/revenge is really immature on your part and will not do anything good in the long run. And you disregarding this when people point this out, is telling A LOT about you. \nI am going to tell you now. Holding grudges and making acts of revenge does not belong into a healthy relationship.", "You do have to deal with it. The flight has taken off and he wasn\u2019t on it. That\u2019s the situation. So yes, you have to deal with it. He apologized. He literally can\u2019t do more than that right now. You can refuse to accept the apology and end the relationship or you can move on.  But there is no healthy relationship that allows grudges to be held for years, months even. Hopefully he learned something from this but honestly, I have seen wel seasoned travelers make seemingly dumb mistakes while traveling. An airport board, in most cases, will be the most accurate info and there is a difference between cancelled and delayed. If the flight still exists it will not say cancelled anywhere intentionally. It was likely a mistake at the airport and if no one was nearby to ask I can understand why he took that status over an email. How either one of you couldn\u2019t have called the airline to confirm though while you were \u2018begging him to ask someone\u2019 and tracking the flight is beyond me. \n\nIf this is your hill to die on, I guess get comfortable but this, to me, is petty. The entire first paragraph makes it sound like you wanted him to fly home well in advance to avoid a delay situation so you were likely already on edge about the flight he chose but your request to him was to be home for your birthday which that flight was. It\u2019s a birthday. Can you not celebrate tomorrow?", "Do you think your husband even went to the airport? The complete lack of effort on his part to check with anyone seems suspect if he actually intended to try to make it to you for your birthday", "You said he had a habit of doing this, which means this isn't the first time and you're still with him. Take it from someone older, this doesn't matter. It's one day. Celebrate when he gets home. If you love him, enjoy it when he does come back. He made a mistake and apologized. You have two options... Act like an adult and move on or act like a toddler and be petty about it. \n\nThe saying is about an eye for an eye but here he took an eye and you want an eye and a foot and an arm and the other hand....", "Because he was an ignorant dumbass. \n\nYou are calculating and manipulatively planning to be a jerk. \n\nThere are better ways to deal with this shit than tit for tat revenge. You know, like communicating. Or say, I\u2019m planning to dial down stuff this year. Not just throw them under the bus for petty glee whilst whining over and over about it. You sound like the sort of person who is going to make his life miserable by bringing it up whenever you can, and if you make it that far, \u2018joking\u2019 to your kids how deadbeat their dad is because of this one time.", "Okay... but you still called him when there was nothing he could do about the mistake just to rub it in his face... Look I understand you are disappointed, and he didnt show up for you when you wanted him to.  But, in this situation, YTA.  He could have been a better husband, you guys need to talk this out and move on instead of carrying this and getting revenge every year for several years.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, thank you", "It\u2019s not even a punishment or revenge. Growing up I didn\u2019t have great birthdays even in my late teen/early 20\u2019s. and neither did he, so when birthdays come around I have to make a concerted effort to make sure it\u2019s extra special, I feel like he saw one thing saying cancelled and just went home and went to bed. Like where was his concerted effort that would\u2019ve confirmed oh no the flights just delayed. I didn\u2019t get that effort so why should I put it in for his birthday? All I\u2019m asking for is some effort and not just go home instead of confirming the two pieces of conflicting information he had.", "I would\u2019ve loved to celebrate another time as the day itself isn\u2019t particular to me but I have a business and for the next couple weeks I\u2019m up to my neck in work and classes I\u2019m teaching. So it was literally either today or next month and I planned well in advance to accommodate us having the time together. Now I\u2019m sitting home alone doing nothing, not making any money when I could\u2019ve worked and taken maybe tomorrow or the weekend off.", "I didn\u2019t call the airline, I hopped on a chat with them and they said the flight is still on, I told him this and he still left. That\u2019s what has me pulling my hair out, EVERYTHING is telling him it\u2019s just delayed, me, the emails, the online tracker, everything. He saw the board, ONE THING, and said well everything and everyone else must be wrong and just went home.", "Honestly I KNOW he did, I got the flight delay emails, the Uber confirmations(we basically use one account for everything) and we FaceTimed while he was there. So I know did. \n\nI feel like this situation is a case of him thinking he knows better than everyone else and assuming the multiple airline emails were wrong and it\u2019s landed him here.", "A habit of thinking he knows better than everyone else. Not a habit of being unreliable. \n\nI think it\u2019s fair for me to put in the same effort he did for my birthday, for his.", "OP is dead set on having her point validated here. She has a dangerously toxic way of handling her relationship and only makes it more apparent the more she responds to comments. Not even sure the point of posting except to have people agree that she should be spiteful. Eek", "No, I didn\u2019t in fact call him to rub it in, I called him so he could rebook another flight as he had missed this one and the chat said he needed to go to the counter to rebook. \nWhy would I call him to rub it in, who does that?", "If you plan on ignoring his birthdays for a few years over one mistake. Yes. It does sound like a punishment/revenge. A very childish and petty one at that. What you two need to do is to talk this out like mature adults. And not you plan on hurting him with malice for a few years over one mistake.", "Again though, the ship has sailed so to speak. So you accept his apology or you don\u2019t but if you don\u2019t accept it it\u2019s going to make for a very uncomfortable relationship if you choose to remain in it. Sure you don\u2019t have to put in effort for his birthday, but will that even matter to him? And is being petty really something that makes you feel better? He made a mistake, it happened to be on your birthday. How you handle it is up to you, but short of the entirety of Reddit telling he is wrong, what is your hoped for outcome here?", "You should look into couples counseling rather than trying to go tit for tat on his birthday. Hear me out. Counseling is meant to build a stronger relationship. Disregarding his birthday is only to show him how he hurt you. While satisfying, it won\u2019t help your relationship overall", "Then why did you ever ask us if you weren't going to listen to a word that MULTIPLE people have told you....\n\nLong lasting, healthy, loving relationships don't have room for this petty nonsense.", "I\u2019m not trying to be \u201ctoxic\u201d however I am extremely upset that my husband booked a last minute flight for an occasion that happens every year and he promised to be present for. If due to him being negligent to confirm the information he had makes him miss it and all I get is a \u201csorry\u201d then why should I put in a concerted effort for his birthday?", "Apparently you do?  There was no reason to call him at 2AM.  Nothing would have changed if you didnt call him... He would have woken up, and rebooked a flight.  \n\nLook, talk this over with a therapist, I gave my judgement and you arent helping your case.", "I don\u2019t plan on ignoring it, but I\u2019ll be putting the same amount of effort he put in for mine.", "I\u2019ll take this into consideration. I think I\u2019m just extremely hurt right now because we usually aren\u2019t like this and it\u2019s really shocked me. Thank you so much", "You keep saying all you get is a sorry and it\u2019s not enough but leave out what you want him to do. He can\u2019t change what happened, he can\u2019t turn back time. Neither of those things can be apart of the apology. What is it you want from him?", "Your upset is very obvious but you\u2019re not really interested in taking anyone\u2019s advice here. Many people have said the same thing to you and you just repeat the same information. That says to me your seeking validation.\n\nPersonally if my husband treated me the way you plan to treat your husband over what I would call an accident I wouldn\u2019t stay with him. It sounds exhausting to me\n\nUltimately you are going to do whatever you think is best for your relationship. If you think withholding birthday celebrations is the way, go for it. I would celebrate because I love my husband despite prior shortcomings.\n\nGood luck", "He\u2019s supposed to check in at 3am, I checked at 2am to make sure the flight wasn\u2019t delayed again only to see it was airborne, so I called him a panic to say I think you missed it and the lady on the chat says you need to rebook it. I wish I could attach a picture of the chat because i screenshotted it and sent it to him. I was literally in disbelief and was just thinking of him rebooking another flight. Not to rub anything in.", "Okay? It's still petty and childish. You're an adult. Act like one and talk it out with him. If you can't do that, and you think punishing someone over one mistake for a few years is the right way to correct anything, you're mistaken. It will just put a huge wedge between you two. If this is how you think relationships work. I am sorry to disappoint.", "Exactly. You are hurt. So don\u2019t go nuclear. Work on how to build from this rather than try to make him feel the hurt", "I wanted him to be a reliable adult and to book in advance with considerations for possible delays and maybe contact someone if it says delayed in one place and cancelled in another. Now that I\u2019ve sat here alone all day due to him not showing there\u2019s nothing I want from him. I can\u2019t accept an apology for a preventable situation", "So you are refusing because he shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place. That\u2019s not what an apology is. An apology by definition is given because someone fucked up. That\u2019s why they are given. He wasn\u2019t a reliable adult, fucked up and apologised. And now you are punishing him because you are expecting the impossible. Accepting an apology isn\u2019t giving in to behaviour. If he had been abusive, that\u2019s different, he just seems unaware. \n\nYour next steps are \n\nA. Accept the apology. Hope that he has taken on board your upset and makes more of an effort in the future. Talk about it. Put it behind you. If he doesn\u2019t listen and repeats. you definitely have a case to be more upset. \n\nOr B. Expect him to become a time lord and be a completely different person in a situation that passed. Hold a grudge and take revenge and come up with no solutions on how to make this better other than how can I make this worse. \n\nImagine you genuinely and without malice fucked up, apologised and he spent all the time trying to make your feel even worse over it. You\u2019d probably think he was being an AH. \n\nAs for sitting all alone and getting yourself wound up about it. Don\u2019t. Go and do something else. Find something you enjoy. He is not solely responsible for your happiness. Does it hurt, yes and fair do\u2019s. But you have personal accountability for how you deal with it. Get up. Decide to put this out your mind for a bit. Get some food. Stick on a film. Go out. Right now the only one choosing to continue your misery is yourself.", "NTA and honestly it sounds like he had absolutely no intention of going to see you.  He is clearly showing you that he doesn't care about you.", "NTA. \n\nPeople are focusing on you saying \u201chis next few birthdays\u201d and calling you an AH for that, when that\u2019s clearly not the point. \n\nThe point is, you are hurt that you put more effort into getting him home for your birthday than he did, and in the end it was all wasted effort anyway. Not only that, but you don\u2019t have time to celebrate on another day. So it was important to you, you clearly communicated the importance of it to him, and he just\u2026bungled it. \n\nThe point is, he\u2019s being dismissive and acting like a sorry fixes everything. Has he even told you happy birthday? Has he expressed any remorse that it\u2019s a day you wanted him with you, and no matter who\u2019s at fault, the fact is he isn\u2019t there with you? Has he expressed ANY sympathy at all, or is he expecting you to handle that emotional load for him as well as the mental load you\u2019ve been carrying?\n\nYou ARE NOT the AH for feeling let down, hurt, disappointed, betrayed, or like you\u2019re putting in more than you\u2019re receiving. \n\nObviously your hurt is making you say you don\u2019t want to do anything for him for several years. Obviously that\u2019s not set in stone, either.\n\nI\u2019m sorry he let you down, OP.", "Petty...but ultimately his utter incompetence is worse.

Nobody is that stupid he missed it on purpose", "THANK YOU! I think I said \u201cnext few\u201d out of frustration when I really mean this year as I stated in the title. He is being extremely dismissive and all I get is a \u201csorry\u201d and when I state that he should\u2019ve asked someone something he says I\u2019m being mean to him so it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even have the option to state my upset. \n\nAdditionally like you said I booked the time off since before the last month and a half so I ensured none of my clients booked on this day, causing me to have 7-8 fully packed days starting tomorrow so there\u2019s no time to celebrate my birthday within the month it\u2019s in because of this and I was asked weeks ago by friends and family to go out and I declined and my husband was supposed to be here so I\u2019m legit stuck with NOTHING to do, it\u2019s a small country in the Caribbean on a damn Tuesday.", "This is what it feels like to me and it pisses me off because he\u2019s VERY smart, not bumbling or an idiot in any way shape or form so to just not check any other resources or contact anyone was intentional.

So understand that without apologizing and accepting situations where you will both screw up, it will be chaos.\n\nAlso, accepting an apology doesn\u2019t mean you forget the hurt.

He\u2019s not some blustering idiot so this undersight is annoying me", "I wasn't saying this was the case for you, just arguing that there are people that find celebrating birthdays emotionally taxing and that doesn't mean there's something wrong with them nor that they need to do any introspection for it.", "So then go nuclear bomb on his birthdays as you are intending.\n\nHe may have screwed up (including not checking 18 gazillion different ways that you would expect him to), but if you can\u2019t see what people are saying in the comments you are helpless. Not being mean here, just know where you are at and seeing the path of destruction in front of you. My husband made many mistakes when it came to my birthday and Anniversaries. I also know the hard work I had to do to accept my spouse for who he is and how he doesn\u2019t meet my initial expectations. The communication pattern we set to ensure we were properly addressing the hurt and pain, not just going nuclear. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband long enough to know that we all screw up (and yes this was a major one). How you decide to handle it and communicate it with them is the path you will take towards a long and healthy marriage or divorce.", "actually this is like a combination of stupid and arrogant.  stupid does not necessarily mean dumb, i also use it the sense of poor judgement.  \n\nwhy would he do this to you when he knew what was going on?  does he just not want to spend time with you or maybe he didnt want to leave his mom? i think something else is going on here.", "Ohhhh I was confused bc you responded to my comment. I get it, and I agree 100%", "1. It\u2019s not \u201cchecking 18 gazillions ways\u201d that I would expect. It\u2019s asking the person at the damn desk \u201cHey, the board says cancelled but this email I just got says delayed, what exactly is the flight status\u201d I know it\u2019s possible because I hopped on a chat with support with that exact sentence and they confirmed it was indeed just delayed and he refused to ask anyone at the desk. \n\n2. I rather be divorced than be with a spouse like yours, if as you say, keeps messing up birthdays and anniversaries (important milestones and celebratory occasions)\n\nAll I was asking was for consideration and for him to not say f this at the smallest thing. I\u2019m not sorry for not accepting his apology and giving him what he gave me.", "The fact that you can\u2019t read and are so stubborn in your ways shows me you are not mature enough to realize that this will happen again. If not birthdays, it will be other things that he won\u2019t do well. As will you by the way, you aren\u2019t perfect. \n\nSure birthdays and anniversaries are important, but having a true partner in life makes up for messed up milestones. My day to day happiness is so much more important than making a whole spectacle out of the day I was born (and it is super important to me on top of that). The way he treats me every day can make up for any failed attempts at milestones. \n\nGo nuclear, get that divorce since that\u2019s where you are heading. Might not be today, but will eventually come if you can\u2019t accept an apology. But don\u2019t come crying that he screwed up your mariage if you aren\u2019t willing to work through a hurdle. There are such bigger mountains in your future. And while this may seem like Mount Everest today, it\u2019s like an ant hill to me after 23 years with a caring husband.\n\nGood luck OP!", "OP, I understand exactly how you are feeling. I think what he did was super shitty, and it would feel shitty to see that your partner couldn't be assed to check a board or book another flight. He went home and went to bed? Wtf? When my partner and I were LD for a time, he moved heaven and earth when there were flight problems. He booked another flight, another airline, spent a longer layover, etc. It's NOT the making the mistake like all these YTA votes are saying, it's the lack of desire to even try, to even ask one question. That does hurt. A lot. I would also feel like it showed how much he cared. And it seems he has a pattern of blustering and doubling down when he's wrong. That is horrible to live with.\n\nThat. Being. Said. \n\nWhat on earth do you hope to accomplish with this plan? Years of an unfulfilling marriage with someone you respect less and less each day, and whom you've now given cause not to respect or care about you even more? Wow. That sounds horrible to me. You still have SO much life ahead of you. I say this in the kindest way possible:\n\nDecide how important this is to you. Make it very clear, once he's slept and you've had time to cool. Listen to him if he is giving a reason for simply shrugging and going home. Weigh it. If you can't see yourself accepting that answer for all of these situations for all of the years to come... Then really, you know what to do. If his excuse is reasonable and you can live with it, be clear about how this hurt you. But if you accept the apology you must move on. Offer counseling or something if you still want to save this. But don't set yourself up for a life of just hating each other, that sounds miserable. \n\nI wish you the best.", "Once again I don\u2019t care if he messes up! Mistakes happen, but the effort is what counts and he put in exactly 0 in this instance. So you\u2019re right, to ME this is Mount Everest today. And it\u2019s not fair to diminish is because you\u2019re used to tolerating mess ups for important days with YOUR husband. I\u2019d rather be divorced than settle for someone who doesn\u2019t care to make the effort to right when it counts the most", "NTA. I would be \"away\" on his special day. No Fs given. But Ima petty princess.... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f", "ESH\n\nYou're crying over a birthday, which, no matter when it occurred, can be celebrated any day.\n\nHe's an asshole and you married him anyway.", "Info: has he left you and you don\u2019t realize it yet?", "Honestly that\u2019s what it\u2019s looking like for me", "It can be celebrated any day to YOU, but we made and had set plans for it to be celebrated today, on my birthday when we planned it and I took time off from work and set aside my day. And this is the first time this happened so to say I \u201cmarried him anyway\u201d like I should\u2019ve seen this coming when it hasn\u2019t happened before is nasty.", "This is why I\u2019m feeling you\u2019re strictly NTA. The fact that he did not follow up with the flight information makes me feel like he didn\u2019t even go to the airport. I don\u2019t know why but it does seem like he didn\u2019t want to come home yet. However knowing the effort you guys both put into each others birthdays it seems very inconsiderate of him to 1. Cut it so close in the first place when booking his flight home and 2. Not confirming the he conflicting information knowing how much these days mean to the both of you. Especially since you declined other plans it just screams self centered, irk. It makes me feel like he\u2019s so wrapped up in himself and his wants and needs that he didn\u2019t even think about how this would make you feel on your birthday: abandoned, lonely and any other feelings I\u2019m sure you went through during this ordeal.", "I will add on though that you should definitely communicate how this made you feel and have a discussion on how special days like birthdays and special dates be handled in the future. I\u2019d probably be honest and say I\u2019m probably not going to go out of my way to make your next birthday a big special thing. I assume you would still of course acknowledge and wish him a happy birthday and if he still finds a way to celebrate you which I hope he does just match the energy and effort. But if you\u2019re feeling like the energy and effort isn\u2019t want you need to feel loved and appreciated then different conversations need to happen.", "I agree", "YTA & very controlling & juvenile but your husband is at fault too.", "So form all the world problem u can make u decide to make one about a birthday !\nTake a shower and a  long sleep  \nWhen u wake up rethink all of this put a paper and write all the point why  u are angry \nThen what's the solution for each one of them \nIf u can't find a thing that make that point be forgotten / forgiven seek therapy \nAt the end speak to ur husband about all the points and the solution u want and what he thinks of them \nHave an open conversation u can agree on disagree \nBut seeking revenge u need therapy if u think it's the only option / solution on the table \nUr feelings are valid ur response to them ain't \nESH", "It sounds like you guys fight a lot and he might have done it on purpose.  That would be the bigger issue.", "Why are you two married???\nYou might want to rethink that arrangement. \nIf you want to remain married, then celebrate his birthday and quit being petty.\nBut do have a serious talk about expectations", "ESH. Hey girl, all your comments on this topic and this post itself clearly show that you already know what you want to do, so I'm not sure why you posted this on an AITA thread instead of, well, any other relationship subreddit. So let's summarize this:\n\n* **You don't forgive your husband and you're not willing to forgive him no matter what he says or does to try and rectify this situation;**\n* **You feel deeply hurt, disregarded, unloved and ignored by your husband;**\n* **You feel like you put much more effort into him than he ever puts effort into you.**\n\nYou're obviously unsatisfied with this relationship, it isn't the first time he does this, you resent him and don't want to be around him anymore, and I don't understand why you're arguing with other redditors about this instead of clearly stating what you already know you want to do: **You want to divorce him.**\n\nSo do yourself a favor, please, and try to talk about this with him and tell him that if he doesn't change considerably, you're going to divorce him. That's all you can do in this situation. Step up.", "If this was just about the flight, I'd be saying Y T A. I can easily see someone making that mistake since so many flights are cancelled these days. But it sounds like you're frustrated because of long-standing annoyance with your husband's arrogance.\n\nIt doesn't even sound as though you like him much.\n\nIf you don't...why are you with him? ESH", "ESH. You both sound extremely immature imho.", "Controlling how?", "Yes, him not showing up to a planned birthday engagement that was set months ago is a problem. It just happens to be my birthday but had it been any other planned and prepared for situation I would be just as upset.", "I don\u2019t feel unloved or ignored or disregarded. This particular situation shocked me because he\u2019s never behaved this way before. I don\u2019t want to divorce my husband where did you get that from?", "So talk about it not seek revenge \nWe have a saying in my country ( U decide the volume of ur problem u want it to be big it's bigger u want it to be small it's smaller )", "You are a stubborn one, aren't you? By all means ignore his birthday, that won't change that what you're ignoring isn't his birthday at all. You're ignoring the glaring problems in your relationship instead of properly, maturely, sensitively addressing them and setting out your expectations. \n\nAgain, I ask you: Why did you post this on AITA? What do you want to hear?", "    I don\u2019t want to divorce my husband where did you get that from?\n\n*\"I\u2019d rather be divorced than settle for someone who doesn\u2019t care to make the effort to right when it counts the most\"*", "I\u2019m not stubborn, you\u2019re telling me what you think I\u2019m feel and I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t feel those things. I in no way feel unloved, annoyed by this situation YES but not unloved. I also never said or alluded to wanting a divorce so for you to say that is baseless. I\u2019m also satisfied in our relationship once again this one situation has bothered me. I haven\u2019t mentioned any other part of our relationship for you to draw these conclusions from.", "Yes because the other person commented and said they accept that from their husband and forgive him each time. I responded by saying I rather be divorced than have to forgive someone multiple times year after year for the same thing. That is in no way me saying I want to divorce my husband because if this one instance. Are you seriously okay?", "The way you talk about your husband, what you intend to do to him because of this conflict AND the way you answer to the other redditors is enough for me to guess that you don't seem to be a very pleasant partner to be around... \n\nI wouldn't want to be married to someone who behaves like you, petty, confrontational and immature and apparently with 0 communication skills since you're posting this on reddit instead of talking to your husband about it like a normal person... \n\nBut that's just me, isn't it? Best regards to you and your husband, I guess...", "Oh, I'm definitely okay, this is just very amusing in general. I wonder what you intend to do about this?", "Okay, I\u2019m going to disengage from this conversation with you since you seem to have not understood my initial post, have a good one and be safe <3", "I\u2019m gonna disengage with you right here, it seems you may have misunderstood my post and pulled issues from it that aren\u2019t there. Have a good one and be safe <3", "Best of luck on your marriage, girl, I think you'll need it.", "Then by all means, divorce him. He's not meeting your expectations and you're not willing to communicate or forgive. It's only gonna be misery for the two of you."]}
