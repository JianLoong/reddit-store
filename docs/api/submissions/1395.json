Your arrangement shouldn't be conditional on whether you feel like you've been asked nicely. Either you are or aren't helping each other. \n\nAt the same time, shared funds should mean you are clear about budget so everyone knows what they can and can't do.", "NTA the person getting the piercing pays for gas. If they thought otherwise then they are the AH.", "Edit- NTA with updated info. This was never a part of your agreement and your gf should've asked. Info - Did you talk about if this is for school/needed expenses only or also personal expenses? What was your agreement?", "NTA. She who wants piercing should be buying the gas. Probably lunch too. That's a big ask on her part to use you both for 164 mile round trip. She pays before gf goes with a full tank. You get to stay home and do whatever you like.", "NTA", "NTA. Her friend getting a piercing is most definitely not part of your agreed upon arrangement.", "NTA the friend should be covering the gas for the frivolous driving expense not you. It's different than covering her expenses to go back and forth to school.", "NTA and maybe you need to renegotiate that \"deal\" you made to basic needs only.", "Wow you're doing so much already and the gas is a problem? Something doesn't sound right.\n\nBased on the explanation, NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  You have an agreement what you will pay for.  Hopefully, she has some money besides what you contribute for extras.", "NTA. The friend should be paying for the gas, and lunch.  Unless you\u2019re her sugar daddy, then you both need to act like adults and have boundaries and discussions.  Unfortunately, since this sounds like a hair brained plan of a teenager, there\u2019s probably a serious maturity gap in this relationship.  It sounds like you\u2019ve stepped into a parental role, replacing her parents. That\u2019s a very dangerous thing and can delay her growing up.", "No they just said it was happening", "So she goes to school about 41 miles away, and drives that daily, which I knew thay going into the arrangement, so that\u2019s not an issue, however wanting to take her friend/classmate 41 miles past our house so like 82ish miles, because that\u2019s where my partner\u2019s piercer is. So she wants to do like an extra 164 miles, and make me pay for the gas.", "No it\u2019s not too much at all, it\u2019s the concept of not being asked as established for luxury/non-necessity type things. Had my partner asked I wouldn\u2019t be upset and say I\u2019m not doing it", "The arrangement was I would pay her bills and gas money to and from school.", "My partner offered to take her friend.", "The agreement was I would pay her bills and gas money to and from school. The trip is so her friend can get a piercing", "I can kinda explain better, I got lucky and I work a job making 75k a year, she was working 40* hours a week and going to school full time, and we barely got to see each other, I\u2019m talking 2-5 hours a week, on a good day. So I sat down and said, hey I would like to spend more time with you, so if you\u2019ll let me I can take over your bills, and support you through school so you won\u2019t have to work, I won\u2019t mind you spending the money on luxury items as long as you ask if it\u2019s okay, not to control what she buys, just because I was taught that in a partnership when it comes to non necessities to ask before buying, I Have no problem with paying for extras, if the respect is given and asked prior. I make enough money, it\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s her thinking she can do whatever she wants with it now.", "No, I haven\u2019t stepped into a parental role, I literally want no control over anyone, I want everything someone does to be purely genuine", "Then NTA", "So she has to ask you if she wants to grab a coffee or a movie or shopping with said friend?", "Seems like a super controlling dynamic. \n\nDo you not have the money? Maybe she misses this friend, maybe she needs to get out. Maybe a bunch of things. It sounds like you don't know or haven't asked. \n\nIf you're responsible you'll both have a conversation. Something like, \"Hey, I thought we'd agreed on X, but Y is happening and honestly I'm just a bit confused. I don't know if I have the funds to do this sort of thing regularly, and I want us both to get through school. Is the current arrangement OK for you or should we discuss changing things up, because I want you to live your life but I also want to keep our goals in mind.\" \n\nIt sounds like a very problematic thing to agree to in the first place honestly.", "Then gas is between them. Their deal their gas. Edit saw your update still NTA. They need to figure out the gas money. Not a necessity.", "Ok thank you my friend, I understand now. However, I still say you're NTA. \n\nI think it's great what you're doing and you seem to be a real man but it's kinda being ungrateful on her part. Now to be clear, I don't know how your relationship works so you decide for yourself. That's just my opinion", "She came home and said \u201chey I\u2019m taking friend/classmate (who she sees everyday for 8 hours) to a town 82ish miles away and then taking her back home\u201d the whole reason I even thought of this arrangement was because with her going to school full time and working full time we maybe saw each for a handful of hours a day, and we barley texted or talked when we weren\u2019t together. There is no me wanting control here I want everything she does to be genuine and not because I influenced it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to pay extra for her leisure.", "Did you ask her more questions? Did you discuss your budget? \n\nIt sounds like what you agreed on was \"I'll look after you, because I and your schooling are your whole life.\" That isn't fair. You wanted to see her more so she should quit her job? Give up her independence? I'm sorry, that's controlling. \n\nIf you genuinely care, encourage her to get a job so she can do this sort of thing without breaching your boundaries but so she can still have leisure time. If you're worried she might start burning a hole in your pocket with activities that don't involve you and treating you like her sugar daddy, explain the agreement and that you DO want her to have a life, but you don't know how to manage it fairly and, again, encourage her to go back to get a job.", "No to all of what you said he's already doing more than he should be doing. She needs to get a JOB and stop being a moocher", "If he told her to quit her job and is now like \"Sorry I'm your life\", AH. \n\nIf you committed to supporting someone, support the full someone. \n\nBut I agree, she should have a job and independence.", "No, I didn\u2019t make her quit her job, I gave her the opportunity to keep her job and support her self. She is very independent", "She can't support herself without her job. So if you are genuine, tell her you've realised this. You can't provide everything she deserves and shouldn't have the final say over whether money is spent on gas so she can see her friends or pizza to share or whatever. You respect that. So for the sake of your relationship, and her own independence, she should re-enter the workforce. \n\nI assume you don't want her feeling beholden to you any more than you want to feel used."]}
