So I didn't know her before hand\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've been living together for about 6 months and overall it's good. We're both clean and we pay rent on time. Nobody is annoying or loud in the night. Our only major difference is I prefer homemade food while basically everything she eats is frozen or from a package. She's one of those people that eats nothing but junk food but doesn't put on any weight. She doesn't eat homemade and won't even try it. I struggled with my weight growing up. I'm in good shape now but I eat in reasonable portions and pretty much cook everything. My roommate seems appalled by the idea of homemade food. If I am in the mood for pizza I will make tomato sauce, get flour and yeast, make the dough and put it in the oven myself. I can pretty much make yeast in sauce and bake a pizza in the time it would take to have one delivered anyway so it's convenient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe don't share groceries but I don't mind letting her use my stuff. She barely eats what I have anyway so it's not a problem. I don't mind if she bums some milk or uses some of my cheese or whatever. However, because she eats out or buys packaged foods, she tends to run out of money. So near the end of each month she eats less and will check through my stuff for things she can eat. Sometimes she gets pissed because I don't have \"normal\" food. I made myself a big pizza and offered her some but she said she didn't want it. She would rather a pizza from a restaurant or a frozen pizza. She saw me eating ramen one day and asked if she could have some. I told her she could but it isn't package ramen. I buy plain bulk ramen noodles and made broth myself for it. She seemed upset at that and generally anything not packaged or from a restaurant disgusts her. She reminds me of friends I have that order chicken tenders and mac and cheese from fancy restaurants. I've made no remarks against her for this. I don't really care, she can eat how she wants to. She's been going through her money earlier than usual lately and seems to be lashing out on me. She's asked why I never just have chips or microwave macaroni. I explained how I don't eat that way because of previous weight issues. She said that I should keep her in mind when I get groceries and that people that live together share. I told her that she would be extremely pissed if she bought hot pockets and I ate a couple of them so this \"sharing\" thing would be one sided. She didn't say anything but she's still pissed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make homemade brownies and lightly salted popcorn at home. She asked if the brownie I was eating was from the store and was upset when she learned it wasn't. When she snaps at me I say things like \"it's not my fault you eat like a 3rd grader.\"", "created_utc": 1682863055, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133sg3d/aita_for_not_buying_groceries_and_snacks_my/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's the full extent of what any reasonable person could hope for.
