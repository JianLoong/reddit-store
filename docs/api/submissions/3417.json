I have coarser curly hair that can really only be brushed on wash days when it\u2019s wet, otherwise if I brush it dry it\u2019s a poofball. I wanted a new one so I bought one. \n\nWe ended up back at my house and she took her hair out of her bun at some point and asked to use a hair brush. I said sure and retrieved one of my many brushes from my bathroom and quickly picked out some of my old hair and handed it to her. Sam then clarified that she wanted to use my new one I just bought, not a \u201cdirty\u201d brush. I kinda laughed and was like \u201cthat\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to use an old one\u201d and took it back and went to sit down. Sam was then staring at me so I asked \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d And she asked if I forgot to grab the new brush or something. I then told her that I didn\u2019t want to share that one since it was brand new and I bought it to use on my wash days. \n\nShe kind of scoffed at that a sarcastically said \u201cit\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to get it dirty, I wash my hair everyday\u201d so I just explained that I didn\u2019t want to share it right now but I had lots of combs and brushes she was free to use. Sam called me childish for not sharing and said she wouldn\u2019t want to use my used hair tools because they\u2019re probably greasy and dirty since i \u201cbarely\u201d wash my hair. At this point I was kind of pissed off because she knows that I wash may hair every 1-2 weeks due to its texture. It never looks greasy or unruly, I spend an ungodly amount of time styling and caring for my hair.  \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be an AH, I pointed out that Sam\u2019s hair was oily already at her scalp, so she shouldn\u2019t be be judging me for my wash schedule. She got all huffy and said I didn\u2019t need to be mean over a stupid hairbrush. I then told her I was done hanging out and I\u2019d see her later. \n\nSo? Did I take it too far? Personally I thought implying my hair was dirty because I don\u2019t wash it everyday was rude so I was reflecting the same energy to her.

I can't share even a plastic comb with my daughter.  We have dramatically different hair, and the residue from her products are too much for my hair.  Even rinsing a comb, it's still there. \n\nYour friend was wrong for how she worded it, and wrong for expecting you to allow her to use your new brush.  She should have kept her hair in her bun. She wasn't wrong for not wanting to use your used brush, but what an entitled attitude she has!!", "Is any hair type okay to shampoo everyday? Anyhow, NTA. Hair brush/comb sharing? Gross.", "NTA I don't lend brushes regardless. She should carry one in her purse. She is a choosy beggar.", "Nta. 1 she sounds as if she looks down on you. Seems as if she puts you down. Does that happen a lot? 2 i never let anyone except for my kids use my brush. I grew up in a place where lice spread constantly so i dont like sharing my brush for that and also cuz ew", "NTA she clearly doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s being racist AF. As someone whose hair gets nasty after two days no wash I can relate to the initial shock, but it honestly sounds like she wants you to feel ashamed?", "NTA. Shes doing the exact thing she accused you of. Being childish. It's not her possession and I'm typically against sharing hair brushes with Anyone anyway. \n\nShe can buy her own brush if she's so hot and heavy to use a wet brush.", "NTA. so she can get your brush dirty but she can't use your dirty brush?", "NTA. Kinda weird to me to be sharing brushes unless they are heavily cleaned/sanitized between uses. And even then...", "I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t even think of this in terms of sanitation. \ud83d\ude33 but that makes sense, anything people touch can have germs and things left behind on it. So, I suppose Sam is right that my used brushes are dirty, but also She\u2019d be leaving microbes behind for me making the new one dirty, so \ud83d\ude02", "We\u2019ve definitely had a conversation before where Sam was absolutely shocked when I told her I only wash my hair as needed every other week or so. She has very fine and straight hair and I guess washes everyday because of it \ud83e\udd37 said something along the line of \u201cI could never skip washing my hair it would get so greasy!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t think that knowing my wash schedule would make her think that my hair was dirty\u2026 to me this is normal", "RIght, that\u2019s why I just cut off hanging out for the afternoon.

I probably just shouldn\u2019t share hair stuff at all.", "Absolutely floored that lice removal technician is a job. I guess there are people who need help with it but I really just never thought about it, my mom's a hair stylist and always just slapped some mayo on us.", "exactly. I almost was going to joke you both are AHs if you share, Glad you are now aware!!!", "It's normal for me, too. People who don't have curly hair don't get that our hair is very dry, or why we have to use products to maintain it. The first time I told someone that I don't use shampoo (I cowash), the look I got was enough to never say it to anyone again. My hair is very clean and never gets greasy. I get compliments on how good it smells, lol. I only brush it when wet and full of conditioner.", "It took me years to undo the damage to my hair because I never had anyone tell me how to manage curly hair. A neighbor took pity on me one day-she was a saint!  I have dry hair and live in the desert. I could go weeks without my hair getting greasy (I do not go weeks, but I could lol). I really wish people understood their experience is not universal. You\u2019re NTA and she\u2019s rude.", "Just FYI I also have course curly hair and if you find it's getting frizzy/knotted between washes you can wet it a bit and brush it with a wet brush just in case it's useful. I tend to give it a wet brush every couple of nights or it turns into a tangled mess but that's my hair yours will be different. It's whatever works best for you and your hair, just in case it was useful."]}
