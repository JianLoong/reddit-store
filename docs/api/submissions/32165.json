Three boys who are now in their 20s and my daughter is 18. Their father and I divorced 6 years ago after learning he was cheating on me with the woman who was supposed to be my best friend. He got her pregnant which is why the affair was discovered. I hated them both from that moment on. Two months after I filed for divorce they lost their baby. But they stayed together and got married and had a daughter 3 years ago. My former friend died a year after her daughter was born after complications with her heart condition.\n\n18 months ago then ex abandoned his kids and nobody has seen him since. My son asked me if I would consider taking his half sister in and I told him that would never ever happen. He asked for me to help him to raise her and I said I would have no part in raising her. I acknowledged she was innocent but I told him I could not look at her without seeing what her parents did to me. None of my other children wanted to help either. My son decided he would still take responsibility for her. He dropped out of college and quit his part time job to work full time. Two months after taking her he and his siblings started to argue a lot because he wanted their help babysitting and he wanted them to know her but they refused. He asked for my help with babysitting on multiple occasions. I gave him some money to pay for a babysitter on a few occasions but told him I would not babysit.\n\nGetting to present day, the relationship between my middle son and the rest of my kids is at an all time low. He's ashamed of them and they do not want a relationship with their half sister. He feels we all owe her a family.\n\nNow he has decided he is going to try and trick me into caring about his half sister and be willing to do more. I learned through my daughter that he has talked about if he could move home and have me help with her or take over raising her (his half sister) it would be better for everyone.  He told us all he wants to host Christmas for the family this year and his siblings all said no. He begged me to come and said he really wants us to all be a family again. I told him I love him and I always will, but I have a very firm boundary around not being part of his half sister's life. So I will not show up to their home on Christmas. I also will not raise or help him raise her. I told him I heard about his grand plan and he needs to figure out an alternative because it will not happen.\n\nMy son told me I should try to be better than her parents. I should show everyone what an awesome mom I am and not only stand by him and help him with this, but give a little girl a mother who doesn't have one. He tried to say it would really annoy her mom if she were alive to know her little girl loved and knew me as her mom. I stood my ground on my no. He then told me I'm not being a good mom or a good person and if I don't agree then I'm the worst person in this whole equation.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701518817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1892e4r/aita_for_making_it_clear_to_my_son_that_i_will/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I cannot do the same or give him the support to make sure she has a good life. I know that would be the most loving thing to do.

You told him from the beginning that you would not be helping. Your boundary is reasonable in light of the adultery and the fact that yoir son is expecting you to give up 15 years of your life to raise another child. I would tell him this: I am almost done raising your sister. Im not interested in raising kids until I retire or drop dead.", "NTA", "ESH but your son, who seems like an amazing human.\n\nThe lack of compassion with you, your ex husband, and literally all of your other children is somewhere between sad and haunting. I get your boundary, you don't want to raise her don't raise her, but the loathing and judgement of your son who is, frankly speaking, the only person here showing any degree of moral worth paints you with tar and your other children not giving a damn bring the feathers.", "Well I'd say your feelings towards your ex and your ex friend are valid. \n\nHowever this is a kid who is blood related to your own children who you are quite happy to have punted off to foster care from a comment you made in reply to another person. \n\nLook I fully agree with you that you are NOT the person to take charge of this child.  There is no way you could hide your dislike from this child and you would end up emotionally abusing her because of who her mother and father are . Psychologically for this child's own sake you should be banned from being near them. You are a hurt adult who seems happy to hurt your own child because of your ex so I can imagine what you would say to the child of your ex's affair with your best friend.  Isn't there anyone else who you could reach out to in your ex's family to look after her? \n\nYour son is an amazing young man giving up so much to raise his half sister.  Your other children have taken after you and are demonizing a child because of who their parents are.  \n\nI fully expect that in a few years time you will be wondering why your son went no contact with you and his siblings.", "NTA - I would say your other children could be considered ah since the little girl is their half sister but you are not in any way related or responsible for her. Your son should not be trying to manipulate you with his bullshit reasoning.", "NTA, decisions were made right and left around you , ex husband and ex friend decided to cheat on you and have an affair they decided to stay together and have a baby . The ex husband decided to disappear and leave behind a toddler. Your son decided to step up and take care of his half sibling .\n\nNo one cared to include you in their decisions or even consider how they are going to impact you . The only right thing to do is to look after your own well being .\n\nI\u2019m not sure if your son made any attempt to contact the kid\u2019s mother\u2019s extended family for help or support but he should if he didn\u2019t already . But you should let him know that although it\u2019s a very unfortunate situation that he is in but he also needs to consider your position and the fact that he can\u2019t expect that your life will continue to be the collateral damage to your ex\u2019s life decisions.", "You should be proud of your son for taking the responsibility on raising his sister. You\u2019re other kids should be ashamed of themselves as should you. A little help here and there won\u2019t hurt you or them. What will happen if you\u2019re son decides he can\u2019t do it anymore and the child ends up in foster care- that is a sh!t show. If she is unlucky its not care she will receive, it\u2019s wont even be tolerance but more often then not it\u2019s abuse. The child has done nothing wrong, but be born to two sh!tty people.

Men guilting women into taking care of someone else yet again. Your adult son decided this, your ex decided on having a baby, then he decided to abandon all of his children even an infant\u2026but noooooo lets get the ex wife involved and make her responsible for this mess the men created. Instead of enforcing this on you OP did your son try this: search for the dad and make him responsible by the courtsystem, get other familymembers involved (family of the half sisters mother)?\nIn what freaking world is OP responsible for her ex\u2019s child. She probably has her own things going on and she is in her 50\u2019s. Why would you guys think this is good for OP? I dont like the guiltytripping your son is doing OP. He didnt think this through and he cant just dump the baby on other familymembers since it was his own idea.", "ESH - your son is wrong for trying to manipulate you into taking care of a child that you have no responsibility over. However, the child is innocent in all this. You\u2019re cutting your son out of your life because he stepped up when no one else would, and I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d forgive you for that anytime soon. And imagine how this child will resent you and the rest of your family when she grows up, just because of how you feel about her parents.\nAll that being said, does the mother of the child have parents that are still in the picture? One would think the child should have gone to them instead of to the half brother, or to another family member. If he needs help he should also contact that side of her family.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s great your middle son wants to take on the responsibility to care for his half sister since he is indeed related to her. But for you, you have no relation with her except that she is your ex\u2019s kid and your children\u2019s half sibling. You do not own your ex\u2019s kid any responsibility nor do you need to prove to anyone your character.\n\nIf your middle son wants someone to show their character or they are a good parent, then he should instead be hunting down your ex to do that. Or better yet, find the grandparents and aunt to do it. Not someone who is not directly related like you. \n\nYour middle son is probably regretting taking her in as he\u2019s aware the whole thing is out of his ability, hence, he\u2019s trying to find ways to offload her to someone else, especially one who has experience which is you. If anyone else other than ex needs to step up and do better, then it\u2019s him.", "Nta. Your son is old enough to know actions have consequences. You are right in setting up boundaries. He is trying to manipulate you don't give in.", "NTA.  Even though your son seems to be trying to do something good it seems like his long term plan is to demolish your very reasonable boundary.  In your shoes I would work very hard to find your cheating ex father of that baby.", "NTA. File a police report on the father. I commend your son for stepping up for his innocent half sister. While you have ZERO obligation to the child and it's 100% understandable on how you feel, your other children should be ashamed of themselves for shunning a half sister who did absolutely nothing wrong. They are mad at her for simply being born?!?", "So many AH here and only a sane one trying to give a life to a child.\n\nOf course you're not \"required\" by the laws of the land or the moral of the universe to do anything. But you could, and you just don't want to.", "NTA. You have no obligation to your ex's kid. Your son, on his own will, took in his half sister, he was not forced to do so.\n\nI understand why he is upset, and I'm sure he's overwhelmed, but that doesn't make it your responsibility.", "YTA. I'm not even entering in the should family help each other or not which imo already puts you all into ahole territory. But the fact that you are all seemingly excluding him and the daughter is horrendous. \n\nI'm assuming he can't bring his half-sister to Christmas since you all refuse to interact with her and he has offered to host. And that's deplorable, turning your back to your family just because he is adopting an innocent kid.", "Tell him if he needs help reach out to dad and his family", "ESH\n\nYour son conspiring to make you the main caregiver is obviously AH behaviour, and you\u2019re not obligated to do that. You\u2019re not obligated to this child at all. But if everyone lived their life by obligations and nothing else, nobody would have any friends. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to babysit all the time (which is fair) - refusing to even be in the same room as that innocent little girl for Christmas is beyond petty and rude.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of unresolved issues stemming from the awful betrayal of your ex-husband and ex-friend. May be worth looking into some sort of counselling or therapy.", "NTA.  People have this idea that it is wrong to blame the kid for existing, and it is, but that doesn't mean you need to be a parent to her.  It is not your fault how she came to be, and you are not to be held responsible for your ex's asshole behavior, or your best friend's.", "ESH your son is looking after his own blood relative. An innocent 3yo who has no other family this is how family should behave. You don't have to have a parental or grandparental relationship with the child and your son should respect your boundaries and not push for it. However alienating your son and allowing your other children to alienate their brother and half sister is a really crappy way to behave as a parent. I think you all need some therapy before the 3yo becomes screwed up by this terrible family dynamic", "YTA.\n\nThe little girl did nothing wrong. She is blood of your blood, and yet you'd have been fine with her being sent to the foster system...absolutely bonkers.\n\nEven if you don't like her and want nothing to do with her, don't you care about your son? Because the rest of your kids are following *your* example. If you, as their mother, would take the high road and support your son protecting / caring for his younger sibling, the rest would probably ease up too.\n\nNot many your son's age would have the compassion to care for another like he's trying to do. He wants to give the little girl a family and you are essentially punishing him for it.", "NTA, however, your son now basically has a daughter. I'm proud of him for being such a caring person, he's young and raising a child on his own. It's hard for me to put into words how much he must love this little girl", "YTA. Not for not helping, but for how much you hate this child and would rather cut off your own relationship with your son rather than even be NEAR her. It\u2019s not her fault her parents were shitty. Your son has a massive heart, and wants to keep his family together. He doesn\u2019t want this little girl to go to foster care. He wants her to be loved, and has uprooted his entire life for his sister. Directly or indirectly, your extra firm stance on this is causing distance not just between you and him, but him and his other siblings. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to take care of the kid, but you can\u2019t even tolerate to see her for Christmas? Jesus Christ.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand these people saying otherwise, it\u2019s not on you to raise a child you didn\u2019t help create.

Why he wants to make you a mother to his half sister when he knows you would resent that? Poor girl would have a parent that does not love her? He thinks that is a healthy relationship? \n\nNTA.\n\nHe is brave for wanting to raise her, but toxic by trying to still throw the poor girl like a bag to another person in the end. Adoption can be a better option in certain situations.", "YTA, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve made any effort to be his mother at all. You\u2019re not obligated to take another child in that isn\u2019t yours but you\u2019ve clearly created a hostile environment for the child with their step siblings, the child is innocent.

He doesn't give up.", "YTA.  A whole lot of this is understandable.  But refusing to see your son for Christmas because you don\u2019t want to see his sister is taking it too far.  I get why you don\u2019t care about this child, but the way you are punishing your son for caring about his sister and not wanting and innocent child to suffer is taking it too far.", "YTA.\n\nBut not for the reasons you think. I get the premise that every time you see that child, you're just going to think about the betrayal of your ex. Not wanting anything to do with the child is reasonable. \n\nThat said, you're about to allow your son, in his 20s, destroy the path of his life in order to become a single parent without a support system. This makes you a shitty mother. I get the trauma from the ending of a marriage. But you're 50 years old. You'd think you had the wisdom needed to see what's about to happen to your son. You're going to lose that son. \n\nIt's best you get comfortable saying, \"I have 3 kids\" from now on.", "You\u2019re a very cold hearted person.

The thing is, it\u2019s not necessarily about the baby, it\u2019s about your son. He\u2019s stepping up to do something noble and he needs help, as his mom you should want to help him. It\u2019s basically his child now not the ex\u2019s.\n\nEither way if I were him I wouldn\u2019t want anyone in this family taking care of her, this poor baby is being hated and shunned by a bunch of grown adults. Hopefully the baby\u2019s family on her other side will step up and help your son or he finds a loving partner who will be willing to love the baby.", "NTA, you have zero obligation to step up for the girl.

Thankfully for this little girl, at least her brother is a good human with an heart!", "NAH - your son is being very sweet and generous taking on his half sister, but you are under no obligation to take care of not only a child that is not yours, but a child who reminds you of betrayal. You would however be quite the saint if you did help out a little, but again are under no obligation to. You're right that this little girl had nothing to do with what her parents did, so you would be setting quite the example if you did help out, even if it's just a little. This could also help repair the relationship with your son and other children. It's a sticky situation and I'm sure a heart wrenching one for you. I hope you figure out what works best.", "YTA.

Where is he?", "NTA and YTA.  Such a difficult situation! I completely understand your position, and really can\u2019t find fault with it.\n\nExcept.\n\nI\u2019m not sure it is your nature.  You raised a very caring son whose empathy is exceptional.  He recognizes that he has the power to profoundly impact the life of someone else.  He isn\u2019t asking you to do it, he\u2019s asking you to help.  You know none of this is her fault.  She is simply a little girl who has been abandoned at every turn.

Your son has allowed his father's bad behavior to completely derail his life and is now trying to use guilt to manipulate others into sharing the burden. \n\nI know that the foster system is often bad for kids, but I have to wonder how it would compare to the current situation. This child is being raised by a half-sibling who is in way over his head, and is presumably not equipped to be the best father. He certainly doesn't have a good father as a role model.

Kudos on your son for stepping up, but being involved is not your responsibility. It's funny how a few people say you're the asshole for not helping, but why is that? Because you're a woman, you should just roll over and play nice? That seems to be a common theme on these posts. Ignore your feelings and just suck it up.

Three boys who are now in their 20s and my daughter is 18. Their father and I divorced 6 years ago after learning he was cheating on me with the woman who was supposed to be my best friend. He got her pregnant which is why the affair was discovered. I hated them both from that moment on. Two months after I filed for divorce they lost their baby. But they stayed together and got married and had a daughter 3 years ago. My former friend died a year after her daughter was born after complications with her heart condition.\n\n18 months ago then ex abandoned his kids and nobody has seen him since. My son asked me if I would consider taking his half sister in and I told him that would never ever happen. He asked for me to help him to raise her and I said I would have no part in raising her. I acknowledged she was innocent but I told him I could not look at her without seeing what her parents did to me. None of my other children wanted to help either. My son decided he would still take responsibility for her. He dropped out of college and quit his part time job to work full time. Two months after taking her he and his siblings started to argue a lot because he wanted their help babysitting and he wanted them to know her but they refused. He asked for my help with babysitting on multiple occasions. I gave him some money to pay for a babysitter on a few occasions but told him I would not babysit.\n\nGetting to present day, the relationship between my middle son and the rest of my kids is at an all time low. He's ashamed of them and they do not want a relationship with their half sister. He feels we all owe her a family.\n\nNow he has decided he is going to try and trick me into caring about his half sister and be willing to do more. I learned through my daughter that he has talked about if he could move home and have me help with her or take over raising her (his half sister) it would be better for everyone.  He told us all he wants to host Christmas for the family this year and his siblings all said no. He begged me to come and said he really wants us to all be a family again. I told him I love him and I always will, but I have a very firm boundary around not being part of his half sister's life. So I will not show up to their home on Christmas. I also will not raise or help him raise her. I told him I heard about his grand plan and he needs to figure out an alternative because it will not happen.\n\nMy son told me I should try to be better than her parents. I should show everyone what an awesome mom I am and not only stand by him and help him with this, but give a little girl a mother who doesn't have one. He tried to say it would really annoy her mom if she were alive to know her little girl loved and knew me as her mom. I stood my ground on my no. He then told me I'm not being a good mom or a good person and if I don't agree then I'm the worst person in this whole equation.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pathetic. \n\nI hope if you choose to lay in this bed that you\u2019re okay with also losing your son to your hate because that\u2019s likely what\u2019s going to happen. \n\nGrow up and get over it.

He should do what's best for the child. And that is not a woman who doesn't want her, that looks at her, and only sees pain and resentment.

He has to own the consequences.", ">My son asked me if I would consider taking his half sister in and I told him that would never ever happen. He asked for me to help him to raise her and I said I would have no part in raising her. \n\n\n\n>Now he has decided he is going to try and trick me into caring about his half sister and be willing to do more. I learned through my daughter that he has talked about if he could move home and have me help with her or take over raising her (his half sister) it would be better for everyone.\n\n\nHe wants her to take the kid in and raise it herself.", "The cheating isn\u2019t the child\u2019s fault. It\u2019s just not her child. This child also isn\u2019t this woman\u2019s responsibility, at all. \n\nHer adult son made the decision to take the child in. It is absolutely no one else\u2019s responsibility to deal with but his. Forcing someone else to try and take care of a kid they aren\u2019t even related to and want nothing to do with, is not okay at all.", "She does have a parent. The dad. You can't make OP feel guilty for what her ex has done and still is doing.\nThe son needs to go after the dad. Make him pay child support and all other cost (daycare, nanny) incurred by him raising his sibling.\nOP has absolutely no responsibility in this.\nYes, the child is innocent but so is OP.\n\nEdit: spelling", "But the father is still alive, why not get him to step up?", "No one should be telling her she has to sacrifice her own mental well being for a child she had no hand in creating.  Yes it sucks for the child but that child\u2019s parents created those problems.  If the son wants to raise his sister that\u2019s great but he has no right to expect his mom to be part of that.", "I'm going to school to be a therapist and in therapy myself. No decent therapist would tell her that. Only the really crappy ones that shouldn't have a license anyway", "This is also here ex-husband\u2019s affair child.", "So? The son knew what adopting her meant and where his family stands on interacting with her. He made a choice that everyone else has to accept. Now he has to accept their choice.", "I don't think that will remain, honestly. I think they'll eventually come around. Mom has all this anger and hatred (I mean who wouldn't) and it's causing a lot of pain....6 years later. The other kids may not want that after a while. \n\nBut they may stay this way. Who knows. Who knows what she's saying.", "Surprised no one has told her to go \u201cNC\u201d with her own son.", "You're not wrong. And she doesn't have to. But it still makes her an asshole, imo.", "If this were any other child he adopted no one would think asking mom for help would be unreasonable. She\u2019s not helping because she can\u2019t respect her son loves a child she does not. Those aren\u2019t reasonable terms for a non-asshole parent.", "\u2026her son is inviting her over for Christmas. She is refusing. \n\nHow is that unreasonable. A Christmas invite is unreasonable now?", "It's not about the affair. It's about the child.", "And if that happens OP has every right to walk right out the door.", "Weird how you think this child doesn't already sense this. Kids know when they aren't loved or wanted. This woman is an asshole.", "They\u2019re assholes not for not considering the girl their sister but for rejecting their brother and refusing to be in his house. That\u2019s massive asshole move. What kind of a normal person won\u2019t visit their brother because they hate a child he\u2019s raising? None. Only assholes.", "I'm reserving judgement as what a mess to be in. But there's a gd chance you're other children are taking your lead on this", "Im going to bet they eventually come around.", "He chose to take in a little girl that needed a family. He doesn't even have contact with any of the parents, it's just a child! He is basically only asking his mother to be in the same room as his daughter.", "And OP is not an AH for turning down helping. She is totally justified with that.\n\nBut where it stands now, she is refusing to be in the same room as the child.", "Except to her son, she\u2019s not a symbol she\u2019s an actual human being who is his half-sister. He\u2019s being ostracized for not hating this child. It\u2019s quite gross and cruel.", "If so we're in the shoes of OP I would view the kid as my son's adopted child only if the some stopped trying to get me to take on responsibility of the adopted child. I don't know how OP feels about it but I'd be ok allowing a relationship develop organically but I wouldn't cave on the additional childcare.", "Was looking for this comment. I might feel different if the ex had passed too, but even the potential that I would have to interact with him after possibly getting attached to the little girl would be a definite NO THANK YOU. If that potential was removed then I would really just bite the bullet and help my son. But that\u2019s just me. I\u2019m going to say NTA because of the entirety of the situation.", "No but she birthed her son and her son is struggling and asking his mum for help and she is refusing to. So she\u2019s a shit parent for that. She cares more about her hatred for her ex than her own son.", "Yes but the child is not to blame for the affair. Why is this so hard for people to understand.", "So he should have ditched a child?", "Yeah he made the COMPASSIONATE choice to look after his innocent sister because no one else will! And asked his own mum for help, like many young people do who are looking after their own children. Yeesh.", "They more or less are - its a very dramatic and complex situation and people are treating it like OP is just simply turning down not babysitting for free.", "Nah, your parents are done raising kids. If they agree to help you, it's fine, but I don't think it's something you are entitled to. And that goes for any kids", "The child of the affair. That OP was very clear on her NOT being involved before he took her in.  That son is trying to force her to mother.", "She has every right not to walk through the door to begin with knowing that her AH son is capable of being a manipulative brat. Why would she put herself in that situation when she can make Christmas plans she knows she will enjoy from the start?", "This woman doesn\u2019t have any contact with the kid, so how would the kid know a stranger doesn\u2019t love them unless the son told the child she isn\u2019t wanted?", "But why are they rejecting their sister as their sister? wtf kind of shot is that. The kid is 3.", ">My son told me I should try to be better than her parents. I should show everyone what an awesome mom I am and not only stand by him and help him with this, but give a little girl a mother who doesn't have one. \n\nThis is why. I wouldn't go there either.", "Okay then her son can stop asking/demanding his siblings and mother participate in his choices. They made it very clear that they were not signing up for this, and he decided to do it anyway. If he wasn't constantly trying to manipulate them into being in her life, I'm sure things would be different.", "For me, personally, I might consider being around IF son fully adopted the little girl and not just legal guardian, AND if I was not expected to play a mom/grandma role.  Because if ex husband came back and suddenly wanted to play happy family I'd be triggered AF.  But the son here is the major problem for me. His behaviour would put me off of wanting to be around either of them.  He's not doing his sister any favours by trying to force people to take an interest in her, when nobody is interested.", "Her son created his own reality and he knew it would be hard.  He thought if he could get her to see the child she would change her mind.  If anything he has more of argument with the siblings than his mother, they are at least related to the child.", "I agree child is not to blame but I can\u2019t call this woman and AH for not wanting to have anything to do with her.  Her feeling are valid.", "Apparently from the comments the child has other family. It's nice of him to step up but that's his choice. He can't manipulate others to care for a child that is connected to trauma. He is being sneaky about it and blackmailing them into either accept her or loose me. If that's his route then he made his own bed.", "He is basically forcing someone else to do the good thing. You can't make people. They either do it of their own accord or don't. And he is not being kind. Do you think the girl will have a happy life if the Mom agrees to look after her just so her son stops begging, but she still will always resent her? Do you think the kid wouldn't notice? That's more cruel than finding her a place with her mothers family. And why is he not pestering the Dad to step up. The girls parent who actually is responsible. No he is asking his mom because he thinks she will give in for his sake.", "Yeah actually found someone who said she needs to go NC with her son to show him \u201cconsequences.\u201d As if adopting his abandoned half-sister is something BAD.", "It's not the child if the affair. They've been divorced for SIX YEARS!!! The kid is 3.", "Absolutely she has the right but think about that : she raised her son like that.", "You don't think she never overhears. Never sees or feels the stress?", "Neither of these parents sound like emotionally healthy people\u2014they both apparently like abandoning their kids who need help\u2014so not surprised most of their litter is the same.", "They won\u2019t come over to his house for Christmas. Who\u2019s manipulating who?", "Sometimes doing the moral thing is doing something we don\u2019t like.", "Oh silly me it's totally easy to forget that my husband and best friend fucked each other behind my back and then got married and had a kid that I'm supposed to pretend doesn't hurt every time I look at her/think about it.", "Or his father did. Remember him? The jackass who abandoned his child. Who cheated. Yeah\u2026 he\u2019s more likely the manipulative parent than OP", "That\u2019s on the son, her guardian. He is stressing himself out, he is exposing her to stress. How are you going to blame a third party for his choices?", "Right???!!!!!! I mean I don't condone cheating but there's usually reasons for it.", "are you just willfully ignoring the fact that he is constantly trying to force them to be a family with this girl?  All that doesn't go out the window just because it's fucking Christmas.", "Are people not allowed to refuse invitations now? Is saying no manipulative? Damn there goes my therapy i learned nothing", "He is manipulating everyone. It's blatant emotional blackmail."]}
