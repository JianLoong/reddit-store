My friend is a really good dude, let\u2019s call him Greg, but he is also extremely insecure and has a big ego which is a deadly combination.\n\nMy mere existence is emasculating for him. I am a woman and we were peers in college. I now hold a director position in tech making 6 figures and he is a doorman at an apartment complex.\n\nHe has made subtle jabs before at me, but I largely ignored it. One was when I invited our group of friends over to my recently purchased home, and he mumbled \u201cwow Daddy\u2019s money is nice!\u201d. When we go out to eat just us 2, I largely pay for him\u2026 interesting he doesn\u2019t bring up \u201cDaddy\u2019s money\u201d when it benefits him. He's sweet when its just us, but condescending in groups.\n\nHe\u2019s been getting really into \u201cfinance bro\u201d stuff like investing in stocks and crypto. And he\u2019s been getting on my nerves, trying to give me a bunch of advice on stocks I need to invest in, I largely ignore him.\n\nRecently, our group of friends went out to dinner. I mention that I had finally purchased a new car since my old 2005 Honda is out of commission. I bought a used 2022 Honda\u2026 nothing fancy. He asked about my monthly payments, I said I didn\u2019t have any. I bought my car outright. And he said \u201cWow you\u2019re bad with money, you should never have more than 20K in your checking account, you\u2019re losing money on investments.\u201dI said \u201cMy CPA seems to think its fine\u201d, and he said \u201cwell you should fire your CPA because he\u2019s a quack, I\u2019ll help you with your finances\u201d, so I responded \u201chuh, who should I listen to for financial advice? A professional Harvard grad with decades of experience, or a guy with less than 20K in his checking account with a degree in YouTube university?\u201d\n\nIt was an awkward 5 second silence after this before someone changed the subject. He didn\u2019t speak up at dinner again. Later he texted me that I was an asshole for embarrassing him like that in front of our friends. My other friends seem to think I should apologize too just to keep the peace but I disagree. Yes I talked back and probably hurt his ego, and I get that he\u2019s embarrassed about his financial situation and was just overcompensating for that. But he had been making jabs at me all night (example: my other friend talked about a career change and asked me to keep an eye out on open positions. Greg responds \u201cI highly doubt OP has any sway in her company, you\u2019re better off cold emailing people on LinkedIn\u201d. We both ignored him and continued chatting). This is the ONE time I talked back.I'm tired of always being the bigger person just because Greg is going through a hard time.\n\nTLDR: Friend has is only condescending towards me about finances.

He deserved the take-down not only as a natural consequence of his being an a-hole, but as forever reminder to never treat you that way again.  \n\nI seriously do not know why you care what he thinks, and do NOT humor your friends by apologizing to someone for the sole purpose of stroking their fragile ego.  You've already described his \"deadly\" combination of character flaws . . . you really don't want to be throwing fertilizer on that with an apology.", "NTA\n\nWow Greg can certainly dish it out but he can't take it. I think you've outgrown this relationship.", "NTA  but why are you friends with him when he is like that to you?  even only sometimes isnt acceptable", "Look, you clapped back and I'd say in an ideal world it wasn't the best way. But it's also fair game considering he's been trying to break you down to make himself feel better.\n\nMain thing is, I think you've gotta reflect on the fact that who he is when he's being consdescending and insecure and egotistical ***is also who he is***. He's not a really good dude who just *happens* to be condescending in groups, as though the condescension and snark is not really him.\n\nHe ***is*** a condescending, insecure guy who can apparently *only* be nice when it doesn't threaten his ego which is within very specific and restricted situations. He is happy to sacrifice you at any moment that his ego feels threatens. He is not giving you the same consideration that you were trying to give him by understanding that he's just insecure.\n\nAn actually good and sweet dude would not be trying to tear you down to make himself feel better. They wouldn't try to throw their friend under the bus to boost their ego. Just because you know it comes from insecurity doesn't make it ok.\n\nI point this out because I was close friends with a very similar guy and it took me a long time to stop mentally separating the 'he's a good dude at heart' vs 'he acts like such an AH in groups, to my detriment'. They're *both* him. And people like that rely on and expect others to keep giving them a pass to act an AH because they're insecure.\n\nYou shouldn't, and it won't get any better with/around him as long as you do.\n\nYou can talk it out with him and see if you can get it through his head that it's not ok to act like this, if you want to invest the energy, but I don't think you owe him an apology unless he wants to bring one first.\n\nNTA", "NTA. His dressing down was long overdue. You are an easy target for his AH behavior because you're his friend and he knew you wouldn't challenge him (until now). By speaking up for yourself, you've finally shown him you won't tolerate disrespect. Your friends are AHs too for standing by and letting him say these things to you, but jumping down your throat when you finally talked back. Never feel bad for defending yourself. Your \"friends\" have just proven they won't do it for you.", "NTA, he's just butthurt you're more successful and his internalized misogyny is quite palpable if he thinks YOU need advice from HIM after you've earned your success so fluidly in comparison...... The whole concept of \"emasculation\" is bullshit in and of itself, like the idea of being feminine is weaker or less worthy of strength and power. It's a crock of shit and he can wallow in it because deep down it's not a *you* problem, its his for thinking woman couldn't possibly hold a higher position of power just for being women..... The fact that he's been entirely condescending even still after you've gained so much success is quite telling of this. \n\nI've watched men cry just from a period cramp simulator so really men can emasculate themselves just fine. Women are well aware of our strength, and confident men are well aware of this and definitely not threatened by it.", "NTA.  He's the one making the nasty comments and gets all offended when you finally respond?  Nope.  \n \n\nHonestly, this doesn't sound like someone you should stay in touch with.  Stop protecting mediocre male egos.  It's too much work on your part and doesn't do them any favors.", "You should use his text to have some frank communication. \n\n>he texted me that I was an asshole for embarrassing him like that in front of our friends.\n\nAsk him why he thinks it's ok to jab at you over and over - insulting your money management, saying that you are living off daddy's money, telling your friends that you dont have contacts - in front of friends, but not ok for you to respond? \n\nTell him that you are going to point out every single time he insults you in the future, and he doesnt get any more free insults anymore. If he wants to dish it out, he can take it too.  \n\nYou're not doing him any favors by tiptoeing around his insecurities.  \n\nNTA", "NTA.  This dude seems happy to use OP for their money, but he sure doesn't sound like a friend.", "He's  not your friend.", "NTA He tried to embarrass you and impress everyone else with his financial knowledge.  He only embarrassed himself.   As a rule, anyone who is qualified to be giving financial advice has their personal finances in order, as a bare minimum.", "NTA.  He's used to the same routine with you.  Now that you've put the ball in his court, lets see how he responds.  As the saying goes, it seems like he can dish it, but can't take it.", "INFO: \"My friend is a really good dude\"  How so?", "NTA and while you may be his friend, he isn't yours.", "NTA. He says rude comments to you about you and your finances. Instead of being a good friend and saying good on you for buying a car outright and not financing he\u2019s just being a condescending a-hole. He\u2019s making fun of your success to make himself feel better. That\u2019s not what friends do.", "He's not a sweet guy. Your friends sat by and listened to him take all those jabs and didn't say anything? I can't tell who sucks more, they or the dude. It seems unlikely but if you value his friendship you could write him one email and lay it all out. \"Dude, I really value our friendship but I can't tolerate the nonstop jabs and insults. You've been such a good friend that I think there's a chance you aren't aware you're doing it so here's some examples.... If you can commit to stopping I'd love to keep hanging out but I need you to stop insulting me. \n\nI would then send the note to them and say you'd like to  give him a chance to turn it around, but that you won't be sitting by for a non stop series of jabs. And that you're disappointed in them that they didn't step up and say anything when they saw it going on.   NTA.", "NTA \n\nBased off the beginning of the post it seems like Greg only does this when conversations touch on money/finances? If this isn't a deal breaker for your friendship (though I'd understand if it was) maybe that's just not a topic y'all talk about anymore?\n\nHowever, if this is a friend that you value outside of this insecure bs they pull, you should definitely have a sit down with him. You don't have to apologize if you don't want but if you're gonna be friends with him you need to tell him that this is annoying, hurtful, and it makes your friend group not want to be around him. \n\nGive him a chance to stop being this way. I've seen more than one immature/insecure person turn it around because deep down they do love their friends more than they hate themselves for where they are at in their lives.", "Greg is a dick. He must be an all star in other areas because based on what you have written, I don\u2019t see why you would put up with ongoing condescending comments like this. What you said was harsh, but I think necessary in this case. NTA", "NTA - But you could have handled it better, why even get into finances with this guy at all? Why mention you don't have loans on your car? I also paid for mine with cash but this is the only time I've ever mentioned it. I have a friend who also suggests investment options for people who make less than a certain amount, I say thanks and move on even though I make too much to invest in those. He's not your friend, but if you're making more than others in your social circle in general, just don't get into that conversation.", "NTA.  You can, and should, ignore his insecurity until he brings it right up to your face and makes it impossible for you to do so.  Which he did.  He tried to make you look bad.  You responded in what is a reasonable way.\n\nThe fact is that you were making him look bad all along.  Or rather, he was.  I am sure everybody was already aware you were being the bigger person, and that he was being extremely small.", "NTA \n\nI note you mentioned in the beginning that this is not a true reflection of Greg, only one facet. I would use that and maybe say something to him, but you don't have to. \n\nI myself am a CPA and work in the finance industry. And can confirm his advice was terrible!!!!! LOL. For many reasons, but the main reason being he is NOT a qualified financial advisor and doesn't understand what financial advice actually is. In the biz, we call this BBQ chat. \n\nHowever, to maintain the friendship and his ego, it might be an idea to say something. Maybe say something to the effect of 'Greg, you're great. One of my best buds. However when it comes to finance it's clear we're not on the same page as I clearly have a much more conservative and defensive strategy to you. So good about we agree to disagree and move on?'\n\nAnd just tell your other friends it's all sorted between the 2 of you.", "NTA.  Does Greg only take jabs at you?  Not at your other friends?  How come you're his designated ego-stroker?  Tell your other so-called friends they need to jump in and change the subject or ask him for financial advice when he starts up.  If they leave you to handle his bullshit by yourself they don't get to complain about how you do it.  How come he can control himself around every one else but you?", "NTA. Sounds like you've outgrown Greg.", "Nta and no you don't need to apologize to a delusional looser like him. I have no idea why he is punching up, it truly was a fun read! \n\nHe needs a dose of reality!", "NTA, this guy sounds insufferable.", "NTA, if he is willing to jab, he has to take them. Don't let others guilt you into \"keeping the peace\" This just enables his behavior.", "NTA,  it was rude but deserved. You can only take so much. Also, buying a car with cash is smart, investing in individual stocks and crypto based your friends tips is not. If you want financial advise, listen to Dave Ramsey\u2019s podcast.  Every 3rd or 5th show he tells you not to take financial advice from broke people.", "I'm leaning more towards NTA than Everyone Sucks Here, because there is only so much belittling one can take before they snap back. Would it have been a better idea to have told him when he first started making these sort of comments that you won't tolerate him talking you to that way, and he should keep his financial comments to himself? Of course, hindsight is 20/20 after all. But he also shouldn't be insulting you for any reason, especially when your financial situations are very different, and based on your own account, that you buy this man food even after he has insulted you in the past.", "ESH. He was a jerk, but you took it too far with the insult. I would apologize, but tell him that from this point forward, finances are no longer a topic of conversation between you two.", "ESH, but I honestly don't blame you for putting him in his place. If you're really friends, then he shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it. If he's going to talk smack about you in front of other people, he should be prepared to have it handed back to him.\n\nI suspect this guy is far too insecure to hold up his end of your friendship. Real friends don't tear each other down, and this comments of his you've posted seem pretty mean.", "NTA, but I suggest having a conversation with him explaining why you said what you did. His treatment of you is not ok and he isn't acting like your friend.", "ESH.\n\nHe certainly sounds like an asshole as you describe, but to put him down like that in front of your whole group of friends was completely uncalled for.  You could have easily changed the subject and dealt with it in private.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
