Julia is a self-proclaimed \"style dictator\" and often says my style is boring, but I like it so I don't care.

I compliment her whenever we go out, and she always appreciates it.\n\nAs for me, I have been on a no-buy since January. It was one of my goals for 2022 and I'm really proud I've stuck to it. Recently, I have rediscovered a love for my skinny jeans. I find them really comfortable, they go great with tall boots, and they keep my legs warm (which is something I struggle with).\n\nWell, Julia hates them, and doesn't make much of an effort to hide it. She's obviously allowed not to like them, but her remarks got tiring after a while. I started avoiding wearing them around her to avoid having to hear about how they're \"cheugy\" and ugly.\n\nYesterday, I met up with a few friends for sushi. Julia doesn't like sushi, so she said she'd sit this one out. One of the guys invited us to his house for board games. He posted it on his story and Julia DM'd him asking if she and her sister could come. We all said yes.\n\nThe first thing Julia commented on when she arrived were my jeans; I laughed it off and changed the topic. Later, someone started talking about dinosaurs and Julia said skinny jeans were also prehistoric. I again changed the topic, but was starting to feel self-conscious about my outfit. After several comments about my skinny jeans being ugly and unfashionable, I tried to make her drop it by jokingly saying, \"Just because you can't pull them off doesn't mean they're ugly.\"\n\nI thought the conversation would end there, but instead she got upset and started screaming at me for being an inconsiderate and insensitive bitch, and how dare I fatshame her in front of everyone. She locked herself in the bathroom, with her sister chasing after her.\n\nBasically, Julia thought I meant that she couldn't pull them off because she's fat. I was horrified she would think that, so I went to apologize that it came off that way, and that it wasn't my intention. She yelled at me that it was a bullshit apology and to leave her alone, and that \"being a skinny bitch\" (I'm not) doesn't give me the right to be fatphobic.\n\nI decided to go home to avoid spoiling the evening for the others and because I felt bad for hurting Julia. My friends are saying I shouldn't have left and that she overreacted. I messaged Julia to apologize again, and now I'm blocked. \n\nI genuinely thought it was obvious that I was referring to style and not to her size.

Setting boundaries is very important, I agree with you there. I wouldn't say the friend is toxic, just obnoxious. Julia blowing up over one comment indicates issues that aren't OP's responsibility.

If they don't want to do that, they simply walk away from the friendship.  Both of those actions would be completely fine (even if they pissed off the \"fashion dictator\"). \n\nBut lashing out, to someone who we do not know for a fact is a bully, and was never told that it was unacceptable, doesn't suddenly remove OP from the fact that the phrasing they used sounds like fatshaming, which is a MUCH more pointed and painful attack than \"I don't like your fashion choices\" - no matter how often repeated.", "It doesn't read like an innocent jab... \"you can't pull that off\" is USUALLY a physical commentary - you don't have the body or carriage to rock a look. \n\nThis isn't a screaming \"JESUS I hate when you do this shit to me!\" which okay maybe not nice, but.. I'd be more likely to go everyone sucks with... But I understand completely why the friend read it as a body comment, because to be honest if someone said that to me, it's what I'd hear (and i'm a 40 something year old woman, I'm in okay shape for my age, but I don't live in the gym, and am not a huge fashion horse.. Just average..).. \n\nSo when someone makes judgemental comments about my clothing, and I flashback with a comment that is USUALLY a bodyshaming comment?  I'm not in the right.  Clothing is a choice, bodies are not.", "NOPE, that changes EVERYTHING...  You said to stop and she said no.. We're done..  You are not the asshole.

Yeah, nope.", "I don't agree with a word you said You seem to imply that OP should bend over backwards and and walk on eggshells with the friend well she do all the accommodating.

Where I live it's quite common (or at least I've heard it multiple times) to say \"I can't pull off orange to save my life\" or \"I can't pull off long dresses\" without it being a negative comment on one's appearance. Well, definitely won't be using that saying anymore...", "Julia? Is that you?", "OP said it wasn't a comment about her body. It was a comment about the style. Yes, it is often a comment made about physicality as youve stated,  youre correct about that. But you're still ignoring how the friend constantly berates OP about the jeans. She keeps bringing it up multiple times in irrelevant situations, such as the dinosaur comment. She will *not* drop it. Was OP just supposed to roll over and keep taking it?
