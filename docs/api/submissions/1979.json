I compliment her whenever we go out, and she always appreciates it.\n\nAs for me, I have been on a no-buy since January. It was one of my goals for 2022 and I'm really proud I've stuck to it. Recently, I have rediscovered a love for my skinny jeans. I find them really comfortable, they go great with tall boots, and they keep my legs warm (which is something I struggle with).\n\nWell, Julia hates them, and doesn't make much of an effort to hide it. She's obviously allowed not to like them, but her remarks got tiring after a while. I started avoiding wearing them around her to avoid having to hear about how they're \"cheugy\" and ugly.\n\nYesterday, I met up with a few friends for sushi. Julia doesn't like sushi, so she said she'd sit this one out. One of the guys invited us to his house for board games. He posted it on his story and Julia DM'd him asking if she and her sister could come. We all said yes.\n\nThe first thing Julia commented on when she arrived were my jeans; I laughed it off and changed the topic. Later, someone started talking about dinosaurs and Julia said skinny jeans were also prehistoric. I again changed the topic, but was starting to feel self-conscious about my outfit. After several comments about my skinny jeans being ugly and unfashionable, I tried to make her drop it by jokingly saying, \"Just because you can't pull them off doesn't mean they're ugly.\"\n\nI thought the conversation would end there, but instead she got upset and started screaming at me for being an inconsiderate and insensitive bitch, and how dare I fatshame her in front of everyone. She locked herself in the bathroom, with her sister chasing after her.\n\nBasically, Julia thought I meant that she couldn't pull them off because she's fat. I was horrified she would think that, so I went to apologize that it came off that way, and that it wasn't my intention. She yelled at me that it was a bullshit apology and to leave her alone, and that \"being a skinny bitch\" (I'm not) doesn't give me the right to be fatphobic.\n\nI decided to go home to avoid spoiling the evening for the others and because I felt bad for hurting Julia. My friends are saying I shouldn't have left and that she overreacted. I messaged Julia to apologize again, and now I'm blocked. \n\nI genuinely thought it was obvious that I was referring to style and not to her size.

Setting boundaries is very important, I agree with you there. I wouldn't say the friend is toxic, just obnoxious. Julia blowing up over one comment indicates issues that aren't OP's responsibility.

If they don't want to do that, they simply walk away from the friendship.  Both of those actions would be completely fine (even if they pissed off the \"fashion dictator\"). \n\nBut lashing out, to someone who we do not know for a fact is a bully, and was never told that it was unacceptable, doesn't suddenly remove OP from the fact that the phrasing they used sounds like fatshaming, which is a MUCH more pointed and painful attack than \"I don't like your fashion choices\" - no matter how often repeated.", "It doesn't read like an innocent jab... \"you can't pull that off\" is USUALLY a physical commentary - you don't have the body or carriage to rock a look. \n\nThis isn't a screaming \"JESUS I hate when you do this shit to me!\" which okay maybe not nice, but.. I'd be more likely to go everyone sucks with... But I understand completely why the friend read it as a body comment, because to be honest if someone said that to me, it's what I'd hear (and i'm a 40 something year old woman, I'm in okay shape for my age, but I don't live in the gym, and am not a huge fashion horse.. Just average..).. \n\nSo when someone makes judgemental comments about my clothing, and I flashback with a comment that is USUALLY a bodyshaming comment?  I'm not in the right.  Clothing is a choice, bodies are not.", "NOPE, that changes EVERYTHING...  You said to stop and she said no.. We're done..  You are not the asshole.

Yeah, nope.", "I don't agree with a word you said You seem to imply that OP should bend over backwards and and walk on eggshells with the friend well she do all the accommodating.

Where I live it's quite common (or at least I've heard it multiple times) to say \"I can't pull off orange to save my life\" or \"I can't pull off long dresses\" without it being a negative comment on one's appearance. Well, definitely won't be using that saying anymore...", "Julia? Is that you?", "OP said it wasn't a comment about her body. It was a comment about the style. Yes, it is often a comment made about physicality as youve stated,  youre correct about that. But you're still ignoring how the friend constantly berates OP about the jeans. She keeps bringing it up multiple times in irrelevant situations, such as the dinosaur comment. She will *not* drop it. Was OP just supposed to roll over and keep taking it?

Pun intended.", "I just don't get why people put up with such blatant disrespect. Sunk cost fallacy maybe??", "I wonder if she's been more heavily on Tik Tok during her \"Tik Tok phase\" and the negativity she's engaging with/in there is bleeding over into her offline life.", "It will hurt like taking a giant dump but boy does it feel good afterwards.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

So she proclaimed herself to be able to go around insulting other peoples\u2019 style that she doesn\u2019t like to make them change to conform to her likes? That\u2019s absolutely deranged in its narcissism. \n\nAlso, personally I think that low rise skinny jeans popular like 15 years ago look significantly better than the more current mom jeans, and especially better than high-wasted styles that became popular since. If I were insane enough to call myself a \u201cstyle dictator\u201d in a non-ironic way, I would deem your style perfectly fine.", "NTA!  She was continually putting you down for your fashion choice and then when you clapped back she played the victim.  Stop apologizing.

P insulted your friend thinks skinny jeans are out of style.", "NTA. You already apologized for how it came off. Sometimes things come out wrong or are said in a way that can be taken wrong. It happens. We're human. She didn't have to throw a tantrum over it. \n\nYou took her bullying you over your skinny jeans for long enough. You kept trying to change the subject but she just kept wanting to go. I have to applaud you for not snapping completely on her.", "NTA. Fat people can pull off skinny jeans just fine.

It sounds like you're putting up with an awful lot of negativity. Yeah, you were jokingly rude to her, but she was genuinely rude to you by constantly criticising your outfit.", "As soon as I read \u201cTikTok era\u201d and \u201ccheugy\u201d I came to the conclusion that Julia is the AH regardless of anything else that happened.", "NTA. I feel has she is projecting her insecurities on to you, and that why she reacted the way she did at your comment and is constantly making comments about your skinny jeans. She should dish out the digs if she can\u2019t take it back! If this is how she always is, she sounds exhausting to be around. You offered her a sincere apology and even your group of friends say she overreacted. Her insecurities are not yours to deal with.", "NTA. I think your friend is the AH. It\u2019s one thing to make fun of skinny jeans in general but she is constantly harassing you. Yes, what you said wasn\u2019t great, but she just would not stop making fun of you.", "NTA Your friend is an AH. She can insult your clothing repeatedly and make you feel self conscious about what you are wearing and you take it, and take it. When you finally say something not about her body she freaks out. I wouldn't be friends with someone like this. She constantly puts you down, probably to make herself feel better about herself. You don't pretend to be a fashionista. You are just trying to live your life in comfort.\n\nYour friend wouldn't insult your clothing choices repeatedly, and in public if she were a true friend. Self esteem is hard enough to come by without a supposed friend constantly tearing you down. You need more empathetic, and positive friends. She is trying to make her candle brighter by dimming yours.", "What I don\u2019t get is that all these TikTok Zoomers are literally recreating looks from past decades. While at the same time making fun of \u2018older\u2019 looks. This happens all the time, with every generation, and they\u2019re so far from original it\u2019s laughable. They\u2019ll get older and see it happen to them and cringe at how they thought chokers and crop tops and baggy jeans were \u2018such a cool lewk.\u2019\n\nGag me with a spoon.", "Lol. You didn't Fanshame her. You made one remark after she was consistently berating you for wearing what YOU want to.  Not your fault she's self conscious and projected her insecurity on you.

Don\u2019t continue apologizing for something she is taking the wrong way.", "She reacted that way because SHE knows she can\u2019t pull them off because she\u2019s fat.

You hit it right on the head and she can\u2019t take it. For someone who\u2019s so into fashion her tolerance for criticism is pathetic. She would be eaten alive in the actual fashion world.
