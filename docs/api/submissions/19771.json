If she took the baby for 2-3 hours during the day so mom could sleep, mom could handle the nighttimes better. You all three need to sit down and work out a plan so that you all get enough sleep. There are 3 of you and one baby - make a plan. When baby is asleep - mom is asleep if she's breastfeeding. This won't last forever. Even if you got up 15 minutes early to change the baby then take it to your wife to feed her, it would probably help.", "Info: Nothing is ever is so cut and dry. You should be able to find some compromise. You give some and get some. What time are you back from work? What your schedule look like, hour by hour? What does your wife's look like? Include sleeping hours as well.", "I\u2019ve been married for 28 years, two kids, 25 and 15. My husband also worked construction during the younger years and we ran our own construction business as they got older. Having a newborn is hard. It takes everything out of you and can be extremely stressful. I always took it upon myself to be sure and be up with the baby during the night so that he was able to sleep and be ready for those early morning work hours. When he came home he helped me with the babies and if I needed it, I took a nap while he did that. I stayed home and I did as much as I could to make things easier for him as he worked a high stress, physically demanding job outside the home. But we always made sure that each of our needs was being met and communicated with each other. This is the key. What are your needs? What are your limits? What do each of you expect from each other. Being tired after a baby clouds everything and can be super emotional for everyone, but especially the mom. It would help if you guys can talk this out and lay out your terms so to speak. Get a schedule and stick to it so that you both are comfortable and feel heard. The mother issue is a whole other thing. Sometimes it can be helpful and sometimes a for real nightmare. I wish you guys the best. I guess my judgement is everyone needs to be open and have more grace for each other during this time.", "INFO- Does your MIL truly only criticize your parenting style or did she help out around the house and with the baby?

Your concern with work is very valid, so you both need to assess the tradeoff. maybe you call off on days you need to be up at night. maybe that's not an option so you hire a nanny or housekeeper so Wife can get some rest in the daytime. Maybe there are other parents in the neighborhood that are willing to pool resources or services to support each other. Maybe you take some housework when you get back from work. Maybe none of these solutions work for you, but my point is that you and your wife are a team, and should be working together to make sure your needs are met.\n\nYour feelings about MIL are valid, how does Wife feel about her? If you both feel shes doing more harm that good, then work together to resolve that.

Whenever there was a newborn involved, my husband said he\u2019d rather he shared the nights/feeds and was a bit tired at work, than have me caring for children or driving etc in extreme sleep deprivation with all the children in the car. He\u2019d rather literally any other outcome than burying his entire family if I fell asleep at the wheel trying to get children to school and constant medical appointments etc etc. Or had an accident at home, or got lost in the nightmare of post-natal depression. He\u2019d rather risk losing anything or anyone else. Because nothing would be as bad as losing us.\n\nSo we took turns, and we both got a full night of rest every second night.

I'm a (M34) and my wife is (F32). We've been married for 6 fantastic years and we recently had our first child, a beautiful girl who's now 6 weeks old. Things have been tumultuous lately, and I'm not sure if I'm the one being unreasonable.  \nI work a physically demanding job in construction that starts at 6 a.m. This means I have to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to get ready and commute. My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents. My wife is on a year-long maternity leave and has the responsibility of caring for our baby throughout the day.  \nHere's the problem. Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night. My wife has been insisting that I help with these late-night feedings and changes, but I've explained to her that a lack of sleep could seriously jeopardize my performance at work and my own safety.  \nTo add more drama into the mix, my mother-in-law has moved in with us to \"help\" with the baby. However, her idea of help often involves criticizing my wife's parenting, which only adds to her stress, and dictating how we should run our household. She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.  \nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.  \nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother.

She doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go or anything to do that isn\u2019t baby or household related. She is probably still in pain from delivery and may also be in pain from nursing.

In the meantime, the best thing you can do is to help whenever and wherever you can (maybe on your days off work, or by hiring help with chores if that\u2019s an option), give her lots of emotional support, validate what she\u2019s going through, be generally in awe that she is keeping this extremely needy thing alive. \n\nIf anyone is an AH it\u2019s the MIL, who it seems is helping less than she is causing stress. You may do better to talk to wife privately to see how everyone can support her better, or talk to her mom privately about keeping her \u201chelp\u201d positive, but honestly it should all be about this new mom who is really going through it and is in probably way harder than she ever expected.", "NAH - New kids can be very draining.

From my own experience, I could not sleep during the day no matter if baby was sleeping or not. According to my own mother I stopped taking naps at 9 months old and 30 years later the trend still holds. I *had* to have help at night or I was going to lose my mind. Thankfully my husband could help at that time. But he also works a job that when it\u2019s busy he could die or kill someone else if he doesn\u2019t get adequate sleep so we agreed at that time that if we ever had another we would arrange for nighttime help for me. Thankfully we subsequently decided to be one and done but I knew that if we had another we\u2019d either have family rotate through to help with nights or hire a night nurse. If OPs wife has similar issues with sleep she needs to communicate those needs and either ask her mother to contribute or find another solution. It\u2019s also in nobody\u2019s interest to have a mother so out of her mind from lack of sleep that she hurts herself or the baby (accidentally or through postpartum psychosis). Not everyone can sleep during the day no matter the circumstances. But if OPs wife is the type that can nap she needs to take more naps, and suck it up a bit at night if her mother won\u2019t help.
