I'm a (M34) and my wife is (F32). We've been married for 6 fantastic years and we recently had our first child, a beautiful girl who's now 6 weeks old. Things have been tumultuous lately, and I'm not sure if I'm the one being unreasonable.\n\nI work a physically demanding job in construction that starts at 6 a.m. This means I have to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to get ready and commute. My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents. My wife is on a year-long maternity leave and has the responsibility of caring for our baby throughout the day.\n\nHere's the problem. Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night. My wife has been insisting that I help with these late-night feedings and changes, but I've explained to her that a lack of sleep could seriously jeopardize my performance at work and my own safety.\n\nTo add more drama into the mix, my mother-in-law has moved in with us to \"help\" with the baby. However, her idea of help often involves criticizing my wife's parenting, which only adds to her stress, and dictating how we should run our household. She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.\n\nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.\n\nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother. I feel bad, but I also think that the current situation isn't sustainable.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to assist with our newborn at night due to the nature of my job, and for asking my intrusive MIL to leave?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \n\nI should also mention that I have two stepsons from my wife's previous relationship. In addition to my work and the baby duties, I also pick them up from school, help with their homework, and take them to their sports practices after I get off work. It's not just about the newborn; we have a whole family to take care of. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lounging around sipping a beer post-work.

If she took the baby for 2-3 hours during the day so mom could sleep, mom could handle the nighttimes better. You all three need to sit down and work out a plan so that you all get enough sleep. There are 3 of you and one baby - make a plan. When baby is asleep - mom is asleep if she's breastfeeding. This won't last forever. Even if you got up 15 minutes early to change the baby then take it to your wife to feed her, it would probably help.", "Info: Nothing is ever is so cut and dry. You should be able to find some compromise. You give some and get some. What time are you back from work? What your schedule look like, hour by hour? What does your wife's look like? Include sleeping hours as well.", "I\u2019ve been married for 28 years, two kids, 25 and 15. My husband also worked construction during the younger years and we ran our own construction business as they got older. Having a newborn is hard. It takes everything out of you and can be extremely stressful. I always took it upon myself to be sure and be up with the baby during the night so that he was able to sleep and be ready for those early morning work hours. When he came home he helped me with the babies and if I needed it, I took a nap while he did that. I stayed home and I did as much as I could to make things easier for him as he worked a high stress, physically demanding job outside the home. But we always made sure that each of our needs was being met and communicated with each other. This is the key. What are your needs? What are your limits? What do each of you expect from each other. Being tired after a baby clouds everything and can be super emotional for everyone, but especially the mom. It would help if you guys can talk this out and lay out your terms so to speak. Get a schedule and stick to it so that you both are comfortable and feel heard. The mother issue is a whole other thing. Sometimes it can be helpful and sometimes a for real nightmare. I wish you guys the best. I guess my judgement is everyone needs to be open and have more grace for each other during this time.\n\nEditing this to say, OP - you are definitely NTA! I hope you guys can work through this and come up with solutions that make this work for each of you. That compromise and grace can become the norm for you.", "I N F O- Does your MIL truly only criticize your parenting style or did she help out around the house and with the baby?

It sounds like there\u2019s a big lack in communication over who should be responsible for what parenting duties. It sounds like MIL could pitch in more with the older two kids. It sounds like your wife isn\u2019t communicating what she\u2019s expecting from her mom and you.

Obviously you work a lot, and she may be doing more of the baby duties, but this stuff probably should be talked about beforehand ...", "ESH\n\nIt doesn't sound like everyone's needs are being effectively communicated.\n\nWife is telling you that she needs help with late night feedings and changes. Your concern with work is very valid, so you both need to assess the tradeoff. maybe you call off on days you need to be up at night. maybe that's not an option so you hire a nanny or housekeeper so Wife can get some rest in the daytime. Maybe there are other parents in the neighborhood that are willing to pool resources or services to support each other. Maybe you take some housework when you get back from work. Maybe none of these solutions work for you, but my point is that you and your wife are a team, and should be working together to make sure your needs are met.\n\nYour feelings about MIL are valid, how does Wife feel about her? If you both feel shes doing more harm that good, then work together to resolve that. If Wife finds value in MIL's presence, maybe you let it go.", "YTA.\n\nFWIW I\u2019ve raised 4 children with my husband. Whenever there was a newborn involved, my husband said he\u2019d rather he shared the nights/feeds and was a bit tired at work, than have me caring for children or driving etc in extreme sleep deprivation with all the children in the car. He\u2019d rather literally any other outcome than burying his entire family if I fell asleep at the wheel trying to get children to school and constant medical appointments etc etc. Or had an accident at home, or got lost in the nightmare of post-natal depression. He\u2019d rather risk losing anything or anyone else. Because nothing would be as bad as losing us.\n\nSo we took turns, and we both got a full night of rest every second night. So no one was severely sleep deprived. In that system if you have one rough night with a baby you can function ok and you\u2019ll get rest the next night. But you\u2019re letting your wife shoulder severe sleep deprivation alone every single night without any relief, and that is a dangerous game that you\u2019re drastically underestimating. You\u2019re undervaluing her life, her worth and her responsibilities to other dependent lives.\n\nAnd then you removed the only support she had. Wow. Good luck with that. \n\nSeriously if your job is so important and dangerous it requires your 24/7 availability, and you feel it absolves you from parenting at night\u2026hire her a night nanny with all that overtime pay you\u2019re sacrificing her for.", "Soft YTA.

My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents. My wife is on a year-long maternity leave and has the responsibility of caring for our baby throughout the day.  \nHere's the problem. Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night. My wife has been insisting that I help with these late-night feedings and changes, but I've explained to her that a lack of sleep could seriously jeopardize my performance at work and my own safety.  \nTo add more drama into the mix, my mother-in-law has moved in with us to \"help\" with the baby. However, her idea of help often involves criticizing my wife's parenting, which only adds to her stress, and dictating how we should run our household. She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.  \nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.  \nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother. I feel bad, but I also think that the current situation isn't sustainable.  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to assist with our newborn at night due to the nature of my job, and for asking my intrusive MIL to leave?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But if MIL is going to make life more stressful for OPs wife, then a night nurse might be needed if finances allow. From my own experience, I could not sleep during the day no matter if baby was sleeping or not. According to my own mother I stopped taking naps at 9 months old and 30 years later the trend still holds. I *had* to have help at night or I was going to lose my mind. Thankfully my husband could help at that time. But he also works a job that when it\u2019s busy he could die or kill someone else if he doesn\u2019t get adequate sleep so we agreed at that time that if we ever had another we would arrange for nighttime help for me.

Deal with it. If your wife says she's overall helpful despite the added stress of fighting, your MIL needs to be there.\n\nIf you aren't willing to have your MIL back, you need to stop accepting ANY weekend shifts so you can do every single Friday and Saturday night feeding yourself.

If possible, the first thing you should cut is working overtime. If you absolutely have to work overtime, then you and your wife need to find someone to help with overnights.

If she has to drive during the day - to appointments or for various tasks - that too is dangerous. \n\nGenerally my advice is to divide and conquer - make sure both parents are getting a decent amount of sleep, take it in shifts. Eg. She goes to bed at 7pm and sleeps until 11pm while he takes charge of the baby, and then after that he sleeps while she deals with any wakings. If that\u2019s not feasible, he could go to bed earlier than get up 1-2 hours earlier and deal with feeding and changing in that time, put the baby back down and hope she then gets a few hours of uninterrupted sleep.

He came back Fri night, I was extremely ill, coule barely breathe, but we agreed to go back to the ER the next day. The next morning I couldn't breathe.

Multiple doctors told my husband I wouldn't survive that night. But, here I am, lol. I then had multiple other episodes of blood clots, in my legs, arms, lungs, abdomen, brain, eye, etc. I haven't been able to work for 15 years and for ~7 years my husband had to take over doing everything, and kinda watch me like I was a kid - old enough to not walk out in traffic, but young enough to struggle with planning and follow through. I've slowly recovered some, but I still can't work and have a lot of deficits from the strokes. But, I can take basic care of myself and exist like an adult. It's amazing to me every day and I am so grateful. \n\nI think we survived for two reasons. The first is the biggest - we fought this as a team. It was always the two of us against the world (as lame-o as that sounds). My husband never blamed me, never put pressure on me, never made any negative assumptions about me. In all possible ways, this is *our* illness. It's not perfect. He can sometimes slip back into \"head of household\" mode and that pisses me off. But he's open to be called out and will always adjust his behavior.\n\nThe second reason is that as I was starting to recover we had friends (a couple ~10 years older than us, they'd been together 20 years) and the wife was recovering from a long term illness and it was driving their marriage to divorce. Her husband took mine aside and told him that there were 3 stages to this - the people you were at the beginning, the people you became when one of you got really sick, and the people you became when that spouse started to recover. He then said that, sometimes, due to no one's fault, those two people aren't compatible anymore and it would destroy the marriage. The issue, he said, was that none of this was expected. None of it was voluntary. And you couldn't plan for it. In their marriage, they had drifted further and further apart until things broke. That conversation scared the crap out of my husband. He's been on lookout for any of that happening and has worked hard to change with me. When we've been at different stages, and struggling because of it, we talk it out and try to rebalance. \n\nIt's not easy. I'm so sorry that you find yourself ill so early and that your life looks so much different than expected. I get it. It's a hard adjustment. There is absolutely nothing fair in any of it. \n\nBut, if you still love each other, no one's being abusive, and you *want* to be together, I 100% think you can fight through the hard stuff. Having a partner should make tihe hard stuff easier. Hopefully it will be.\n\nIntimacy is hard in these situations. Dealing with ongoing medical issues doesn't feel sexy. It feels isolating and like you took the wrong left turn and are now watching your old life through ancient, wavy glass. You can see it, you just can't live it. I'd say snuggle as much as you can and be as open and honest as you can. In my experience, the happiest marriages are ones where you can be wholly honest and still feel safe and protected. If you can't be fully honest, it'll cause a strain. And, for us, that honesty took the place of connection and intimacy when it had to. If you're being completely honest, your walls are down, like they would be if you were connecting. One might lead to the other. \n\nOh, last thing in this novella... if you're open to it and can go, couples therapy was a big help. We talked through all the struggles, dealt with the frustrations, and communicated much better. It also helped us clear up past resentments and unsolved disagreements. \n\nGood luck! I know you said it's unlikely, but I'm sending healing thoughts, hoping you might get to recover and leave this behind you.", "It gets better!

If someone needs help and asks their spouse to step up, the spouse should step up. End of story.", "Omg yes!!!! Its ridiculous!", "Well, for what it\u2019s worth a baby can die if the parents aren\u2019t able to function due to lack of sleep. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a contest I don\u2019t think they have to compare. I imagine they\u2019re both feeling unappreciated and exhausted and it\u2019s hard to have your mother-in-law around.\n\nOP are you letting your wife know how much you appreciate her? Are you making sure she gets health care as well as the child? Can you hire a babysitter so you guys can go out as a couple and talk when you\u2019re not so stressed out?\n\nNAH.", "Dammit I was gonna say that", "Very true. This topic is a good example with a highly upvoted ESH post. Yeah I guess the guy sucks for trying to get sleep before he wakes up at 4:30 to go drive a dozer or whatever.", "Postnatal women can develop postpartum psychosis and end up killing themselves and/ or their baby. They can also fall asleep when holding the baby or when bathing the baby and again, you have a dead child. These things are fortunately rare but they do happen so please don\u2019t say the only risk from a woman not sleeping is that she can become a bit cranky.", "My husband mentioned this just today actually.  How weird.", "I thought the same thing seeing these comments! I've shortened my \"requests\" to PANTS! at this point lol.", "Same!!", "The problem is the way OP is stating it. Like he cannot do any nighttime feedings.\n\nIf you have ever had a unsettled newborn, you know that they wake up every hour and a half to feed, which is not enough for the mother to get any rem sleep.\n\nThis wasn't as big of an issue in previous generations because women would simply sleep in the bed with their kids, and the kids could feed when the mother slept.\n\nWhat has changed is that many kids literally died from being laid on, and childhood mortality was higher.\n\nI will say though that if OP doesn't help though, the wife will certainly sleep in bed with the kid, putting the kids life at risk. Sleep deprivation changes your risk posture majorly.\n\nLong story short, not helping does risk lives.. just his baby's and not his.\n\nInstead of saying what he can't do, OP should focus on what he *can* do, like feeding the kid at 4am. Or giving the wife a 5 hour break from the kid so she can sleep after work.\n\nNewborn's can suck, and it's hard, but it doesn't last that long, and they are worth it. Don't put the burden on one person."]}
