I'm a (M34) and my wife is (F32). We've been married for 6 fantastic years and we recently had our first child, a beautiful girl who's now 6 weeks old. Things have been tumultuous lately, and I'm not sure if I'm the one being unreasonable.\n\nI work a physically demanding job in construction that starts at 6 a.m. This means I have to wake up at 4:30 a.m. to get ready and commute. My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents. My wife is on a year-long maternity leave and has the responsibility of caring for our baby throughout the day.\n\nHere's the problem. Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night. My wife has been insisting that I help with these late-night feedings and changes, but I've explained to her that a lack of sleep could seriously jeopardize my performance at work and my own safety.\n\nTo add more drama into the mix, my mother-in-law has moved in with us to \"help\" with the baby. However, her idea of help often involves criticizing my wife's parenting, which only adds to her stress, and dictating how we should run our household. She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.\n\nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.\n\nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother. I feel bad, but I also think that the current situation isn't sustainable.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to assist with our newborn at night due to the nature of my job, and for asking my intrusive MIL to leave?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: \n\nI should also mention that I have two stepsons from my wife's previous relationship. In addition to my work and the baby duties, I also pick them up from school, help with their homework, and take them to their sports practices after I get off work. It's not just about the newborn; we have a whole family to take care of. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m lounging around sipping a beer post-work.

If she took the baby for 2-3 hours during the day so mom could sleep, mom could handle the nighttimes better. You all three need to sit down and work out a plan so that you all get enough sleep. There are 3 of you and one baby - make a plan. When baby is asleep - mom is asleep if she's breastfeeding. This won't last forever. Even if you got up 15 minutes early to change the baby then take it to your wife to feed her, it would probably help.", "Info: Nothing is ever is so cut and dry. You should be able to find some compromise. You give some and get some. What time are you back from work? What your schedule look like, hour by hour? What does your wife's look like? Include sleeping hours as well.", "I\u2019ve been married for 28 years, two kids, 25 and 15. My husband also worked construction during the younger years and we ran our own construction business as they got older. Having a newborn is hard. It takes everything out of you and can be extremely stressful. I always took it upon myself to be sure and be up with the baby during the night so that he was able to sleep and be ready for those early morning work hours. When he came home he helped me with the babies and if I needed it, I took a nap while he did that. I stayed home and I did as much as I could to make things easier for him as he worked a high stress, physically demanding job outside the home. But we always made sure that each of our needs was being met and communicated with each other. This is the key. What are your needs? What are your limits? What do each of you expect from each other. Being tired after a baby clouds everything and can be super emotional for everyone, but especially the mom. It would help if you guys can talk this out and lay out your terms so to speak. Get a schedule and stick to it so that you both are comfortable and feel heard. The mother issue is a whole other thing. Sometimes it can be helpful and sometimes a for real nightmare. I wish you guys the best. I guess my judgement is everyone needs to be open and have more grace for each other during this time.", "I N F O- Does your MIL truly only criticize your parenting style or did she help out around the house and with the baby?

It sounds like there\u2019s a big lack in communication over who should be responsible for what parenting duties. It sounds like MIL could pitch in more with the older two kids. It sounds like your wife isn\u2019t communicating what she\u2019s expecting from her mom and you.

Your concern with work is very valid, so you both need to assess the tradeoff. maybe you call off on days you need to be up at night. maybe that's not an option so you hire a nanny or housekeeper so Wife can get some rest in the daytime. Maybe there are other parents in the neighborhood that are willing to pool resources or services to support each other. Maybe you take some housework when you get back from work. Maybe none of these solutions work for you, but my point is that you and your wife are a team, and should be working together to make sure your needs are met.\n\nYour feelings about MIL are valid, how does Wife feel about her? If you both feel shes doing more harm that good, then work together to resolve that. If Wife finds value in MIL's presence, maybe you let it go.", "YTA.\n\nFWIW I\u2019ve raised 4 children with my husband. Whenever there was a newborn involved, my husband said he\u2019d rather he shared the nights/feeds and was a bit tired at work, than have me caring for children or driving etc in extreme sleep deprivation with all the children in the car. He\u2019d rather literally any other outcome than burying his entire family if I fell asleep at the wheel trying to get children to school and constant medical appointments etc etc. Or had an accident at home, or got lost in the nightmare of post-natal depression. He\u2019d rather risk losing anything or anyone else. Because nothing would be as bad as losing us.\n\nSo we took turns, and we both got a full night of rest every second night. So no one was severely sleep deprived. In that system if you have one rough night with a baby you can function ok and you\u2019ll get rest the next night. But you\u2019re letting your wife shoulder severe sleep deprivation alone every single night without any relief, and that is a dangerous game that you\u2019re drastically underestimating. You\u2019re undervaluing her life, her worth and her responsibilities to other dependent lives.\n\nAnd then you removed the only support she had. Wow.

My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents.

Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night. My wife has been insisting that I help with these late-night feedings and changes, but I've explained to her that a lack of sleep could seriously jeopardize my performance at work and my own safety.  \nTo add more drama into the mix, my mother-in-law has moved in with us to \"help\" with the baby. However, her idea of help often involves criticizing my wife's parenting, which only adds to her stress, and dictating how we should run our household. She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.  \nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.  \nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother. I feel bad, but I also think that the current situation isn't sustainable.  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to assist with our newborn at night due to the nature of my job, and for asking my intrusive MIL to leave?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

According to my own mother I stopped taking naps at 9 months old and 30 years later the trend still holds. I *had* to have help at night or I was going to lose my mind. Thankfully my husband could help at that time.

All it really does is show your complete lack of empathy, understanding, and education on birth, medical recovery, childcare, child raising, newborns, health issues, complications, age related factors, financial factors, and general science backed facts about post-partum people. You should sit down before you show your ass anymore than you already have.", "Wow I wish I had someone to come and cook and clean for me all day like you do. I\u2019m not that privileged though.", "No wonder you're so fucking bitter after years of broken sleep. Some dad's actually step up and act like a parent too, sorry your husband was shit and you had to suffer.", "Unless the baby's being breasted, then the bulk of the work has to be on the mother anyway.", "It's not \"natural\" for a newborn to sleep away from their parent, my God are you condescending. They want to be cudlded/held.\n\nI'm glad your baby was such a good napper, but unless mine is on my chest or in my arms during the day, the longest she'll go in the bassinet is 10-30mins. Even if I neglected all the household chores and tried to sleep when she does, I cannot unwind and/or get any rest before she's ready to go again.", "I got o the point where I was so exhausted from having a crappy sleeper that I started to not be able to fall asleep because there didn\u2019t seem to be a point since she was just going to wake me up anyway. I couldn\u2019t nap, sleep at night, nothing, because the anxiety of it was crippling. It took a massive meltdown to get help, but I too wondered if a hospital grade injury would be worth it to get some sleep.", "women die and deal with life altering medical issues all the time from childbirth and post-partum complications. no one seems too concerned about that though.", "Nuh- UHHHH!", "Does that matter? Sometimes people don\u2019t have the option to turn down overtime. A lot of bosses don\u2019t look kindly upon that, like it\u2019s poor work ethic or some nonsense (heaven forbid there\u2019s work life balance). There are months my husband works OT every Saturday for months, and then there are months at a time that go by without an hour of OT. It\u2019s the nature of the construction business.", "That's why MIL should have stepped up and taken a night shift ,that's the whole point of helping out. Let's be real, no new parent cares about the house but every new parent will pay in gold for a few hours of sleep", "Wife can choose not to go to the store if she's too tired to safely drive. OP cannot choose to not work when he's too tired. This is not a reasonable comparison.", "Then her mom can drive. OP however doesn't have that luxury.", "But that\u2019s why MIL is supposedly there, to help for when wife is so tired she might drop the baby and OP isn\u2019t available.", "Ok, not ANYONE.  There are some exceptions, as you prove.  But many/most.  And I am an ally to men and dads.  Why not?  We need them too.  Why does everything need to be us vs them?", "Lol, ladies, I think we\u2019re upsetting the Reddit status quo.  Look at all the downvotes we\u2019re getting by daring to suggest that husbands shouldn\u2019t have to kiss our butts 24/7 \ud83d\ude06. I don\u2019t think most people on here have ever been in an actual functional relationship.", "Mine weren\u2019t great nappers.  I could set them down long enough to get something done though, so that when they DID nap, I could rest too.  And it IS recommended that they not nap WITH parents.  That\u2019s unsafe.  I\u2019m not condescending.  I\u2019m practical.  New parenthood isn\u2019t a disability and many of you are acting like it is.", "That doesn\u2019t happen from one or two nights. One or two nights with little to no sleep could kill someone if the person who\u2019s sleep deprived is operating heavy machinery or doing something that requires a lot of attention and care. They need to figure something else out.", "Because nothing about this post would lead to that analysis from a rational human being. It sounds like OP gives his wife plenty of support and she gets to rest when he gets home, so as the person who could accidentally maim and/or kill himself or someone else thereby permanently harming not only his family but also others, he requires his sleep. Sleep is not optional. You can\u2019t back up your initial terrible point by changing the scenario to what OP never said in the first place. BY THE POST, his sleep and thus life and limb is at risk. You\u2019re just reaching and it has nothing to do with this post.", "Are TOOOOOOOO. Imma tell my momma on you!", "There is also industries that require mandatory OT. My career, we have a call list. Short staffing is so bad that we literally draw straws on being mandated to stay, and work down a list on our days off. It sucks, but my girlfriend knew this before we got together. \n\nI would assume that the OP has had this job for a while, and his wife should know the financial situation/ work demands of her husband well before the baby came along.", "Too bad OP is asking whether he\u2019s the asshole for kicking his MIL out instead of asking whether he\u2019s the asshole for asking her to take the night shift", ">kiss our butts 24/7\n\nI'm so sorry that you've been brainwashed to think a father being a father is kissing ass.", "We found a balance that worked for us. Just because my husband didn\u2019t do night feedings most of the time doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t do his part the rest of the time. Then again, I never felt overly exhausted and overwhelmed by having newborns and since he traveled for weeks at a time with his job, needed to figure out a way to manage. But on Reddit, it\u2019s women need 24/7 assistance for months on end, otherwise their husbands are deadbeats. After 30 years of marriage and now with 2 adult children, I think we did good.", "You are condescending; if we co-slept with our babies, then we *would* be able to sleep when the baby sleeps, and this whole conversation would be moot. Babies sleep for hours when attached to a parent, it would be bliss.\n\nFact of the matter is, most newborns sleep best when held. Since we can't hold them and sleep at the same time, we're up a lot in those early weeks. \n\nYou even use the term \"rest\" when baby naps, not \"sleep\" when baby naps, so you know that most adults cannot follow a newborn sleep schedule.", "I\u2019m not brainwashed.  I have an amazing husband who would\u2019ve gotten up in the nights if I\u2019d asked him to.  I didn\u2019t ask, because I care as much about his well-being as my own, and he contributes in so many other ways (as it appears, so does OP).", "30 years! Congrats \ud83d\ude0a 12 here, but doing great. It\u2019s definitely all about finding the balance.", "Super lazy?? Did you even read the whole post?  OP does basically everything around the house EXCEPT overnight and daytime infant care.  When he\u2019s home and awake, he cares for the baby. He cares for his wife\u2019s two older boys. He does most of the cooking and cleaning.  This man is doing more than many."]}
