If she took the baby for 2-3 hours during the day so mom could sleep, mom could handle the nighttimes better. You all three need to sit down and work out a plan so that you all get enough sleep. There are 3 of you and one baby - make a plan. When baby is asleep - mom is asleep if she's breastfeeding. This won't last forever. Even if you got up 15 minutes early to change the baby then take it to your wife to feed her, it would probably help.", "Info: Nothing is ever is so cut and dry. You should be able to find some compromise. You give some and get some. What time are you back from work? What your schedule look like, hour by hour? What does your wife's look like? Include sleeping hours as well.", "I\u2019ve been married for 28 years, two kids, 25 and 15. My husband also worked construction during the younger years and we ran our own construction business as they got older. Having a newborn is hard. It takes everything out of you and can be extremely stressful. I always took it upon myself to be sure and be up with the baby during the night so that he was able to sleep and be ready for those early morning work hours. When he came home he helped me with the babies and if I needed it, I took a nap while he did that. I stayed home and I did as much as I could to make things easier for him as he worked a high stress, physically demanding job outside the home. But we always made sure that each of our needs was being met and communicated with each other. This is the key. What are your needs? What are your limits? What do each of you expect from each other. Being tired after a baby clouds everything and can be super emotional for everyone, but especially the mom. It would help if you guys can talk this out and lay out your terms so to speak. Get a schedule and stick to it so that you both are comfortable and feel heard. The mother issue is a whole other thing. Sometimes it can be helpful and sometimes a for real nightmare. I wish you guys the best. I guess my judgement is everyone needs to be open and have more grace for each other during this time.", "INFO- Does your MIL truly only criticize your parenting style or did she help out around the house and with the baby?

Your concern with work is very valid, so you both need to assess the tradeoff. maybe you call off on days you need to be up at night. maybe that's not an option so you hire a nanny or housekeeper so Wife can get some rest in the daytime. Maybe there are other parents in the neighborhood that are willing to pool resources or services to support each other. Maybe you take some housework when you get back from work. Maybe none of these solutions work for you, but my point is that you and your wife are a team, and should be working together to make sure your needs are met.\n\nYour feelings about MIL are valid, how does Wife feel about her? If you both feel shes doing more harm that good, then work together to resolve that.

Whenever there was a newborn involved, my husband said he\u2019d rather he shared the nights/feeds and was over-tired at work, than have me caring for children or driving etc in extreme sleep deprivation with all the children in the car. He\u2019d rather literally any other outcome than burying his entire family if I fell asleep at the wheel trying to get children to school and constant medical appointments etc etc. Or had an accident at home, or got lost in the nightmare of post-natal depression. He\u2019d rather risk losing anything or anyone else. Because nothing would be as bad as losing us.\n\nSo we took turns, and we both got a full night of rest every second night.

My job needs me to be alert, as any lapse could lead to serious accidents.

Our newborn, as they do, wakes up several times throughout the night.

She\u2019s also been siding with my wife on the nighttime assistance issue, making me feel ganged-up on in my own home.  \nI help as much as I can when I'm off work - I take on most of the cooking, cleaning, and tend to the baby as soon as I'm home till she sleeps. But the continuous pressure and lack of sleep are becoming unbearable.  \nAfter a particularly heated argument, I told my MIL that if she wasn\u2019t going to contribute positively, she\u2019d need to find somewhere else to stay. My wife was upset, saying I was out of line for kicking out her mother.
