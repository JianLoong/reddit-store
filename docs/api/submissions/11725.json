I feel very fortunate to have been able to purchase a home with multiple extra bedrooms. It's the exact layout I wanted because I always want it to be open to guests. \n\nFriends are a hugely important part of my life, and I think that was influenced by my parents. My childhood home was the hangout spot in our neighborhood and operated on an 'open door policy,' meaning my friends had free reign to come and go as they pleased. We lived in a really nice gated neighborhood, so there was no fear of anything bad happening. I loved it. It didn't matter if it was a school night or not - as long as everyone was well behaved and followed rules, we were good. It has resulted in lifelong friendships and lots of families who have claimed me as their 'bonus son,' along with my family doing the same to my friends. This continued into our teenage years. \n\nIt's something I've kept up even now that I have lived in places of my own. If I don't already live with my closest friends, then they have keys that they can use to stop by whether I'm home or not. I know this would be some people's worst nightmare but these are the people I'm closest to in my life. There's no pressure for me to impress them or suddenly become a perfect host when they show up, it's super casual. The people who have had keys to my previous apartments and now my home include 4 people - Dean, Adam, Rowan, and his little brother Matthew.\n\nMy girlfriend (26f) has known about this since back when we were friends before dating was ever on the table and has experienced friends of mine dropping by. Now that we're in a relationship, I told her about my love for opening my home to my friends this way, and that I'd like to keep it up for as long as possible before I had children and let their friends do the same.\n\nWe have recently begun discussing moving in together. However, conversations were halted last night after she mentioned getting the keys to my place back from the four mentioned above. I asked her what she meant, and she said there was no way she was going to have 'randoms' dropping by where she lived. I was hurt by this. These people are not 'randoms.' I've known Rowan in particular since we were 14 and his little brother since he was single digits. I told her this and said if she ever wanted to live with me, she would have to accept those terms. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678217002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l8k1b/aita_for_giving_out_keys_to_my_home_despite_my/", "score": 257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel maybe try to come to some sort of happy medium that works well with both of you", "I am a huge introvert, I would hate your open door policy, but that's why I wouldn't date and live with someone who was, because I wouldn't want them to change a huge part of themselves that is not a bad quality, just a different one, so... NTA because your girlfriend knew you long before getting together with you, she knew you like having loved ones have open access to your home \"mi casa es su casa\" but still pursued the relationship and now expects you to change a huge part of your lifestyle, this is a incompatible living situation, this could hinder future relationships because your partner may not feel comfortable being seen with bed hair and scruffy house clothes like you might be, also if they move in, will their friends have the same policy? Or is it always going to be your house they are living in with your rules?\n\nEDIT: ask yourself a few other questions, would you be ok with your partner walking around half naked/in a towel in the comfort of your shared home together while your friends pop in and out the house? Would you expect her to cover instantly for yours and your friends comfort/convenience? Would you be ok with coming home to finding your partner has gotten close with your friends and they hang out alone when you are not there? And again the questions I asked before said edit.", "NAH technically. You know your friends well and are comfortable with them coming over whenever without no warning.\nThe reality is that many people would not be. Some people don't like people to see their house messy. Messy varies from person to person. Some people would like to dress down at home and if anyone can walk in at anytime you can't. People aren't always up for guests even if they don't have to entertain them. You know your friends well doesn't mean your GF is comfortable being alone with them. \nI own my place and I still tell my partner and roommate that people are coming over and if they say \"no\" after a discussion the answer might be \"no not today\" to the person who wanted to visit. \nI can very easily see it being tiring never knowing who is coming by, when, how long their going to stay. Especially when you have no say on if they are there or not. \n\nI don't think this is about you and your GF being incompatible because this could easily be an issue with anyone that you dated not specifically her.", "YTA for refusing to compromise \n\nYou are free to do what you like as long as you live alone.\n\nShe is completely valid and reasonable for not wanting four men to have keys to her home. Even if they were her very best friends, it\u2019s totally reasonable to not want to be dropped in on unexpectedly.\n\nI am the designated host of my friend group and would be absolutely not happy if people regularly dropped by unexpectedly.\n\nRealistically you need to choose between this open door policy or having a partner, as very few people would feel how you feel about giving out keys to your home. It is one thing to want to be the designated hang out spot; and another entirely for people to drop in whenever they please, and a whole other level for them to actually have keys to come even when you are not home.\n\nA reasonable compromise would be for you to get the keys back, and agree on when she is happy to have \u201cdrop in hours.\u201d Ex: it\u2019s cool if people drop in between x-x time on x-x days, but other times they need to call ahead. If this sounds unreasonable to you, then I think you need to be prepared to live alone.\n\nYou\u2019ve also mentioned that she does not know these people well and some she even dislikes, so why on earth would she be comfortable with them having unfettered access to her home?", "Nta. It's your house now, it's your house after she moves in.  The terms are set before she moved in. She can keep them. Or you can stay in separate houses forever", "NAH\nBut I can totally see her ending it over this.  Because I don't k ow many women who would be comfortable with this.  Their would be a lack of feeling safe.", "NAH. But understand, this means you two probably won't be able to live together like, ever.", "NAH. Both your perspectives are valid. Even knowing and loving that about you, I can understand why she would not be comfortable (saying, stepping out of the shower) with people (even friends) unexpectedly showing up in her living space. To me, this feels like something that works well for you but simply doesn't work for her. I hope you can understand why to her it may feel like a potential safety / privacy issue, and that you having four (male) friends around is very different than her having guys around that she is NOT as close to.   \n\n\nWhen you take a big step in an adult relationship, it does mean being willing to honor the needs and preferences of your partner to some extent, and in that vein it really seems like there should be a compromise here, like that they keep the keys but give you and our GF the courtesy of a heads up (that one of your responds to) before they pop in. Or that you change your standards for the drop-ins but establish other practices that enable somewhat of an open-door policy, like a standard schedule of open door Fridays. Only you two can know how much you're able to meet in the middle.", "NAH. I am like you and prefer to have an open door policy with the people I\u2019m closest to- I\u2019m not a very private person and enjoy always having people around. It is understandable for her to be uncomfortable with this though. Is there room for compromise though? Could she have her own room in the house with a lock on the door that only she (and maybe you) have a key for? This might help give her the sense of security and privacy that she needs in a home. Would she be allowed to also have an open door policy with the people she is closest to?", "YTA, very few women are going to be comfortable with men they don\u2019t personally know and trust having unfettered access to their home. You can tell her you trust them, but when she\u2019s home alone in the shower, how can she really know she\u2019s safe? \n\nIt\u2019s nice to be as open as you are but you have really got to consider that you grew up (no offense intended I swear) in a very sheltered environment and most people are not going to be comfortable with what they have grown up being taught is a very dangerous practice.\n\nI had a similar problem while living with some family - literal interventions over forgetting to lock the garage door - I couldn\u2019t understand why it was so big of a deal. You\u2019re supposed to feel safe at home and honestly, not being able to keep your door locked is a huge leap of trust, one that many people who grew up in different, less safe environments may never be able to make. And to top that off, it\u2019s about ease of access for you, but much bigger for them. Your request makes her feel unsafe in her home. Her request makes it a little more of a hassle to open the door for guests.", "I mean if you are asking if you are the asshole for already giving out keys then NAH, sounds like it is your own home and your own call. however moving forward you may need to either compromise or end the relationship. Her desire to not have multiple people have keys and stop by whenever they want is completely rational, and you can't just force her to be ok with it. She has not known these people all her life like you have, and it likely feels unsafe or just uncomfortable to her. Don't you want her to feel safe and comfortable in her own home? The fact of the matter is that when you live with someone else you have to make compromises so everyone is comfortable, and just putting your foot down and calling it a non negotiable isn't really fair or helpful and kinda assholey imo.", "N T A for giving out keys when you lived by yourself.\n\nN A H for each of you having different views or being incompatible in this matter.\n\nYTA for not seeing her point. Having all people living in a place agree on who has a spare key - and when they are allowed to use it - is a matter of both comfort **and** safety. It\u2019s a two-yes one-no situation, and you\u2019re a little bit TA for not realizing that.", "NTA as you solely own the home.\n\nHowever, if you and your girlfriend were to marry and buy a house together and you continue to insist on this \u201copen door\u201d policy, then you would be the AH.\n\nYou might not mind people coming and going and arriving unannounced, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that your girlfriend would.\n\nIn fact, most people would.\n\nI have close family and friends that I love and a few have keys to my partner\u2019s and I\u2019s house in case of an emergency.\n\nHowever, none of those friends or family would ever dream of just stopping by on a random Tuesday evening and letting themselves in to sit on the couch.\n\nThere needs to be boundaries and the expectation of privacy in any shared home.\n\nIf you both are unwilling to compromise on this, time to find a new relationship.", "Yta no woman wants that for reasons mentioned below in other answers like what she wants to have sex outside the bedroom with you and what if like other comments have said she's in an emotional state and she wants to cry on the couch and not be around people other than her partner and you just said the people you're closest to so that means your fiance isn't the one closest to you I guess your fiance should be put first", "INFO: How well does your gf know these friends currently? Is there a possibility she would be more open to it if she got to know and trust them better?", "Soft YTA.\n\nI get wanting the house where everyone congregates, and especially when you've got kids I think it's understandable.\n\nAnd, I understand that when two people take the next big step in their relationship to cohabitate, there's a desire for that to feel special and private and a bit... insulated. She wants to nest and have some time where the two of you focus on each other and the life you're building, without a constant revolving door. She should be able to, for example, walk around naked in her own home at 4pm on a Tuesday without worrying about being interrupted. Remember, if you live together your intimate time is no longer structured around \"hey, want to come to my place tonight?\" so you might actually enjoy knowing you're not going to be walked in on at any moment.\n\nA compromise might look like asking your friends to call before coming over, or to reserve their keys for use in an emergency. If you live together, you don't really get to pull the \"my house, my rules\" card; it'll be her home too regardless of whose name is on the mortgage.", "NAH. It's your house and your prerogative at this point - but I also don't blame your gf if this was a deal breaker. I would not be able to live in a home where I had no expectation of privacy or warning before guests come over.", "NAH - I get that you are used to living your life like that and it\u2019s totally understandable based off your description of your upbringing. However, it\u2019s also perfectly reasonable for your gf to want a little more privacy than this current situation would allow. No AH here, you both have valid points of view and it sounds like someone is going to have to compromise to make it work", "NAH you have the right to do what you want but you also can't be mad at her for the way she feels about it. It would certainly make me nervous. As a landlord I tell tenants that it is not your friends who will rip you off but the people they may bring with them. As long as the policy is friends only then it's probably ok but I understand where she is coming from.", "NAH. This is how you have lived your life, but is not how she and lived hers and she is not comfortable with having people able to stop when literally whenever. It may just be a fundamental incompatibility because I would absolutely die inside if I was forced to accommodate people randomly stopping into my house.", "NTA I think maybe you should pause on moving in together. Maybe she doesn\u2019t know them all well enough to feel comfortable having them just walk in. I feel like you should both be on the same page though before or not so anything that\u2019s going to cause discomfort on either side. \n\nI\u2019m bias because that\u2019s what it was like at my home growing up and I have keys to my friends home too even now as adults where I can just come by.  Not everyone is as lucky to have that kind of friendship or can understand that level of trust. \n\nI don\u2019t blame her if she doesn\u2019t know them or is uncomfortable around them as maybe they\u2019re not her friends and if she does move in notice will need to be given to be courteous as she has a right to be comfortable in her own home too and you can\u2019t always be seen as you are at home by company.", "NAH, but idk how you\u2019ll feel when she\u2019s walking around in her underwear and one of your close friends walks in. She lives there and should feel comfortable.", "NAH, everyone has the right to the home environment they want. And you\u2019re just not compatible to cohabitate. \n\nAnd although it\u2019s NAH,  if I were her, I would absolutely not move in.

As a female the first thing I do when I walk in the door is take my bra off. I would hate being in my own home and unable to relax in the event that someone might drop by. I love my family but nobody has a key to our house but that was mutually agreed on by me and my husband. I get that this is how it\u2019s been for you but part of having a partner is compromise. Would it be so bad to restrict these drop ins to certain days only or if that doesn\u2019t work at least a courtesy text beforehand. You grew up with these people, she did not so it\u2019s totally understandable that she\u2019s not going to have the same comfort level as you. Just as I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable giving out an additional 4 keys to friends of hers.", "You laid out what your terms are, now you have to be ok with her either accepting or rejecting them. \n\nSeems like there\u2019s no AH here.

This policy while you're living alone is fine, but as you grow up and move forward in life with a partner things change.

We do not walk in and out of one another's house unannounced.", "Strong NTA\n\nYour girlfriend is not really all that wrong though either\n\nI have almost never heard of 5 bros having each other's keys\n\nIts more about you neotiating the best deal with her and explain why your friends are important, maybe introduce both parties? You arent wrong, but your situation is unusual, explain it", "NAH- but if you want to salvage the relationship, you guys should sit down and discuss whether a compromise can be reached. These could include:\n\n1. Friends giving both of you guys a heads up when they\u2019re coming over, AND your gf having the discretion to say \u2018it\u2019s not a good time, come over at x time instead.\u2019 \n\n2. Visiting hours- the house can be considered \u2018open\u2019 during certain hours, you enforce this boundary with your friends and your S/O gets privacy the rest of the day. \n\n3. Private spaces in the house- perhaps the upstairs is off limits to friends unless they\u2019re staying the night for some reason - it\u2019s not unreasonable to want/need a private space. \n\n4. Perhaps your S/O has people she would like to initiate into this policy- maybe she has a best friend who could benefit from the open door policy. \n\nThese are just off the top of my head, but have a discussion with her, try to validate her feelings and also explain that your feelings need to be validated too.", "NTA. you home, your rules. GF doesn't like, she doesn't have to live with you. she doesn't get to come into YOUR home and demand rules.", "It's your house and you can give access to whomever you wish.\n\nHowever if she is going to live there, it's not unreasonable for her to want security/privacy.\n\nNAH", "NAH\n\n\nYou're allowed to have your terms for your home. She is as well. You don't have to agree as long as you continue to live separately.  You should consider where your relationship is going to go and if you're compatible.", "NAH, but this will probably be the end of the relationship. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with your home being the hangout spot for your friends. You are well within your right to invite anyone into your home whenever you see fit. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with your girlfriend wanting privacy in her home. She is well within her right to want boundaries for when and how often people are in her home. \n\nYou can love each other but not be compatible. This sounds like you are unlikely to be on the same page with this. \n\nEither of you would become the asshole if one of you tried to force the other to do what they wanted here.

You're not forcing her to move in, but she's forcing you to change your lifestyle. \n\n\nSounds like this isn't a good match unless she's okay living apart until you're married (thats assuming you're going to stick to what you said about changing who has keys)", "YTA. I\u2019m not quite sure if you get it but as a woman this would make me so uncomfortable. I\u2019m thinking the relationship you have with your friends is super lovely and I\u2019ve had a similar thing with friends of my own. But, if you want to take things seriously with your girlfriend then time to set boundaries with your friends and move on with life, that doesn\u2019t mean cut them out but time for a new phase.

NTA. Personally I wouldn't do this but you bought the place, it's up to you.", "NAH.\n\nIt's an unfortunate reality that, generally speaking, women have different safety concerns than men. I can't think of any woman I have ever met who would feel safe living in the situation you describe.\n\nThat said, it is your house. As long as you are the only one living there, you can hand out keys to whomever you wish.\n\nCan you both handle not living together?", "from what I know, open door policy is leaving the door unlocked not giving out keys? like at that point there wouldn't be any point on locking the door at all...", "NTA. I wonder what else she expects/assumes you'll give up for her?", "NAH. I am similar to you with the open-door policy for people  close to me, so I totally understand where you're coming from. That said, I am also a woman, and understand feeling unsafe if there are people, especially men, who have free access to my home if I don't personally know and deeply trust them myself. It does sound pretty rude and hurtful of her to have called them \"randoms,\" but it also sounds like more open communication is needed. It wouldn't be fair for her to say there's no chance she would ever move in if anyone else had a key, and I don't think it's fair for you to demand she blindly accept the terms without fully hearing her out and trying to make some adjustments for her to feel safe during the transition period.\n\nIn more detail, I would make sure to:\n\n(1) have a full conversation about exactly why she's worried. Make sure you aren't making assumptions or overlooking any past experiences that have made her feel unsafe in her home. These do not necessarily need to be past incidents with these particular individuals, though that would be especially important to know, but any past experiences. Patiently try to get a clear picture of where she's coming from. I hope she is mature, patient, and communicative enough to be able to do this with you and that you are also mature, patient, and communicative enough to listen.\n\n(2) give her more time to get to know all four of them before having her move in with you. These three friends + kid have been an extremely important part of your life, long before she was, so I would not suddenly take change this part of your relationship with them for her. But it's possible a compromise may be helpful, at least during the transition period, until she can develop feelings of trust and safety with them on her own. During the transition period, I would consider asking them to kindly shoot her a text whenever they were planning to pop over. They could still have keys, but if they shot her a text every single time during the transition period, she would start to see for herself that they are reliable and willing to respect her space and wishes. After a time, you may not need to do this anymore once they feel like family to her too, but it is extremely understandable for her to feel wary of four males coming in and out of her safe space without being able to develop that trust on her own.\n\nOverall, more communication definitely seems necessary from both sides. NAH.\n\n**ETA: I just want to emphasize that if she ever tells you that any of these men have made her uncomfortable for ANY reason at ANY time, I would 100% expect that you respect that she feels this way with no questions asked. If you think you would be incapable of doing that for her, then YTA, and you shouldn't be together. If you ever want to live with anyone, you would have to respect that she has the right to feel completely safe and comfortable in her own home. If you will always need to prioritize your friends over any partner no matter what, then you should continue to live alone.**", "NAH technically, since it\u2019s your home.\n\nHowever, I would not move into a home where 4 random people could walk in and out as they wished, whenever they wanted to. I would never feel comfortable with that.\n\nIf this is the hill you want to die on, then go ahead. But you can\u2019t have your own house rules, ***and*** force her to move in and be okay with it. Its one or the other.", "NTA. Those friends were there first and they will be there long after she is gone. And I know she will be gone because she doesn\u2019t respect you, the home YOU OWN or your closest relationships.

NO ONE likes random pop ins...except you, lol. if you want her to live with you than you need to consider HER comfort too. I would NOT move in with you if at all if I knew that at any second some random friend will open the door and walk in. what if she needed something while she was in the shower or changing? I would be 100% paranoid and not comfortable at all in this situation.", "NTA your gf might not be right for you. She disrespected your lifestyle and assumed you\u2019d change your values for her.", "NAH.", "YTA she is a woman, she deserves privacy in her own home, imagine she is juat getting out of bath alone in home and a man she doesn't know is sitting on the couch. No, just no. I really wish she dumps you, no woman in their rigth mind would ever agree with something crazy like that.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think I see it on here in the comments, but a majority of women (SAH or not) feel a pressure when people come over, that their homes needs to look presentable.  I\u2019m sure your guy friends don\u2019t care, but if there were no time to do the morning dishes and the kitchen was messy, and she knew your friend popped in, she would feel insecure if what he thought of her.  \nOnce you get to a certain age the messy college apartment isn\u2019t cute & fun.\n\nHow could she feel comfortable walking around the house naked to grab a coffee after a shower knowing 4-10 people have keys and just pop over? \n\nHaving an open door policy is great, but with restrictions, you\u2019re always welcome, but call and give us a 30 minute heads up. \n\nOnce you have kids things will change. There will be no more walking around naked, kids have schedules so it\u2019s more predicable when kids will pop over. The house will be in constant chaos and you can blame the kids for the mess.", "NAH, but you do have to recognize that this is not a normal arrangement and most significant others would have a problem with it. Maybe suggest that your friends keep their keys but have to give several hours' notice before dropping by?", "A good compromise might be having a section of the house that requires a separate key. Like a bedroom/bathroom area so she can have privacy when people might just pop in", "NAH meaning she's not the ahole either.  She brought this up, as a grown adult, at an appropriate time (when you were discussing cohabitation).  \n\nYou're a dude which means, and I mean this as kindly as possible, you are not quite aware of what it's like to be female.

When they were all around 10-12 we actually had a huge 10 person tent we pitched each summer and the boys, and the girls took turns camping in our yard.  It was fun for them, and it kept them occupied.  My kids are the same way too.

I feel very fortunate to have been able to purchase a home with multiple extra bedrooms. It's the exact layout I wanted because I always want it to be open to guests. \n\nFriends are a hugely important part of my life, and I think that was influenced by my parents. My childhood home was the hangout spot in our neighborhood and operated on an 'open door policy,' meaning my friends had free reign to come and go as they pleased. We lived in a really nice gated neighborhood, so there was no fear of anything bad happening. I loved it. It didn't matter if it was a school night or not - as long as everyone was well behaved and followed rules, we were good. It has resulted in lifelong friendships and lots of families who have claimed me as their 'bonus son,' along with my family doing the same to my friends. This continued into our teenage years. \n\nIt's something I've kept up even now that I have lived in places of my own. If I don't already live with my closest friends, then they have keys that they can use to stop by whether I'm home or not. I know this would be some people's worst nightmare but these are the people I'm closest to in my life. There's no pressure for me to impress them or suddenly become a perfect host when they show up, it's super casual. The people who have had keys to my previous apartments and now my home include 4 people - Dean, Adam, Rowan, and his little brother Matthew.\n\nMy girlfriend (26f) has known about this since back when we were friends before dating was ever on the table and has experienced friends of mine dropping by. Now that we're in a relationship, I told her about my love for opening my home to my friends this way, and that I'd like to keep it up for as long as possible before I had children and let their friends do the same.\n\nWe have recently begun discussing moving in together. However, conversations were halted last night after she mentioned getting the keys to my place back from the four mentioned above. I asked her what she meant, and she said there was no way she was going to have 'randoms' dropping by where she lived. I was hurt by this. These people are not 'randoms.' I've known Rowan in particular since we were 14 and his little brother since he was single digits. I told her this and said if she ever wanted to live with me, she would have to accept those terms. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH - she shouldn\u2019t have assumed that you would ask the keys back, but it\u2019s good to see if you can both come to a compromise.

This and the two cameras (one is a furbo) in the living area make me feel more at ease. We both happened to own our own home in the same neighborhood, but I bought mine more recently and have not lived with anyone in mine. So he moved into my house. Clearly we both made compromises, but this made me feel more comfortable because I can walk around naked and not be terrified the front door will randomly open. I do see his mom more than I'd like, but I just lay low in another room when I don't feel like interacting or ask them to hang out at the pub down the road if I really want privacy.

That's just a very risky situation and one I'd probably advise any woman against. That means there are lots of keys to your place floating around so she really has no control over who comes in or who brings other people in. And there is a reality that the most likely person to sexually assault a woman is a friend or acquaintance. And she has no place to close off and not worry about someone coming in. She also has no control over if one of them comes in and hides a camera somewhere while you're both out. Yes you may trust these guys and that's great. But I don't know if you've found this in your life but I certainly have in mine, that men who are jerks and abusive in their relationships with women can often be perfectly nice to me and I'd just never know.

Yes, it\u2019s your house, but if her or any girlfriend moves in it becomes both of your homes. People have the right to expect privacy and quiet when they come home. I think a fair policy would be to get the keys back and tell your friends that they are welcome to stop by with advance notice during times/days you and your girlfriend agree upon, with the expectation that if your girlfriend has actual plans or other people coming over then your friends would need to find somewhere else to go. What happens when your girlfriend wants to have a couple of friends over for dinner and your friends just barge in? This way if your girlfriend has something else going on you can let your friends know not to come- she shouldn\u2019t have to make plans without knowing how many people to expect, or make enough food for extra people, etc. \n\nI have to say, having people- any people- constantly dropping by unannounced and just letting themselves in would be a dealbreaker for me.

Your girlfriend is not asking for anything unreasonable.", "NAH \nMaybe a compromise would be asking them to give a heads up before coming so girlfriend  isn't  going to be surprised by extra people walking in on her. \n\nOtherwise, along with everyone else, I'd say this might be the incompatibility that breaks the relationship.", "NAH. Neither of you are in the wrong - I just think she definitely should not move in with you / pursue this relationship if you are not comfortable with the boundaries she needs in her home life (and vice versa.)\n\nI personally am very uncomfortable with people dropping by unannounced and would be incredibly upset if they could just let themselves in.

Only one has a key for emergencies only.. In fact I changed the locks. This wasn't a slight to them but when you choose to live with an SO it becomes their home too. \n\nYour telling her that they are more important than her and she can never expect any privacy.

If she moves in with you it will be her home too even if you are technically the owner.  What if she is in the shower or changing or walking around in her bra while she gets ready does she always have to be prepared for an ambush?  What if you two are being intimate?  I think most adults want their own privacy and respect the privacy of their friends and family.  Your friends can text you and see if it's a good time before coming over, boundaries are healthy.  It's different when you were a teenager and having friends over, your parents already had some level of not having privacy in their home given teenage kids so friends coming in and out frankly would be less impactful than a young couple.  It's also a bit of codependence thing with you and your friends, it's healthy to move on from childhood and have mature relationships with your friends and make a deeper and lasting relationship with a partner.

When couples have different priorities like this, it's time to find a fair compromise halfway between them that can work for everyone, or else it's a sign of incompatibility. You are trying to completely dictate the situation rather than acknowledging her needs for privacy in her own home being equally important to her.

It's one thing to make your home a safe space for your kids and their young friends. It's another thing entirely to ask your partner in a relationship to accept other adults treating your home as a crash pad without any warning.\n\nOP expects to play by the rules he grew up with as a kid forever, but that's not how mature, mutually respectful adult relationships work. At some point, when you enter into serious romantic relationships and build a home together, different boundaries with your friends become appropropriate. It's fine to say that he wants to open his home to his children's friends when he has them . . . but for now, having his buddies treat his home as a free-for-all even as he is moving in with a girlfriend or potential future wife? Good luck with that.

I can see why she wouldn't want people she doesn't get along with to be able to enter and exit the home she lives in whenever they like.\n\nThis open-door policy sounds very pro-social and all, but there have to be limitations at some point\u2014as in, people at least asking if they can swing by, and being completely okay when the answer is \"no.\" If you want to form a household with your girlfriend, it has to be *both of your* household. Starting from a place of \"my house, my rules\" with the person you're trying to form a household with is just not going to lead to a healthy situation.", "INFO: If your girlfriend moves in, will you consider it to be her home as well? Because if it is also going to be her home, she should have a say about who has keys as well. \n\nIf you aren't even willing to compromise, I don't see this relationship lasting. Because what she is asking is completely reasonable if she is supposed to consider it her home as well.\n\nLook at this from her perspective for a second. She's a woman who has moved into a home, but she can't ever feel comfortable there because she has no idea when someone is just going to randomly let themself in her home. What if she's getting out of the shower and your bros just show up and let themselves in without warning?\n\nI don't know if this has ever occurred to you because you are a guy. But, women have been taught over and over again to do whatever it takes to keep themselves safe. Knowing when someone is coming to your home and having the ability to decide whether or not that person can enter, is a huge part of it. \n\nThis whole thing reminds me of a time my (at the time) boss made a joke about his wife keeping him on the phone while she was home with very small children and a repair man was there. I told him to think about it from her perspective. She is alone with very small children and there is a stranger in her house. \n\nI don't think men see just how much women have to do EVERY DAY to keep themselves from being victimized. So if you truly want her to feel that it is also her home, you really need to be willing to talk it out and compromise. Otherwise what is even the point of continuing the relationship?", "Someone I don't get along with being *in my home* is one of my worst nightmares.\n\nI guess NAH because you can do what you want, but it would be a deal breaker for me personally.

The challenge is she doesn\u2019t get along with your closest friends. Since if you move in, it will no longer be your space, as it will be jointly shared. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want someone who I don\u2019t get along with to have access to my home whenever they chose.", "Look you\u2019re not the AH yet as it\u2019s your house, but if you want this to be her home as well this isn\u2019t negotiable? \n\nYou have to understand you had a sheltered upbringing, that kids coming and going into other parents houses is vastly different to grown adults with keys to your place and many people wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with this and you be asking too much.", "There are 4 people with keys, other than you. And there are \"some that she doesn't get along with very well.\" So there's only 4, and some implies multiple, so at BEST she gets along with half. At worst, only one.

It doesn't.   He's asking her to go against a normal instinct that any normal mother would raise her daughter to have.    Gosh I hope this girl see's her comfort and safety isn't high on his list", "No \u2026 they are not compatible and he won\u2019t be compatible with any other woman either, based on his attitude. So he should not end the relationship. Instead he should engage in some self examination and think about how he needs to be willing to compromise, and how he can adjust things to ensure his girlfriend or wife is safe and comfortable in her own home, and also how he can continue to be welcoming to his friends (and her friends and family also). That likely does not entail multiple unrelated people having the keys to her home.", "This is my thought. I grew up similar to OP and to me, to the point one sibling's friend walked in one day (alone) to use our bathroom since it was common knowledge our door was always unlocked. It wouldn't be a safety concern (although totally valid for those who would feel like that) as just a privacy thing. Growing up, I didnt have the expectation of privacy anyways since it was a shared family home. Now that im on my own, I want to have the ability to walk-around half naked or shower with the door open, etc. Id be so uncomfortable if I ran into some friend unexpected because they let themselves in. Even the family members who do have access to my current place would never just show up unannounced. Either they are invited over or its a prearranged \"just drop it off while I'm at work\" kind of scenario. Theyd never use their keys to just show up without any sort of warning.", "This.

Immature boys are so exhausting.", "It also makes me wonder how OP sees this going now that he wants to live together.

I suppose I should have elaborated but what I meant is that they both need to compromise. \n\nI would say the best way is to have a semi open door approach where they need to give some kind of advance notice and not be allowed to just waltz in whenever. It would be up to them how long that notice needs to be. It could be as little as them having to ring the doorbell and wait for it to be answered just as long as it is enough to make her feel safe."]}
