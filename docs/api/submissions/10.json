We get along great and I thought we had a future.  \n\nShe got pregnant and we were kind of excited to start a family.  When the baby was born it was very obviously not mine.  I did not sign the birth certificate.  I also did not break up with her.  But I also told her that I would not be making myself financially responsible for the baby.  \n\nWe had planned for her to take a year off work to be with the baby.  She had already taken her maternity leave.  I said she needed to go after the father for child support.  She didn't want to because they were \"friends\". I said I understood but then she had to take full financial responsibility for the kid. I would help her with all the childrearing like changing diapers and feedings and the like but not for paying for any of it.  She agreed.  \n\nShe ran through her savings in about six months.  She talked to me about helping her with baby formula and stuff and I said no.  That isn't our agreement.  \n\nShe called him and asked for money and he gave her a few thousand dollars to pay for baby stuff but told her not to contact him again.  That is when she understood their \"friendship\".\n\nSo she went after him for child support.  His fiancee found out about the whole thing and is thinking of breaking things off.  The child support is enough that the baby will be well taken care of and will not affect our finances.  \n\nHe called her crying because we f'd up his life.  He said that I could easily afford to take care of them and that I'm an asshole for dragging his life through the mud. She feels terrible about it and blames me for not just stepping up and considering her a single mom.  \n\nI love my girlfriend and the baby and I have no problem raising the baby.  But I don't think I should be held financially responsible when the father has resources and tried to evade responsibility.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673699876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bnh8v/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_go_after_her_baby/", "score": 9561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sound very cold and removed, yet I understand your position. \n\nThis is where morals, ethics, and legality can muddy the waters. Are you obligated in any way to assist in financially contributing for this child? Of course not. However,  the fact that you were OK watching your girlfriend struggle and panic while she tried to figure it all out and wouldn't even buy the baby formula seems.....cold.  I would buy formula for a stranger to ensure their kid didn't go hungry. I certainly could not stand by and watch someone I love struggle and not help.\n\nYou claim you love your GF and the baby, but honestly,  I would take time to consider how this attitude could affect this baby later in life. Kids notice things. Someday this child will realize that while you say you love them,  you aren't willing to break your agreement and buy the kid McDonald's for dinner, or a bicycle, or new shoes or whatever.  This kid will be well aware that love from you is conditional at best.  That may not be the best choice for the child, or your girlfriend.", "100% NTA Honestly the fact that you stayed with her at all shows that you really care. I don't mean to dig, but did she pretend the baby was yours the whole time she was pregnant? Did you at least know it was an \"open\" relationship and the baby might not be yours from the start? Regardless that guy cheated on his fiance and deserves what he's got coming. Its not up to you to raise his kid. He should be thankful that you're willing to take that responsibility and pay whatever is needed. What happens 10 years down the line when he grows a conscience and wants partial custody? Are you still responsible for providing for the kid he has half of the time and dealing with the child calling another person dad? Your girlfriend should be shouting for joy that shes with the right person and not making you feel bad for her mistakes in getting pregnant with the wrong person.", "NTA he said not to contact him again.

I know you love her, but why? She's too chickenshit to go after her the rightful person for child support (the support that is legally owed to her child, not her).\n\nThen when the rightful person is confronted, they blame you for ruining their lives, instead of acknowledging fault and taking responsibility for their role in this. These are terrible people, who will cause a great deal of stress in your life. Why would you want to involve yourself in this messy situation when this all could be avoided by ending the relationship?\n\nEdit: Take a cue from the fiancee. She is willing to end the engagement and the relationship because if she goes through with it, the baby mama and the baby will be in her life forever. She is smart in wanting to leave because that is a lot of baggage to take on. Please reconsider involving yourself in this situation.", "ESH - Sure, father should be financially contributing but you are choosing to stick around.

Not your kid and bio father needs to be financially responsible.  Bigger issue here.  Have you and GF discussed agreements related to \"fluid bonding\" with other partners?  Functioning Open relationships usually have agreements about which partners one's lover does and does not use protection with.    This really helps with the whole \"Whose baby is this?\" problem.  Yes, protection fails, but you can game out more likely contingencies ahead of time and it will still go smoother.

But think hard about this person in your life:\n\nIt sounds like gf didn't inform bio-dad as soon as she knew it was his. She didn't put the needs of her child before her consideration of her 'friend'. She didn't have a realistic sense of what it would cost to raise a child and her ability to provide that. She had no problem inconveniencing you for more than you were already giving her.

I just have a hard time seeing how OP can carry this attitude forward in the relationship without negatively impacting the child.", "Maybe not an asshole but the whole situation is super weird.\n\nOP's GF gets knocked up by another guy and he's cool with it, but not really, and he loves the baby, but won't pay for it, and his girlfriend is great but she has to burn out her life savings to stay home with not-his-kid that he loves and it's baby's daddy's responsibility to pay for the kid OP is raising himself.\n\nOP does not come across as the worst person in the situation, by far, but it's still an odd response piled on top of other odd responses that add up to feeling...I don't know inconsistent?", ">I would help her with all the childrearing like changing diapers and feedings and the like but not for paying for any of it.  \n  \n  \n> I love my girlfriend and the baby and I have no problem raising the baby. But I don't think I should be held financially responsible when the father has resources and tried to evade responsibility.  \n  \n  \nThis is why.  Because he's treating a tiny little human being as if its something he can just pick and choose what parts he wants to be involved in and what parts he doesn't want to be involved in.  He loves the baby, he has no problem raising the baby (something a parent does) but he doesn't want the financial responsibility.  What is this halfass shit?  \nLook, either you're a parent to the child, you're stepping up and taking on that role, or you're fucking not.  This is a life, a little human being that will grow up to have feelings and not understand why 'daddy' won't pay for their clothes or why 'daddy' won't pay for them to be in sports in school or why 'daddy' won't do anything that requires money... not a toy that you can pick up and play with and just put down when you decide you're done.  \nIn the same way that parents who pay child support and take on the financial responsibility of a child, but refuse to have anything else to do with the child (ever come see them, do things with them, help with raising them) suck, parents who want to be in the child's life but not be financially responsible suck just as much.  \nI get that OP isn't the bio parent and technically, legally, the child is not his responsibility.  That makes this whole situation worse because he's not just shirking responsibility that should be his but he never wanted, he's making a choice to stay with this woman and making a choice to 'raise' this child and act like a parent in some ways but when it comes to the money not be a parent.  \nThat's not how any of this works.  \nMen - I don't know why any of y'all need to hear this, but... if you're with a woman who has a child from a previous relationship or another man and you're staying in that relationship... you have a choice to make.  Either you're a parent to that child (if mom is ok with it, and if the child is ok with it presuming they're old enough to have feelings on the matter), and you're accepting all aspects and responsibilities of parenthood, or you're fucking not.  That's not to say you can't have anything to do with the child... but you're mom's boyfriend, not dad.  You can talk to them or take them out with mom for dinner or whatever, be friendly like an uncle or something, but don't try to play daddy unless you're going to go all the way.  \n  \nDo, or do not.  There is no try.  \n  \nEdit: I should clarify OP is NTA for asking his GF to go after the baby daddy for child support - there's nothing inherently wrong with saying hey he should be helping pay for this child he helped create (unless both sides are ok with him signing away his parental rights and him never having a part in the child's life in any way, and OP adopting the child).  OP is TA for refusing to help in any way financially, while simultaneously trying to raise the child and be a daddy, just not a daddy when it costs money.  What happens when the child is 8 and mom's struggling financially and baby daddy isn't working or paying child support and mom can't afford food?  Is 'daddy' going to eat dinner while letting mom and the kid starve?  Is 'daddy' going to feed mom and eat dinner and tell the kid 'sorry little dude but its your bio father's job to help buy food for you, not mine'?", "Because imo he doesn't really understand what he's getting into, or thinking ahead. He wants to be a family with his girlfriend and her baby and be a father figure to him yet doesn't want to contribute financially. Which is completely fair, that's not his kid, but then how do you keep the two things separate? How can you be a father while also refusing to support the child financially? \n\nIt seems to me that OP wants to have his cake and eat it too and that he's causing more problems than he would have had he just walked away. This is not his baby, he has no obligation to take care of him financially, and from the post it seems he and the girlfriend haven't even been together for that long. It seems to me that his presence in this family is gonna cause more trouble for everyone involved than his absence would.", "He encouraged his girlfriend not to work and now she's run through her savings and has to ask for child support.

Having legally enforced support means that if he keeled over with a heart attack tomorrow the child still has the resources he's entitled too.  \n\nMama was making terrible decisions and one of those was not standing up for her rights, so OP forced the issue and once mama stood up for herself, then also stepped in himself.  \n\nSometimes you've gotta bring this stuff to a head and force your partner to find her courage and fight when she needs to, there's a lot of folks who will find any alternative to conflict if they think they have one, he was just removing that possibility until she'd actually take care of herself.", "OP basically says this in a comment.

Even if it's only with money. It sucks his life got ruined but it was by his own actions. He cheated. Sex almost always had a chance to make a child.

How is he going to properly parent if he sticks to this agreement for the kid's whole childhood? How can you emotionally see a kid as your child but still act like they are not your problem financially? That is not going to be sustainable in the long run.

Lmfao I don't know). Now that it turns out gf might not be able to get child support he has to choose, either he wants to be this kid's parent or not.\n\nIf he doesn't want to that's fair, but then leave now before the kid thinks of him as their father. It's not fair to this kid and gf to always have the threat of leaving hanging over their heads if they become too much of a financial burden for his liking.\n\nIf he does want to then he has to commit to it.", "Yes but at a certain point the emotional commitment requires a financial commitment as well. Play it out.. what if they stay together for 6 years and then break up. The kid is now 6 and the two parents he has always known and is bonded to live separately. He wants to see his dad and it is in his best interest to spend a reasonable amount of time at his home as well as his moms. Who pays for the kids clothes at that home, his toys, his furniture, food, activities, and so on. Does mom now have to pay double for everything so kid can stay at dads sometimes? She\u2019s not going to be able to do that as a single mother even with child support from bio-dad. So now what? The kid won\u2019t be spending time at dads home because he won\u2019t pay for him to live there? \n\nI understand where OP is coming from and actually it is in this kids best interest to know his bio-dad as well on top of the financial stuff, but like this argument from OP is non-sensical. When you step into a parenting role and a family role there are financial responsibilities. This is all tied together and you can\u2019t just pick and choose. If OP doesn\u2019t want that responsibility then just bow out now. \n\nAlso it doesn\u2019t sound like GF \u201clet him believe it was his\u201d. It sounds like they both thought or hoped it was his but knew it possibly wasn\u2019t. She\u2019s not making great choices nor involving bio-dad in my opinion and don\u2019t agree we should worry about him being upset, he needs to also take responsibility, but she\u2019s not like trying to pull one over on him. Seems like everyone was in kind of a hair situation and it could have been dealt with better all around. Also I do have a weird feeling about OP having her agree to this financial situation after she\u2019s just given birth, is probably additionally emotionally distraught finding out he\u2019s not the father, and like seemingly had no other options - like what\u2019s she gonna do say no?", "Let's be clear here.\n\nShe didn't \"let him believe\" shit. He was as aware of the fact that they weren't exclusive, as she was. They both had access to the same information from the very beginning.\n\nThe OP stated very clearly that they weren't exclusive. That means that nobody was cheating, lying, or sneaking around, and nobody was betrayed.\n\nWhen she told him she was pregnant, he chose to stay and have a child with her. He chose to be a dad with all of the information about who the biological father was that she had. He wasn't tricked or trapped, and nobody was malicious in their dealings. He told her that he would step up and be the father to the baby they were going to have together, and then he also told her that he would provide for their new family financially.\n\nThen when the baby was born he took on all of the responsibilities of being a father, except that he also decided to punish *his* baby and the mother of his baby for something neither of them did *to* him. \n\nFinally, he insisted that the only substitution in this punishment would have to be a person who, again, did absolutely nothing to harm him except essentially win a coin toss that nobody knew they were participating in.", "He also said in a comment that he is fine paying for the kid now and putting the child support in an account, but that if she had asked the bio dad for support and he said no and for whatever reason she didn\u2019t get it, he would break up with her???

I would not be in a relationship with someone who tell me that they'll act like my baby's father, unless there's any kind of money required. You're either going to be the father or you won't. Fair enough if your choice is that you don't want to be a parent, but this half way through bullshit is not good for anyone. What if the bio father dies?", "You need to end the relationship anyway.", "This relationship is doomed", "I agree with the poster who said you should switch that, so the child support goes to the child\u2019s needs, and then you can put your money towards the future account.  As per your concerns about being held legally liable because you acted as a provider.", "Aaaaah I see! And then when your gf goes back to work you will both contribute and the child support for the most part can go into savings. \n\nI think what you did was the smartest thing and any \u201cruin\u201d to the bio dad\u2019s life is his own fault for telling your gf not to contact him again instead of helping out. It sounds like you are ok with helping out, but you did not want to do so until/unless there was child support so you would not get pinned with HIS responsibilities if you and your gf don\u2019t work out.

You have done NOTHING wrong.", "You are helping hold a father responsible for his offspring.   That\u2019s it.   Keep it up.  \n\nTo me, that she would want to protect the father is silly.

I'm not sure if many people would stay with a gf that got pregnant by another man while you were dating her, seems OP is being more then generous.", "Right, this was my reading of the situation, if she continued to refuse to get biodad to step up financially then the relationship would be over because she is choosing not to make biodad uncomfortable and put the responsibility on OP.\n\nOP drew a boundary of biodad has to have some responsibility if you want me to stay, the excuse of he is her friend, it is uncomfortable, it is embarrassing whatever means she is putting her friends feelings over his, and that is a relationship killer as well.\n\nIf bio father dies the child will be eligible for SSI survivor benefits", "Every man in his right mind would do what OP did.  OP did not want to financially support another man\u2019s child.  Under every state in the US\u2019s laws, that responsibility belongs to the father of the child,\nnot the mother\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nUnder some states\u2019 laws, if OP married his gf and/or moved in with her, and later broke up, a judge could have ordered him to pay child support until the child finished college.  If not, then the actual father would be required to pay child support.  In no instance will a court not issue an order that child support must be paid.  The only thing argued over would be if OP or the actual father would pay it.\n\nLeaving whether OP could be required to pay child support in the future aside, AITA consistently judges people over debt issues.  Here, a child costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to raise has been born. In effect, a debt of hundreds of thousands of dollars has been created.  Under the law, the responsibility to pay that debt belongs to the parents.  It would be one thing if the Mom said, \u201cI have the financial ability to take on all of that debt and will gladly pay my \u201cfriend,\u201dthe father\u2019s portion without requiring him to contribute.\u201d  But that isn\u2019t the case here.  Mom doesn\u2019t have the financial resources necessary to pay this debt on her own.  So the father must be required to pay his share of the debt.  \n\nOP helped Mom and the baby\u2019s lives immensely by requiring her to get a child support order.  Mom\u2019s an asshole for blaming OP for making her get the father to pay his share of the debt.  Frankly, her caring more about what the father thinks of her and blaming OP for ruining his life is a huge red flag \ud83d\udea9that she cares more for the father than OP.

But the OP acting like a father before the court orders could make him get stuck paying for a baby that isn't his and who knows how long this relationship is going to last with the mom not even knowing who the bio dad was.  OP is a smart dude and NTA.", "He would have ended the relationship NOT because of the financial burden but because of his girlfriend\u2019s unwillingness to hold the bio father responsible and foisting off the consequences on the OP.

If I took responsibility for the baby and then we broke up I could be held financially responsible for the kid right?", "I wouldn\u2019t stay in a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t care enough about their child to get child support from their babies other parent.  Simple as that. It just shows they care more about their pride than doing what\u2019s right for their child. If the dude said no and she refused to get courts involved I would also leave her, easy as that. That money isn\u2019t about her, op, or the baby daddy. It is money that the baby is owed and if she would rather keep the boat from rocking than do what\u2019s best for her kid then she doesn\u2019t deserve a different sucker coming to fix her problems for her. \n\nShe got child support and she has a man to help raise her kid.

The guy can also come after her for custody, so it\u2019s the bio dad\u2019s responsibility AND choice. Bio dad has another dude raising his kid that he didn\u2019t want to deal with, so he\u2019s off the hook for that.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me that our country expects - and in many states - demands that women give up their bodies and lives for unintended pregnancy but it\u2019s actually a debate about whether the other arguably more at fault party has to partially finance his kid (his orgasm always carries the risk of pregnancy, but she doesn\u2019t even have to consent to get pregnant)", "OP should not be responsible financially, the fact he\u2019s willing to raise the baby is already above and beyond. The baby\u2019s biological parents need to make the bed they laid on and stop pinning the consequences on OP.", "No we're not. The reason people are calling multiple partners without condoms a \"red flag\" is because of spreading STDs. The risk of a baby with one partner is the same as with multiple. However with one partner you're not spreading STDs around to multiple people. That's why you should use protection, not just the pill.", "Kid 1: Bari and alto sax\n\nKid 2: Tenor sax\n\nKid 3: French horn, trumpet, guitar", "Yeah and so did he. It sounds like they were both just hoping it was his", "You might want to look into what being not exclusive means... \n\nThey were fucking other people at first as well as each other.

At no point did op act surprised or angry that she slept with someone else.", ">But surely she knew she slept with other people.\n\nAnd so did OP. Sounds like OP was holding out hope the kid was theirs.", "First paragraph says they weren't exclusive to begin with.  Where was she hiding anything from him?", "... They both knew?

You are protecting yourself in the best possible way. Is it a little cold? Sure, but its still the right thing.", "How is anyone calling this guy the AH? He was upfront with her right away. He\u2019s taking a great roll with a kid that\u2019s not his but, they\u2019re just dating. She might date a lot of different guys before she finds the right one. Each of those guys isn\u2019t an AH because they don\u2019t take on her child as their own for the rest of their lives. And this kid will never think his father abandoned him if things don\u2019t work out because he\u2019ll know who his biological father and mother are and, unfortunately because of his parent\u2019s poor decisions, he\u2019s also going to know about boyfriends and girlfriends and breakups and blended families.

Child support probably wouldn't even cover rent if your girl and the baby were on their own. You're stepping up to the plate and will providing a roof, food, and a bunch of other stuff for this kid. It's not unreasonable to demand the bio father to help with expenses regardless of how much better you're doing in life than him.  He shouldn't have been fucking around on his fiancee if he wasn't prepared for this.

If you plan to stick around despite this: your best course if for the child support to pay for the child, and you can put whatever you want into a trust which only falls into the child\u2019s upon your death, and then if you\u2019re still around when it\u2019s time for college, you can change it into their name.", "NTA! Op, do you really see a long term relationship with a woman who knowingly slept with her engaged friend?", "Just sharing the household as your girlfriends partner is enough for a judge to see you hold that responsibility so...", "Yes you could.", "Because this is the case, NTA. If it weren't, you'd be treading a thin line regarding strangers' sympathy, but you are right. The bio dad needs to contribute, whether or not he wants to be a part of his kid's life.", "In many US states, yes, as you would have voluntarily taken a parental role.

If OP's girlfriend is gonna let more than one guy bust a nut in her, she has to take responsibility. Is she going to keep screwing other guys and expect him to pay up when she gets knocked up again? What if they break up? He is being remarkably supportive IMO. And I don't feel bad for the baby daddy at all, cheating on his fiance. He's sorry he got caught.", "It\u2019s actually also necessary for him to protect himself because my understanding is the law in some states is that if you take on a fatherly role you can be sued for child support\n\nIt\u2019s completely reasonable for him not to take on a fatherly role to the kid if he is not sure this relationship is going to last and doesn\u2019t want to be sued for child support in future \n\nBlame the unfair law for his behaviour if you find it assholeish", "It also shows how much she values her current relationship with OP and the welfare of her child when she\u2019s blaming OP for ruining daddy fuck buddy\u2019s life by not supporting her child.", "You just made that up, lol.
