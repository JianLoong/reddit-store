Last week we went to his sisters wedding, I\u2019m not super close with most of his family but we grew up in the same town so I knew a lot of the people who were at the wedding. I haven\u2019t told a lot of people about my pregnancy, I\u2019ve had a lot of anxiety about miscarrying throughout it so we decided to only tell close friends and family and when I post on any social media I wear baggy clothes and pose so that my bump is hidden. I wore a loose fitting dress to the wedding but it was still very obvious I was pregnant. Because I\u2019ve been keeping my pregnancy pretty hidden it was a lot of peoples first time seeing me pregnant and I had people coming up to me pretty much all night congratulating me. I could tell his sister was upset about it so I tried to downplay it when people came over but there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it. The day after the wedding my boyfriends mom called him pissed off that I wouldn\u2019t say anything to people before hand because I took the attention away from his sister all night. I feel bad for his sister but I don\u2019t think I should have to make a pregnancy announcement before I\u2019m ready andIm\nnot sure how I could\u2019ve told people beforehand aside from calling up the entire guest list which is just ridiculous. My boyfriend is on my side but his mom, sister, and apparently a lot of his other family meme her are upset with me. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to clarify:\nThe bride knew, everyone\u2019s immediate family knew about it, and close friends knew about it. My boyfriend and I grew up in the same town, went to the same high school but didn\u2019t start dating or even really become friends until after we graduated college. A lot of the wedding guests knew us but we hadn\u2019t seen them in years. Most of them do follow me on social media though because we all went to school together. The reason we didn\u2019t announce it on social media is because my boyfriend and I have a few thousand followers on instagram combined and there were maybe 100 people at this wedding who knew us enough to be shocked but we weren\u2019t close enough with to tell. I didn\u2019t think about posting beforehand but even now looking back I wouldn\u2019t tell 2000+ people on social media just so the 100 at this wedding would know specifically. My BF and I live far enough away from our hometown where running into people and them seeing me pregnant is an issue. I\u2019m not going to make a full announcement until the baby is born. We were keeping it really secret until made it to 20 weeks (only immediate family and a few friends knew) and since then it\u2019s been more like we haven\u2019t been going out of our way to tell people.", "created_utc": 1667255747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yir4uf/aita_for_revealing_my_pregnancy_at_a_wedding/", "score": 3869, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The bride can't be talking to everyone at once, but apparently when she's not taking to people they should all be staring adoringly at her and whispering to each other about how wonderful she is. NTA, it's not like you made a big announcement, she invited you and you just existed as a pregnant person. If she can't handle your existence at the expense of her fragile little ego, why did she let you come to start with?", "NTA.\n\nYou are not required to make an announcement about anything in your life prior to attending someone's wedding.  It's not as if you stood up and said, \"guess what everyone?  I'm pregnant!\"  You just went about being a guest at a wedding.\n\nThe mom, sister, and the other family members should be focusing on their happy celebration and stop focusing on your pregnancy.  It was only a problem cuz THEY made it a problem.\n\nETA:  Thanks for the awards.  : )", "NTA\n\nI can NOT believe that people are actually saying she should have announced her pregnancy so that she would not take attention from the bride. WHAT!!!!!!! It\u2019s her body, her baby (and boyfriend\u2019s), and the choice of when, how, and where to share is hers and the baby\u2019s father!!! COME ON PEOPLE!! So pregnant women shouldn\u2019t attend weddings unless they share the news so no one will be surprised!?!?!?! REALLY!?!? It is VERY likely that even if some people knew about the pregnancy, it was still nice to see OP pregnant as many of the people from her home town had not seen her in a while. Most people are genuinely happy for pregnant couples. \n\nDo people actually think that everything stops on a person\u2019s wedding day as to keep 100% of the attention on the bride and groom?", "I don't understand all these Y T A s, don't invite a pregnant woman to your wedding if you don't want people talking about it.\n\nShe knew you are pregnant, your immediate family and close friends knew. So it's not like it was a huge shock to the family. \n\nYou're not obligated to tell people you're not close with and the people you went to highschool with several years ago, even if you did they'd still come up to you and ask about the baby. She knew you had common acquaintances that be attending the wedding that didn't know about the pregnancy, she knew they'd ask.\n\nWhen someone is carrying a baby there's always going to be attention on them, if the bride didn't want that attention on you then she shouldn't habe invited you. Its her own fault.\n\nNTA", "Edited based on info: YTA\n\nINFO: were his family free to tell people? Or did they know, but you guys asked them to not spread the news?", "NTA.  Anybody who is 7 months pregnant is going to get a lot of attention at any family & friend gathering, even if people already knew.  Not just congratulations, but asking how you are and are you ready, and everything.  Hopefully MIL will back off.", "NTA. Why should it be your responsibility to notify every single person on your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s guest list that you\u2019re expecting? There are no rules that you must disclose every major life event happening to you before someone\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s not like you stood up and shouted it from the rooftops during her reception. You went out of your way to HIDE it. \n\nYour body, you decide what you do with it and who you tell about it.", "Let\u2019s just go into the way back machine\u2026 to a time before announcing things on the internet. If this were 25-30 years ago her showing up pregnant (after telling family and close friends like the SIL) would have had the same result. Should she have broken out her address book and sent announcements via snail mail to each and every contact she\u2019s had since 6th grade in order to \u201cavoid\u201d this situation? There is no obligation to tell people before a wedding you\u2019re preggo to avoid (gasp) daring to show your preggo self in public. Brides need to stop.

Hold your stomach in or bind your belly somehow?   NTA  How ridiculous is this family?  Think long and hard before you marry this guy because his mother and sister are truly awful people to be mad about your pregnancy.", "NTA. I am so sick and tired of all these self obsorbed attention seeking brides.  Everyone is there for the wedding.  I am sure they also gave her a ton of attention.  Are they then supposed to just sit and avert there eyes so that they don't accidently give anyone else some attention? And it sounds like the main family at the wedding knew. People really need to get over themselves.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't reveal anything that was secret. I don't know any of my friends that told the whole world just in case they have to go to a wedding \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI mean ffs, people talked to you and about it for like what? 5-10 mins of their time? You didn't take anything away from the bride. \n\nWhat did she expect? Everyone to be a soldier and only pay attention to her?", "NAH, People probably came and spoke to you about it periodically, but at the end of the day, they\u2019re all there for the wedding. A few minutes of conversation don\u2019t take away from the bride\u2019s whole day.", "I went to a wedding 2 weeks ago. Someone had the audacity to bring a 3 month old.  And he was dressed in an adorable little suit.  I cannot believe the bride didnt have the parents forcibly removed for having the audacity to bring their breast fed newborn to a close family wedding.  I mean, so many people paid attention to the baby and googooed and gaagaaed over him they almost forgot about the bride and ruined her whole wedding.\n\nOh wait, that isnt how it happened.  Everyone had a great time, we celebrated the couple, and the bride even danced with the baby.  I think the photographer even got some great pictures of the baby.", "NTA. You were just existing, as a pregnant person. You don't owe anyone an announcement, especially if you're not ready or are being cautious.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. If all the important people knew, which it seems like they did, you aren\u2019t really obligated to tell anyone else. Regardless, people give pregnant women extra attention anyway even if they know prior. I\u2019m currently almost 6 months pregnant and people I see daily at work come up to me to ask me how things are going, how I\u2019m feeling, etc. It\u2019s just the nature of things. You even did your best to not bring attention to yourself and the baby bump. It\u2019s not your job to notify people on her guest list that you are or aren\u2019t pregnant.", "NTA.\n\n\nI also didn't share my pregnancy...I had people who were surprise I gave birth. People who saw me regularly knew but extended people/FB friends did not.\n\n\nPregnant women are going to get attention no matter where you go. Random people at the grocery store would say congratulations. \n\n\nI think the bride is overreacting as she was aware you were pregnant.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t come into the wedding shouting your news. You were just visibly pregnant. You don\u2019t owe anyone a social media announcement beforehand and it sounds like the important people already knew. I\u2019m so tired of seeing posts on here about brides feeling like their thunder was stolen. Literally the entire wedding is about the bride and groom. Aren\u2019t they tired of the attention at some point?", "NTA.\n\nWhen did it become necessary for everyone else\u2019s lives to stop until someone\u2019s wedding is over? \n\nIt would be one thing if you made a big fuss over it and deliberately drew attention from the bride. But you just attended a wedding. You happen to be pregnant. And? \n\nFWIW, I never ever assume anyone is pregnant, ever, unless they say they are themselves. I had a hairdresser get mad at me for NOT mentioning her pregnancy, but since she never mentioned it, I figured she had her reasons and maybe she was just gaining weight. Not my business.", "Are y\u2019all fucking serious? She didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t have to announce her pregnancy to anyone. As long as the dad knows, nobody else is privy to that information. Especially, since close family and friends knew. Losing a baby is a real scare and it\u2019s even worse when people know about the pregnancy and are looking for the baby. The ah is the bride who is so insecure that her brother\u2019s own baby arriving upset her.", "NTA,  You showed up to a wedding pregnant. For most folks there's no way to hide a 7month bump. You tried not make a big deal of it.

Were your BF's family generally on that list?\n\nAt this point, you are very pregnant. So pregnant that people who see you and realize you're pregnant (which is everyone who sees you) will wonder why they weren't told earlier. So you kind of didn't just exist while pregnant at this wedding (which is a definite not asshole situation), you showed up to the wedding with a major situation that was absolutely going to cause consternation and comment while people wonder why the heck they didn't hear about this before: is this actually a tumor? Quadruplets? Do you secretly hate them? What on earth? And that is a li'l bit of an asshole move. At the least, you could have talked to the bride or your BF's mom about how best to handle the situation. \n\nWeddings are hotbeds of family drama. I accidentally caused a scandal at my sister's by showing up late to the rehearsal dinner because I stopped by the mall to pick up her wedding night lingerie for her.

Yes, not revealing your pregnancy to everyone would be shocking at the wedding. It\u2019s impossible for people not to notice and the lack of public acknowledgement (beyond immediate family) makes your pregnancy seem scandalous at best and fatal for your or your child at worst. It\u2019s so removed from expectations that, yes, it is a massive distraction. \n\nYour refusal to make any type of announcement or even to tell your boyfriend\u2019s mother OR the bride to circulate the news quietly meant your sudden appearance as heavily pregnant at your sister-in-law\u2019s wedding was now jarring news. You didn\u2019t need to blast the news on social media, but your aversion to revealing your pregnancy publicly is so extreme that it cut off even pre-social media circulation of news among family and friends. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest here: You are a social media celebrity. You\u2019re trying to dance around it, but you are at least social media famous. You KNOW that your pregnancy will be major news. It will turn heads. It\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to make an announcement until the baby was born. Just telling your immediate family and close friends and then turning up to your boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding heavily pregnant without any type of news spreading is unacceptable. You KNOW that people care too much about your personal life AND know that the interest in your pregnancy can be a distraction.\n\nWere people supposed to know? Not know? Comment? Not comment? In the first trimester, when a pregnancy might not be announced even if visible due to understandable concerns about viability, people could, would, and should say nothing. It\u2019s understandable that parents might be nervous. It\u2019s understandable that miscarriages have a higher likelihood of occurring. \n\nYour anxiety as seven months is so out of step with reality. YOU ARE SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT. It\u2019s now actively weird to not acknowledge your pregnancy\u2014And, I\u2019m sorry, but are you that anxious or are you that determined to have your baby\u2019s birth be a big social media moment? Be honest with yourself. And if you didn\u2019t want to make a pregnancy announcement, you needed to rely on your boyfriend\u2019s mother and sister running inference for you. That\u2019s completely fair! Lots of people did they prior to social media\u2014it was totally normal! But you didn\u2019t opt for a pre-social media approach\u2014You just applied a weird black out to pregnancy news. You made your pregnancy the major, scandalous news of the wedding by not acknowledging it publicly far past the point of social convention (which again is worse because you are famous on social media).\n\nAnd if you truly couldn\u2019t handle that?

That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much social etiquette about not making major announcements at weddings. It\u2019s hijacking a major milestone event that is paid for by someone else to draw attention for oneself.

Arriving to a wedding seven months pregnant without a prior pregnancy announcement or new spreading is a pregnancy announcement in and of itself and is unacceptable. OP and her boyfriend absolutely had options here: Make a social media announcement prior to the wedding; let the family circulate the news otherwise on her behalf; or avoid the wedding and any reveal.\n\nIs a pregnancy scandalous? No, absolutely not! But OP and her boyfriend handled the reveal in the way one handles a scandal, not positive personal news.

Oh and the photos were on the side of a hill and I stupidly sat on the ground next to the other bridesmaids to get of my feet while we had a picnic while bride and groom were getting their photos done then need three people to help me up but hey even the bride laughed at that... the main question I actually got asked was where my eldest was so I always answered with pregnancy humour, bride wanted no kids but as this little guy (pointing to my stomach) is just too attached so I could only leave his big bro at great grans (this was always done in ear shot of a couple who brought their three kids to the wedding and they kept getting in the way)", "It kinda is, as OP was talked to/told off because she didn't somehow announce it to all people she has known at some point in her life, prior to the wedding.", "No you didn\u2019t.

No. Either way people are going to make a fuss because everybody loves a pregnant lady and everyone loves to have an opinion. There was no way out of it.

What do *they* think that you should have done? Not come to the wedding at all? Worn some sort of garment that covered all of your features so no would could see a baby bump? Wear a corset? Get an ab\\*rtion? What on earth did they expect you to do?", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t stop everyone and demand attention by making  a formal announcement at the wedding.  Many times there are friends and family at a wedding that you don\u2019t see every day, so there is a chance people catch up and share new developments.", "You didn't announce it and people noticed and came up to you. I was at my best friends wedding a few years ago and I was pregnant with twins. We weren't sharing beyond our family and close friends. I wore a baggy dress. I knew most of my best friend's friends. I intentionally didn't leave my table to make sure I didn't draw attention to myself. But also covid made it possible not to interact with people lol so I didn't steal their spotlight. Based on the situation described im going to go with NTA", "NTA, you didn\u2019t DO anything\u2026", "Everybody just needs to be happy for everybody.  More joy at the event!  Being that competitive just seems wrong to me.", "Exactly. Existing in public while pregnant is not a crime last I checked, and people's lives don't go into stasis just because someone else gets married. The people who are freaking out about OP need to get a grip.", "I (Bride) got married 3 weeks ago. After my ceremony ended I waited less than 5 minutes to run over and ask one of my guests if she was a grandma again (I knew her daughter was due any day so their RSVP was tentative). I congratulated her before she was able to congratulate me. Because life is more than just one day.", "Before social media, the situation would have been exactly the same. If the guests hadn\u2019t heard via word of mouth before the wedding, they would have found out at the wedding.", "Also, even if you had announced it online beforehand, people would still congratulate you when seeing you in person, so there\u2019s nothing you really could have done.", "The last wedding I went to people ended up talking about my shoes.\n\nMy shoes.", "The bride was aware that not everybody knew about the pregnancy as only family and close friends knew by the time the wedding came.  So what did she expect?\n\nPeople to just not notice at all or if they did for OP to just ignore them and walk away if they came up to her? It is a lot faster and less fuss to just politely say thank you for the congrats and move on.", "Let\u2019s be honest. My sister\u2019s dogs got a million times the amount of attention her and her husband did on their wedding day. Absolutely no one was upset about that", "This is like saying you shouldn't attend the wedding of a close friend or family member while 9 months pregnant because if you go into labor, you'll take the attention away from the couple.\n\nI can't fathom being 9 months pregnant and taking the effort to be at someone's wedding if they aren't very dear to you.  So I likewise can't fathom making a big deal about people being in a conversation creating stage of life and getting talked to about it.", "It's the whole tradition of the wedding being \"the bride's special day\" that needs to change. A wedding is not just about one person, it's about a combining of family, a chance for everyone to be together and celebrate something beautiful. Long lost friends and family are catching up, reminiscing over old times and enjoying each other's company (ideally, although most likely tensions are everywhere). Yes as the bride you are one of the most important parts of it, but it's still not all about you.", "I showed up at a cousin's wedding, gasp, not drinking wine.  Bride's sister zeroed in on me and guessed.  Bless her, she is one of the most reasonable people ever, and kept it quiet, we called her later that week when the doctor  confirmed it.", "My  best friend didn't tell many people when she was pregnant. She didn't hide it, but only actually told close family and friends. Add in the fact the she had always been a \"no kids\" kind of person, plus she moved overseas after university and it was pretty funny when  she posted pics of him online after he was born saying \"oh, btw, did this last week\".", "Did i, like, imagine the part where OP chose a baggier dress for the wedding? At 7 months pregnant, there isn't really a lot of ways to hide that in person. You can't just skillfully pose yourself by a corner all night with your body angled in a specific way to hide the bump. What do you expect OP to do?  Bind her stomach in a vain attempt to mask it? \n\nNobody owes anyone anything, especially not an announcement about a child that you have inside your own body. NTA.", "Before the Internet were pregnant women expected to call hundreds of people to announce their pregnancy pre-weddings? Because OPs close family did know, just not the wider community/in laws/distant friend circles.", "What is wrong with you? Stop making things up.", "I hope you sit, read your comment carefully and then realise how ridiculous it all sounds. People needs to stop being obsessed over not being the center of the universe for a few mins during your wedding.", "OPs family also conveniently forgets that not everybody sees everybody\u2019s posts on Facebook.  You see only a small selection of your friends posts each day.  So even if she did make an announcement there was no guarantee all 100 people would even see it.", "If she announced a week before or whatever, all the people she sees irregularly or hadn't seen in years would still be coming up to congratulate her anyways.", "Inviting well wishers to her baby shower on the spot would have been an asshole move.  Existing while pregnant is not.", "I mean, it's not like you could have removed the bellt and left it home! NTA. You didn't announce anything. Simply attended a wedding that you were invited to.", "That\u2019s hilarious, like a scene out of a movie. You sound like you handled it well, appreciated how hard they pushed it to get there from another country, and accepted their bombastic entrance as who they are in those kind of situations, and rolled with it. Now you have a highly entertaining and endearing wedding story instead of one of unnecessary drama simply because of the way you, and your partner, chose to react to it.   Keep being awesome \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\ude0e", "The bartender collapsed at my brother-in-law\u2019s wedding and got taken out in an ambulance right as the ceremony started. Things happen! (They had delayed the wedding when it happened, in part because a lot of the guests were doctors and were helping. The timing of the ambulance was just weird.)", "I went to community college and two people from my pre-law class got married. Our professor and a few other people showed up late during the ceremony and entered through the bushes. On top of that, our professor gave a speech later and inadvertently pointed out the bride and groom were distant cousins (it turned the bride\u2019s Mee Maw and the groom\u2019s Great Aunt Polly **were the same person**). Talk about attention-stealing!", "\\- Yes, the couple is the focus during the ceremony and pivotal moments of   \nthe reception, but otherwise you\u2019re just eating and mingling and   \ncatching up with people you haven\u2019t seen in awhile\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think most couples really overestimate how much of a focus they are. I've been to plenty of weddings, and me and most people I know see it as an opportunity to eat and mingle... Very little focus on the couple, and more so on the wider family.", "It's entirely possible for someone to upstage the bride in rude ways but they are mostly obvious and would apply to most events like \"don't make an announcement at a wedding without approval\" \"stick to the dress code\" and \"don't get drunk and make distracting bad life choices\" \n\nIt's entirely fair that the couple should get to be the center of attention at their event. It's their event, but unless OP had hid the pregnancy from the family and nobody knew than it's fine. There are bound to be people reconnecting at a wedding.", "It particularly confuses me because weddings are typically gatherings of people who care about one another but may not see each other often - it seems only natural that there will be lots of congratulations on other life events and milestones that have happened since you last saw each other, whether that's a pregnancy or a new job or an engagement or a graduation. Unless you're stealing the microphone at the reception to announce it to the whole room, no one is doing anything wrong.", "> This notion of \u201cstealing attention from the bride\u201d just because you have a congratulatory conversation with someone else is SO absurd.\n\nAll I can think in these stories where a bride pillories some wedding attendee for merely existing is that the bride must have the personality of a newspaper left out in a rainstorm.", "And even if she had posted, people would have come up to her at the wedding to congratulate her anyway - that's what you do the first time you see someone in person who's had a major life event happen since the last time you saw them.", "Also people might well have congratulated her in person even if they saw the social media post. One thing if she wasn\u2019t showing and had actually announced, but what exactly did the bride expect her to do \u2014 leave the bump at home for the day?!", "Happy Cake Day!", "MIL only said something because the bride was upset about this. On such a happy day why be upset about other people noticing someone else. No one is going to a wedding and spending 100% of the time noticing only the bride. That\u2019s an unreasonable expectation for anyone to have no matter how much money they spent on the wedding. Weddings are for families to come together and catch up with each other while celebrating the bride and groom. That expectation makes her a bridezilla imho.", "My SIL actually did go into labor at her BIL and SIL's wedding at eight months pregnant, her water broke on the dance floor and everything, and I don't think anyone held it against her because they were too busy being happy for the marriage and the new baby. NTA", "Exactly at my mum and stepdads wedding I got a bunch of attention since I was maid of honour, I'm disabled, and I was the only one to make a speech (my uncle was best man and supposed to as well but ate a dodgy takeaway the night before, got food poisoning and only just made it through the wedding lol) but obviously my mum wasn't upset by this and neither was my stepdad, he just hugged me and then embarrassingly showed everyone who asked about the wedding a video of the speech for weeks after. \n\nIt felt like a celebration of their love and our family, not a special day for one person and personally I think thats the best thing a wedding can be.", "The bride isn't though. She's allowed to be upset that her day wasn't just about her. You put months to years into wedding planning and wanting it perfect. It would suck to do all that work to be overshadowed. Was the OP wrong for not telling people? No, but the bride wasn't wrong to have jealous feelings either. NAH", "The fact that last night this was the top comment and now has negative karma makes me have a *little* more faith in humanity lol. Sanity has prevailed!", "Beautifully said. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThey are totally justified going LC/NC with the absurdly  entitled family. We teach people how to treat us, and apparently family of fools needs a big lesson.", "That we're faaamiiilly remind me of the piecing patty stories lol", "I had a friend from abroad come to my wedding. I was really worried about him having a good time, because I knew I'd be able to give him like.... 3 attention at best, since you know, my wedding. I made sure to sit him at a \"hip young table\" and told my friends to take care of him, so he'd have people hang out with and have fun. \n\nOf *course* I got attention at my wedding, but people need something to do the rest of the time! If people were sitting around just watching me the whole time, they wouldn't be having fun. It's so fucking ridiculous.", "With ya.  Back in the day I'd go to a wedding and there'd usually be a cousin or two turning up pregnant.  \"Hey coz, congrats to you and Sean!  When's baby due?  And ain't the bride a gem?\"  Boom.  Done.  Time to hit the buffet.", "And this was one of the joys of attending weddings, etc. Now, more than ever, we NEED the excuse to get together with extended family and exchange information, news, and take pictures.

Clearly she lost all that weight just to show up her sister (the bride) at the wedding and was a major AH /s", "Out of all the weddings I have been to it has never crossed my mind to tell the couples about what's going with me visually. I dress nicely, what the fuck more do they want?", "I definitely have family that would have made it their mission to seek her out and talk shop if they knew before hand. So much unwanted advice, personal and invasive questions, fawning over touching the baby belly, etc.", "I don't get this logic that the WEDDING they were all at wasn't about the bride and groom just because people noticed Op's existence. People don't just sit there and only talk about the bride and groom at weddings, that's an absurd expectation.", "So much pettiness/jealousy for a pregnant lady who's carrying their nibbling. Get a grip there's no such thing as a \"perfect\" wedding. There is however expectation and disappointment and that can happen even with the smallest detail.  NTA", "she didn't do anything except attend while pregnant.  being jealous of that makes just as much sense as being jealous about how auntie mabel told little billy how much taller he is since she last saw him.  would you be upset at a teenager for getting taller?  no, that's stupid.  so don't be upset about a pregnant woman being pregnant.", "Anyone expecting perfection out of anything with so many moving parts is an idiot.", "Why? Why would it be necessary to announce to hundreds of people you barely know that you\u2018re pregnant?

Our middle daughter was born with a lot of birth defects and lifelong issues from a genetic anomaly we didn't know I carried, and we wanted to know as much about baby's health as possible before announcing. \n\n3 days before we planned to announce, we learned that my husband's cousin committed suicide.  I just couldn't insert my beautiful, joyous announcement into all that pain.  We ended up announcing closer to 6 months and because of my scoliosis, I looked 9 months pregnant.\n\nIt happens.  For me, part of the decision to wait was being unwilling to discuss the ethics of me being pregnant and knowing their was some amount of chance the new baby could be born with big sister's condition.  I wanted to enjoy our little miracle and protect myself until we knew who it was and could present our growing bump baby with a name.", "I was 7m pregnant at my brother's wedding. Everyone knew, including the bride's family, but they all still came to speak to me in person, ask about the baby, etc, because that's what people do. My SIL is lovely, and we have pics of the two of us, the sibling groups etc, just as if I *wasn't* the size of a house. She was careful to include me in everything/make accommodations (I was on crutches for the last trimester).    \n\nBabies are part of family life, and so are weddings, they're not automatically exclusive concepts and it's weird that anyone thinks a wedding is 100% about the bride and groom. \"First time we've seen Cousin G since he moved to Australia\" is just as noteworthy as a pregnant woman - do brides freak out about that? (Yes, I suppose they do. Sigh.)", "Thank you! I can highly recommend booting toxic people out of your life, even those with shared DNA. Especially those with shared DNA.

Nice knowing we could have skipped the effort and expected them to all talk about Me.", "I admire the tenacity and commitment of anyone who could stick to such a dastardly plan for an entire year.", "Absolutely! This bride is being absurd.", "As a recent bride that put years into making the wedding what I wanted, she was not a bridezilla for wanting her special day to be about her and the groom. Did the OP do something wrong by not telling people she was pregnant? No, but the bride wasn't wrong for her feelings either.", "I\u2019d say the bride isn\u2019t TA because she never confronted or talked to OP about it. Mom did. Feelings/emotions aren\u2019t always rational, but at least she reigned them in.\n\nI doubt the wedding was overshadowed by one pregnancy though.", "Yay for love!", "Luckily I don't have anyone like this in my life that I'm related to (I had to cut off a few 'friends' though), but if I did, I would say bye, and never talk to them again.", "I went to a friend's wedding solo once, and despite being in my 20's I was seated at a table with 3 couples in their 50s. There were plenty of tables with younger people... \n\nI was annoyed at first, but would never say anything  at a friend's wedding. However, once I started talking with the couples, I realized I probably had more in common with them then any of the younger guests (shared professions and such). \n\nI had a blast, and I realized how much she had truly thought about the people I would enjoy myself with. Table settings are hard, I was honoured she thought so much about mine.", "Her feelings don't make her a bridezilla.  How she acts after this is all said and done may make her an asshole though.", "The day already is about the bride and groom. Literally noticing another human being won't ruin their wedding. People take wedding BS way too seriously and it shouldn't be normal.", "OP edited the post and clarified that the bride knew she was pregnant before the wedding", "As I understood it, the bride's mother was an AH not the bride.

And she\u2019s allowed to keep that social life off of social media. They aren\u2019t the same people as her followers. It\u2019s the bride\u2019s family that is acting self-centered as though no one else should exist on the wedding day.", "That makes sense.  Also, my \"may be an asshole\" verdict also applies to the bride's future behavior. \n\nThe bride's mother is unreasonable at best and likely an asshole.  We can't all stop breathing just because it's a spotlight moment for someone else.  We take who we are in the present moment, dress for the occasion, and show up as ourselves to support people we care about.  Expecting someone to do otherwise is illogical.", "That\u2019s a bit unhinged.

It's immature and shallow.", "OP would\u2019ve had people commenting on her pregnancy even if she had posted on SM beforehand though because a lot of these people haven\u2019t seen her in person in years. Fuck, one of my best friends is pregnant right now and at my engagement dinner we still all talked about her pregnancy/the baby despite the fact that a majority of people in attendance see her on an almost-weekly basis. A pregnant person is going to garner attention whether or not people know about the pregnancy ahead of time.\n\nSave for not attending at all, there was nothing OP could\u2019ve done differently in this situation. I don\u2019t understand how the bride can be frustrated at her for not announcing it on SM - doing so would\u2019ve likely had a very immaterial impact on the amount of attention OP received.", "Absolutely,  the bride's mom was definitely being an AH, but so far nothing has been said that would show the bride was anything more than jealous. To me that doesn't make her an AH.", "I never said people couldn't visit or talk and make a fuss over her. If you read my comments you would have actually seen that I said the bride had a right to be jealous, but the OP had a right not to tell anyone. So maybe try reading before calling someone unhinged.", "I agree that the OP posting about it would have made no difference,  but the bride was still allowed to be jealous.
