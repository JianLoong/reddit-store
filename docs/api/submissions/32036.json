Any true friend wouldn\u2019t have a problem with accommodating it. Not sure why your friends are disregarding your request, but if they continue I would start to think about if they\u2019re your real friends or not.", "NTA.    \n\n\nOh yes, the old \"you're too serious\" defense when someone politely and repeatedly asks that someone show respect.    \n\n\nRolling my eyes so hard.  I think I'd invent a slightly tacky nickname for each of them and just keep using it.", "NTA a joke is only a joke when everyone is on board.", "NTA - to continue to use a name that they have been told is not welcome is bullying.  Your \"friends\" are bullying your BF before actually meeting him, don't sound like they are really your friends.", "NTA! Your friends are the type of people who won't understand until they get the same treatment. So petty me would call them something that they absolutely hate until they get with the program. Or just don't respond until they can be decent humans and do this one simple request you've asked of them, which isn't hard at all.", "NTA. \n\nIf you try and make a joke work and someone comes back and says this is actually a boundary please don\u2019t cross it then the joke is over. Continuing the bit doesn\u2019t make it funny it makes you an AH. \n\nIt gets to a point where they aren\u2019t being lighthearted about it and they are doing it on purpose. If you\u2019ve told them multiple times and they\u2019re still attempting low hanging fruit jokes then they\u2019re AHs. Sounds a bit toxic and maybe it\u2019s time to rethink some of these friendships.", "NTA, you've asked once, nicely. The fact that they continued after that marks them out as bullies. Don't introduce your boyfriend to these people. Ever.", "I\u2019d be reevaluating if these people are friends\u2026", "NTA. At all.\n\nI prefer the full version of my name, because I don\u2019t really like any of the shortened versions. And I hate it when people try to call me one of the short versions. \n\n1) It\u2019s not my name. I told you my name. \n\n2) It\u2019s disrespectful, and a kind of forced familiarity to give me a nickname when you barely know me.\n\n3) It\u2019s rude, full stop.\n\nPeople sometimes act like I\u2019m some kind of snob for wanting them to call me by my name - it\u2019s just a standard name, not even fancy (but even if it was, so what?), and I\u2019ve never understood that. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m demanding that they address me formally as Ms [surname] or something; I\u2019m just asking that they call me by my *actual name* that my friends, family and I use.\n\nIn short, your friends are being rude and disrespectful, and I\u2019d ask them what exactly the \u2018joke\u2019 is. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to explain it without realising they look like AHs.\n\nAnd thank you for standing up for your boyfriend.", "Nta but I do think both of you need to lighten up.\n\nI prefer Tom but people call me Tommy sometimes,  sometimes Dom or Tim on accident. I don't particularly like being called Thomas but it doesn't bother me,  they're all just variations or similar sounding names to mine, why would I care?\n\nHis name is Timothy, it's not that serious, what's the hang up about being called Tim or Timmy?", "NTA. You're in the right and they're wrong for not listening. It's a little gay to get this upset about it, but it's still a reasonable boundary to have.", "You need for have your BF tell them himself.

Their dismissal of your request to stop saying it is a low key dismissal of him. \n\nAre they jealous? Have you noticed this behaviour before? \n\nAnd good for you for sticking up for him even though he isn\u2019t there. Technically, he would never know they\u2019re doing it. But it\u2019s the kind of thing if you don\u2019t stop them now, they will say it in front of him.", "NTA. Be a broken record if you have to, but never let it slide. And then tell them, \"Stop joking in this manner, it's not funny, I don't find it funny,  and it's starting to piss me off.\" I have never understand why it's so hard for some people to use people's preferred names!", "NTA. You are absolutely in the right. Your friends are assholes, they arent right.", "Nta", "NTA. Are you sure they are your friends? They sound super disrespectful.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriends\u201d need to learn respect fast", "NTA, so-called friends who doesn't know when to stop, and keep on dismissing your (reasonable) demands and \"joking\" about it, are not friends. That simple.", "NTA but \"the joke\" is that you keep asking them - seems like they're ribbing on you because of your reaction, not on him, and I suspect if they ever meet him they won't say it to his face.", "NTA. You're helping enforce his boundaries. My bf has a similar thing, and gets around it by using a nickname for his middle name. My mom jokingly calls him some of those hated first-name nicknames when talking to me and every time I have to remind her that if she's going to use his first name instead of his preferred nickname, she needs to use his whole first name. It's like if he was Robert and mom jokingly asks about \"Bobby\", when really he goes by Eddie because his middle name is Edwin.", "NTA", "Compare it to dead naming someone. Make them see its the same. Nta", "NTA at all. As someone who goes by their full name and loathes the shortened versions of it, it drives me insane when people assume I go by a shortened version or just disregard when I tell them \u201cI go by Y, never by Z\u201d", "I am starting to consider just not contacting them again. One of them DM'd me to have a go and said \"How was \\[friend I asked to use the right name\\] suppposed to know?\" about my bfs name. As if... I hadn't mentioned his actual name multiple times and brought it up before? I dont understand why you would use a random nickname to a person you've never met anyway. I've never been told about a Richard then started calling them Dick because I felt like it.", "Boyfriend. Also not really seeing how warning others about a boundry your partner has so they dont disrespect him to his face is a pain in the ass.", "Yeah that\u2019s super weird dude. All you asked is that they stop using a certain name. That\u2019s such an easy request to honor. The fact that it\u2019s even a point of debate for them is so sketchy. Sorry but these people don\u2019t sound like true friends at all.", "Yeah, your friends are strange. Why do they feel the need to double down on this? Someone's name isn't a debate, you call them what they want to be called, done.\n\nWe met a new coworker in our office recently by name of Samantha. She was with a few of our team in a meeting, when our boss joined and greeted her with the words, \"Ah, you must be Sam? Nice to meet you.\" She smiled, shook his hand, and (firmly yet politely) said, \"Samantha.\" \n\nShe very smoothly made her preference clear, and everybody's been calling her Samantha. Because we're polite people.", "\"Even if \"friend\" had somehow missed that I've corrected you all every single time you get it wrong, instead of getting offended, this was \"friend's\" opportunity to fix his mistake. Instead of pouncing on me to \"take a joke\", you all should be using that emotional energy to remember his actual name. None of you would like to be called something different, and it's weirdly aggressive that you all keep doing this intentionally. This doesn't have to be a big deal--just use the correct name, as there's literally no other reason for you to intentionally get it wrong other than to disrespect us\"\n\nHonestly, calling people by the name they prefer is such a basic human decency thing, you might want to invest your own energy into expanding your social circle. This IS really disrespectful, and if this sort of disrespect hasn't been observed in other areas previously, it's probably just the start and you'll begin seeing it elsewhere.", "So NTA, but Richard to Dick isn\u2019t the best comparison. Timothy to Tim is more like Zachary to Zach or Jonathan to Jon. It\u2019s so common that most people probably do it without thinking about it. I have a colleague, \u201cJonathan\u201d who had to tell me twice that he didn\u2019t like \u201cJon\u201d. I still have to call him by his last name, instead, just because it\u2019s hard for me not to reflexively shorten it. \n\nUsing the wrong name isn\u2019t a joke if it\u2019s not funny. You\u2019ve corrected them, they need to take that into account. Keep doing right by your boyfriend.", "Yes exactly! I\u2019ve tried to find a reason why your friends are disregarding your request to use his full name and can\u2019t. It\u2019s odd. Maybe they are trying to get a rise out of you knowing that you really dislike them doing it. \nRegardless it\u2019s disrespectful and if they won\u2019t stop you may want to consider a new group of friends! You are NTA", "My husband is the same. If I refer to him by his full name, that is what he prefers to be called. If I say in conversation \"Alexander told me a funny story yesterday\" it is downright rude for the person I'm talking to to say \"what did ALEX tell you?\" I am his wife, I know what he prefers to be called and refer to him that way. The same goes for you and your bf. You know what he likes to be called, you refer to him as Timothy. It shouldn't be hard for your so called friends to understand that", "I work with a Jonathan and he will correct people that call him John, that\u2019s his absolute right."]}
