I also asked what she thought about me wearing it to class (as long as i sit in the back) and she said it was too much. \n\nI told her i felt like she was embarrassed of me and didn\u2019t want me to express myself. I\u2019ve always been somewhat extreme in my appearance, i used to dye my hair, wear eyeliner, i\u2019ve been emo and punk and grunge, etc. I love my mohawk and it makes me happy. \n\nShe only wants me to wear it at home or shopping, but I like to do it all the time whether it\u2019s for class or dinner. I understand that it\u2019s an intense haircut, but i would never tell her what to do with her hair or appearance.

You said that when you started wearing it this way you asked her more than once what she thought of it. So she told you the truth. That you didn't like what she had to say is a you problem.\n\nAnd yes, she probably shouldn't have asked you not to wear it on certain occasions, but again . . . you had already opened the door by asking her repeatedly if she thought it was okay to wear in this situation or that, so it wasn't exactly outrageous for her to believe at that point that you WANTED her input, since you'd already asked for it repeatedly. She may have thought that you were looking to understand where it was or wasn't appropriate, since . . . well, that seems to be the impression you gave by asking about class vs other places. \n\nSo really, there are NAH. You are allowed to wear your hair however you want, but she's not an AH for sharing an opinion that you asked for, or for not having the opinion that you wanted her to have.
