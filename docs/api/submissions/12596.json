You said that when you started wearing it this way you asked her more than once what she thought of it. So she told you the truth. That you didn't like what she had to say is a you problem.\n\nAnd yes, she probably shouldn't have asked you not to wear it on certain occasions, but again . . . you had already opened the door by asking her repeatedly if she thought it was okay to wear in this situation or that, so it wasn't exactly outrageous for her to believe at that point that you WANTED her input, since you'd already asked for it repeatedly.

He died without any pain relief. Or to be exact the only pain relief prescribed for him was pills (which his body couldn't absorb anymore) that are meant for slight pain.

Some people are very sensitive to social harmony and being subtle/non-intrusive, and find it deeply embarrassing to act/dress in ways that draw attention to themselves. Others enjoy (or have at least no negative emotions about) the attention they get from others for behaving in unusual ways.
