(it's a job, you can hire out a neutral party for this who has no stake, and doesn't benefit, etc)  Your lawyer can give you options on that in your state, situation, and if it would be best, and can absolutely get that ball rolling for you.   \nIF your uncle his wife are screaming at you, and you feel being dishonest, or monetarily abusive with your father, I'd suggest that as well.   \nTalk to the lawyer.
