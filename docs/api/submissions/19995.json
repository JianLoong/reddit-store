My parents bought me everything, we lived in a beautiful house, and went on vacations. There was also money set aside for my college tuition. Fast forward to being 19.

We found ourselves in debt by my dads hospital bills and everything else. My dads brother stepped in to help us and called a lawyer. He assigned himself POA of my dads estate and health. We ended up suing and years later finally got a settlement. In those three years I had to grow up, I was raising my brother while checking on my dad in the hospital and working. We had bills so my uncle & I worked hard to keep our home. Any money that my parents had in the bank had to go towards bills, hospital bills, fees, etc\u2026 including my tuition money.

He encouraged me to go back to school but told me he couldn\u2019t pay for it (with my dads money). Because I was over 18.

He probably had the idea to use the money as he wishes from the beginning. Get a good lawyer if you don't already have one, and get copies of all documents related to the trust, POA, etc. **Read every single page**, and make notes if necessary so you understand everything; talk to the lawyer about any questions you have.

It is legally binding.   \nif you ONLY had a verbal agreement with the uncle about your education, that was a mistake.  \nYou might also talk about having a neutral party be the POA, or have an official money manager who is not family, has no ties, no stake, and is a professional. (it's a job, you can hire out a neutral party for this who has no stake, and doesn't benefit, etc)  Your lawyer can give you options on that in your state, situation, and if it would be best, and can absolutely get that ball rolling for you.   \nIF your uncle his wife are screaming at you, and you feel being dishonest, or monetarily abusive with your father, I'd suggest that as well.   \nTalk to the lawyer. You need something official, not just \"an agreement with your uncle\"... that obviously is causing stress and strain.   \nYour uncle may have other reasons, or feel the money is most needed to care for your father until his death and he doesn't want to remove large sums from it should an emergency happen.

It makes sense that an adult rather than teen world take on the role. I would consult with the lawyer about what options are available.
