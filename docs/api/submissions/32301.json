Possibly against the grain on this one.  The kids reply of \"come one Uncle....\" is completely inappropriate and the respect for teachers needs to come from the kids parents.  Not the teacher, uncle or not.  13 is DEFINITELY Old enough to be cognizant of the respect required for a teacher and using the relationship of uncle to try and get away with misbehaving is a parental issue.  \n\nThat uncle called him out I believe is perfectly appropriate and natural consequences for the hlkids attempt.", "My aunty was a teacher at my primary school when I was little.

You should have discussed this kind of boundary with him before you ever taught his class a single lesson and your sister is correct in what she said to you.", "YTA. Your sister is right. This is a boundary that should have been explained to your nephew from day one. Not just dropped on him and then embarrassing him in front of others when disciplining him.

After the first time, he should\u2019ve spoken to the child after class. \n\nSince he did not, the child thought it was okay to call him that - he is only 13 and kids develop differently, so it might\u2019ve not even occurred to him that it is odd. \n\nYTA - the first time OP told him to call him teacher should not have been in front of everyone", "I agree completely. \n\n\nMy dad was an elementary teacher, not at my own school, but relatively near my own school.  From the time I was in Kindergarten,  he told me before school started each year, that if I saw him on field trips or during the school day when there were other studentsaround, he was Mr \"Smith\", not \"Dad\".

First time. Now he knows better. He'll need to create a strategy for this situation if it happens again in future. That's to do between OP and whoever was his mentor/superior.\n\nWhen the nephew keeps currying favor with his uncle in a classroom full of his peers, it's important that the nephew AND the classmates know explicitly that OP will not tolerate misbehaviour from his nephew simply because the nephew brought the relationship into the conversation instead of heeding OP and stopping his mischief. Taking nephew aside would promote the illusion of favoritism and now nephew has the power to control the narrative and\u2014maybe this wouldn't happen but\u2014he could lie to his classmates to look cool about how his uncle let him off the hook and now it's OP's professionalism in question and his career on the line if one of those classmates had done what nephew did and told a parent leading that parent to call the school and complain instead of OP's sister only calling him because her precious little boy did nothing wrong.", "That is probably on the school not him.

Unless nephew wasn't in this class on that day the boundaries were already set. \n\nAs for taking the nephew out to the hall after calling him Uncle would only appear as preferential treatment.

YTA for this reason.", ">But Op had accepted the term before and had not told the nephew their boundary had changed. All Op needed to do was talk to the nephew in private.\n\nI agree, but what I got from this is that while the boy was calling OP \"uncle\" and participating in the class, it was not a problem. When he was being rightfully called out, him calling OP \"uncle\" led OP to think the personal relationship was compromising the respect a teacher is expected to get from a student (maybe the boy would have just dropped it if it was any other teacher reprimanding him? the boy's friend who was also called out didn't seem to have said anything back to OP).\n\nI think the conversation should have happened beforehand, but I believe the issue here is not calling OP uncle, but how this could impact the boy's behavior in class.
