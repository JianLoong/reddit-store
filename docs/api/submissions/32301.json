Possibly against the grain on this one.  The kids reply of \"come one Uncle....\" is completely inappropriate and the respect for teachers needs to come from the kids parents.  Not the teacher, uncle or not.  13 is DEFINITELY Old enough to be cognizant of the respect required for a teacher and using the relationship of uncle to try and get away with misbehaving is a parental issue.  \n\nThat uncle called him out I believe is perfectly appropriate and natural consequences for the hlkids attempt.", "My aunty was a teacher at my primary school when I was little.

You should have discussed this kind of boundary with him before you ever taught his class a single lesson and your sister is correct in what she said to you.", "YTA. Your sister is right. This is a boundary that should have been explained to your nephew from day one. Not just dropped on him and then embarrassing him in front of others when disciplining him.

Your nephew was misbehaving, this should have been the focus.  Instead he managed to twist it.", "The mom is right though. After the first time, he should\u2019ve spoken to the child after class. \n\nSince he did not, the child thought it was okay to call him that - he is only 13 and kids develop differently, so it might\u2019ve not even occurred to him that it is odd. \n\nYTA - the first time OP told him to call him teacher should not have been in front of everyone", "I agree completely. \n\n\nMy dad was an elementary teacher, not at my own school, but relatively near my own school.  From the time I was in Kindergarten,  he told me before school started each year, that if I saw him on field trips or during the school day when there were other studentsaround, he was Mr \"Smith\", not \"Dad\".  Occasionally, it happened. I was a sensitive kid and because he explained why & reminded me regularly,  it didn't hurt.  It just .... was.\n\n\nOP, \nI have to say... you are the adult in charge.

First time. Now he knows better. He'll need to create a strategy for this situation if it happens again in future. That's to do between OP and whoever was his mentor/superior.\n\nWhen the nephew keeps currying favor with his uncle in a classroom full of his peers, it's important that the nephew AND the classmates know explicitly that OP will not tolerate misbehaviour from his nephew simply because the nephew brought the relationship into the conversation instead of heeding OP and stopping his mischief. Taking nephew aside would promote the illusion of favoritism and now nephew has the power to control the narrative and\u2014maybe this wouldn't happen but\u2014he could lie to his classmates to look cool about how his uncle let him off the hook and now it's OP's professionalism in question and his career on the line if one of those classmates had done what nephew did and told a parent leading that parent to call the school and complain instead of OP's sister only calling him because her precious little boy did nothing wrong.", "That is probably on the school not him.

Unless nephew wasn't in this class on that day the boundaries were already set. \n\nAs for taking the nephew out to the hall after calling him Uncle would only appear as preferential treatment.

YTA for this reason.", ">But Op had accepted the term before and had not told the nephew their boundary had changed. All Op needed to do was talk to the nephew in private.\n\nI agree, but what I got from this is that while the boy was calling OP \"uncle\" and participating in the class, it was not a problem. When he was being rightfully called out, him calling OP \"uncle\" led OP to think the personal relationship was compromising the respect a teacher is expected to get from a student (maybe the boy would have just dropped it if it was any other teacher reprimanding him? the boy's friend who was also called out didn't seem to have said anything back to OP).\n\nI think the conversation should have happened beforehand, but I believe the issue here is not calling OP uncle, but how this could impact the boy's behavior in class.

We must do that to avoid the appearance that your familiarity with me gives you a pass on poor behavior. That was my oversight, and I own it.\n\nAddressing your disturbance in the classroom, I expect you to be a smidge more respectful of the rules. I also know you will stretch the boundaries; that is your job as a kid. However, when I correct you, be a man, own it, and do not go crying to your mother. From now on, she will address your behavior, and she and I will discuss any issues she may have in how I handle you ignoring the rules as a separate matter that will not concern you.\n\nOutside the classroom or a setting where I function as a school faculty member, I am your uncle.

However, I talked to him about this privately before it ever came up, so I do agree with your sister that you should have enforced that boundary early on and privately with your nephew.", "Mostly NAH.

The only person who is bordering ah for me is OPs sister, but I also wonder how the story was relayed back to her by the 13 year old. \"Uncle OP yelled at me in class today\" and \"Uncle OP calmly reminded me of his authority when I pushed boundaries in class today\" are two different stories that might invoke two different reactions.", "You\u2019ve clearly never met a 13 year old.

I also made sure to behave extra well in her class, so that she would never have to be angry with me and there would be no disruptions to familial relationships.\n\nEdit:  For people complaining:  Yes, every child is different, but 13 years old is old enough to think for yourself and have respect for others, like trying not to get a loved family member in trouble by undermining them and making their class unteachable.  If his parents weren't sure that he'd know how to behave, they should have been very clear about the line and potential repercussions before the first class themselves.  My point is that uncle should not have been the one who had to set the boundary, and certainly should not be branded an AH when the kid is the one who was abusing the relationship to get away with behaving badly.", "Our school calls all teachers by their first name, including the principal, so it might depend on context", "When my mom was my teacher at that age (small school/one teacher per subject) the kids thought I was fucking with her if I used her Ms. Teacher title.

It would be her responsibility, too, to make sure he follows that guideline. Like if he was any other teacher, and not her brother. \n\nIn the classroom, OP can't do much else than take him aside and say, \"In the future, in school, it would be better you say, Mr...\" \n\nIf the kid had wrongly addressed another teacher, it would be mom's responsibility too to tell him how to address the teachers.", "Right?

As a former teacher and someone who\u2019s been certified in adolescent psychology, the kid not only knew what he was doing, but he\u2019s being manipulative of the situation NOW in order to not have to face any consequences. \n\nShould a conversation had happened before hand? Probably. Is the child taking advantage of their parent? Absolutely. Ultimately whose fault is it then? Neither. Well - fault as in the sister being the mom who\u2019d rather ruin a sibling relationship than have a normal discussion with her brother about her child\u2019s misbehavior. Expectations could have been drawn or whatever, but the moment the mom showed that she was willing to completely absolve her child when someone else could be \u201cblamed\u201d for the kid being an asshole kid. Pushing the blame like this for your own 13 year old child just makes the mom look bad, because she would rather have a bad guy, than admit that their child participated in unruly and, ultimately, bad behavior. Is it the end of the world? Of course not. Could this be a pattern that will affect the child\u2019s psychology and ability to take responsibility when knowingly taking advantage of a situation they are face with that they know they can manipulate? Yes. \n\nUltimately- it feels like a family spat. But with far reaching speculation the mother is the one that is reinforcing a problem that has the potential to ruin her own kids life. You can\u2019t manipulate people as easily as you can family members, the kid is gonna be an asshole no one likes in general if they never learn to take responsibility in a situation- especially one where the kid didn\u2019t even face any repercussions- just got his feelings hurt (when he was acting in a way that he absolutely knew was bad and against the rules). \n\nCrocodile tears.
