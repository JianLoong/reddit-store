From our first class, he always called me Uncle (First Name), which didn\u2019t bother me personally, but then again, I was never in this position to teach anyone in my family before. \r\n\nLast Friday, my nephew and a friend of his were being disruptive during class, and I went over and asked them to drop it. My nephew started to reply using my name (\u2018Come on, Uncle\u2026\u2019), and I stopped him right there: \u201cI\u2019m your uncle outside of this school, here I\u2019m your teacher and you\u2019ll address me as Mr\u2026\u201d \r\n\nI said so because I thought it was important to draw this line, so he\u2019d respect me in this situation and see me as any of his teachers. Tonight, I got a call from my sister (37F) \u2013 his mother. She said my nephew came home from school upset and now she finally got out of him that I had told him not to call me uncle in school. \r\n\nI explained the situation to her. She says I should have explained things to him from day one, privately, instead of calling him out in front of the entire class. If I did, I would have set the boundaries sooner, and maybe he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable to misbehave in my presence.

It is best to set expectations early\n\nIt sounds like he was trying to get away with a bit of typical 13 year old behavior. All you did was ask that he use the more formal address while in school, but I don't think this is AH level.", "NTA \n\nWhilst you could have addressed it privately beforehand in the given situation your response was entirely reasonable", "YTA for how you handled this, but NTA for enforcing the boundary.  I speak as a former teacher.\n\nYour sister is right--you should have enforced the boundary from day 1.  On the other hand, it's not like you yelled at him, insulted him, etc.\n\nBut I would consider apologizing to him outside of school as his uncle and explaining the importance of the boundary to him.", "NTA.  Possibly against the grain on this one.  The kids reply of \"come one Uncle....\" is completely inappropriate and the respect for teachers needs to come from the kids parents.  Not the teacher, uncle or not.  13 is DEFINITELY Old enough to be cognizant of the respect required for a teacher and using the relationship of uncle to try and get away with misbehaving is a parental issue.  \n\nThat uncle called him out I believe is perfectly appropriate and natural consequences for the hlkids attempt.", "My aunty was a teacher at my primary school when I was little. I was always expected to call her \"Mrs\" at school. Unless we were away from other kids. But that boundary was set right from the beginning", "YTA. You allowed him to call you uncle in class until he was being disruptive and then used the correction as a way to put him in his place, since you admit it was to make him respect you in that specific situation and see you as his teacher, which is what should have been happening from the start. You should have discussed this kind of boundary with him before you ever taught his class a single lesson and your sister is correct in what she said to you.", "YTA. Your sister is right. This is a boundary that should have been explained to your nephew from day one. Not just dropped on him and then embarrassing him in front of others when disciplining him. You owe him an apology and an explanation, both done outside of class. As well as a promise that you'll be more aware of things on your end from now on instead of waiting for situations like this.", "NTA. It's true you should have set the boundary earlier, but your nephew was abusing his familiarity with you to misbehave so it was entirely appropriate to correct that. Mom is just mad her kid is upset.", "Soft YTA  \nI agree with your sister. You should have set the boundary earlier and privately. You also could have shut down the behavior without publicly undercutting your relationship. Instead of saying don't call me Uncle, you could have just reasserted the behavioral expectation and the pending consequence - as you would have for any other student.   \nYou should have been proactive, and in the absence of that you should have treated hi like an unrelated student.", "Does he call you Uncle on a regular basis? It\u2019s hard to switch what you call someone. I used to teach preschool and work in a daycare during the summers where the kids called all the teachers by their first names with their titles. (Miss Wanda, Mr. Bob, etc). When I later had these same kids in high school, it was already ingrained in their heads to call me Miss Wanda.", "NTA \n\nBut kids have different logic.", "NTA. I work with my mom every so often at an urgent care (we work for the same company but different locations, but sometimes I need to fill a shift so I end up working with her) her as a doctor and me as a receptionist/medical assistant. While I obviously call her mom everywhere else, I call her Dr. [our last name] while at work. It feels weird, but it would also feel weird calling her mom at work lmao. But it just feels more professional that way, and the same would apply in a classroom I believe", "Ah well, he will probably never call you uncle again and you have changed your relationship both in and out of school. You punished him by doing it in front of the class, but you never set the boundary before just went off on him in front of his friends. \n\nIt would be best for your sister to take him out of your class as you seem to lash out when you are angry (and you were angry). You had accepted the use of uncle in your class and instead of setting a boundary you lashed out in public. \n\nNot sure where you go from here", "Soft yta. She's right and I think you genuinely realize it. Should have had a conversation and set boundaries with him the moment you learned you'd be his sub so you could have avoided this situation in the first place.", "YTA. You were happy being called Uncle until you remembered you have to discipline him. The line should have been discussed with him before school started.\n\nI went to a small school district (about 85 people in my graduating HS class). I had one classmate who was in my science class in 8th grade with his mom as the teacher. He called her mom. Had other classmate with his mom as an aide in HS. He called her mom. Had one with a father as a math teacher her sophomore year. She called him dad. One classmate had an aunt as an English teacher. She called her aunt. \n\nIt's perfectly fine for you to set this boundary, but the way you handled it makes you the AH.", "YTA for calling him out in front of his peers but NTA for asking him not to do so", "YTA for calling him out in front of the class.  You should have taken him aside afterward since you didn\u2019t do so before.\n\nI agree it needed to be explained in general as it pertains to this situation but def a private matter that shouldn\u2019t have been done during class in front of all of his friends.  \n\nLive and learn, right?", "Good thing kids in Brazil will call any older person \"tio\" (uncle)", "NTA for the reasons. YTA for the way you handled it.", "YTA. You\u2019ll be his teacher a year, but his uncle forever. And you let him call you uncle until you decided it bothered you. I think this was a fail and you owe him an apology.", "YTA.  You probably shouldn't be teaching his class, because it crosses boundaries and is confusing to a kid.

I called out something naughty, cause she is my mum, and BAM. Growled at and sent straight outside, and then told off again outside. Its a valuable lesson. \n\nYou're NTA, but its a great piece of learning. Tell your sister you understand her stance and could've talked to him earlier, but its done now and the issue is resolved.", "I'm sure by now the rest of the class knows and you are his uncle so what's the problem?", "Congratulations. He probably won\u2019t call you uncle again, ever. And he knows now that you\u2019re willing to publicly embarrass him about a rule you never set in the first place. Don\u2019t teach his class if you can\u2019t handle it. YTA.", "She's not wrong that it probably should have been addressed privately. But since it wasn't, you can't travel back in time. I think you handled it the right way.", "NTA i tried avoiding my brother when he was my sub. He would usually avoid my classes too but I usually wouldn\u2019t address him at all but definitely not by his name.", "13 is old enough to know better, the kid is not 6.", "I wanna say NTA. My mom used to sub for my classes back in elementary school, and would openly correct me anytime I accidentally called her \"mom\", instead of \"Mrs...\"", "NTA", "My mom gave me a detention for not getting my interim report card signed. NTA.", "NTA he got called out in front of the rest of the class because he was acting up in front of the class.

Nothing wrong with that.", "My mother taught in my junior high school. My father taught in my high school.

My daughter was a student in the elective class I taught in college (I was the only person who taught it, and she took the course pass/fail).\n\nIn other words, I have a lot of experience with this kind of thing, and in every situation there was a careful separation of the family relationship and the teacher/student relationship right from the start. Your sister is completely right - she didn't criticize you for expecting proper behavior, she criticized you for not discussing expectations privately from the start. It's an important lesson to learn. You should talk to your nephew, apologize for your mistake in not talking to him about it beforehand, and reassure him that you have no hard feelings.\n\nMild YTA.", "YTA imagine not accepting being called uncle because it was used in a way that made you feel some kind of way but allowed beforehand because it wasn\u2019t an issue until then and your the one who ended up acting like a 13 year old in the situation. You need to apologize to your sister and nephew.", "Yes you should\u2019ve said something to him on day one. But at the same time he was being disruptive in class and I think is good that you shut him down the way you did.  TBH I think your sister is the real AH here. She\u2019s unconcerned that her son is being a brat at school, she just didn\u2019t want him disciplined in front of the class like any other kid.

Just make sure you talk to your nephew in private and give him a heads up on how to treat you at school, and maybe just a quick apology for not letting him know beforehand.", "You're not really an asshole, but as his uncle, you should apologize.\n\nYou made him upset and embarassed him, I think it would go a long way to talk to him and say you didn't want to make him feel that way but as the teacher you needed to do what you had to do.", "NTA your sister is out of line.  Your nephew was misbehaving, this should have been the focus.  Instead he managed to twist it.", "The mom is right though. After the first time, he should\u2019ve spoken to the child after class. \n\nSince he did not, the child thought it was okay to call him that - he is only 13 and kids develop differently, so it might\u2019ve not even occurred to him that it is odd. \n\nYTA - the first time OP told him to call him teacher should not have been in front of everyone", "I agree completely. \n\n\nMy dad was an elementary teacher, not at my own school, but relatively near my own school.  From the time I was in Kindergarten,  he told me before school started each year, that if I saw him on field trips or during the school day when there were other studentsaround, he was Mr \"Smith\", not \"Dad\".  Occasionally, it happened. I was a sensitive kid and because he explained why & reminded me regularly,  it didn't hurt.  It just .... was.\n\n\nOP, \nI have to say... you are the adult in charge.  You had foresight to realize you needed to be \"Mr ___\", not Uncle ____  because you were teaching your nephew's class even before there was a behavioral incident.  You could have privately talked or warned him beforehand.  He's 13 and no idea you'd correct him like this.  He's humiliated & embarrassed.  He'll live, but it would help the familial relationship to apologize a little. \n\n\nYTA.", "But Op had accepted the term before and had not told the nephew their boundary had changed. All Op needed to do was talk to the nephew in private. \n\nOp lashed out in anger in front of the class,", "I wholeheartedly agree.", "Wow catastrophising much?", "Disagree.\n\nImo OP fucked up by not setting boundaries regarding address in professional situations with his nephew, which is fine. First time. Now he knows better. He'll need to create a strategy for this situation if it happens again in future. That's to do between OP and whoever was his mentor/superior.\n\nWhen the nephew keeps currying favor with his uncle in a classroom full of his peers, it's important that the nephew AND the classmates know explicitly that OP will not tolerate misbehaviour from his nephew simply because the nephew brought the relationship into the conversation instead of heeding OP and stopping his mischief. Taking nephew aside would promote the illusion of favoritism and now nephew has the power to control the narrative and\u2014maybe this wouldn't happen but\u2014he could lie to his classmates to look cool about how his uncle let him off the hook and now it's OP's professionalism in question and his career on the line if one of those classmates had done what nephew did and told a parent leading that parent to call the school and complain instead of OP's sister only calling him because her precious little boy did nothing wrong.", "That is probably on the school not him. He has an obligation to substitute for the class when he's asked to.", "Kids develop differently. Its not crazy for a 13 year old to not know that your family has to be separated from work/school", "First day in any class the teacher introduces themself as Mr. Whoever. Unless nephew wasn't in this class on that day the boundaries were already set. \n\nAs for taking the nephew out to the hall after calling him Uncle would only appear as preferential treatment. Stopping it in the class set the standard straight that there is no nepotism.\n\nEdit: I missed the part when he said from the first day he called him Uncle, which was the time to stop it, which makes the YTA votes more appropriate. YTA for this reason.", ">But Op had accepted the term before and had not told the nephew their boundary had changed. All Op needed to do was talk to the nephew in private.\n\nI agree, but what I got from this is that while the boy was calling OP \"uncle\" and participating in the class, it was not a problem. When he was being rightfully called out, him calling OP \"uncle\" led OP to think the personal relationship was compromising the respect a teacher is expected to get from a student (maybe the boy would have just dropped it if it was any other teacher reprimanding him? the boy's friend who was also called out didn't seem to have said anything back to OP).\n\nI think the conversation should have happened beforehand, but I believe the issue here is not calling OP uncle, but how this could impact the boy's behavior in class. It hadn't up to this point, so OP never saw a reason to bring it up. (And if he's a sub, he might have thought he wouldn't be there long enough for it to become a problem)", "I don't read the events as \"lashed out in anger\".   I see the events unfolding more as reminding the teenager the roles in the classroom.  There was no mention of raised voices, yelling,  anything that implied anger", "Op's nephew was truly embarrassed in public, Op should have talk to him at the beginning of the term and in private.  Its not the fact that the conversation took place it was where and how Op did it. \n\nThe nephew will have this as a core memory with Op, its a big deal and Op will have to live with the outcome. The nephew was public called out in front of the class for doing something he has done before and its Op fault that he did not talk to the nephew in private.", "Yeah, you are probably right about that.", "Op should have done it in private as he should with any of his class, but he didn't he decided the day was the day and the moment was right and now he has to live with the outcome.", "it's not a reminder if it hasn't been stated beforehand."]}
