Seems disrespectful to the person doing you a favour. \n\n\nThe way I see it husband is TA for being controlling and confrontational, op for being petty and instigating this instead of just eating her pastry when they pulled over and continuing on, and the BIL for perpetuating/escalating the argument with husband.", "Also, who's she choose a pastry? The most notoriously flaky and messy option?", "i mean ofc her hands were shaking cuz she didnt had/ate any food but can walk to home, makes sense tbh.", "Not only that, but unless they were in a high traffic area, she would have gotten home faster in the car rather than walking.", "I used to suffer from bad hypoglycemia. When my blood sugar would crash, logical thinking was not happening. \n\nThankfully, I got some good advice from my doctor at the time about how to eat to avoid it (protein is my friend). The 4 hour glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes sucked though.", "Yeah, has no one else ever had a day where they had really inconvenient circumstances that made them not able to eat at ideal times? Or lunch wasn't as filling as they expected? Or they expended more energy than they accounted for? I don't even have very many of those days because I love food and prioritize having regular meals but it's become a clich\u00e9 in my industry that people \"forget to eat\" all the time. Apparently everyone on Reddit always takes perfect care of their health, though.", "Let me just eat a pastry all over your car... And crumb it up... And put my sticky fingers on the seats \n\nI bet you'll love it", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough info to blame the guys here. Were they in an unsafe area? Is it the middle of the night? Are they on the side of a highway? Clearly the brother was responsible for getting her home, that was their arrangement. If I\u2019m responsible for getting someone home and they throw a tantrum and refuse to get in the car, I wouldn\u2019t just throw up my hands and say suit yourself and abandon them. If something happened to them I would never forgive myself.", "Yeah, I'm surprised by all the comments who are implying this can only happen if you're in medical crisis and on the verge of death. I honestly don't even think of it as \"not taking care of my health\", I'm just not a breakfast person and also have a busy job. Truly that cannot be that unusual.", "I had an episode like this this morning solely because I didn\u2019t have time to make breakfast before leaving my house. \n\nIt is totally possible to experience all of these symptoms without diabetes or non diabetic hypoglycemia. (As someone who used to suffer from a particular ED - inspo boards for this ED usually include tips on surviving the nausea.)\n\nIf you don\u2019t eat for an entire day, there\u2019s no calories to run off of. You\u2019re gonna get sick. It\u2019s normal. Random, unexpected episodes of this like with diabetes sugar crashes are cause for concern.", "I get the impression she doesn't have a low blood sugar worry. Seems like she just wanted a snack. Which is fine and all. My wife can turn into a monster without food but it isn't an actual health concern. I just don't understand being so annoyed at the bil for accommodating her request to pull over. He seems super reasonable. Unless there's more to the story.", "She also says in another comment that she has no medical issue. It\u2019s just \u201cthis weird thing that happens when she\u2019s hungry\u201d. Meaning she shakes her hands so people drop everything and get her food \ud83d\ude02", "She didn't throw a tantrum, she decided to walk. \n\nShe didn't fight him, she didn't confront him or try to make him change his mind. Being mad is not \"throwing a tantrum\". It's on the BIL for not leaving her alone when she was walking.", "I think BIL is well within his rights to have rules for his car, though I personally think it is annoying when people are that precious about their car. But that's because idgaf about my car and use it as a roving trash can most of the time, and it's just not something I can personally imagine caring about that deeply .\n\n(I get that others feel differently, I obey the rules of other people's cars and say nothing, please do not respond to me telling me about why you are right to care about your car)\n\nBut I also think you're allowed to walk if you're feeling hungry & annoyed, and there is this weird patriarchal undercurrent to the idea that BIL and husband are fighting over her choices, like she's a child BIL was babysitting and not an adult woman.", "Before I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia, I almost hit someone when my blood sugar crashed and was extremely irritable other times it happened.\n\nWhen I had to do a 4-hour (I think) glucose tolerance test to rule out diabetes, I ended up walking like 3 kilometres to a specific bus stop, because I could not think of how to get home from the lab, despite taking a bus there before the test. My brain wasn't functioning due to the blood sugar crash post test.", "You would think that walking home alone would be a perfectly fine way of trying not to inflict your mood on others, but BIL didn't want to allow that.", "She did specifically say though that she decided to walk BECAUSE she was annoyed at the BIL. For him not wanting crumbs in the car, and still complying by pulling over. That's immature. Still within her rights though.", "It's starch and a lot of fat. If you are truly having low blood sugar, you need carbs Right Now. You can't afford the delay it takes to eat a pastry. Not to mention that the fats slow the digestion and release of the pastry down. That's why you get a sugar rush from 30gm of sugar as candy but not the same 30gm of sugar in ice cream.", "I mean based on the fact that OP apparently had enough energy to *walk home* even though she was so desperate to eat that she was shaking...\n\nI think she's full of shit either way.", "I find that proteins fix me up really quickly.  Eating sweet carbs is like throwing gasoline on the fire.", "Are you sure it's blood sugar related? I have the EXACT same problem - if I have caffeine without food, I get severely shaky and come close to blacking out. I also, from time to time, get an arrhythmia. My doctor diagnosed me quite some time ago with mitral valve prolapse, and suggested it had developed from a few decades of drinking caffeine daily.", "All good. Now BIL won't have to drive her anymore.", "We can question why we get angry, and we can work on underlying factors that impact our emotions. We can become emotionally secure to the point where we don't get angry because we were told no and offered a reasonable alternative.\n\nIf people weren't able to emotionally grow then therapy wouldn't work, and we'd all feel like it was the end of the world if we couldn't find our favorite dish on the menu (you know like a two year old). \n\nCut it any way you like, a person who is emotionally stable wouldn't need a walk over this.", "Yeah, \"I decided to just walk home **while I ate my pastry** \".\n\nWhether OP is diabetic, hypoglycemic, or just high metabolism, digestion doesn't differ. It takes 15 minutes for carbs to start to raise blood glucose. To be fair, there's probably sugar in the pastry but eating anything but pure sugar is going to slow the rate. So to go from shaking to the point they had to eat right away, to walking while you're still eating it? No way there's enough time for the pastry to raise the blood glucose to recover.\n\nI second your opinion.", "This sounds like reactive hypoglycemia! I have this problem after having a gastric bypass, but other things can cause it too, including fructose intolerance.", "Yeah, it is such a silly thing for them to go at her for. It really is.\n\nAnd to blame her for \u201ccausing tension\u201d or creating issues that her own husband caused by his own controlling tendencies is indicative of outdated ideals, in my opinion.", "You are the asshole. You can't control other people and if you are in their house or car you have to respect their boundaries. Plain and simple. Respect is a two way street. You should make this right.", "YTA, a dramatic one at that.", "YTA, it's not your car dude and that's a pretty serious over-reaction to how long of a drive? Short enough that you could walk it, apparently, so it couldn't have been that long. I get hangry, if you get that being hangry can make you a bit of a jerk. Fair?", "Imagine being a full grown adult but still acting like a toddler because you didn't get specifically what you wanted. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "If the distance home was walkable, it would have been a short enough drive for OP to wait to eat.", "> You were so desperate for energy, literally shaking, yet you were able to walk home to prove a point?\n\nExactly. And if you can walk home (30-45min walk) it means the car ride was like 10-15min. So somehow she had the energy to walk for 30 min but not not eat for 10?", "Yeah, thanks. Why couldn't OP just walk home if she wanted without two men freaking out over her safety?", "They're choosing to argue over something extremely childish. She's not forcing them to do anything", "Husband doesn't need to \"hold her accountable.\" She's an adult. She can choose to walk home. She definitely was showing she was angry with BIL and it's kind of understandable that he's hurt, but it also sounds like there's a bizarre dynamic here where both of the men are treating her like a child and arguing with each other over her care when the issue should be between OP and BIL.", "the car was stopped for them to eat. They threw a tantrum", "But how long did you wait before feeling that way? I only ask because I feel the same if I don\u2019t eat regularly and I have learned to prevent it.", "Tbf to the husband. He probably had to pretend to be angry otherwise she would just stir up some dumbass drama saying he never takes her side. She seems to enjoy drama", "Do you then walk for 45min immediately after?", "Because shaking hands that stop immediately after eating is textbook low blood sugar. \n\nShe probably has no diagnosis, because she\u2019s probably never been tested.", "I still think YTA but I have blood sugar problems like OP. They truly do go away as soon as you eat something. That part isn't unbelievable at all.", "Even in your example 'the boys' wouldn't be creating the drama. The husband would.", "If you're responsible for getting a child, or a pet home then sure. An adult woman is allowed to make her own choices. Take it from someone who is a woman who enjoys late night walks, nothing sends my temper out of orbit like someone else deciding for me what I'm allowed to do, like I'm a child. She's allowed to walk home if she wants to, and her safety is her responsibility to manage.", "It's also textbook whining about being hungry. She has been tested, check other comments. Nothing is wrong with her medically.", "Yeah, I agree with all of this. I don't think there's necessarily a contradiction between \"well within his rights\" and \"a bit of an asshole.\" Crumbs in a car are just so easily remedied. You can go to any car wash if you don't have a good car vacuum, which he might if he's so precious about his car.", "I don't see that as a temper tantrum. She walked home *while* eating the pastry. Seems totally reasonable. Was she supposed to just stand there next to the car? Nice day and a walk with a pastry sounds lovely.", "When you have the mental capacity of a 4yo yes", "That's what I was thinking. It sounds like OP was just trying to make an excuse to eat in the car and then got mad that her BIL wouldn't just let her eat while he was driving.", "Don't know why you're getting downvoted for this. I hate Reddit's predilection lately for acting like women are bratty kids, calling them \"spoiled\" or anything not perfectly pleasant they do a \"tantrum.\" \n\nObviously walking home was a sign of her displeasure and I could see BIL being a bit miffed that she's mad at him if he thought the boundary was reasonable. But if someone is telling you they're in distress from not eating and you can't handle possibly having to vacuum a few crumbs from you car, then you have to accept they might be annoyed.", ">The other thing is low blood sugar often leads to poor decision making, which is on full display in OP's behavior here.  We also don't know if she would have successfully made it home on foot (as opposed to getting confused and lost) if BIL hadn't stayed with her.\n\nThere's poor decision making at the moment, and then there's the continue refusal to admit wrong and apologise for what sounds like an event from the past."]}
