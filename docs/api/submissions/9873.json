Pastry isn't fast enough and fat slows access to the sugar.\n\nNow if you start to feel like you're going low but not scary-low then a carb is just fine because it takes a little longer but it gives you a more sustained supply. Everyone is different of course, it depends on what works for you.", "Could be a savory pastry? I get low blood pressure spells that can end in fainting and I need to eat something salty in that time to try and raise it up back to normal. My go to is chips but a salted pastry like a chocolate topping with flakey salt would probably do fine in a pinch", "I have frequent low blood sugar attacks, and while juice and hard candy help a little in the short term, stuff like cookies, muffins, and granola bars are the best bet for making me feel better.  I also know a few people who need protein like you, so it really varies from person to person.", "I keep roasted unsalted almonds around as a quick snack if I start getting shaky.  It's a horrible feeling and even if I'm at home, sometimes I won't realize I'm that hungry until it's too late so I grab a handful and make food.", "Hard candies are recommended for diabetics whose sugar can get really low really fast. The absolutely *would* \u201cdo shit.\u201d", "Everyone is different but all the diabetics I know, myself included, if we get low enough to get the shakes we're not walking any distance for a while. You are too wobbly to go very far without support.\n\nIt still doesn't seem likely for plain old hypoglycemia.", "You seem to fail to see that your willingness to be dramatic about things negatively affects others.", "OP never stated she was diabetic in any comments, in fact she stated she was not. Which leads me to believe she just got a little hangry and could not control her emotions. making her TA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "But could your husband stand upright & walk like this?", "So you were so hungry that your body was shaking from lack of nutrition and yet you were able to walk all the way home after eating a pastry? Nahhh", "Why didn't you eat before the car ride? And what exactly was the endgame here after he pulled over the car like you asked? Sounds like you didn't actually want him to pull over and he was damned if did and damned if he didn't.", "Im confused? Do you have a medical\nIssue such as diabetes or blood sugar?", "Shaking is not a big deal. Are you type 1 diabetic or insulin dependent? If not you body will soon switch to using your stored energy and you will recover. You might even burn some fat. Well done.", "Haha. I don't walk as fast as a car, I took the back roads that are closed to cars and I don't have to deal with traffic.", "Where can i get those tabs at? I bever knew it was a thing and get the shakes on occasion.", "I would have probably agreed with you a few years ago. Then my sister(20s) started having hypoglycemic episodes from nowhere. One minute she's working... The next she's fainted. She didn't recognize the precursors at first, but after 2-3 times was able to recognize a few and has to take immediate breaks to get something sweet. Twenty minutes has her slurring speech and dizzy, unable to walk, if she waits. It can make a big difference. \n\nIf it was happening a lot, yes she's an ah for not preparing something less messy, before getting in the car. If this is the first time she's had this issue come up at this time on a drive and that pastry is all she had - he's the ah for prioritizing his car over her health!", "I didn't make it up, I read it one of OPs comments.", "Ok we get it, you don't need to emphasize *everything* to get your point *across.*", "From the way events are laid out it really does sound to me like she is bringing it up and he is going straight for the jugular to nip it in the bud. It's something we have to do with my aunt every so often. Just shut her down hard before she can build steam.", "The fact that he immediately jumps to shutting down the conversation. Sounds to me like *she* keeps bringing it up and he is fed up. So far the track record for this post is as follows, he agreed to *her* fair compromise of pulling over when he doesn't want her to ignore *his* boundaries regarding *his* property and *she* was the one that refused to get back in the car, *she* was the one that acted like a brat and walked home. *she* was trying to manipulate him into feeling guilt, I've had girlfriends pull this exact stunt, I fell for it. *She* went complaining to his brother about *her* choices in what should have been a nonissue and cause a fight between siblings. Remember, this is OP's biased POV and she is going to (consciously or not) try to paint herself in a positive light and from what I can see, she isn't in the right any step of the way. If it were my SIL and I, it would have been a nonissue, she'd respect my boundaries regarding the rules of my car and I would have pulled over and let her eat and my bro would never know because neither one of us would have thought anything of it. Even if she did complain to him he'd just shrug and say, \"and?\" YTA OP start to finish.", "Yes, and that's obviously not carefully chosen words by an AH trying to not sound like an AH", "Ain\u2019t it obvious? The world revolves around them.", "She doesn\u2019t have to be, my husband isn\u2019t diabetic either, people without it can suffer from blood sugar spikes and lows too", "You can deal with hypoglycemia without being diabetic. Other medical conditions can cause it and so can certain medications.", "He could, he wouldn\u2019t feel his best but if he was physically consuming food it makes him feel better pretty quickly, plus the fresh air would likely help. Not saying it\u2019s the case for OP but walking outside and eating would make him recover faster than being in the car", "Sounds like she was just manipulating and trying  to get her way, which was to eat in the car. Then got mad when BIL called her on it and pulled over.", "Based on their vague cagey replies, I'm going to bet no.", "Yet you say he was following you asking you to get in the car? Are you making this up as you go along?", "Lol. You\u2019re so full of shit. \u201cBackroads\u201d. Lol!", "Any pharmacy has them even Walmart. You could even by them from Amazon. go to the aisle with the diabetic testing supplies and look for glucose tabs. You could always carry a small juice box too, or keep one in your car. \n\nIn Germany they had individually wrapped ones... loved them.", "The pharmacy. A pack of Lifesavers works too.", "Her comments imply this has happened habitually, and she doesn't claim to have fainted. \n\nMy comment may not be universal--sounds like your sister's having a difficult time--but I feel confident about it in this specific case.", "She never said insisted in her comments.", "Apparently I did. She was the instigator at every turn. Emphasis was needed to highlight that because a lot of people on here cleary missed it. Plus *I just like things in italics*", "It's kind of like she wanted her bf to be pissed at his brother...", "Up until a certain point we have to go the same route, which is when he kept telling me to get in the car, and then I took the back roads. I never said he followed me the whole way home. Sorry I didn't realise I had to explain every little detail.", "Thank you! I appreciate the heads up!", "So you were just being dramatic and bratty, refusing to get into the car after you finished eating? Because you were mad you didn't get to make a mess of his car?"]}
