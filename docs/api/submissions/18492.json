After telling them to save the day they have been telling us they want to get the 3 year old  baptized on the same day now. WTF is my initial reaction. My brother in law had 3 years to baptize this kid why all of A sudden do we need to pay for his piggy back and host his kid too. I find it pretty rude. They are a step away from asking us to put his name on the invite as well. Not going to lie I\u2019m pretty ticked that they always have to piggy back on our events. Why can\u2019t they do their own thing?\n\nMind you WE are paying for this and the after party food and drink with both sides of our family and friends. Not my in laws. My husband is always trying to please his parents and this is no different and brought up the topic a second maybe third time now after I shut it down once already.\n\nHis parents are always pushing the boundary. For example,  They insisted this child came to our wedding as a year old a couple years back so they could take the opportunity at our event to show him to all the family (local mind you) that hasn\u2019t met him because they didn\u2019t take initiative the whole year. We said \u201cno children\u201d across the board and they made a huge fuss about it. I gave in only for brother in law to come in the MIDDLE of church and then never show to the reception because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t figure out where to go\u201c that cost us $150 per seat. \n\nThey never came to our baby shower or gender reveal either after rsvp\u2019ing yes. \n\nThis brother, his wife and his son never come to any family events like Christmas, thanksgiving, Easter unless they are getting something out of his parents and that\u2019s the bargaining chip. Currently getting baptized is the bargaining chip for staying in the in-laws rental and it\u2019s even better they can piggy back on ours. They have skipped out on rent and trashed other family members rentals in the past. So not exactly responsible nor organized.\n\nSo with all this back info : \n\nAm I the asshole for holding my ground and telling them to no to piggy backing on our event we are paying for? \n\nWhy I might be the AH: Not cutting them a break, \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d I could show more compassion.", "created_utc": 1685385311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v2qyr/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_they_cant_piggyback/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My Church does group Baptisms once a month with however many babies requested that month.  It is a common thing.  If a compromise is possible, I suggest telling them you'd be wiling to share the party AFTER you receive the money for their half.  No money, no deal.", "Info: in your church, are baptisms on specific days of the year (once in summer, All Saints Day ex) versus a baptism scheduled by you of just your son? And does your pastor/priest ordinarily baptize children they haven\u2019t met/parents they don\u2019t know?

You are paying it is your say.", "NTA- but your problem is mostly your husband who refuses to set boundaries with his family.\n\nThese people are mooches. If getting their kid baptized was so important, I'm sure it can be done at minimal cost. Even if they were your favorite people in the world, they're not entitled to a free party on your dime; I assume they will have their own guests, upping the number of people and refreshments you need.", "While I agree it is low to try to steal a party, I would ask you also consider the purpose of this particular day.\n\nYour child is being baptized into Christ's Church...to be a member of the Body. A large portion of the teachings that come with it are about kindness...generosity...being humble...treating others as you want to be treated. Your attitude about not wanting another child baptized the same day, and then celebrating it as a family, is the antithesis of everything you are about to stand in front of the altar and profess...and promise to teach the child being baptized.\n\nBecause of that, I'm going with YTA.", "Agreed ^ this right here. Make sure that the church doesn't book them for the same time or the same day, and that the church knows that you won't be paying for theirs either. They sound like the kind of people who would claim that you are paying.

Or they know of financial hardships that are not common knowledge\n\nThe parents of the 3 yr old seem kind irresponsible for their past behavior, lack of attendance at your celebrations.\n\nStick to your guns.  These people have never been respectful to you.\n\nif you give in, they will know they can expect you to piggy back celebrations in the future and that you are a doormat to be walked over.\n\nNTA", "Think about what a baptism is, and if you want to keep that from someone else?  While I understand you don\u2019t want to share the spotlight, that isn\u2019t really what a baptism is about.", "NTA\n\nI think you have 2 options:\n1) tell them no and you default become the bad guy, or\n2) tell them you'd love to split the day and think it' a great idea...then tell them it'll be whatever half the cost of the party is and you're psyched about splitting! \n\n\"Oh this is so much better - we can get some great favors and more food options now! We start setting up the day before, so be at my house around 4pm to set up your side of the stuff\".", "NTA. They can have their baptism the same day burr dont share the party unless they contribute some money towards it. As a fellow Catholic, I know the requirements that must be met in order to baptize a child. Let them take care of things on their own and if they are not eligible to do it the same day as you then oh well.", "NTA. Do what others said and tell the church/venue this is only your child's baptism, and you are not paying for anyone else. If BIL/SIL and the child are present they may take over anyway. I would disinvite them.\n\nYour husband needs to grow a spine. Otherwise your kid will be second best as long as his parents live, and your child will know it.", "NTA.\n\nI might be biased because I have a huge problem with my dad\u2019s GF\u2019s grandkid who was born very close to my kid. (Okay I don\u2019t have a problem with the kid, I have a problem with my dad being a decent grandparent to that grandchild and not to my kid.) so acknowledged issues on my end. \n\nBut it\u2019s your party, your invite list, you\u2019re hosting. If the cousins were super close, or you were super close with BIL a double party that y\u2019all decided on could be cute! \u2026it\u2019s not that relationship, so it\u2019s not that party. BIL may not even want to baptize the kid.", "NTA this is a day for your child they can host there own for there child", "YTA. Is the point of a baptism really about the individual attention? Seems like if a baptism is important, then you'd want as many people to join as possible.

It really depends on that parish's policies.", "It\u2019s about the in-laws using OP so that they don\u2019t have to spend the money themselves. I really can\u2019t believe so many of you can\u2019t read", "Completely missed the point here. This is why nobody likes people from the US. \nYou glossed over the fact that the in-laws use OP and the doormat husband as their ATM, they\u2019ve had 3 (THREE!!!) years to baptize their child but now that OP is spending money to baptize her child and throwing a party afterwards she\u2019s supposed to be generous?\nAre you serious or do you need someone to help you with your comprehension homework from elementary school?\n\n(ETA: OP stated that they\u2019re all Catholic which obviously fits better than expected. They\u2019re all pretend Catholics and the brother in law is probably the golden child while OP\u2019s husband is the scapegoat. \nAnd I am allowed to bash Catholics all day, everyday. I used to be one. In Europe)", "Thanks for stating this so clearly.  I was in no way as eloquent as you on this!!!", "I agree with this one. According to the commonly accepted rules of this sub, refusing to share the baptism day and party makes sense. It just doesn't really fit with the point of the baptism being done at all. It's also quite possible that Op will have no say over whether the child is  baptized that day or not.", "OP and her husband paying for a party for someone else\u2019s child. Catholic baptism ceremonies for babies are major milestone events. Sorta like engagements and engagement parties, they only happen once and you have to pay for all the shit involved.", "Have you already started the classes? If so, BIL and SIL will just be told they need to wait for the next session, won\u2019t they?", "Well in this case he can only decide to make you or your bil happy, clearly not both or everyone. So who's he picking?", "Your husband is choosing to make you unhappy.", "You need to start seeing the bigger picture here my friend. Your husband is a part of the problem. \n\nNTA, stand your ground.

Now that they are doing it, itsa go for them too, FOH."]}
