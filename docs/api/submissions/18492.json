If this is primarily a religious ceremony about ceremoninally bringing people into the fold, then it should be the more the merrier. Instead, it's being presented as a private time to celebrate one person (not God). If this were a birthday party or a wedding, sure. This really comes down to the question of what is the operative element: is it the religious aspect (meaning it should be the more the merrier) or the private party aspect (meaning gate crashers aren't cool). Sounds like the religion part isn't as important as the party aspect. \n\nOddly, OP didn't say that costs would go up for an additional baptism (would they have to tip the priest per kid?). So, the issue isn't about additional cost, it's who gets to benefit from the cost. They just do not think that sharing here is appropriate, which again sounds way more like a private party than ceremonially bringing people into the Catholic religion.", "According to the post OP is paying for this as well as the after party and food and drinks for the after party.\n\nETA: for clarity", "My parents hijacked my cousin\u2019s baptism by adding on my little sister (who was older than said cousin). Do you know what happened? A lot of my dad\u2019s family stopped talking to my dad, because it was a gift grab on the behalf of the gate crashers (my dad\u2019s fam gave some money (not as much as my cousin got, because they had only budgeted for one child\u2019s party) for my sister because they were very uncomfortable with only celebrating the child they had actually been fucking invited to a party for while the other child was left out.). \n\nCatholic baptisms are a major milestone event where the child being baptized is being celebrated and given gifts, as it is the first step for that specific child joining the family\u2019s church. After this even, the parents of the child host a party to celebrate *their child* joining the Church. It\u2019s not like Baptist or other types of Protestant baptisms where multiple are done as standard practice. Each child is celebrated separately, hosted by the child\u2019s own parents. \n\nIt\u2019s not just the ceremony, but also the celebration afterwards. Imagine you\u2019re sewing up a graduation party for your child, and suddenly your sibling decides that since their child should\u2019ve graduated there years ago, they\u2019d rush a ceremony and want you to bankroll the party for their child by taking up half of your child\u2019s graduation ceremony AND party for the attention. This is OP\u2019s baby graduating from not being a member of the Church to becoming a member of the Church. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s just the church ceremony. They\u2019ve had three years to get their shit in order.", "Thats very odd.  Maybe she meant giving a gift to the priest.minister? Or flowers for the church? I've never heard of any church requiring a fee for a baptism.", "Maybe they need to pay to book the church?", "I have. Just like weddings and funerals. Some make money for the church that way and others pay the cleaners and/or pastor/priest for extra time and effort as well as extra utilities/incidentals (like toilet paper, hand soap, etc).", "NTA and screw the in-laws.  Get a security team, give them pictures and tell them to physically prevent BIL and his family from entering the venue.  BIL is sure to tell MIL and FIL, but it will be too late by then.
