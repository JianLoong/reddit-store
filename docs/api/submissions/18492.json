After telling them to save the day they have been telling us they want to get the 3 year old  baptized on the same day now. WTF is my initial reaction. My brother in law had 3 years to baptize this kid why all of A sudden do we need to pay for his piggy back and host his kid too. I find it pretty rude. They are a step away from asking us to put his name on the invite as well. Not going to lie I\u2019m pretty ticked that they always have to piggy back on our events. Why can\u2019t they do their own thing?\n\nMind you WE are paying for this and the after party food and drink with both sides of our family and friends. Not my in laws. My husband is always trying to please his parents and this is no different and brought up the topic a second maybe third time now after I shut it down once already.\n\nHis parents are always pushing the boundary. For example,  They insisted this child came to our wedding as a year old a couple years back so they could take the opportunity at our event to show him to all the family (local mind you) that hasn\u2019t met him because they didn\u2019t take initiative the whole year. We said \u201cno children\u201d across the board and they made a huge fuss about it. I gave in only for brother in law to come in the MIDDLE of church and then never show to the reception because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t figure out where to go\u201c that cost us $150 per seat. \n\nThey never came to our baby shower or gender reveal either after rsvp\u2019ing yes. \n\nThis brother, his wife and his son never come to any family events like Christmas, thanksgiving, Easter unless they are getting something out of his parents and that\u2019s the bargaining chip. Currently getting baptized is the bargaining chip for staying in the in-laws rental and it\u2019s even better they can piggy back on ours. They have skipped out on rent and trashed other family members rentals in the past. So not exactly responsible nor organized.\n\nSo with all this back info : \n\nAm I the asshole for holding my ground and telling them to no to piggy backing on our event we are paying for? \n\nWhy I might be the AH: Not cutting them a break, \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d I could show more compassion.", "created_utc": 1685385311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v2qyr/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_they_cant_piggyback/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be strong.", "NTA for not wanting to share the party that you are paying for.  However, you can't stop the Church from Baptizing both children on the same day.  My Church does group Baptisms once a month with however many babies requested that month.  It is a common thing.  If a compromise is possible, I suggest telling them you'd be wiling to share the party AFTER you receive the money for their half.  No money, no deal.", "Info: in your church, are baptisms on specific days of the year (once in summer, All Saints Day ex) versus a baptism scheduled by you of just your son? And does your pastor/priest ordinarily baptize children they haven\u2019t met/parents they don\u2019t know?

Your BIL and spouse sound like users. You folded for the wedding and it came at a cost to you. Not this time!

If getting their kid baptized was so important, I'm sure it can be done at minimal cost.

A large portion of the teachings that come with it are about kindness...generosity...being humble...treating others as you want to be treated.

Make sure that the church doesn't book them for the same time or the same day, and that the church knows that you won't be paying for theirs either.
