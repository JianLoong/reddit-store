Without getting into a lot of detail, she kind of kept her emotions to herself. When we drove back home from the hospital, it\u2019s was raining and past dark and we found a dog that was hit by a car on the side of the road, along with a puppy. The dog and puppy were both obviously gone, but there was another puppy nearby them. My wife instantly took him and cried and cried on the side of the road for what seemed liked an eternity. That was the only sad emotion I got from her during that time, and that was the last of it. \n\nFast forward to now, 4 years later and at Easter dinner tonight my niece (9) gave my wife a drawn photo of a dog and a baby wearing halos. She thanked her and asked what this represents to her. Niece replied that waffle\u2019s mom (the dog) and S (baby) were keeping each other company in Heaven, like how waffles and my wife keep each other company here, like it was meant to be. I guess I flipped, saying what happened with the baby wasn\u2019t meant to be, no part of it was suppose to happen and we weren\u2019t meant to lose our child to gain a dog. \n\nI got upset at my brother for even allowing her to gift that picture. Wife got upset and said that she liked the photo, and that waffles is meant to be in our lives, and thanked my niece and asked her to go play. \nBrother and I got into it, my parents got upset at dinner being ruined and my wife got upset for speaking for her, and that she had no problem with the drawing. I told her that it didn\u2019t surprise me because she didn\u2019t do much caring about it in general. \n\nI\u2019m just so upset that it was even a thought that the dog is a consultation for what happened. Like cool, my wife was able to channel her mothering with the dog, but what about me and what I lost? AITA?\n\nNeed to add that I didn\u2019t yell at my niece. I was just very upset and was angry, I didn\u2019t raise my voice I just told her that anything leading up to the situation and what happened afterwards, wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nEdit- I accept my judgement and that I need to do some apologizing. My head is a bit clearer now and I understand what I did was very wrong to my niece and especially my wife. We haven\u2019t had the easiest last 4 years, and sadly this wasn\u2019t the first comment I received about the situation. It seems when people find out how we got the dog and when, they try to make it a positive but have compared it to a lot of things I don\u2019t relate to, my co worker often mentions that it reminds them of the Tarzan movie and everyone takes it in a sweet way in which I struggle with.", "created_utc": 1681093867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h49q1/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_niece_and_her_dad_for/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't say I understand what you've been through. But neither does your 9-year-old niece. \n\nShe gave your wife the drawing with the purest intentions, and she said she liked it. That's all that matters. If you were upset by her wording, talk to her parents. But don't take it out on her.", "Holy shit YTA. \n\nLemme tell you a story. My baby brother died 10 hours after birth. I never got to meet him because I was only 8 at the time this happened. A few weeks later, I was playing with one of my baby dolls and I gave him my brother's name. My stepmom flipped her shit and I didn't understand why because I thought it was nice to name a baby I could hug after my little brother. \n\nAs a 40 yr old adult can I now understand how that might have been hurtful to my stepmom? Sure. Can I also see that your niece is attempting to empathize and find a silver lining to a very dark cloud? Hell yes, I can. The fact that you would even suggest that your wife doesn't care about this baby is rather heartless of you. Maybe she's simply not interested in having to prove her grief to you. It's not a competition, who's hurting worse. \n\nShame on you for yelling at a child. Shame on you for being cruel to a grieving mother. Do better.", "YTA. Your niece is 9 and clearly has a better understanding of what Waffles means to your wife. You said yourself she cried for \u201cwhat seemed like an eternity\u201d after finding the dog. Losing a child in at any stage is so incredibly hard, but your wife found some sort of comfort from the drawing. She doesn\u2019t need to talk about it to still be struggling.\n\nA dog is no replacement for a child, but you don\u2019t get to police anyone\u2019s grief, just like they can\u2019t police yours.\n\nEdit to reiterate: your niece is 9 and was doing something she thought was nice and was in fact appreciated by your wife (the intended recipient). She\u2019s *nine*.", "Why are you taking your anger out on a nine year old? YTA", "YTA. It sounds like your wife has processed her grief but you haven't.", "YTA You blew up at a child for no reason, she's fckin 9 and didn't mean anything maliciously. You've also accused your wife of being an emotionless robot, because she wasn't offened over nothing like you, and didn't immediately sob after giving birth to her stillborn child, which I'm going to bet is possibly more traumatic for her given she carried the baby and gave birth. \n\nEver think that maybe your wife didn't react emotionally to the loss because you either don't acknowledge it, or you immediately make it about you? If you're hurting over the loss, go to therapy like a responsible adult instead of scaring a 9 old because you make problems out of thin air.", "YTA. I am sorry for your loss, however it was in no way appropriate for you to yell at your 9 year old niece who was trying to do something nice. You were way out of line and your niece deserves an apology from you. I highly recommend you seek counseling as this type of reaction towards a child is not normal and really should be addressed.", "Obviously YTA for yelling at a kid for trying to understand things way beyond her comprehension and for telling your wife she doesn't care about losing her child.\n\nMore importantly, though, I think your wife being so closed off about all this was hard for you in ways that maybe you did't realized or that at least you haven't talked to her about. Maybe you didn't have anyone to talk to about this in the way you needed to. I completely understand how triggering unresolved trauma could cause you to lose your shit in such an unfortunate way. I hope you can use all this as a launching pad to start working towards some closure, ideally with your wife but definitely for yourself.", "YTA - im sorry, but she was 9. Yelling at her was in no way appropriate especially for what to her, was something nice she was doing. Also the way you spoke to your wife was in no way appropriate", "YTA. Go get therapy.", "YTA.

You ought to try talking to her about this topic, really talking to her, instead of waiting until things like this crop up just to sling poison her way because she didn\u2019t mourn the way you thought she should have. \n\nIt may be worth talking to a professional if you\u2019re this upset four years afterwards. Zero judgement, just an honest suggestion. Carrying that kind of anger with you isn\u2019t healthy, and isn\u2019t likely to just \u201cresolve itself.\u201d\n\nBest of luck, honestly, and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.

Y 1000% TA. You yelled at a young child for making a child's rationalization for a silver lining on a tragic event - and not only was your wife (the person who still had to actually give birth) not upset by how your niece approached it, but YOU INSULTED YOUR WIFE about how SHE chooses to express or not express how SHE feels about losing a child?! Being upset over the loss of your child, of course, is completely valid. Having a difference of opinion from how your wife sees it--while able to lead to friction, as here--also valid. But your reactions to everyone involved were AH moves.", "YTA. Your niece tried to give your wife a kind gesture and you blew up at a 9 year old girl for poorly wording what the gift meant.", "YTA.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t saying you losing a child was meant to be in order to gain a dog.\n\nShe was saying that since you lost a child AT LEAST there was something good that came out of it - saving a dog.\n\nJeez. She 9.\n\nGo to therapy.", "YTA.\n\nThe picture was a lovely gesture. I'd be touched. Your niece is nine. She's going to say things that a nine year old would say. You know fine well that she wasn't trying to be malicious, as kids that age are generally quite innocent. \n\nHowever, what upsets me most is what you said about your wife, that she \"didn't do much caring about it anyway .\" That is a LOW blow and completely unfair. She lost just as much as you did. Everyone has their own way of coping/grieving. Your wife's way is to keep those feelings to herself, and yours is to yell at children. \n\nListen, I am truly sorry for your loss. I can't even imagine what you went through, but you've got some stuff to deal with. Maybe see a therapist or join a support group, if you haven't yet. My trauma isn't the same as yours, but it still helped. You owe your family an apology. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry for your loss. Lastly, Waffles is a great name.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like you are still hurting very much from the loss of your child, but please don\u2019t take it out on your niece and family.", "Yta, seriously how dare you scream at a little girl and deflecting your emotions into her?  She's trying to show she's being thoughtful, she doesn't understand at that age how horrible it is what happened. And WTF is wrong with you for saying that to your wife?  Not everyone processes grief the same way, she obviously immediately found coping skills with waffles, you need to find your own. I internalize all of my pain and grief because that's just what I learned to do in life. I cry when I'm alone, which is a lot since I work from home. I can't believe you would actually say that to her. She carried that child, she birthed your baby, she did all of that work. As a man you don't need to stay strong like society says, but you need to get grief counseling to deal with your emotions instead of blowing up on your wife and a little girl. Not gonna lie, if that were my and my husband said that to me, I really don't know if I could ever put that behind me... Maybe you both could go to grief counseling together, but 100% apologize to both. Especially your niece, because she's going to remember this for the rest of her life.", "YTA.  Your grief does not give you the right t abuse a child or your wife (or anyone else).", "YTA for speaking to people that way. Especially your wife.

Three miscarriages here. I was sad and numb, but cried only on the 3rd when told our twins lost their HB. I never lost it, though. Maybe because of the shock to my system. Maybe because I always had hope. My husband may have been stoic the whole time, but I knew he was also hurting. Different people deal with trauma and loss differently.

Do you actually believe that a mother who loses her child is not grieving?  If so, you are delusional. She grieves forever but is processing her grief maturely.  You need therapy. You also need to apologize sincerely to all but especially to your wife.", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife suffered a horrible loss and I can\u2019t imagine the pain you both went through, but you had absolutely no right to treat that child the way you did!! That drawing was sweet! She\u2019s 9 and she showed more empathy in that drawing than you, the adult! \n\nEveryone grieves differently. You had no right to accuse your wife if not caring! You have no idea of what she feels of that loss. Just because she doesn\u2019t walk around showing her emotion does not mean that she doesn\u2019t feel. \n\nYou flipped out in a 9 year old child on behalf of your wife when she didn\u2019t need you to do that! It would be one thing if she acted upset with your niece, but she didn\u2019t. I think you are still grieving and haven\u2019t dealt with it in a healthy way and what you did was project that grief on an innocent child and then you scolded your wife, in front of your entire family because the way she grieved wasn\u2019t acceptable to you! Work out your thoughts in therapy, not to a child. \n\nApologize to your wife for trying to control her grief, apologize to your niece for taking it out on her and to your brother as well and get help for your grief.

Please apologize to your niece.", "Your niece meant no harm. She doesn't understand that this would be upsetting. She's just a kid and thought this was all right.

I hope you can see a therapist to help you work through these feelings and trauma. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "OPs wife carried the child inside her body, and then had to be told that the child she\u2019d been growing and keeping safe inside of her had no heartbeat and oftentimes there is no explanations or reasons why it happens. To top it off it was a still birth\u2026 \n\nAnd op expects her to break and show emotion when he himself hasn\u2019t stated if he did or not. Nowhere in his post did he say he grieved - yet his wife did by breaking down on the side of the road next to two deceased animals and one surviving one. He didn\u2019t say if he helped or comforted her either, like.. that had to have been a heartbreaking sight right after losing her own child. \n\nThen OP chooses present anger as his grief and chose to yell at a child, he also spoke for his wife when she didn\u2019t want him to and then he berated her for not being sad enough? Is she even safe to grieve around him I wonder?", "This.", "OP also owes his wife an apology for judging her own grieving process", "I did mainly blow up on my brother. I didn\u2019t raise my voice at my niece, I just told her that no part of this was meant to be or meant to happen", "Thank you, I get that now. \n\nIt\u2019s not been easy, she bonded with waffles super quickly and kind of got upset when I tried to. So it\u2019s definitely been a her dog situation. \nWe went to therapy for a while there, but she wanted to stop going and move on. I\u2019ve thought about going back by myself, but she gets upset. \n\nIt just feels like it\u2019s always been something that was swept away. I know people grieve in different ways but it\u2019s like as long as had the dog as a bandaid, nothing else had to happen or to even involve me.", "I did grieve, we went to therapy together. She didn\u2019t go to the funeral, she didn\u2019t want to name the baby (both of our family\u2019s wanted a proper burial) and when I tried talking with her she shut me out.\n\nI didn\u2019t scream at my niece, I might have worded it wrong I lost my patience and sternly told her that no part of this was meant to me. I yelled at my brother, not her.", "Agreed. I forgot to address that. Glad you did. Everyone grieves differently.", "She is NINE years old and was trying to do something sweet. You took it as a negative and even malicious thing.  Plus it was a gift for your wife, not you, and your wife had no issue with it. And because of that you attacked your wife and her feelings about the stillbirth.", "She still wouldn't understand that. She's nine. Kids don't think adults. She's thinking like a kid and this makes sense to her. \n\nI know you're still grieving, but step back from this. Please. And get some grief counseling, it would help.", "You need to go back to therapy.", "The funeral is for the living, maybe she didn\u2019t want to see a child sized casket or urn cause that would be too real for her? And naming the child would have also been very very real. \n\nMaybe in her mind she felt like she did everything she needed to do, the rest seemed like it was mainly for you. \n\nSome people prefer to grieve quietly, especially when it\u2019s very very very close to home. \n\nYou may not have yelled at the kid but you did yell at her father, yelling can be heard and children have ears. The drawing wasn\u2019t meant for you - it was meant for your wife, who loved the picture. It meant something to *her* and you soured it with your own feelings. You took over your wife\u2019s grief and made it your own.", "Yet, in your title you state that blew up at your niece. Which is it?"]}
