I'm feeling quite torn about it, and I'm not sure if I handled the situation the right way. Background: I'm a 40-year-old single dad, and I've been raising Sarah since her mom passed away a years ago. She's my everything, and I love her to bits. Lately, though, I've noticed that Sarah has been putting on some extra weight, and it's been a concern for me.\n\nYou see, I struggled with my own weight and body image when I was younger, and I don't want Sarah to go through the same difficulties. But I also understand that talking about someone's weight can be a sensitive issue, especially with teenagers who are already going through so much. \n\nHere's what happened: Last night, we were getting ready for a family gathering, and Sarah picked out a dress to wear. As she put it on, I noticed it was a bit tight on her, and that worried me about her health. Without really thinking, I jokingly blurted out, \"Sarah, maybe you should consider losing some weight. That dress looks a little tight on you.\"\n\nMy heart sank immediately when I saw the tears welling up in her eyes. She rushed to her room, refusing to come out for the gathering. And to make things worse, some of my relatives who were there criticized me for my comment, saying I should have been more understanding and supportive.\n\nThey were probably right. Maybe I should have approached the situation differently instead of jumping straight into the weight issue, but I still do genuinely care about Sarah's health, and I worry about her well-being. Even though I realize now that my words may have hurt her more than I intended. I guess I'm wondering if I'm really the jerk in this situation since I didn't have any bad intentions when I made that comment.", "created_utc": 1691185793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15id1zs/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_lose_weight_which/", "score": 139, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would that comment have helped you? Yeah, it wouldn't have. You know it would have validated all of the toxic horrible things running around inside of your head. Multiply that by five, since your daughter is female.\n\nThat sort of comment is why I had anorexia as a teenager. I almost died. I permanently stunted my growth and damaged my fertility. And I never got lower than a size 0 and never had a flat belly, so plenty of people kept telling me I was too fat even as my hair fell out. You want to risk that for, what, to avoid a kid that is bit chubby? Come on.\n\nTeenage girls go through a lot of weight fluctuations until their early twenties, because their hormones are going nuts. The same reason their periods can be irregular for a long time can also drastically spike and then depress their metabolism. All the while, they are faced with relentless pressure to be *dangerously* and *unrealistically* thin in a way that most of them simply do not have the genetics to be, not even with all of the hard work in the world.\n\nLook man, experts and doctors have not figured out how to get people to lose weight and keep it off. Ozempic is the closest we've got to it and nobody knows if it will keep working. You're just a layperson. If you're concerned with her health, take it up with a doctor. Don't just blurt out stupid things like \"hey, you, teenage girl, why don't you do the thing that medical experts haven't figured out how to do yet unless it involves injecting crap into your thigh that costs $1200 a month?\" That's not helpful.\n\n**Edit**: OP elsewhere says that she's 5'9\", 17 years old, and weighs 170 lbs. That means her BMI is on the lower end of normal. He thinks she should weigh 125, which is borderline anorexic. Good job risking giving your daughter an eating disorder, OP. Lest I remind anyone, without treatment, 20% of people with anorexia will die. Let's risk giving your daughter the most deadly mental disorder outside of suicidal ideation because we did not bother to do any research. Google is free.

She would make playful comments about our chubby bellies, and should we be eating that? Etc.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nHi, so to keep things brief something happened recently between me and my teenage daughter, Sarah. I'm feeling quite torn about it, and I'm not sure if I handled the situation the right way. Background: I'm a 40-year-old single dad, and I've been raising Sarah since her mom passed away a years ago. She's my everything, and I love her to bits. Lately, though, I've noticed that Sarah has been putting on some extra weight, and it's been a concern for me.\n\nYou see, I struggled with my own weight and body image when I was younger, and I don't want Sarah to go through the same difficulties. But I also understand that talking about someone's weight can be a sensitive issue, especially with teenagers who are already going through so much. \n\nHere's what happened: Last night, we were getting ready for a family gathering, and Sarah picked out a dress to wear. As she put it on, I noticed it was a bit tight on her, and that worried me about her health. Without really thinking, I jokingly blurted out, \"Sarah, maybe you should consider losing some weight. That dress looks a little tight on you.\"\n\nMy heart sank immediately when I saw the tears welling up in her eyes. She rushed to her room, refusing to come out for the gathering. And to make things worse, some of my relatives who were there criticized me for my comment, saying I should have been more understanding and supportive.\n\nThey were probably right. Maybe I should have approached the situation differently instead of jumping straight into the weight issue, but I still do genuinely care about Sarah's health, and I worry about her well-being. Even though I realize now that my words may have hurt her more than I intended. I guess I'm wondering if I'm really the jerk in this situation since I didn't have any bad intentions when I made that comment.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Nah, it's perfectly cool that you bodyshamed your daughter to tears. No notes.", "Yeah you're a GIANT AH. You struggled with your weight and don't want her to have those issues, congratulations you gave her a whole new set of issues. You said it in front of people making it even worse. I understand being concerned about her health but what you did was mean and from her perspective came from the person who is supposed to love you  know matter what.", "YTA for saying it, and YTA for lying about your motivation - it had nothing to do with her health, that's just how you rationalize it", "If you were really that concerned about her weight, you could\u2019ve offered to take her to a pool or go on a walk.

She was already probably having those. And it is probably grieving wt. gain. People get it after someone close passes. And doing it in a more private setting would have been better. I get your concern because it was abnormally quick but she is also having her hormones all over the place and most likely still grieving the loss of her mom.", "Don't put your shit on your daughter what the hell is wrong with you. Maybe she's growing, maybe the dress shrunk in the wash. As a female I can tell you right now you just fucked her up for life and she will forever think she is fat and be insecure about her body.

An eating disorder could really harm her (my eating disorder stole my teens and twenties, honestly.) \n\nSomething about food/ body image goes so deep in people. I don\u2019t understand it.

It led to other things I won\u2019t mention.  \n\nOP, apologize to your daughter.  And never do it again.  If it helps, I\u2019m at a better place with my father.

I\u2019ve also never again been able to simply eat what I want when I\u2019m hungry.\n\nThis comment may continue to torment your daughter when you\u2019re dead and gone.

I'm not sure how heavy Sarah actually is, so idk if it's really a cause for concern or not. Either way, what you said was very rude, and you should 100% apologize to her. Instead of calling out her weight, maybe encourage healthy habits. For example, you could go to the gym and ask her if she'd like to tag along with you.

A good weight is for age AND HEIGHT, not just age.   125 might be reasonable if she was 5'2\", but at 5'9 140 is perfectly healthy.   Talk to your pediatrician before you make any bigger mistakes.\n\nSecond, you commented on your daughter's weight when you were getting ready for a family gathering **with other relatives present**, compounding the embarrassment factor.\n\nYou need to apologize to your child.

I kept my mouth shut,  was supportive and when things opened up again and be was able to go to school in person,  play sports,  etc,  the weight came off.  \n\nIf you struggled with your weight, you'd know this was a dick move.", "YTA. Come on man. Wasn\u2019t a joke and you know it.", "YTA. And the fact you're having to ask on Reddit whether or not YTA makes you even more TA.\n\nI suggest you get some help yourself on dealing with this.

Did you ever stop to think that your daughters weight gain may be a depressive reaction to a traumatic event like say a mother dying?  Of course not, she's just fat.  You better hope that child eventually forgives you because right now as soon as he's old enough she is gone and you will never see her or any future grandchildren.  Apologize like your life depends on it, and it does.  Emotional abuse counts as child abuse and you AH are an abuser.  You need therapy, your daughter certainly needs therapy to deal with death if her mother and living with an ass like you and you need family therapy.  Don't put your insecurities of your own body image on her.  Man up and think before you speak.\n\nETA \" my words may have hurt her more than I intended\".  Just exactly how hurt we're you trying to make her?  Why would a living father be intentionally trying to inflict emotional on his daughter?  She needs to get far away from you and now before what you say to her pushes her over the edge and then you won't have a daughter just another cemetery plot to visit.", "YTA- That much is obvious since you didn't approach it with sensitivity or respect. I do find the dramatic \"Someone killed themselves because of one comment like that\" responses a little too much. This was one comment and hopefully as a parent you'll do better in the future.", "Sounds like dad is projecting weight issues onto his daughter. Get your own therapy OP and if your daughters clothes look tight maybe think about getting clothes that fit her body since she is a developing child rather than trying to make her fit into a piece of cloth.

But thin people also have these conditions. The statistics about excess death come from studies primarily done in 1999 and 2004. Analysis in those studies assumed that if more obese people than thin people died in a given year, the excess death must be due to obesity.  That is to say that when someone thin died, it could be for any number of reasons, but if someone obese died, it had to be from obesity, not age, smoking history, etc.  \n\nThe 1999 study indicated that obesity was responsible for an excess of 280, 000 deaths per year, US. The 2004 study stated 400, 000. Stanton Glantz, director of UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education put the number at 100,000.  The CDC, using different methodology, in 2005, came up with the number of excess death as roughly 25, 000.

Does he think it somehow reflects badly on him or what\u2019s the problem? It honestly does not sound like her health is his main concern.

Plenty of people go to extremes to lose weight for their \u201chealth\u201d, but I\u2019d say often that\u2019s not really what fueling that belief because society is so effed up when it comes to beauty standards. But these extremes often include starving themselves and overexerting their bodies. On top of all of that, weight loss isn\u2019t a behaviour, it\u2019s an outcome of other things that are actually behaviour.
