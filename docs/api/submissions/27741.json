Can you work through a split of financial contribution/domestic labour split that you can both agree to with a therapist? That would be a last ditch effort, but only if you really want to make it work. That includes a discussion around the lifestyle that you are both interested in for your family. What does it take to get there? The answer isn't you working yourself to the bone while he isn't contributing financially.\n\nWhile I am not particularly fussy about where the money comes from that he contributes to the family I would be unable to respect a spouse whose grandma was paying their bills like this.", "Sounds like you got a fun boy problem. Well of course you NTA but I mean he had always been like this. Did you honestly not considered this before having kids ?  Where you hoping you could change him ?

That\u2019s setting him up to fail because it takes time to find work, let alone at the wage he needs, and make sure the nanny or other childcare is available. Your frustration is understandable, but it\u2019s not fair to keep moving the goal posts.

He doesn't really sound like a great partner to you either... this must be a really stressful situation to be in.

If he starts working, it will not mean more free time for you. It will mean you will have to do the household he cannot do. \n\n\nHe is selfish for his unwillingness to discuss how his inheritance can help the family. He wants to keep all money to himself and doesn't see how it affects everybody.\n\nIf you inherited money: would you add it to the household income? Or keep it separate?

Yes, it seems like your roles are reversed where you are the breadwinner and he is the house husband however, since you already work a full time job and needed to take on another side job to make ends meet, he should have stepped up and taken on the side job instead.

Do you love him? Do you want to be in a relationship with him? If so, get yourselves to some counselling. Threatening divorce is not a good way to live. Just tell him you want to try and reconcile your differences rather than separate.\n\nCaring for kids full-time is also work. \n\nIt's just a thought, but I think what you should try is to explain to him that he must find some way to make up for the income that you will lose as a couple from the weekend job you are giving up.

Your argumentation is flawed because his issues (which he had when you married him) run deeper than his inability to provide.  He's broken on levels that need to be fixed before he can tackle getting a decent job.\n\nHe's the primary AH here.  He needs to grow up and man up.  Don't concede that he doesn't have to be an equal partner in the home.  He needs to be involved with the kids.  He needs to be involved with caring for the home.  It's not all on you.
