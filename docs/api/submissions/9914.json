It is not easy or possible to put such a facade for so long. \n\nDuring her wedding preparation she got carried away. In our huge but closed knit family being obedient and soft spoken is a huge virtue. None of us are allowed to talk back to elders. She was just that kind of girl.

They are all used to her being submissive and cant handle not even a little of her push back. They overreact to even mild demand from her and attempt to make her submissive again.\n\n2.) Simultaneously, she has zero experience of being assertive and overdoes a lot of it. She demands they treat her the way they demand she treats them.

Friends of the bride and groom camped in the field and swam in the sea The barn looked beautiful decked out in paper flowers, with hay bales around the walls and miniature white twinkly lights everywhere. We had pre-drinks in another friend's yard. Then a horse and trap took bride and groom to My OH mowed a giant heart on the lawn and they shared their vows under an old wooden swing frame bedecked with flowers, while a friend played the violin. We cooked and served a 3 course meal for 70 from a cottage kitchen, and partied into the night...the well literally ran dry at one point but that's another story! The event was full of love and it was a gorgeous, memorable day. A few weeks later, we were looking at photos in our local pub when an acquaintance came over to see.
