I told my bridesmaids, whatever goes wrong, I don\u2019t want to know about it. I had the best time at my wedding. I wish I could go back in time and vacation at my wedding. The entire process was so relaxed. My parents thought weddings were so fun  and easy until my younger sister became a stressed out storm cloud planning her own wedding. \n\nA wedding\u2019s purpose is to get married, not to put all this pressure on yourself and others to throw the perfect, huge, expensive party. People lose sight of that. The arguments and fights planning a wedding can create long lasting problems, as your SIL found out the hard way. She still hasn\u2019t learned.\n\nYour SIL is probably not a bad person. In fact, she might avoid confronting how her own behavior led to a schism because she thinks admitting it was her fault makes her a bad person. It doesn\u2019t. It makes her a flawed, unique, constantly evolving and hopefully improving person like the rest of us. \n\nIf you have that kind of a relationship, you can tell her that letting herself get caught up in stress does not make her a bad person or label her forever. Everyone messes up. But she needs to be the one to reach out to the people she alienated, make amends, and heal the rift.

Start with I'm so sorry that I upset you.  I did so in anger which I should never have done.  Your wedding was so grand.  I know it was more expensive than ours.  We simply chose to have a less stressful wedding because we didn't think we were up to the intricacies of planning something bigger.  We were happy you were there with us.  We chose instead to have a relaxing and, what to us was, more expensive honeymoon.    \n\\[End of apology, follow with distracting discussion like this example\\]  \nWhat's amazing is the range of differences in how people celebrate their marriages each in their own special way.

She obviously has not learned her lesson - as she got nipped by family for ass hole behavior during her wedding and still trying to show her tail about someone else's wedding.  Girl needs to learn how to be quite and not comment on things that are not her business.

All of the extras, bridesmaids, groomsmen, flowers, catered meals, dance, etc are above and beyond what is required and can be had or not, depending on what the bride and groom want.  Your wedding was just as valid as hers, and it was your choice. Big fancy church weddings with high price receptions do not make you any more married than informal back yard weddings. Not having to worry about paying for the unnecessary extras also makes your marriage less stressful because you don't have to worry about paying off that huge expense for the big day.", "I agree that would have been more mature, and better in many ways, but spoiled narcissists aren\u2019t going to respond to maturity.

She is already hurting and I just put salt to her wound.\n\nYep, she's feeling the justifiable consequences for *her* actions, and yet somehow, it's up to *everyone else* to make her feel better about it?  Sorry honey, but that's not how that works.  If you want to feel better about it, face the facts, proffer **genuine** apologies to everyone (see below), and do what you can to fix the clucksterfluck **you** created.\n\nSince SiL is apparently blissfully unaware of what an apology constitutes, here is a primer for OP to show to their brother:\n\nThe three parts of an apology that are necessary before forgiveness is possible:\n\n* The person who wronged you must **sincerely apologize** for their transgression (sincerity means that they do it with no expectations of forgiveness, no excuses, no attempts to blame you, no \"I don't understand why you are upset\", no getting angry if you don't respond the way they hoped you would),\n\n* They make an attempt at **restitution** (for monetary things this is simple, for non-monetary sins, it is more complicated, but it should be something that helps the wronged party to feel whole),\n\n* They find a way to assure you that they would **never do anything close to that again**, because they *understand how monstrous their actions were* (this must be done in a way that you find convincing...a mere promise is often not good enough).\n\nHaving taken all those steps, it is then *up to the wronged person* to decide if they accept the apology and forgive or not.  Further rounds of introspection, apology, restitution etc may be required.  More time may be needed.  They might *never* be ready to actually forgive and forget.  And that's their right.  You can't *make* someone forgive and forget.\n\nAnd having done it with one individual, rinse and repeat for Every. Single. Person. and incidence where the bridezilla offended.\n\nIt's not up to OP to ask / demand an apology, because a forced apology generally means nothing.  SIL has to realise that she is the root cause of the problem and choose to address it.  And until such time as she does, she's going to have to continue living with the ongoing consequences of her behaviour.\n\nThere is only one person who can fix this, and it isn't OP, or even her brother.  They can lay down boundaries and consequences, but SIL is the one that has to actually do the work.", "I think your SIL got her perspective skewed. She was so laser-focused on creating the \"perfect\" wedding by social media standards that she threw her genteel upbringing out the window and was rude, controlling and basically OFFENSIVE to many of the people one would assume were important to her. All in an effort to get her own way - a bridezilla indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> ...one cousin being cut out of the photo because he had injured his leg and couldn't wear formal shoes  \n>  \n>...Aunt ridiculed when she showed her attire for the reception and called a despo overaged actress on red carpet,  \n>  \n>...my mom being shouted at for being not wanting to put her hair in bun   \n>  \n>...SIL even went so far as to tell her best friend who tolerated all her temper tantrums \"don't even try to be smart with me and upstage me. Won't be good for you\n\nif that is just a sampling of your SIL's over the top behavior then she has probably permanently burned bridges. Years of goodwill down the drain in one event.\n\nINFO: Did she pull any of this garbage with her parents or siblings? Has she also burned bridges with her own family or just her ILs and friends? \n\nAfter reading all this, my best guess is that she launched  her latest attack because of this statement:\n\n>As I was talking to mom about how happy my grandma was on the day of my wedding,\n\nI suspect  that in her heart of hearts  she knows how disappointed everyone was with her behavior at her wedding, so she felt the need to mock your old-fashioned, unscripted, but joyful wedding. Because, of course, no one has dubbed you persona non grata for acting like a Bridezilla.\n\nI wonder how many of the details of her out-of-control behavior are actually fresh in her mind and how many things she's glossed over? By now she probably thinks everyone is just being mean to her and holding a grudge. \n\nIn one way its a shame that there wasn't some videographer following her around and recording the wedding day like on a reality show. She would then have to face her own behavior leading up to her wedding. Plus it would no doubt go mega viral because it is so cringe-worthy.", "The color of love", "Thank goodness I live alone.
