I'm surprised she had any friends to begin with. Congrats on your wedding and hopefully long happy marriage.", "Nta. If anything she owes you an apology. So what if the wedding didn't have a theme or any of the other stuff she was spouting. It was an incredible day for you and your partner and that's all that should matter and she should be happy for you. Not trying to drag you down about it. To me your wedding sounds like a wonderful time. It honestly does sound like you reply to her was a long time coming and don't apologise for putting her in her place.

If your SiL was so concerned about not having friends, she would stop alienating people.", "NTA. Don't you dare apologise to that woman. Your brother ran face first into a wave flagging bullet.

The people that love you are supposed to hold you accountable when you\u2019re in the wrong, not placate you. You could apologize for saying things that were hurtful, yes. Try to come from a place of understanding. People don\u2019t act that way for nothing, what is her story? Did she have a difficult childhood and feel like she needed to have the perfect wedding to prove something? She could use a little humility and if she\u2019s a good person she could grow from this, and maybe you could both learn more about each other and find some common ground. There\u2019s something deeper happening here.", "NTA. If she can dish it, she gotta be able to take it. Maybe now she\u2019ll think before she speaks.", "NTA. I mean she started it. She saw that coming and your brother knows it too.", "NTA, she asked for it. She has no one to blame but herself.", "Maybe instead of crying about it to her husband she should pick up the phone and try to apologize to those she offended. If the subject is that bothersome to her that that it  makes her cry then its probably something she thinks about often and regrets. The best way to alleviate those feelings is to try to make amends.   \n\nShe set herself up perfectly for your response so maybe next time she will think before speaking. NTA", "NTA.  Your SIL learned nothing since 8 long months later she\"s still using her wedding to alienate the few family members who still talk to her.  You put it in stark terms she can't ignore.  Last chance for her to stay connected to her husband's family.", "This is one of those situations where I don't think you're TA, but I do think you should have just left it alone.

I have known this girl since kindergarten. She is really a nice girl that is why my family welcomed her with open arms. In fact we used to think my brother got really lucky to have her. It is not easy or possible to put such a facade for so long. \n\nDuring her wedding preparation she got carried away. In our huge but closed knit family being obedient and soft spoken is a huge virtue. None of us are allowed to talk back to elders. She was just that kind of girl. She still is, but I think her wedding experience just made her bitter.", "I totally agree. I cold have handled it better.", "Thank you! \n\n Yes, the more I think the more I am convinced that I should have handled it better.", "She is not a mean person as far as I know. She is just bitter because she is facing criticism for some decisions she took while her wedding preparations that has left people hurt.", "We know her since childhood. She is a very decent and nice person. Never hurt a fly.  Just got carried away during her wedding preps and trampled relations by being extremely stubborn.", "Thank you for the blessings.", "She had a pretty normal childhood just like me and my brother. She was a girlie girl since childhood. Fairy tales and Barbie and pink sheets and covers kind of dreamy girl. We thought it was natural for her to have a desire for a dream wedding. \n\nAlso she had no elders besides her parents in her life. She has no concept of dealing with them. She is generally  soft spoken but doesn't have a concept of when to keep shut. I have 2 sets of very active grandparents, and 7 sets of uncle and aunts with 28 cousins in all age ranges. So it's a huge family and she has no idea how to deal diplomatically with this many people.", "I realize that. She is the part of my life now, my family does not deserve this kind of feud between SILs. I hope this doesn't go out of hands to the level where people have to choose sides.", "NTA.

I wonder what switched with her. That\u2019s weird for someone to just change all of the sudden like that.", "I can understand lashing out like you did because the things she was saying were very rude and disrespectful. I wonder if part of it may have also been jealousy that you managed to have such a happy wedding day without all the drama. I hope all your family can resolve things and make up with her soon as it sounds stressful! Heaven forbid anything goes wrong at the wedding \ud83e\udee3", "NTA\n\nI had a small wedding very similar to yours. It was low stress and amazing, and if anyone had a snide remark even remotely similar to that of your SIL, I\u2019d be pissed too. \n\nIt seems like she needs to know about her behavior and how it\u2019s affecting your family. Your brother protecting her is not helping the situation\u2014 if anything it\u2019s enabling her to continue to burn bridges.", "Nope, NTA. Your SIL is still being rude and there's no need for it. \nCongratulations on your marriage, OP! Your wedding sounds like it was a blast!xxxx", "NTA. SIL wants to dish it out. Got served back to her. Too bad. The good news is, since no one wants her around, you won't have to see her too often.", "NTA\nDO NOT APOLOGIZE. Sounds like SIL has a lot of apologies to make to everybody for treating them so badly. She obviously thinks she's the star of every show if she had to make comments on your wedding and pictures, but your family know better. Let her be sad about her behavior, that's her problem not yours.", "NTA. Sounds like SIL can dish it but can\u2019t take it. And you brother is in the tight spot because he didn\u2019t tell his wife to pull her head in & behave civilly to the people around her. That\u2019s on him- not you.

He fucked up marrying that woman but that was his choice to make.", "NTA if you don't want people to cut you out for being an asshole, don't be an asshole.

She can't play victim and act like her \"\"\"\"\"perfect\"\"\"\"\" wedding was so amazing that it was worth ruining all of her relationship.

Your brother\u2019s judgement is highly suspect and I wouldn\u2019t invest too heavily in his opinions where his wife is concerned. He watched this woman drop a nuke on his family and did nothing to stop it. Now he\u2019s mad at you for commenting on the fallout after his wife instigated yet another conflict with her unprovoked, unwarranted criticisms? If your brother wants to be her glass bottom boat, that\u2019s his problem. You should take a cue from your grandparents and aunt and minimize all contact with SIL.", "NTA. Naaa she's your brothers problem let him handle it. Good job junior, marrying that monster.", "Info. Please explain in detail wat she did? Because I think you are leaving it out on purpose.", "NTA. You nailed it.", "Really, she sounds super fucking jealous of you and mad at herself that she went for making her wedding social media worthy and stressed herself and everyone else the fuck out rather than just...letting herself do what made her *happy*.", "When they go low we go high doesn't work. Especially with shameless assholes.", "Yes. Op stated that in her family being soft spoken, obedient are considered virtues. You are not allowed to talk back to your elders. \n\nI consider myself a decent person and I would not put up with this nonsense from my husbands family", "Info:\n\nNow I am curious. What where the disagreements about? Like I get that the \"respect your elders no matter what\" is cultural and what have you but what was said? Like there is a difference between wanting the wedding to be accessible for elders or wanting to read out of Mein Kampf.", "Whoa! What she said was not nice.\n\nHowever, there is a lot going on beneath the surface. Being obedient and soft spoken is a virtue? So being loud and having diverging opinions is frowned upon?  No matter how \u201can elder treats you it is not allowed to speak against them? Not even when planning your own wedding?\n\nMaybe you and your family at the toxic ones and she is frustrated as she realises what this means for her.  Who is to say that the requests she made are \u201cunreasonable\u201d outside of what sounds like a cultish or very narrow religious point of view?\n\nMaybe she is acting up because she does not want this for herself yet does not know how to escape.\n\nEdit to add YTA A", "She was not being obedient and soft spoken who OP has stated is what is expected in her family", "Can you give us some examples maybe as to what those disagreements were like?"]}
