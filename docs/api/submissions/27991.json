It's a stupid move, like trying to appeal to people by pretending you like things you really don't (like pretending you are really into fishing or supporting a certain sport you actually detest, to use less politically loaded examples, to try to appeal to more men).

THAT BEING SAID, point out that the conditioning of society beauty standards runs deep, and if she\u2019s having problems finding a partner that will be empathetic to that, then maybe it\u2019s just a matter of finding a different route to go when looking for a partner. I would gently suggest that she merely start being more forthcoming about it from the get-go\u2026 (perhaps posting it in her dating profile). The men who find that superficiality a deal breaker will weed themselves out, saving them from wasting their time OR hers, and she\u2019ll have a clearer view of who the quality guys are who can look beyond that superficial aspect.

Assuming it went down like OP said, it sounds like she wasn\u2019t trying to be malicious or cruel, just trying to offer some advice. And frankly the fact that her friend jumped straight to \u201cgah you\u2019re the type of people that are the problem!\u201d makes me wonder if she makes it her entire personality. Obviously she\u2019s not wrong one bit for being against the patriarchy, but if she\u2019s the type to launch into full tirades about it on the first date then that could also be a contributing factor.

OP can also let their friend know that they don't want to keep having this conversation over and over.", "I agree and I'd add that if you vent about the same thing numerous times to the same person, you are implicitly asking. IMO you can only unload on people about the same thing so many times before it becomes an emotional burden for that person to keep their thoughts to themself.

It would be one thing to say that men may be being put off by her body hair and help her set expectations. It's another to say she should shave to attract somebody.

You can tell a friend \"a lot of men might have not shaving as a deal breaker, so your dating pool is going to be lower, it sucks, and you could maybe try shaving\" or you can tell a friend \"men aren't dating you because of your leg hair\" - two totally different ways to handle the same honesty. One shows compassion for a friend's views, other stomps all over their views.", "OP makes no indication that the friend has often complained about this-which doesn't mean that isn't the case, but I would think OP would mention it if this was something the friend frequently complained to her about.

I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who views me as their oppressor because of how I was born.

I should have clarified further, I also think that friends and loved ones can classify as people being 'perfect for you.' Anyone who pushes you to be your better self while still loving you is the person you're supposed to be with, that could be romantic, platonic or familial. I also know people who are more satisfied being a parent or giving back to the community than in the pursuit of love.

If hairy legs are allowed, then they're allowed. That's not my workplace, which is why I don't wear skirts", "yeah, it's super internalized misogyny. also the basic premise is like, so silly. she doesn't need to make herself attractive to all the men in the world, she needs to find the guy that works for her. that guy won't care about body hair. \n\nOPs friend is just describing dating experiences that happen to everyone, attractiveness aside...", "I still remember the SCANDAL when Julia Roberts had hairy pits out in public.", "To say nothing of what it does to your employment opportunities, particularly if your talents lie in the arts.

I know some people wax their arms but I thought that was the one safe area where women were \u201callowed\u201d to not wax.", "I went to flight school and we had to wear a pilot uniform.
