THAT BEING SAID, point out that the conditioning of society beauty standards runs deep, and if she\u2019s having problems finding a partner that will be empathetic to that, then maybe it\u2019s just a matter of finding a different route to go when looking for a partner. I would gently suggest that she merely start being more forthcoming about it from the get-go\u2026 (perhaps posting it in her dating profile).

They were discussing her dating life and she seemed confused as to why she was getting rejected, so OP offered a possibility?", "How is \"some people don't like body hair\" ignorant and sexist?", "I agree completely. I hate the feel of body hair on myself,  even pre- puberty with the baby hairs. I couldn't wait to be old enough to shave. I would never suggest anyone, though, alter anything on their body they didn't want to or weren't comfortable doing. Also women aren't the only gender that shaves. I know plenty of men who trim, shave, and even wax to keep themselves looking neat and show that they care about their appearance as a point of pride.", "This is exactly it - what matters more to her, natural appearance or a relationship? That\u2019s the real question she needs to decide.\n\nI also feel like the way OP presented this - as a neutral question and not a statement that detracts from Emily\u2019s appearance - is key too. OP just raised a possibility. Emily took offense to that and seems to have overreacted a bit in the process. NTA, OP.", "Even with men who don't mind body hair, a lot of them have their limit, y'know ? Even women are not equal in how they grow body hair. Some have rather thin, blond hair that aren't really that obvious, and some have thick dark hair that are instantly noticeable. Some grow a bit on legs, pubic area and armpit, some grow stach stuble, arm hair or even chest/back hair. And I do think that most men who don't mind body hair will still draw a hard line there.\n\nAnd sadly, according to OP's description, I would tend to think her friend is on the more obvious side of body hair growth.", "OP doesn\u2019t say the friend asked for advice. Sounds like she was venting.", "Also let's face it, there's a big variation in \"hairy\" that OPs friend could explore without feeling like she's giving in to the patriarchy. I suspect hairy armpits is where most men would draw the line but a bit of leg stubble and a neatly trimmed bush would probably be okay (especially if the men have been in long term relationships before and know that there's times where their womenfolk really can't be bothered to shave their legs and leave them for a few weeks).\n\nPersonally I find my armpits smell worse if they go too long without a shave (still use deodorant of course) so if OPs friend is having the same issue then that can't be helping.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to see a \u2018YTA\u2019 comment. OP\u2019s friend is comfortable in herself and her body and does not conform to society\u2019s standard of \u2018beauty\u2019 and I applaud her as she\u2019s everything I aspire to be. OP pointed out about her body hair and that could completely destroy everything that made her feel comfortable in the body she\u2019s in. I also hate the entire society standard of men wanting women to be BALD all over, which is essentially what pubescent girls look like. It\u2019s gross. Body hair is normal and no one should be ashamed for what their body naturally looks like.", "If the venting is tiring, she can stop hanging with this friend or just change the subject. The friend made a deliberate choice to stop shaving because she didn\u2019t want to support the patriarchy. That friend is undoubtedly aware that lots of men don\u2019t like body hair. It doesn\u2019t really need to be stated unsolicited.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of guys who actually don\u2019t mind when women don\u2019t shave. Depending on how the friend is meeting these men, she might just be going after the wrong type of guy.", "If the friend had asked for advice, this would absolutely be a NAH.", "\u201cDo you think it might help you a little to shave?\u201d Is not the same as \u201cNot shaving decreases the size of the dating pool to those that do not care if their partner shaved.

I am here for you if you ever need to vent\u201d", "Well the point of the matter is that she can\u2019t find any of the men that don\u2019t mind copious body hair.", "'OP didn't just make an unsolicited comment about her friend's body hair.'\n\nBut she did\n\nFriend didn't say - men won't date me due to my hair - if she had said that maybe you're right but you assumed as did OP, that body hair was the deciding factor here.

Her body hair is a valid reason as to why she probably wasn't getting asked on second dates, and OP was simply stating something that could be the issue.", "it's about understanding gender socialisation and why women in some cultures are expected to remove body hair (and in others they are not)", "It could be that other people are telling her the same thing OP is saying.  She might not want to accept this as a factor.  If everything went great on the date and then they don\u2019t ask for another date, is almost what else can it be.  Shave or dont shave is her choice but she shouldn\u2019t be surprised that people don\u2019t ask her out again.  I have seen or heard about to many men that like hairy women among the people I know.", "So your suggestion is that she ends the friendship rather than being honest?", "We actually don't know if that's the point of the matter. Maybe she's actually a super shitty person and the people she dates pick up on it. We're only getting it from OP's POV", "made it up", "Your point being?", "Because most women don't treat each other like thaf", "I don\u2019t really see how the gender matters and don\u2019t really look at it I wrote he cause as a French speaker I use he as default", "how do you know that?  just projecting.", "I gave two suggestions. I don\u2019t understand why some people don\u2019t get that being honest isn\u2019t always necessary. She didn\u2019t ask for her friend\u2019s opinion.

Plenty of women police each other\u2019s appearance.", "Men are men. They have something against body hair. I'm a woman and I know how men work and it's unfair to us, but it's a fair reason. OP's friend has a lot of amazing qualities but it is a possibility that the body hair is what's ruining it. I'm not saying that I know why she isn't getting asked on dates, but OP just offered a possibility.", "Some people don\u2019t want to hear people talk about the same thing over and over again.
