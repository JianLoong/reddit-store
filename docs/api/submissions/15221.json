Both me and Layla are married, I to \"Pam\" (29F) and Layla to \"Greg\" (30M). Me and my sister had a grandma who sadly passed away when we were in high school. Since we are both married and both plan on having kids, the topic of names came up and we both said we wanted to name a child after our grandma, lets say her name was Victoria. We didn't really fight about this per se and just agreed whoever had a daughter first could use the name. About a year ago Pam got pregnant which was very exciting. We found out it was a girl and did a gender reveal where we announced we were going to use the name Victoria. My sister was not upset about this and jokingly said something along the lines of you beat me to the punch. A few weeks after this my sister announced that she was pregnant.\n\nSadly, late into the pregnancy Pam miscarried and lost the baby. This was incredibly difficult on us and Pam suffered especially bad, both physically and mentally. My family has been there to support us but we have asked Layla to give us some space as seeing her pregnant is a lot for us at this time. While she was upset about this, she understood. Recently, my parents threw my sister a gender reveal party similar to the one we had for Pam. My Mom convinced me and Pam to go and we felt we were in a good spot to go. We get to the party and all is great until we get to the gender/name reveal. The way it was going to work was Greg's family was inside the garage holding a banner that would be pink or blue and say the babys name. When the garage opened me and my wife were shocked to see a banner that said \"Welcome baby Victoria Greg's last name\". I asked my sister WTF and she said since we weren't using the name its only fair she should get to. My wife started sobbing and I took her to my car but not before telling my sister she is an evil human being who doesn't deserve to be a mother. Now my Mom is mad at me because Layla also has a high-risk pregnancy and this was very stressful for her. Most of my family is saying I should apologize for what I said. AITA?\n\nETA: I think people may be confused about this and this is my fault for using the wrong words. When i say miscarried, my wife gave birth to a stillborn. while our daughter was never alive, my wife gave birth to her, it was just too early for the baby to live sadly. Our daughter is buried in a grave that says Victoria, which I think is part of the reason I was so upset", "created_utc": 1681953521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sh43e/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_gender_reveal/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not until/unless they experience it themselves. Even then, some brush off the heartbreak. This little fact explains \u2014 but not excuses \u2014 the utter cluelessness of these people. \n\nBefore my mom was conceived a little girl named June was born to my grandparents. She died an hour or two after she was born. They called her a \u201cblue baby\u201d which could have been any number of heart or lung problems back then.  Her memory was kept alive by my grandparents and then by my mom. Now by me and my siblings. This was nearly 100 years ago. I share this because I want you to know, OP, that these little ones can and should be remembered. Not everyone forgets them.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. It\u2019s truly heartbreaking.", "NTA. She knew how bad this was and assumed once she did a big public show of things, you would just suck it up. She sounds terrible. Please send her a link to this AITA, I feel like she needs a few hundred people telling her she\u2019s awful.", "Holy shit NTA. I'm so sorry that is one of the worst things I've seen on here lately.", "NTA.", "NTA!!!!!! Your sister is a horribly dense person.  Nobody with half a heart would do this.  I\u2019m so sorry \u2764\ufe0f", "your sister is the worst kind of person just saying. your mom is even worse. they should have had you come to find out this way.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your sister is though. I can\u2019t even phantom her thought process", "NTA.  Your daughter, though not here now, was still the first granddaughter.  That was her name.  Expecting you to not mind a niece running around with the same name as your late daughter is unrealistic and your sister, with any empathy, would see that.  There are other ways she can honor your grandmother without stealing the name off your daughter's headstone.\n\nI'm so, so sorry for you and your wife's loss.  Please be kind to yourselves and each other as you grieve.", "NTA. Your choice of words was spot on, she\u2019s an evil human being for naming her child after your stillborn. I hope she eventually finds about this post and realizes what a piece of human . she is.", "NTA, your sister is selfish and heartless", "I have two cousins on the same side of the family with the same name. They aren't named after anyone in particular. No one cares and it isn't a problem. You don't own the name.", "NTA, while you all may not have had to opportunity to know Victoria, the love and bond you had is real, and it is so insensitive (for lack of a better word because it\u2019s so much worse than just being insensitive) for them to do all this.", "NTA. You buried Victoria. Its more than a name, it was your child. How does she not see how callous this is? And you didn't ruin a damn thing.", "I'm so sorry, Victoria's Dad, for the loss you and Victoria's Mum have experienced. You are most assuredly NTA.", "NTA, I lost a child a few days after birth and I would never speak to a family member who used their name, especially so close to the loss.", "Definitely NTA. I can see why your sister named her future child (to honor y'alls grandma) but she did it without any regards to you and your wife's feelings, knowing that you guys had to bury your own baby, who was named Victoria first, so soon after she was born. It's fucked up and the fact that your mother is mad at you guys for reacting negatively is almost as bad. You and your wife had every reason to be upset at and chew your sister out. \n\nIt would have been different if she and her husband had discussed it with you guys first and possibly said they wanted to honor your baby and your grandma. But sadly people are selfish like that...", "I understand why ya'll are upset, I had my stillborn at 38 wks. My brother had my neice 2 years later and named her middle name my daughter's name. When he told me the name they chose, I cried with happiness. Mind you, I said 2 YEARS, not a few months later when the grass hasn't even been able to grow on her grave! NTA by a long shot!! But your sister and family?! Yeah they can go you know where, the insensitvity bc it wasn't their daughter who suffered the loss is abhorent and absolutely disgusting!!!!", "I thought this also, this child was actually born. When I started reading I was assuming I was gunna go Y T A, but definitely not. The child WAS born, it just sadly wasn't alive. This is awful, I cannot imagine how they must have felt when the door was lifted.", "I thought this also, this child was actually born.

This is awful, I cannot imagine how they must have felt when the door was lifted.", "I don\u2019t think not having lost a child, had a miscarriage, giving birth to a stillborn, etc excuses the sisters actions. Most people on Reddit judging won\u2019t have gone through one of those, and we can still see how wrong that is for the sister to name her daughter the same name as her sadly deceased niece.", "I don't think my Mom knew. She seemed shocked by the name, in addition my Dad has said my sister shouldn't have used that name and I think he would have told me if he knew and I highly doubt my Mom knew but my Dad didn't", "NTA.  I am utterly dumbfounded and appalled by your sister\u2019s lack of care.  You and your wife had a baby daughter named Victoria.  The name \u201cVictoria\u201d is on her grave.  Good Lord you two have suffered enough, I can\u2019t believe your sister would be so cruel as to use the same name, without consulting you, so close in time to your loss.  And to have it be revealed like this?  I can\u2019t even.  \n\nAnyone who tells you to get over it?  Ask them how  they\u2019d feel if for the rest do their life at family gatherings they\u2019d have to hear their deceased daughter\u2019s name be called out.  Hear about \u201cVictoria\u2019s\u201d milestones on a close timeline to when your daughter\u2019s would have been.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you if you never spoke to your sister again.  It\u2019s that bad and heartless.", "My answer is NTA, but I also want to assure OP that what was said in the moment was 100% deserved. Anyone who knew about this name beforehand is also immensely fucked. \n\nThis was a pre-meditated action, with no regard for OP or OP's wife. This is fucked up beyond belief. OP's daughter has a grave with her name on it. \n\nI am appalled. I wish you the best moving forward. For me this would be a NC kind of consequence.", "Agreed I had a relative that was named after their parent unfortunately a sidling that died before they were born was as well. They always went by their middle name. To the point were not everyone in the family was aware of their given first name definitely, not good for the expected child.\n\nOp NTA", "And go NC with anyone telling you to get over it or apologise.\n\nNTA, what sister did is entitled, selfish, disgusting, cruel, disrespectful and probably a lot more unpleasant words that I am too pissed off to think about.", "Thank you for pointing out how disappointed Grandma Victoria would be, because that\u2019s super important. You\u2019re not \u201chonoring\u201d a loved one by being an AH to the point that they would be ashamed of you.", "Same. That is some cold ass shit.", "I\u2019m so petty I\u2019d snap a photo and send it to her if she hasn\u2019t seen it. Send it daily.", "yep The issue isn't the sister wanting to use the name, it's how it was revealed to OP that is insensitive to OP's an their wife's pain. Even just a small 5 minute phone call getting their blessing would be all it took.", "The baby was born and is buried with the name Victoria.", "The baby was stillborn, not miscarried, the sister is an evil human being and doesn't deserve an apology.", "Read the edit", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcaf", "OP\u2019s baby is dead. So the name Victoria will constantly be a reminder of their dead daughter that they had to bury.  The sister should have discussed this before the party", "It's pretty fucked up for his sister to use the name of his dead baby. She was born and has a grave with her name on it, and while no, people don't own names, naming your baby after your dead niece is really cruel and super messed up. It's not just the grandma's name anymore, and this isn't some situation where she's honoring the dead baby. \n\nNow they have to watch this child grow up with the name of their dead daughter. Sure, he had a visceral reaction, but who wouldn't in this situation? I would have lashed out in the heat of the moment as well.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf", "^", "Did you read the edit? This wasn\u2019t a miscarriage. It was a stillbirth, and there\u2019s a gravestone for their daughter with the name Victoria.", "And sis wasn\u2019t malicious by having a banner with the name of OPs dead baby? Weeks after said death?", "She doesn\u2019t own it but her dead and buried daughter did, as that\u2019s the name on her death certificate and gravestone.", "So was the sister who dropped it on her brother that she was naming her child Victoria and saying that OP wasn\u2019t using it. They BURIED their Victoria. OP did use the name", "His wife gave birth to their dead child (it was premature birth, and the baby died before leaving her womb) who's buried with the name Victoria on her grave. His sister is totally the AH.", "Read the edit, his wife gave birth to the baby, it was a still birth and they buried the baby with the name of his grandmother.", "The edit explains that the baby was full term and buried as Victoria.  \n\n\nETA I've also miscarried and no rainbow baby for me.  \n\n\nIn my view, the sister was out of line.", "The baby was stillborn, and buried with the name Victoria being on both the baby's grave and death certificate. Sister named her baby after OP's very real, very named dead child. How could they be the AH for that?", "Tell me you didn't read the post without saying you didn't read the post. Their daughter DIED. She won't be going by Vicky or Tori. She is buried in a grave with the name Victoria on it. Normally, I'm with you. Cousins can have the same name and go by nicknames. But this situation is different.", "They just buried their daughter who died in the womb and was still born prematurely. Of course they wanted some time away from pregnant sister. Also niece is gonna get to grow up and learn that her cousins death certificate and grave has the same name.", "They buried their Victoria. Instead the sister was callous and said that the name wasn\u2019t used. OP had the first girl. Unfortunately, Victoria died.", "Be for real, they're naming their child after op's child who died, it's a horrible and stupid thing to do.", "I don\u2019t think you read the post correctly.", "You say that like if it was just a miscarriage then he would be the asshole", "Yes. I don\u2019t have kids and I haven\u2019t experienced a stillbirth. It\u2019s still obvious to me that what the sister did is fucked up. Insanely insensitive.", "Maybe your dad should tell your sister that. \nNot that I think it would do any good. \n\nShe knew it was wrong and that\u2019s why she never said anything to anyone.

How exactly is it honoring your grandmother to provide you and your wife with fresh pain at every baby milestone? \"Victoria's first birthday, you have to attend!\"......log onto Facebook \"OH look, Victoria's first lost tooth!\".....\"Victoria got engaged, so excited to see her walk down the aisle!\". Given the late stage of your loss, these events would likely continue to cause pain for DECADES to come, even if you and your wife later made peace with the idea. Your grandmother would likely be rolling in her grave to hear the pain that her namesake would be causing. Your sister's actions tarnish the intent behind the name....especially because she did not bother to broach the topic with you in private so you and your wife had an option on whether to attend.", ">Ask them how they\u2019d feel if for the rest do their life at family gatherings they\u2019d have to hear their deceased daughter\u2019s name be called out.

A lot of people do use the same name for their \"rainbow baby\" after miscarriage. I honestly thought that's what she was mad about.", "It does to the grieving family.
