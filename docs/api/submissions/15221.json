Both me and Layla are married, I to \"Pam\" (29F) and Layla to \"Greg\" (30M). Me and my sister had a grandma who sadly passed away when we were in high school. Since we are both married and both plan on having kids, the topic of names came up and we both said we wanted to name a child after our grandma, lets say her name was Victoria. We didn't really fight about this per se and just agreed whoever had a daughter first could use the name. About a year ago Pam got pregnant which was very exciting. We found out it was a girl and did a gender reveal where we announced we were going to use the name Victoria. My sister was not upset about this and jokingly said something along the lines of you beat me to the punch. A few weeks after this my sister announced that she was pregnant.\n\nSadly, late into the pregnancy Pam miscarried and lost the baby. This was incredibly difficult on us and Pam suffered especially bad, both physically and mentally. My family has been there to support us but we have asked Layla to give us some space as seeing her pregnant is a lot for us at this time. While she was upset about this, she understood. Recently, my parents threw my sister a gender reveal party similar to the one we had for Pam. My Mom convinced me and Pam to go and we felt we were in a good spot to go. We get to the party and all is great until we get to the gender/name reveal. The way it was going to work was Greg's family was inside the garage holding a banner that would be pink or blue and say the babys name. When the garage opened me and my wife were shocked to see a banner that said \"Welcome baby Victoria Greg's last name\". I asked my sister WTF and she said since we weren't using the name its only fair she should get to. My wife started sobbing and I took her to my car but not before telling my sister she is an evil human being who doesn't deserve to be a mother. Now my Mom is mad at me because Layla also has a high-risk pregnancy and this was very stressful for her. Most of my family is saying I should apologize for what I said. AITA?\n\nETA: I think people may be confused about this and this is my fault for using the wrong words. When i say miscarried, my wife gave birth to a stillborn. while our daughter was never alive, my wife gave birth to her, it was just too early for the baby to live sadly. Our daughter is buried in a grave that says Victoria, which I think is part of the reason I was so upset", "created_utc": 1681953521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sh43e/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_gender_reveal/", "score": 2460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should not have been at that party, and instead your sister should have discussed the naming again, with you and your wife in case it was a girl.

Your daughter is named Victoria and your sister has zero right to use it and claim you aren't. I'm so sorry for your loss and the way this gender/name reveal played out..

However, she should have the emotional capacity to recognize how traumatic it is for you and your wife. It\u2019s bad enough to insist on using the \u201cunused name\u201d (wtf??) but to also blindside you, at an already triggering event\u2026 that\u2019s pretty bad.

Not until/unless they experience it themselves. Even then, some brush off the heartbreak. This little fact explains \u2014 but not excuses \u2014 the utter cluelessness of these people. \n\nBefore my mom was conceived a little girl named June was born to my grandparents. She died an hour or two after she was born. They called her a \u201cblue baby\u201d which could have been any number of heart or lung problems back then.

I'm *vicariously* outraged, *not* evil, and this post struck such a nerve within me.\n\nSaying such a thing *should* be taken by Layla as a *wake up call* to how *unspeakably* awful *her* decision was: **pure, unthinking cruelty, and the worst kind of unreflected self-absorption.**\n\nNTA\n\nOP, if there is a positive aftermath, please provide an update.

I'm so so sorry. And I can absolutely relate because I was in a similar situation. My child died shortly after birth due to a late term pregnancy complication. I was pregnant at the same time as my SiL. We both wanted to use the same name. We used it, our child died. \n\nLuckily for us they had a child of a different gender and we were saved from this ever being an issue. But seeing her pregnant after our baby had died was incredibly difficult. Watching their child reach milestones was also very difficult, until they got a little older and became a little person to us in their own right, rather than just a reminder of our child who was never going to reach those milestones. I don't think we would have been able to reach this point if their child had the same name. I think they would forever have been a walking trigger for us, which wouldn't be fair to us or the child. \n\nIf they were so set on doing this (which they should not have been), I wish they had asked or even just told you privately first. Given you a chance to explain how difficult this would be for you. Or at least allowed you to have your own private reaction to it. They could have privately asked you if they could use the name to honour both your grandma and your daughter's memory. But they seem to have not even considered your feelings at all. And so soon after your daughter's death whilst you are in such a difficult place. They have been utterly inconsiderate to grieving parents, and so so selfish. \n\nSending love and strength to you, your wife \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA but this only one of us can use the name rule has got to be stopped. There's no reason the siblings couldn't say hey if we have daughters why don't we both use Victoria as a middle name while giving our children unique first names.

You don't need to go through something to be empathetic.", "I don't think it matters if the sister has experienced losing a child. I haven't lost a child and I can recognize this is messed up beyond belief. She lacks any kind of empathy whatsoever.", "All of this. People who care about you will try to understand why this is hard instead of brushing off your pain. The fact that your mom pressured you to go to a gender reveal (for the child that would take your daughter\u2019s place as the first acknowledged granddaughter, no less) shows a complete lack of empathy. After you lose a child, at any stage, you learn to filter people out who don\u2019t care or you go through life constantly miserable.", "I also think stillbirth is a whole different thing to a miscarriage (which I have had). It isn't just 'we just found out we are pregnant and want to use this name' but more 'our daughter was actually born'.

OP said losing their child was extremely hard on him and his wife, which was well known by their family. It\u2019s also just common sense. This was more than just shock and anger - it was grief and torturous pain being shoved in their faces, as a celebration for someone else, and a reminder that being around their own niece is going to be literal hell for the rest of their lives. OP\u2019s reaction in the moment makes perfect sense, and I don\u2019t blame him one bit for lashing out at his sister.

You miscarried.\n\nSeems logical, but nowadays, miscarriage term usually used when the pregnancy ends early in the process.
