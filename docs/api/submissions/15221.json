Both me and Layla are married, I to \"Pam\" (29F) and Layla to \"Greg\" (30M). Me and my sister had a grandma who sadly passed away when we were in high school. Since we are both married and both plan on having kids, the topic of names came up and we both said we wanted to name a child after our grandma, lets say her name was Victoria. We didn't really fight about this per se and just agreed whoever had a daughter first could use the name. About a year ago Pam got pregnant which was very exciting. We found out it was a girl and did a gender reveal where we announced we were going to use the name Victoria. My sister was not upset about this and jokingly said something along the lines of you beat me to the punch. A few weeks after this my sister announced that she was pregnant.\n\nSadly, late into the pregnancy Pam miscarried and lost the baby. This was incredibly difficult on us and Pam suffered especially bad, both physically and mentally. My family has been there to support us but we have asked Layla to give us some space as seeing her pregnant is a lot for us at this time. While she was upset about this, she understood. Recently, my parents threw my sister a gender reveal party similar to the one we had for Pam. My Mom convinced me and Pam to go and we felt we were in a good spot to go. We get to the party and all is great until we get to the gender/name reveal. The way it was going to work was Greg's family was inside the garage holding a banner that would be pink or blue and say the babys name. When the garage opened me and my wife were shocked to see a banner that said \"Welcome baby Victoria Greg's last name\". I asked my sister WTF and she said since we weren't using the name its only fair she should get to. My wife started sobbing and I took her to my car but not before telling my sister she is an evil human being who doesn't deserve to be a mother. Now my Mom is mad at me because Layla also has a high-risk pregnancy and this was very stressful for her. Most of my family is saying I should apologize for what I said. AITA?\n\nETA: I think people may be confused about this and this is my fault for using the wrong words. When i say miscarried, my wife gave birth to a stillborn. while our daughter was never alive, my wife gave birth to her, it was just too early for the baby to live sadly. Our daughter is buried in a grave that says Victoria, which I think is part of the reason I was so upset", "created_utc": 1681953521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sh43e/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_gender_reveal/", "score": 5127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is named Victoria and your sister has zero right to use it and claim you aren't. I'm so sorry for your loss and the way this gender/name reveal played out..

However, she should have the emotional capacity to recognize how traumatic it is for you and your wife. It\u2019s bad enough to insist on using the \u201cunused name\u201d (wtf??) but to also blindside you, at an already triggering event\u2026 that\u2019s pretty bad.

Watching their child reach milestones was also very difficult, until they got a little older and became a little person to us in their own right, rather than just a reminder of our child who was never going to reach those milestones. I don't think we would have been able to reach this point if their child had the same name. I think they would forever have been a walking trigger for us, which wouldn't be fair to us or the child. \n\nIf they were so set on doing this (which they should not have been), I wish they had asked or even just told you privately first. Given you a chance to explain how difficult this would be for you. Or at least allowed you to have your own private reaction to it. They could have privately asked you if they could use the name to honour both your grandma and your daughter's memory. But they seem to have not even considered your feelings at all.

Still, my brother named his daughter after his mom anyway and now both girls, cousins, carry her legacy. \nThe cool thing is that I also have my mom\u2019s name, so my baby cousin, my niece and I call each other \u201cname sisters\u201d as a little joke they made up to unite all of us. \nAlthough baby Victoria won\u2019t be able to joke about it with her \u201cname sister\u201d, I hope OP and his actual sister can forgive each other and just love each other as family again.", "I honestly don't understand why everyone seems to think that makes big difference.

It still would hurt if it was a name they *intended* to use but didn\u2019t get the chance, but that isn\u2019t the case here. OP\u2019s daughter already has the name.

The problem is you insinuating that it was being done with the intent of being hurtful to AH and Pam. \n\n>I never said it was intended to be malicious, but at BEST *they assumed* VERY recently bereaved parents would be fine with it, or *that they would be shamed into silence if told about the name in a public space.* \n\nAgain, you *say* that you're not insinuating malicious intent, but then you immediately decide that they were planning on using the public place to shame the others into silence. That's literally suggesting malicious intent. You're not helping your case. \n\n>You don't get to tell grieving parents,...\n\nSTOP. Just. Stop. No ONE gets to tell ANY parents what they can or cannot name their child. Period. The child's parents don't need *anyone's* permission, nor are they required to communicate their choices to anyone for approval. And no,... They don't even need the permission of grieving siblings. The child's name wasn't \"poorly chosen\" as you said. It was chosen out of love and respect. Don't try to make it a dirty thing. \n\nThe offense here was *taken*, not given. Asshole and Pam chose to take it personally, so their reaction, the fallout and the consequence IS ALL ON THEM. \n\nAnd no,... I don't blame AH and Pam for being upset. Emotions aren't always controllable or foreseeable or even understandable. Rightly or wrongly, sometimes they just happen.\n\nI DO blame them for how they handled their response.

I was pointing out to the other poster who actually sent out the invitation to the grieving couple, noting there was no ulterior or malicious motive involved. \n\n>ANYONE would have that reaction, grieving or not.\n\nAbsolutely. But people who get past taking grief personally eventually realize that others don't always make decisions in their own lives to hurt other people. If you've been hurt and take it personally, you can't always be responsible for feeling hurt, but you ARE responsible for taking it personally. That's what the counseling is for. To get you past reading motive where none may be intended and helping deal with the pain of loss. \n\nAnd OP was not a \"gentleman\" with his words.
