Both me and Layla are married, I to \"Pam\" (29F) and Layla to \"Greg\" (30M). Me and my sister had a grandma who sadly passed away when we were in high school. Since we are both married and both plan on having kids, the topic of names came up and we both said we wanted to name a child after our grandma, lets say her name was Victoria. We didn't really fight about this per se and just agreed whoever had a daughter first could use the name. About a year ago Pam got pregnant which was very exciting. We found out it was a girl and did a gender reveal where we announced we were going to use the name Victoria. My sister was not upset about this and jokingly said something along the lines of you beat me to the punch. A few weeks after this my sister announced that she was pregnant.\n\nSadly, late into the pregnancy Pam miscarried and lost the baby. This was incredibly difficult on us and Pam suffered especially bad, both physically and mentally. My family has been there to support us but we have asked Layla to give us some space as seeing her pregnant is a lot for us at this time. While she was upset about this, she understood. Recently, my parents threw my sister a gender reveal party similar to the one we had for Pam. My Mom convinced me and Pam to go and we felt we were in a good spot to go. We get to the party and all is great until we get to the gender/name reveal. The way it was going to work was Greg's family was inside the garage holding a banner that would be pink or blue and say the babys name. When the garage opened me and my wife were shocked to see a banner that said \"Welcome baby Victoria Greg's last name\". I asked my sister WTF and she said since we weren't using the name its only fair she should get to. My wife started sobbing and I took her to my car but not before telling my sister she is an evil human being who doesn't deserve to be a mother. Now my Mom is mad at me because Layla also has a high-risk pregnancy and this was very stressful for her. Most of my family is saying I should apologize for what I said. AITA?\n\nETA: I think people may be confused about this and this is my fault for using the wrong words. When i say miscarried, my wife gave birth to a stillborn. while our daughter was never alive, my wife gave birth to her, it was just too early for the baby to live sadly. Our daughter is buried in a grave that says Victoria, which I think is part of the reason I was so upset", "created_utc": 1681953521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12sh43e/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_gender_reveal/", "score": 10593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, she should have the emotional capacity to recognize how traumatic it is for you and your wife. It\u2019s bad enough to insist on using the \u201cunused name\u201d (wtf??) but to also blindside you, at an already triggering event\u2026 that\u2019s pretty bad.

Watching their child reach milestones was also very difficult, until they got a little older and became a little person to us in their own right, rather than just a reminder of our child who was never going to reach those milestones. I don't think we would have been able to reach this point if their child had the same name. I think they would forever have been a walking trigger for us, which wouldn't be fair to us or the child. \n\nIf they were so set on doing this (which they should not have been), I wish they had asked or even just told you privately first. Given you a chance to explain how difficult this would be for you. Or at least allowed you to have your own private reaction to it. They could have privately asked you if they could use the name to honour both your grandma and your daughter's memory. But they seem to have not even considered your feelings at all.

Still, my brother named his daughter after his mom anyway and now both girls, cousins, carry her legacy. \nThe cool thing is that I also have my mom\u2019s name, so my baby cousin, my niece and I call each other \u201cname sisters\u201d as a little joke they made up to unite all of us. \nAlthough baby Victoria won\u2019t be able to joke about it with her \u201cname sister\u201d, I hope OP and his actual sister can forgive each other and just love each other as family again.", "I honestly don't understand why everyone seems to think that makes big difference.

She told them they \"weren't using\" the name of their dead child. As if a dead child doesn't count in her eyes. \n\nIt doesnt even MATTER if offence was meant, if one doesnt try to make up for hurting others. As I said at best it was self centred and lacking communication. It IS also possible she had less savoury motivations - sibling dynamics can be complicated. Maybe she resented him for getting to use the name first. I'm certainly not going to assume there's no chance she was acting out, or that the party wasnt a way for her tl avoid talking to her brother about the choice. People do things that are I'll thought out or cowardly all the time.  I'm not accusing her of murder but of being a bad communicator and wanting to get her way.\n\nCommon decency and having the merest scrap of empathy would suggest that this would warrant at least a discussion - as a heads-up if nothing else. We often do kind things we aren't obligated to do because we care for others. Most people on here seem to grasp that concept. \n\nFreedom to make a choice also doesn't absolve them of consequences.

Layla told OP that he's not using the name Victoria. Given that there is a grave that reads Victoria where his daughter was buried pretty much implies that Layla does not see his late daughter as being a valid person who will forever have been named Victoria. \n\nA comment like that would reasonably read to someone that Layla does not appreciate that love a parent could have for their child and how real they were. From that point, Layla sounds shallow and I could see how, in that moment of grief, Layla did not come off as someone deserving to be a mom if she wouldn't love her baby if they passed away. \n\nObviously, the reality is probably Layla is out of touch. And I dont think a grieving parent is the best source of objective judgment, but given how they were bombarded with this unexpectedly and reacted as most would, it makes sense as to why OP would say that. \n\nLayla can name her baby whatever she wants.

It is obvious based on context that she would not name the daughter Victoria had OPs daughter lived. OPs sister pretty much told them that their stillborn was not a valid person.

Many families have more than one \"Robert\" or \"Elizabeth\" or whatever, and different nicknames are used.\n\nI have a friend who really wanted to name her daughter, NAME A. She loved the name. She got pregnant, and sadly her daughter had a profound physical defect; they knew the baby would die within a couple of days of birth. So, in order to save NAME A for a baby that would actually get a real chance to live, she named the baby NAME B. Which she still loved, but wasn't her dream name. That way, when she had another daughter several years down the line, she named it NAME A. \n\nI wish you would have adjusted the name so you could have the joy of having a living \"Victoria\" down the line. It would have been so much more amazing if you were able to actually USE the name Victoria for another child of yours. Even if it doubled with her cousin.", "NTA and I am so deeply sorry for your loss. I lost a pregnancy at almost 17 weeks. Not quite a stillbirth, but I was in the second trimester. There is no pain like losing a wanted pregnancy. It ripped my heart out. And even though I got pregnant again shortly afterward with my rainbow baby (who is now almost 8 years old), I still carry a hole in my heart where my first baby was. Your sister is beyond insensitive and should absolutely be ashamed of herself. I also feel sorry for her unborn daughter, who now has this horrible thing attached to her name. Whatever happens with the name, I do hope that you and your wife are able to work through your grief. I very gently suggest seeing a therapist who deals with grief and loss, and possibly joining a support group for other parents who have lost pregnancies. Again, my deepest condolences to you and your wife, and I am sending you both love.", "NTA,  Really sorry for your loss,  however the Baby is Victoria, your sister is wrong all the way.  She should have chosen a different name for her baby,  Maybe Grandma's middle name would solve the issue.  Hold strong.", "While I think they should have talked to you about using the name before the reveal, there is nothing wrong with her using the name. It's a very personal thing, but I would be happy to see the name being passed on to the next generation. It honors the cousin and the grandmother. I don't think you are at fault for being upset as it was shocking for you, and they should have known that if they were aware that you named your child Victoria. That was inconsiderate of them. Hope the family can figure it all out and move on in love and honor.", "NAH", "ESH \n\nYou suck because of your outburst. \n\nYour sister sucks for the way she revealed the gender. HOWEVER she isn't the AH for naming her child. \n\n\nYes it's extremely sad and unfortunate that you two lost your baby, but you can't gate keep a name.", "Firstly my deepest sympathies to you and your wife for the loss of your child.\n\nI do think though that unless you expressly said to your sister that she shouldn't use the name, then I feel she would have felt it was fine. You cant expect someone to understand your experience and how you feel, if you don't explain it t them, let alone call them evil.\n\nYour sister didn't do this to hurt you, but from lack of knowledge and you need to understand that knowledge should have come from you and as you had asked to keep your distance, it was up to you to let her know.\n\nFinally the information that your sister has a high-risk pregnancy , makes YTA here. You have and are going through this, why would you think it fair or right to subject your sister to it too.", "she\u2019s insane", ">Your sister should not have invited you to the gender reveal if she knew that there was a 50% chance the banner would read Victoria. \n\nTheir parents planned the party and pressured OP to go, not his sister so I don't see how he can blame her for that. Sounds like she just brought a few tailored things to the party.", "If I had pulled some shit like this on my brother and his wife, my whole family would be raining hell down on my head. As they should. My mom would be yelling at me, not my brother.", "I\u2019ve never lost a child and my jaw hit the floor when I read what OP\u2019s sister did. I would have asked her what the fuck is wrong with her and walked out with them. That\u2019s just mind-boggling selfishness.", "I totally believe OP\u2019s sister was extremely insensitive and out of touch. Possibly even cruel. I am just pointing out that there are many families with cousins of the same generation (and different generations) with the same name. That it\u2019s not uncommon. OP (and wife) saying she doesn\u2019t deserve to be a mother on top of already refusing to see his pregnant sister when it was also high risk, while in the beginning is somewhat understandable, how long does that go? Will they be able to tolerate niece (regardless of name cause it sounds like they never would have due to how close in age the kids would have been)? At what point are you punishing the child for their name (and living) that they had no control over? OP and wife should explore therapy. Again, I am so sorry for their loss.", "exactly. im very confused as to why i'm even seeing some people say \"i read miscarriage but then found out it was a still born which THEN solidified my NTA\". like *what*? miscarriage and having a still born are BOTH child loss and no one here is to say that a mother does or doesn't feel the same pain in either happening. all parents know is they don't get to come home with their little one and they grieve for them the rest of their life.", "Your suggestion is even better!", "OP u/Patient-Ad8524, I would say these exact same words to both your mother and sister, or at the very least screen shot this and send it to them. The extended cruelty of this will likely effect your extended family dynamic for a very long time.", "You did the right thing by asking if it was okay with her first. A middle name is much more appropriate then a first name for sure.", "Miscarriages can happen up to 20 weeks gestation. I was almost 17 weeks when I miscarried. I don't think we should be comparing which pregnancy loss is worse, as they are all devastating to the pregnant person (if the pregnancy is wanted, of course)."]}
