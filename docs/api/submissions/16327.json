If he makes you that uncomfortable, don't be with him unless it is in public.  That would be manageable at a wedding. Attend but don't be near the groom unless in a group.

I would absolutely never stay at the home again or ever do any joint engagements where you have to stay together.  I would attend the wedding though, and simply avoid the groom.  There are plenty of people in attendance and you could also just attend the ceremony and not the reception or only stay a short while.

It was weird, but also maybe mom\u2019s boyfriend was justified in being protective - maybe he knows mom likes to leave the door open during her baths or something?  It didn\u2019t have to be a big, drawn out ordeal.  Just don\u2019t go upstairs while she\u2019s in the bath.  Boom.  Done.\n\nAnother option - you and/or your fianc\u00e9 could talk to the boyfriend **yourselves** about the incident.  Since it involved you guys, and not your mom.  \u201cWe are introverts and don\u2019t like drama\u201d is no excuse to force your mom to get involved in this.  If it bothers you so much that you are considering missing their wedding over it, then it needs to be addressed.\n\nYou are refusing to go to their house or even attend their wedding because you say \u201cthey won\u2019t acknowledge the incident\u201d - but you are also refusing to acknowledge it and talk about it *yourselves*.  \n\nIf you\u2019re honestly willing to cut ties with your own mother over this, fine.
