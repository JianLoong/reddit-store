I was driving them to our Mother's Day plans when we started talking about what I would be wearing to an upcoming event. I told her I bought a new dress because none of my dresses that I would normally wear fit me, as I recently gained a little weight.\n\nAfter our Mother's Day lunch, I was driving her and her partner back to her house when she asked me, \"How much weight have  you gained?\" I very politely and calmly responded, \"That's none of your business.\" She became very upset so I clarified, \"It's nobody's business.\"\n\nShe said I was acting like a child. Specifically, my 12 year-old niece who is prone to temper tantrums and tells her mom she is embarrassing and sometimes gets super moody, as a lot of tweens can be. My mom told me I was acting like that. I explained that I don't have to tell anyone how much weight I've gained, and that it was not a nice question for her to ask. She kept arguing with me and I said I personally would never ask anyone else that. \n\nMom then made this hand gesture as if to wave me off, shush me or dismiss me, scrunched up her face, and in a sarcastic tone said, \"It's ok, it's ok.\" I said \"you don't seem ok\" and she was completely silent for the rest of the ride home. She is not a quiet person- she only does that when she is upset or she has been called out and does not want to apologize.\n\nFor context, I have not gained an extreme amount of weight, it's just enough that some of my clothes are tight on me. I am still well within the normal range for my age and height, I go to the gym and watch what I eat, so it's not like my health is in danger.\n\nFor more context, Mom has a long history of negative comments about other people's looks/appearances, including mine. She is very critical of others' weight, hair, skin, clothes, etc. all the time.\n\nShe says I owe her an apology and I was disrespectful.

When parents are this critical they always wonder why they don't see their kids", "NTA. Your second to last paragraph sums it up. Your mum is judgemental and critical of appearances. Don\u2019t reward this behaviour by sharing information that is 1) none of her business, and 2) very insensitive to ask about.", "Nope. NTA.\n\nNone of their business. If they had approached the issue tactfully, maybe you'd have told them, but they didn't.", "NTA. Obviously, she was fishing information for gossip or other malicious purposes. To use against you in some future argument...", "NTA obviously", "NTA, and further, I applaud you for not giving in to her poor behavior.", "You aren't a child, and she isn't entitled to any information you don't want to share. \n\nNTA", "NTA, \n\nYour mom seems unhealthily interested in your weight gain. And you don't need to justify it BTW, it's nobodies buisness including hers.", "NTA, your mom's being insensitive and judgemental. It's always impolite to talk about someone's weight and appearance", "NTA", "NTA. She was rude. You shouldn\u2019t tolerate rude questions.  You set a healthy boundary. Good for you.", "NTA, good for you for standing up for yourself and sticking to it. Of course she's not happy that you're not bending to her will. She will get over it or not but that's on her.", "Oh, OP, the only asshole here is your mother, and she's all huffy because she knows it. NTA", "If you had told her exactly how much she would have mentioned that in random conversations for the next month or two at every opportunity. Congratulations on handling it so well!", "NTA, your mother was rude for asking and her actions were childish.", "NTA", "NTA. You are an adult that takes care of your own needs. You do not need to be pressured into answering that by your mother. She was the one being rude. YOU are the one that deserves the apology.", "NTA. Invasive moms are so toxic!", "NTA. The audacity to even ask that question is appalling.", "NTA. Personally, I would've gone for the \"not enough that you noticed\" line instead of none of your business lol. But no, that's your business and whoever *you* wish to share it with. She owes YOU an apology.", "NTA. Your mother is TA for insisting you tell her and then acting like a petulant child when you refused. It IS nobody's business except your own, unless you choose to share that information.\n\nYou owe no apology, quite the opposite in fact and were in no way disrespectful.", "NTA. Your weight is something that you can absolutely choose not to disclose, especially if your mom is known to criticize it. I have the same issue with mine and we were fighting so much about it, but ever since I started answering with \"I'm handling it\" things have gotten much better", "NTA. I won't even tell my bf how much I weigh. It's not something anyone else needs to know. You're right, it's nobody's business.", "NTA. Even if you gained 150 lbs, it's not information she's owed. She's acting like a petulant child because you enforced a boundary.", "NTA!\n\nShe insists on you telling her something that is not her business and gets grumpy when she doesn't get her way? Sounds like she's the childish one!", "My mum once commented on my weight and that I'd gained a lot, and I told her to never comment on my weight again unless she was going to pay for the dietician, therapist and doctor to ensure I wasn't falling back into an eating disorder. \n\nShe's never stopped so fast in her life, and I got a quick apology.", "NTA - I can forgive if the question originally slipped out, sometimes people don't think before they speak. But her response is not acceptable.\n\nI recently had a similar conversation with my Dad: I'm pregnant and mentioned I've only put on about 1.6kg so far (I'm on the heavy side anyway so I don't want to put on too much). He asked me what I weigh now, so I laughed and said \"it's none of your business!\". He laughed too and said \"Oh, right, of course!\"", "No NTA I don't understand why mums are like this? Just the other day my mum looked at me whilst I was sitting drinking tea and just said \"have your boobs got bigger?\" I was really uncomfortable and it wasn't necessary.\nIt's not her business and she shouldn't comment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
