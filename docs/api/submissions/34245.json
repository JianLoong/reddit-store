No matter how you act or what you do, she will always have something to be upset about. And at this point, haven\u2019t you spent too much time in your life catering to your mother\u2019s temper tantrums?\n\nI know it\u2019s not easy but go NC/LC and if anyone in your family questions it, you can just point out that \u201chey, you didn\u2019t want me to upset mom, so I took that to heart.\u201d", "NTA, and I would suggest doing some research on the term \u2018glass child\u2019.

Definitely limit contact with your mother because being put in a no-win situation is all on her. Have you suggested therapy for your mom? She could still be grieving even after 5yrs.", "NTA\n\nI've known people like your mother all my life. She doesn't want the lie or the truth, what she wants is for you to LIE CONVINCINGLY. \n\nYou probably guessed, what she wants is for YOU to convince HER, that she was a great mom and not that she didn't bother to protect you, but that she was a super mom that committed to Grade A parenting!\n\nNope out of these convos, they do nothing for either of you. \"I know where this is going. I don't know how to lie well enough to make it believable, and you don't want the truth, so tell me why you are doing this AGAIN?!?! I'm going to let you go now, you don't sound well at all, and this is taxing for both of us.\" *click!*", "NTA Never ever lie to her again. She had it rough, but so did you, so did your entire family. If she wants to pretend she was all alone in her suffering, its about time people made sure she knew that they were suffering too. I cant imagine being trapped in a house 24/7 with no break and no escape, trying to raise a child that was terrorizing my other children, I would go insane. You see tv shows about Mothers doing things to their kids then themselves. This is why that happens. Truthfully, you may be lucky mom is still alive at all. Its all too much, but pretending it wasnt also horrible for others in the home is hurtful and dismissive of their suffering. I have pity for your mother and sympathy for you.  Maybe some family therapy would help all of you.", "NTA - Having very serious grievances about traumatic experiences as a child does not make you \"Ungrateful\".", "NTA - that your parents were doing the best they could (maybe) and that it still sucked horribly for you are not incompatible truths. Your mom shouldn't ask if she can't handle the answers. Kudos to you for being brave enough to speak your truth and I hope you find some healing in telling her your perspective.", "NTA. You mother is just emotionally manipulative, and maybe a little abusive. When someone puts you in a no-win scenario like that, where any decision will have a negative outcome, that is 100% on them. Your mother pushed you to say what was on your mind, so it's on her to accept that.", "NTA. I imagine your parents really did hope to give you kids a nice vacation, but your mother shouldn't have fished for a response if she didn't want to know the truth. It's too late to do anything about it now, but maybe you two and the rest of the family can have a more honest relationship going forward.", "NTA. Your mom doesn't get to rewrite history just because she doesn't like to be reminded that she failed you and your sister as a parent. If telling her the truth helps you deal with it, you continue doing so.", "Is this a repost? I swear I\u2019ve read this before", "NTA at all. Jesus christ. Hope you are feeling better now. All the best wishes to you, holy shit.", "Maybe limit conversations with her.", "NTA- as someone with multiple kids (all fine mentally and physically thankfully) it can be hard balancing the needs/wants of everyone, but it doesn't seem like your parents even tried very hard. Your mom sounds exhausting and out of touch", "You mother is just a sad women who\u2019s life was hard and she secretly resents it as much as you do but doesn\u2019t have the courage to admit it, even to herself and she feels guilty for feeling the way she does.  She needs counseling for this but probably won\u2019t.  Ask her if she would rather you tell her the ugly truth or tell a lie to make her feel better about the truth she doesn\u2019t see.  Often times people that share an experience have different memories of that experience.", "NTA. I have a parent with mental health problems and I can totally commiserate with the whole \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" element of this story. I had no idea how to deal with her when I was younger, but now I've learned to dole out hard truths in bite-sized morsels rather than whole plate fulls. \n\nI had to catch myself just the other day talking about something that both she and my sister used to do that was just soooo wrong. I implied that is was more than one person but when explaining it, used my sister as the example. My mom isn't stupid so she knows I was also talking about her as well, but because I didn't hit her over the head with a blatant accusation she was able to hear what I was saying without becoming defensive and feeling as if she personally was being attacked. Because I didn't trigger her fight or flight response, she was able to remain rational and \u2026 she actually apologized! \n\nAnyway, big digital hug being sent your way. The best advice I can give you is to learn about your family dynamics from a psychological point of view (which it seems as if you've already done) but to also learn more about how neurotransmitters in our brains reward or punish behavior which can help you understand the root of most bad behavior. And understand that, any sort of embarassment or shame can trigger fight or flight response, but for some, the prefrontal cortex that is supposed to add a layer of rational perception to the situation just doesn't kick in and their response is all emotion and no logic. Avoiding triggering them makes life soooooo much easier.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who are at their wits\u2019 end but don\u2019t want to send their child to a facility should read your post. They are choosing to ostracize and terrorize their other kids and the damage will be long term.", "Nta\n\nShe demanded an answer for a question that she knows she didn't want the answer for, she shouldn't have asked.", "NTA \n\n>I was called ungrateful and spoilt because \"most kids never got a vacation home\" I said I never asked for one and would've gladly traded it in for a safer and more normal childhood.\n\nYour parents made their choices and telling you that you should be grateful for those choices is the worst type of parenting. I'm sorry you had to go through that then and now.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t ask questions she doesn\u2019t want an honest answer to. Sure things were challenging for your parents, but they\u2019re the ones who signed up for parenthood and any and all challenges that life choice brings. That includes the possibility of a disabled child. They got to navigate it all as adults. Children have no say. It sounds like she would benefit from therapy.", "NTA.", "You are totally NTA. May I ask what CPTSD is?", "NTA\n\nHave you tried, \"Mom, you don't want to know my opinion, change the subject.\"?", "NTA. My mother also thinks that \"doing the best they could\" should forgive every bit of emotional trauma they caused by their lack of attention to my needs (my severe ADHD and ASD went undiagnosed until I was an adult because they didn't want their parents to judge them for having a ND child). You shouldn't have to coddle your parents at the expense of your own mental health, especially if they were part of the problem.", "NTA...Your mother is obviously feeling guilty though, and got upset because she was hoping you would alleviate her guilt. I grew up with an autistics brother and although my family was way too poor and dysfunctional for vacations when I was younger (went on my first one with my husband at 22 LOL)...daily life sucked, so I can only imagine how that would bleed over into vacation...", "NTA\n\nDoing your best doesn't mean you did great or that here was no collateral damage. \n\nTalking to your mother about it looks like a no win situation - no matter what you say, she'll be upset and angry at something or someone.", "NTA. She wanted you to reassure her that everything was always fine and perfect when it clearly wasn't. She's fully aware that she made mistakes and hoped you would somehow absolve her. Your refusal to play along ruined her plan. \n\nMy mother is like this too. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA \nIf you're damned if you do AND damned if you don't, you may as well just tell her the truth  - her feelings be damned. \n\nAlso, no. Just because you had a vacation home doesn't mean you should be grateful. It was her job, and your father's, to provide a safe home life for you all. By the sounds of it, they failed at that. I'm sure it was terribly hard for them but that doesn't negate the impact it had on *you* and you have every right to speak your piece on that.", "NTA, but I have compassion for your mother, too. I\u2019m raising a child with disabilities (not autism) and I know it has affected my other children, but we are doing the best we can. It\u2019s very difficult for everyone. We got our other kids in a therapy program when they were little. I think a lot of people don\u2019t consider the affect disability has on the other children in the family.", "You all are all adults, right? I agree with you not to feed into this nonsense at all. But it seems you just can't win. \n\nNTA. Be truthful, maybe she will finally get it", "NTA. You are not obligated to hide your trauma because it might make your mom upset. While I'm sure she did do the best that she could, the circumstances you described sound absolutely awful and you are not obligated to pretend that it was fine for you to save her feelings. She had three children and two of them were left without their needs and safety prioritized because of the heightened needs of the third. That's simply a fact and one that she should be acknowledging and trying to work through in therapy. Patting her on the head so that she doesn't have to acknowledge the truth of the matter is not good for anyone - and is particularly bad for you, as someone who is having to unravel all of that trauma now. The fact that she called you spoiled and ungrateful is horrifying, honestly. Sounds like your family desperately needs to deal with some pretty hard truths that have been getting swept under the rug.", "NTA - Your mother seems more concerned with portraying herself as this struggling, suffering mother who just did everything to give her kids a \u201cnormal, privileged childhood\u201d. However, who did the vacation home really help? Not you and your living sister. Not your deceased sister. If anything, many of her meltdowns may have been caused *by* her routine being upended to go to the Jersey Shore for reasons that she had no understanding of.", "INFO - what is NT sidtet? What is CPTSD?  Alll these labels people call themselves and each other are getting really really hard to follow.\n\nBut from what I understood...NTA for you. Sounds like your mom was pressing you and if she asks, she should be able to handle the truth and you should be able to speak it.", "NTA. We did not vacation often when I was little. So to make up for it, my mother once decided on two consecutive years to do a road trip. I named them the \"road trip from hell part 1 and 2.\" She knows I call them this. I didn't have to deal with safety issues on our trips, but they were full of more stress than fun. \n\nMy mother and I do not take trips together nor do we spend more than 3 days together in a confined space unless we negotiate it ahead of time (she came to visit me during my semester abroad, and this added that caveat). \n\nThings have been better. But I know my experience on these trips was not her experience on these trips. She has finally recognized that over 25 years later.", "Nta", "NTA. Vacations with family can be tough, especially when dealing with a high needs sibling. You have every right to express your true feelings and experiences without being labeled as ungrateful or spoiled. Your parents should understand and support you, instead of brushing off your struggles. Keep standing up for yourself and don't let their emotions dictate how you feel about your own life.", "NAH - It is obvious that both of you (your mother and you) have had a rough time, each from their own perspective and role. You mother tried her hardest, but unfortunately wasnt enough (and you have the right to feel that way as you were a child suffering from the consecuences of a very complicated situation).\n\nNAH, just two people having to dealt with a complicated hand in life. Hope the best for you and your mother, and I wish you the empathy to keep talking and understanding each other.", "NTA\n\nI always say the truth is always the best policy", "NTA\n\nYour mother probably needs some therapy.\n\nTake care of you OP.  And no need to lie, especially since she asked.", "NTA at all. Your mom sounds very immature.  I had a shitty childhood because of my mom's choices but she has apologized and doesn't demand me to lie that it was fine - so I don't rub it in her face. But if she tried what your mom did I'd absolutely tell her the blunt truth.", "NTA, your mom know everything, she just wanted to stir the bottom of the lake for some drama to play her victm complex again...  \nAlmost narcisistic.", "NAH. To put it bluntly, there was no way for your parents to come out on top in that situation.\n\nAnyone who thinks OP's parents are TAs here clearly has no experience raising a special needs kid.", "I mean, why? Why put yourself through this? \n\nSo what you are saying happened: Your mom KNEW it sucked, but was trying to manipulate you into saying \"No mom, it was great\" or \"You did everything you could to make us all happy\" so she could feel validated. \n\nIf that is all true, then:\n- Here is where your siblings are wrong: You didn't have to lie to validate her. You didn't have to play the game.\n\n- Here is where you are wrong: You played her game anyway. You gave her a reason to feel validated b/c you went off on her with your \"honesty\" and now he can call any valid complait you have as \"just being the spoiled, ungrateful child\", tell her sob story to your siblings or anyone else and get the validation she was looking for from you. You fell into a ridiculously obvious trap. \n\nYou are 36 now. You know how she is, no? Why are you still playing her game?\n\nYeah, it sucked having all that going on, but at the same time, what did you expect your parents to do? Leave your siblings behind? Not be stressed 24/7? No, they didn't handle any of it well, but not a lot of people could hold up well under that kind of stress and be amazing parents and good partners. \n\nYou have a hair trigger w/ your mom and you don't have nearly the stress she was going through during your childhood. How old was she and her father when this was going on compared to how old you are now? \n\nI'm not saying you have to forgive either of you parents. I'm not saying you have to sweep that your childhood was difficult under the rug. I'm not saying you have to give into your mom's martyrdom BS. \n\nWhat I am saying is: There is no point in hanging on to this anger the way you are. There is no point in trying to beat your mom over the head that the family stress and how badly it was handled made your childhood suck. I'm sure she plays martyr b/c she knows and she just wants some reassurance.\n\nYou have a lot more freedom, options and opportunities that your parents didn't have re: mental health resources then they had at the same age. Yeah, some of their situation was of their own choice, but sometimes you make stupid or uninformed choices and have to live w/ the consequences. Families that have severely disable children often just don't have the capacity (sometimes monitary, but usually just mentally - no one trains you how to deal with that kind of stress and demand) to handle a severly disabled child and balance a relationship and also be the kind of parent you need to be to your other children.\n\nAgain, you don't have to give her reassurance that it didn't mess you up. You just have to not engage. Or, if you engage, you could actually ask questions to understand her better - I don't know you or your mon, so I don't know if this the type of dialog that is even possible, but what you describe sounds more like a woman who wants to be understood, not a woman who wants to be made a saint.\n\nOption 1:\nMom: Those beach vacations weren't ideal.\nYou: Huh... Have you been to the beach lately? Are you planning any trips?\n\nOption 2:\nMom: Those beach vacations weren't ideal.\nYou: You always seemed stressed, what made the vacations so difficult? [and then just listen w/ open ears - ask questions and when she says something you disagree with, ask her why she had that impression instead of trying to guilt trip her.]\n\nSo yeah, YTA. You are 36 yrs old. You need to understand: A. How not to fall into your mom's trap - if it actually is a trap, or to engage her in non-judgemental conversation if it isn't a trap B. Your childhood sucked for your parents too and they screwed up, but it wasn't b/c they didn't love you or were uncaring monsters, it was because they didn't have the emotional/mental capacity to deal with it all. Is that a failing on them, sure, but a huge % of the population would have failed the test your parents were given.\n\nEdit: Updated formatting", "NTA and don\u2019t expect her to change. I\u2019d just try to avoid conversations like that in the future.", "NTA", "NTA, you\u2019ve clearly struggled with a difficult situation growing up. Gently, I\u2019d suggest your mum has an insane amount of guilt about the whole thing and is extremely defensive about it. I hat could she do? She had to try and provide for you and NT sister, give you experiences, while taking care of a very high needs child. It\u2019ll have absolutely drained the life out of her at times, and I guarantee you she\u2019ll have broken her heart about it a million times. She will know the truth, but she\u2019ll struggle with. And that\u2019s ok, and you\u2019re entitled to your feelings as well. You didn\u2019t get to have the typical upbringing your friends did, you will have been weary of dealing with your sister and the time she took up with your parents. All round heartbreaking. Your mum sounds like she needs a little help dealing with the whole thing. Maybe help her talk to you about things, let you air things, offload, and try and let you know a little of how she felt. I have a great deal of sympathy for you all in this situation.", "Who does this help now? You should have just ended the call.", "In this instance YTA because she wasn't even talking to you, she was talking to her mom, and you inserted your opinion into her conversation.

One of the adults needs to keep an eye on Jimmy at all times and follow him round (not socialising with the other 2) or alternatively just stay in the caravan with him while the other 2 go out which can breed resentment. A holiday should be relaxing for my partner and I too.\n\nThis year we went to Dorset with just Jimmy and left holly at her nans. We could both maintain focus on Jimmy/ take it turns to look after him. Focus on what he would enjoy. We took him to Peppa Pig World and he was able to have a meltdown and we could just leave without his sister asking why we were leaving when she wanted to stay. We had evenings in where me and my partner played cards and board games and he enjoyed himself watching his tablet without his sister moaning that she wanted to be with the other kids. Most importantly he had focus and my partner and I had quality time together. \n\nLater this year I intend to take holly and my partner on a similar holiday except we will be able to go to the evening entertainment together and allow holly to run off and play with the other kids and while not totally unsupervised or watched; have a little more trust that she will be ok and be able to be a little more relaxed together at a table than worrying if Jimmy had managed to escape the building.\n\nIt can be difficult as it means double the holidays to a degree and am not ruling out a joint one again in the future but it just seems fairer to everyone. \n\nI do sympathise with parents trying to do something for everyone.

Let him be pissy for a reason.", "Mum wanted OP to lie and praise her. She doesn't care about the truth, she wants to be told she was a marvel and did an amazing job and everything was peachy. Nothing else will satisfy her. The only way is to not engage. \"We're not talking about this\" and then ignore her pestering or leave. Vent to someone who actually cares about your experience, mum is the wrong audience and will only do more harm.", "Yeah, we all long for affirmation, but strong-arming your adult children into lying about how great their childhoods were is definitely a bridge too far.", "Keeping your mouth closed when your parent spins their version of your past is also exhausting. In my experience, refusing to bend your lived experience to their rewrite is difficult but eventually the delusional parent will move on...they will go low contact on their own, they will stop bringing up the topic, or they will find another victim. These people want validation and if you don't give it to them, they will look for another supply.", "The thing is, OP has got in trouble with her mother for lying before so thought the truth was the best approach in this situation, especially as she was actually validating her mothers feelings that it could be difficult rather than arguing with her. It really sounds like an emotional minefield where there is no right response.", "The truth can change a lot for OP.  I grew up with a VERY high needs sister.  My entire life revolved around her.  I absolutely know my mom did her best, I don\u2019t resent my mom or my sister.  I adored my sister and cared for her 24/7 the last fifteen years of her life.  But the fact is, there are scars.  I did suffer because of my sister\u2019s profound disabilities and needs.  Not talking about them creates shame and anger.  It eats away at you like hate.  My mom isn\u2019t manipulative and acknowledges that I was often shortchanged so we have open conversations about the ways I was shortchanged as a kid (and frankly as an adult).  She is apologetic.  She actually feels terrible for the way my early childhood turned out (we have opposite memories-she feels she abandoned me to protect my sister in the hospital but I felt safe, loved, and treasured staying with my grandparents.  My mom isn\u2019t in most of my memories, but I never felt abandoned.  She couldn\u2019t be there but she found someone who couldn\u2019t have loved me more.).  She had no fault in my sister\u2019s needs and she struggled hard because of my deadbeat drunkard father being himself and carrying my super medically fragile sister\u2019s life in her hands.  \nTalking about it all openly makes it not so bad.  If my mom were in denial about things, or making herself the martyr/victim I would absolutely resent her, and probably my sister too.  Something that would only hurt me.\n\nThe truth does matter and it changes everything.  There\u2019s a reason people are told that talking about it helps take away the power of your trauma.  OP needs their truth to be known so they can work toward healing.", "Attempting to have a real relationship with their mother is probably worth it. Even if it doesn't work out", ">  NT sidtet\n\nDo you know what this is?", "Thanks. Coffee hadn't kicked in yet.", "It's not Chronic PTSD?", "Yes without knowing the individuals entirely I also sympathise with the mother too. But perhaps just because I am a parent of a child with severe autism.", "Its hard to sympathize with a woman who thinks her child has CPTSD to spite her and who chose to put all of her children in situations that caused real and lasting harm because she was in denial.", "If only that was how PTSD and CPTSD worked.", "Guess it depends on the holiday but if someone there with me spent the whole time visibly stressed it'd definitely knock my personal enjoyment of the holiday too, even if I've got no real reason to be stressed.", "Exactly! She definitely wanted OP to play that assigned role in the conversation.\n\nIn her mind, it\u2019s OP\u2019s duty to validate the decisions she made as a parent, irrespective of OP\u2019s actual experiences or opinions.", "Maybe a bit of internalised guilt there over how bad it was, even if she can't bring herself to acknowledge that.", "My MIL is like this... I'm gonna guess that it's this exactly. She wanted OP to say that they weren't so bad, or even that they were good, so she could go on about how much she had to suffer to make it good for them.", "No, it\u2019s a term used in film, specifically screenwriting, when new information is introduced that changes established events. \n\nMy dad rewrites screenplays of his past in his head in the hopes the rest of us remember it that way.", "Retroactive Continuity. A literary device that basically changes the past in order to make it line up with the current narrative. Most typically in comic books.

Agreeing or disagreeing was a trap - the only way OP could have won this mindgame, is to have blown smoke up Mum's ass by simultaneously praising her for creating wonderful(!) holidays for everyone whilst also \"acknowledging\" that she singlehandedly sacrificed herself on the altar of Her Children to achieve that miracle.", "Agreed 100%", "This is my mom. She tries to preach at me and my wife for arguing banana acts like she and my father didn't cuss and scream at each other or hit one another.

It rewrites how the brain works- its basically a TBI without the head trauma.\n\n  \nCPTSD is caused by repeated traumatic events. Typical causes include child abuse,  living with an abusive partner, ect- basically living in terror for a signifigant chunk of time.", "Yeah, no. Good parents don't pretend that their children are choosing to have CPTSD to soothe their own egos when it's their failures as a parent that allowed it to happen.\n\nPTSD is basically a traumatic brain injure without the actual TBI- it's litterally a form of brain damage. CPTSD is caused by having that \"injury\" occur repeatedly.\n\nIt's like PTSD but worse.\n\nOPs parents failed all of their children, put them in danger of real and lasting harm, and caused real and lasting harm.", "Urgh. Just use regular words.  For the 95% of us who aren't, you know, in film, specifically screenwriting.", "Thank you for the additional clarification!", "She did slow down a little when I told her that the trashcan outside of the dog park is jealous of how full of dogshit she is.", "thanks", "I have a few psych degrees. I understand what it is. I also understand that that there is maternal PTSD associated with raising children with special needs or autism. No one is saying the mother knocked it out the park here. \n\nPTSD is awful\u2026 and what I\u2019m seeing in both of them (based solely on the OPs storytelling which is, necessarily, one sided) is the associated heightened reactions in some (mother and OP) and withdrawal in others (father, sister). \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with others perspectives, but yours isn\u2019t inherently more valid or correct. \n\n(And for what it\u2019s worth- you probably think I\u2019m a jerk for jumping in.
