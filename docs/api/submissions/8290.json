Why are you dating someone you are ashamed of ?! \n\nIf you are scared that a bartender girlfriend could hurt your career, spoiler alert : the problem is not the girlfriend.

YTA.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a good idea for her to be the server either, but because you wouldn\u2019t bring a girlfriend to a business meeting. And I wouldn\u2019t want my SO serving me secretly during a business meeting because it could distract me, make me slip out of my more formal mode, and just generally make me feel like I was being deceitful. \n\nSo many valid reasons for not wanting her to be your server that aren\u2019t asshole reasons.

My God your little dick energy is insane. She should be sad because you are clearly embarrassed by her. What she does for a living has no relation to what you do.

It's gotta be hard trying to fit in with people who aren't like you, who you don't necessarily like, and who you wouldn't necessarily hang out with outside of a work environment. \n\nPractically speaking though, if you keep the girl and the job long enough, someone's going to ask what she does and where she works. I think you should practice telling the truth now, and say it with pride and confidence. You have to be really good to keep a job at a high-end place like that, right? And she makes plenty of money. There's nothing to be ashamed of here, and if your bosses think there is, you might reconsider whether it's a place you really want to work at all. \n\nAll that said, I think you're better off getting someone else to serve. There's going to be a weird mixing of business/personal/business if she serves you, whether you acknowledge her as your girlfriend or not. You're either ignoring her, which gives off \"I'm ashamed of you\" vibes, or you treat her more familiarly than you would your average server, which might make your bosses feel like third wheels (which WOULD be detrimental to your job prospects).

I don\u2019t see why the comments are all talking about OP being ashamed of his GF when like nothing in this indicates that this is the case?", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. There needs to be a separation of work and home. If this is the restaurant and you have no say in it, then gf shouldn't be the server for the table if at all possible and between you, the company, gf, and the restaurant, things should be scheduled accordingly. It comes down to a conflict of interest issues on a business level, not a personal level. And business wise, this is inappropriate on all levels.", ">I'm not sure how my bosses or their clients would take to them knowing one on their team was dating a server.\n\nYTA, are you saying you don't have the guts to defend your gf if your clients criticized your gf's profession?", "Fucking gross. YTA", "YTA. \nThey aren't the ones with the issue with her. It's clearly you", "Are your bosses looking for a bar tender? Did they ask you to find one? Why didn't you just tell her it's covered? Take her as a date if it's a thing for significant others. Oh the dinner is being hosted at her place. Yeah, yta.", "Yta that was a lot of words to say you are ashamed of your girlfriend. Please do her a favor an leave her alone she deserves so much better", "Stopped reading at the title. YTA", "Be careful OP. You\u2019re on the path to becoming that which you claim to loathe. \n\nYTA", "YTA and kinda dumb tbh. I used to manage a fine dining place. The dude I was dating at the time would bring his clients in and we would pretend we weren\u2019t dating. He could brief me ahead of time and I would help wait on the table and let my server know what\u2019s up. Greet him on his way in \u201cHello Mr LASTNAME, nice to see you as always\u2014 your usual table?\u201d or have the server start small chat on topics that could lead the conversation in ways where he could chat with clients. \n\nYou basically degraded your gf and told her that her job would be looked down upon instead of teaming up with her\u2014 but I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t have that much faith in her to have thought of how this could be a good thing.", "OP this is a great way for you to observe your bosses character.  See how they treat someone you know very well.   Maybe you get a horndog boss who flirts with her nonstop. Who knows. \n\nBut yeah YTA. Always support your old lady, if you ashamed of her then wtf you doing with her.", "Wtf dude YTA she us a bartender, she doesnt sacrifice kids for satan. Noone would care", "YTA. I get it but why would you date someone who you don\u2019t think is your equal? Why do that to the woman?", "YTA.  She's much too good for you.", "You are literally the AH. Hope your gf realizes what an arse you are and leaves you.", "Let me guess. You\u2019re an overpaid banker who works in The City. Do you wear a pinstripe suit as well?", "Yes you are. Wow mindblown. Reread whst you just told us.", "Honestly, I knew OP was going to be the asshole the minute I read the word \u201cexpat\u201d. Call yourself what you are mate - an immigrant - just like everyone else who moves to another country to live. The term expat comes from the same illustrious history of classism/elitism/racism as your bosses\u2019 attitudes - it\u2019s literally just a way for wealthy, typically white immigrants to pretend they are somehow better and more glamorous than other immigrants. \n\nIt\u2019s sounds like you are paying lip service to the idea that your bosses have shitty values but that you actually just want to fit into their club. Classism is alive and well in the UK, but like racism and other garbage \u201cisms\u201d, it will only thrive while the rest of us pander to it. \n\nI can actually think of other reasons not to want your SO (or anyone you know) to be serving you at a business dinner - namely not wanting to be distracted from work, since you ARE essentially working during this dinner, but that\u2019s not the concern you express.\n\nTruthfully, I hope your girlfriend finds the self-worth to date someone else who isn\u2019t ashamed of her in any context. Personally, my self esteem would have to be on the floor to remain dating/sleeping with someone who was ashamed of what I do. \n\nYTA", "I doubt the bosses give a shit who he\u2019s dating or what she does for work.", "He didn\u2019t say he\u2019s ashamed of her job.\n\nHe said the company and sector he\u2019s in would dehumanise him for it. That\u2019s a real thing.\n\nDo you tell black people to just comply with police too? It\u2019s a similar parallel, OP cannot account for his company\u2019s biased ways. Judging OP for the ways of the world doesn\u2019t change it is that way.\n\nHe can lose his role/status in it for his gf to serve them - or he can introduce her as his gf (a server) in the appropriate setting as his date(at the next work function). Not by having her literally serve his colleagues.", "Not to mention that the people he's trying to impress may treat his gf badly while she's serving them.", "It doesn\u2019t even make sense of how she could hurt his career like wtf", "So succinct!", "He doesn't even know the bosses would react that way--he is just applying his own bias.  Kind of gross.", "I agree he\u2019s an asshole, but stop this nonsense regarding \u201cexpat\u201d vs \u201cimmigrant\u201d. Word meanings change over time and there are definitely nuances, but to act like there are no differences between the generally accepted meanings of those two words is just ignorant.", "You just compared black people facing lethal treatment from police to op potentially not getting ahead in the world of finance as quickly as he'd like to.\n\nGet a grip, mate.", "So you\u2019re trying to say that longer hours deserve more respect and that your job is \u2018more respectful\u2019 than hers because you work longer hours? Jeez, get off your high horse and stop pretending you don\u2019t have a superiority complex. Ugh.\nYTA", "Oh boy", "Unfortunately, I could believe this. I used to work in London and classism is alive and well. It might bring his cred down at work. But too bad - if he cares about this girl, it shouldn't matter. \n\nYTA", "He needs a new career if that is how his career requires him to act. Or he needs to let her find someone who will support her job with everyone they encounter.", "How are you managing to type with your head so far up your own ass? It really is quite remarkable.", "And?", "Hours work don\u2019t correlate to respectability. Making a lot of money working less hours is a flex. Working 50+ hours a week and having less leisure time is the furthest thing from a flex. And instead of justifying why your work is more respectable than hers why don\u2019t you stand up for her and say yeah ya know what she works hard etc. oh yeah because YTA and see yourself as better than her.", "I am black. We do adapt to scenarios at work similar to with police etc. Being black doesn\u2019t change cause you\u2019re not facing lethal blowback. In this case we get career stalls and dismissed ideas suddenly.\n\nMaybe you need perspective? I was hoping to offer that.\n\nFYI, I\u2019ve had execs literally grab my passport during a work trip, and ask how I possibly am living and working (as their equal) but never changed my passport? And they do not see how odd that is at all, I\u2019ve had execs dismiss my seniors to gawk and question my upbringing (instead of working). So trust me, had I said my bf is the one serving them - their perception of me tanks to the \u2018ghetto\u2019 scenes in their minds, as quickly as they\u2019re awed by my third-world passport.\n\nI\u2019ve also had a boss (who is \u2018woke\u2019) see me leaving the office with my beanie and headphones - suddenly she\u2019s clearly surprised and says \u2018wow, you look cool\u2019. Cause I dress professionally and talk like it, she\u2019d assumed I don\u2019t have flava I guess\u2026and it delighted her to see it\u2026. I don\u2019t even know. I am not cool otherwise? I just smiled and nodded and left. \n\nIt\u2019s mindblowing how people project their expectations/stereotypes of who they think you are etc. Don\u2019t dismiss OPs understanding of his peers.", "Don\u2019t know that omgg .. yeah and also he is the one judging her and thinking his boss will have a bad opinion about him because of her job (because he thinks that and believes everyone will think the same and he doesn\u2019t respect her )", "Apples/oranges.", "I'd like to see you do one shift in a restaurant", "Sure thing, both are fruit though right? That\u2019s all I meant."]}
