Holy shit, I can\u2019t say what I want because mods will get me, but I think your gf is waaaayyy too good for you.", "YTA. Why are you dating someone you are ashamed of ?! \n\nIf you are scared that a bartender girlfriend could hurt your career, spoiler alert : the problem is not the girlfriend. It's your asshole bosses and the fact that the way they see you is more important than the woman you are supposed to love..", "YTA.

DUH", "YTA\n\nI'll restrain myself from listing all the reasons why I think a person who is caught up by this is at least partly a bad buissiness man, but that is even besides the main point: It is the very basic groundline of respect and decency towards your partner to openly assume being with her. If you cannot do that, why are you with her at all?", "To summarize, you want to know if you are an asshole for being ashamed of your girlfriend\u2019s well paying job. Yes. YTA.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a good idea for her to be the server either, but because you wouldn\u2019t bring a girlfriend to a business meeting. And I wouldn\u2019t want my SO serving me secretly during a business meeting because it could distract me, make me slip out of my more formal mode, and just generally make me feel like I was being deceitful. \n\nSo many valid reasons for not wanting her to be your server that aren\u2019t asshole reasons. But being ashamed of her job? Tsk tsk tsk", "YTA and your girlfriend deserves better.

People who work at high-end restaurants are career servers, and it's a vocation that requires an enormous amount of practical knowledge combined with social finesse to do well. You should let your lady do her thing, show her expertise, and see what happens. If your coworkers don't treat her with decency and respect, then that will tell you more than a a few things about what line of work you're in.", "YTA. Yes being ashamed of your girlfriend\u2019s job makes you a bad partner. You want to seem big and bad like \u2018my bosses can go fuck themselves\u2019 but you don\u2019t mean it. ALL you care about in this situation is now things make YOU look. You\u2019ve given no thought to how this makes your girlfriend feel.", "Yes yes it does make you a bad partner and YTA. You look down at your girlfriend and her job even if you claim you don't. I'd be more than sad if I were her. I'd really be contemplating staying in a relationship with someone who looks down at my job and me as a result of it.", "YTA\n\nNobody cares. You're absurd.", "So not the asshole for not wanting her to serve you, but YTA I think for the reasons behind it. If they\u2019re seriously going to get rid of you because your partner is a server then you won\u2019t last there long term - are you planning to stay with her forever and also work there forever? Eventually they would meet. But personally I would not want my partner to be my server for a business function for other reasons (I would find it to be an uncomfortable power balance for my partner)", "Dude....WTF. YTA", "Yta. My God your little dick energy is insane. She should be sad because you are clearly embarrassed by her. What she does for a living has no relation to what you do. Also, depending on how high that place is, she could be bringing in bank. Yes you are a bad partner. Man up.

It is a different dynamic server to customer and some institutions are resistant to parity. This is a conversation about values, respect, career expectations, classism.

It's gotta be hard trying to fit in with people who aren't like you, who you don't necessarily like, and who you wouldn't necessarily hang out with outside of a work environment. \n\nPractically speaking though, if you keep the girl and the job long enough, someone's going to ask what she does and where she works. I think you should practice telling the truth now, and say it with pride and confidence. You have to be really good to keep a job at a high-end place like that, right? And she makes plenty of money. There's nothing to be ashamed of here, and if your bosses think there is, you might reconsider whether it's a place you really want to work at all. \n\nAll that said, I think you're better off getting someone else to serve. There's going to be a weird mixing of business/personal/business if she serves you, whether you acknowledge her as your girlfriend or not. You're either ignoring her, which gives off \"I'm ashamed of you\" vibes, or you treat her more familiarly than you would your average server, which might make your bosses feel like third wheels (which WOULD be detrimental to your job prospects). You're better off having someone else serve so that you can focus on business at dinner. You could always have her stop by so you can introduce her (and prove to everyone that you're NOT ashamed of her), but my vote is that you each do your jobs separately that night.\n\nI guess I vote YTA for valuing the opinions of your bosses over your girlfriend's feelings and achievements, but I recognize it's a tough spot for you to navigate.", "God imagine she was the server and the guys are all acting like entitled sexist fucking assholes and being creeps and remarking on her looks and body, either when she\u2019s there or not, and OP is just SITTING THERE because he won\u2019t/can\u2019t defend her because then these guys will learn he\u2019s dating, gasp, a server/bartender! \n\nNext post from OP: AITA for not standing up for my GF when the guys I work with were saying things about her and talking about how much they\u2019d like to fuck her?\n\nYTA OP", "YTA - what if she was a garbage collector and drove by one of their homes to pickup the trash?\n\nYou're about 2000 kinds of AH.", "YTA.

And, it\u2019s just awkward - nothing to do with her as a server, but just the logistics.  If they are doing business without spouses, how awkward to have her coming and going all evening.
