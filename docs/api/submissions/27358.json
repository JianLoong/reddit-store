{"id": 27358, "submission_id": "16ouzhy", "title": "AITA for calling my friend an insecure creep at a group hangout?", "selftext": "For some background information, my 28m wife 30f has a best friend, D 30m, who she has been friends with since she started college. He was the first friend she made at school and they've been close ever since. I always liked him and think he's a pretty chill guy. There's also another guy, P 31m, who's a friend I made at my job. Us 4 plus others are in a larger friend group of about 10. P is kinda new to the group, as I've just recently invited him. P also broke it off with his fianc\u00e9 (who he'd been with 6 years) about 2 months ago because he found out she was cheating with someone she claimed was \"just a friend.\" We have all tried to be supportive because we know that he is dealing with a lot because of that.\n\nAnyways, ever since the breakup, he has made some super rude comments about my wife and D. He's continually told to me that he thinks she's cheating with him and that I need to start investigating, but when I ask for any proof of this he just says \"if it happened to me it can happen to anybody.\" At first I tried to be sympathetic and just explain that I trust both of them and know there isn't anything going on, but it didn't stop. It seemed like he was constantly saying things like this to me, but I tried my best to ignore it.\n\nI didn't really care too much until he started doing it in front of the group. Me, D, and my wife would usually try to ignore it, but it seemed like that didn't work because it just kept getting worse. He kept making comments about how she was gonna leave me for him, she's probably in love with him, and other outlandish stuff. Usually, we just blow it off or laugh as if he's telling a joke, but the other day I think he took it too far.\n\nWhile all of us were having a board game night, P made the comment that my wife probably uses D for \"black dick\" since I obviously \"can't provide.\" (D and my wife are black, I'm white). This really pissed me off and I could tell my wife was mortified. I told P in front of everyone that he is an insecure creep who needs to get his shit together. Everyone kinda went silent and game night just kinda fizzled out after that. I felt guilty for ruining the atmosphere and texted my other friends apologizing. They all agree that P was out of line, but they think I only fueled it and made it more awkward when I should have ignored it. My wife and D have both told me they appreciate me standing up for them, but I still feel bad.

He's the only AH in this situation.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground, you did right.\n\nP was too far and he did it because out of kindness you let him.

P sounds like the separation made him super jaded, and I can get that. But there's a line, and he kept crossing it. Always nip these things in the bud.", "NTA. But honestly, you and your wife should\u2019ve put a stop to his remarks before it blew up like that. Your other friends didn\u2019t help by just remaining silent. Could you have handled it better? Probably. But after all his previous comments, I can understand why you kinda went off. \n\nExplain to your friends about all the comments he\u2019s made, even before he started saying them to the group. Honestly, if they agreed with you, they should\u2019ve spoken up as well. \n\nApologize to P but tell him his comments are inappropriate and unwanted. \n\nI hope you can mend fences.", "nta misery loves company and p is trying to make some by sabotaging your relationship. he might not even know he's doing this but, due to the lengths he's reached, i think he should be excluded from the group henceforth.", "NTA - He was being insecure, inappropriate, and racist. He deserved to be called out. He\u2019s going through a hard time and y\u2019all have been amazingly patient with him because of it, but his own experiences don\u2019t give him a pass to project onto others. This experience sounds like it\u2019s leading him to mistrust all women and healthy relationships as some sort of defense mechanism. \n\nHe needs therapy, because what he went through was horrible. But he also needs to be called out when he starts trying to make his problems everyone else\u2019s problems.", "NTA", "You are definitely NOT the asshole!", "Definitely NTA.\n\nHe had it coming. He needs some Fing therapy to get over his insecurities.", "NTA.  And that sounds kinda racist too tbh.", "NTA, he was behaving atrociously.

More people need to speak out against people like this. If someone's making the vibe not good like how P was, the vibe is already lost and someone needs to put their foot down. \n\nConfrontation can be difficult. Especially when it doesn't happen very often. I understand P's insecurities, but that is NO excuse to be a huge asshole and project your feelings onto someone like that.\n\nOP did the right thing. You're a good person for calling them out.\n\nPlus, that might be the thing P needed to hear to get his shit together. Some people need pushback to learn. Hopefully, he will and can grow. And then, hopefully, he will apologize to all three of you for those terrible comments."]}
