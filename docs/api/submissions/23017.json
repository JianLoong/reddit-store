She's just using you for social clout.\n\nYour family is messed up if they thing dumping kids on a 20 year old is a viable child care solution. Stand up for yourself and be ready for the blowback.

I hope you get paid for the time you do watch them, and if you're not you should demand it.  Family does not equal free babysitting", "Obviously NTA. Your family feels very free to commit your time. There's no reason for it except that they can.\n\nThis may be your best chance. Call it the straw that broke the camel's back and close the babysitting service altogether. Since your family doesn't seem to believe in moderation, you don't have to, either.\n\nYes, they'll scream and try to guilt you, but taking care of their kids is the parents' responsibility, not yours.
