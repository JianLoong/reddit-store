And when not working or in class, you are studying at the library or out with YOUR friends.    \nYou are allowed to say no.\n\nYou are allowed to have a life.", "NTA", "NTA- You didn't knock them up so why are you obligated to watch their kids. Tell them NO.. it's their problem to find child care stop being their go to nanny. And your mom raised her kids not her responsibility to raise their kids too. They are taking advantage of you and your mom. Stand your ground dont be anyone's doormat", "NTA\n\nUnfortunately you won't change their judgemental toxic attitudes.\n\nStop accommodating them, and maintain your own boundaries", "NTA \n\nStart having plans where you're physically not there so they can't be dumped on you.\n\nThe entitlement of some people, honestly.", "NTA.  Those aren't your kids.", "NTA. Stop watching all of the children now! Please just do this for yourself. Cut off communication and enforce this boundary. Your family's lack of responsible reproductive practices is not a debt you need to or should pay. Your \"family\" are being absolutely ridiculous and abusive which is not the behavior of actual loved ones.", "NTA. You\u2019re 100% right, you shouldn\u2019t have to face the consequences of their decisions. I\u2019d be looking to move out as soon as possible (assuming it\u2019s feasible)", "NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys. The parents all need to sort their child care out. You also need to put your foot down firmly on this and say no to them all. You may be at home but you are working, not sitting around. You\u2019re also studying. After all that, you are entitled to your free time.", "You\u2019re NTA. Now, my sister helped me tremendously when I was fresh off my divorce with 2 young kids (like 1 and 3) and starting a business. She basically babysat for free for almost 2 years and I was soooo freaking thankful. As soon as I was able to provide for my boys and have some extra $$$. I took her on a Disney cruise as a thank you and hired a babysitter. If you don\u2019t think your siblings will ever reciprocate\u2026then start charging them and make yourself unavailable when they ask.", "NTA\n\nBut, do you live in your own place? If you have your own place, it's easier to put your foot down. Tell them that you aren't going to babysit anymore and don't answer the door. (Make sure no one else has a key.) You could even be elsewhere like go work at a Barnes and Noble or a Starbucks till they get used to you not being the babysitter.\n\nAs a really drastic measure, you could move and not tell them your new address.\n\nBut if you're still living with your mom, that's going to be a lot harder to enforce.", "NTA. Not your kids, not your responsibility. I recommend that you move out of that environment as soon as you realistically can, because I highly doubt they\u2019re ever going to see it your way and you don\u2019t need that kind of constant pressure to be undermining your work on your own life goals.", "You need to move out and not give them the address. While you move out You need a door with a lock and learn how to say no. As soon as your done with work leave the house. If your not there they can leave their kids there. Start charging them three times what sitters cost there and charge them up front. Then start learning to say \u201cno and if you leave them here I will call the cops on you for child abandonment\u201d. They are using them because you let them so stop letting them.", "You are 20 , say no or deal with it. It is literally up to you.", "Yeah, if you're living with Mom, are you paying rent? If not, consider the childcare your rent payment. If you are paying rent, it's time to move out.", "\u2018Oh, you\u2019re single and child free? Excellent! You can babysit!\u2019\n\nUm, no. I\u2019ve set my life up this way for a reason, thanks. Right now I\u2019m concentrating on working and studying, and then using my free hours to enjoy all the leisure activities I can find time/money for. And yes, I have time and money for them, because I chose not to have kids right now. No, I don\u2019t want to give them up for *your* kids. That would defeat the purpose of all my choices.", "Nannying often is. $20/hour per child.", "So, OP needs to charge $40/hr per kid", "NTA.  These people should be swapping child care with EACH OTHER instead of relying completely on you. \n\nYou need to study on weekends, right? YES YOU DO. \n\nTell your sisters and your mom that you are available for two hours or whatever you are actually willing to do on whichever day. And then be firm about not being available other than that. Very firm. Tell them you\u2019re studying extra hard for midterms or finals. It\u2019ll take them a while to adjust. \n\nTell them you\u2019re working more hours. \n\nTell them you need a break, too. \n\nTell them whatever you want but start setting boundaries.", "I\u2019ll never understand those that can\u2019t figure out birth control or the true responsibility and weight of having children. \n\nOn that note, if your mom wants to watch everyone\u2019s offspring- more power to her. But you are under no obligation to raise someone else\u2019s children - especially since this sounds forced and pay is not discussed. \n\nYou have your own life to live and should you - out of the kindles of your heart- choose to babysit to give someone a break, that\u2019s your prerogative. \n\nI suggest you refuse, keep going to school, invest in your future, and let them know their inability to keep their legs shut is not your problem (I\u2019m sure there are nicer ways to say it lol)\n\nNTA", "NTA. Consider offering your services for the same price as daycare services. You're basically an emergency daycare at this point, so feel free to bump up the prices for that.", "NTA. Start refusing to care for any children if you do not want to. You have the right to downtime. Their decision to have children does not make them your responsibility.", "NTA It doesn't sound like you live at home, you work from home, and you do school online it is time to move too far away to babysit for anyone. Like Yesterday!", "NTA.\n\nYou need to leave the house immediately after finishing your work, if not sooner - do your work from home at the library, or a friend's house, or a coffee shop, or anywhere else.", "You need to polish up that spine of yours and make it a shiny steel spine, start saying no.  No is a complete sentence.  Stop babysitting.  \n\nDo you live with your parents? If so, move out.  If you don\u2019t, change your locks and make sure people don\u2019t have keys and don\u2019t open the doors for people dropping off the kids.", "NTA, if you don\u2019t live with your mom then you have every right to not watch anyone else\u2019s kids. They are using you as a doormat they won\u2019t stop till you grow a spine and say no.", "Bless you for not knowing how shitty controlling people work.", "NTA. You are not the family babysitter! Distance yourself and set some boundaries.", "NTA.  I would look for other living arrangements (different place, perhaps with roommates), because as long as you are physically around, they will dump their kids on you and run.", "NTA. They are not your kids to look after. Start sticking firm with your no. Don't let them guilt into watching them. Its their own fault for having kids with no plans. I would start casually sending them daycare bear where they live whenever they ask you to babysit. Hopefully they get the idea", "NTA but you need to move so you can focus on your needs. You don't exist to be a free babysitter", "Oh, and charge a rate that you would be happy to come back the next day. They want you to sacrifice your time, but don't sacrifice your dignity or self worth. \n\nWhen I was 8-14 I would shovel sidewalks when it snowed. When they asked what I'd charge, I would tell them \"I usually get $1/inch $2 if I do the driveway, but you pay me what you think I'm worth.\" Well I did a really good job and got what I asked and often a tip on top of it. But occasionally I'd get shorted at 1/2 or more. Then guess where  I didn't stop after the next snowstorm. You won't have my advantage of being able to not show up, so I'd check out what a babysitter costs and add $5/hr. Then if they tick you off you can hire another babysitter and pocket the change for a service charge.\n\nNTA", "Your last statmement is right. Not your kid. Not your problem", "NTA.", "Back before COVID I'd work from home periodically, and my wife was always trying to have me run errands, or do some kind of chores, and I'd have to remind her that I was working not taking a day off.\n\nNow we both work from home and that's the end of that", "NTA, you working from home doesn\u2019t mean you can look after a child. You still gotta render hours in without any interruptions other than meal and toilet breaks. They\u2019re AHs for even considering you to be their son\u2019s carer in the morning.", "NTA tell your familly that maybe you ll not be single if they could take care of their child properly and that if you don't have child it's not for taking care of other's it's a choice sister and cousin made their's. \n\nFor the one who critisized you, tell them that they are free to help by themselve. You are an adult, do what YOU want.", "NTA. If you live at home. Save. Move out. \n\nIf you already have your own place. Don\u2019t open the door. Change the locks if people have keys. Tell them you\u2019re now starting to work from the office or somewhere so you won\u2019t be home to look after the kids and then just don\u2019t answer the door if they come knocking. \n\nI have two nephews and a niece and until recently I was a teacher so had all the school holidays off. Even then I said I\u2019d only have the kids one day a week because that\u2019s my break too but that one day a week was appreciated by them. \n\nI\u2019m no longer teaching and now work from home too but I\u2019ve said i can no longer have the kids, sorry.", "NTA, if you wanted to look after kids all the time, you'd have your own."]}
