Even if she felt offended or attacked, she smokes, she knows she stinks and if it'S such an issue, she simply needs to quit. And before people come at me, the truth is ya'll smokers STINK. Even with perfume and washing hands etc, it SMELLS sooo strong. I know many people can't smell themselves but to everyone around them, it smells and that's the simple truth.", "NTA. Smokers smell awful, that's something they (and the people around them, unfortunately) just have to deal with.", "NTA. Previous smoker and present anxiety-haver here - the smell of smoke is viscerally alarming, and smokers know on some level that they smell like smoke. I\u2019ve had that same thing happen to me, and the easy way to dismiss the \u201coh god it smells like smoke I\u2019m having a stroke or we are in danger\u201d chatter of strangers is literally just to go \u201coh, it\u2019s probably me, because I smoke.\u201d You just said that it smells like smoke.

And I'm actually surprised with the amount of comments saying she's NTA because smokers stink. I'm a smoker and agree that smokers stink but they don't smell like fire smoke AT ALL. \n\nIf you're messing those odors up you better check what's wrong with your nose. But I'm pretty sure you just wanted to make a snarky observation.\n\nYTA.", "You're right that it doesn't smell like fire smoke, but I kind of doubt a fire in elevator wiring would smell like fire smoke, either. \n\nI can kind of see how if someone (like a younger person who grew up in a no- smoking era where most people vape) smelled cigarette smoke for the very first time, their mind might go to the smell of burning chemical/ electrical components, and they might think safety issue. \n\nI do think, tbh, that it's highly unlikely they honestly didn't recognize the rather distinctive smell of cigarette smoke -- especially since OP says she's \"hardly ever\" been around cigarette smoke, which (naturally) indicates she has been exposed to it.  I distinctly remember the first time I smelled cigarette smoke as a child: I was about 12 years old, walking home from the library with my sister, and I smelled this awful stink on the breeze. I looked around, saw someone walking behind us smoking a cigarette, and put one and two together. The next time I smelled that smell while out walking, I began choking and coughing dramatically (like an a-hole teenager) and complaining loudly about the smell. It's a distinctive and immediately recognizable scent.  \n\nThat's why I think OP was trying to passively aggressively shame the smoker, but ultimately the judgement comes down to what OP says, and according to OP they have had the privilege of enjoying such a safe and sheltered life experience up to this point that they literally can't differentiate between different types of burning/ smoke smells. She probably would also freak out if someone returning from a camping excursion and smelling of woodsmoke was in the elevator.", "I'm very glad I can't smell you over reddit because it must be overpowering.

I still smell smoke and wish I could smoke. It's just a passing thought now TG.", "I think it probably depends on the situation but an enclosed elevator with a few people? Come on now.
