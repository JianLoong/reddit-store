You\u2019re wife isn\u2019t on the same page as you when it comes to assigning chores for your boys. So much so that she will do things preemptively before they have a chance to try. Not even that they don\u2019t do it soon enough and she just does it. But she is almost outmaneuvering your kids in their household chores. And she often undermines you when you do assign tasks. You have mentioned giving up.

Fortunately, my husband and I had a private talk about the kids pulling more weight and why he thought it was important.  Kids will balk at having new chores, etc., but teaching them how to do the chores and then expecting them to get done teaches responsibility and that working together improves family bonds.\nWe sat the kids down and explained that, as they were older, they would be responsible for several more chores.  Of course, this was not great news to them, but we just took a matter-of-fact stance with it, ignored grumbles and let them take over some of what I\u2019d previously done for them.  Cleaning standards slipped a little, but if a chore seemed to have been genuinely attempted, then it was all good.  Rare occasions required a redo.\nYour wife will have to decide that the few minutes of extra cleaning effort on your boys\u2019 part will benefit them a lot in the future, and will have no effect on them \u201cbeing kids\u201d.", "NTA\n\n\nYour older son is 17.

There's a great book called \"fair play\" that goes into much greater detail and can help you guys really divide things more evenly, if they are lopsided.", "So what's stopping the wife from telling HER sons to help out with HER work? Instead, she just does everything for them and then grumbles about it.", "She\u2019s specifically stopping them from doing her share. Are you suggesting he just go behind her back?", "Could be she feels like they shouldn\u2019t be made to do those things even though they\u2019re clearly not incapable of having house chores.", "If this is true, why have you not sat them down and instructed them that from here on out, they will be doing X chores every single week and they are to complete them without their mother having to nag them. These aren't little kids. You might need to remind them because they are teens, but they should be able to competently complete the chores you are describing. The older one is going to go off to college in a year. You should really be teaching him these life skills, not having mommy clean his room.", "I do agree with this. I do think the wife is doing more work here and I would also pick the \u201chalf\u201d he has outlined. Grocery shopping when done well also can be a pleasure since you get to pick out snacks or get a magazine or even eat samples while you shop and if you bring headphones it can even be meditative. \n\nWhile I think OP only needs a small adjustment to include another task or two that\u2019s weekly I think frankly that some of these tasks should be the boys responsibility. Why aren\u2019t they in-charge of dusting, sweeping and trash? I mean they need to keep their rooms and bathrooms clean, but they also need to be in the habit of doing weekly tasks that they take ownership of. It\u2019s now or never and teaching them to be responsible and team players will make their lives and any future romantic partnerships that much easier.", "I handle most of the mental load in my house, I' just better at it than my wife. So she does more of the chores in exchange.  I handle the mental load stuff, all the cooking, grocery shopping and tidying up during the week. My wife does all the other chores and most of the errands. It works out to be fairly equal time wise. We do parenting 50/50 as much as life allows."]}
