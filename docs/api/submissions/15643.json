I handle about 75% of the homework help and she about 25%.  In the yard I am responsible for mowing and she for weeding and edging.\n\nThe issue is that she doesn\u2019t make the boys (17 and 13) really do anything and so ends up doing it all for them - cleaning their bathrooms, their bedrooms, picking up after them, etc.  Because of this she gets irritated at times, feeling like she does too much of the work.  We\u2019ve had conversations about it and I am firm that I\u2019m not going to do more just because she won\u2019t make the boys clean up after themselves.

So maybe re-evaluating time commitment (particularly including cooking, cleaning time, home maintenance, weekly cleaning, etc) is worth the time. \n\nHowever I think key information is being left out. You\u2019re wife isn\u2019t on the same page as you when it comes to assigning chores for your boys. So much so that she will do things preemptively before they have a chance to try. Not even that they don\u2019t do it soon enough and she just does it. But she is almost outmaneuvering your kids in their household chores. And she often undermines you when you do assign tasks. You have mentioned giving up.

Fortunately, my husband and I had a private talk about the kids pulling more weight and why he thought it was important.  Kids will balk at having new chores, etc., but teaching them how to do the chores and then expecting them to get done teaches responsibility and that working together improves family bonds.\nWe sat the kids down and explained that, as they were older, they would be responsible for several more chores.  Of course, this was not great news to them, but we just took a matter-of-fact stance with it, ignored grumbles and let them take over some of what I\u2019d previously done for them.

If these most fundamental life skills are neglected in the home, kids will either stay stuck at home after high school, or they go off to college to become the worst possible roommate imaginable. I have seen young people (especially young men) living in absolute SQUALLER because they were never taught the most fundamental skills of how to cook and clean. \n\nYour wife\u2019s hesitation may be coming from not wanting to take the time to teach these skills.

She is not doing them any favors.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not going to do more because she doesn\u2019t make the kids do chores? So you consider yourself one of the children and want your responsibilities to be on par with theirs? You\u2019re a complete asshole.", "EAH \n\nYour boy is about to go to move out into a roommate situation and have a HARD TIME adjusting because his roomates WILL think he\u2019s a huge AH. You and your wife need to both get on the same team to prevent that.", "Kids are capable of doing chores, but there is still going to be an element of management to ensure they get done and get done correctly.", "Alternately, he insists they clean their rooms", "What? I assume he is, but then she just does it for them.", "Ah, yes, the typical \"ThE wOmAn Is AlWaYs RiGhT, eVeN iF sHe BeHaVeS cOmPlEtElY bRaInDeAd\" response on Reddit. If a man hurts a woman, it's the man's fault, if the woman hurts herself, it's the man's fault and let us especially not forget that if a man respects the autonomy of a woman and she does something stupid, it's also the man's fault, because if you listen to people on here, a man is supposed to both worship his wife and beat the ever-living crap out of her to avoid being the asshole \ud83e\udd23", "Their mom is a big girl, she can speak for herself.  And per OP's comments it seems like she's undermined OP's attempts to get them to do that work.", "He literally said she doesn't want them doing chores and she just wants them to be kids. Sounds like mom just wants to spoil them and taking it out on dad. How is he the asshole here? He even says she got mad about him getting them to mow the lawn. He's not responsible for her shitty and enabling choices.", "Such an idiotic take. Why does this have so many up votes. Did people not read the post. If she is the one complaining about picking up after the she is the one who should let them do chores. The gender bias of this sub shows in posts like this one.", "in a nutshell.", "She really needs to stop and think about their future. Learning to clean up after oneself is a life skill. Their future partners would definitely appreciate if they could do this.", "Seriously!!! Thinking the kids should do chores is valid but irrelevant because this is a question of balancing our responsibilities between the parents.", "The leading by example part is an important point.", "If she is, in fact, stopping the boys from doing some cleaning, then she is doing a very big disservice", "Without the additional information, it\u2019s easy to think it\u2019s his fault and this is why. Getting kids to do chores is a massive chore in and of itself. It is sooooooo much easier to do it yourself. You teach them because you\u2019re a good parent who wants to raise competent adults, but it is a hassle and not at all helpful for a long time. \n\nKids fight you tooth and nail on doing chores. The mental load of it falls on you: you have to build a routine for them of when they\u2019re expected to do it and then you have to remind them every time. And that is usually followed by resistance (\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d \u201cI hate doing X\u201d \u201cMy room is clean\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d). So then you have to build a rewards and/or consequence system in (\u201cYou can\u2019t go out with friends if your room isn\u2019t clean\u201d \u201cYou can have screen time once the dishes are done\u201d). And then you have to teach them how to do it properly and reinforce it repeatedly until they\u2019ve mastered it. \n\nI am literally in the midst of this process as I type this. My kindergartner doesn\u2019t want to unload the dishwasher. He wants to do it after school (half day). He\u2019s hungry and wants chips. I could have his half unloaded in 2 minutes without the aggravation and it would be so much easier, but he needs to learn to be responsible. \n\nTeaching kids to do chores is as big of a job as doing homework with kids. So expecting her to just \u201cmake them do chores\u201d is a huge ask. \n\nNow, she actively sabotages his efforts to teach them, which we didn\u2019t know originally, so all of that is moot. But, without the comments, it looked much more like another case of a man foisting mental work into his wife without even acknowledging that the mental work is even real. In reality, he\u2019s doing the mental work and she is undoing it as fast as she can, which is a parenting difference at best but more likely an a-hole move on her side.", "Try reading \"Fair Play\" by Eve Rodsky. It's possible that your wife is doing more of the mental load, even if you're splitting the time evenly. (And I agree with the other comments, that your 'half' sounds easier than hers.) Some examples of mental load - planning birthday parties, planning dinners, buying clothes for the kids seasonally, helping them with homework, organizing outings (with friends, with the kids, date nights, with family), bills, mail, communicating with teachers, making sure the medicine cabinet is stocked, deciding if someone needs to stay home from school or see a doctor... There's a lot more tasks than the ones you've mentioned, and much of that kind of work is typically done by women.\n\nHave you asked her why she takes over for the boys after you've asked them to do something? Maybe she thinks they don't do it well enough, but doesn't have the capacity right now to teach them how to do it better. Or maybe she thinks you'll start to resent her if she isn't doing all of 'her half' of the chores - you mentioned she seems annoyed when you ask your kids to do some of 'your half'. Sounds like it's time for a redistribution of chores, and include the boys in that conversation.", "Your wife is doing them a huge disservice by not teaching them how to look after their things and maintain a house. \n\nHave you asked her why she isn't preparing them for independent living?", "Seriously!!", "Your kids should absolutely be doing chores around the house. Your wife is enabling them to be little pampered pets. We clean up after our pets because they can\u2019t clean up for themselves. Your kids are smarter than a pet.", "Are you serious? Lmao let me get this straight, ops wife is out there actively undermining his parenting and coddling the kids and that is somehow OPs fault completely and he's the asshole? Are you for real\n\nHoly crap, looking at your comment history nevermind, you're a terminal online aita user, that explains the complete lack of critical thinking skills. OP if you're reading this, please ignore this person", "There's nothing wrong with your post, OP. Its just nearly a guarantee that people will read the worst possible scenario into most AITA posts if you don't write it *perfectly*.", "You need to have a talk with your wife. Because she isn't doing those boys any favors by micro managing them.", "Kids answer shop.\n\nDad: clean your room\nKid: Maaa! Do I have to?\nMom: no you are my special angel.\nMom: husband, why do I have extra work?!", "This has to be the most stereotypical /r/AmItheAsshole thread of all time lol", "Or are a man. Let's be honest most of the comments just saw the words man and chores and made their decision he was wrong no matter what", "This. I think we all have stories about that kid in college or a roommate who was never taught the basics of life. I had a classmate in college who set a washing machine on fire because he tried to do all his laundry at once, packing it all in, and it burned out the agitator belt. Worse, our laundry fees were included in our housing fee so the machines were free to use and there were plenty of them. \n\nThe next time I was home I pulled my younger brother aside and taught him how to do laundry. \n\nDon\u2019t let your kids become that guy.", "Exactly me and my girls 15 and 13 cook all the time together talk, laugh and just have a good time. My girls love it.", "He could insist all he wants that they clean their own rooms", "5 years from now son will be posting \u201cMy partner says I don\u2019t help with any chores, but I never learned how to do any cleaning because my mom did it for me. AITA?!\u201d", "So OP is supposed to leave work and take the kids out of school so that they can get chores done while the wife is otherwise occupied? because it's pretty standard for everyone to be home around the same time, unless someone is working graveyards.", "She's not doing all of the housework. Plus he says they have a robot vacuum cleaner, so one of her responsibilities has already been taken away. \n\nThe husband has done his fair share, and he's done his part in getting his sons to do their chores. The wife also has a responsibility to parent her sons and get them to do their part, instead she just moans about it while enabling them.", "Assuming laundry includes putting it away, that is DEFINITELY not the fastest chore. I can clean my entire house in the same time it takes me to mow, so that's ALSO not the fastest chore (this one will vary on size of yard).", "I see you don't do housework either.", "These people literally just saw a man say something about chores and started frothing at the mouth. They didn't read the whole post. They just saw an opportunity to screech man bad and will make up whatever else they need to get there.", "So how long would it also take to weed and do edge work on the huge lawn?", "Quite frankly, I wouldn\u2019t care if the roles were reversed. Whoever is just doing laundry and groceries is getting off way too easy.", "And how exactly have you come to that conclusion?", "Maybe just maybe they are divided into who likes doing what. I dislike laundry. I\u2019d rather do dishes", "Because your comment shows, that you have no idea what it means to vacuum.", "And so from your comment I'm guessing you have idea what it means to mow the lawn or do the laundry?"]}
