She handles the general house cleaning including the bathrooms, dusting, vacuuming (though we have robot vacs so not much to do there), polishing the floors, etc.  She does about 75% of the cooking, though when she cooks I end up being her sous chef, and I do about 25%.  I handle about 75% of the homework help and she about 25%.  In the yard I am responsible for mowing and she for weeding and edging.\n\nThe issue is that she doesn\u2019t make the boys (17 and 13) really do anything and so ends up doing it all for them - cleaning their bathrooms, their bedrooms, picking up after them, etc.  Because of this she gets irritated at times, feeling like she does too much of the work.  We\u2019ve had conversations about it and I am firm that I\u2019m not going to do more just because she won\u2019t make the boys clean up after themselves.

And I do think that cleaning and polishing floors (including dusting, vacuuming, etc) is more time consuming than laundry and the grocery store. So maybe re-evaluating time commitment (particularly including cooking, cleaning time, home maintenance, weekly cleaning, etc) is worth the time. \n\nHowever I think key information is being left out. You\u2019re wife isn\u2019t on the same page as you when it comes to assigning chores for your boys. So much so that she will do things preemptively before they have a chance to try. Not even that they don\u2019t do it soon enough and she just does it. But she is almost outmaneuvering your kids in their household chores. And she often undermines you when you do assign tasks. You have mentioned giving up. That\u2019s not ok because you are condoning her not ensuring your boys are responsible adults in the future and it\u2019s your job to make it clear that you are unwilling to let your boys go out into the world not knowing how to be team players at home. \n\nSo get your wife on the same page as you and make sure your boys learn how to be responsible team players. Especially your 17 year old since you only have a short period of time to instill in him the idea that he needs to contribute his fair share and not expect his mother or g-d forbid a future partner in his life to do it for him. \n\nGet moving dad, it\u2019s now or never.

Fortunately, my husband and I had a private talk about the kids pulling more weight and why he thought it was important.  Kids will balk at having new chores, etc., but teaching them how to do the chores and then expecting them to get done teaches responsibility and that working together improves family bonds.\nWe sat the kids down and explained that, as they were older, they would be responsible for several more chores.  Of course, this was not great news to them, but we just took a matter-of-fact stance with it, ignored grumbles and let them take over some of what I\u2019d previously done for them.

If these most fundamental life skills are neglected in the home, kids will either stay stuck at home after high school, or they go off to college to become the worst possible roommate imaginable. I have seen young people (especially young men) living in absolute SQUALLER because they were never taught the most fundamental skills of how to cook and clean. \n\nYour wife\u2019s hesitation may be coming from not wanting to take the time to teach these skills.

Getting kids to do chores is a massive chore in and of itself. It is sooooooo much easier to do it yourself. You teach them because you\u2019re a good parent who wants to raise competent adults, but it is a hassle and not at all helpful for a long time. \n\nKids fight you tooth and nail on doing chores. The mental load of it falls on you: you have to build a routine for them of when they\u2019re expected to do it and then you have to remind them every time. And that is usually followed by resistance (\u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d \u201cI hate doing X\u201d \u201cMy room is clean\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d).

My kindergartner doesn\u2019t want to unload the dishwasher. He wants to do it after school (half day). He\u2019s hungry and wants chips. I could have his half unloaded in 2 minutes without the aggravation and it would be so much easier, but he needs to learn to be responsible. \n\nTeaching kids to do chores is as big of a job as doing homework with kids.
