It\u2019s honestly embarrassing for me because i used to be the golden child and they all thought i was gonna do really well at school and all that because i wanted to be a doctor \n\nSo my aunt\u2019s wedding was 2 weeks ago and even though things are bad she told me that i\u2019m still family and she invited me because we used to be kinda close because she\u2019s only 6 years older than me and i used to think of her as a sister. I had plans to go and was even at a family meet up before it a few weeks ago but everybody just looked at me differently. They were all super distant even though i tried to speak with them and it\u2019s like everybody ignored me or judged me\n\nSo i thought okay i won\u2019t go to the wedding it\u2019s too embarrassing anyway if my parents are just gonna be making things up about me. So i didn\u2019t go.

Please get into therapy and try to get sober again. Take care of you and then try to work on family relationships.", "NAH.  I don't fault you for feeling uncomfortable in family settings, but I wonder if you have mis-read the emotions of your family.  They are likely just as uncomfortable as you are.  No one knows what to say.  It sounds like your aunt was reaching out and felt hurt that you bailed on the wedding.  Apologize to your aunt, by letter if she won't pick up your calls right now.

However Ik thats easier said than done and dont blame you for skipping. Good luck with life though, ik it may seem hopeless but it\u2019s not impossible.", "YTA with the specific question about skipping the wedding and this is due to there seemed to be no attempt to let her know prior to this.  You are still in the grips of the addiction which distorts perspective.  I will say this however, the fact that you skipped out on the wedding showed your cousin the exact state that you are in no matter if you intended to do so or not. I believe your action killed any illusion or hope your cousin had that you were recovering or on a good road to recovery.  As you stated, that you saw her like a sister and it would be logical that she saw you in the same light.   \n\n\nYou still have a lot of things to think about if you truly want to recover and be sober.  It's clear since there are a lot of excuses listed in your post (also understandable with someone with an addiction).  To me, all of your family's reactions are not out of the ordinary.

Are there any support groups like NA near you that could be a resource? Best of luck!", "YTA you should have gone.  The way you feel is going to naturally put you on a semipermanent defensive.  You need to own what you did (not saying you aren't ) and show everyone you are working damn hard to stay sober.  Good luck.", "Your family are afraid.. so naturally they are gonna watch you when you are all together..

That said, it wasn\u2019t a wise move and you missed an opportunity. Showing up and behaving like a good guest would have helped quell whatever your parents said about you by showing how completely typical/boring you are vs some criminal mastermind. By not showing up, you fed into the unreliable addict character they tried portraying you as. Your aunt kind of stuck her neck out for you and you stood her up.", "Not sure if this is appropriate.

You COULD have handled this better with a proactive apology prior to non-attendance, but this is the next best thing.  That's the best you can do, and I'm so sorry.

Sometimes it's just genetic predisposition.

Have you had a relative who was an addict? I have, and it\u2019s really hard. Asking questions about rehab and seeming distant are just part of the process to rebuild the previous relationship.", "To be honest, I didn't think this post was going to stay up but wanted to at least encourage toward recovery some more before comments were locked. Addiction is definitely a LOT more complicated than I made it sound. As a recovering one myself, I've learned it's a mine field of all kinds of things. I'm glad you clarified. Thank you.", "Thx", "I didn't either!", "Hey OP, I know you feel like you know what you're doing and you're mature and an adult, I did too at 19. You're the oldest you've ever been, so you can't see how young you really are. But you are naive.\n\n\nAddiction is hard and it's horrible. And you have all of my empathy, I've been in withdrawals I know how horrendously unbearable that can be. But with all due respect you are acting like a child.\n\n\nYou have a serious drug addiction, *of course* people are going to judge you and see you differently. It sucks and maybe it's not fair, but it's the reality of things. You can't expect everything to be like it used to be before people knew, especially if you're not sober.\n\n\nBut, and this is important, people seeing you in a different light doesn't mean they don't still love you and want you around. Your aunt wanted you at her wedding, she was trying to extend some love and friendship to you and by not going and not telling her in advance that you wouldn't be there you have thrown that back in her face. I know that wasn't your intention, but that is how it will feel to her. YTA for that, but not for feeling how you feel.\n\n\nYour understanding of social and interpersonal interactions is lacking, this is where your youth comes into things. You don't have the life experience to know how to navigate the suddenly very adult situations that your addiction has thrust you into. You also haven't expressed any desire to become or remain sober in your post which makes it hard to offer you advice, you need therapy my love I know it's probably not what you want to hear but it really will help. If you want help. You can't fix or change any of this if you don't want help.", "NTA, and good for you. Focus on what you need to do. \u2018You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup\u2019, it\u2019s ok to be selfish while you face all your trials", "YTA. You should have told her beforehand that you weren't going. Wedding guests cost money due to the cost of food and drinks at the reception. And instead of feeling sorry for yourself, work on your sobriety. You can take steps to change your life. So do it. It won't be easy, but it will make your life better.", "YTA. I understand where you were coming from I really do. Coming from a former addict myself. Your family doesn\u2019t trust you and a lot of people are ignorant about drug use so they judge. It sucks but it\u2019s just how it is. Your aunt wanted you there and I think you should\u2019ve showed up. I didn\u2019t want to show my face either after what I put my parents thru in my addiction. I knew my family knew what was going on so when I showed up again it was so fucking hard. But I stayed clean and me and my family are close again. Good luck OP. I know it\u2019s hard but I hope you can get sober before something bad happens. With fentanyl going around using is more dangerous then ever.", "No judgement, because there's a lot of missing information here. You were only sober for two months? Meaning that you were not sober at the last gathering. I feel like something happened at that gathering and you, not being sober, didn't notice.\n\nAlso I'm a bit sceptical of the fact that they're fasley accusing you of being a thief. You're saying you've been addicted for five years to opioids and you never ever stole drugs, or money/possessions to buy them? How does a teenager afford that without theft? \n\nAre they even judging you at all? You're 19 and went to rehab and you expect people to not mention it at all? Even when you've since relapsed? Seems like they might be acting out of care, not judgement.", "NAH, but you may have misinterpreted your aunt acting a little weird and talking too much about your rehab.\n\nShe still considered herself close enough with you to want you to go to the wedding when the rest of the family is cutting you out.\n\nShe was likely focused on your rehab because she actually cares about you, hasn\u2019t written you off. and hopes things turn around for you.", "It seems like none of these people are really supporting you in this. They tried to ship you off to solve the problem and when it didn\u2019t they basically washed their hands of you. They all seem pretty toxic. You did what you needed to do for YOU  - no one else matters. It\u2019s not easy navigating sobriety. You need to surround yourself with those who will support you. Not those who will shit on you. \n\nNTA", "YTA. Your aunt was trying to be nice and reached out to you, and you just dismissed her. You don't seem like you want any help, so just get used to feeling miserable, because that is what you are choosing every day. You need to get your shit together. But you know that.", "Sorry you got downvoted. I (also a recovering alcoholic) completely agree with you. I think unless people have experienced addiction for themselves it\u2019s very hard for them to understand.", "There's no evidence OP is trying to kick her addiction.", "I\u2019ve worked as a therapist and as a social worker, and I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, that you can be an addict with no underlying issues. I\u2019ve never heard of a treatment program or philosophy that doesn\u2019t involve addressing underlying issues. You should read about or watch the YouTube video for \u201cRat Park.\u201d I\u2019ve personally found that addicts generally have trauma that they\u2019re using substances to avoid facing.", "There are genetic predispositions for all kinds of things, including addictions. But there is always a trigger, and there are always underlying issues. Sorry but it does not always have to be a struggle and one does not always have to be an addict.", "NTA, it is a fucked up thing, that they expected you, to attend the wedding, while being shunned at the same time.", "NAH. Drug or alcohol addiction is a very difficult thing to kick. I hope that someday you'll be able to overcome this.\n\nMy brother is an alcoholic. I had to cut him out of my life because it's horrible to be around him when he's drunk and he's drunk more often than not. Your family may feel the same about being around you when you are high, so in a way I don't blame them either.\n\nIt's a very difficult situation all around.", "Complicated\n\nDrug addiction sucks and having everyone treat you like you're a loaded gun is awful. I get why people do that, on highs people can be unpredictable. But at the same time they shouldn't be lying on your name then turning around inviting you to things like shit isn't happening.\n\nIt probably would've been better to tell your aunt you couldn't make it but your brother went way too far on his asshole call.", "You should\u2019ve told her you weren\u2019t gonna be there, weddings these days have an absurdly high cost per guest and at the very least they could\u2019ve used the spot for somebody else. However overall NTA and I don\u2019t blame you for not going", "Maybe your family just wants you clean and healthy and they're not asking all these questions to judge you but to (errantly or otherwise) try and keep you on track or show that they're proud of you going to rehab?", "As a widow to addiction, you're so wrong here. I wish that my husband had been \"shipped off\" because he could have been alive to see his children grow up. I tried to help him myself, his whole family did. We did everything we knew to do but we weren't people that were literally trained to help. We dealt with our own denial of how bad it was, believed his excuses. I didn't know how bad it was until the end. I thought it was his drinking that was the problem because that's what I saw, but it was the drugs that killed him. Drugs I didn't even know he was taking or had access to. OPs family did the right thing and OP is still struggling, which you cannot understand the effects of on that family. Drugs get ahold of a person and destroy everything around them while they have them in their grip. \n\nOP, if you see this, I'm not passing judgment on you for this post but I hope beyond hope that you see how Drugs are hurting you and those close to you. I hope that you check yourself in if you're still using. I had to raise my children without a father and the fallout was HUGE for all of us. Don't let the Drugs tell you they're your only way, they aren't. You're going to have to lose the people in your life who help you find Drugs, you'll need to change everything you are to fight them, but I know people who got clean and live good lives. I also know the pain of loss from this and I want you to understand that you are loved, but the Drugs have put up a wall that needs torn down. Please, don't listen to people who say you were tossed away or sent away. Your family just wanted to give you a chance for life and they're so afraid right now. You can get clean. I hope that you do.", "I was thinking something similar. I think the aunt was asking about rehab and addiction because she recognizes that is part of OP's life and maybe she truly wanted to learn more about it. OP, if it made you feel awkward, it's totally fine to tell her that you don't want to talk about it. Often times the people who are willing to address the elephant in the room are doing so because they care and want to give you a chance to talk about it if you want to.", "She went to rehab - yes, reluctantly, it seems - and it sounds like she stayed there long enough to at least get clean, even if she relapsed since and isn't really trying hard now.", "They did want you there, ideally they wanted Sober You there but I know you were not likely to bring that version and even Normal You was gonna get looked at funny and made to feel awkward. \n\nBut they did want to see you, that's why your brother called you.\n\nOne of the disappointing things about addicts is their failure to show up and they are disappointed because yes they love you very much and technically wanted to see (a version of) you.", "I am so sorry for you that your family is so unsupportive. They should be proud of you that you recover and try to get your life back on the wheels instead of judging they should help and embrace you.", "OP, my heart aches for you. Forget about the wedding, you NEED to stop using.\n\nThere\u2019s so much missing in the post, things I understand if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing. About the rehab etc. But just\u2026 no 19 yo has the money to support that kind of drug addiction (for five years!) without stealing or worse. \n\nYou say people judge you and act weird around you. Yes, they act weird because it\u2019s impossible to act normal in an abnormal situation. Watching a loved one self destruct this hard is painful. They can\u2019t just pretend everything is alright with you because it\u2019s not.\n\nA vote in this situation is irrelevant, like commenting on the interior design if the house is on fire. \n\nYou\u2019re in a very dangerous place. I don\u2019t have the answers for you but if it\u2019s an option I think you should try rehab again.", "My experience (briefly) working with people with addiction is some come by it quite honestly. I\u2019ve had multiple people have an injury and were prescribed opioids, became dependent and addicted, and would eventually turn to illegal substances. \nI would say that most of the time trauma is the gateway but sometimes shit just happens. \n\nAll that to be said, I hope that OP invests in themselves no matter how they came into addiction. I don\u2019t wish addiction on anyone."]}
