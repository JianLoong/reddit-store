So i got out of rehab 8 months ago, I\u2019ve been using opioids (mostly oxy and h) since i was 14 and my parents found out and forced me to go to there. I\u2019m not really sober anymore though since like 6 months ago and it\u2019s caused a lot of tension in my family, my parents kicked me out so i\u2019m in between houses with my friends and they\u2019re judging me for that too and it\u2019s just kind of a mess.\n\nThey\u2019re also posting about me on facebook wnd telling my entire family (even people i don\u2019t speak to) about what\u2019s going on with me and telling them not to offer me any money or let me stay at their house because i\u2019m a thief (literally not true). It\u2019s honestly embarrassing for me because i used to be the golden child and they all thought i was gonna do really well at school and all that because i wanted to be a doctor \n\nSo my aunt\u2019s wedding was 2 weeks ago and even though things are bad she told me that i\u2019m still family and she invited me because we used to be kinda close because she\u2019s only 6 years older than me and i used to think of her as a sister. I had plans to go and was even at a family meet up before it a few weeks ago but everybody just looked at me differently. They were all super distant even though i tried to speak with them and it\u2019s like everybody ignored me or judged me\n\nSo i thought okay i won\u2019t go to the wedding it\u2019s too embarrassing anyway if my parents are just gonna be making things up about me. So i didn\u2019t go. And my brother (23m)called me when  he was at the wedding kinda inro the night and started yelling at me over the phone saying he knew i wouldn\u2019t show up and he\u2019s not surprised because i\u2019m a fuck up but i\u2019ve really upset my aunt because she wanted me there. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to msg her since then and she still won\u2019t respond. But the thing is, even in the family meet up i felt like she was judging me and she kept asking me about tons of stuff about rehab like it\u2019s the only thing i\u2019ve ever accomplished in my life. And i could tell her husband thought i was weird too so like fuck it why would i show up if nobody wants me there. But now i feel bad that i\u2019ve upset her but ??????

Until you heal the underlying issues that led you to become addicted, you're probably never going to give it up and will have a very sketchy relationship with your family. Please get into therapy and try to get sober again. Take care of you and then try to work on family relationships.", "NAH.  I don't fault you for feeling uncomfortable in family settings, but I wonder if you have mis-read the emotions of your family.  They are likely just as uncomfortable as you are.  No one knows what to say.  It sounds like your aunt was reaching out and felt hurt that you bailed on the wedding.  Apologize to your aunt, by letter if she won't pick up your calls right now.  Tell your brother the truth about how you feel.  AND STOP USING!", "YTA. you should have told your aunt if you weren't going to go.", "this is one of those cases where I dont think you are the asshole but still think you are in the wrong. So soft YTA. I totally get why you would be embarrased to go, but for your aunt\u2019s sake, I personally think you shouldve put it aside for her since she did want you there. However Ik thats easier said than done and dont blame you for skipping. Good luck with life though, ik it may seem hopeless but it\u2019s not impossible.", "YTA with the specific question about skipping the wedding and this is due to there seemed to be no attempt to let her know prior to this.  You are still in the grips of the addiction which distorts perspective.  I will say this however, the fact that you skipped out on the wedding showed your cousin the exact state that you are in no matter if you intended to do so or not. I believe your action killed any illusion or hope your cousin had that you were recovering or on a good road to recovery.  As you stated, that you saw her like a sister and it would be logical that she saw you in the same light.   \n\n\nYou still have a lot of things to think about if you truly want to recover and be sober.  It's clear since there are a lot of excuses listed in your post (also understandable with someone with an addiction).  To me, all of your family's reactions are not out of the ordinary.  I hope you come to some terms/conclusion and get the help you need. It's a long road.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. Your reaction to your family\u2019s perceived judgment makes sense. Their reaction of shock/surprise also makes sense given the context you provided. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it, OP. Are there any support groups like NA near you that could be a resource? Best of luck!", "YTA you should have gone.  The way you feel is going to naturally put you on a semipermanent defensive.  You need to own what you did (not saying you aren't ) and show everyone you are working damn hard to stay sober.  Good luck.", "Your family are afraid.. so naturally they are gonna watch you when you are all together.. Drugs result in personality changes that can make you feel like you are dealing with an alien body snatcher. It is a state of constant tension for your family members... 'should i mention the drugs?.. the sobriety?... the weather?'. will it be him or not? If i show love will he want to take advantage? Borrow money? Your aunt really tried.. she deserved better", "INFO: Did you try to explain to your aunt beforehand?  Tell her how you want to be there, but can't, because of \\_\\_\\_?", "NAH. You are embarrassed by your choices and don\u2019t want to have to endure the looks and questions that come with I don\u2019t blame you I wouldn\u2019t either. But it seems your aunt was upset that you didn\u2019t attend her wedding and I\u2019m not going to call her an AH for that.", "NTA I\u2019m not going to call you an asshole because it\u2019s clear you were in such a difficult situation, you\u2019re young and the adults who should have your back aren\u2019t helping you.  That said, it wasn\u2019t a wise move and you missed an opportunity. Showing up and behaving like a good guest would have helped quell whatever your parents said about you by showing how completely typical/boring you are vs some criminal mastermind. By not showing up, you fed into the unreliable addict character they tried portraying you as. Your aunt kind of stuck her neck out for you and you stood her up.", "Not sure if this is appropriate. Where's the interpersonal conflict....", "INFO\n\nIs the reason why you got hooked on drugs \u2018cause your blood relatives put a lot of unnecessary and hurtful pressure on you?", "OK, wow.  Recovering addict (alcohol, dried out for a while) here.  First, NAH, but this is really hard.  I feel awful for you.\n\nShame is an important emotion in the addiction journey/mess.  But letting OTHER PEOPLE add weight to the misery many addicts already feel for not being able to get better is a really tough one to read.\n\nYour brother doesn't understand what's going on.  Don't talk to him until you're confident he can be a help to you getting better, not a hindrance.\n\nShe probably did want you there.  But when the time is right - not now, when you're in a better place emotionally and physically - I think the best explanation here is that you were having trouble staying clean and didn't want the problems you were having to be a distraction to her day.  You COULD have handled this better with a proactive apology prior to non-attendance, but this is the next best thing.  That's the best you can do, and I'm so sorry.  This is not a fun road to travel.", "Esh but mostly your parents, then your brother, then you. You're in between houses and got out of rehab. What questions was she supposed to ask?

Addiction is definitely a LOT more complicated than I made it sound. As a recovering one myself, I've learned it's a mine field of all kinds of things. I'm glad you clarified.
