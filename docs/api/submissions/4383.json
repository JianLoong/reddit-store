I decided to take a juice box only and wait for my blood sugars to come up before having some milk.\n\nMy dad came into the living room asking if I suspended my pod and asked what I treated with. I told him I did and that I had juice. He then said \u201cWith what?\u201d. I told him just the juice for now. He started yelling at me (while my two little half sisters were trying to have naps I might add) telling me that I need to treat with sugar AND milk. I told her that the dietitian and my step mother told us that I need to have sugar before I have any protein. \n\nHe started screaming at me that that wasn\u2019t true and that I need to shut my mouth and start listening to him cuz he\u2019s my father.

After telling the endo multiple times about problems with how my ex insists on treating my son, my child finally ended up in DKA while at his dad's. The hospital required that my ex go to a training day for general treatment & one for pump operation. We did those when he was first diagnosed, but dad didn't bother to learn (he's a textbook narcissist). So maybe you should ask your endo & dietitian to schedule a training day for your dad. \n\nHe's wrong - you have to wait until you're trending up before having the protein. Doing it his way slows the absorption of the glucose, then you end up overcorrecting & going high.\n\nAlso have you looked into looping? It's incredible. My son now has the omnipod 5 & dexcom g6, & they talk to each other so it automatically stops the basal if he's going low & gives extra if he's going high.

Your dad is not just TA, he is endangering your health and your life. You should not be living with a man who endangers your health.

You might be safer somewhere you could take care of your medical needs properly.\n\nIf you're in the U.S., your doctor is a mandated child abuse reporter.

Since your dad won't listen to a trained dietician or a nurse (that he is married to), who will he listen to?

I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. You have medical advice on how to treat, and also your nurse step Mom. Why is Dad being so stubborn about the wrong medical treatment? This is not good. Could you ask your step mom to talk to him, do you have your nurses advice in writing? Show this medical advice to him (also maybe from some medical web sites). Try to do this at a calm time. Maybe ask your step Mom to if that would be better. He is likely acting from worry/ love/ thinking he knows what is best for you, but he is wrong and stressing you out and possibly causing you to go against medical advice to appease him, all of which is very bad. He needs to stop. If he won\u2019t, you need to keep yourself safe and follow medical advice. Avoid telling him how you treated, if necessary.", "NTA. Your dad is actively ignoring the advice of healthcare professionals because he thinks he's right on a subject he probably doesn't actually know all that much about.   \nI don't know much about diabetes, but I do know that if what he's telling you to do is not correct for how you need to be treated, it could possibly be very dangerous to your health. It may be a good idea to tell someone, like your doctor, about what he's doing. Especially if he's insisting or forcing you to follow inaccurate medical advice. And I don't normally recommend people lie, but it may be a good idea to tell him you treated yourself \"his way\", both to preserve your health and to avoid him getting angry with you.", "NTA. Ask your doctor to email your treatment recommendations so they're in writing. Print multiple copies and hand one to your dad every time he questions you. Repeat ad nauseum and if he persists make him come to the doctor with you and have it out there.", "Legit two minutes ago he just called me a dumbshit and tried to grab me by my hair when I tried bringing it up to him again", "NTA.   Your father is clueless.", "OP have your SM act as a buffer since he won't believe you or any other medical personnel outside of the family.  If he still doesn't buy it, just act like you're going to go along with it and ignore his recommendations and make him feel good about himself but just don't be honest with him about not following his bad advice.  Your health is more important than his ego.", "NTA. Keep following doctors orders as long as you can get away with it safely. Can you like disguise the juice as milk or something and trick him idk", "Noooooo absolutely NTA at all, in any way whatsoever.\n\nDude is putting his pride over the wellbeing of his own kid, and it's disgusting.

Your doc is right, as I'm sure you're aware. Your dad is your dad, but I don't imagine he's got any education in the field. He has zero business policing your treatment of hypoglycemia if you're following orders from an actual professional. Being the person that I am, I'd just lie about having milk.  \n\nWhat's stepmom's opinion of his behavior? Also, is your dad aware that the suspension option only starts to take effect about 15 minutes in, which is the earliest most of (fast acting) insulin would metabolize? Cause I feel like he's acting high and mighty while knowing jack about diabetes. \n\nP.S. My petty ass would seriously consider a PowerPoint titled \"why you are not qualified to insist that your opinions on my diabetes are more valid than licensed doctors' \", but unfortunately I don't see this improving things.", "NTA his continual insistence that you ignore medical advice given by doctors is abusive. Tell your doctor and teachers that your father wants you to not follow medical advice about controlling your diabetes and when you follow the medical advice he is verbally abusive (because he is). This needs to stop before you land in the hospital.", "NTA. You mentioned you're terrified of him. I take it he's prone to violence on some level. You, stepmom, and little ones need to get out of that situation NOW. Abuse has a pattern, and it always escalates, sometimes to a very tragic conclusion. How many years has he been exhibiting this violent behavior? Did he abuse your mom when they were married, too? While he's at work, see if you can have grandparents pick you up and make sure they are willing to protect you from him. This goes way beyond just forcing you to do something that endangers your health. Tell school about his behavior; have an appointment with guidance counselor during lunch. They're often obligated by law to report to CPS. I know that's the case in U.S. Good luck!", "OP, please call your grandma when it's safe and have her get you out of there. What your dad is doing by doing this amounts to physical abuse. He's trying to force you to take care of yourself wrong. That has physical results. Not to mention the verbal abuse.\n\nYou do understand that staying there with the way he's escalating will cause both physical and emotional harm, right? I wish this wasn't a fast train to adulthood for you but you clearly know you aren't safe there. Please, call your grandma and get to safety.
