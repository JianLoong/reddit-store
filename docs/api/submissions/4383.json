We did those when he was first diagnosed, but dad didn't bother to learn (he's a textbook narcissist). So maybe you should ask your endo & dietitian to schedule a training day for your dad. \n\nHe's wrong - you have to wait until you're trending up before having the protein. Doing it his way slows the absorption of the glucose, then you end up overcorrecting & going high.\n\nAlso have you looked into looping? It's incredible.

Could you ask your step mom to talk to him, do you have your nurses advice in writing? Show this medical advice to him (also maybe from some medical web sites). Try to do this at a calm time. Maybe ask your step Mom to if that would be better.

You, stepmom, and little ones need to get out of that situation NOW. Abuse has a pattern, and it always escalates, sometimes to a very tragic conclusion. How many years has he been exhibiting this violent behavior? Did he abuse your mom when they were married, too? While he's at work, see if you can have grandparents pick you up and make sure they are willing to protect you from him. This goes way beyond just forcing you to do something that endangers your health. Tell school about his behavior; have an appointment with guidance counselor during lunch. They're often obligated by law to report to CPS. I know that's the case in U.S. Good luck!", "OP, please call your grandma when it's safe and have her get you out of there.

Your father is wrong in a way that could literally kill you.", "What is your dad smoking?", "NTA has Dad sat in with you and the dietitians?", "NTA. If he doesn't stop you need to tell your doctors what he is trying to do.", "NTA - my son is T1 and it is common practice, wherever you go for advice that protein slows the absorption of sugars down so treat the low first.  You are doing exactly right and it\u2019s scary he is threatening your life potentially with inaccurate advice and by yelling to hoots!!! \nIs your mum or a grandparent on the scene who can advocate for you?  All I can think of is trying to find medical advice from a nutritional point of view , why high protein diets work and how they slow the absorption to keep you filling fuller and hit him from that way of thinking.  He should see that if it works that way then you obviously need to reverse it for diabetic lows.  Good luck , you sure have a hard enough life without this BS!", "NTA  Your father thinks he knows medicine better than medical professionals just because he's your father?  WTF kind of logic is that?  That and the way he yells at you is overly controlling and borderline abusive.", "Oh and to just add to my point\u2026.. if I was low and drank apple juice then tried to drink milk on top of the juice I would 100% throw up!!!  Then you wouldn\u2019t get the benefit of either!", "> went down to 2.3\n\n\nformer RN. this A1C is hella low. An A1C this low is associated with malnutrition and increased mortality across all causes.\n\nI'm not sure what his brain block is, but he is either not listening to the doctor and your stepmom or not capable of learning the information needed to help you manage your diabetes. Either way, he would do less harm if he did nothing at all to \"help\" you manage your T1D.\n\nDo you have any school counselors you can talk to? I think the only thing that can help here is therapy, for your father and for the damage he's probably done to you. His behavior IS abusive, and you now have stark numbers showing that he is causing you harm.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. You're doing such a great job trying to manage a complex disorder. At 15, that's very mature and you should be proud.\n\nEdit: I'm honestly kinda peeved at that doctor's office. I feel like this is reportable, personally...", "NTA. Wtf? My sister has been a T1D for 18 years and I\u2019ve been volunteering at the juvenile camps for T1D kids since I was 18 because of it and we\u2019ve literally never treated a low with milk??? We keep hella capri suns and the such stocked though. He understands mistreating diabetes comes with a lot of dangerous possibilities, right?", "NTA. Your father\u2019s ego is speaking. If you are not seeing your provider soon (as I a few days), go to your stepmother, the NURSE and explain privately alone what\u2019s occurring. \n\nI guarantee if she\u2019s the good person I think she is, your father will be put on notice real fast. \n\nThere are times when I have lit DH\u2019s ass on fire on his biological children bc he was so wrong. I waited until we were alone, I waited until I\u2019m calm and it was not pretty. \n\nYou need an advocate, you have a professional giving you advice and her advice is being ignored.", "OP NTA of course but you need to call your doctor asap and tell them what your dad is doing and saying. That he is verbally abusing you while giving you deathly bad advice\n\nETA: tell your stepmom what he is doing. She\u2019s a nurse and also T1 so she may be able to help you at home", "NTA--I think you need to ask your father directly why he wants kill you.\n\nBe direct. Also tell him that you don't care what he says about how to treat your condition that you have a doctor and that is who 's advice and direction that you will follow. \n\nAlso tell him if he has a problem with that, he should contact your doctor directly.\n\nFrom now on, it might be best if you treat yourself in private, even if that means you have food in your room or where ever is a safe place for you to treat yourself.\n\nI would also NOT tell him when you have an incident.\n\nIf his verbal abuse still continues, tell him directly that his VERBAL ABUSE won't be tolerated and you will continue to only follow your doctor's instructions.", "NTA. Is your dad aware that milk is basically sugar anyhow? He just wants you to spike your sugar and feel like shit. Your doctor, dietician, and stepmom all want you to bring it up and avoid crashes. Listen to them over him.", "NTA- T1 diabetic myself. I always treat with rapid sugar first and then do a little protein after. If I do milk for a minor low it works but most of the time it takes a while and I feel like garbage. Much rather eat the sugar and then treat milk or whatever as a snack. You\u2019re doing right. Also can I just say I think your dad might need therapy? I\u2019m wondering if because you got it so young, he\u2019s having a tough time letting you make management calls on your own. I was diagnosed at 11 but my parents let me run with it from day 1. Instead of telling me how to treat my lows they let me do my thing and were obviously there to help me if I needed it. Weird too that he won\u2019t take his wife\u2019s advice into consideration as well.", "NTA.  Report this to the clinician.  If necessary, report it to your school.", "Nta. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that. It\u2019s bad enough you have to deal with this pain in ass disease. My son is t1d and I wouldn\u2019t dream of yelling at him for treating . Does your dad go to the endo appointments? If not I would take him and ask that he is educated on how to treat lows.", "NTA.  the dietician should be giving those advice to you in presence of your father, not to you alone. The dietician should also register in the chart that your father refuses to follow the medical advice and forces you to not follow the medical advice.", "NTA. Do what your doctors tell you to do. Normally I don\u2019t advise lying but since your literal life is at stake, until you can get your dad into a training day just do what you know is correct, and pour a bit of milk in a glass and dump it and tell your dad you had milk too so you can avoid this nonsense. Hopefully you can get him in quickly- would be worth calling your doc and mentioning it maybe they can get him into training sooner.", "As a dietitian, i agree with OPs health professionals! Thats standard procedure!\n\nNTA your dad should let you do your thing acording to the professionals. Especially since you are old enough to do that.", "NTA.  But OP, you should tell your health professionals about your father\u2019s behavior.  If you\u2019re not scheduled for another appointment any time soon then you should consider calling child protective services about the situation.  You could also let someone from your school know.", "OP, I'm highlighting this for you:\n\n*His advice will kill you at some point.*\n\n\nPlease understand this. Please, tell the doctors so they can sit him down and drill it into his head. Everytime he insists on milk remind him that he's *telling you to take actions that will harm or kill you*. Say it everytime, even if he yells. This is *medical abuse* from your father.", " You're not stupid. You're smarter than he is since he hasn't figured this out in your entire life.", "This. Your dietitian is a professional. Your dad is not. And he is not a great dad. Tell your dietitian upfront (maybe via e-mail or so) and ask him to the appointment with you. Let her yell at him for putting your life in danger.", "How can she say all that when Dad yells and screams at her the way she describes?  She won't get more than a few words out before he goes off.", "You need to get out. Call CPS or your grandparents and tell them you are scared of being harmed.", "Op I'm so so so sorry. Contact an adult. This is full out abuse and he's putting your life in danger by forcing you to follow his incorrect advice. This is very very bad and you need to let someone know. Contact your doctor, a teacher, CPS, kids help line, just something. I like that your mom is on your side but it sounds like she can't do anything against your father so I think it would be a null point to go to her.", "Call the police", "Your stepmom is a mandated reporter- tell her and then tell her if she doesn\u2019t get him to move out or take you to a safe space you will report both of them to your school. Tell her you don\u2019t want her to lose her nursing license but u are being medically, emotionally, and physically abused by him and it is her job to keep you and your siblings safe", "OP said in a comment her father tried to grab her by the hair while screaming at her and swearing at her, she needs to get out now. It's already physical.", "This! Please tell your dietitian, a counselor, any adult you trust as soon as you can", "Which is insane! Like why tf is it so important to him that she drinks milk?!", "UK have social services. But she needs police ASAP. Op, if you're UK, dial 999 and press 55. The op will know you're in distress & send officers.", "You look your dad in the eye and ask him \u201care you trying to kill me dad?\u201d \u201cDo you want to see me end up in the hospital then you will be satisfied?\u201d", "Don\u2019t know if you should listen to me, but when my mom never backs up I just say the most blunt, harsh reality to shock her because if I explain things well they never click because how could her 20yr old child possibly know more than her? My first thought would be to ask if he would like to see me die because of his advice. And if he doesn\u2019t want me dead to butt out with his deadly medical advice because adults from his generation were raised with the, because I said so crap. My Grammy tried using that as an excuse to why my mom spent 1500 of my money with her mechanic fixing my car behind my back. What a ripoff. Because she can\u2019t know better than her daughter who literally works at an auto parts store and sees mechanics and is actively learning about cars everyday.", "At this point it might be good to call CPS on him. How he is acting can seriously put you in danger.", "So the people who went to school for a solid 8 years+ to study medical treatments are wrong, but your (I assume healthy) father who doesn't have diabetes is telling you to ignore said medical professionals. Ignoring his own life partner? ALL THE WAY NTA. Your pops is going to end up killing you. DO NOT listen to his instructions."]}
