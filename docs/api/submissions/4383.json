The hospital required that my ex go to a training day for general treatment & one for pump operation. We did those when he was first diagnosed, but dad didn't bother to learn (he's a textbook narcissist). So maybe you should ask your endo & dietitian to schedule a training day for your dad. \n\nHe's wrong - you have to wait until you're trending up before having the protein. Doing it his way slows the absorption of the glucose, then you end up overcorrecting & going high.\n\nAlso have you looked into looping? It's incredible. My son now has the omnipod 5 & dexcom g6, & they talk to each other so it automatically stops the basal if he's going low & gives extra if he's going high.

Could you ask your step mom to talk to him, do you have your nurses advice in writing? Show this medical advice to him (also maybe from some medical web sites). Try to do this at a calm time. Maybe ask your step Mom to if that would be better. He is likely acting from worry/ love/ thinking he knows what is best for you, but he is wrong and stressing you out and possibly causing you to go against medical advice to appease him, all of which is very bad.

It may be a good idea to tell someone, like your doctor, about what he's doing. Especially if he's insisting or forcing you to follow inaccurate medical advice.

He has zero business policing your treatment of hypoglycemia if you're following orders from an actual professional. Being the person that I am, I'd just lie about having milk.  \n\nWhat's stepmom's opinion of his behavior? Also, is your dad aware that the suspension option only starts to take effect about 15 minutes in, which is the earliest most of (fast acting) insulin would metabolize? Cause I feel like he's acting high and mighty while knowing jack about diabetes. \n\nP.S. My petty ass would seriously consider a PowerPoint titled \"why you are not qualified to insist that your opinions on my diabetes are more valid than licensed doctors' \", but unfortunately I don't see this improving things.", "NTA his continual insistence that you ignore medical advice given by doctors is abusive. Tell your doctor and teachers that your father wants you to not follow medical advice about controlling your diabetes and when you follow the medical advice he is verbally abusive (because he is). This needs to stop before you land in the hospital.", "NTA. You mentioned you're terrified of him. I take it he's prone to violence on some level. You, stepmom, and little ones need to get out of that situation NOW. Abuse has a pattern, and it always escalates, sometimes to a very tragic conclusion. How many years has he been exhibiting this violent behavior? Did he abuse your mom when they were married, too? While he's at work, see if you can have grandparents pick you up and make sure they are willing to protect you from him. This goes way beyond just forcing you to do something that endangers your health. Tell school about his behavior; have an appointment with guidance counselor during lunch. They're often obligated by law to report to CPS. I know that's the case in U.S. Good luck!", "OP, please call your grandma when it's safe and have her get you out of there. What your dad is doing by doing this amounts to physical abuse. He's trying to force you to take care of yourself wrong. That has physical results. Not to mention the verbal abuse.\n\nYou do understand that staying there with the way he's escalating will cause both physical and emotional harm, right?

Your dad is factually incorrect and this is putting your health at risk. \n\nWhen I was little my dad would always make me drink a huge glass of milk at dinner every night because he wanted me to have strong bones. I would cry and end up with a stomach ache and be running to the bathroom about 20 minutes after dinner. EVERY. NIGHT. Turns out I was lactose intolerant. As soon as he found that out he stopped forcing the milk and asked me to take calcium supplements instead. I would bet your dad cares about you and genuinely wants what is best for you although he doesn't actually know what that is.\n\n\nHe needs to be educated. Would he be able to attend an appointment with you and your dietitian? He needs to learn why having protein when experiencing a low blood sugar will interfere with absorption of glucose and slow this process down. Maybe hearing that from your medical professionals is what it will take to change his mind, even if it is unpalatable sometimes that's what it takes.\n\nIn the meantime, take care of yourself and do what you know is right for your body.", "NTA- Your dad is incorrect and the trained professionals are right.  I have 2 T1D sons by the way, so I'm familiar with all this stuff.  \n\nCan you talk to your stepmom about the issue with your dad? Maybe she could sit down and have a talk with him.  Does he go to your Endo appts with you, if so you could talk to your doctor and have him explain it to your dad.   Either way, you need to get a trusted adult involved because his advice could be dangerous.  \n\nI'm so sorry you are having to deal with his behavior.  You have enough to deal with as it is.", "OMG.  NTA I  am a reactive hypoglycemic.  When mine drops it drops fast and can get into the 20s.  The most important thing is to get it up as fast as possible first.  I take a few glucotabs and sometimes have to take as many as 6 before it starts to rise.  Once it hits 70 I eat protein to help keep it steady.  My doctor told me up first and then protein to keep it steady.\n\nYour dad is so wrong.  He is basically forcing you to lie to him to save your own life.  Next time.  Take the sugar and then put some milk in a glass and pour it out and put the glass in the sink.  Lie your ass off and tell him you had both.

Your health is more important.", "Ok so I feel like I have some insight here. I\u2019m a mother, my sons about to be 20 years old and has been T1D since 13 months old. \n\nI know the fear that gets permanently installed into a parent with a child who has this disease, diagnosed at such a young age. At one point the juice/milk thing was probably the only thing that worked to keep you stable after a low. BUT he needs to be able to update those findings as you grow and your body changes. Things will always been fluctuating throughout your life. What works for your sugars now, might not work later. \n\nNo matter who it is, never let someone else dictate your health to you. Maybe explain that the juice and milk combo isn\u2019t stabilizing you like it did before, and you\u2019re going to try it this way for a little bit to see the outcomes. I hope you\u2019ve got a CGM to be able to closely monitor your sugars for any trial and error that you do. But if you don\u2019t, definitely test more often. Personally, I have found that suspending the pump and treating will jump my sons sugar back up quickly, but then the amount of time without insulin will come back to bite in a few hours. It\u2019s just a matter of finding what works for your diabetes and not someone else\u2019s. Everyone is different.\n\nEdit: After reading some of the other comments and your replies to them. Get out of there. I have never and will never yell at my son regarding his diabetes. It\u2019s not a way to solve a problem. Even when he ended up in the hospital twice this year while away at college, I never yelled at him. I waited until his sugars were stable and then we talked about what I might have done in that situation instead. Emotions play a lot into controlling your sugars, not feeling safe (scared/stress) can easily put them out of whack. You need to be in a different home.", "\"No father would tell their children to do something that can kill them, you're just an asshole who thinks he knows better than medical professionals. Grow up.\" is what you *should* say, but everyone who's had ballistic parents like your dad knows how well that will turn out.

Mom of T1D here. Do what works for your blood sugars, no matter who tells it to you.", "NTA , when treating low blood sugar you need a quick burst of energy.

No one who knows you, is close to you, and is a mandated reporter is doing ANYTHING to protect you.
