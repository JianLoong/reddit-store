He also loves to tell you that he told you so if you dare to do something differently to his suggestion and it goes the wrong way. My brother's wife, Cindy (F29), is honestly an angel of a person, and her patience is never ending. I genuinely believe that their marriage is held together by her patience, because I would have had it with my brother a long time ago. They were married five years ago, and Cindy gave birth to a beautiful baby boy a month ago. \n\nDuring the pregnancy, whenever I would ask about names, Cindy always said that they had not been able to agree on anything yet. During these conversations, my brother would say, \"Well, we all know what I think we should name the baby, and it is up to Cindy to come up with something better if she doesn't like it.\" Cindy would always laugh when my brother said this and would say something about finding something they both agreed on, but it certainly seemed like my brother had made up his mind. For reference, the name my brother was adamant about was Joseph, which Cindy really disliked.\n\nBy the time Cindy went into labour, her and my brother had a short list of three names which Cindy said they would choose from once they had met the baby and seen his face. Joseph was not on the list. Unfortunately, there were some complications during the birth and Cindy had to be rushed to emergency surgery while my brother dealt with all the paperwork. I am sure you can see where this is going - he put Joseph on the birth certificate while Cindy was unconscious.\n\nIt seems that this was the straw that broke the camel's back, and Cindy has filed for divorce. My brother is suddenly crying to the world and their dog that his wife's pregnancy and post-partum hormones have gotten the better of her, and she is throwing away their lives over a temper tantrum. He also said that she would come to realise Joseph is a good/strong name. I admit, it was probably not my finest moment, but I have been telling my brother for years that Cindy's patience would come to an end, and so I said that I had told him so.\n\nI also told him that I will do anything and everything I can to support Cindy through this, and that if he is looking for someone to blame, it is 100% on him and his \"my way or the highway\" personality. I said that no reasonable or kind person would have used their wife being unconscious as an opportunity to get their own way.\n\nNow my family are telling me I used this as an opportunity to be vindictive rather than supportive, and I can't possibly understand what divorce is like. My mom (F58) told me that I have clearly been holding a grudge against my brother and couldn't wait to rub his face in something.

A horrid self centred bully who takes total advantage of his wife's serious medical situation to get one over on her In respect of the child she just gave birth to. No wonder she\u2019s had enough.

So no, no mercy, he has to learn. If Cindy is as good a woman as OP said he better honestly learn and change to try to get her back.\nMaybe there is no way she forgives him and she would be right in doing that, but he has to do something to change how much of a jerk he is and this is the perfect motivation and opportunity to do it. So I would say that you should advise him on that and the mom too, that he has to change if he wants to solve this situation or she is gonna lose her grandson and it will be her son\u2019s fault.\nOP should also try to make sure to support Cindy and try to help he nephew if she can imo, but that is another topic.", "NTA\n\n1000% NTA\n\nYour brother really crossed a line. An original birth certificate can only be appended not changed. Even if he honestly thought she would be alright with it, if he nelieved that to his very core, filling that out while she was unconscious in the hospital was an absolutely horrendous move. He took that from her and now, for the rest of her son's life, even if he changes his name, there will be a piece of paperwork that he needs that will always remind her of how selfish and callous he is.\n\nYou are entirely in the right to support Cindy and your mom ought to be ashamed. That woman just gave birth to her grandson and before she even woke up and held the baby her son disrespected her, like her voice and opinions were meaningless.

For the past 25 years I have reviewed medical records for different jobs. Labor is still a serious event for any woman, modern medicine has made it much safer but it is still a risky time for the mom and baby.  I think Cindy woke up, found out what happened and realized her hubby didn't care if she died. Only cared about getting his way. My ex husband (ex for a reason obviously) even him, I know in that situation would have picked the name I like most. In case I didn't make it. So he could do \"one last thing\" for me and a way for him and child to remember the mom who lost her life bringing that child in the world.\n\nIt is not about the name.

It seems like both Cindy and your brother are a bit TA, both for being so hung up over a name and your brother for pulling the stunt he did while Cindy was recuperating from surgery.  But I don't think either of these actions rise to the level of divorce.", "I don't know if these people are in the states, but when I had my baby a year ago the nurses made sure my husband and I both looked over the name.
