And then there's my brother, Nate(25m) and my parents(Both 55). Well recently was Nate's wedding (it was Friday). I was supposed to be a groomsmen but I didn't go and stayed at home with my wife. Here's why. \n\nDuring wedding planning, my precious Lottie found out she was pregnant with our first baby! Of course we were over the moon but kept it on the downlow to not take attention from Nate and his Wife. Well A few weeks ago our precious little girl was born, and though she's a little doll, we suspect she has colic. She's been crying nonstop. I was still going to go to the wedding but when the day came Lottie was very stressed and couldn't get our little girl to sleep or do anything really, she wouldn't sleep, eat, or stop crying until her little face was red. Lottie was exhausted, you could tell. So I decided to stay and try to take care of my daughter while I tried to let Lottie sleep. I called Nate to let him know that I just couldn't make it and he flipped out at me, yelling, screaming, calling me every name under the sun, therefore I hung up.\n\nWell a few minutes after that my parents were blowing up my phone calling me an ass for bailing. When I tried explaining why, my mother told me \"Who cares *my name*?! It's the wife's job to take care of the kids not the men!\" (Which is not true at all.) After I still wouldn't budge my parents told my family leading to some family members to blow up my phone some more. When Lottie found out she was apologizing over and over but I don't think my Lottie should feel bad for needing a break. So reddit AITA? (I blocked the family members who were scolding me, and went LC with my brother and parents until things die down.)", "created_utc": 1698632041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jizsh/aita_for_choosing_my_wife_over_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bailing last minute on the day of the wedding was really rude.

You were supposed to be a groomsman, you don\u2019t just bail on your brother the night of. That\u2019s awful. I understand you want to support your wife and baby but to hang your brother out to dry is pretty unforgivable. \n\nI\u2019m feeling like this is fake though bc of the writing. \u201cMy precious Lottie\u201d and that insane comment by your parents. Also your choice was so egregious it feels like rage bait.", "Newborns with colic are no dream, but man... You could have at least gone to the ceremony and pictures. Your sweet Lottie could have handled a couple of hours. \n\nESH - You could have let your sweet Lottie sleep up until the wedding, then she could have taken over for a couple hours.

I am all for you supporting your wife.  That is great.  And if you were merely a guest at the wedding I would have no problem with you skipping.  But you were actually in the wedding party.  You waited until the day of the wedding and bailed on your brother.  He had no time to make any adjustments.  That was absolutely wrong and rude on your part.  Colic is a difficult thing to deal with in an infant.  However many, many babies have colic and parents learn how to deal with it.  It is an expected part of parenting.\n\nI get you didn\u2019t want your wife to be alone.  She could have coped, I am sure but it is much easier if there are 2 adults.  Does she not have any friends or family nearby that could have come over for a couple of hours?  Unless your daughter was born prematurely and unexpectedly, you had plenty of time to arrange for someone to help her while you kept a rather serious commitment to your brother that I assume you made in good faith.  You probably could have skipped the reception, just going to the ceremony and pictures and would not have been gone that long.", "You are going to get two different responses here: One from every family that has been touched with a problematic infant who is either colicky or otherwise unwell, And the other from people who have put a lot of eggs into the basket of planning a wedding instead of a marriage.  \nTruth is probably somewhere in the middle. You should have made every effort to at least be there for the ceremony even if you had to ditch the reception for family duty.\nHowever your parents at minimum should have been more understanding.\n\nAll you can do now is move forward and see what family should be salvaged.", "YTA\n\nso if I read this right, you found out during the wedding planning your wife was pregant and depending on what stage that was at there was still what...8-10 months till the wedding date it sounds like? \n\nso you knew MONTHS beforehand and so had MONTHS to plan out being a groomsman for your brother.

You had multiple days to find someone to help your wife on that day but you chose not to. You owe your brother an apology because you where a shit brother. Just because your married and a father doesn't mean your other family disappears. Doesn't mean that things you agree to don't need you to follow through. You know how much time and effort a wedding takes you ruined it by being selfish. The baby was in no real danger I understand your wife was stressed you could have at least made it to the ceremony and told your brother you needed to leave after because your wife needed you but you chose to bail on him and a responsibility you agreed too. \n\nYTA you owe your brother and family an apology. You also made your wife look like someone who made you stay away from your family which isn't great.

Have you taken her to the doctor? Have you tried colic drops? Depending on how baby is fed: have you tried changing formula or your wife eliminating foods known to make babies gassy?\n\nIt could be colic, it could be something else like a good intolerance, GERD, or possibly something worse. Her refusing to eat and not calming at all are both signs you need to at least call her doctor. Get her seen if only to ensure there\u2019s not something else going on.", "YTA. I had a colicky baby. Like the doctor said it was the extreme end of how long the baby was colicky. I was so sleep-deprived, I started having \u201cvisions\u201d of angels. Yeah.\n\nBut I would never let my husband phone in an excuse to being in his brother\u2019s wedding over a few hours of misery that I\u2019m already experiencing. OMG. I didn\u2019t really sleep for months. I was losing my sh*t. But this is effing ridiculous on a global scale. Show up, do the wedding, stay a little while to the reception, but then go home. \n\nOP, you blew up so much with your family and you didn\u2019t have to.

YTA", "Unless you took your baby to the doctor that day because there was something unusual about the colic that made it seem like an emergency, I would say unfortunately, YTA. You could have planned for some support for your wife so that you'd be able to go to the wedding. Mother's helper, her sister to come in town, for you to take Thursday off of work so she could get some sleep in advance of you being busy on Friday, there are a lot of things you could have done. Instead you just bailed on your brother. I don't know, I think it's pretty shabby to do that.\n\nAnd, yes, I had a baby with colic. 24/7 screaming for about 8-10 weeks. He used to cry in his sleep so it was never quiet. My husband went on weeklong work trips while I looked after the colicky baby. No question, it's awful. But when you have something you have to do, you find a way to do it. The fact that neither you nor your wife found a way to make this happen, says that you just didn't think your brother's wedding was very important.", "YTA and your wife is TA for not demanding that you honor your commitment to your brother.", "NTA.

If your brother ever becomes a parent I\u2019m sure (or hope) he\u2019ll see that what you did was the right thing to do.

You should have mentioned something sooner to your brother and family instead of the day of the wedding since you were in the wedding party and now you allowed your wife to become the fallback victim to blame within your family. Unless the baby just developed colic the night before or the day of the wedding why did you sit on your ass and not communicate. There is a reason why your wife doesn't want you to fully cut contact with your family. She will be the one to blame for everything when it's your communication issues all along.

It put my partner in the very awkward situation of managing obligations to two competing families- one being myself and our baby, the other being his family of origin. I really feel for him in hindsight because often the obligations were contradictory, and whatever he did with good intentions, someone would blame him for not being there.\nIn OP\u2019s case, I can\u2019t really say whose \u201cfault\u201d this dynamic is because I don\u2019t know the history of this dynamic, but it seems to me that this is simply a sucky situation that occurs when a wife is not really integrated into/ accepted by the husband\u2019s extended family, or vice versa.", "Ffs he was a grooms man not the best man so what if it was last minute \ud83e\udd37 newborn child takes precedence over a damn wedding  NTA thank u for being a decent man an putting Ur wife 1st....its obvious from this thread far to many would have left the new mother to sink  and yet society wonders why ppd is so prevalent", "NTA\u2014reluctantly.

And then there's my brother, Nate(25m) and my parents(Both 55). Well recently was Nate's wedding (it was Friday). I was supposed to be a groomsmen but I didn't go and stayed at home with my wife. Here's why. \n\nDuring wedding planning, my precious Lottie found out she was pregnant with our first baby! Of course we were over the moon but kept it on the downlow to not take attention from Nate and his Wife. Well A few weeks ago our precious little girl was born, and though she's a little doll, we suspect she has colic. She's been crying nonstop. I was still going to go to the wedding but when the day came Lottie was very stressed and couldn't get our little girl to sleep or do anything really, she wouldn't sleep, eat, or stop crying until her little face was red. Lottie was exhausted, you could tell. So I decided to stay and try to take care of my daughter while I tried to let Lottie sleep. I called Nate to let him know that I just couldn't make it and he flipped out at me, yelling, screaming, calling me every name under the sun, therefore I hung up.\n\nWell a few minutes after that my parents were blowing up my phone calling me an ass for bailing. When I tried explaining why, my mother told me \"Who cares *my name*?! It's the wife's job to take care of the kids not the men!\" (Which is not true at all.) After I still wouldn't budge my parents told my family leading to some family members to blow up my phone some more. When Lottie found out she was apologizing over and over but I don't think my Lottie should feel bad for needing a break. So reddit AITA?

When you know you have a day like this coming, you plan ahead.", "Did the mom make the comment at all. OP doesn't come across as honest. If he was his title would be, \"AITA for letting my brother down in the last possible moment for his wedding, for a problem I could have anticipated in advance and found a solution too\".\n\nOP needs a little violin.", "Yup.  Fake.  99.9999% sure.", "That was off to me as well \u201cprecious \u201c was particularly jarring", "It feels like bait written to explore the extreme end of \"prioritize your chosen family over your family of origin\"", "He\u2019s not \u201csupporting his wife,\u201d he\u2019s being a parent. Everyone is ignoring that the baby is *a few weeks old.*\nHe should have said it wasn\u2019t going to happen sooner, but no one should be expecting him to come in the first place", "Meh I get what you\u2019re saying.  I was a groomsman to both of my brother-in-law\u2019s didn\u2019t want to be there and that was 10+ years ago still have no contact with them not there was anything bad that happened. I wish I had an excuse like a sick baby to escape their wedding.", "It has all the stereotypical elements, including the part where his phone \u201cblew up\u201d with angry messages.", "Not really, most of her family live far away the closest family member is her sister and she lives 2 hours away though she comes to visit every weekend since the baby was born", "He\u2019s actually getting three different responses because his post is fake. But I guess he needs the attention\u2026", "Colic is CONSTANT crying. Literally.", "If you don\u2019t know what colic is, then you don\u2019t know what a hellscape it is.  And you can\u2019t plan for it, because not all babies have it.  Colic can send mothers into full PPD spirals.  It\u2019s horrific.  Imagine a baby who cries nonstop from about 6PM until 3AM.  No matter what you do.  That\u2019s what colic is.", "Yeah, I call shenanigans.", "Troll of some sort", "What?", "He actually is supporting his wife as well, being the good parent *and* a good husband!", "I want to go NC but Lottie didn't want to be the reason I stopped talking to my family so rn we're going Low contact.", "My youngest had colic. I would never, ever expect my husband to miss his brother's wedding because of it! That would be incredibly selfish and wrong. There's not much you can do with colic, which means wife didn't NEED him there, it's not like baby was truly sick or in the hospital.  His brother, on the other hand, had the right to expect him there.", "Likely they did considering his parents have multiple children.", "And how is he the ah for taking care of his family?", "This. All of it.", "He is the AH here though, he\u2019s had months to plan arrangements to help with the newborn to support his brother for one night, instead he bailed the day of the wedding. It probably threw the whole wedding party off if he was walking with someone or had to say a speech etc.", "There is absolutely 100% zero reason he didn\u2019t plan ahead. A few weeks old means he had plenty of time to get his wife some help so he could support his brother OR withdraw from being a groomsman. Having a baby doesn\u2019t give you a get out of jail free card for being an asshole.", "The baby isn't dying, or even sick per se. It's an incredibly common, perfectly survivable event. A wedding is a once in a lifetime event (mostly). It's also only a few hours. He could have gotten someone to stay with dear, precious, beautiful Lottie. Or she could have held it down for a few hours. This will happen again. If it's even real.", "So she comes to visit every weekend and couldn't come in order to allow you to attend a wedding you were in?

At the bare minimum you had a few weeks to arrange for someone to come help OR a few weeks to drop out of the wedding. Day of is an AH move when there isn't an emergency.", "And you had multiple days to ask one of them to come help her on that day but you didn't you failed.", "is this something thats .... diagnosed or a term that is just used when parents decide its suitable?  \n\nEither way it still reads like OP has had weeks to 'plan' for something to be in place but opted not to even think about it", "But he didn\u2019t find out baby had colic the day of the wedding.", "You just a huge dick because you chose to be a huge AH your child gets to not have a relationship with your family you need therapy because you are in the wrong here get your head out you ass man. Your family is right you where wrong.", "Who blows off a once in a lifetime event for their brother because their baby was crying? That's ridiculous. You don't abandon your brother at the altar because of colic. The fact your family was upset is because it was so important to them that you show up. Good lord. And your response is not regret at abandoning them but to cut them off? Insanity.", "Lol at you thinking you're the one initiating the loss of contact.", "I hope you stand up to your family. This is not your wife\u2019s fault or problem.", "please help her understand that she is *not* the reason. *their* behavior, *their* choices, are the reasons. *they* acted like ripe assholes, and so *they* deserve to be crushed under your boundaries.", "Honestly I would be more understanding if he was just a guest but he was a groomsman and put his brother in a hard place cancelling at last minute.If he knew that his kid had colic he should have never agreed to be in the wedding in the first place.", "I\u2019m a firm believer that two adults are needed for a colicky baby - to spell each other once the Witching Nine or Ten Hours starts.\n\nExtra-stressed mother (as OP says Lottie was) + colicky baby can (and has) end with a shaken baby.  I will say that OP & Lottie probably should have had help lined up for Lottie well in advance of the wedding, but that\u2019s me looking back on the time my husband left me for 16 hours alone with my 12-day-old colicky baby and my 2.5 year old, not anything a first time parent would think they might need.", "Not necessarily!  I learned that when I had my own colicky baby.", "Have you ever had a screaming crying unhappy colicky baby and no sleep on top of being a new parent? \n\n They are allowed to be upset he did not attend but a baby takes precedence. \nI was a bridesmaid 10 days after my baby was born.  The day after he projectile vomited... . and eventually was in hospital. Had that happened on the wedding day, stuff them I would have been with my baby. They would have understood being the right sort of caring friends.", "No, parents don\u2019t just decide their baby cries a lot = colicky.  It\u2019s not just a \u201cterm\u201d parents say when it\u2019s suitable. There\u2019s no test\u2026 so how would they diagnose? \n\nIt\u2019s literally non stop, loud crying that you can\u2019t stop. Like scream cry.", "He didn\u2019t say that anywhere in the post.  He says he was still going to the wedding until the day, and that\u2019s because his wife was extra stressed.\n\nExtra-stressed, exhausted mom + colicky baby can (and has) end up with a baby getting shaken.  (I never shook mine, but I distinctly remember a moment where I thought \u201cI never understood how a parent could shake a baby, but I get it now.\u201d  And then I went outside and sat on my front steps for a few minutes while my baby cried safe in his crib.) OP put his child\u2019s well-being over his brother\u2019s wedding.  That was the right thing to do.\n\nI will say that upon thinking it over more, they probably should have arranged for help to be at home with Lottie way before the baby was even born.  But that\u2019s how an experienced parent thinks, not a brand-new first time parent, so OP and Lottie can be forgiven for not knowing that.", "I agree that she is not the reason. But you're wrong that they are the reason. The reason is entirely OP.", "Op is the reason not them or her he's a grade AH", "Yes I have. I had a colicky baby. Life still had to move on (and I was the sleepless mom, with three older kids). My husband was military at the time and I had had a c-section. He made arrangements. \n\nThat doesn't negate anything I said. This was not an emergency. The baby didn't develop colic an hour before the wedding. The baby didn't stop sleeping and start crying an hour before the wedding. OP had at least a couple of weeks to make arrangements or drop out of the wedding. He CHOSE to do it day of. His lack of planning is on him and no one else. \n\nHe also had the entirety of the wedding planning to say \"Hey, we are going to have a newborn. I don't know if being in the wedding is a great idea.\"", "Correct answer. I had a colicky baby, my mum had a colicky baby. You love your baby, but those colicky babies drive you to the brink until you can work out what soothes them. This can take weeks to months. Took 5 months for us.

The withdrawal isn\u2019t the issue, it\u2019s the timing when the situation was foreseeable. Having a new baby is enough to withdraw even without the colick", " True and Fair enough.  I did reread the post after your comment and he does seem a bit sappy.", "Exactly this.\n\nThe OP's parents were out of line with what they said.  They may be saying goodbye to a relationship with their grandchildren.\n\nThe brother probably should've chosen someone else to be his best man... doesn't sound like they are that close if the OP didn't have any sort of contingency plan for this wedding.\n\nESH", "Obviously.\n\nBut you\u2019re the asshole for dismissing colicky. OP is the asshole for last minute ditching when it\u2019s been an issue for a while.", "Yeah. I get being super into a new baby (I was, four times over) but I never hit that level of sappy lol.", "ok?...\n\ni never dismissed it rather just cast an objective assessment of the lack of planning on OPs side.", "I'm now of the side that he is a bit of a wussy babe and should have manned up"]}
