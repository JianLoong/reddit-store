And then there's my brother, Nate(25m) and my parents(Both 55). Well recently was Nate's wedding (it was Friday). I was supposed to be a groomsmen but I didn't go and stayed at home with my wife. Here's why. \n\nDuring wedding planning, my precious Lottie found out she was pregnant with our first baby! Of course we were over the moon but kept it on the downlow to not take attention from Nate and his Wife. Well A few weeks ago our precious little girl was born, and though she's a little doll, we suspect she has colic. She's been crying nonstop. I was still going to go to the wedding but when the day came Lottie was very stressed and couldn't get our little girl to sleep or do anything really, she wouldn't sleep, eat, or stop crying until her little face was red. Lottie was exhausted, you could tell. So I decided to stay and try to take care of my daughter while I tried to let Lottie sleep. I called Nate to let him know that I just couldn't make it and he flipped out at me, yelling, screaming, calling me every name under the sun, therefore I hung up.\n\nWell a few minutes after that my parents were blowing up my phone calling me an ass for bailing. When I tried explaining why, my mother told me \"Who cares *my name*?! It's the wife's job to take care of the kids not the men!\" (Which is not true at all.) After I still wouldn't budge my parents told my family leading to some family members to blow up my phone some more. When Lottie found out she was apologizing over and over but I don't think my Lottie should feel bad for needing a break. So reddit AITA? (I blocked the family members who were scolding me, and went LC with my brother and parents until things die down.)", "created_utc": 1698632041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jizsh/aita_for_choosing_my_wife_over_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 1174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bailing last minute on the day of the wedding was really rude.

You were supposed to be a groomsman, you don\u2019t just bail on your brother the night of. That\u2019s awful. I understand you want to support your wife and baby but to hang your brother out to dry is pretty unforgivable. \n\nI\u2019m feeling like this is fake though bc of the writing. \u201cMy precious Lottie\u201d and that insane comment by your parents. Also your choice was so egregious it feels like rage bait.", "Newborns with colic are no dream, but man... You could have at least gone to the ceremony and pictures. Your sweet Lottie could have handled a couple of hours. \n\nESH - You could have let your sweet Lottie sleep up until the wedding, then she could have taken over for a couple hours.

I am all for you supporting your wife.  That is great.  And if you were merely a guest at the wedding I would have no problem with you skipping.  But you were actually in the wedding party.  You waited until the day of the wedding and bailed on your brother.  He had no time to make any adjustments.  That was absolutely wrong and rude on your part.  Colic is a difficult thing to deal with in an infant.  However many, many babies have colic and parents learn how to deal with it.  It is an expected part of parenting.\n\nI get you didn\u2019t want your wife to be alone.  She could have coped, I am sure but it is much easier if there are 2 adults.  Does she not have any friends or family nearby that could have come over for a couple of hours?  Unless your daughter was born prematurely and unexpectedly, you had plenty of time to arrange for someone to help her while you kept a rather serious commitment to your brother that I assume you made in good faith.  You probably could have skipped the reception, just going to the ceremony and pictures and would not have been gone that long.", "You are going to get two different responses here: One from every family that has been touched with a problematic infant who is either colicky or otherwise unwell, And the other from people who have put a lot of eggs into the basket of planning a wedding instead of a marriage.  \nTruth is probably somewhere in the middle. You should have made every effort to at least be there for the ceremony even if you had to ditch the reception for family duty.\nHowever your parents at minimum should have been more understanding.\n\nAll you can do now is move forward and see what family should be salvaged.", "YTA\n\nso if I read this right, you found out during the wedding planning your wife was pregant and depending on what stage that was at there was still what...8-10 months till the wedding date it sounds like? \n\nso you knew MONTHS beforehand and so had MONTHS to plan out being a groomsman for your brother.

You had multiple days to find someone to help your wife on that day but you chose not to. You owe your brother an apology because you where a shit brother. Just because your married and a father doesn't mean your other family disappears. Doesn't mean that things you agree to don't need you to follow through. You know how much time and effort a wedding takes you ruined it by being selfish. The baby was in no real danger I understand your wife was stressed you could have at least made it to the ceremony and told your brother you needed to leave after because your wife needed you but you chose to bail on him and a responsibility you agreed too. \n\nYTA you owe your brother and family an apology. You also made your wife look like someone who made you stay away from your family which isn't great.

Have you taken her to the doctor? Have you tried colic drops? Depending on how baby is fed: have you tried changing formula or your wife eliminating foods known to make babies gassy?\n\nIt could be colic, it could be something else like a good intolerance, GERD, or possibly something worse. Her refusing to eat and not calming at all are both signs you need to at least call her doctor. Get her seen if only to ensure there\u2019s not something else going on.", "YTA. I had a colicky baby. Like the doctor said it was the extreme end of how long the baby was colicky. I was so sleep-deprived, I started having \u201cvisions\u201d of angels. Yeah.\n\nBut I would never let my husband phone in an excuse to being in his brother\u2019s wedding over a few hours of misery that I\u2019m already experiencing. OMG. I didn\u2019t really sleep for months. I was losing my sh*t. But this is effing ridiculous on a global scale. Show up, do the wedding, stay a little while to the reception, but then go home. \n\nOP, you blew up so much with your family and you didn\u2019t have to.

YTA", "Unless you took your baby to the doctor that day because there was something unusual about the colic that made it seem like an emergency, I would say unfortunately, YTA. You could have planned for some support for your wife so that you'd be able to go to the wedding. Mother's helper, her sister to come in town, for you to take Thursday off of work so she could get some sleep in advance of you being busy on Friday, there are a lot of things you could have done. Instead you just bailed on your brother. I don't know, I think it's pretty shabby to do that.\n\nAnd, yes, I had a baby with colic. 24/7 screaming for about 8-10 weeks. He used to cry in his sleep so it was never quiet. My husband went on weeklong work trips while I looked after the colicky baby. No question, it's awful. But when you have something you have to do, you find a way to do it. The fact that neither you nor your wife found a way to make this happen, says that you just didn't think your brother's wedding was very important.", "YTA and your wife is TA for not demanding that you honor your commitment to your brother.", "NTA.

If your brother ever becomes a parent I\u2019m sure (or hope) he\u2019ll see that what you did was the right thing to do.

You should have mentioned something sooner to your brother and family instead of the day of the wedding since you were in the wedding party and now you allowed your wife to become the fallback victim to blame within your family. Unless the baby just developed colic the night before or the day of the wedding why did you sit on your ass and not communicate. There is a reason why your wife doesn't want you to fully cut contact with your family. She will be the one to blame for everything when it's your communication issues all along.

You have a newborn who is having difficulties, and you hope it's colic, but you don't really know yet.

It put my partner in the very awkward situation of managing obligations to two competing families- one being myself and our baby, the other being his family of origin. I really feel for him in hindsight because often the obligations were contradictory, and whatever he did with good intentions, someone would blame him for not being there.\nIn OP\u2019s case, I can\u2019t really say whose \u201cfault\u201d this dynamic is because I don\u2019t know the history of this dynamic, but it seems to me that this is simply a sucky situation that occurs when a wife is not really integrated into/ accepted by the husband\u2019s extended family, or vice versa.", "Ffs he was a grooms man not the best man so what if it was last minute \ud83e\udd37 newborn child takes precedence over a damn wedding  NTA thank u for being a decent man an putting Ur wife 1st....its obvious from this thread far to many would have left the new mother to sink  and yet society wonders why ppd is so prevalent", "NTA\u2014reluctantly.

And then there's my brother, Nate(25m) and my parents(Both 55). Well recently was Nate's wedding (it was Friday). I was supposed to be a groomsmen but I didn't go and stayed at home with my wife. Here's why. \n\nDuring wedding planning, my precious Lottie found out she was pregnant with our first baby! Of course we were over the moon but kept it on the downlow to not take attention from Nate and his Wife. Well A few weeks ago our precious little girl was born, and though she's a little doll, we suspect she has colic. She's been crying nonstop. I was still going to go to the wedding but when the day came Lottie was very stressed and couldn't get our little girl to sleep or do anything really, she wouldn't sleep, eat, or stop crying until her little face was red. Lottie was exhausted, you could tell. So I decided to stay and try to take care of my daughter while I tried to let Lottie sleep. I called Nate to let him know that I just couldn't make it and he flipped out at me, yelling, screaming, calling me every name under the sun, therefore I hung up.\n\nWell a few minutes after that my parents were blowing up my phone calling me an ass for bailing. When I tried explaining why, my mother told me \"Who cares *my name*?! It's the wife's job to take care of the kids not the men!\" (Which is not true at all.) After I still wouldn't budge my parents told my family leading to some family members to blow up my phone some more. When Lottie found out she was apologizing over and over but I don't think my Lottie should feel bad for needing a break. So reddit AITA?

I really hope this is okay for you and please let me know if there is anything I can do before the ceremony to help you out. \u201c\n\nAnd that\u2019s if he really needs to go back asap.", "Take issue all you want. You\u2019re wrong. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Please don\u2019t think his dear daring Lottie is fake, that is his beautiful wife.  \ud83e\uddd0", "exactly! it's great that he wants to take care of his kid! but he missed out on a once in a lifetime milestone event for his family.  that's really messed up.", "He can play Mr. husband/father of the year for the REST of his life. The bro only has ONE day to make this work, and no back up. \n\nHe KNEW about this day AGES ago. Let\u2019s not use colicky babies and new mother as an excuse please. \n\nAgain, saying this as a mother of 2 EXTREME colicky babies. I had to bundle up myself and baby to go for a 3 AM walk in the SNOW to calm him down a bit. I FULLY understand how miserable colicky babies are. And I\u2019m still saying OP is huge YTA!!!!", "How exactly would he plan for that? He didn\u2019t plan for his child to be sick, and as a father he has a duty to help his family in times of need.", "I'd suggest going mild to medium contact.  But don't go spicy contact yet you're not ready.", "It sounds like you\u2019d be doing your family a favor by going LC/NC and not the other way around.\n\nYou\u2019re a fucking awful brother man. What a shitty reason to skip out of the wedding at the VERY LAST MINUTE. I\u2019m surprised you actually called to say you couldn\u2019t make it instead of just texting your brother. You sound like the type of person who would ask for divorce via text", "This was my first reaction when he called her \"my precious Lottie.\"  Like wtf dude?  My husband better never...", "I'm thinking they're getting writing tips from those Nigerian romance scammer scripts. At least they got the spelling correct for the most part.", "AI", "Yeah, the repetitiveness of \u201cmy previous wife Lottie\u201d threw me off. If he\u2019s so in love with his wife and child, that\u2019s great and cute, but the wording of this post is just off.", "Yeah, I think so, too.", "So OP should told his brother when wife were pregnant or after the baby was born that here could no longer be groomsman. Yet he waited until the day of the wedding to say something", "Yes, how do you keep the existence of a baby on the DL? What does that even mean? Precious Lottie? Queen? Princess collicky kid?", "Filthy hobbitses!", "I kNoW yOu aRe BuT wHaT aM i? \ud83e\udd2a", "It is a big deal lol but OP is still the asshole. It took him 2 weeks to finally help his wife and *had* to do it on the  wedding day.", "I hope friends with colicky babies don\u2019t come to for sympathy.\n\nI get op is YTA, but so are you for that comment.", "Of course she deserves a break, but why did it have to be that day. Why couldn't they find someone else to help her? One of her friends or family members? Hired a mother's helper? So many options!", "Yes she deserves a break, but could have the day before and at least went to the ceremony. OP is the asshole", "Maybe, they put it through a translator? The reactions and linguistics do not sound Western.", "My husband's brother's wife is a nasty piece of work; he's not much better. Individually, they both have wide narcissistic streaks, entitlement issues (he was born into family money; they like to show off their \"success\"), substance issues, and are animal hoarders, and they have neglected/abused her 4 children (late teens-young adults now) to the point where they are in no way able to function in society. Together, they are toxic.  They don't even seem to like each other (are actively nasty or mean to each other, even in public), but also are grossly performative in their overuse of saccharine-sweet lovey-dovey pet names for and with each other, and baby-talk, even while being hateful to each other... It's unsettling.\n\nThe way these two have used pet names is so cringeworthy, anytime I see them used as partner-descriptors in the wild, I simply assume there's something fucked up happening in or around the relationship.  Nobody who actually likes their partner/has a heathy and stable relationship needs to be so over-the-top performative in proving how in love they are.", "A wedding is ideally not a common occurrence in a man\u2019s life. A colic is not a surprise life or death experience. \n\nA bit of planning and better communication would have done wonders.", "I mean it's hard work but it's not cancel going to a wedding level if difficult.", "no, im trivializing OP's train of thought (or lack of). Never once hinted that it was not something thats serious/hard to deal with\n\nnor did i ever say its something thats \"planned\"\n\nwhat im questioning is, and so many have pointed out (despite still not getting my point) its not something that happens suddenly that day\n\nremember OP pulled out ON THE DAY\n\nsurely this would be something that has happened...for some days at minimum? its safe to assume that? so its safe to assume OP had the chance to take action for a few days at least to either\n\n1) arrange help/care for wife and baby on the day \n\n2) make the decision to pull out of the duties", "Because her barely 2 week old infant was in pain and the needs of their child is more important than being an groomsman in a wedding. Y\u2019all are bat shit crazy.\n\nI would not be apologizing and I would not speak to these fuckers again.", "I know you mean \u201cmy precious Lottie\u201d but \u201cmy previous Lottie\u201d made me snort out my coffee. Thank you for the morning giggles.", "Like, right! Groady to the max.", "I thought my precious Lottie was the baby when she cried so much her little face was red", "I honestly wasn't even concerned about the age difference when they got together until you also notice the possessive and diminishing language. \n\nAnywho, OP is definitely TA, I would be very upset if my spouse skipped a sibling's wedding so that I could sleep, even having difficult children. It's one day, and he could have bowed out early, or I could have made it through the day alone and then he could come home and take over. I'd feel like I was blamed, that it was my fault. He's doubly the AH if she was unconscious and he just decided to bounce on the wedding without asking her. Because in this world, she's going to take most of the heat.\n\nI think this post is fake though, lol.", "Yeah it\u2019s not. OP is the asshole", "Still doesn't mean he bails the day of the wedding! There's no reason he couldn't have given him warning! I had a baby with colic and I would never think to let my husband stay home instead of going to his brother's wedding for a few hours. Your opinion is just bizarre!", "Autocorrect is a wonderful technology for which I am grapefruit! <edit> actually, the use of this type of sentence structure, using a possessive pronoun with a name \"his Lottie, my Sandy, her Jerry\" is fairly common among my older relatives who grew up speaking Polish.  It is like a word for word translation of an idiomatic expression.</edit>", "I haven't had enough caffeine to be on here yet.", "https://imgur.com/oKX5jYI"]}
