Maybe it's undiagnosed and/or untreated? \n\nI ask this because I have ADHD and it makes being on time, planning things, and just estimating the time it takes to do something INCREDIBLY difficult. In my case, it's not laziness, it's something that I'm physically not hardwired to do well. For example my bf once asked me to wake him in 15 minutes. I said sure and an hour later did so--it felt like 15 minutes to me. He was displeased, obviously. \n\nSo being on time is really hard for me BUT... that's not necessarily an excuse either. \n\nThere are also ways to deal with this. I have clocks everywhere--even in my bathroom. I set alarms. I purposely set aside waaaaay more time to get somewhere than I need to. I do as much as I can, beforehand--things like laying out my clothes and packing my lunch for work the night before. Literally even down to my underwear because I CAN take 10 minutes deciding which bra to wear. I also take Adderall which has helped ENORMOUSLY. But I still have to put the work in, adderall just makes it easier to do so. \n\nIn short, my ADHD is a reason why I struggle with punctuality, but not an excuse. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation about it?

Hell, when I\u2019ve had bad days in the past (still have them of course) and realized I was going to be late I\u2019ve told people to go ahead and keep to the planned time and that I would meet them there instead of riding together. It\u2019s one of those things where no matter how frustrating it is, the issue I\u2019m having is mine, not theirs, and I shouldn\u2019t expect them to miss out on things or change their plans for me when I mess up. He is struggling, probably feeling a ton of internal guilt/shame, and he\u2019s taking it out on you. I feel for him, I know how hard the emotions around all of this kinda thing can be, but you aren\u2019t responsible for them or him. It\u2019s on him to work on this and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be an enabler.", "NTA for considering leaving him, you have to think of yourself. \nIs it something you can deal with for the rest of your lives. Speaking from experience it's just who he is. My partner is the same has been since day 1, 17 years later if we have to be somewhere at a specific time I tell him we have to be there half an hour before we actually have to be. \nIf you love him and want to be with him there is ways and means around things. \nIf it's not something you want to deal with leave, he has told you that's who he is. Is it possible he may have ADHD, being late or basically time blind is a thing for people with ADHD", "Tell him your leaving. Then leave", "I\u2019m not saying to break up with him for it. But all I\u2019m saying is that my ex was like him and we broke up for different reasons, and one of the things I\u2019ve loved not being with her is traveling and getting ready for things. It\u2019s so stress free and I\u2019m realizing how damn punctual I really am.", " ESH\n You know he is time blind. You expect him to miraculously change.", "If he has time management problems that are chronic, then fine so do I.", "He told me that his time management has always been bad and will never change...", "Time management can be learnt. Alarms can be set. He can do better, but he doesn\u2019t think your worth it.", "He is rude and inconsiderate. He knows he's habitually late but doesn't value you or other people enough to do anything about it.", "It really doesn't matter whether he has ADHD or not. If he is, it might explain *why* it's difficult for him to be on time, but it doesn't change the fact he still has to figure out a way to not be late for shit, and he's already demonstrated he's unwilling to do that. Instead, he puts all the blame on OP. It's *her* fault she's upset he's late, and it's her fault she didn't book the flexible ticket (despite him telling her to get the cheaper one.) That's asshole behavior.", "My mother (75) has some type of (undiagnosed, untreated) executive dysfunction/attention disorder that makes her take an incredibly long time to get to a decision and to make a decision, and to execute on that decision. She has some kind of time blindness like you describe. My father passed away a few years ago, but he had a very different temperament and it was probably THE main stress point in their long-lasting, mostly harmonious marriage. She's only recently even started to accept that she MIGHT have some sort of attention problem.", "Thats the dumbest Take ive ever Heard", "> He told me that his time management has always been bad and will never change, so it\u2019s my mistake for not knowing that and not booking the flexible ticket. I told him that I had specifically asked him which ticket to book so that he could choose the flexible one if he thought that was safer. To which he responded that I should have known to just get that one and not believe him with these things at this point.\n\n\nTranslation: \u201cYour comfort matters so little to me I am unwilling to explore the *countless coping strategies* to address my time management. I am telling you now that you can *never ever trust me* and you must manage me as though I am not trustworthy when I make a commitment.\u201d \n\nNTA but this is not a kind/selfless person", "NTA, and you're not his mother, or personal assistant, or manager. If he can't respect the most valuable thing you have - your life time - he's not worth wasting said time on.", "Nta. You should start leaving without him.", "NTA but why are you with someone who is ok constantly inconveniencing you and tells you that your refusal to cater to him, as though he were a child, is the problem? \n\nBeing perpetually constantly late isn\u2019t a personality, it\u2019s a character flaw and something he needs to work on. If he refuses to do so, then have some self respect and find someone who works on their flaws instead of embracing them to the detriment of everyone around them.", "He is an excuse maker of a high order.He essentially says to ignore him because he is a fool.You see the problem. Good luck with the solution. NTA.", "He is an excuse maker of a high order.He essentially says to ignore him because he is a fool.You see the problem. Good luck with the solution. NTA.", "Leave him dont look back", "NTA but your BF is", "Ah.  The flaky man who wants you to manage his brain for him.  Always a treat.\n\nYou're NTA.  However you're now at the point where you have to decide what you're willing to put up with going forward.  Do you want to keep having this identical fight or accept him, obnoxious as he is being.  He's told you the truth about himself.  He's got no intention of changing his behavior and will be expecting you to manage his time forthwith.  This may or may not be the end of the world... the element of mommying your partner isn't the sexiest way to live your life, but the world is full of couples who live their lives \\*exactly\\* this way, and if he's decent otherwise it might be fine.", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds a bit like me. I often underestimate how long it will take me to get ready. But I do my damnedest to be better about it, so now I\u2019m rarely late for things anymore. It\u2019s something I have to be constantly vigilant about, but it works, and I do it because I care about my friends, family, and coworkers. Your boyfriend has the ability to change, he just doesn\u2019t care to.", "Is he your boyfriend or child?  NTA.", "NTA.  He doesn\u2019t respect you.  He told you that straight out and gaslighted you into believing that you\u2019re the AH, enough so that you made a list on Reddit.", "NTA and him blaming you for his behavior is not acceptable. Please OP, do not let this guy point the finger at you when he is the one causing the issue. Anyone can change their habits from bad to good, or they can change them from bad to worse.

Good luck OP.", "Is he late to work all the time and manages to keep a job or just when it's places where he's used to no consequences?\n\nNTA but I wouldn't be with someone who shows such a lack of respect for the time of others. Which is what someone who is always keeping others waiting is doing.", "NTA. None of his issue is your problem, he's basically asking you to anticipate his problems & schedule around them like a *parent* does for a literal child. If you have anxiety over punctuality (I do too) then this is probably not the relationship for you, especially since he seems to have very little respect for you in this regard.", "You should tell him ok if I would have left you and you felt like you should book a flight home then you go ahead. Knowing him he\u2019ll be late for that flight and blame you too. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Refusing to change the time management issue is a massive red flag, so is him telling you to buy the exclusive ticket and then saying you should've gotten the flexible one. You've dealt with this for 4 years and he said himself he won't change, he seems iffy.", "NTA but you can do better than someone who probably has adhd and refuses treatment or coping mechanisms. Its one thing if they try and fail, its another if they just make another/others deal with it and you dont wanna be that person, it sucks.", "NTA.  Being late to absolutely everything is a disease that some people choose to have.  They value their time above everyone else's.  I have friends and family like that, and I just never agree to do anything with them where I may have to wait for them.  I would never, ever date someone like that though, because from my experience that behavior literally never changes.  Every once in a while they'll only be 30 minutes late instead of an hour or two and they think they're heroes for it.", "NTA.  He wants a Mother, not a partner.  RED FLAG!  RUN", "You are NTA.  Time for you to consider if you can put up with his lack of time keeping for the rest of your life or move on in life without him.

Way to create a mountain out of a molehill.", "My father in law is like that. He missed his daughters wedding.", "NTA He is gaslighting you and trying to make you responsible for his behavior. Do you really want to live your life li,e this and with a person who has so little respect for you? Dump him.", "YTA if you know he never arrives on time and still expect it. Start telling him things start 30 minutes earlier than they actually do so he shows up early", "NTA, if you're understandably tired of this then breakup because he will never get better.  He obviously doesn't respect your time and has done jack shit to improve is garbage behavior.", "NTA\n He told you to not trust him and that he won't change. Why are you with this guy?", "It\u2019s also weird that a sling killing a guy is at all remarkable.", "NTA. There\u2019s zero reason why his time management \u201cwill never change.\u201d In general, be wary of anyone who claims to not be able to change their own behaviors.

He knows he is habitually late but doesn't value you or other people enough to do anything about it.", "It galls me that people have the arrogance to say this and expect people to stay.", "His excuse was that because he had to be on time for work appointments every day he couldn't be bothered to be on time for personal errands. After a few doses of his own medicine he realized that it was important to try to be on time so that his lateness did not inconvenience other people.", "Sorry, but lateness is rudeness. It's saying to the other party, \"I don't value your time at all, and therefore I don't respect you.\"\n\nAnd then, for them to make it abundantly clear that they have no intention of changing, that they see no problem in *continuing* to disrespect other people for the rest of their lives...that sounds rather toxic to me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Eh the problem remains the same: he isn\u2019t willing to explore any ways to improve, including any possible diagnosis.", "Could be a cultural thing too. Not sure where OP or BF are from, but there are cultures that see tardiness in very different ways.\n\nBeing Brazilian myself, I'm pretty much sure that when I'm hanging out with other Brazilians, that everyone will arrive 15-30 mins later than planned. In that case, being too early is considered to be more rude than being late and it's really not that big a deal.\n\nI put my partner through several similar situations as OP's BF when I was younger, since I didn't really see what was the big deal about being 10 minutes late. They then explained to me how in the US that's considered extremely rude and inconsiderate. That let me understand exactly why they were reacting the way they were and helped me understand why I should care about this.\n\nWell, I still was pretty shit at time management, so I just started adding stuff to my Google calendar 30 min before they were actually due. That worked perfectly and all those problems went away.\n\nSeems like he needs to figure out some way to understand exactly why he should care about this. \n\nMy hunch is, as also an ADHD-H dude, is that he doesn't really get why this bothers you so much. And finally, if this is something that's a big deal breaker for you or an annoyance to game plan around. \n\nIf it's the former, he'll have to do something about that and put some systems in place to make it work. And you'd have to make it clear that there are consequences if he doesn't.\n\n If it's the latter, you might have to add some buffer time and run less tight schedules, or tell him shit's going down earlier than it actually is so he arrives in time lmao.", "It could just be their nature though. My mum had a stroke and was in hospital. My brother still had the same lack of urgency.", "Bad time management does not poison him. What makes her toxic is that her partner expects her to read his mind and know better than him when he says otherwise. And refuses to even try to change. That's what makes him the TA here.", "I did kinda mention that he still has responsibility for managing ADHD if he has it. \n\nI just wanted to point out to OP that it might be at the root of all of this.", "Or perhaps he doesn't know that it's an actual medical problem that can be addressed?! \n\nIf you read my post you'll see that I'm not providing a blanket excuse for him to be late. Or to be a jerk about it. I'm simply providing info so that A. OP can relay this info to bf so he can get treatment for it. Sometimes having a label on a problem changes your approach to it. And B. Maybe OP can also realize this (might be) a legit medical issue and not straight up laziness and have a bit of empathy, as well. \n\nYelling at someone for something that is REALLY difficult for them, because of a neurological condition, is not helpful. In the moment I realize people snap.", "Well said. And as someone with ADHD myself, it absolutely CRUSHES me to be a disappointment to others and make them think that I don't care. I don't fault them for thinking that--but I sometimes do have to flat out tell people, \"I DO care about X. And I will try my very hardest to not disappoint or offend you.  But if I do X, please know that it's something that is physically very difficult for me to do.\"", "Child's take lol.", "I don't know how your brother lives with himself knowing his mother was in hospital after having a stroke and that event did not light a fire under his ass to go see her. I certainly cannot imagine making that sort of decision if a loved one was suddenly incapacitated and in the hospital and I was lackadaisical about going in to see them."]}
