When I was looking at booking the bus tickets I saw there were 2 options: restricted ticket where you can only get the bus at the time you select, or flexible allowing you to get any time (more expensive option).

There\u2019s zero reason why his time management \u201cwill never change.\u201d In general, be wary of anyone who claims to not be able to change their own behaviors.

It is not your job to carry the mental load for both of you. \n\nYou planned together and you are not an asshole for wanting to follow the plan that you both agreed on. \n\nHe is a big boy who can read a schedule, if a bus is leaving at X time that means you need to leave the house at X-Y time. If he is not ready on time then you are free to continue following the plan.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t be able to read his mind or secretly know what he needs better than he does.

Do you guys want to do other things in the future that require time organisation, such as having small humans? This would be diabolical with this man. You\u2019d be the one shouldering much of the burden.", "NTA\n\nHe is rude and inconsiderate.  He knows he is habitually late but doesn't value you or other people enough to do anything about it.  \n\nI had a friend who used to be like this.  His excuse was that because he had to be on time for work appointments every day he couldn't be bothered to be on time for personal ones.  After a few doses of his own medicine he came round to the idea that it's important to try to be on time so as not to inconvenience other people because of his tardiness.", "NTA. That said: have a proper talk (not while drunk) about this. Some people really, *really* struggle with time-management (people with ADHD, for example, though not exclusively).
