Maybe it's undiagnosed and/or untreated? \n\nI ask this because I have ADHD and it makes being on time, planning things, and just estimating the time it takes to do something INCREDIBLY difficult. In my case, it's not laziness, it's something that I'm physically not hardwired to do well. For example my bf once asked me to wake him in 15 minutes. I said sure and an hour later did so--it felt like 15 minutes to me. He was displeased, obviously. \n\nSo being on time is really hard for me BUT... that's not necessarily an excuse either. \n\nThere are also ways to deal with this. I have clocks everywhere--even in my bathroom. I set alarms. I purposely set aside waaaaay more time to get somewhere than I need to. I do as much as I can, beforehand--things like laying out my clothes and packing my lunch for work the night before. Literally even down to my underwear because I CAN take 10 minutes deciding which bra to wear. I also take Adderall which has helped ENORMOUSLY. But I still have to put the work in, adderall just makes it easier to do so. \n\nIn short, my ADHD is a reason why I struggle with punctuality, but not an excuse. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation about it?

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s on you to try and get him to help himself or manage things for him. I hope he decides to make more of an effort, I know how hard it can be to feel like it has always been hard and will always be hard\u2026 but he still needs to put the work in.\n\nYou would\u2019ve been completely in the right to leave without him. Hell, when I\u2019ve had bad days in the past (still have them of course) and realized I was going to be late I\u2019ve told people to go ahead and keep to the planned time and that I would meet them there instead of riding together. It\u2019s one of those things where no matter how frustrating it is, the issue I\u2019m having is mine, not theirs, and I shouldn\u2019t expect them to miss out on things or change their plans for me when I mess up. He is struggling, probably feeling a ton of internal guilt/shame, and he\u2019s taking it out on you. I feel for him, I know how hard the emotions around all of this kinda thing can be, but you aren\u2019t responsible for them or him. It\u2019s on him to work on this and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be an enabler.", "NTA for considering leaving him, you have to think of yourself. \nIs it something you can deal with for the rest of your lives. Speaking from experience it's just who he is. My partner is the same has been since day 1, 17 years later if we have to be somewhere at a specific time I tell him we have to be there half an hour before we actually have to be. \nIf you love him and want to be with him there is ways and means around things. \nIf it's not something you want to deal with leave, he has told you that's who he is. Is it possible he may have ADHD, being late or basically time blind is a thing for people with ADHD", "Tell him your leaving. Then leave", "I\u2019m not saying to break up with him for it. But all I\u2019m saying is that my ex was like him and we broke up for different reasons, and one of the things I\u2019ve loved not being with her is traveling and getting ready for things. It\u2019s so stress free and I\u2019m realizing how damn punctual I really am.", " ESH\n You know he is time blind. You expect him to miraculously change.", "If he has time management problems that are chronic, then fine so do I.", "He told me that his time management has always been bad and will never change...", "Time management can be learnt. Alarms can be set. He can do better, but he doesn\u2019t think your worth it.", "He is rude and inconsiderate. He knows he's habitually late but doesn't value you or other people enough to do anything about it.", "It really doesn't matter whether he has ADHD or not. If he is, it might explain *why* it's difficult for him to be on time, but it doesn't change the fact he still has to figure out a way to not be late for shit, and he's already demonstrated he's unwilling to do that. Instead, he puts all the blame on OP. It's *her* fault she's upset he's late, and it's her fault she didn't book the flexible ticket (despite him telling her to get the cheaper one.) That's asshole behavior.", "My mother (75) has some type of (undiagnosed, untreated) executive dysfunction/attention disorder that makes her take an incredibly long time to get to a decision and to make a decision, and to execute on that decision. She has some kind of time blindness like you describe. My father passed away a few years ago, but he had a very different temperament and it was probably THE main stress point in their long-lasting, mostly harmonious marriage. She's only recently even started to accept that she MIGHT have some sort of attention problem.", "Thats the dumbest Take ive ever Heard"]}
