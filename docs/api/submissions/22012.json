We have *both* compromised.  He's come to terms with leaving on time and I sort out everything I need the day before and I make a point of being ready 5 minutes earlier than the time he's given me to leave.\n\nIf you care about your partner, you make the effort to accommodate their crazy.

I don\u2019t think he does it on purpose. He\u2019s just last minute for everything. If he was anymore laid back, he would be in a coma. \n\nSometimes I must admit I do envy him.

Whereas my brother isn\u2019t bothered.", "I also think OP is NTA but--OP, does your bf have ADHD by any chance? Maybe it's undiagnosed and/or untreated? \n\nI ask this because I have ADHD and it makes being on time, planning things, and just estimating the time it takes to do something INCREDIBLY difficult. In my case, it's not laziness, it's something that I'm physically not hardwired to do well. For example my bf once asked me to wake him in 15 minutes. I said sure and an hour later did so--it felt like 15 minutes to me. He was displeased, obviously. \n\nSo being on time is really hard for me BUT... that's not necessarily an excuse either. \n\nThere are also ways to deal with this. I have clocks everywhere--even in my bathroom. I set alarms. I purposely set aside waaaaay more time to get somewhere than I need to. I do as much as I can, beforehand--things like laying out my clothes and packing my lunch for work the night before. Literally even down to my underwear because I CAN take 10 minutes deciding which bra to wear. I also take Adderall which has helped ENORMOUSLY. But I still have to put the work in, adderall just makes it easier to do so. \n\nIn short, my ADHD is a reason why I struggle with punctuality, but not an excuse. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation about it? And if he doesn't at least TRY then that's a different issue.", "Even if he has the intention to change, it just might not happen. I\u2019m frequently late and have always struggled with time management. I have ADHD and getting treatment has helped, but that has limits too. I care and I try but I\u2019m still late a lot. That may not make sense to other people and that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s my life and I have to deal with the consequences. But if it really bothers someone we probably won\u2019t be close- they\u2019re totally valid to have it bother them, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be able to change overnight. \n\nI also own the consequences and try to come up with solutions- I\u2019ve told my boyfriend he can give me fake times, for example, or I\u2019d understand if he leaves without me for something. Your BF\u2019s refusal to take accountability is the bigger problem here. He wants you to predict his needs and manage his life and that\u2019s not a reasonable ask. \n\nThe time thing might be a dealbreaker for you and that\u2019s ok.

Apparently I may perceive time differently than people without ADHD (I think studies are being done on time blindness and ADHD).

One, you work on managing and trying to get over your anxiety about being late, and deal with him the way he is. Two, you start lying to him about what time things actually start, so that you guys arrive at the time you want to be there instead of being late. Or three, you and the relationship and find somebody who's going to respect your anxieties when it comes to time, and respect other people's time as well.

I would rationalize why it would be okay for me to be late! And deep down, i didn't give a fuck. It IS possible to change. When I was in sober living I learned how to do it.

Not everyone has a functional internal clock.", "I have ADHD and so does my sibling. I still have *somewhat* of an internal clock (I can guess how much time has roughly passed, but I can\u2019t estimate how long certain things will take with much accuracy).  My sibling however has basically NO internal clock - they do not know if it\u2019s been ten minutes or two hours since they last looked. Measuring time makes no sense to their brain at all. Timed exams were impossible for them in school because they spent so much time looking at the clock to figure out how much time they had left that they couldn\u2019t actually use the time to take the exam. \n\nSo I understand what you\u2019re saying, and yes people with adhd can read a clock. But imagine that in every gap between checking a clock you don\u2019t know how long it has been since you last checked. \n\nHow would you solve that? I\u2019m not saying that to be sarcastic, it\u2019s actually a weird problem to consider. Would you just stare at the clock all day? Some people cope by setting alarms (and I\u2019ve seen screenshots of people maxing out the number of alarms they can even set on their phones). But living by alarm is also exhausting and you constantly have to remember to reset them (another thing hard for someone with executive dysfunction to sustain). \n\nI\u2019m not saying that people can\u2019t cope or create accommodations or seek to minimize their impact on others. It\u2019s \ud83d\udcaf% valid for OP to be frustrated and the impact on OP is real!\n\nBut in these conversations I also see some oversimplification of the problem, that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m commenting. People take their own internal clocks for granted, and often don\u2019t have any idea the work required to make up for it if you don\u2019t have one. I wouldn\u2019t say to my aging family members who walk slowly \u201cdon\u2019t you know wheelchairs exist?\u201d - that kinda shows a misunderstanding of what the problem is and what would actually help.  People whose brains don\u2019t mark time can\u2019t just look at a clock to solve everything. Doesn\u2019t mean they should inconvenience others or use it as an excuse, but any solution is probably going to be more complex than that.
