Not only will he always make his lack of time management your problem, he will, wherever possible, try to make it your fault.  People will find excuses for him (e.g. \"maybe he has undiagnosed ADHD\") but the truth of it is plain to see that he is disorganized and arrogant enough to think that everybody needs to accommodate him.  The next time you have to be somewhere at a specific time tell him that you are leaving at, say 8:00, and that if he isn't ready on time, you will leave without him and he'll be looking at tail-lights at 8:01.  THEN DO IT!  If that doesn't motivate him to change, either dump him or accept that the rest of your life will be chaos.   You haven't mentioned whether this problem extends to his job.  If it does, no employer will put up with chronic lateness so you can add unemployment and financial insecurity to your future.", "Completely agree, NTA.  So he knows this causes you distress but can't be bothered to change.  Doesn't this give you a bit of a clue on where you stand in the hierarchy of things?

My partner and I had similar issues when we started dating - he's always an anxious 20 minutes early and I am inevitably 5-15 minutes late because quite frankly being the first to arrive somewhere stresses me out (I'm always afraid I've been set up for a prank or been given the wrong address or something).  We have *both* compromised.  He's come to terms with leaving on time and I sort out everything I need the day before and I make a point of being ready 5 minutes earlier than the time he's given me to leave.\n\nIf you care about your partner, you make the effort to accommodate their crazy.  Only one of you is making the effort here.", "OP really needs to think about this relationship and the lack of respect therein\n\nImagine big important events, meeting families, wedding, children and their events, etc", "Honestly even if he has the intention to change, it just might not happen. I\u2019m frequently late and I really do work on it but it\u2019s a skill I have not mastered- and yes I do have ADHD so understanding that has helped, but it\u2019s still something I struggle with. That may not make sense to other people and that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s my life and I have to deal with the consequences. But if it really bothers someone we probably won\u2019t be close- they\u2019re totally valid to have it bother them, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be able to suddenly change when I\u2019ve been trying for years. It\u2019s like having a very messy partner- they can likely make work to be neater, but it might never be where you want it to be. \n\nThis might be a dealbreaker for you and that\u2019s ok.", "It's simple, it won't change b/c he doesn't see a problem with it.", "Some people just have bad time management. It doesn\u2019t make them toxic or anything. My brother is 40+ and has been the same for as long as I can remember.

I don\u2019t think he does it on purpose. He\u2019s just last minute for everything. If he was anymore laid back, he would be in a coma. \n\nSometimes I must admit I do envy him. I stress about being on time. Leave early to anticipate traffic etc and a million other things. Whereas my brother isn\u2019t bothered.", "I also think OP is NTA but--OP, does your bf have ADHD by any chance? Maybe it's undiagnosed and/or untreated? \n\nI ask this because I have ADHD and it makes being on time, planning things, and just estimating the time it takes to do something INCREDIBLY difficult. In my case, it's not laziness, it's something that I'm physically not hardwired to do well. For example my bf once asked me to wake him in 15 minutes. I said sure and an hour later did so--it felt like 15 minutes to me. He was displeased, obviously. \n\nSo being on time is really hard for me BUT... that's not necessarily an excuse either. \n\nThere are also ways to deal with this. I have clocks everywhere--even in my bathroom. I set alarms. I purposely set aside waaaaay more time to get somewhere than I need to. I do as much as I can, beforehand--things like laying out my clothes and packing my lunch for work the night before. Literally even down to my underwear because I CAN take 10 minutes deciding which bra to wear. I also take Adderall which has helped ENORMOUSLY. But I still have to put the work in, adderall just makes it easier to do so. \n\nIn short, my ADHD is a reason why I struggle with punctuality, but not an excuse. \n\nMaybe it's worth having a conversation about it? And if he doesn't at least TRY then that's a different issue.", "Even if he has the intention to change, it just might not happen. I\u2019m frequently late and have always struggled with time management. I have ADHD and getting treatment has helped, but that has limits too. I care and I try but I\u2019m still late a lot.

But if it really bothers someone we probably won\u2019t be close- they\u2019re totally valid to have it bother them, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be able to change overnight. \n\nI also own the consequences and try to come up with solutions- I\u2019ve told my boyfriend he can give me fake times, for example, or I\u2019d understand if he leaves without me for something. Your BF\u2019s refusal to take accountability is the bigger problem here. He wants you to predict his needs and manage his life and that\u2019s not a reasonable ask. \n\nThe time thing might be a dealbreaker for you and that\u2019s ok. The refusal to take responsibility _should_ be a dealbreaker regardless.", "bad time management doesn\u2019t make him toxic. what makes him toxic is expecting his partner to read his mind & know better than him when he\u2019s communicating the opposite. and refusing to even try to change. that\u2019s what makes him TA here.", "Going out with someone and trying to change them. Also makes OP TA."]}
