Now you say she can decline to help. Which is it?", "\u201c Not everyone is able to raise a child or should\u201d - but these women are not the real mothers, they are biological mothers only. The real mother is the one who tucks you in at night, hurts when you hurt, cheers you on, provides for your needs, raises you. That\u2019s the REAL mom. \n\nAlmost anyone can reproduce, that doesn\u2019t make them the real parent. Only those that hang around and raise their children or adopt and raise their children are the real parents. OP\u2019s real mother was her grandmother. (Edit to include step parents, friend\u2019s families and other relations who step up to parent, even if they dont have the ability to adopt.)", "Yea that'd the kinda polite lie you tell a mother who hasn't previously abandoned you.", "I just think the language is a bit exclusionary/judgemental? Especially since someone can be a parent, step away, come back, etc. \"Turning her back\" basically applies to any circumstances where someone doesn't engage with their child for any period, with no recognition of nuance. And the idea that someone has to meet certain criteria to be a \"real\" mom can be kind of toxic? Since that implies that moms who struggle are somehow \"fake\" which is a level of judgement that isn't necessary. Like in the story, the woman is still a mom, even if she doesn't have a right to claim she's *OP's* mom.\n\nLike, the mom who has a mental health crisis and has to step away from parenting for everyone's safety, and then wants to reestablish connection with her children, is that not a 'real' mom because she wasn't able to handle everything all at once? Or the teenaged mother who makes the hard choice between raising her child herself likely in poverty or finishing her education and chooses the best life for both of them, is she somehow a 'fake' mother? Are their experiences less real/valid? I'd personally say no.\n\nMotherhood is a complex thing, and means different things in different cultures and to different people. So it makes me balk when someone says something that basically implies that all women who aren't 110% behind their children all the time must automatically be considered not mothers. All people who can't care for their offspring aren't like OP's mother, and in a lot of cases it's a very difficult thing for them and they shouldn't be excluded from the concept of motherhood because they were dealt a bad hand. If their children don't want to know them or have a relationship with them, that's their choice and valid. Someone does not have to be the person their bio-kid considers a mother to be a mother, and it only takes one person to sever a relationship like that. But it's usually more harmful than helpful to make broad sweeping statements about who gets to be considered a \"real\" part of a group.  Especially since it can contribute to stigmatizing things like mothers making time for themselves, getting support they need, taking care of themselves, etc.\n\nMotherhood is having a connection with a child, whether biological or not. It's the good times, and the bad times, and the hard times where you have to make tough choices. A person may not have the right to claim a specific child as theirs (by their choice or the child's or other circumstances), may have needed time or space, or made mistakes. But that doesn't invalidate their experience of motherhood entirely.", "Okay, I've edited my post slightly to reflect the fact that when I say \"not everyone is able\" I meant both at all and people who have rough patches, because that wasn't clear enough. \"A real mother never turns her back on her child\" technically means that the single mother of three who works three jobs and doesn't have the time or energy or money to deal with her child getting (verbally) bullied and so ignores or doesn't notice it is not a \"real mother,\" which is a problem for the definition.\n\nA point that may not have come accross in my initial post- being **A** mother and being **A SPECIFIC PERSON'S** mother are different things. If a person, especially an adult, doesn't consider someone their mother, that's their choice and usually valid. It's okay to not want to associate with or care about a person who hurt you or wasn't there for you, regardless of their reasons why. You are not obligated to forgive, or move past what happened, or anything like that.\n\nBut \"motherhood\" as a term represents a wide variety of diverse experiences. Of having children, of raising them, and sometimes of letting them go. Of making mistakes where you don't stand by them, or dealing with times where you can't. Othering people who are part of that group for not living up to your standards, or for making mistakes, isn't a reasonable thing to do. And it also increases stigma against moms getting help they need, having difficulties, etc. by implying that because they were dealt a bad hand they are *failing* at motherhood, which is a very toxic way of looking at things.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while it can be good/empowering for people to tell themselves and the people in their lives \"\\[bio-parent\\] is not my real mom, \\[person who looks after me\\] is my real mom,\" that doesn't mean that's how we should define motherhood altogether. The language a victim (either of direct action or circumstances) uses should focus on what will help them cope/heal, the laguage that the general public uses should generally focus on not being exclusionary, incorrect, or likely to cause harm."]}
