We are both 25 (I'm male). So.. my fianc\u00e9 \"Ember\" has, what I believe, is unresolved trauma. Growing up her house was filthy. I mean, dog shit everywhere, dirty clothes everywhere, dishes spilling out of the sinks, garbage all over the floor (they literally didn't have garbage bags in their house) and literally no food. She often jokes about having an \"ingredient household\" but it roughly translates to the fact that she didn't eat unless it was like.. a can of corn with ketchup, which her and her brother often mixed together as kids for flavor. She had a rough life but she honestly smiles while recounting it because she made it out \"unscathed\". She didn't, mentally, but my Lord does she put up a front so good sometimes that I truly believe even she believes it. Her brother on the other hand.. he turned to heroin. So she basically sees it as a \"well, I could be worse\". She has weird triggers. Blankets being a huge one. Blankets on floors, specifically. \n\nSo my family came to visit us this weekend. It was my sister, my sister's husband, their kid and they brought their 2 dogs (they asked first). I should have said no to the dogs. I can now see that dogs are 100% a trigger and just about as big as the blankets on the floor issue. Basically, they are staying in our living room. Whenever they get off one of the couches, they push the blankets on the floor and leave them. I've heard my fianc\u00e9 say several times \"don't leave the blankets on the floor please\" and even last night I heard her repeat it to them. Well, this morning they took one of the blankets from the closet and put it on the floor for their dog. My fianc\u00e9 literally looked at me with panic all over her face and snapped at me to handle it. I didn't even ask questions. I just went in and told them to get their dog off the blanket and to get the blanket off the floor. Just to make it clear: my family 100% knows of my fianc\u00e9s issues. I've spoken to them about it several times and they all seemed super understanding UNTIL they got here. Now it's \"weird\". Well.. they started talking about it not being a big deal. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 came in to the room. Her hands basically pulling her hair from digging her head (she does it to calm down). She started calm and quickly blew up while telling them to get their dogs out and to leave and about how she's been pushed past her breaking point and how they are disrespectful, etc. She was screaming, 100%, tears pouring out of her head. My family looked at me and started in about her being \"fucking crazy\" and I defended my fianc\u00e9. Told them to leave. My mom is saying I'm a POS for letting my fianc\u00e9 do that and said I defended the wrong person.

First, your family are guests in your house and knew about her extreme aversion to blankets on the floor. Both you and Ember asked multiple times for them to pick the blankets up. Not respecting your wishes is rude and you are right to defend your fianc\u00e9. Secondly, I think your fianc\u00e9 really needs to go to therapy. It sounds like she grew up in a hoarder house which can be very traumatizing because you\u2019re essentially dealing with the hoarders trauma while developing your own trauma. Her fears and struggles are valid but she can learn ways to calm herself when she starts getting anxious. As someone who is also anxious about a lot of things I know how bad it feels to have an anxiety/panic attack. It\u2019s not fun and can sometimes make me feel terrible physically too. Therapy won\u2019t erase the trauma or fears but it can help with coping techniques.", "NTA \n\nThat is her safe space and it is needed. \n\nI would\u2019ve given you a soft YTA for not reiterating the boundaries and rules needed in your home with them, but this should be a lesson to do that with everyone from now on.", "NTA at all. Also, if you ever have guests in the future and are unsure if they will respect your rules, you can fold up all of the blankets and move them from your living room to your bedroom, so your guests won't have an opportunity to leave them lying on the ground.", "NTA you definitely defended the right person because she's the one who is your new family. Your family knows her issues, was told by both of you multiple times not to do something, but did it anyway. How insensitive can they be?! They owe your fianc\u00e9e and you apologies.", "INFO:  had they been informed that blankets on the floor, specifically, were a trigger?", "NTA! Good job defending your partner! Even if there was no trauma involved, isn't it weird to go to someone else's house and put the hosts blankets on the floor for dogs to sleep on? This just seems dirty and gross and disrespectful. Bring a dog bed for your pets to lay on. I think anyone would have gotten upset if this happened a bunch of times. \n\nStill though, your partner probably needs therapy to help deal with triggers.", "NTA. You defended the right person. Your fianc\u00e9 is allowed to have standards within her own home. Your family is being disrespectful of her boundaries, whether they agree with them or not.", "NTA. They were pushing for days,they are guest and should respect the rules of the house, family or not, I would say family is even more disrespectful for not respecting the rules.", "My kids used to do this. What happened was they were sitting/laying on the couch with a blanket, would get up without taking the blanket off and as they stood up the blanket would slide to the ground. It's a childish bad habit that the adults should have outgrown by now.", "They\u2019d been reminded, so yes they were aware.", "I guess that makes sense. Maybe it is just the wording OP used that is throwing me off. Normally, I associate pushing with hands, kicking with feet, and \"falling off\" with what you just described.", "I just figured these were extremely lazy and entitled adults that were never corrected as children. Something is in their way or uncomfortable they push it off. \n\nThe giving the dog a blanket from the closet also threw me. I love my dogs, they are my fur babies. But I bring their bedding with me when we travel. I would never go into someone else's home and take a blanket to give my dogs without asking. I wouldn't need to do that in the first place. Their blankets get packed with their food and toys."]}
