They were just letting her know that what she was drinking wasn't vegan. Like telling a Jewish person who keeps kosher \"just so you know, that dish has bacon fat in it\" or something like that.\n\nIt read like courtesy. If she was not deeply self conscious about your image (and what is the point of friends if you have to worry about that kind of bullshit around them) it wouldn't have offended her.", "Agreed. Vegan here too and I only learned that some wine isn't vegan when I saw a brand being marketed as vegan-friendly. OP sounds *extremely* accommodating. If I am going to a friend's house I bring snack and wine that suits my needs and am very appreciative when someone wants to make something vegan for me (but never expect it!). OP is definitely NTA and honestly her friend needs to do some self reflection before she loses all her friends.", "Vegan here! It takes roughly 9 plant calories to generate 1 animal calorie, so it's a really inefficient way to make food. Yes, there are animals which die due to agricultural practices, but when you need to grow nine times the amount of food to grow meat, you're really compounding the issue (plus all the other environmental issues caused by factory farming).", "Has this approach ever worked for you to convert someone? I'm vegan, for the record.", "There are some great vegan and cruelty free indy brands at least! Off the top of my head, mooncat, holo taco and kbshimmer. I think there's more than that too but those are the ones I've personally tried.", "They care deeply about honey that's produced as a natural byproduct of bees living their lives or eggs that chickens just naturally lay, but it's fine if human undocumented laborers work in horrible conditions to grow their produce.", "Also grass touched by wind is also not vegan because a bird may have flown in the air", "Yeah, I wonder how much of this is influenced by cultural norms. I\u2019m Indian and grew up in India and so many foods here are naturally vegan. Home style Indian food is very different from the Indian food you find in the west, which is often dairy heavy and heavily features dishes from a couple of northern states (India has 29 states each with their own traditional cuisine), so I have never been in a situation where someone had to go out of their way to accommodate me. Literally never. Most of my family is vegetarian, and many dishes are naturally dairy free in home style cooking so they\u2019re vegan. Most meat eaters in India only eat meat a few times a week- it\u2019s always been a luxury because our traditional plant based dishes are so much more affordable. It\u2019s a given that every social event will have at least a few vegan options, especially in my part of the country. \n\nI also don\u2019t feel overly concerned about expecting people to accommodate me because it is so common to have vegan dishes, but I can see how that would be very different in a culture where that\u2019s not as normal and requires extra effort from the hosts. \n\nI do think it\u2019s nice of OP to make an effort to accommodate this friend.", "Kind of dumb thing to be concerned about. Unless you grow your own organic vegetables and fruits it's not vegan. Millions of animals are killed every year, to prepare land for growing crops, like corn, soybean, wheat, barley, etc.", "Pacifica and Nailtopia both have vegan nail polish too!", "They do this for avocados too.", "\u201cFor anyone wondering about this, it's not the natural, incidental pollination that some vegans object to--industrial-scale almond cultivation uses \"managed pollination\", whereby beekeeping conglomerates transport thousands of hives to the almond groves for pollination season.\u201d -from a comment above yours", "Exactly, if it's a personal choice and not mainly a way to make yourself feel superior, then it's not a big deal if you make a mistake.", "Meh, I'm not going to make value judgements about someone's lifestyle choices that don't affect me or anyone else.\n\nThat said, I'm not going to continue to spend time with someone who doesn't extend me the same courtesy. I generally don't put myself in situations where someone is going to try to make me feel bad because I'm not ideologically pure enough with respect to what I eat.", "Bees are used in large industrial farms that produce lots of fruits. They\u2019re all over the Yakima valley in spring. When they\u2019re done there they are put on 18 wheelers and head for the next crop. \n\n I believe almonds take an inordinate amount of water compared to other crops. But that\u2019s not a vegan issue obviously.", "According to Wikipedia, drupes are a type of fruit.\n\nThat said, I didn't even know drupes were a thing. So I dunno.", "Natural pollination isn't incidental. It's the way nature intended, there's nothing more natural than that.\n\nVegans just love attention over nothing.", "I took the time to go through our stock and find out which wines are vegan, so if someone looks lost, I just ask if they need a hand. 9 times out of 10, someone is buying for a friend so they don't know what to look for.\n\nI do wish they'd label them like they do with the zero alcohol wines though (giant sticker on front of bottle) , instead of having a little symbol on the back of the bottle.", "Thank you so much for the image of a bunch of bees peacefully flying in a straight line into 18 wheelers to move to another crop. I know how they are actually moved, but it just was an awesome image in my head.", "It\u2019s more about the current practices around beekeeping and pollinating the almond trees. Lots of bees die in the process - due to pesticides used in the almond orchards. almond orchards are also not an environment that can sustain bees so they die in greater numbers.\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/honeybees-deaths-almonds-hives-aoe", "Which is why they will eat fruit and veggies, because bees pollinate it the way that nature intended, instead of being forced and killed in the process like with the almond industry. If you want to converse on this, find a vegan or the person I got that comment from, I don\u2019t care enough to say anything more about it, honestly. I\u2019m far from vegan, I was raised on a farm. I ate chickens that I helped raise. But I get the sense that you don\u2019t want to converse anyways, you just love to hate over not saying anything at all.", "Thanks! I'm not a huge wine drinker, but do love a Moscato. This is a helpful list since I'd like to support wineries that care enough to clearly list they're vegan \ud83d\ude0a Barnivore is a great site, but it's so *huge* it can be overwhelming!", "You don't care yet you just wrote out a whole paragraph telling me how much you don't care. Good job \ud83d\ude18", "Oof, and I thought my elementary school was bad, your school didn\u2019t even teach you what a paragraph is! I think khan academy is free, if you want to fix that :)", "For someone who doesn't care, you sure seem to care a lot. A paragraph is multiple concurrent sentences.\n\nThough I suppose that can't be considered a proper paragraph considering most of it was you babbling on without using proper punctuation.", "Haha, funny you\u2019d like to say something about punctuation \ud83d\ude02 I said one sentence about how I don\u2019t care, so did they not teach you what a paragraph is or did they not teach you what \u201cmultiple\u201d means? bless your heart honey I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s got you so miserable with your life, but you\u2019ll have to find someone else to drag down with ya because I stay level <3 can\u2019t be down when you\u2019ve got good music pouring through beautiful headphones :D"]}
