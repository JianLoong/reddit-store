Like, if she was a true vegan, she would've checked first. Shes just upset that she was called out for not being as \"dedicated\" as she was pretending to be in front of people. \n\nPeople change. I know she's been your closest friend and helped you a lot, but people change. And sometimes not for the better.\n\nEDIT: my bad for using the word true vegan. But her reaction to me doesn't seem like someone who truly believes in why they are vegan. Yeah, she made a mistake by not checking the wine, but her reaction after being told is what is the problem.", "NTA. She helped herself to wine in your house and you explained it wasn't vegan. You were doing her a favour. I bet if you had said nothing and she later on discovered it wasn't vegan she would of called you a bad friend. Sounds like she wants to be right all the time and that she's arrogantly obnoxious.", "NTA. You made her aware that she wasn't drinking vegan wine. Not all wine is vegan and it's on her to check what she's consuming is vegan if that's her lifestyle choice", "She was a guest - what food and drink you keep in your fridge is your business - not hers. You didn't gve her the non-vegan wine, she helped herself to it out of your fridge. Serve her right. Not bad host - but rude guest. Not to mention she's a Vegan who didn't know that not all wines are Vegan - Life choice or just attention seeking?", "NTA but she\u2019s about so have zero friends if she keeps up that attitude", "Nope, NTA at all. Good of you to tell her.", "NTA\n\nNow you got me all curious as to how wine could be vegan and non vegan.", "NTA  Been there, experienced that.  Vegans can get very defensive about the stupidest stuff.  You went out of your way to get a vegan version for them and just let them know that it wasn't the vegan version that they were consuming.  Why is this \"calling them out\" when veganism is a restriction that only they put on themselves?  Literally no one else cares if they eat animal products or not.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She went into your fridge without asking first and drank something that didn\u2019t fit her diet when there was an alternative that did suit her diet available for her. It\u2019s good that you pointed it out to her since being a vegan is so important to her to the point where she is willing to alienate herself from loved ones. Had this been a situation where she was allergic to something she had just consumed, your comment could have saved her life - she most likely lashed out in embarrassment more than anything else. Good on you for respecting people\u2019s diets, shame on her for taking advantage of your hospitality.", "NTA\n\nIt would of been an AH move to let your vegan friend to continue drinking it knowing it wasn\u2019t vegan. Your friend should of been more understanding of you letting her know.", "Hey, she's vegan and not the pleasant kind. Her fault for drinking wine that isn't vegan. You are in the clear bro.", "Assuming you informed her kindly, NTA.

It's up to the vegan to look up to confirm if something is vegan, and it's your house and you are not vegan- why would you go out of your way to only have vegan wines?\n\nAs a vegetarian, I always appreciate warning if someone knew something in their house that appears vegetarian wasn't before I ate it- as would my stomach, honestly, as I get nausea and other unpleasant GI issues if I accidentally eat things like chicken stock that might sometimes be in certain foods, or bacon grease or lard if something was cooked in it without being obvious. I don't get upset, I just accept that not everything in other people's houses is me-friendly, even IF they say I'm free to eat or drink whatever I please.

Yeah, isinglass (fish product) is used in filtration. Also technically some wines can contain egg traces, and I believe something derived from milk. There's a range of animal products used in wine filtration.\n\nYou told her about an issue and she clearly didn't care. Her lack of attention is what caused this.
