We will likely never live in a truly cruelty-free society. Do your best. My personal thing I advocate to people who don\u2019t want to give up meat, dairy, or eggs, is to eat less of it, but eat higher quality meats. This strategy has the highest likelihood of succeeding (as higher quality, smaller farms, and local animals are often times raised with less cruelty than mass produced factory farming operations) while not being totally life altering to people from a cultural perspective. Same thing with buying chicken eggs from a neighbor or local farmer vs factory farmed eggs. \n\nTo;dr: \u201c the winemaking process, specifically the fining process, often adds small amounts of substances that may be troubling to vegetarian and vegan consumers.

That said, I always welcomed new information because it enabled me to make informed decisions about what I choose to consume.

Instead she\u2019s angry that you told her in front of people because she feels that it makes her look inconsistent or even inauthentic in her veganism.
