Cola was 6 and her passing was very unexpected. She was a birthday gift from my late best friend and I loved her so much so her passing really devastated me and my husband. \n\nShe was a black mini dachshund with white spots, very gentle and sweet. She rarely barks and she gets along with other people well, that's why kids love her. My husband and I don't have a child yet so Cola was our baby and we brought her everywhere. \n\nMy nephew, Colin (5M, not his real name), took a serious liking of Cola that whenever we visit my in-laws, he would play with her and even sleep with her. He even made jokes that he will take her home. So when we broke the news that Cola died, he took it hard and was unconsolable.\n\nMy husband, angel of a human that he is, gifted me with a customized Cola toy for my birthday. He found a site that makes custom-made stuffed toys of pets to help grieving owners to heal. The stuffed toy really looks like Cola, from her spots to her chipped left ear, and the quality is great. I love his gift so much that I posted an appreciation post with few snaps of my Cola toy.\n\nApparently, my SIL (Colin's mom), saw my post, showed it to Colin and told me that Colin wants the Cola toy. I of course told her I can't give him Cola because it was a gift and to be totally honest, I don't want to. SIL got angry and told me it was a kid's toy and Colin loves Cola so I can give him the toy. I told her I'm not changing my mind. \n\nAfter that encounter, my MIL called me demanding to give my Cola toy to Colin as he was already throwing tantrums and l should be considerate. If I won't give the Cola toy, I should buy Colin a new one. I told my husband this but he said that it was quite expensive to order a customized toy and he won't buy Colin a new one since my SIL apparently still owe him a lot of money. \n\nSo I told MIL that I can help them order but we will not pay for it as my husband and I agreed, and she told me to stop being selfish and give the toy to her grandchild. My husband and I are firm with keeping Cola toy, but some of our friends told us that we should just cave in and order another one for ourself.\n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for my grammar, I am not a native English speaker.", "created_utc": 1683447537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ahcac/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_customized_stuffed/", "score": 467, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They think your stuff is theirs to give away. \n\nThere\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that the child doesn\u2019t actually want it that much.\n\nMy thoughts are that MIL and SIL should put their money where their mouths are. \n\nHow much would you pay for a toy for the child?. Say you\u2019ll chip in whatever amount seems reasonable for you to pay for \u2018soft toy for 5yo child\u2019 and will help set it up, but that they\u2019ll need to make up the rest. \n\nThen suggest a daschund beanie baby or something that is within that \u2018reasonable child\u2019s toy\u2019 budget. \n\nIf they aren\u2019t willing to dig into their pockets, this isn\u2019t about a child\u2019s grief at all, it\u2019s about them being cross they can\u2019t control you.

Entertaining this makes him think he has a right to YOUR totem to remember a lost pet, I\u2019ll even go as far as to say loved one, considering how you talked about Cola and where you got her! She would rather be comfortable and not have to go through the trouble of sitting the child down, explaining why he cannot have the toy, and dealing with any further meltdowns. Maybe it\u2019s just the way I\u2019m wired, but a respectful person would\u2019ve never even involved in this issue, because you are dealing with the death of an animal.

No. No.\n\nAnd no to your friends who say to just get it over with and give to your nephew. They do know what that entails, right? Giving up your toy that looks like your dog and reason for healing? No.", "Nta. Have husband send them a link so they can order their own.", "NTA.

But I don't care if it's a dirty sock--how dare these people demand she give them anything of hers! SIL and MIL aren't teaching the kid about other people's feelings.

Its a shame he has so many people willing to cater to his tantrum.  That being said, i think you may be borrowing trouble on this one.\n\nFor you, who knew every last detail of your canine child, the expensive exact replica is important.  For a 5 year old, any dachshund stuffy will be seen as \"his cola\".  Keep saying no now, but maybe on his birthday give him his own cheap Cola and the two stuffed pups can play together and do a photo shoot or something.  He will love it, and his happiness will shut down the crazies from everyone else.  Next time your sister calls ask to speak to your nephew.  Tell him you can't give him your Cola but you think very own cola is out there trying to find his way home.", "NTA, but this is exactly why I don\u2019t use Facebook. Too much drama that can be easily avoided.", "Nta. Please make sure you lock either your bedroom or the stuffy up when they are going to visit.

There are three people throwing tantrums here and the only one remotely understandable for doing so is Colin, and only because he is a child and has shitty parents. Stand your ground and don't let your inlaws bully you.", "Nta, if anything, send her a link to the service. Does the cousin normally throw tantrums over not getting his way? If not, then this would be part of the inconsolable mourning, which would only put aunt at fault for not handling her child's emotional troubles and instead using it to take advantage of others.

It\u2019s sad that the kid is so upset about the dog passing but it was your dog and your husband bought you a very sweet gift about him.
