Cola was 6 and her passing was very unexpected. She was a birthday gift from my late best friend and I loved her so much so her passing really devastated me and my husband. \n\nShe was a black mini dachshund with white spots, very gentle and sweet. She rarely barks and she gets along with other people well, that's why kids love her. My husband and I don't have a child yet so Cola was our baby and we brought her everywhere. \n\nMy nephew, Colin (5M, not his real name), took a serious liking of Cola that whenever we visit my in-laws, he would play with her and even sleep with her. He even made jokes that he will take her home. So when we broke the news that Cola died, he took it hard and was unconsolable.\n\nMy husband, angel of a human that he is, gifted me with a customized Cola toy for my birthday. He found a site that makes custom-made stuffed toys of pets to help grieving owners to heal. The stuffed toy really looks like Cola, from her spots to her chipped left ear, and the quality is great. I love his gift so much that I posted an appreciation post with few snaps of my Cola toy.\n\nApparently, my SIL (Colin's mom), saw my post, showed it to Colin and told me that Colin wants the Cola toy. I of course told her I can't give him Cola because it was a gift and to be totally honest, I don't want to. SIL got angry and told me it was a kid's toy and Colin loves Cola so I can give him the toy. I told her I'm not changing my mind. \n\nAfter that encounter, my MIL called me demanding to give my Cola toy to Colin as he was already throwing tantrums and l should be considerate. If I won't give the Cola toy, I should buy Colin a new one. I told my husband this but he said that it was quite expensive to order a customized toy and he won't buy Colin a new one since my SIL apparently still owe him a lot of money. \n\nSo I told MIL that I can help them order but we will not pay for it as my husband and I agreed, and she told me to stop being selfish and give the toy to her grandchild.
