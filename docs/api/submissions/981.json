Since I started working here, I realised nobody really talks to A and everybody sees him as creepy or weird. I have a soft spot for persons I believe are \u201cleft out\u201d and A sits very close to me so I\u2019ve always been friendly towards him. \n\nSince my first week, A expressed his interest in me and I politely declined by lying and saying I was in a relationship, I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings (see disclaimer). I was still friendly towards him and I thought everything was strictly friendly. Well first A invited me to a very intimate event of his, which I did not attend. He then expressed his interest in us going somewhere alone, which honestly sounded like a date to me, so I again declined. \n\nRecently he again told me he likes me and I told him again I wasn\u2019t interested. I thought that would\u2019ve been the end of it, but the next day he showed me a poem he wrote for me basically calling me his soulmate and expressing his love for me. This really creeped me out and while I did not openly express my discomfort to him in the moment (I was shocked ), I talked to my supervisor about it.\n\nMy supervisor took it really seriously and escalated the issue, which resulted in A getting called to a meeting with HR. A hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. \n\nThe conflict is that some of my friends are saying I should have expressed my discomfort to him first before going to my supervisor because maybe he didn\u2019t know I was uncomfortable. I can 100% understand that but I was honestly just shocked and very creeped out.

This is a matter for HR. It sounds like A was alone and considered a creep because he displayed this kind of behavior before. There would have been someone else after you. Definitely HR's wheelhouse, you did nothing wrong. Plus, you did raise it to him first, more than once, based on your own account.", "You told your coworker 'no' multiple times and they still continued to escalate. 'No' is not a 'maybe', it's a definitive answer. You did the right thing speaking to your supervisor and HR. NTA.", "You did express your \u2018discomfort\u2019 directly to him with each and every \u2018no\u2019. \n\nHe was completely disregarding your clear boundaries and was escalating his behavior and you did the right thing in reporting it to HR. NTA", "NTA.  It sounds like you were clear that you were not interested.  Since this happened in the workplace, going to HR was an appropriate next step", "NTA, that is what HR is for.  Let them remind him of the boundaries he cant cross in a professional setting so you can continue to do the job you are paid to do.  It seems he has not been fired which means they only had to talk to him and note it in his file for future issues.  best stop it now before addressing it when hes taken it to more aggressive interactions (saves you and him).  Also, it sucks that you cant be nice to someone in a work environment and them taking it to \"you're my soulmate\" awkwardness levels.  Some people are not great at reading signals or even direct roadblocks!", "NTA - you *did* make your discomfort known. You said no, more than once. That should have been the end of it, he deserved what he got. No means no.", "Nta at all. He was told more than once you weren\u2019t interested and didn\u2019t respect being told no. Worrying for his future relationships! Glad hr is taking it seriously", "NTA - He was creating a hostile environment and it's not your responsibility to school him.  I really can't stand this mindset that women are supposed to just take crap from AHs like this and wheedle and plead not to be harassed.  And what he was doing was outright sexual harassment.  Frankly, I feel as if he should have been fired on the spot--there's no way an adult male who can manage to get himself to work every day doesn't know that what he was doing was well beyond the pale.  Just today a news story came out about a woman who is no longer living because a coworker wouldn't take no as no.  No idea what sort of escalation to HR went on there, but frankly, given this, if they were smart, they would get him gone--NOW.", "NTA\nYou had told A multiple times no, when he persisted in an increasingly creepy way, you were right to go to a supervisor and the supervisor was right to go to HR", "NTA He really can't catch a clue on his own, so you helped him. Hopefully if it happens again he'll listen and not to his delusions \ud83e\uddd0\ud83d\udcaf", "INFO: What about him makes people think he's creepy or weird? Is it possible he's on the spectrum or there's an underlying reason he has difficulty picking up signals other people would? Or is he like... sexual creepy guy?", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell? You expressed your discomfort to him many more times than you ever should\u2019ve. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA - you did speak with your coworker. You declined his advances and told him you were in a relationship. Your coworker ignored your response and escalated his advances. Discussing his continued harassment with your supervisor was an appropriate course of action. BUT repeat this until you believe it: you don't need the excuse of being in another relationship to decline someone's advances.  Just say, No, nope, not interested. You don't need a reason.  Be firm and direct, like ripping off a bandaid.", "You *did* speak to A and made it very clear that you were not interested. Speaking to your supervisor was the right thing, as was their taking it to HR. That is not appropriate behavior, especially for a workplace. \n\nNTA - that is blatant sexual harassment.", "NTA. You told him more than once that you weren\u2019t interested, it\u2019s on him for taking that to mean he should try harder. You did the right thing.", "NTA. You told him several times you weren\u2019t interested and he wouldn\u2019t back off.", "NTA. You told him no more than once, and that should\u2019ve been enough. You did the right thing", "NTA you told him several times you were not interested, what makes you think that if you told him you were uncomfortable he would've listened? A clearly doesn't understand when to stop. I think you made the right call. Everything he was doing was during work and this was making you very uncomfortable. Some people really act like they do nothing wrong and then are shocked when things like this happen. Do not feel bad for A, he is an adult and he needs to understand that actions have consequences. And as for the friends that told you that you should have spoken to A first, they clearly did not think that you saying no several times was not enough, that's  a problem.", "NTA. You have a right to work without having to be considerate of someone who fantasizes about more with you, and you don't even need to feel obligated to let them know why. You were right to involved HR. If you hadn't and he escalated behavior or retaliated once you demonstrably rejected him, who knows what he would have done. Is it likely he would have been violent? Not particularly. Does it need to be violent to negatively impact your life? Nope. I knew a guy that would try and give overly difficult tasks to one of his subordinates after being rejected. He thought no one would notice. After I fired him, encouraged the girl to file a restraining order, and got a trespass order issued at our workplace, I figured he would drop it. Wrong. He stalked her one evening to a local bar where I moonlighted as a bouncer and tried to come in after she did. She told me on her way in that she spotted him at a couple of other places earlier. I met him at the door and let him know he wasn't welcome, and he blurted out \"I'm going to see her whether you like it or not\" and tried to push his way in. He tried to swing, I popped his shoulder out of socket. The paramedics looked him over, popped the shoulder back, and gave him to the cops. We trespassed him at the bar, and he got charged with simple assault and for violating the restraining order. Point being, you don't know this guy. This type of shit is more common than you think, and there are plenty of assholes that do not see women as anything but an object to be had. Don't let anyone tell you to suffer this type of discomfort where you make a living...sitting through a policy meeting and enduring harassment should never be considered the same ball park in any measure.", "NTA. This is a work problem, you took it to your boss, end of story. Fragile, male feelings can't always be the first priority.", "NTA-\n\n Appreciate that you tried to make a friend at work... However, what he was doing is sexual harassment. You told him no several times. He kept harassing you anyway. \n\nAnd yeah... Maybe when people tell you that someone harasses coworkers it's not because everyone in the office is an AH but maybe because he sexually harasses coworkers... Which you now know first hand. Sometimes folx are misunderstood. This dude is not misunderstood... His behavior is harassment.", "NTA, but FYI as someone who was in your shoes once. Some companies will NOT do anything about sexual harassment accusations UNLESS you can specifically tell them the date you told them they were making you uncomfortable. In those words. This man's punishment was to write me a fake apology letter \"sorry you were offended\" after following me and other women around the office and whispering to us how \"good\" we looked from behind, among other things. Boundaries are important, and I'm glad you realize that now. Lots of great books, YT videos and podcasts about creating boundaries.", "NTA, no means no!", "You already expressed your discomfort multiple times. NTA", "\"A hasn\u2019t spoken to me since.\"\n\nA WIN. NTA", "You told him on multiple occasions you were not interested in him - and he continued insisting. This constitutes workplace harassment behavior, and the correct approach is to report to HR. Which you did.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I was in almost exactly this position once and I desperately wish I had done what you did and gone to a supervisor, instead of trying to handle it myself. It literally went on for MONTHS of me getting more and more uncomfortable and angry while he played dumb and pretended he was confused by me sending \u201cmixed signals\u201d because I was polite to him.", "NTA. You've had to lie and say you were already in a relationship. That alone is enough to deter anyone normal from trying to express interest. You have never confirmed any invitation and rejected every advance he's made. Firmly. If he still doesn't get the message, it's just right that HR gets involved because as the others said, he's creating a hostile working environment for you.", "NTA\n\nYou told him twice that you\u2019re not interested in him romantically. That is one more time than you should have needed to to.\n\nAnyone who thinks that being polite is \u201cleading him on\u201d is an idiot and you should ignore them. \n\nNo means no.", "NTA - you said no that is all that you need to do. He is creepy and he should be dealt with by HR", "You said no. Repeatedly. One no should be enough. But - read the room better. There was a reason others thought the guy was a creep. Now you know why. NTA.", "NTA\nA won't accept a no and he is TA for that, that is why he has no friends.\n\nBut I almost went with esh because you clearly knew A was in to you and you could have acted colder with him, I mean you didn't needed to befriend him. I know it can be hard to some people because they feel that's mean but trust me it's safer. That being said a NO is enough and that's the only thing you needed to say for him to back off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At work, I\u2019ve received messages from other coworkers that A is staring at me, and asking me if I don\u2019t feel his stares. He will also just walk over to your station and just stare at whatever you\u2019re doing on your computer. (we have cubicles) Id say he\u2019s also kinda misunderstood, in terms of the things he says. This could come off as weird to others, but personally it doesn\u2019t bother me. I picked up on this in my conversations with him as well. He actually told me once I was the only person here who made him feel \u201cheard\u201d. I guess indicating nobody else really listens/talks to him. Honestly I can see how his behaviour overall can come off as odd.\n\nBefore I came: After everything, my closest coworker and I were speaking about the incident and she basically told me since he came nobody really liked him. Without getting into too much detail (identification purposes), let\u2019s just say he stole something from a coworker and didn\u2019t apologise for it.
