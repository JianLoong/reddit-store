I am one of them.\nMy young brothers go 2-3 days without baths, itching and everything. Absolutely awful to see. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s been a day or 2 after one of their last showers. They\u2019ll have to fight to convince my mom to let them shower and my mom will get furious with them, telling them they\u2019re f*gs for wanting to bathe so much, or telling them they had all day (they go to school) or that is too late. Mind you my mom keeps all rags, towels, and basically any clothes of theirs in the garage in bags so you couldn\u2019t really shower anyway if you wanted to without going to her. Compared to my dad, he has a bath every single night no questions asked. He works as a plumber and it can be a pretty hard job but even when he doesn\u2019t work it is always made sure he gets a bath before us. Lately water system has only been suitable for one shower at a time so this as been more enforced. If my brother A (13) hasn\u2019t been able to  shower in 4 days, he has to wait until either dad is done (he bathes late) or until the next day.\n\nAnother thing is sometimes (at least 2-3 times a week or more) my parents will cook steaks for themselves and nothing for us. Any food we might have any interest in eating like goldfish or certain cereals are locked in the garage and we are not allowed to cook so we have to scavenge in our ingredient based pantry.\n\nMy mom is always complaining about us, how we have spirits, and how we tempt her and dad into getting angry and how they\u2019re not going to hell for us. She always complains to dad about us after he get off.\nThere are so many more problems but when I was arguing with my mom she got upset at me and told me that my dad works hard and that the Bible says she has to put him first anyways. I said I agreed but we as her children need to be prioritized a little more, especially considering how we didn\u2019t even choose to be here. She got mad and stormed off.

Everyone who works or volunteers for my church is taught to report this crap. OP is so NTA and I hope and pray they can all get the hell out of that house.", "Unfortunately I'd say this is a pretty common style of abusive christianity that's seen all the time. NTA op hope you call cps and get the help you and your siblings need!", "Came here to say that: Little kids shouldn\u2019t bath or shower everyday but that\u2019s not the issue here: These kids are neglected and most likely abused. She needs to find an adult like a teacher who can help to get her in touch with CPS.\n\nNTA", "I'm.downvoting you just for saying you'll get down voted for this", "NTA. Here everyone is focusing on a shower/bath and 2-3 times a week the kids have to forage for food coz momma cooks her and husband steaks and nothing for the kids.", "If you and your siblings go to public school, tell their schools too.  At least you can get fed at school while CPS looks into everything.", "Please tell someone what's going on. You and your siblings should not have to deal with this abuse", "LoL", "You are being neglected and abused. Find a teacher ot somebody else you trust and talk to them about who can help. Make sure you can recount what happens precisely to show the severity of your situation.\n\nDo not go to somebody from your church. The risk much go high that they just rat you out to your parents instead of helping you.", ">\tI guess but then why have 7 children!? Your mom is insane \n\nBecause religion.", "Well he eats food in front of them while they go hungry, so the answer to that is 1,000% no.", "He\u2018s also a plumber and their shower doesn\u2019t work properly. The dad is as bad as the mother.", "Sorry to say but your mum appears to have some form of religion based psychosis. NTA.", "NTA, call CPS. She's using religion as a shield for abuse and neglect. The Bible doesn't tell parents to neglect their children and actively discourages neglect and abuse. And the fact that your dad is okay with all of this is awful, he's just as bad as your mom. If you can't call cps tell a teacher or a cop or another trusted adult", "You had me at seven children. NTA, but your mother is", "I do believe in \u201cputting my husband first\u201d but neither of us would ever see our kids go without so it\u2019s irrelevant. What this woman is doing isn\u2019t a problem with prioritizing it\u2019s a matter of neglect and cruelty. Who locks up clothes and food?!", "I agree this is horrible, but you don\u2019t necessarily need to shower more on your period.  If you get super bloody sure and if it helps with cramps or makes you feel better or something, go for it.  But there is a stigma around menstruation that it makes women \u201cunclean\u201d and it\u2019s not true - plenty of women have periods without a lot of mess, whether by low flow or using something like a diva cup (and getting good at dealing with it - the first time you may look like you have just axe murdered someone).\n\nNone of which is relevant to this post, but I don\u2019t want any young women out there feeling like they are doing something wrong if they don\u2019t shower extra on their periods.", "The mother doesn\u2019t allow them to bathe for 2-3 days which you find normal and she cooks for her husband and doesn\u2019t give them anything to eat. She locks up the cereals and food so they have to ask and your saying ESH? \n\nI don\u2019t see where and how  OP sucks.", "Just you and OP's parents suck here, MORON"]}
