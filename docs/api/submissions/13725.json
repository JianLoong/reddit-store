Did you take a knife and slash her leg?  How can people be mad at you for the wound on her leg.     \n\nNTA.    The stealing is STEALING.   It's unacceptable.   She should get disciplined for stealing.\n\nHow would she know to look on the top shelf of your closet - does she rifled through all your drawers?    Your uncle is an enabling jerk.", "NTA. How did your cousin know the stuff was on top of the shelf?\nThe dad is TA.\n\nAlso RFI: broken bones??? Wouldn\u2019t the first reflex be to go to the hospital instead of giving the accessories?", "NTA.  How is this your fault exactly?  Did you kick the chair?", "NTA- If her dad allows her to steal from his own family, and gets angry at you when she steals and gets hurt doing so, there are bigger issues here.  Also if other family members also supported her stealing from you, then you need to speak to your parents about this and not wanting them over any longer.", "Nta, she shouldn\u2019t have been trying to steal and you\u2019ve all been tolerating it for too long. Maybe this will be a lesson for her", "NTA. Your cousin is far too old to be stealing your stuff. She's not a toddler any more; she's aware of what she's doing, and is simply acting entitled because she's never had to face consequences for her bad behaviour. Your dad was in the wrong. Those were \\*your\\* accessories. Whether you wanted to keep them for yourself, or give them to a friend, your cousin had no right to take them! The fact you need to put things high out of reach from your thieving cousin is not YOUR fault. It's your cousin's fault she got hurt, and also maybe your older relatives' fault she got hurt. If they'd taught her it's wrong to steal, then this wouldn't have been an issue.", "NTA\n\nWTF, who in their right mind sides with a thief??? She had less than zero business even being in your room and its entirely her own fault for being a little brat with kleptomania", "NTA. You're allowed to keep things in your room, that's kinda the point of it being your room.\n\nIt's not your fault that your cousin went into your room without permission and injured herself attempting to steal from you.\n\nI'm sorry that a child got hurt, but they have no one to blame but themselves. Her father is doing her no favours in the long run by enabling her behaviour.\n\nHopefully, this incident serves as a lesson to the kid.", "she\u2019s fucking 13, she\u2019s grown now. where are HER parents and why aren\u2019t they teaching her not to steal. Enabling this behaviour is disgusting. and OP you need to stop thinking you gave her the scar.. you did nothing. SHE tried to invade your privacy and steal so she got punished. your dad needs a reality check and a reminder about who his priorities lie with.", "ask your parents to put a lock on your room when others come so no one can go in there.  you are nta. that title goes to uncle and cousin", "WTF is wrong with your family defending a kleptomaniac. No wonder your cousin steals. She wasn\u2019t thought the importance of other people\u2019s possessions. This should be a lesson for her.\n\nYou protected your property which you had every right to. NTA. Your Dad and the rest of your family that placed some guilt on you is TA.", "NTA\n\nShe chose to be a thief. How can she blame you when she got injured from trying to stealing?   \n\n\nYou are the victim. And her dad is enabling her thieving ways at this age.", "Very strong NTA where are your parents. They should have defended you . Its their job to protect and provide a save place for you to live", "NTA. One day your cousin will steal from the wrong person and get more than a scratch OR she will end up in prison. I would not have allowed her to take a gift and your parents need to allow a lock on your door so she can\u2019t get your things.", "NTA\n\nNext time they come over, lock the door and put a sign up, \"No Thieves Allowed\" then you can't be blamed for her injuring herself trying to break in.", "Strong Nta \n\nLet that be a lesson to the little brat", "Info because I\u2019m curious. Did you get back the accessories that your uncle stole to give your klepto cousin?", "What is wrong with your family? You're NTA for putting your stuff on a shelf but YTA for not telling your cousin that stealing is wrong.", "NTA you didn't trip her. She tried to get around the safeguard you put in place (putting the items on a high shelf) and this was a natural consequence. I'm sorry she got hurt, but it's better than eventually going to jail if she doesn't learn to not steal.", "What the actual fuck, she was trying to steal your things and they're mad at YOU? NTA. Get a lock for your door.", "NTA. It's great (for your extended family) that you've ignored her thievery thus far, but you are absolutely allowed to want to keep your things safe from being stolen. Merely having your stuffy be in your bedroom should be enough for it to be safe from family and friends. You shouldn't have to put it on the highest shelf. But you're allowed to, they're your shelves.\n\nDespite the indulgence from her parents, you are the victim here. It was your stuff she was getting into, without permission.\n\nIf you left the chair on the table, left your bedroom door open, taunted her about putting stuff out of her reach, or watched her go into your room without telling her not to, then you are a little bit TA. But she's still the one who decided to access such a high shelf without asking anyone for help. She knew she shouldn't be doing what she was doing, but I think she also expected that the consequences of being caught would be nearly non-existent.", "WTF? NTA. Your cousin is damn well old enough to know not to steal and her parents are worse for letting it continue", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Your little cousin HURT HERSELF WHILE TRYING TO STEAL.**\n\nYour relatives are AHs, YOU are the victim here. ALL YOU did was trying to keep your cousin from stealing your stuff.\n\nYou should demand to get a lock and not have her enter your room any more.", "NTA. So you put something out of reach and a teen, who should know better, went into a place she wasn't allowed and had an accident trying to take something that didn't belong to get? You didn't do anything in this situation and your uncle is trying to deflect from the fact that he's a shitty parent.\n\nHonestly people keep bringing it up. I would turn the narrative into. Your uncle is neglectful and bad parent, why wasn't he watching her to ensure she wasn't getting into trouble?", "You didn't wound your cousin.\n\nShe wounded herself while trying to steal from you.\n\nYour household is totally upside down. \n\nNTA.", "The only way you could be YTA is for enabling that behaviour for so long, stealing isn't cute when you have to hide your belongings.", "Probably broke some bones? I don\u2019t buy it. Sus post.", "ESH. You know she steals, but you let her in your room unattended, and your family gets dramatic over a small wound. A scar on her ankle?

But when you buy a gift for someone else and the only idea you got is to put in high on a shelf rather that to confront the matter, there is already a problem here. \nA problem that would grow bigger when she'll become a teenager interested in more expensive stuff.

How about when she is arrested for shoplifting..    he needs to stop being an AH and teach her this is wrong.", "Because I didn\u2019t mind it at first.

Well not sure that after that incident she'll try anything in your room again, but if it happens, talk to her, like : I always knews that you were stealing, and if you would have asked me for most of the things I would have offered them as gift for you. I didn't want to make a fuss out of it, but now that you tried to get things that I purposely put out of your reach, and that you continue to steal, I want you to know that I am aware, I see your behaviour, and it cannot continue without consequences. \nAnd state the consequences on your sides.", "i agree with this person its best to prevent further behaviour like this so she doesnt keep stealing goodluck op"]}
