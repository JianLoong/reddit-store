My wife and I have a single daughter. My daughter has a 2 years old son. Last week she was at our house. She was talking with her mom.

( no idea why would she even ask this). My daughter said yes. Then my wife went on a little lecture about how this is not healthy and you should always love the spouse the most because children when they grew up , they will leave and have their own family while you spend the remaining of your life with your spouse ( again , even if she believes this, what's the point of telling this to our daughter??). Then she said \" and your father also agrees with my view\". Here, I intervened and said don't bring me into this, I never said I agreed with this. Here my daughter laughed and hugged me. \n\nAt night, my wife said why would I embarrass her like this in front of our daughter?

Your wife put you in a bad position. I wouldn't get involved either.", "NOPE, NTA at all.  Your wife is the AH here, and good for you for being a good dad to your daughter.", "NTA - The love you feel for your child vs the love you feel for your spouse are very different kind of love, not sure why your wife thinks they should be compared?? Kinda gross actually. And even if they were to be compared your wife is just wrong. Your children should always be your number one priority. You created them and even into adulthood you bear responsibility for their well being and how they \"turned out\".", "NTA \n\nYour wife's first mistake was to project her opinion as truth for all and thinking that anything else is wrong.\n\nHer second mistake was speaking for you and assuming you share her opinion.\n\nApparently her opinion is so correct that disagreeing is disrespectful, and she was called out that not everyone agrees with her. She was embarrassed because of self importance.\n\nShe needs to get a grip on herself.", "NTA. You never told her you agreed with her. She just assumed", "NTA you're allowed to have your own opinions.", "NTA. If she speaks for you on a controversial topic, she should have made sure, you are fine with it. Also, inhowfar is it embarrassing to have another opinion in front of your daughter? It's family and also one person (vs in front of a big crowd), so she should just relax. \n\nBtw, the topic itself is not necessary. Love is not limited and also not comparable.", "NTA. What about that was embarrassing to her?  Your daughter laughed. Likely at her mom\u2019s silliness and then basically thanked you for having her back. It seemed like a lighthearted situation of \u201coh mom is being mom again!\u201d  Your daughter probably never took the conversation as a serious one, and neither did you.  Your wife\u2019s embarrassment is hers and hers alone.", "NTA. not only did your wife try to get you to gang up on your daughter with her, she also lied and was trying to make your daughter think that you had feelings you didn\u2019t have.", "NTA. The way I explain it is that it\u2019s a different kind but equal amount of love. No matter what, I will always love my children. Sure, there are things they could do that would make loving them extremely painful but nothing could completely eradicate the love. My husband on the other hand, there are definitely things that he could do that would simply erase all of the love I feel for him instantly. I suppose it\u2019s the difference between conditional and unconditional love really.", "NTA. Side note- I used to think like your wife but then my husband left me for another woman.", "NTA at all! It\u2019s not like you broke down why you disagreed in front of your daughter and called your wife a fool for her viewpoint. I can see how that might\u2019ve been embarrassing for her. But you simply said you disagreed so you did nothing wrong.", "NTA - she can't speak for you and then complain when you correct her.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife decided to jump feet first into a condescending lecture to your daughter \n\nShe can remove her own foot from her mouth.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Not your fault she assumed you would agree with her. You told her to leave you out of it.", "NTA. She shouldn't speak for you. And in my opinion, it is a different kind of love.", "NTA. She embarassed herself.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t even understand why it\u2019s a competition / comparison!\n\nYou can love two people in different ways. \n\nYou love a kid unconditionally to a point! You love a partner unconditionally to a point!\n\nThese \u201cpoints\u201d are all different and change depending on \u201cother points\u201d\n\nNothing is black and white. \n\nPlus a parent will always be the parent to a kid not matter the age!", "NTA. Your wife had no business stating your view on the matter agreed with her own. She should\u2019ve let you speak for yourself..", "NTA- a parent should naturally love their children the most even more than their spouse. I understand your wife's logic but it is messed up that she gave you an opinion you didn't have and told your daughter that", "NTA. First it is totally valid to love your daughter above your wife. Second, why would your wife even bring that up in front of your daughter? I am not saying every parent has to love their child more than their spouse, but to bring it up in such a flippant manner with your child could have the potential to leave them feeling devastated. That was a difficult situation that your wife just sprung on you out of nowhere.", "NTA. But your wife might benefit from reading about the 8 types of love identified by the ancient Greeks. Love for a child and love for a spouse are different so you can't compare.", "NTA. Who tells their child they're not the most important thing in the world??? I don't care how old your children are they should be your priority unless there's some issues. They're your offspring who you saw grow over the years into an adult. They're still your baby. They're the ones that will care for you when you get older. They're the ones who will be there for you when your spouse passes. Partners fall out of love all the time. This person seems jealous that her husband loves his child. Who gets jealous over that??", "NTA and your wife sounds potentially a little toxic. This isn't normal/healthy parenting behaviour. Could just be one red flag that ends up meaning nothing, but take this chance to examine her beliefs and actions a little closer.", "NTA. My love for my kids is unconditional but my husband it is conditional.", "Wtf is wrong with your wife? Who loves their spouse more than their own children? \n\nShe should\u2019ve been embarrassed because what she said to your daughter was incredibly hurtful. You handled this perfectly.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife's view of it is a bit odd. Either way they're two different kinds of love.", "NTA - that's a super old fashioned idea. My personal theory was that it stems from women historically not being able to do anything without a husband coupled with the prevalence of children dying frequently. But now it's just wackadoo.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife has an awful hobby. That's just not necessary or nice.", "I swear I\u2019ve read this exact thing somewhere, so she\u2019s not the only one who thinks like this.\n\nI get it to an extent, a lot of peoples relationships fall apart after children. Usually because someone is selfish and doesn\u2019t understand that they now have someone who they should love more than anything, but they still want to be the only one getting attention and live their child free selfish days the same as before.", "NTA Never ask a question if you can't handle the answer!", "NTA... here is why:  \n\n\nYou picked your wife and love her. That love is amazing, but...  \nyou and your wife created your daughter together, you were the first people she ever knew and that love is way more than the love for your wife. You are the first male she ever loved. Like most daughters she probably loves you more than anyone on the planet...Unconditional love, maybe your wife should look it up.  \n\n\nA parents love for their child should have no limit, nothing should ever eclipse it. As a parent of several children, my other half knows damn well I love my kids more =-)", "NTA.  I never understood people who say things like this.  The love is different.  and it\u2019s not a freaking competition.  I love my children more than anything.  I also love my partner more than anything.  For crying out loud, it\u2019s not a mutually exclusive thing.  It\u2019s not middle school where we fight over who is \u201cmore\u201d the best friend.  Your wife needs to grow up.", "NAH\n\nDifferent people have different opinions about this. It is okay for your daughter to say that she loves her son the most and it is okay for your wife to say she loves her spouse the most. But your wife probably shouldn't have brought you into the conversation like that, especially if you two have different views on the matter.", "What about when spouse leaves for a younger man or woman?", "NAH, if you dont agree with it you should have kept your opinion.", "Only in this instance to your wife you are haha. But most of us will agree you're NTA. Though I can kind of understand what she was trying to get at, it is still your choice to agree with her or not about that situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Two different things.", "NTA. Love how she basically told her own daughter that she loves her less than her husband.", "NTA, but I can tell by your daughter\u2019s reaction that you\u2019ve been nothing but a great father. Your wife may feel embarrassed, but her assuming you agreed with her logic because it meant that you loved her the most in the world is also very telling of the husband you\u2019ve been. You just seem like a stand-up guy, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a fantastic grandfather. Best of wishes to you", "NTA.", "I could not agree more. Love isn't a fucking competition. You can love your parents, kids, siblings and spouse the same amount. Who you prioritize depends on who needs it most in that moment.", "Yeah ngl the lecture from the wife gave me a big icky. Like why are you trying to make it into a competition?", "I disagree.

So it's good that he corrected her. NTA", "So that should go for the wife too shouldnt it?", "Yeah. It gave me weird vibes. I don\u2019t have kids but I can\u2019t imagine loving a partner more than my own child. Besides I think she\u2019s got it backwards Partners come and go that child is always your child.", "I will never understand this thought process were a partner comes before a child. My son is part of me and I know his dad feels the same even if we were still together he would never come before my son in away what's so ever. My son's my world, I raised, loved and made him the amazing young man he is today. When they say a child leaves when they get a partner yes they do to add to your family but plenty of partners walk away or cheat and never come back but the kids always there with there love", "No NTA she shouldn't speak for you", "My mother is like your wife. I don\u2019t talk to her."]}
