I have days off upcoming and my parents and my brother are pressuring me to go and visit him during that time. I don't want to go and that's the issue.\n\nI'm a nurse. In the last three years I can count the number of times I have had two days in a row off on my hands. My hospital is in an area that's been hit hard and everyone has been working non-stop. Having only one or two days off at a time has been difficult but everyone has done what they needed to do and this was not avoidable. Now it has changed and I have an entire week off coming up.\n\nI don't have any plans besides sleeping and relaxing at home. I do not want to go anywhere, do anything or be around anyone. I have been looking forward to this time for months. It's been a rough go and I need this.\n\nThe issue is that the same week I am off work my parents are taking a trip so they can visit my brother in prison. They will be going for seven days and six nights and will be staying in hotel. They have gone to visit at other times, this is not the first time. However they are going for a week so they may visit him on multiple days over the week. The dates of my days off were not chosen by me. It was based on scheduling and worked around the days off of others. This was fine by me as I had no plans. My parents had planned their trip at the same time as I was getting my time off.\n\nMy parents and my brother want me to come with them. I don't want to. The prison is on the other side of the country (literally on the opposite coast). It would be three hours by driving. It would be either a three and half hour trip or a four hour trip by train depending on whether it was direct or had a stopover. I do not want to travel so far on my days off. Even if I didn't spend the whole week there like my parents are, it is still a far way to go.\n\nI do not ignore my brother. We speak often. I have said I will go visit him at another time, and whenever my work schedule allows. But I get limited time off and he is so far away. You have no idea how much I have been looking forward to my upcoming week off. To have seven days to do nothing but sleep and relax feels like a dream. With how things are at the hospital I am so tired all the time. Both of my parents have evenings, weekends and holidays off, plus days off and they only work standard hours and no more. It is easier for them to take days off than it is for me. I don\u2019t know if they are forgetting that or they are just thinking that visiting my brother is more important than getting to rest.\n\nDo you think I\u2019m the asshole because I want to spend my days off at home relaxing instead of going to visit my brother in prison on the other side of the country? My parents and my brother are really angry at me over my refusal to go.", "created_utc": 1678841128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rglbm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_visit_my_brother_in/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told him you would see him another time and you communicate with him regularly. That is more than enough. You are not in prison. He is.

Further, many prisons require inmates to submit a visitor list, well in advance of visits, because they do background checks. For example no ex inmates are allowed on prison property.  Pretty standard stuff. So without prior arrangements, I\u2019m not sure you would even get to see him. Depends what country you are in and whether he is in federal or county jail.

In my state, it takes 5 hours to drive from my current home to my hometown. This is just 1 state, and it is not the largest. \n\nEnjoy your week off. It may actually be the best timing with your family out of town, so no one to bother you.", "Can confirm. I live 4 hours from my family in the same state and we aren't even on opposite ends. I go to see them about once a month or once every 6 weeks.", "Four hours there and four hours back, and you don't even have to drive yourself?  You can sit and read or play on your phone the entire ride?  Can you visit him on one day and then take the rest of the week for yourself?", "NTA\n\nBut I cannot stop rolling my eyes that you think an 7- 8 hour round trip is so far. \n\nThat is an easy overnight and a slightly rough day trip.\n\nYou could easily do this in one day\n\n3.5 hours away is living close to family.\n\nBut NTA for not wanting to go visit him in prison", "NTA. You obviously need and deserve time off. And from a practical sense, isn't it a waste for everyone to visit him at the same time? He could have one person visit a week for a month or have them all at once. If it were me, I'd rather space visits out. But that doesn't matter because you need and deserve time off.", "NTA  Stay home and sleep.  And NO is a complete sentence.", "You need your rest. If you can make since it is only a 3 hour drive just go see him on one of those days and rent your own hotel room. Visit him for a few hours and just go relax in the room.then the next day drive back.", "NTA\nMy brother was two years in prison for drug dealing as well over ten years ago. As much as I loved him I was only there once to visit him. I couldn't handle it to go in there we spoke on the phone daily. \nI never was made to feel bad about it from him or our parents because it wasn't my fault he was in there. It was his own wrong doing and he had to live with me not wanting to go into a prison even if it was just to visit him. We still have a very good relationship and he got back on the right path because of how it affected my parents and me and he didn't want to hurt us again.", "NTA. If your parents are so concerned about your brother, they can also show some care and concern for you after going through three years of hell.\n\nYour brother can deal with the fact that his being in prison is not the center of your existence. You're talking to him and plan to visit. Nobody should be giving you a hard time.", "NTA in any way.

You deserve a week free from stress and drama.", "A Redditor once said something that really made an impression on me.

But I get limited time off and he is so far away.\n\nYou don't really seem to be planning on going to visit him, which again, is fine. But you shouldn't give him an I'll visit sometime, when I have time off work platitude when you have time off work and are not visiting him. You are busy, visiting your brother in jail isn't something you really want to do and that's fine.", "I just skimmed through Irish prisons and visiting hours. Most prisoners have a limit on the number of visits per week. Unless he is a remand prisoner, which might get 15 minutes per visiting day, they get one 30 minute a week. You have to book the visit ahead of time. \n\nCloverhill is 4 - 30 minutes a week visits. Wheatfield and Limerick are 2 - 30 minutes week. Shelton Abbey only lets visitors in on Weekends and Bank holidays. \n\nUnless he is in Loughan House which seems to have different visiting hours. I don't see a limit there. \n\nhttps://www.irishprisons.ie/prison/\n\nIf he's not in Loughan House, this is a complete waste of your time to drive three hours and spend a week there, trying to get in.

Take an extra bubble bath for me!", "NTA, and quite frankly, you don't even need to go into detail about why you don't want to go, because saying \"no, I don't want to,\" is a complete answer. \n\nOn the other side of that, you are clearly in need of some quality rest and self care time, so make a loose plan for yourself and all of the things you want to enjoy, and have a fantastic week off :)", "NTA. No is a full answer.", "NTA. You need to rest. Don't feel guilty for putting your foot down and taking this much deserved break. Your job is mentally and physically taxing. Get some rest.", "NTA\nThat much travel in a short timeframe would be not so much of a vacation, and healthcare workers lately of all people need a  vacation\n\nEspecially if he deserves to be locked up (rather than something like false conviction, but even if so, you'd be burned out)", "NTA. You're a nurse. Covid is still running rampant in prisons. You don't need to chance that.", "Hey, op. I was a foster mom a long time ago and one of my foster sons is in federal prison for probably the rest of his life. We are very close like mother and son, no foster. We talk a couple times a week and I send him photos but it's a hard trip to go and see him and my health isn't great so I haven't in about 4 years. But I don't feel guilty. It's what I can do. Sounds like you've been under awful strain and really physically and for your mental well-being need some down time, like multiple days at a time down time. Some stress cannot be gotten rid of in 1 day off We can't always please everyone. But just this once you can please yourself. NTA.", "I like the idea of OP sending something. Especially like a book where it won\u2019t take a ton of time, but will have some good meaning to the brother. That way he knows OP is thinking about him and OP can take her much deserved break.", "Plus, this way his visitors will be spaced out, not coming all at once. More net family time for him!", "hahaha!", "Or he\u2019s in prison for his political beliefs. \n\nJust trying to think of reasons being in jail could not be his fault", "It\u2019s an American thing. The federal government has their own judicial system and each states has its own judicial system. It depends on whether you commit a crime against the state or the federal government which determines which system you\u2019re in. Then each county in the state also has their system for county level crimes.", "Seconding this. Unless he\u2019s in prison for his political beliefs or something, he didn\u2019t think too much about his relationship with you or care about it enough to stay out of prison.", "I was wondering how you got the other side of the country in a few hours of driving. Not American answers that.", "NTA. Your parents are asking you to set yourself on fire to keep them and your brother warm. \n\nI know many people have this idea that being a nurse is easy and maybe that\u2019s what your parents are thinking. Maybe they think that because you\u2019re not a doctor that you don\u2019t have your patients lives in your hands. Or that because you\u2019re a woman you have a responsibility to be nice and cheer up your brother. \n\nWhatever the reason, they aren\u2019t going to understand your need to have time to sleep in and take care of yourself. \n\nYour brother, however, made adult decisions that require him to be locked up. It is not your responsibility to make his life easier. He forfeited that right by being an irresponsible citizen. \n\nTaking care of yourself IS your responsibility. Not only are you being a productive member of society but in order to continue to do so you need to recharge and rest. Your health, your job, and your patients lives depend on it. \n\nSo tell your parents and your brother to pound sand. They aren\u2019t paying for your trip, and it\u2019s a huge ask to make someone pay for a trip and dictate their actions on their free time. It\u2019s very unreasonable.", "NTA but assuming you have your own car you do have the option to do a day trip upto him and visit if you can. You don't need to invest your week into it.\n\nMost important keep doing what you are doing. Health care burnout for nurses sucks.", "Nta. DO NOT go. You need that time off for your mental health and to prevent burnout. You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup. You deserve rest at home if you want.", "NTA because you need the rest and what you do with your vacation time is no one's business but your own. \n\nBut the driving distance to me isn't that great of a reason. 3 hours is not that far.", "NTA, you absolutely need and deserve to take time to yourself to recharge", "Nta it's your time off.

Enjoy it.", "NAH, it's understandable he wants to see you, and might feel a bit hurt that you aren't coming this time when you \"could\".

You're both in hard situations, and this time the needs of those situations aren't compatible", "You sound less like you're having a holiday and more like you're recovering from multiple gruelling years of living on the edge of burnout.\n\nIt's great that they want you there, and I'm sure you would go if you were up for it, but now is not a good time and as the poster above said - he's not going anywhere.

I\u2019m a firm believer that sometimes you just have to hurt some feelings to establish boundaries. Honestly, let them be mad. I know it\u2019s easy to say and hard to live through but how does it really affect you if they are upset? None of them are going to cut you off, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nI suspect that you don\u2019t usually tell them no? I could be wrong but their collective tantrums are telling me otherwise.

You have worked your shift in what everybody knows is one of the most demanding jobs nowadays just to get off and have to summon more energy to get your things together. Then u gotta summon even more to make the trip. I'm sure your parents would need even more of the energy that you ran out of at work to chat or catch up or have dinner or something. Then you have to almost be a robot to go to the visit where you can't even think straight enough to have a decent conversation. Meanwhile like u said your parents get time to rest and the most energy your brother has to use during all of that is the time it takes to walk from his cell to the visiting area.

I mean, not to be mean but jfc. Who WOULD choose that?? I get it's her brother, family and all. But my god, write a letter, (which many incarcerated people like as much or more than visits, bc letters can hold more info/catching up/etc than a visit, and can be read over and over when feeling lonely or needing an encouraging word / friendly voice). Or put money on their commisary for treats. Or do a Zoom visit! Or even a phone call-- ITS PRISON, they are GLAD for ANY break in the monotony lmao and prison visits are.....grim AF. And it's just talking on a phone behind glass, or even a zoom call where you're in the lobby, prisoner is in his cell. \n\n I know, I have worked with prison populations closely in multiple jobs. Like, I bet brother would be  overjoyed if his sister put $50 on his account, and/or  wrote a bunch of long letters just talking about nothing and everything, then mailed one a day or every other day, or even weekly- mail call is a way to alleviate boredom, remember life and loved ones outside, keep up to date on current happenings with friends and family, and most of all, shows they are still thought about (you often feel separate from the world, forgotten and moved past while in prisons) and cared about even tho they \"fucked up\" (a surprising insecurity most prisoners worry about- that no one will still love them bc they \"are horrible/failure/embarrassment/etc)\n\n No reason for sister to have to go in the world's grimmest, most depressing/boring vacay with her only week off in half a decade lmao\n\n\n(Also, was anyone else surprised as I was at the conclusion of her talking about the distance? Lol  she said the prison is on the opposite coast and is  a \"long trip\"- so I'm thinking, ok, east coast to west or vice versa, yeah, at least a 12 hr flight, don't blame her---- wait, what? 3 hours? THREE? and they are going for a week instead of driving or whatever? Like, I commute 3 hrs EACH DAY- if I drove 3 hours one way, I'd end up in another very small podunk mountain town not even near state lines, let alone the opposite coast! \ud83d\ude02 this is just so comical to me as an American, which I guess OP is not.
