I have days off upcoming and my parents and my brother are pressuring me to go and visit him during that time. I don't want to go and that's the issue.\n\nI'm a nurse. In the last three years I can count the number of times I have had two days in a row off on my hands. My hospital is in an area that's been hit hard and everyone has been working non-stop. Having only one or two days off at a time has been difficult but everyone has done what they needed to do and this was not avoidable. Now it has changed and I have an entire week off coming up.\n\nI don't have any plans besides sleeping and relaxing at home. I do not want to go anywhere, do anything or be around anyone. I have been looking forward to this time for months. It's been a rough go and I need this.\n\nThe issue is that the same week I am off work my parents are taking a trip so they can visit my brother in prison. They will be going for seven days and six nights and will be staying in hotel. They have gone to visit at other times, this is not the first time. However they are going for a week so they may visit him on multiple days over the week. The dates of my days off were not chosen by me. It was based on scheduling and worked around the days off of others. This was fine by me as I had no plans. My parents had planned their trip at the same time as I was getting my time off.\n\nMy parents and my brother want me to come with them. I don't want to. The prison is on the other side of the country (literally on the opposite coast). It would be three hours by driving. It would be either a three and half hour trip or a four hour trip by train depending on whether it was direct or had a stopover. I do not want to travel so far on my days off. Even if I didn't spend the whole week there like my parents are, it is still a far way to go.\n\nI do not ignore my brother. We speak often. I have said I will go visit him at another time, and whenever my work schedule allows. But I get limited time off and he is so far away. You have no idea how much I have been looking forward to my upcoming week off. To have seven days to do nothing but sleep and relax feels like a dream. With how things are at the hospital I am so tired all the time. Both of my parents have evenings, weekends and holidays off, plus days off and they only work standard hours and no more. It is easier for them to take days off than it is for me. I don\u2019t know if they are forgetting that or they are just thinking that visiting my brother is more important than getting to rest.\n\nDo you think I\u2019m the asshole because I want to spend my days off at home relaxing instead of going to visit my brother in prison on the other side of the country? My parents and my brother are really angry at me over my refusal to go.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If that's not an option, write him a letter, send him a book to read or some (approved) drawing materials or something to pass the time.

Prisons are pretty bare and not supposed to be fun, but inmates have an account that relatives and friends put money into to use for those things. Ask your brother when he calls and he will give you the information or give your parents the money to deposit when they see him. You don\u2019t have to give him a lot, but the more money he has in his account, the easier his time inside will be. Yes he is in prison because of his own actions with drugs, but he is in with murderers and rapists and that is a hard life. He will probably be happier with the money than seeing you, especially if you can afford it, and it will show your parents you care about him.\n\nEdit. I see you are in Ireland but I imagine Irish prisons are like American ones where the prisoners have a commissary account. And since you would have to spend money for the hotel and food for the week anyway, the money could be put to better use.

And prisoners usually get one or two half hour visits per week. Prisoners can make special requests for an extra visit but that depends on his behaviour while incarcerated. Further, many prisons require inmates to submit a visitor list, well in advance of visits, because they do background checks. For example no ex inmates are allowed on prison property.  Pretty standard stuff. So without prior arrangements, I\u2019m not sure you would even get to see him. Depends what country you are in and whether he is in federal or county jail. Personally I would fund out all this be having him phone you. Prisoners can write letters and make several phone calls per week. Talk to your brother on the phone.

I was a foster mom a long time ago and one of my foster sons is in federal prison for probably the rest of his life. We are very close like mother and son, no foster. We talk a couple times a week and I send him photos but it's a hard trip to go and see him and my health isn't great so I haven't in about 4 years. But I don't feel guilty. It's what I can do. Sounds like you've been under awful strain and really physically and for your mental well-being need some down time, like multiple days at a time down time. Some stress cannot be gotten rid of in 1 day off We can't always please everyone. But just this once you can please yourself. NTA.", "I like the idea of OP sending something.

More net family time for him!", "hahaha!", "Or he\u2019s in prison for his political beliefs. \n\nJust trying to think of reasons being in jail could not be his fault", "It\u2019s an American thing. The federal government has their own judicial system and each states has its own judicial system. It depends on whether you commit a crime against the state or the federal government which determines which system you\u2019re in. Then each county in the state also has their system for county level crimes.", "Seconding this.

Your parents are asking you to set yourself on fire to keep them and your brother warm. \n\nI know many people have this idea that being a nurse is easy and maybe that\u2019s what your parents are thinking.

Or that because you\u2019re a woman you have a responsibility to be nice and cheer up your brother. \n\nWhatever the reason, they aren\u2019t going to understand your need to have time to sleep in and take care of yourself. \n\nYour brother, however, made adult decisions that require him to be locked up. It is not your responsibility to make his life easier. He forfeited that right by being an irresponsible citizen. \n\nTaking care of yourself IS your responsibility. Not only are you being a productive member of society but in order to continue to do so you need to recharge and rest. Your health, your job, and your patients lives depend on it. \n\nSo tell your parents and your brother to pound sand.

I know it\u2019s easy to say and hard to live through but how does it really affect you if they are upset? None of them are going to cut you off, that\u2019s for sure. \n\nI suspect that you don\u2019t usually tell them no? I could be wrong but their collective tantrums are telling me otherwise.

You have worked your shift in what everybody knows is one of the most demanding jobs nowadays just to get off and have to summon more energy to get your things together. Then u gotta summon even more to make the trip. I'm sure your parents would need even more of the energy that you ran out of at work to chat or catch up or have dinner or something. Then you have to almost be a robot to go to the visit where you can't even think straight enough to have a decent conversation. Meanwhile like u said your parents get time to rest and the most energy your brother has to use during all of that is the time it takes to walk from his cell to the visiting area.

I mean, not to be mean but jfc. Who WOULD choose that?? I get it's her brother, family and all. But my god, write a letter, (which many incarcerated people like as much or more than visits, bc letters can hold more info/catching up/etc than a visit, and can be read over and over when feeling lonely or needing an encouraging word / friendly voice). Or put money on their commisary for treats. Or do a Zoom visit! Or even a phone call-- ITS PRISON, they are GLAD for ANY break in the monotony lmao and prison visits are.....grim AF. And it's just talking on a phone behind glass, or even a zoom call where you're in the lobby, prisoner is in his cell. \n\n I know, I have worked with prison populations closely in multiple jobs. Like, I bet brother would be  overjoyed if his sister put $50 on his account, and/or  wrote a bunch of long letters just talking about nothing and everything, then mailed one a day or every other day, or even weekly- mail call is a way to alleviate boredom, remember life and loved ones outside, keep up to date on current happenings with friends and family, and most of all, shows they are still thought about (you often feel separate from the world, forgotten and moved past while in prisons) and cared about even tho they \"fucked up\" (a surprising insecurity most prisoners worry about- that no one will still love them bc they \"are horrible/failure/embarrassment/etc)\n\n No reason for sister to have to go in the world's grimmest, most depressing/boring vacay with her only week off in half a decade lmao\n\n\n(Also, was anyone else surprised as I was at the conclusion of her talking about the distance? Lol  she said the prison is on the opposite coast and is  a \"long trip\"- so I'm thinking, ok, east coast to west or vice versa, yeah, at least a 12 hr flight, don't blame her---- wait, what? 3 hours? THREE? and they are going for a week instead of driving or whatever? Like, I commute 3 hrs EACH DAY- if I drove 3 hours one way, I'd end up in another very small podunk mountain town not even near state lines, let alone the opposite coast! \ud83d\ude02 this is just so comical to me as an American, which I guess OP is not. Lucky, to have trains and no vast distances to cover drive all the damn time!!.)", "Yeah, maybe he'll even die horribly in there with subpar medical care! Lololol! Maybe he's innocent, and has had his life destroyed! Holy shit, my sides! Maybe OP is upset about the situation, and cares about his brother?

Thanks friend!\n\n/s", "it's not the culture - it's the bloody roads, the weather (wind/rain) and the boredom.

You're complaining about 3 hours one way? You realize that driving there, visiting, staying the night, and driving back the next day is a completely normal and easy way to compromise with your parents that still leaves you five-and-a-half days to do whatever you personally want to do?\n\nLike, sure. You don't HAVE to go. But not even compromising for ONE DAY (where you don't even have to drive, you can take the train and rest/read a book/relax with music/etc.) is going to show your brother exactly how much you care about him. And I don't think you will have a good relationship anymore.\n\nSo it's less about being an asshole, and more about social obligations. Do you want to keep a good relationship with your parents and brother? Then go, even for just one day. If you don't care about losing those familial relationships, then stay home.\n\nEDIT: I saw your notes to other people who didn't respond in the way you liked. Yes, I understand you're exhausted. You've been doing a great service to the people you care for and you deserve your break. But that doesn't change the fact that your actions are going to set the tone for your interactions with your parents and brother going forward. They're going to remember what you choose to do here, which is why I say to take that into account when you decide what to do. If you don't get along with your parents, then go ahead and stay home. But if you honestly care about keeping a good relationship with all three of them, then go visit, even for one day.", "NTA. My only question is for your sake though - have you ever visited your brother in prison before or anyone? If not it would be better for you to time it to go with a family member the first time - it will be much less stressful for you. It\u2019s a very confronting experience.", "NTA. Most inmates understand the situation.\n\nYou can always write him a letter. There is nothing wrong with putting a smile on his face during mail call. (it does suck when you get no love at mail call) It doesn't matter if its just a postcard or a lengthy heartfelt letter, it all counts.\n\nYes it's always nice to get a visit, but remember he has his life inside as well. He has his schedule (not set by him) and visit are not scheduled around his.(yes I know its part of the price he has to pay). Classes, yard, work, whatever. And it's not like he just drops what hes doing and walks to the Visiting Room. Its a process and one may hate knowing his loved ones are sitting alone waiting for him in a room that is less than comfortable, filled with inmates of all different flavors, while he gets pulled form where ever he is, goes back to his bunk, gets ready for visit. \n\n AGAIN ITS ALWAYS NICE TO GET A VISIT. \n\nBut a letter that one can relax in the bunk with, read over and over. When times get less than fun inside he can reread his letters and hold on to some of the outside. It allows you to take your time and write what you want to say, lets him know whats going in your life with keeping your voice down. \n\nRemember you have paid a price with his crime as well. He probably understands this, and if you just communicate with him he will let you know how he feels about visits, money, and mail.", "NTA.
