Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). \n\n\nOn Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. \n\nMy niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, \"really ugly\" and made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nSurprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.", "created_utc": 1672674833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101fvqg/aita_for_laughing_at_my_nieces_gift/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Crochet is a series of knots but it isn't easy, even people who have done it for decades have flops. Your neice tried her hand at something very difficult and you made her feel like shit. Now make it up to her l, take her to the craft store and get her a few supplies, a book on crochet or some other stuff she is interested in so she can work at get better", "I had a similar thing happen to me but with a drawing when I was a kid. After that happened I threw away all my drawings and never wanted to draw again. You probably did destroy her confidence and it may never come back. YTA big time.", "You are absolutely the asshole. Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA Just food for thought - everyone I\u2019ve ever bought a gift set for, I honestly grabbed the first thing and then forgot about it. Everyone I\u2019ve crocheted something for I still think about today.", "YTA. She's twelve and she worked really hard on something. Man, it breaks my heart just to think about her getting laughed at. Poor kiddo.", "YTA. She was so proud of what she put time and effort into and you just laughed in her face.There is no way you can make it up to her", "YTA, she's a child and you made fun of her work. Furthermore, you laughed for *10 minutes*, what is wrong with you.", "YTA * \u267e\n\nUnless you're 12 years old yourself, I don't know why you are even asking this question. \n\nAsshole!", "What is wrong with you and your wife?\n\nI have a niece around the same age, I hang her art on my wall. Is it a Rembrandt, no. But it's something *she made* for me and I cherish it. \n\nShe'll ask me to take it down when she grows up and gets embarrassed by it most probably, but until then, I don't care how ugly anyone thinks it is. It stays displayed, proudly. \n\nI can't blame you for getting a laughing fit, it happens. But you shouldn't have burst out laughing in front of her and for several minutes before going to the bathroom. That's where you became TA.\n\nYour wife also needs to worry less about her prestige and understand that no one that enters your house will think you bought that doll and displayed it for admiration.", "YTA. Laughing at a gift somebody was looking forward to giving you is just mean. You've likely permanently damaged your niece's self-image with your inappropriate reaction.", "While I understand the struggle with laughing at stuff like that, YTA. But I'm pretty sure you know that, because if how you feel.\n\nBut it's not like you are a compkete asshole. Stuff like this happens. Now it's on you to fix things.\n\nYour niece says she sucks at art. So what yoz could do is get her something to improve. Telling her she doesn't suck alone obviously won't work.\n\nSo maybe get her a couse or a workshop where she can try out different art things either alone or together with you.", "YTA. 10 minutes?? How could it be THAT hilarious?  She made you a gift, told you how excited she was about it, and you just laughed at her. Congratulations on hurting her feelings and crushing her confidence.", "YTA, absolutely. Maybe you could find a local craft store and sign both of you up for a crochet class?", "YTA. You just completely crushed a prepubescent child who is at an extremely impressionable age. I feel so sad that she was so excited to give you the gift and you laughed in her face! Extremely cruel behaviour on your part.", "YTA. Ten minutes to control yourself? You are an asshole.", "YTA and so is your wife. Wtf is wrong with you both ?", "YTA. And she will never forget this. When I was twelve I wanted to try baking so I made the pumpkin pie for thanksgiving. I overheard my aunt telling everyone she wanted to throw up after trying it (she didn\u2019t).  I\u2019m not going to say it scarred me or \u201cI never baked again\u201d (I did). But I never forgot how she embarrassed me in front of the entire family.", "YTA, fix it.  \n\n\n\"Niece, I am so sorry for the way I reacted to your gift. I took a kind a thoughtful gesture that certainly took you a lot of time to make special for me, and I ruined it. Niece, please don't let my reaction steer you away from your passion for creativity. I certainly could never crochet an animal like that, and it shows incredible dedication to finish a crochet project. I acted like an asshole (yes, say asshole, she'll appreciate you being candid and talking to her like an adult) to you. Let's be real here, you don't suck at art. Crochet is a new skill you are learning, and I am truly impressed that you have started picking up that skill at such a young age. Please keep having fun creating, and please continue to practice and explore new mediums. Create art you love. I hope that I can someday earn your trust back enough to deserve another one of your heartfelt creations. Again, I am so sorry. I am very proud of you.\" Then take her to Michael's and let her pick out some fucking yarn.", "Yta and so is your wife. \nJust wow at the both of you.", "YTA, dude no matter how bad it is you shouldn't have laughed at it infront of everyone. She must've really put in a lot of effort to make it special for you. Now you've given her a reason to feel she isn't good at art.", "YTA why on earth would you think you might not be?", "YTA. Shame on you.", "Yes, YTA for laughing and crushing a 12-year-old\u2019s  confidence. I get that it was uncontrollable, but did you really have to lock yourself in the bathroom for ten minutes?", "YTA. Damn, you and your wife are mean.", "YTA\n\nControl your laughter. It can't have been that hilarious. But okay, you laughed. Don't run to the bathroom for 10 minutes. You go give her a giant hug, tell her how happy it makes you, find a spot for it and set about naming it with her. There are a lot of ways you could have recovered.", "YTA.", "YTA. What kind of monster laughs at a child like that?!? She put time, effort and thought into your gift\u2026and you laughed at it? I mean come on dude. You know you are the AH. And of course you destroyed her confidence. I\u2019m an adult and if someone did that to me my confidence would take a hit. Imagine how much worse it is for a child. \n\nYour wife sucks too.", "YTA\n\nPlease point her to r/crochet because the people there are so nice and wholesome and not as mean as you. Crochet is a lot of work, she's 12, a beginner, and needs encouragement not being ridiculed.", "YTA. You knew she was excited and it meant a lot to her. You could have covered with something like \u201comg thank you so much it\u2019s cheering me up so much just looking at it!\u201d I can\u2019t imagine laughing uncontrollably at a gift and excusing yourself before saying anything at all to at least attempt damage control", "YTA.\n\nYour poor self-discipline hurt your niece and that makes you a bit of an ass. She made something crap, kids often do, but the gift isn't what they're actually giving you - it's not what they wrap in the paper: It's that they're prepared to be vulnerable and to show you their hope to learn something and be better. \n\nAnd that's the gift, and you apparently found that she wanted to make something and give it to you, and liked you enough to be vulnerable, utterly hilarious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could get a burst of laughter followed by an apology to your niece. But you couldn't control yourself for ten whole minutes? Having been given a pre-warning? You knew it was going to be not that great. You knew she was a kid, and she'd just started. And furthermore, she was excited about giving it to you. And you're an adult; you're responsible for controlling your emotions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you're not going to make good on that apology. The appropriate response for an apology isn't to ***lie*** \\--- which you did to her by the way - you just told us that you thought it was terrible, and her that you really liked it, and she called you on that. The appropriate sense of mind for an apology is grovelling: *I did this thing. Which hurt you. And I regret it. Please accept my apology.* \n\nYou didn't apologise, you lied. There's a difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, yeah, it's a harsh thing to say - but given what you've said (and maybe there are other ameliorating factors there you didn't think to mention...) YTA. A lie isn't an apology.", "YTA. Majorly! How could you?! That\u2019s the most asinine thing to do to a child at Christmas. She will never forget this and you may have irreparably damaged her love of crafting and arts, not to mention your relationship with her. And your wife? It makes her UnCoMfORtAbLe? It\u2019s a gift from a child. You should ALL be ashamed of yourselves.", "YTA \n\nShe probably spent hours working on it specifically with you in mind because she loves you.\n\nYou probably crushed her spirits and I hope she never makes anything for you ever again.\n\nAnd obviously y'all care more about looks and aesthetic than something nice a CHILD made and making them happy.", "YTA\n\nA child is learning a new skill and makes something for you. It takes time and money to crochet a gift. You were disrespectful and hurt her feelings after she lovingly gave you something that she made.", "YTA\n\nNot a lot you can do at this point, but you did destroy her. Things that would have worked, maybe still can, include \"I see the love you put into making this for me, I appreciate it. I appreciate the time and can see your progress as you worked on this for me. It will always be dear to me because you made it.\"\n\nLaughing for a full 10 min...what a fucking AH move.", "YTA\n\nI get the initial laughter response but ffs she\u2019s 12 \u2014 be someone better and prepare yourself for wtfuckery anytime kids are involved, especially if they have a surprise for you.\n\nYou could have mentally prepped, knowing that this was a surprise that was important to the kid.", "YTA, sounds like you were the only child in that room.", "YTA all you had to do was say thanks instead of belittling her early attempts knitting and crochet are not easy", "YTA\n\nOf a singularly massive size.", "YTA: a 12 year old child cares about you so much that she commits a reasonable amount of time and effort to make you a thing that you ROTFL at to her face and family. She sounds like a sensitive soul and you\u2019ve probably crapped over your relationship with her. You have a lot of making up to do.", "YTA\n\nI have a feeling that in a few years we will be reading \"AITA for expecting a crochet blanket for my kid when everyone else in the family gets one?\"", "YTA\n\n\nI feel really bad for your niece if this is true. \n\n\nThe good news for you is you probably won't get a gift from her next year.", "YTA You don\u2019t mention your age, but being old enough to have a wife should mean being old enough to control yourself", "YTA for crushing a 12-year-old\u2019s confidence - learn to control your reactions better.", "YTA and your wife is too!", "YTA \n\nYou had to leave the room, at that point you weren\u2019t laughing with her, you were laughing at her. Your wife does sound like a perfect match for you if a homemade gift from a child can be so ugly it makes her uncomfortable.", "Wtf is wrong with you? YTA.", "\ud83d\ude33YTA, of course.  Let\u2019s see you make something better.  She put a lot of time into making you something special and you laugh in her face?  You got balls even posting this.", "YTA.

Holy. shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can uncontrollably laugh and say you love it at the same time. I could have pulled it off. Also, I would definitely have loved it.", "YTA, you're an adult for crying out loud.  Making a 12 yr old cry because you can't control yourself is shameful.  I hope you don't have kids", "YTA and you should feel bad for destroying your 12 year old nieces confidence. You laughed for a solid 10 minutes, seriously?", "YTA. 10 minutes, really? You've ruined her confidence, and quite possibly her enjoyment of crochet. Poor kid.", "YTA and you know it. I get that you couldn't control your laughter, but you handled it about as badly as a person could. You've gotta do something to make it up to your niece.\n\nAlso, your wife sounds like a real winner.", "INFO: Do you have a picture of this horrendously, hilariously ugly crocheted project? I'd just like to decide exactly how much of an asshole you are based on how adorable it most assuredly was. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Of course YTA.  Jesus fucking Christ.", "YTA - even if it was unintentional. Your wife is an AH too. There was no reason for her to pull you aside during the party to let you know how ugly it is and that it needs to come down later.", "YTA. You completely humiliated and shot her down about something she was passionate about. It doesn't matter how bad it looks - it's a start for her, and she would've gotten better with time and practice if her confidence wasn't completely shattered by you. I wouldn't doubt it if she never crochets again because of you. Good job.", "YTA x1000.  You can't help but laugh at what you KNOW is your niece's serious effort in her favorite craft? She made it for YOU and it clearly was very difficult and she was brave enough to trust you with her hard work even if it didn't turn out exactly like she wanted it to, and you rewarded her not just with a nervous laugh or two, but a full 10 minutes of humiliation?", "YTA- I get not being able to control an initial reaction but laughing for minutes on end...who can't control themselves like that?", "Why you even asking?? You know you suck. YTA. OBVIOUSLY", "Yikes\u2026. You couldn\u2019t stop laughing at her gift\u2026 are you also 12? YTA", "YTA. Fiber arts have a decent learning curve, and most projects a new fiber artist will make are usually pretty bad. But you have to make bad projects to learn how it all works and fits together. What your niece needed was support and encouragement.\n\n\"Thanks for the gift! Handmade gifts are so cool!\"\n\nI've been a knitter for over a decade. Crochet was the gateway drug that got me there. I made some absolutely hideous stuff, but (almost) everyone that ever got a gift was gracious and encouraging to me upon receiving it. My mom still has 2 or 3 scarves that aren't very good at all, but she loves them and wears them because I put in the time and love and effort for her\n\nIf I ever reacted to any gift the way you reacted, my family would absolutely tear me a new one because it's just not right to outright laugh at a gift, especially one that took *hours* to make.", "Well, you kind of admit in the post already... YTA.", "Not only are YTA .. but your wife majorly sucks as well. It made her so uncomfortable she needed you to take it down!?   \n\n\u2026 genuinely what is wrong with BOTH of you!?

Your poor niece will quite literally never forget your reaction.", "YTA she worked hard on that gift and made it out of love. And you chose to make fun of her and laugh at her. How horrible", "YTA. And your reaction is not a natural reaction to this. It\u2019s completely over the top and exaggerated. What the hell is wrong with you and your wife?", "YTA she\u2019s 12 and she was SO proud of something she made that she gave it to you! And instead of being supportive you crushed her. My niece and nephew gave me a cup and saucer they had scribbled on (they were 4 and 1) and I displayed that thing on my bookshelf for 9 years! Kids remember who was and wasn\u2019t supportive of them. Congratulations for ruining your relationship with her, probably permanently.", "Seriously?! Of course YTA. You embarrassed your niece and scarred her for life. She\u2019ll never forget your reaction to the gift she spent time making for you.", "YTA how horrible. She tried her best and she seemed proud of it. You could\u2019ve held your laughter and tell her how happy it made you. How nice of you to destroy the confidence of a 12 year old. Wtf is wrong with you", "YTA, you made a 12 year old cry on Christmas. Wtf!?", "YTA. Your niece tried her best and is starting out. Crochet isn't easy, making things out of yarn isn't easy. I'd like to see you do better. She's 12. She deserves to be supported and applauded for her efforts, not laughed at. It's so rude. If she never makes or gives you a present again, I don't blame her.", "YTA. It\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t a masterpiece but you\u2019re an adult. You need to make sure she doesn\u2019t give up artwork bc of this. And your wife seems like an insensitive AH too.", "She's 12, she spent time and effort making something for you and was clearly excited to give it to you and to see your reaction. She cared about you to make something for you and she cared about your reaction - which was to laugh - so of course she's upset. A child, let alone an adult, will easily equate one instance where someone they trusted laughed at their work to mean, \"I suck at art, I'm giving up\".\n\nSo yes, unfortunately, YTA", "Info: have you ever tried to crochet or know how difficult it can be? \n\nShe will have put a LOT of time and effort into your gift and you just mocked it? And your wife refuses to have it out as it\u2019s not visually pretty enough for her ever so delicate sensitivities? \n\nI hope that she remembers this, and from now on, no matter how good she becomes, the two of you *never* get anything that she has spent time and effort on (let alone the fact that yarn isn\u2019t cheap). From now on you get socks. Store bought socks. Never anything made with love that you can throw back in her face and mock/laugh at. I hope that this doesn\u2019t make her give up crochet as that is a possibility when someone is first trying a new craft. \n\nShame on you, your wife and anyone else who can\u2019t see how cruel you were. \n\nYTA.", "You know YTA.\n\nYou laughed at her and KEPT laughing at her?  It could have been the worst thing you've ever seen and you pretend to be excited,  what is wrong with you. \n\nShe will never feel the same way about you and probably that's good for her.", "YTA\n\nWhat was the thought process here?\n\n\"Haha, my niece took the time to hand craft a gift for me, let me laugh at it in front of her and our family and put a dint in her self-esteem!\"\n\nPeople, especially children, remember things that hurt them. Also, your wife's an AH, too.", "YTA and so is your wife after her little side comment. Imagine being a grown adult and hurting a child\u2019s feelings this bad.. this poor kids never gonna want to do art again.", "YTA- You can\u2019t control yourself from completely humiliating your 12 year old niece? That makes me think you are an AH really deep down, not just this situation. And it looks like your wife is right there with you.", "YTA. You had to leave the room for 10 minutes to get over it? You\u2019re a bigger child than she is.", "You, and your wife especially, are AHs.

Ugly stuffies are the best stuffies.", "YTA. Both you and your wife are.", "YTA. It\u2019s very clear that your niece put a lot of effort into the gift. And if I was a kid and that happened to me, that would destroy me. You need to control your laughter as hard as it may be.", "Wow, YTA\n\nI was hoping that you were a teenager yourself, but you mention a wife so sadly that doesn't seem to be the case. This is an extremely immature reaction to have to something that's really not that funny, and your wife sounds just as awful for making you take the gift down. \n\nLaughing for TEN MINUTES indicates that you have little to no self-control, which is concerning. Grow up.", "You should have realized that a 12 year old isn\u2019t going to give you an amazing present. You had too high hopes for what it could be. Had you been more realistic you might not have reacted as you did. YTA", "YTA. Figure out a craft you can give full effort to and still fail. Let her see your frustration.

YTA", "You spent 10 minutes laughing uncontrollably at a 12 year old's gift, that she made herself? Who the hell laughs uncontrollably for that long? You were probably her favourite uncle, because 12 year old kids don't put serious time and effort into gifts for low grade relations. I stress were, you needn't worry about any more of her sub par art/craft presents cluttering up your house because she's done with you. And as for your wife? She felt uncomfortable about a crocheted animal made by a kid, so uncomfortable that she couldn't pick it up herself? Hysterical laughter man and threatened by woollen animal lady deserve each other, I hope that you never separate and bring your weird shit to someone else.", "Something similar happened to me when I was around ten but it wasn\u2019t a beloved aunt/uncle. \n\nI tried to do something nice for my older sister\u2019s best friend. She was around 16 and had done a lot for my sister. I had tried needlepoint (which was a huge hobby of hers) and gave her the second or third piece I had completed. I worked really hard on it and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWhen she opened it she smirked and said something like \u201cwell I\u2019m sure when you get older you\u2019ll learn how to do it properly\u201d \n\nDevastated me. And quite possibly contributed to my fear of trying new things/fear of failure \n\nI doubt you\u2019ll ever repair the relationship 100%, (couldn\u2019t stop laughing for 10 minutes???) but I encourage you to reach out to your niece and offer her a sincere apology \n\nYTA", "YTA.

But also please encourage her to keep making art! Fibre artists are awesome. I hope she keeps on creating.", "YTA.  Poor child, she will never forget how you humiliated her with your response, I doubt your relationship will ever be the same.", "Wow...YTA and a huge one at that. A child is learning a new craft, worked very hard to create something to gift to you and you, old enough to be married, laughed in her face? This poor child tried and you squashed that in her face. Please don't ever have kids until you grow up.", "YTA. I guess you won't have to worry about any of her gifts to you in the future.", "YTA and have traumatized her for life.

I pray you guys don\u2019t have child of your own.", "YTA", "YTA, your wife is TA - and what's this \"(which was actually art supplies)\" as if it exonerates you being a massive asshole. \n\nEven if it is awful, laughing for 10 minutes straight seems really strange, like you were desperate for the attention it brought.

YTA x 10000. i have a fuckign painted chicken on the back of my oven the small top of it above the dials i call the abortion egg cause half my kid painted normal half is globbed on red but do i call it that and laugh infront of her? NO. shes a CHILD. she worked hard and was halppy to give it to me.  \n\n\nalso your wife is a fckn AH too, you dont need to keep it up forever. you can shove it in a corner of a room with other display itenms too and youll eventually not see it but would make niece feel good to see it even tho youd forget it was there  \n\n\nbut i wouldnt do that now bc now your niece knows how you feel, and itll come off more as mocking.  \n\n\nshes new to it! no one makes great things first time! she went thru the effort of planning, and making it and got it done ahead of time. you are such an extreme AH. shes only 12. thats a lot of effort and mental ability to stay on task at that age she probably cares for you quite a bit and you just laughed in her face, an adult whom she looks up to and is suppose to be able to take examples from on how to behave,", "YTA, big time. I'm surprised that you even have to ask tbh.", "Yta oh my god... Don't you have a \"child mode\"?! When my 2yo niece wants to talk about shiny unicorns I talk with her for ours even though I don't give a crap and some of her unicorns plushies are comically ugly. When my 9yo nephew wants to show me his drawings or magic tricks I pretend they are good and that I'm impressed. And you know what I don't even have to try that hard to pretend, I held both of them as babies, it's absolutely magic that they have hobbies and interests and everything they do is wonderful. Not for any adult that don't love them but for me it is and I don't get why you don't have that filter over your niece creation. \nPlus, your wife asked you to remove the gift from her sight ??!

Sure, this one sucks, but with some practice, she'll be crocheting some pretty cool stuff.", "YTA and so is your wife. This girl put effort and work to produce something for you and you could not hold back your laughter? And your wife felt uncomfortable for a crochet gift? Was it displaying something NSFW? Was it creepy? I mean what was the problem except it looking funny, why not keeping it up in a good spirit. \n\nThis could have been a good lesson for: \"even if it did not come out as expected I saw your efford and appreciated it\".

It hit me off guard when a teenage girl came out singing opera that she clearly could not handle and it was as if I got haunted by something.  I was so terrified that I couldn't hold it in. I sat in the first row and I couldn't even silently excuse myself! I bit down on my lips and looked down at my camera I was holding, but panicked when I couldn't hold it in. I knew I was a complete asshole but at this point it was involuntary.  When felt my shoulders shuttering and I tried to mask it with a cough, but knew it was not going to work. My husband next to me was holding my 1 year old at which point I ripped him out of his hands so I can use him as a prop to leave the room - like it's a baby emergency. But then, I felt a resistance from him. He wouldn't let him go because it turned out he was burying his face in the one year old's head. After momentary tug-a-war. he let go and l left the recital room consoling a baby that was perfectly fine. We felt terrible and ashamed afterwards and still talk about that incident, but it's really hard to explain this experience if you haven't been momentarily haunted by the AH ghost.", "Wow, yeah YTA.\n\nCongrats on making a 12 year old girl cry, big man.\n\nThe whole \"if you don't have something nice to say, shut up\" seems to have missed you.\n\nAlso, is this how you treat your wife? You sound abusive.", "I have the opposite problem \u2014 when I\u2019m really moved or happy, I start crying.

He\u2019s not a very crafty kid and I never knew of him making anything for anyone else. It was so sweet and thoughtful and made me feel incredibly loved, so I burst into uncontrollable sobs.\n\nPoor kid was devastated because he thought I hated it. I had to do a lot of work to explain to him sometimes bodies process joy differently. So I know it sucks when you can\u2019t control outbursts like crying or laughing, but you\u2019re going to have to work hard to make it up to the kid.

What I would recommend is that you go to see her (if you can). Share a story with her about a time when someone you really liked embarrassed you, so that she knows you understand her embarrassment. And then be gently honest. Tell her that no one makes beautiful crochet items when they are still beginners. It takes a lot of practice. And also, not everyone likes it enough to put in the required time and effort to get to a point where you are really good at something. That is why it\u2019s important to pursue the things that you really, really want to learn and to do.

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). \n\n\nOn Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. \n\nMy niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, \"really ugly\" and made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nSurprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Shame on you!", "You need to name this little crocheted creature (LCC) and take it to various places and send your niece selfies featuring you and LCC and repeatedly let her know you appreciate the love and hard work that went into this gift.

Given that she had to lock herself in the washroom to get control of herself, it sounds like one of those situations, like laughing at a funeral\u2014you KNOW you\u2019re not supposed to laugh and nothing is even *that* funny, but because you\u2019re not supposed to, you end up laughing even harder. I say that because of the locking herself up AND because she feels bad and tried to recover.

It isn't normal to laugh for minutes for a thing like that, unless you never had the basis of living in society or even just in your family.
