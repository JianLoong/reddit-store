Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). \n\n\nOn Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. \n\nMy niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, \"really ugly\" and made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nSurprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.", "created_utc": 1672674833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101fvqg/aita_for_laughing_at_my_nieces_gift/", "score": 15848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Crochet is a series of knots but it isn't easy, even people who have done it for decades have flops. Your neice tried her hand at something very difficult and you made her feel like shit. Now make it up to her l, take her to the craft store and get her a few supplies, a book on crochet or some other stuff she is interested in so she can work at get better", "I had a similar thing happen to me but with a drawing when I was a kid. After that happened I threw away all my drawings and never wanted to draw again. You probably did destroy her confidence and it may never come back. YTA big time.", "You are absolutely the asshole. Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA Just food for thought - everyone I\u2019ve ever bought a gift set for, I honestly grabbed the first thing and then forgot about it. Everyone I\u2019ve crocheted something for I still think about today.", "YTA. She's twelve and she worked really hard on something. Man, it breaks my heart just to think about her getting laughed at. Poor kiddo.\n\nEdit: OP if you see this, I bet there are a ton of us who would love to buy one your niece's crocheted creations if you can get her to start making them again, and help her with an Etsy shop. I'll buy the first one.\n\nEdit 2: Really wasn't expecting this to be the top comment. And a lot of people have rightfully suggested that maybe the next best step isn't the niece selling her creations on the internet. Point taken. But I'd still totally buy one of these crocheted animals, so hopefully someday I can.", "YTA. She was so proud of what she put time and effort into and you just laughed in her face.There is no way you can make it up to her", "YTA, she's a child and you made fun of her work. Furthermore, you laughed for *10 minutes*, what is wrong with you.", "YTA * \u267e\n\nUnless you're 12 years old yourself, I don't know why you are even asking this question. \n\nAsshole!", "What is wrong with you and your wife?\n\nI have a niece around the same age, I hang her art on my wall. Is it a Rembrandt, no. But it's something *she made* for me and I cherish it. \n\nShe'll ask me to take it down when she grows up and gets embarrassed by it most probably, but until then, I don't care how ugly anyone thinks it is. It stays displayed, proudly. \n\nI can't blame you for getting a laughing fit, it happens. But you shouldn't have burst out laughing in front of her and for several minutes before going to the bathroom. That's where you became TA.\n\nYour wife also needs to worry less about her prestige and understand that no one that enters your house will think you bought that doll and displayed it for admiration.", "YTA. Laughing at a gift somebody was looking forward to giving you is just mean. You've likely permanently damaged your niece's self-image with your inappropriate reaction.", "While I understand the struggle with laughing at stuff like that, YTA. But I'm pretty sure you know that, because of how you feel.\n\nBut it's not like you are a complete asshole. Stuff like this happens. Now it's on you to fix things.\n\nYour niece says she sucks at art. So what you could do is get her something to improve. Telling her she doesn't suck alone obviously won't work.\n\nSo maybe get her a course or a workshop where she can try out different art things either alone or together with you.", "YTA. 10 minutes?? How could it be THAT hilarious?  She made you a gift, told you how excited she was about it, and you just laughed at her. Congratulations on hurting her feelings and crushing her confidence.", "YTA, absolutely. Maybe you could find a local craft store and sign both of you up for a crochet class?", "YTA. You just completely crushed a prepubescent child who is at an extremely impressionable age. I feel so sad that she was so excited to give you the gift and you laughed in her face! Extremely cruel behaviour on your part.", "YTA. Ten minutes to control yourself? You are an asshole.", "YTA and so is your wife. Wtf is wrong with you both ?", "YTA. And she will never forget this. When I was twelve I wanted to try baking so I made the pumpkin pie for thanksgiving. I overheard my aunt telling everyone she wanted to throw up after trying it (she didn\u2019t).  I\u2019m not going to say it scarred me or \u201cI never baked again\u201d (I did). But I never forgot how she embarrassed me in front of the entire family.", "YTA, fix it.  \n\n\n\"Niece, I am so sorry for the way I reacted to your gift. I took a kind a thoughtful gesture that certainly took you a lot of time to make special for me, and I ruined it. Niece, please don't let my reaction steer you away from your passion for creativity. I certainly could never crochet an animal like that, and it shows incredible dedication to finish a crochet project. I acted like an asshole (yes, say asshole, she'll appreciate you being candid and talking to her like an adult) to you. Let's be real here, you don't suck at art. Crochet is a new skill you are learning, and I am truly impressed that you have started picking up that skill at such a young age. Please keep having fun creating, and please continue to practice and explore new mediums. Create art you love. I hope that I can someday earn your trust back enough to deserve another one of your heartfelt creations. Again, I am so sorry. I am very proud of you.\" Then take her to Michael's and let her pick out some fucking yarn.", "Yta and so is your wife. \nJust wow at the both of you.", "YTA, dude no matter how bad it is you shouldn't have laughed at it infront of everyone. She must've really put in a lot of effort to make it special for you. Now you've given her a reason to feel she isn't good at art.", "YTA why on earth would you think you might not be?", "YTA. Shame on you.", "Yes, YTA for laughing and crushing a 12-year-old\u2019s  confidence. I get that it was uncontrollable, but did you really have to lock yourself in the bathroom for ten minutes?", "YTA. Damn, you and your wife are mean.", "YTA\n\nControl your laughter. It can't have been that hilarious. But okay, you laughed. Don't run to the bathroom for 10 minutes. You go give her a giant hug, tell her how happy it makes you, find a spot for it and set about naming it with her. There are a lot of ways you could have recovered.", "YTA.", "YTA. What kind of monster laughs at a child like that?!? She put time, effort and thought into your gift\u2026and you laughed at it? I mean come on dude. You know you are the AH. And of course you destroyed her confidence. I\u2019m an adult and if someone did that to me my confidence would take a hit. Imagine how much worse it is for a child. \n\nYour wife sucks too.", "YTA\n\nPlease point her to r/crochet because the people there are so nice and wholesome and not as mean as you. Crochet is a lot of work, she's 12, a beginner, and needs encouragement not being ridiculed.", "YTA. You knew she was excited and it meant a lot to her. You could have covered with something like \u201comg thank you so much it\u2019s cheering me up so much just looking at it!\u201d I can\u2019t imagine laughing uncontrollably at a gift and excusing yourself before saying anything at all to at least attempt damage control", "YTA.\n\nYour poor self-discipline hurt your niece and that makes you a bit of an ass. She made something crap, kids often do, but the gift isn't what they're actually giving you - it's not what they wrap in the paper: It's that they're prepared to be vulnerable and to show you their hope to learn something and be better. \n\nAnd that's the gift, and you apparently found that she wanted to make something and give it to you, and liked you enough to be vulnerable, utterly hilarious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could get a burst of laughter followed by an apology to your niece. But you couldn't control yourself for ten whole minutes? Having been given a pre-warning? You knew it was going to be not that great. You knew she was a kid, and she'd just started. And furthermore, she was excited about giving it to you. And you're an adult; you're responsible for controlling your emotions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you're not going to make good on that apology. The appropriate response for an apology isn't to ***lie*** \\--- which you did to her by the way - you just told us that you thought it was terrible, and her that you really liked it, and she called you on that. The appropriate sense of mind for an apology is grovelling: *I did this thing. Which hurt you. And I regret it. Please accept my apology.* \n\nYou didn't apologise, you lied. There's a difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, yeah, it's a harsh thing to say - but given what you've said (and maybe there are other ameliorating factors there you didn't think to mention...) YTA. A lie isn't an apology.", "YTA. Majorly! How could you?! That\u2019s the most asinine thing to do to a child at Christmas. She will never forget this and you may have irreparably damaged her love of crafting and arts, not to mention your relationship with her. And your wife? It makes her UnCoMfORtAbLe? It\u2019s a gift from a child. You should ALL be ashamed of yourselves.", "YTA \n\nShe probably spent hours working on it specifically with you in mind because she loves you.\n\nYou probably crushed her spirits and I hope she never makes anything for you ever again.\n\nAnd obviously y'all care more about looks and aesthetic than something nice a CHILD made and making them happy.", "YTA\n\nA child is learning a new skill and makes something for you. It takes time and money to crochet a gift. You were disrespectful and hurt her feelings after she lovingly gave you something that she made.", "YTA\n\nNot a lot you can do at this point, but you did destroy her. Things that would have worked, maybe still can, include \"I see the love you put into making this for me, I appreciate it. I appreciate the time and can see your progress as you worked on this for me. It will always be dear to me because you made it.\"\n\nLaughing for a full 10 min...what a fucking AH move.", "YTA\n\nI get the initial laughter response but ffs she\u2019s 12 \u2014 be someone better and prepare yourself for wtfuckery anytime kids are involved, especially if they have a surprise for you.\n\nYou could have mentally prepped, knowing that this was a surprise that was important to the kid.", "YTA, sounds like you were the only child in that room.", "YTA all you had to do was say thanks instead of belittling her early attempts knitting and crochet are not easy", "YTA\n\nOf a singularly massive size.", "YTA: a 12 year old child cares about you so much that she commits a reasonable amount of time and effort to make you a thing that you ROTFL at to her face and family. She sounds like a sensitive soul and you\u2019ve probably crapped over your relationship with her. You have a lot of making up to do.", "YTA\n\nI have a feeling that in a few years we will be reading \"AITA for expecting a crochet blanket for my kid when everyone else in the family gets one?\"", "YTA\n\n\nI feel really bad for your niece if this is true. \n\n\nThe good news for you is you probably won't get a gift from her next year.", "YTA You don\u2019t mention your age, but being old enough to have a wife should mean being old enough to control yourself", "YTA for crushing a 12-year-old\u2019s confidence - learn to control your reactions better.", "YTA and your wife is too!", "YTA \n\nYou had to leave the room, at that point you weren\u2019t laughing with her, you were laughing at her.

Holy. shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can uncontrollably laugh and say you love it at the same time. I could have pulled it off. Also, I would definitely have loved it.", "YTA, you're an adult for crying out loud.  Making a 12 yr old cry because you can't control yourself is shameful.  I hope you don't have kids", "YTA and you should feel bad for destroying your 12 year old nieces confidence. You laughed for a solid 10 minutes, seriously?", "YTA. 10 minutes, really? You've ruined her confidence, and quite possibly her enjoyment of crochet. Poor kid.", "YTA and you know it. I get that you couldn't control your laughter, but you handled it about as badly as a person could. You've gotta do something to make it up to your niece.\n\nAlso, your wife sounds like a real winner.", "INFO: Do you have a picture of this horrendously, hilariously ugly crocheted project? I'd just like to decide exactly how much of an asshole you are based on how adorable it most assuredly was. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Of course YTA.  Jesus fucking Christ.", "YTA - even if it was unintentional. Your wife is an AH too. There was no reason for her to pull you aside during the party to let you know how ugly it is and that it needs to come down later.", "YTA. You completely humiliated and shot her down about something she was passionate about. It doesn't matter how bad it looks - it's a start for her, and she would've gotten better with time and practice if her confidence wasn't completely shattered by you. I wouldn't doubt it if she never crochets again because of you. Good job.", "YTA x1000.  You can't help but laugh at what you KNOW is your niece's serious effort in her favorite craft? She made it for YOU and it clearly was very difficult and she was brave enough to trust you with her hard work even if it didn't turn out exactly like she wanted it to, and you rewarded her not just with a nervous laugh or two, but a full 10 minutes of humiliation?", "YTA- I get not being able to control an initial reaction but laughing for minutes on end...who can't control themselves like that?", "Why you even asking?? You know you suck. YTA. OBVIOUSLY", "Yikes\u2026. You couldn\u2019t stop laughing at her gift\u2026 are you also 12? YTA", "YTA. Fiber arts have a decent learning curve, and most projects a new fiber artist will make are usually pretty bad. But you have to make bad projects to learn how it all works and fits together. What your niece needed was support and encouragement.\n\n\"Thanks for the gift! Handmade gifts are so cool!\"\n\nI've been a knitter for over a decade. Crochet was the gateway drug that got me there. I made some absolutely hideous stuff, but (almost) everyone that ever got a gift was gracious and encouraging to me upon receiving it. My mom still has 2 or 3 scarves that aren't very good at all, but she loves them and wears them because I put in the time and love and effort for her\n\nIf I ever reacted to any gift the way you reacted, my family would absolutely tear me a new one because it's just not right to outright laugh at a gift, especially one that took *hours* to make.", "Well, you kind of admit in the post already...

And your reaction is not a natural reaction to this. It\u2019s completely over the top and exaggerated. What the hell is wrong with you and your wife?", "YTA she\u2019s 12 and she was SO proud of something she made that she gave it to you! And instead of being supportive you crushed her. My niece and nephew gave me a cup and saucer they had scribbled on (they were 4 and 1) and I displayed that thing on my bookshelf for 9 years! Kids remember who was and wasn\u2019t supportive of them. Congratulations for ruining your relationship with her, probably permanently.", "Seriously?! Of course YTA. You embarrassed your niece and scarred her for life. She\u2019ll never forget your reaction to the gift she spent time making for you.", "YTA how horrible. She tried her best and she seemed proud of it. You could\u2019ve held your laughter and tell her how happy it made you. How nice of you to destroy the confidence of a 12 year old. Wtf is wrong with you", "YTA, you made a 12 year old cry on Christmas. Wtf!?", "YTA. Your niece tried her best and is starting out. Crochet isn't easy, making things out of yarn isn't easy. I'd like to see you do better. She's 12. She deserves to be supported and applauded for her efforts, not laughed at. It's so rude. If she never makes or gives you a present again, I don't blame her.", "YTA. It\u2019s understandable that it wasn\u2019t a masterpiece but you\u2019re an adult. You need to make sure she doesn\u2019t give up artwork bc of this. And your wife seems like an insensitive AH too.", "She's 12, she spent time and effort making something for you and was clearly excited to give it to you and to see your reaction. She cared about you to make something for you and she cared about your reaction - which was to laugh - so of course she's upset. A child, let alone an adult, will easily equate one instance where someone they trusted laughed at their work to mean, \"I suck at art, I'm giving up\".\n\nSo yes, unfortunately, YTA", "Info: have you ever tried to crochet or know how difficult it can be? \n\nShe will have put a LOT of time and effort into your gift and you just mocked it? And your wife refuses to have it out as it\u2019s not visually pretty enough for her ever so delicate sensitivities? \n\nI hope that she remembers this, and from now on, no matter how good she becomes, the two of you *never* get anything that she has spent time and effort on (let alone the fact that yarn isn\u2019t cheap). From now on you get socks. Store bought socks. Never anything made with love that you can throw back in her face and mock/laugh at. I hope that this doesn\u2019t make her give up crochet as that is a possibility when someone is first trying a new craft. \n\nShame on you, your wife and anyone else who can\u2019t see how cruel you were. \n\nYTA.", "You know YTA.\n\nYou laughed at her and KEPT laughing at her?  It could have been the worst thing you've ever seen and you pretend to be excited,  what is wrong with you. \n\nShe will never feel the same way about you and probably that's good for her.", "YTA\n\nWhat was the thought process here?\n\n\"Haha, my niece took the time to hand craft a gift for me, let me laugh at it in front of her and our family and put a dint in her self-esteem!\"\n\nPeople, especially children, remember things that hurt them. Also, your wife's an AH, too.", "YTA and so is your wife after her little side comment.

Ugly stuffies are the best stuffies.", "YTA. Both you and your wife are.", "YTA. It\u2019s very clear that your niece put a lot of effort into the gift.

You need to control your laughter as hard as it may be.", "Wow, YTA\n\nI was hoping that you were a teenager yourself, but you mention a wife so sadly that doesn't seem to be the case. This is an extremely immature reaction to have to something that's really not that funny, and your wife sounds just as awful for making you take the gift down. \n\nLaughing for TEN MINUTES indicates that you have little to no self-control, which is concerning.

Had you been more realistic you might not have reacted as you did. YTA", "YTA. Figure out a craft you can give full effort to and still fail. Let her see your frustration.

YTA", "You spent 10 minutes laughing uncontrollably at a 12 year old's gift, that she made herself? Who the hell laughs uncontrollably for that long?

I stress were, you needn't worry about any more of her sub par art/craft presents cluttering up your house because she's done with you. And as for your wife? She felt uncomfortable about a crocheted animal made by a kid, so uncomfortable that she couldn't pick it up herself?

She was around 16 and had done a lot for my sister. I had tried needlepoint (which was a huge hobby of hers) and gave her the second or third piece I had completed. I worked really hard on it and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWhen she opened it she smirked and said something like \u201cwell I\u2019m sure when you get older you\u2019ll learn how to do it properly\u201d \n\nDevastated me.

But also please encourage her to keep making art! Fibre artists are awesome. I hope she keeps on creating.", "YTA.

A child is learning a new craft, worked very hard to create something to gift to you and you, old enough to be married, laughed in her face? This poor child tried and you squashed that in her face.

NO. shes a CHILD. she worked hard and was halppy to give it to me.  \n\n\nalso your wife is a fckn AH too, you dont need to keep it up forever. you can shove it in a corner of a room with other display itenms too and youll eventually not see it but would make niece feel good to see it even tho youd forget it was there  \n\n\nbut i wouldnt do that now bc now your niece knows how you feel, and itll come off more as mocking.  \n\n\nshes new to it! no one makes great things first time! she went thru the effort of planning, and making it and got it done ahead of time. you are such an extreme AH. shes only 12. thats a lot of effort and mental ability to stay on task at that age she probably cares for you quite a bit and you just laughed in her face, an adult whom she looks up to and is suppose to be able to take examples from on how to behave,", "YTA, big time. I'm surprised that you even have to ask tbh.", "Yta oh my god... Don't you have a \"child mode\"?! When my 2yo niece wants to talk about shiny unicorns I talk with her for ours even though I don't give a crap and some of her unicorns plushies are comically ugly. When my 9yo nephew wants to show me his drawings or magic tricks I pretend they are good and that I'm impressed. And you know what I don't even have to try that hard to pretend, I held both of them as babies, it's absolutely magic that they have hobbies and interests and everything they do is wonderful. Not for any adult that don't love them but for me it is and I don't get why you don't have that filter over your niece creation. \nPlus, your wife asked you to remove the gift from her sight ??!

Sure, this one sucks, but with some practice, she'll be crocheting some pretty cool stuff.", "YTA and so is your wife. This girl put effort and work to produce something for you and you could not hold back your laughter? And your wife felt uncomfortable for a crochet gift? Was it displaying something NSFW? Was it creepy? I mean what was the problem except it looking funny, why not keeping it up in a good spirit. \n\nThis could have been a good lesson for: \"even if it did not come out as expected I saw your efford and appreciated it\".

I understand that this may seem dramatic, but hear me out - this could affect the rest of her life. When I was young (like 8) I had an art teacher who made fun of one of my art projects in front of the class and basically told me that art wasn\u2019t for me. It destroyed me. It also kept me from ever trying anything creative *ever again.* \n\nI don\u2019t remember many of my teachers or the things they said to me\u2026 but decades later, I remember that art teacher and how she made me feel.", "YTA, you could have not laughed, but you did. Now you've completely destroyed her self esteem and I doubt she'll ever pick up a crochet hook again.poor child", "YTA\n\nYou crushed your nieces confidence and you're not sure how to, \"make it up to her\"? Guess what...you can't. That ship has sailed and it's not reversing course because you feel bad.\n\nYour niece will always remember this. Also, at age 12, confidence isn't easy to come by. She found a hobby she loved and she gave it her all. Just to have a grown ass man laugh at her. She will think about your reaction every time she picks up her crochet tools. \n\nGood job Uncle Asshole.", "YTA, but from one A to another, I totally sympathize.. years ago when I went for my then 2nd grader's piano recital and didn't realize it was not just a piano recital but also a singing recital. It hit me off guard when a teenage girl came out singing opera that she clearly could not handle and it was as if I got haunted by something.  I was so terrified that I couldn't hold it in. I sat in the first row and I couldn't even silently excuse myself! I bit down on my lips and looked down at my camera I was holding, but panicked when I couldn't hold it in. I knew I was a complete asshole but at this point it was involuntary.  When felt my shoulders shuttering and I tried to mask it with a cough, but knew it was not going to work. My husband next to me was holding my 1 year old at which point I ripped him out of his hands so I can use him as a prop to leave the room - like it's a baby emergency. But then, I felt a resistance from him. He wouldn't let him go because it turned out he was burying his face in the one year old's head. After momentary tug-a-war. he let go and l left the recital room consoling a baby that was perfectly fine. We felt terrible and ashamed afterwards and still talk about that incident, but it's really hard to explain this experience if you haven't been momentarily haunted by the AH ghost.", "Wow, yeah YTA.\n\nCongrats on making a 12 year old girl cry, big man.\n\nThe whole \"if you don't have something nice to say, shut up\" seems to have missed you.\n\nAlso, is this how you treat your wife? You sound abusive.", "I have the opposite problem \u2014 when I\u2019m really moved or happy, I start crying. One time my baby cousin made some hot chocolate in a jar at school, and I was so surprised that he thought to give it to me out of all the people he could have given it to. He\u2019s not a very crafty kid and I never knew of him making anything for anyone else. It was so sweet and thoughtful and made me feel incredibly loved, so I burst into uncontrollable sobs.\n\nPoor kid was devastated because he thought I hated it. I had to do a lot of work to explain to him sometimes bodies process joy differently. So I know it sucks when you can\u2019t control outbursts like crying or laughing, but you\u2019re going to have to work hard to make it up to the kid. I don\u2019t think anyone was the asshole here, so I\u2019m going with NAH.

To be a great artist you have to have the right mindset but to be great at crocheting you have to have the technical ability, which is learned. I am having difficulty thinking of one great artist who crochets.\n\n2- You need to take her absolutely seriously. That is very important. You need to ask if it turned out the way she wanted or if there was a different plan in her mind.

You actually had to go to the bathroom for several minutes to get yourself under control. And you tried your best to make it up to your niece.  What I would recommend is that you go to see her (if you can). Share a story with her about a time when someone you really liked embarrassed you, so that she knows you understand her embarrassment. And then be gently honest. Tell her that no one makes beautiful crochet items when they are still beginners. It takes a lot of practice. And also, not everyone likes it enough to put in the required time and effort to get to a point where you are really good at something. That is why it\u2019s important to pursue the things that you really, really want to learn and to do.

Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). \n\n\nOn Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. \n\nWhen I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. \n\nMy niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, \"really ugly\" and made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nSurprisingly, all the adults was very understanding of my situation, but I feel really bad because I feel like I destroyed my niece's confidence, and I'm not sure how I can make it up to her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Say this and say it with your chest. Add ice cream afterwards if she likes that.", "Yeah, looks good on paper, but I think OP fucked it up to the point where he can't lie himself out of it without his niece looking right through it.", "I agree with this, along with the trip to Michaels.

She gave you the precious gift of a chunk of her time on earth. Shame on you!", "You need to name this little crocheted creature (LCC) and take it to various places and send your niece selfies featuring you and LCC and repeatedly let her know you appreciate the love and hard work that went into this gift.

You are supposed to be the adult.  YTA!", "My mum and dad laughed at my first attempt at sewing when I was a child. I never did it again.

My 8 year old nephew made me an extremely phallic plant pot for my birthday. It was supposed to be a cactus. If my SIL hadn\u2019t sent me a \u201cDon\u2019t laugh when you unwrap the green dick\u201d text, I probably would have ended up on the floor.

Was OP expecting realism?  Honestly, OP and his wife sound like an AH on many levels. YTA. I hope the niece continues her art and that these AH haven\u2019t killed her love for it.

Given that she had to lock herself in the washroom to get control of herself, it sounds like one of those situations, like laughing at a funeral\u2014you KNOW you\u2019re not supposed to laugh and nothing is even *that* funny, but because you\u2019re not supposed to, you end up laughing even harder. I say that because of the locking herself up AND because she feels bad and tried to recover. It\u2019s not like she opened it and laughed in niece\u2019s face like \u201cthis is what you were so excited about?

It isn't normal to laugh for minutes for a thing like that, unless you never had the basis of living in society or even just in your family.

Possibly with an apology gift of crochet patterns or pretty wool. \n\nIf you can muster enough tact and sensitivity, I think 12 is also old enough to have a convo about how to be good at something you have to be willing to be bad (or at least not instantly amazing) at it first (cut to footage of me trying to re-learn how to roller skate in my 30s, looking remarkably like a baby deer trying to walk on ice).", "YTA.

I picked it up when I\u2019d already been knitting for over ten years, and crocheting for maybe seven or eight (on and off). My first few creations were ugly (charmingly so, but still ugly), because it\u2019s hard for me to count stitches in the round like that- the reason I prefer knitting to crochet in general is that all your stitches are on your needle so you\u2019re not constantly squinting at a chain with your one little hook. \n\nAnyway, amigurimi is hard even for seasoned crafters, so for your niece to pick it up while new to crochet and make something, anything, is amazing!

That took hours of active focus. \n\nOP, do you know how many HUNDREDS of stitches go into a stuffed animal or amigurumi project?

After I started making art in my 30's, I had a flash back to helping my son with his 1st gr homework and being critical a of a giraffe he did instead of loving that adorable little scribbly 3 legged giraffe as much as I could and encouraging him to keep doing more.\n Before trying to draw things myself as an adult (and being bad at it) i  had been thinking my criticism would \"help\" him like if he had been doing math and instead it made it a negative experience that he pretty much never wanted to do again. \nAnd all my regret and trying to make up for it by encouraging him later on as a teen didn't make any (positive) difference. It's like \"cat's in the cradle \" song \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude25 thankfully he took up music and accomplished things in marching band and symphony that I could never imagine being able to do, so he found something he loved on his own.

If something catches you off guard, it can be difficult to control your reactions, no matter how little ill-intent is meant. That's just how emotional reactions work, and despite how high your emotional IQ may or may not be, those reactions can still be difficult to mitigate off the cuff.  \n\n\nHowever, I recommend some mindfulness exercises to OP if it's more difficult to control that off-the-cuff reaction after a brief moment.   \n\n\nWith that said, a little humility goes a long way. My original advice to OP is to find some of your early work for whatever your particular hobby of choice is - both as an adult and from your younger self. Show it to your niece with humility and explain that even the things that OP is good at took time and practice to learn. \n\nGo a step further. If OP isn't into crocheting, try making a small blanket or throw. It costs $10 worth of material, a five-minute YouTube video to get started, and 30 minutes to realize how bad you are at it (from personal experience). Let her see the inevitable triangle you'll make and express that you understand how talented she already is. You'll be able to fully empathize with her. \n\nI'm tacking this reply to the above comment because that advice is perfect and better than mine.

The week before christmas we have a Christmas meal and gift exchange with the families of two sisters we grew up with, who now have no contact with their biological family except each other - through everyone else being drug addicts, selfish or living overseas. We have a kind of round robin roster of which couple buys for whom, with everyone giving the kids gifts and generally the women make 'side gifts' for each couple - generally fudge or relish.\n\nThis year I made balsamic onion jam and handmade crackers. I'd been trying these recipes over the year and they were delicious,  others agreed, so I knew it was a good option. However, in the weeks before Christmas I got called in to work about 4x more than usual and I ran out of gift prep time. In the two weeks before Christmas I probably had about 7 nights where I got to bed around 2 or 3am, and my son wakes me around 6am. The night I made the crackers and onion jam (and iced a cake for the meal and 3 dozen cupcakes for gifts) I went to bed around 3:30am. My husband got home from work an hour earlier and had to help me put some supplies away because I was in agony. I have a bad back and standing for long periods is something I shouldn't do. My ankles had swollen worse than when I was pregnant and the soles of my feet hurt so bad I could barely walk. Taking weight off them when I got to bed made them hurt even worse. But I was happy, I was all ready for the lunch - and the extended family BBQ Mum had planned for dinner... and I had made gifts I knew were good.\n\nThe only problem was, I hadn't been able to process the relish to make it shelf stable, but it was small batches, enough to go with the crackers I'd made, so as long as it was popped in the fridge it would be fine. I pointed this out numerous times.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, a week later, I was at Mum's again (we live in the same town, my sister lives an hour away) and saw my sister's package still under the tree!! I was so pissed off - still am. Not only did she ignore my gift, but she wasted it. I used the last of my balsamic vinegar in this recipe and money's tight, it won't be on the grocery list for at least another month. I didn't have enough onion jam to keep some for myself - and the last jar from my previous batch, that was shelf stable and I'd been keeping for Christmas platters, I'd decanted into smaller jars and added to gift boxes for my children's teachers and the school office staff, as well as Scout leaders and priests. I had none for myself and she just left it sitting under the tree, knowing it would need to be thrown out. All she had to do was walk about 23 paces to Mum's fridge and pop it in there. Or ask someone else to do it.\n\nNext year I'm just giving her a bag of shop bought candy.", "He could have at least hugged the crochet and said that he loved it and said it \"just so cute\" while laughing.

She really can't.\"  And that was it, I literally sat there biting my cheeks and making fists of my hands and staring at the floor with my eyes tearing up and trying to make it look like anything other than hysterical laughter.

I tried to write poems growing up as a kid but I didn't get much encouragement from my family. My mom and grandma acted like you had to be an award winning author right from the start. Either you had it or didn't.\n\nSame thing with art. I wasn't good but I enjoyed doing it. Growing up in a very conservative church, I was told that God gifted us special talents so we could use them for his glory. I had it stuck in my head that God didn't \"bless\" me with creative talents so I pretty much stopped trying. \n\nI saw other girls who were more outspoken and outgoing than I was dabble into things I wasn't really comfortable with like singing, speaking, putting on plays, and Bible competitions. Everybody always put the focus on the more extroverted crowd and since I was so quiet and shy but at the same time, attractive, I just ended up being the shy, pretty girl that didn't talk much and didn't have much to offer. That really crushed my self esteem.\n\nI thought that my measly writing and crappy drawings didn't even come close to the other girls talents. I also figured God didn't bestow those gifts on to me for a reason so there was no reason to pursue those endeavors. Just another reason why I gave up on religion because all it did was cause resentment. \n\nIt didn't help that I was a serial procrastinator that pretty much gave up on projects the minute I got overwhelmed or too focused on trying to make my writing and art \"perfect.\" It wasn't until years later that I figured out that you don't have to be freaking Shakespeare to enjoy art.\n\nRecently, I've been writing, drawing, and painting a lot more than I used to.

My family isn't as bad but there are certain people I barely have a relationship with or don't have one with at all for many different reasons and not all of it was abuse but still. Some people might think that I'm just being a brat but they don't know what those people have put me through.", "Check out Hone for the Holidays on FB. It\u2019s a whole group of us. Some host for the holidays. Lots send birthday love and cards and stuff.", "And somehow his wife seems even shittier. Two peas in a pod.", "The other chap had no idea how lucky he is because my friend is an ex MMA fighter. He absolutely could have turned him into a pretzel. Luckily for him, my friend is a very sweet, gentle man who uses his wicked tongue instead of his fists.", "He actually sat there with his gob hanging open, looking gormless, then started spluttering that he didn't know. \n\nI could see my friend was getting upset so I told the chap that this is why we don't assume, because they make an ASS out of U.", "Well I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve cobbled together my own good mix of friends and acceptable family members lol. That\u2019s a great resource though. The hardest part for me was watching my kids have such a different childhood than my own without the huge ethnic celebrations but now that they\u2019re older I think they\u2019re no worse for the wear!", "It wasn't unintentional. 10 minutes is in no way unintentional", "The worst part is he *knew* she was getting him something homemade. And he knew she was 12 and just starting out at the hobby. So he had to expect it would be pretty janky looking at best. He can't chalk that shit up to shock.", "Oh my god that's so cute. I love the little half smile.", "We\u2019ve had some weird-looking things displayed in the cabinet over the years, from portraits of us that looked like dinner rolls with eyes, to clay figures with an extra leg here and there. It\u2019s the love that goes into them, you can buy perfect anywhere, but those gifts of love are irreplaceable. These two are heartless and immature.", "I learned crochet at about the same age and somehow accidentally ended up making a rat that looked a lot like the one my 4th grade teacher drew as her signature. I gave it to her as a gift and she kept it in her classroom until she retired. I was either in high school or had recently graduated at that time and at the retirement open house that the school hosted, she was excited to tell me about how she still had it. At age 10 it was awesome that she loved it so much. As a teenager/young adult, it was really interesting and meaningful to learn that she had kept it on display in her classroom for at least 7 or 8 years. \n\nI love that you are getting your swans back and can have all the memories associated with them live on whenever you see them!", "My son made an animal mug at a holiday pottery class when he was 11 - you can't drink out of it because a giraffe's head pokes you in the eye - but it's a great toothbrush holder and sits proudly in our bathroom.", "Spot on to an extent: about to turn 19 in a week. \n\nThank you so much for all that. I\u2019ll work my way into it. I\u2019ve already joined a music group thing as mentioned and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll boost my confidence a little more. My main goal is to learn to play the ukulele if I can get my hands on one. \n\nThanks again for those words. I needed that today. :)", "I do the same thing when ppl try to pressure me into talking to my mother", "Sadly, yes.", "This is the kind of behavior that may very well likely make her stop crocheting. OP is a total asshole.", "Yep, I still remember being the only 6th grader to get a C- in art class. The teacher wrote on my report card that I had \"clearly put in no effort\". The thing was I tried really freaking hard in that class. I was a driven, straight A student struggling with one class.\n\nSince my effort made no difference I quit working at anything artistic. And I still don't draw, paint, etc despite the rest of my family being super artistic.\n\nThis kid is going to remember this for the rest of her life.", "This. Internet can be a really toxic place. For a professional at this art, sure, try to sell your art online, there is a niche for almost everything. For a 12yo that is just starting? NOPE. It's a bad idea. Only ppl who know her sad backstory would buy and tell how lovely it is. The rest would flood her with bad reviews and ppl who know more about what she does would make a big message telling her how amateur her work is, how she sucks at it and would say that even for free, it still expensive. Selling online when you are a 12yo that just started to learn about something is terrible. This would break her confidence forever. And she would feel even worse that ppl who are buying and saying it's lovely are ppl who feel pity for her.", "I crochet or knit a blanket for every friend who has a baby. I've been doing it for decades so they're pretty professional, intricate and beautiful now, but when I was learning they were...not great. I was talking to a recipient of one of the not great ones the other day and she was saying how much she loved it and it still has pride of place at the end of her kids bed even though it's just decorative as her daughter is now 13. People who aren't jerks truly do appreciate the time and love that goes into making things for them. The one caveat is, is the thing you're making useful? Even though my skills were basic, it was still a perfectly functional blanket that would keep a baby warm, done in colours that looked nice together. If someone gifted me a stuffed animal, I don't know what I'd do with it since I don't collect them or have kids. If you're going to spend time making something, at least make sure it's something the gift receiver can use or wants.", "My brother once got me an umbrella making kit. And because I am weird and crafty, it was not hard for me to go, \"Oh, this is actually really cool! I use umbrellas all the time. I wonder if you can customise the fabric?\" Only for me to look closer and realise the box was actually a gag box, and you're actually not meant to like it haha. The real gift inside was some console games. So yeah, not hard to appreciate any gift, but in that case it backfired on me XD (not gonna lie though, I still would like to make a cool umbrella - most of the ones you can buy are either really boring or really expensive for anything fun).", "My friend crocheted me a blanket. I had it for 19 years and it was still as soft, perfect and vibrantly colored as the day she gave it to me. She took inspiration from my favorite painting.\nThe only reason I no longer have it is because it was my 19yo cat's favorite thing in the world and I had it cremated with him. As a cat lady who I befriended around the time I adopted him, she was honored.", "This. I'm in a group where one of the members posted a heartbreaking poem about how she left her abusive, cheating husband and all her friends could say was how shocked they were because the husband knew how to put up a good front, they were so well off and she had all the things."]}
