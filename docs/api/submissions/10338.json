People could still end up being sick the morning of, or locking their keys out of their car, or a million other reasons to miss the ceremony.

She\u2019s experienced a loss, but you are not caring about that, you are instead focused on the effects it has on you.

Mine is not the faulty logic here.", "Yeah and sounds like this is gonna be the sisters first but not last wedding so whatever", "I'm not sure what your point is.

As it is, sister was dropping out of being a bridesmaid but still going to make an appearance, albeit late, to the wedding.\n\nThe thing is, weddings tend to be longer than memorials.  Oftentimes, I think it's possible to stay for an entire memorial service and still make it to at least part of a wedding.  But it's unlikely for the reverse to be true.  The sisters' relationship is going to suffer no matter what happens--either bride is pissed her sister didn't spend all day at her wedding and as a bridesmaid (or possibly is pissed that she did but was sad the entire time) or bride get what she wants, sister puts up a good front for everyone for the day, and remembers for the rest of her life that when she was freshly grieving, her sister and family demanded she, essentially, table her grief because it was not important.  Let's face it--we don't know what will happen to the wedding/marriage in the future.  They may have many anniversaries/other events/milestones to celebrate or they may break up some time down the road.  They may have a vow renewal/second wedding or whatever.  Weddings are important, yeah, but they really only serve a purpose for the couple getting married.\n\nFunerals/memorial services, while ostensibly for the deceased, are really for the mourners.\n\nDoes it suck sister dropped out as bridesmaid and plans to miss part of the wedding?  Yeah.  But it doesn't make the sister selfish that she is mourning this fresh loss.", "that's not what a memorial service is", "She asked AITA for telling her sister she was selfish for backing out of the wedding a week ahead of time.  She didn't say anything about insisting that her sister come.  OP has a right to have and express her feelings and I completely understand why she has those feelings.  \n\nClaiming that she gave her sister some kind of ultimatum is just your made up  scenario.  I didn't see anything of that nature expressed by OP.", "I merely paraphrased what the person I was replying to said."]}
