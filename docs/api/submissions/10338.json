It\u2019s not for someone outside to say \u201cwell it\u2019s possible to mourn a different way so you have to do that.\u201d Grief needs to be respected, not pushed around.", "What part of \"offers a form of closure to the mourners\" and \"for the mourners\" don't you understand?  The OP is always going to remember that her sister wasn't at the ***entirety*** of her wedding (sister said she would be late).  Conversely, sister will always remember that OP \"made\" her miss the memorial service of a friend while she was grieving.\n\nAnd yeah, the dead guy isn't at the memorial.  He's dead, in Turkey.  Along with his daughter and six other members of his family.  What's your point?", "Or that she was close to both", "Lol she loves it to, even started using it with her daughter \ud83d\ude02", "Definitely lol", "Please do \ud83d\ude01 lol", "Read through the comments. They can both be upset but you do realize that OP is upset to not have her sister there too, it\u2019s not about party numbers. Imagine having a sibling and loving them and looking forward to sharing this with them and then a coworker dies so they\u2019re only coming for the party. That sucks and she\u2019s got a right to be upset and I honestly don\u2019t think that a friend who is just in passing at work, takes precedence over family.", "I think your empathy might be broken. You may wanna get that checked out.", "She has a right to have her feelings, and to express them to someone. Accusing someone in mourning of being selfish, likely to push them into changing their plans to suit her, goes beyond \u201cexpressing her feelings\u201d and is instead her being selfish."]}
