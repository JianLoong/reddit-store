It's your car. She can share her car with him, if she feels he's entitled to use a car he doesn't own or maintain.\n\nIs the favouritism a normal thing, or does she just not want the hassle of having her son nag her? Either this is crppy parenting.", "NTA. It's YOUR car. You bought it. You don't want anything to happen to it. Let your stepmum lend him her car. Or, he can save up for his own.", "NTA OP and if step mom/brother try to give you any crap about it again, feel free to provide these arguments\n\n1. It is your car that you paid for entirely yourself with your own money. They should respect your opinion on who can and can't drive the car.\n2. INSURANCE!!!! If you pay your own auto insurance, then you should know that auto insurance follows a car not just a driver. If your step bro gets in an accident while driving your car even if its not his fault, you will very likely be the one on the hook for the increase in auto insurance costs you have to pay.\n3. His friends are not your friends and there is simply no guarantee that they will treat your car with the respect it deserves. As a former 17 year old man myself, we do not always treat things with care.\n4. Ask why he can't borrow either step-mom's or your dad's car to go hangout with friends. If their answer is something like \"we need to use ours and you won't be going anywhere\" then tell them they can take your car and step bro can take the parent's car. That way everyone wins. You feel at ease knowing a responsible adult is driving your car, your step-bro gets to drive with his friends, and your parent(s) still get to drive wherever they need to go using your car.", "NTA its VERY clear, your step-bro could have done the same thing with his money but he decided to use it (which is fine) but because you did the right thing and saved the money to buy a car doesnt mean he gets any kind of access to it, your step-mum could have used this to teach him responsibility", "NTA, its your money now, he chose to fuck around with friends, you chose to save\n\nits your car, your decisions", "NTA. Especially if he isn't on your insurance. He's a liability if he isn't. Also, he doesn't deserve the fruit of your choice to save while he spent.", "NTA. I\u2019m an adult, and I never allow anyone to use my car. Why? Because the last time I did, they left the sunroof open and it rained. The interior was wrecked, and they refused to pay for any of it.\n\nLikewise, there\u2019s always the fact that anyone who drives your car who is not insured on it could result in a huge cost on your part if they get in an accident. You won\u2019t be able to force them to pay either, since your agreement to loan the car to them is effectively you taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nYour brother unfortunately isn\u2019t likely to understand any of this for years of course, until he saves up and buys his own car. But you should still lay it all out for him\u2014 tell him that it\u2019s nothing against him, but you aren\u2019t comfortable allowing him (or anyone else really) borrowing the car you worked hard to save up for. Then, stand strong on that. You could even offer a compromise\u2014 to go drop him off somewhere, but make it clear that he will not be driving your car.", "NTA\n\nUnless you added your stepbrother to your insurance, depending upon where you live.

Make her SHARE, because I WAAAAAANT her to!\" \n\nYou have no hope of \"settling this like adults\" when your stepbrother is behaving like a two-year-old crying for another kids' Hot Wheels car and your stepmother is stomping her feet and pouting because her stepchild has something her own child wants and won't hand it over just because Golden Child wants it.", "You bought it with your own money?

What wouldnt be fair is if you had to share a car that you paid for entirely with somebody that did not contribute a dime.", "NTA, but I wouldn't put it past him or your stepmom to attempt to override any decision you make and try to take it during an opportune moment.

If you didn't have the car then what would he do then? Would it not be make alternative arrangements?\n\nIf you do say yes draft a contract up and have both parents sign it at witnesses. Then if anything happens to the car he has to take responsibility for it and can't go back on on his word as he signed the contract.", "You are NTA however your step mom brother and father are , he enjoyed his money how he wanted to , now you can enjoy your money you earned in your way , by having a car.

Your stepmother is an a$$ for not using this opportunity to teach her son about delayed gratification.  Your dad is an A$$ for the \"settle it like adults\" comment.  That is a very manipulative statement because it implies that if you don't share your car with your SB, you're acting like a child.  Most adults don't loan out their cars to other people, even family or friends.  It's a really unwise thing to do.", "Settle it like adults?  If one adult asks another adult to borrow their car and the person says no - then that adult needs to accept that no because they have no right to someone else's car.
