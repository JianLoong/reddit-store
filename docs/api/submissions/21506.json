{"id": 21506, "submission_id": "14sib9t", "title": "AITA for bathing my drunk daughter?", "selftext": "Hello Reddit. I'm 42 years old and my wife is 49, she has a biological daughter who was little when we got married and I legally adopted her, who is now 20. Last weekend she went to a bar with her boyfriend and some friends. She said she would be late and they would bring her back, so my wife and I had a good night and went to bed early. My wife takes sleeping pills, so I answered her phone when it rang several times around 2 in the morning. Our daughter was crying on the phone and obviously drunk (for my American friends, the drinking age in this country is 18). She begged me to come get her because everyone had left her there. So I got dressed up, got in my car and drove over.\n\nShe was very drunk, so I put her in the back seat. She was crying, still drinking and talking about her boyfriend. I don't know what happened, but I know a bad breakup when I see one. Eventually she vomited all over the back seat and herself. It was a mess, but I just waited until we got home. I had to drag her into the house, her dress was ruined and it looked like she couldn't hold her bladder. I couldn't let her sleep like that, so I undressed her, put her in the bathtub and washed her body with a body sponge (I don't know if they call them that in English). She slowly regained consciousness while I was bathing her, so I reassured her that everything was okay, she was home, and everything was going to be all right. But then when I finished bathing her and tried to get her up, she started screaming at me and pushing me away, so she slipped and fell on the floor screaming for her mom. I tried to calm her down, but my wife finally woke up, saw us in the bathroom, and in retrospect, it wasn't a good look at all. \n\nMy wife assumed the worst case scenario you can imagine and started screaming at me and our daughter didn't help at all because she was still kind of drunk, confused and screaming too. My wife told me to get my stuff and get out of the house, so I did.\n\nI stayed in a hotel for a few days until my in-laws called me. I explained the whole story and they believed me and tried to mediate with my wife, but she doesn't believe me and our daughter doesn't even remember calling me, so we are in an awkward position. However, my in-laws have allowed me to stay with them until we work things out, but we haven't made any progress.\n\nSo, to ask a very specific question: \u00bfWas I wrong to undress and bathe my daughter while she was blackout drunk? \u00bfWas that a bad move? I was just trying to help her, but it was misinterpreted in the worst possible way.", "created_utc": 1688669783, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sib9t/aita_for_bathing_my_drunk_daughter/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter was too drunk to consent to being undressed and bathed by you, so it NEVER should have happened.  \n\nI was a Resident Advisor in college.  It was my job to see to it that residents who were too drunk were safe until they were able to sleep it off.  I never undressed nor bathed a single one.  It wasn't necessary.  I got them back to their rooms and made sure they were safe.  Put a water or gatorade out for them if I could.  If they had to do laundry the next morning because they passed out in gross clothes, that was their business.  It wasn't a safety issue.

You could have helped her get cleaned up without undressing her, or more importantly, you should have helped sober her up and let her clean herself.

But if this is honestly explained I feel bad for you. But, the fact your wife automatically assumed the worse, and didn\u2019t wait and explain, that is a bit strange. To me, at least. So you were in the wrong, no doubt. She didn\u2019t need to be bathed.

You don\u2019t undress unconscious people whether related to them or not.", "YTA\n\nYou may have had the best intentions, although I don't know what those may have been since your story makes you sound pretty creepy, but you should have known how wrong that was.

Biological daughter or adoptive its not ok unless she can consent to your \"help\" which was honestly not necessary.

She's drunk and maybe doesn't know where she is or what's going on. But it's odd to me that your wife would jump to think the worst case scenario at the same time f it's odd that you thought a bath was so pressing. You definitely need to apologize to your daughter.

This is a big old WTF and you deserve all the negative speculation about it.", "This is just a mess. It seems like you defaulted into treating her like a 4 year old little girl, which is a bit messed up.

Then left *her* to deal with getting the rest of the vomit (and piss?) off herself unless she specifically asked for help.

You have to be weary around kids and women because people will always assume the worst intentions. Sad, but it\u2019s just an overlooked form of sexism and just the world we live in.

And yes it was intimate, everyone other than you perceived it that way.", "You just admitted your wife can wake up if you try. \n\nWHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE YOUR WIFE UP? \n\n Your default was, oh hey, I'll just get my TWENTY YEAR OLD STEPDAUGHTER  naked and bathe her?\n\nJFC", "As I said before, there was no reason to sponger her down. A dip in the bath was MORE than enough in this situation.", "Her version of the story is that she was undressed and bathed by hand without her consent.  Right?", "What is her version that she could even tell. That she called her father to pick her up but instead he decided to give her a full body bath while she passed out ? It doesn\u2019t look good from any angle", "See it\u2019s very weird to me that with the phones to back up she called you, along with the car full of piss and vomit, there shouldn\u2019t be reason to doubt your wife to doubt your story. Something feels like it\u2019s missing.", "No you did not have to undress her.  You needed to put her in bed, fully clothed.  The more you respond the more I think you need to go to jail.", "I\u2019m not convinced he wasn\u2019t just wiping her down and everyone is reading too much into his use of the word \u201csponge,\u201d especially since English isn\u2019t his first language.", "Yeah, a quick shower with their clothes on is the best move if OP was determined to clean her up. Then let her sleep in the tub (empty tub of course)\n\nEdit: spelling", "As an American, you nailed it. Family dynamics here are weird. I was raised by immigrants and I see the difference anytime I read these subs just like you.", "You would bathe your 20 year old kid by hand with a sponge while they were too drunk to consent?  That is a huge invasion of their privacy.", "Pissing yourself while drunk is far ER status. She was so drunk she may have thought she was in a place that it was ok to pee. Like the time some drunk person wandered into my roommates room and used her chair thinking they were in a bathroom", "If either of my biological parents did this I would find it distressing. People don't die from sleeping in a puked on dress. Help her use the bathroom and leave her to sleep it off.", "She is an adult woman, being stripped naked while unconscious and bathed. There is no way that this is anything but an assault.", "Ok...do you really think that no father ever molested their own daughter? Or in this case, step father?", "She might not because you didn't need to do it. I get that she's your daughter but she's 20. A 20 year old doesn't want their parent touching them naked. She's not bedridden. I don't know why you thought a bath was anywhere near the top of the priority list.\n\nI've helped drunk friends before. People who weren't passed out I've even gotten clothes for but I have not actually stripped them naked. No need to.", "Thinking someone is dying because they're in the hospital is far different from her thinking that you are molesting her drunk daughter while she (that being your wife) sleeps because she literally woke up to her daughter screaming naked in a bath with you standing over her.", "Nobody is harmed by going to bed with some puke on them.  Undressing and bathing a grown woman.  NO.", "What if the mom had given her a bath?", "A spray of cold water in the face while she\u2019s dressed and sitting in the tub is sufficient.", "essentially yes. She was drinking at the bar after being left alone and suddenly she is in the bath while I was washing her, that's all she can remember.", "I feel like the calls and car don't matter when a grown woman is undressed and given a sponge bath without having consented. There is zero reason that had to happen.", "Yeah. What else was he supposed to use, his hand? \n\nLots of times you have to actually wipe gunk off. Water alone wont do it", "My friends did that to me when I was so drunk I shat myself and passed out. I sure as hell didn\u2019t wipe my own ass in that shower. I did not feel like my privacy was invaded and I can\u2019t imagine the kind of rash I\u2019d have the next day if they let it sit there all night!", "She's 20, but it was still a bad move.", "[deleted]", "A spray of *cold* water in the face while she\u2019s dressed and sitting in the tub is *sufficient*.\n\nYou misspelled *cruel*. Spraying someone that\u2019s incoherent in the face with cold water can cause shock. Don\u2019t be an asshole.", "Only the bath matters.  I want you to understand this.  You undressed and bathed an adult woman without her consent.  Where I live this is illegal, as it should be.  At the very least, the VERY least, it is a gross invasion of privacy.  You should never have done this.  She should have been put in bed to sleep it off.", "Yeah and I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s inherently bad when the other option is leaving piss and vomit to fester on their body.", "My bad."]}
