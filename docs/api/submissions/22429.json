Loaded him and his gear in his wheelchair, found a seat, and ordered using the \"table service\" option.   At least a half dozen times I've done this when I have to go out with both kids by myself.  It is difficult to get his wheelchair set just right so that he sits up to the table and I still get nervous with him out of my sight for even a few moments as he gets nearly 24 hour care with the only break being sleeping in a padded bed that is alarmed.\n\nOnly one other time they brought my food without the drinks but they quickly apologized and brought them out.  \n\nThis time however the girl (18-20?) brings out my food and only my kids drinks and no straws.   I tried to be polite as I could and said \"excuse me but I think I'm missing a drink and straws\".  She immediately snapped back \"We don't get drinks\".  I asked \"you can't help me?\" and motioned to my 6yo who's already trying to get into her food and my 5yo who's now realized there's food and has started awkwardly trying to grab his food.  She just rolled her eyes and huffed.  I said, annoyed \"fine\".  Grabbed my cup from the nearby counter, walked over, filled it, and rushed back to the table. \n\nAs I'm doing this she half asked what I ordered. At this point the manager takes notice and comes over.  I laid out what happened.  The manager (F) looked horrified, apologized, then took the girl into the back and was loudly reaming her although I couldn't make it what was said.\n\nI don't normally ask for much help but having to choose between carrying drinks while pushing a wheelchair or leaving my son is area where it is kinda tough. Also I just don't understand the point of offering a table service option if the customer still has to serve themselves.", "created_utc": 1689541708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151hoyu/aita_for_likely_getting_a_girl_fired/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked for feedback by a manager and you gave it objectively. The girl may not have been fired per se, but put on performance management and/or written up. Hopefully, she takes the lesson to heart and corrects her behaviour. If not, she will quickly learn actions have consequences.", "NTA you didnt get her fired. You told her boss your interaction.

Half these teens and earlier 20 year old have no class, no manners and have had everything handed to them. The manager probably could have not reamed her ass for it, but firing her was a great, and the only, option.
