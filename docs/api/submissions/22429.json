Loaded him and his gear in his wheelchair, found a seat, and ordered using the \"table service\" option.   At least a half dozen times I've done this when I have to go out with both kids by myself.  It is difficult to get his wheelchair set just right so that he sits up to the table and I still get nervous with him out of my sight for even a few moments as he gets nearly 24 hour care with the only break being sleeping in a padded bed that is alarmed.\n\nOnly one other time they brought my food without the drinks but they quickly apologized and brought them out.  \n\nThis time however the girl (18-20?) brings out my food and only my kids drinks and no straws.   I tried to be polite as I could and said \"excuse me but I think I'm missing a drink and straws\".  She immediately snapped back \"We don't get drinks\".  I asked \"you can't help me?\" and motioned to my 6yo who's already trying to get into her food and my 5yo who's now realized there's food and has started awkwardly trying to grab his food.  She just rolled her eyes and huffed.  I said, annoyed \"fine\".  Grabbed my cup from the nearby counter, walked over, filled it, and rushed back to the table. \n\nAs I'm doing this she half asked what I ordered. At this point the manager takes notice and comes over.  I laid out what happened.  The manager (F) looked horrified, apologized, then took the girl into the back and was loudly reaming her although I couldn't make it what was said.\n\nI don't normally ask for much help but having to choose between carrying drinks while pushing a wheelchair or leaving my son is area where it is kinda tough.

If I were that supervisor or manager, I would've fired her on the spot without a warning.\nAlso I agree with other comments about how you handled the situation by speaking with manager, so know you didn't get her probably fired, she got herself fired.", "The fact that the manager was keeping an eye on her probably indicates laziness and rudeness have landed her in trouble already.

Is it bottomless soda in McD's where you live? If not what could possibly possess them to create that kind of liability nightmare?
