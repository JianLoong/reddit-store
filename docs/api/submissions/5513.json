My parents never got married so when my dad died in a car accident when I was 3, everything went to me as his only child and not to my mom.  It was a lot, my dad was very well off. I was too young to really understand what was happening but there was a lot of family drama around it and my grandparents were put in charge of managing my trust instead of my mom.  This also included the house I grew up in, so I always had a vague awareness that there was a lot of tension between my mom, me, and my grandparents but didn\u2019t know why until I was starting to get ready for college last year and my grandparents explained the financial situation.  My mom remarried when I was 9, but I\u2019ve never warmed up to my step-father and step-brothers (23 & 21).  I just always got a \u201cvibe\u201d off of them that made me want to pull away, it\u2019s hard to describe.  I didn\u2019t cause trouble, just kept them at a distance, which I know has always bothered them.\n\nAnyway, I came back home for Christmas yesterday and I\u2019m staying with my grandparents. I know the step-brothers will be staying over at my mom and stepdad\u2019s and this way the house won\u2019t be crowded and I can have space.  I did the same last Christmas. I went over to see my mom this evening and I could tell there was a mood. My mom asked if I wanted to stay over in my room and I said no thanks. That set off one of my step-brothers, who said it wouldn\u2019t kill me to spend the night since I never come home anymore.  It turned into an argument and my step-dad said that they just wanted the whole family together and I told him that their family was together already, they and my mom are a family and that\u2019s fine, but that they aren\u2019t my family and everyone is old enough to admit that now.  My step-dad got upset and my mom said that was cruel because he loves me. I said I don\u2019t feel the same, and I feel like they want something from me that\u2019s not going to happen. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get along. I just want space for awhile and I\u2019m going to take it one way or another, so we can figure out what everyone can live with or things can get a lot less pleasant. They all got quiet and then changed the subject, but my oldest step-brother caught me outside and told me it was a real AH move to throw my weight around because I\u2019m better off than the rest of them and make the parents afraid about their living situation if they don\u2019t humor my AH-ness.  I\u2019ve gotten texts from both of them telling me that I need to apologize and their dad has been way better to me than I deserve.\n\nThe housing situation never crossed my mind, I just meant I would go NC for awhile. I know what I said was hard to hear, but it\u2019s how I really feel and now I wonder if it hard because they feel like they have to keep me connected financially.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671872260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu5y6s/aita_for_telling_my_stepfamily_the_truth_that_i/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's going to happen when people can't just leave shit alone.", "NTA initially, but so the question becomes: are you afraid they are money grubbers or have they ever actually asked you for any money?", "NTA, like you said, you never even brought up money or the house, and yet that\u2019s the first thing their minds went to. It\u2019s pretty clear why you don\u2019t feel welcome in that house, and I honestly think it\u2019s very telling that you feel more comfortable around your grandparents than your mom and step \u201cfamily\u201d.\n\nBtw \u201ctheir dad has been way better to me than I deserve\u201d that\u2019s not a medal.

I\u2019m not sure your parents/step parents have done anything wrong and I think you\u2019re step brothers are just looking out for the dad.  I actually think that you could do with some family counselling to come to terms with everything.", "NTA,  they're not that worried about an actual relationship with you, they are mostly worried that they'll be homeless. Why didn't they move in to step dad's home when they married?", "NTA you need to have a real talk with your grandparents about the whole situation. It is and has obviously affected your relationship with your mom and step family. You really need to know about the house and what kind of deal there is with it. I do think your mom and stepdad should have bought their own house and moved out of the house involved in your trust.", "NTA and i'm confused. If they are so afraid and feel pressured like your SB said why didn't they move to another apartment/house already? They need to have a ton of money set aside since they are living in your house for free as far as i understand - and this for about 20 yrs now.... So they should be extremly well off by now. So what is their problem?", "NTA - you step brothers are. Your mom and step dad can feel whatever they feel but it\u2019s on them to manage those feelings. You werent threatening their housing but it sounds like they may be worried and/or step brothers are looking to cash in which may need to be addressed directly with your mom at some point but not right now. You weren\u2019t an ahole", "NTA. If you don't want to stay there then don't. I suppose you need to think about how you want to handle the situation with the house.

And i dont know what went on? But if your mother got nothing from your fathers estate? Thats appalling.", "The inheritance money made you believe that everyone around you show love to you for your money. That\u2019s kinda sad because you don\u2019t know what actual love is like! It was sad that you lost your father early but also your mother deserves to live her own life and she did not abandon you.", "YTA. Idk about the money situation, that sounds pretty complicated. But you shouldn\u2019t have said that you weren\u2019t really family.\n\nI totally get your reasoning and where you\u2019re coming from about your step-family. I (18m) feel the same about mine. \u2026 I don\u2019t think you were right to say that out loud though. Just because something is true, doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said, you know?\n\nLike when my mom picked me up from college for break last week, she asked if I missed her. I didn\u2019t, but I told her I did because what would I gain out of being honest and upfront about that?\n\n\nYou could\u2019ve explained why didn\u2019t want the stay the night in a different way. I always just say I don\u2019t wanna move all my stuff. \n\n\n>but that they aren\u2019t my family and everyone is old enough to admit that now. \n\nEveryone being on the same page but just not addressing it may appear like reality to you, but it could easily not be the case. Your mom most likely does genuinely believe y\u2019all are all a family, and maybe even your step family a bit. If they arnt *your* family, then that\u2019s okay. But be prepared for them not to feel the same way. Especially from your moms perspective, because even if she has noticed some of the distance that you were talking about stuff, it\u2019s very likely that she *wants* y\u2019all to all be a family. And I\u2019m not saying that you should try to be a family and do stuff you don\u2019t want to. \n\nBut you certainly didn\u2019t have to be so emotionally brutal about the whole situation. There\u2019s a good chance that your mom and step-dad don\u2019t feel so cut and dry about the family dynamic as you do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
