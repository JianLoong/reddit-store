My parents never got married so when my dad died in a car accident when I was 3, everything went to me as his only child and not to my mom.  It was a lot, my dad was very well off. I was too young to really understand what was happening but there was a lot of family drama around it and my grandparents were put in charge of managing my trust instead of my mom.  This also included the house I grew up in, so I always had a vague awareness that there was a lot of tension between my mom, me, and my grandparents but didn\u2019t know why until I was starting to get ready for college last year and my grandparents explained the financial situation.  My mom remarried when I was 9, but I\u2019ve never warmed up to my step-father and step-brothers (23 & 21).  I just always got a \u201cvibe\u201d off of them that made me want to pull away, it\u2019s hard to describe.  I didn\u2019t cause trouble, just kept them at a distance, which I know has always bothered them.\n\nAnyway, I came back home for Christmas yesterday and I\u2019m staying with my grandparents. I know the step-brothers will be staying over at my mom and stepdad\u2019s and this way the house won\u2019t be crowded and I can have space.  I did the same last Christmas. I went over to see my mom this evening and I could tell there was a mood. My mom asked if I wanted to stay over in my room and I said no thanks. That set off one of my step-brothers, who said it wouldn\u2019t kill me to spend the night since I never come home anymore.  It turned into an argument and my step-dad said that they just wanted the whole family together and I told him that their family was together already, they and my mom are a family and that\u2019s fine, but that they aren\u2019t my family and everyone is old enough to admit that now.  My step-dad got upset and my mom said that was cruel because he loves me. I said I don\u2019t feel the same, and I feel like they want something from me that\u2019s not going to happen. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get along. I just want space for awhile and I\u2019m going to take it one way or another, so we can figure out what everyone can live with or things can get a lot less pleasant. They all got quiet and then changed the subject, but my oldest step-brother caught me outside and told me it was a real AH move to throw my weight around because I\u2019m better off than the rest of them and make the parents afraid about their living situation if they don\u2019t humor my AH-ness.  I\u2019ve gotten texts from both of them telling me that I need to apologize and their dad has been way better to me than I deserve.\n\nThe housing situation never crossed my mind, I just meant I would go NC for awhile. I know what I said was hard to hear, but it\u2019s how I really feel and now I wonder if it hard because they feel like they have to keep me connected financially.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671872260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu5y6s/aita_for_telling_my_stepfamily_the_truth_that_i/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom most likely does genuinely believe y\u2019all are all a family, and maybe even your step family a bit. If they arnt *your* family, then that\u2019s okay. But be prepared for them not to feel the same way. Especially from your moms perspective, because even if she has noticed some of the distance that you were talking about stuff, it\u2019s very likely that she *wants* y\u2019all to all be a family. And I\u2019m not saying that you should try to be a family and do stuff you don\u2019t want to. \n\nBut you certainly didn\u2019t have to be so emotionally brutal about the whole situation.

What to others might be fairly normal Stepfamily distance when a family doesn't blend can turn into walking on eggshells if he can toss them out.\n\nThey should have been planning on having to move from Day 1 if that is in fact the situation.  If OP stays local, they might want and/or need the home eventually once they have a spouse, especially if they plan on children of their own.\n\nOP, I'd talk to your Dad's estate planner.  Do they get rights if they're there a certain length of time after you turned 18?  Do you plan on letting Mom and Stepdad stay there for life and then give Stepsibs first dibs at buying?  Does Stepdad have to go if Mom predeceases him because he's only there due to being her husband?  What happens if that's your plan, but life happens and you need the house yourself before their deaths?  All of this needs to be discussed.  They need a rough timeline about when they'll have to vacate, and warning about what circumstances would change that sooner than they planned.\n\nWhatever you decide, make sure no situation arises that your Stepsiblings would have rights to any of the profits from a house sale.  Estate attorney - none of us can advise you about that.", "I'd thought initially that it was a miscommunication, but that puts a whole new spin on things.", "The lawyers are there to interpret the law. This is why lawyers exist, and this why good lawyers make a lot of money. \n\nWe have limited information here but you could really easily make a case for the opposite than what you are claiming. This is a very delicate situation if you have a mother who lost a partner in an accident, so the house owner is dead and cannot protect his partner from loosing her place to live. The kid who inherits the house and the money seems to be manipulating his family because of that. From what OP explains, his mother did not appear out of nowhere now, she raised OP and provided for him. \n\nOf course, if you have a possibility, you can F uck your family over and live alone in your house because it's legally yours. Is it right or moral thing to do? Not so much imho.", "Or they could want their kid/brother around. He\u2019s right to not do it if he doesn\u2019t want to. But assuming the e initial invite had an ulterior motive is jumping to conclusions.", "Why would mom get anything she could live rent free and her child's trust would have provided support.  They were never married.", ">This is a very delicate situation if you have a mother who lost a partner in an accident, so the house owner is dead and cannot protect his partner from loosing her place to live.\n\nThat assumes that the house owner would have wanted the house to go to his partner rather than to his child. If that was the case, it\u2019s up to the house owner to make a will that leaves the house to his partner.\n\nIf the house is willed to the child or the child inherits under intestacy laws, the mother is provided with housing while she is raising the child. The mother can also be paid state benefits to support the child, and if there is money in trust for the child, it can be used to pay the child\u2019s expenses.\n\nLawyers can interpret the law, but they can\u2019t change the law to benefit their client.\n\nIreland had a case some years back where a case was taken on behalf of a young child on the grounds that that child had not been properly provided for when her father died. The child\u2019s father was married and had five other children. He died intestate so assets held jointly with his wife passed to his wife, and his estate passed according to intestacy law; two thirds to his wife and the remaining third divided equally among his children. It worked out to several thousand Euros for each child. Not much to raise a young child to adulthood. There is provision in law that allows a parent\u2019s will to be challenged on the grounds that it did not make proper provision for the child. Lawyers could argue that the child in that case was not properly provided for but they couldn\u2019t change the law so that it applied to intestate parents as well as to testate parents.\n\nIt\u2019s up to people to do their research, and decide accordingly.\n\nFor example, in Ireland, there is no tax on bequests between a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership. There will be tax on bequests between a couple who do not have these legal ties. If you want to pass assets to a partner tax free, you need to marry them.\n\nIn my case, under intestacy succession, my assets would be divided equally between my parents (divorced). If I wanted my siblings or cousins or godchild to inherit instead, I\u2019d need to make a will. If I wanted to leave everything to one parent, or to leave an unequal distribution between them, I\u2019d need to make a will. If I wanted a friend to inherit, I\u2019d need to make a will. If I wanted my assets to go to charity, I\u2019d need to make a will. If I wanted anything other than the exact division prescribed by intestate succession, I\u2019d need to make a will.\n\nIt\u2019s my job to (a) know what the law is, and (b) to take the necessary steps if I don\u2019t want my estate divided according to intestate succession."]}
