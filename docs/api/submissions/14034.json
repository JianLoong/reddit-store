Everyone in our family owns multiple quilts made by her. Unfortunately, as she got older, she lost her ability to see and had to give up her hobby. She has many completed quilt tops that she expressed wanting to have finished one day. However, they remain unfinished and have been sitting in storage for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, I (34F) am a small clothing designer, focusing on upcycled materials and handmade designs. Several years ago I asked grandma if I could have her fabric supply to make clothing. She gave me a lot of scraps and unused material but did not want to give me the quilt tops.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom has been slowly helping grandma clean out her house in preparation for the inevitable. Recently, my mom returned from visiting grandma and gifted me 12 quilt tops. I want to turn these into cardigans and sweaters, to both sell and give away to relatives, but I am conflicted as I know grandma intended to have these quilts completed. From what I understand it costs $300-$500 to complete a quilt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould I be the AH if I made the quilt tops into clothing? I can't really ask my grandma because she lives far away and can no longer talk on the phone or text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for your feedback. The main thing I took away is that I need to have more communication with everyone involved. I called both my mom and my aunt to get more details. As I said in the original post, grandma is incapable of talking on the phone. A few things I learned after talking to both my mom and aunt: \n\n1.) Grandma has 40+ quilts set aside for family members and potential future family members. \n\n2.) All grandma's quilting machines and supplies were gifted by her to my cousins that live locally. \n\n3.) Those cousins were made aware of the unfinished quilt tops and chose not to take on those projects.\n\n 4.) Grandma was shown a picture of the patchwork dress I made with the scraps she gave me several years ago and really liked it.\n\nI know this is not the explicit \"go ahead\", and I will take no action until I get the ok from grandma (I asked my aunt to talk to her, I won't be able to visit for several months).

Moreover, you're not doing it exclusively to honor her, you're doing it (at least in part) to sell the clothes you make.\n\nIf you can sew clothes, you can sew a quilt--including by doing simple straight stitch machine quilting yourself. You could upcycle a bedsheet for the quilt back and get some batting on sale. The $300 to $500 price you quoted is only if you send out the quilt for professional long-arm quilting and, even then, the price seems high.  Point is, if you really want to honor grandma, use your talents to finish these projects the way she wanted, not turn them into something else.", "YTA\n\nIf you can sew, finish the quilts yourself.

If you don't want them, you can give them to your other relatives. I think it's disrespectful to ignore her wishes.\n\nIf you really want to, you can wait and ask her again if you have the chance, but I don't think you should outright ignore her answer, that she has already given you.

If you aren't interested in finishing them, find family member who would want them, either as they are or to have finished. If you want to make clothing from quilt tops, make your own. Your grandma gave her answer when she wouldn't give them to you before, so unless you ask now and get a different answer (that she's actually cognitively able to give) then you would be worse than an AH. The quilt tops should be treasured heirlooms and depending on where you are and what you're looking for as far as finishing goes, you can get them finished for less than what you've mention. If nothing else, look up tack quilting, it's pretty damn easy to do yourself and would maintain them as the quilts she intended.", "You know this was done by Ralph Lauren and there was a strong negative reaction afterwards, right?  It was considered tantamount to cutting up American history.  A classy move would be to finish the quilts and give them to family members at baby showers. \nYou can get cheap machine made quilts at goodwill and the like.  Try using those for your fashion projects instead.", "YTA.\n\nFind someone who would finish the quilts.

There must be some way you can communicate with her.  Whether you're mum 'gave' them to you is irrelevant - Grandma gets final say in what happens to them. \nIf the worst happens and she passes away before you can ask her, you gotta have a family round table and layout your ideas first. They are precious, irreplaceable family heirlooms with much more sentimental value than any brought item could have, so as such it must be agreed before anyone does what some may perceive as irreparable damage.

You know your grandma didn't want them made into clothes. Ideally, you would finish the quilts. But, if you can't do that, and your relatives agree, making them into clothes could be seen as an acceptable way to pass on your grandma's legacy. If you just flat out made them into clothes and sold them? No.", "Please get photos of the tops, especially if you are going to cut them up.", "NTA, do ask your family that lives close to your grandmother if they want any of the quilt tops your mother gave you.  Before you do anything with the quilt tops, ask your family how many quilts does one person really need?  If someone wants them, go ahead and let them finish them and display them in their home.  If no one wants them, do something with them that you will enjoy.   I'm a quilter, so I know what is involved in making a quilt, I also understand the issue of inheriting quilts and tops.    My grandmother was a quilter too, she died in 1972!  My grandfather remarried a year later and Mom thought step grandmother had disposed of Granny's stuff.   My grandparents had moved about 2  years before Granny died and apparently the quilts and tops had been packed in a wooden chest for the move, then put in the attic for storage.  Mom sold the house about 1997 and we found the quilts.  There are over 25 quilts and unfinished tops.  Those unfinished tops are doing no one any good at all, they aren't really very valuable to collectors, and I love the idea of making something wearable from them.", "Are these 12 quilt tops all of the unfinished quilts or did you mom give them out to various family members? What happens to these quilt tops if you don't make them into clothes? Would your family be mad if you made the quilts into clothes? Will anyone pay to have the quilts finished if you do nothing?\n\nIt's a tragedy that your grandma couldn't finish the quilts, but it's a waste if they all just sit unfinished in a closet.  I think it's important you don't upset your grandma while she's alive or offend your family by your actions.  BUT assuming your family is ok with using the quilt tops that way and that your grandma isn't hurt in the process, I don't think it makes you a good or bad person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But have you thought about offering to make them into clothes *for* Grandma? She might like the idea of wearing her quilts more than she likes the idea of you selling clothes made from them. If she says okay, you can use one or two and make her some great stuff, and then maybe she likes the idea and lets you go nuts with the rest.

Honestly, you are probably going to get a very mixed response here and rightly so. Each quilt has a story or a reason for existing. They were all made with love and care. Some people would be very happy that you were inspired by their work. Others would be very upset to see their works cut apart. \n\nI can not speak for your grandmother. None of us can as we don\u2019t know her. The fact that she did not give you the quilt tops earlier makes me lean in the direction of, \u201cshe would not appreciate that\u201d but I am not sure. \n\nI do however have an idea and an opinion. Make a jacket for your grandma out of the tops. Tell her that you wanted to giver her something to repay her for all the kind things she has done for you. Quilted jackets are the most common form of quilted clothing so I think it would be very appropriate. From there you can gage her reaction to see if it would be okay to do more. However, if you do make more, I wouldn\u2019t sell them. These are the last things that she will probably ever make. They would probably be best as gifts to family and friends.

Since she has so many, I think this may be the best option overall, and they may even be able to oblige with some pictures or thank yous of the quilts with their happy new owners for you to pass along to your grandma to enjoy.\n\nA cheaper option for finishing them would be using the \"birthing\" or \"pillowcase\" method, and then doing yarn ties. SO much faster and cheaper, no messing around with binding, and no special sewing machines are needed. There are many YouTubes on how to do this.

Where I am, which I will admit is a low cost of living area, you can get long arm quilting and finishing for around $150, and that's with only supplying the quilt top. Very good, experienced quilters usually start at about $250 with you supplying everything. As you mentioned, it's possible to roll most quilts and straight line sew them on a home machine, or use fleece as a backing and batting in one and tack quilt it. There's tons of options, but OOP just seems to want to hack up their grandma's hard work and sell it. It's obvious they have no clue how much work and love goes into one.

I upcycle clothing as well and I LOVE quilted pieces.

Talk to family - agree what can be cut up, & for what purpose. \n\nBest case:  Hopefully some of your family will be thrilled at the idea of having a coat or whatnot made from grandma's quilt (I would be).
