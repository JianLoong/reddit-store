I told this to my wife at around 10am because she had been planning on taking them to an outdoor event while at her mother\u2019s. I said not to and that it could wait for another day. Later on in the day I notice her location is the exact place this event is at. She had our 3 and 1 year old out at this event in harmful air quality. When I confronted her, she said \u201cwell our son really wanted to go.\u201d I honest to god was just speechless. I couldn\u2019t believe that she disregarded warnings that this air quality could have short and long term effects on our kids. We had plenty of health issues with our son so that\u2019s why I was so angry. And what\u2019s worse is she snuck off about it, had I not noticed the location change then I wouldn\u2019t have even known. I yelled at her and told her that I was just disgusted at the disregard for our kids\u2019 health. AITA?\n\nEdit: Because this is getting nitpicked, there was an agreement to keep the kids inside. Nothing I said was an order. Please do not assume. Sorry if the language implied something different.\n\nEdit 2: I didn\u2019t think I had to mention this but because I\u2019m now getting shouted at and insulted, *I do not track or control my wife\u2019s location.* We share our locations because I used to work a job that had me on the road constantly and accidents happen.

Not by a long shot. I live in Canada where the air quality was recently very poor. I'm a grown-ass 26yo man and I was having a hard time breathing outside in that. It gets physically painful to breathe after only about 10-15 minutes. I can't imagine how that would be for a child and I would absolutely never let a little kid out in that air quality.

The fact is that warnings were put out to keep kids inside, she did not do so. It\u2019s that simple.

That should have been that. I am also in the effected area and air quality was *awful*. I mean it\u2019s bad enough that outdoor concerts are being cancelled, and that\u2019s because of how dangerous it would be for *adults* to be exposed to this air quality.

Absolutely horrifying that your wife exposed the two young kids to that for no real reason at all.", "NTA \n\nShe apparently doesn't have much common sense and she's the AH.

Wildfire smoke is so full of particulates and carcinogens that can damage a child's lungs and windpipe.

Lung damage sustained in infancy can be life-threatening and/or permanent.\n\nAlso hiding behind what the 3yo \"wants\" is such total garbage she should have been embarrassed to say it. The kid is 3.

It could very well be that the parent in this case was the one who really wanted to go to the event, and the kid was a convenient (if ridiculous) scapegoat. A better approach might have looked like, \"I know you want to, but (blank) is dangerous to do right now. We can adjust our plans & find something that won't be dangerous instead. We don't make decisions like this as a punishment - we make them to protect ourselves from harm.\"\n\n\nIf you don't \"microdose'' children on decisionmaking & responsibility, then they turn 18 and suddenly have a deluge of power that was never afforded to them before, and they don't know how to use that power responsibly.
