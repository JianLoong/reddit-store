Not by a long shot. I live in Canada where the air quality was recently very poor. I'm a grown-ass 26yo man and I was having a hard time breathing outside in that. It gets physically painful to breathe after only about 10-15 minutes. I can't imagine how that would be for a child and I would absolutely never let a little kid out in that air quality.

The fact is that warnings were put out to keep kids inside, she did not do so. It\u2019s that simple.

Absolutely horrifying that your wife exposed the two young kids to that for no real reason at all.", "NTA \n\nShe apparently doesn't have much common sense and she's the AH.
