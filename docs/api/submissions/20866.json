Not by a long shot. I live in Canada where the air quality was recently very poor. I'm a grown-ass 26yo man and I was having a hard time breathing outside in that. It gets physically painful to breathe after only about 10-15 minutes. I can't imagine how that would be for a child and I would absolutely never let a little kid out in that air quality. Especially not one with pre-existing health conditions. There are a lot of ways to entertain your kids indoors. She should never have even considered an outdoor thing under those conditions. It was 100% a blatant disregard for your kids' health and well-being.", "NTA. Your kids and their safety needs to be paramount, whether other people deem the hazard as dangerous or not. The fact is that warnings were put out to keep kids inside, she did not do so. It\u2019s that simple. Not to mention she did it without even speaking to you, parenting is a two way street and the fact that she took them without telling you says she already knew it would cause an issue.", "NTA \n\nYour kids health is the top priority. That should have been that. I am also in the effected area and air quality was *awful*. I mean it\u2019s bad enough that outdoor concerts are being cancelled, and that\u2019s because of how dangerous it would be for *adults* to be exposed to this air quality. This isn\u2019t a little sub-optimal air quality warning. It was *bad*. Absolutely horrifying that your wife exposed the two young kids to that for no real reason at all.", "NTA \n\nShe apparently doesn't have much common sense and she's the AH. As an adult, she shouldn't let a toddler make health decisions for her and their sibling. Shame on her. Their little lungs don't need all that smoke exposure, especially since your son has had problems before. \n\nEDIT: I had to go back when I first read your post because you said \"he\" when referring to your wife!", "NTA, we're in an area affected by the wildfire smoke and it's pretty miserable to be outside in this, even masked. After 15 minutes out to pick up groceries our eyes were watering from the smoke. \n\nYour children's health is paramount and your wife's seeming disregard for this is alarming.", "I\u2019m in upstate NY and have breathing issues. I couldn\u2019t even get half my chores done today from the smoke. I can\u2019t even imagine how reckless that was of her. Was her mom egging this on? Even the deer around here are on edge. This is real.", "NTA. I live in Northern California right where all the fires were from 2018-2021. I had mild asthma until I moved up here, but after all the fires I now have two inhalers and more issues than before. Fire smoke is no joke and those warnings are there for a reason. She should have heeded them.", "NTA I am also in a red area and the air really does get to you so fast. Made me and my husband sick just running errands. There was no reason to subject your kids to that for recreational activities and it is even worse since you both discussed it prior. She knew it was bad, agreed to keep them inside, and then put their health in jeopardy while trying to deceive you. No excuse.", "nta im in ontario and even if im not in a area where the smoke is prominent it still smells like barbecue constantly so i totally understand you yelling and getting mad because she was endangering the kids", "NTA. I live in Illinois, and even here it is SUPER foggy with smoke and I\u2019ve been limiting my kids (7 year old twins) outside time. We were even supposed to go on vacation this week to a nearby beach town and we had to cancel. They were devastate. But guess what- I\u2019m the adult, and I make hard decisions like that to keep my children SAFE. I can\u2019t even imagine how bad it must be in Canada. That is very poor parenting and I\u2019d be furious.", "NTA, one of my former managers spent 2-3 years in Beijing with her new born and everyday she'd check the air quality before going out because she was doing her duty as a parent. The air quality got so bad sometimes that she'd spend days in the apartment but she managed to keep them entertained somehow.", "NTA. Are you in Illinois? I live in the city of Chicago and yesterday and today were absolute atrocities. I couldn't even drive to work with the AC on without my car filling up with smoke particles. I live in a brand new building and the common areas smell like burnt plastic. I saw a few people working out outside and mentally judged them for being careless with their health. \n\nI work in a clinic and every patient has remarked about the air quality. I have young patients as well and their parents were all remaining indoors. Definitey NTA. Incredibly irresponsible.", "We also live in a state that is Code Red right now and we didn\u2019t even let our DOGS spend much time outside, just enough to potty then back inside.

I can't even imagine how the children are handling it.", "ESH. In Alberta we get this awful smoke now every summer. Climate change sucks but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to keep your kids inside all summer long. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t normally get the smoke, I\u2019m just warning it\u2019s something you may have to get used to too. The boreal forest is big and not suited for where the summer temperatures are now.", "How did you know she was there?  Do you track her via her phone?  That\u2019s AH behaviour\u2026..", "YTA.

Friends try to make you happy, Moms take care of you even when it means saying no. She needs to Mom-up, especially if your son has health concerns. Ignoring health concerns is showing you don't actually love your son. Assuming she does love him, she needs to show it with her actions.", "NTA You were understandably upset that your wife put your children at risk! It is called being a parent and because both of you are parents to these children and both of you are human, there will be times when you disagree about parenting issues.  She should not have gone against the agreement to keep the children inside, especially given that your sons has suffered with health issues.", "NTA She doesn\u2019t think that it is important. Sadly this is pretty common.", "NTA \n\nTo give you some idea. In the USA they were telling people in cities near Canada to use N95 or KN95 masks and that breathing in the air for just a few hours was the equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes. Children and the elderly were told not to go out at all. Adults were told to limit exposure as much as possible with masks.\n\nWatch your son for signs of respiratory distress. Then just impress upon your wife that your children are still growing and this can really affect the development and health of their lungs.", "NTA - risking lifelong health issues due to smoke exposure because a child, who is not old enough to understand the ramifications, wanted to do something is not acceptable. That\u2019s when parents need to step up and parent and enforce the decisions that have been jointly made.", "Just cause it's normal in one spot doesn't mean its normal in others. If you don't take precautions your health will suffer when you're older. Imagine breathing campfire smoke 24/7 that's essentially what you're doing with these wildfires.\n\nNTA op especially with your son who has already had health issues", "We share both our locations with each other since my old job had me traveling constantly and you never know what would happen. The new iOS puts their location under their name at the top of the text thread now, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have even known.

My left lung is scarred and will never work the same again. It is not \"just smoke\". It could give those kids life-long issues.", "Ugh, I thought the same until I experienced it here. It\u2019s not like campfire smoke. It\u2019s gritty, it hurts, it\u2019s in your eyes and throat and on your skin and clothes. After only seconds outside It feels like someone has thrown chalk dust into your mouth and you need water which helps for a second until you inhale again and your eyes are burning. Absolutely noxious and I don\u2019t have asthma or any breathing problems. For me it\u2019s unbearable.  I didn\u2019t expect that at all - I\u2019m not someone who is bothered by cigarettes, diesel fuel etc. It feels like I\u2019m being poisoned when I step outside.", "Not gonna choke and die? Do you know what smoke does to you? They won't do that immediately in their state because they're simply too far away. What will happen though is their throats and eyes will become irritated and it will be hard/hurt to breath.\n\nShort term effects would be exactly what I said pain. Long term effects could anything from an infection of some sort to cancer.", "Proper course of action:\n\n I told this to my wife at around 10am because shehe had been planning on taking them to an outdoor event while at her mother\u2019s. *We discussed and agreed not to take kids there.*  Instead of  *I said not to and that it could wait for another day*", "I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with that. Thank you for sharing, it\u2019s important to know that there can be detrimental effects for those who may be tempted to just tough it out without precautions.", "i mean, where i live in ontario we have all of the air quality warnings right now and its actually fine. the official warnings are there but we aren\u2019t getting hit by the effects at all.", "Regardless of what was said, it sounds like she still went against OP\u2019s wishes by going without even saying anything to them, for all we know there was an agreement not to go. Either way when it comes to children on certain things there isn\u2019t too much caution, and if one already had health issues then situations that could cause more should immediately be avoided. A toddler should not be making that decision, it\u2019s for the parent to think logically and put their wellbeing first.", "I also live in Ontario and it affected me differently. I guess that\u2019s just how the case would be, but either way you really shouldn\u2019t take that chance when it comes to kids. Events come and go, their health needs to be first and foremost.", "And toddler's mother made a decision. It is clearly not the one OP (or you) agree with but at that moment the wife was a primary caretaker. Therefore her decision", "just sharing a different perspective, since OP said there was an air quality warning but hasn't mentioned what its actually like. i know many places are heavily, heavily affected but there are also places that aren't so much. we're technically under an air quality warning but everyone is outside because it really is not affecting us here right now. like another commenter from AB said, can't just keep kids inside all summer every summer.", "No. absolutely not. both of them are parents. you don\u2019t get to make a decision with your co parent and then go against it just because the other parent happens to not be present at the moment.\n\nif a decision needs to be made, and the other parent is unavailable, then it\u2019s up to whoever is available. but in this situation the decision had already been made by both of them, and it needs to be abided by. they agreed not to take the kids. so she can\u2019t take the kids without talking to him", "I sincerely hope you\u2019re not implying that just because she was primary caretaker at the time that automatically means she made the right decision. That\u2019s simply not how parenting works.", "True but if this is in the states then it could just be a single day before the quality clears up. Either way if the warning says not to and you have a kid with health issues already, best not to push it.", " *they agreed not to take the kids*\n\nNo they did not. OP told her wife not to take the kids. There was no agreement", "I am not saying she made a right or wrong decision.  I am saying OP is an A for screaming at his wife for making a decision he disagreed with", "read the edit. if he\u2019s lying obviously he\u2019s the asshole, but if he\u2019s telling the truth then there was an agreement", "And you\u2019re an A for focusing on that instead of the real issue here.

But bushfires/wildfires don't just burn trees. Houses, cars, factories - all kinds of things get consumed in the fire. And those toxic chemicals and particulates don't just disappear.\n\nAnd the thing is if you live in an area that's impacted by the smoke, if you can smell the smoke you're inhaling the smoke. Even indoors with doors/windows closed and air filters and other preventative measures, some amount of smoke gets through. It clings to clothes and hair and skin.
