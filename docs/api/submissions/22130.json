The best man (my fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend) just told us he met a girl through Bumble and had an amazing first date. He says they are just like each other\u2014 have similar hobbies, loves the same movies and games. He\u2019s been single for a long time. She even stayed the night and did the deed. For him it\u2019s been 3+ years since he did it.\n\nWell, he told me and my fianc\u00e9 that he invited her to the wedding after only 2 days of hanging out IN REAL LIFE. I told him there\u2019s no way she can come to the wedding because we already decided on the seating arrangement since we told everyone to RSVP via invitations on June 28. And honestly as the bride, I\u2019m not trying to meet new people on my wedding day especially a girl that he has known in real life for 2 days.

Judging him for wanting to bring a bumble date most likely didn\u2019t sit well with him.", "NTA - you haven\u2019t even met the woman! Yes she might be lovely and great for the best man, but the timing is just unfortunate and he shouldn\u2019t expect you to be okay with him inviting her. That\u2019s yours and your partner\u2019s choice. Weddings are super expensive as is, let alone when you counter in inviting strangers. She is a stranger. And that\u2019s that. You can compromise and meet her another time. I\u2019d be curious to hear how the woman feels about being invited.", "NTA but it kind of depends.  If the RSVP date has long passed then he cannot change to a plus 1.  Period.  Tell him you simply cannot add someone to guest list at this late date.  (That seems to be the case here.)\n\nOn the other hand, if the invitation includes a guest and someone does RSVP with a plus one - I don't think you really get a say on who that plus one is.", "INFO: This is your fianc\u00e9's best man. How does your fianc\u00e9 feel about the situation?", "NTA, RSVP rules kinda state it all because, as you said, seating arrangements and catering costs are a part of the issue.\nIf this were just some get-together event or even a holiday, it'd be different.", "NTA\n\nIt is your wedding, you get to decide who is invited, he doesn't.", "NTA.  It's not even about him being the best man or them meeting on Bumble recently.  It's about it being to late for him to bring a +1.  As you said, RSVPs are in and seating charts are made.", "NTA.  My friends had a casual backyard wedding.  A friend of the groom actually brought his TINDER HOOKUP.  She came, complained about heat/food/drink and especially her prior-night CFM heels that weren't good for a backyard.  She was so obnoxious.  The groom forced his guest to send her away in an Uber.", "NTA - First of all, why would she even want to attend you wedding? I could see if he was a regular guest and could spend the whole time hanging out with her, but he is the best man. That means for a considerable amount of the time during the wedding day he is going to doing things (getting ready, taking pictures, standing up with you during the ceremony, etc.) that she cannot participate in. They won't even be able to arrive together. \n\nSecond, while \"no ring, no bring\" is way too strict and not really keeping with the times, I do think there need to be some parameters for +1s, especially for the wedding party. Generally the people in your wedding party are going to be the people you are in closest proximity to during the reception (e.g. sitting together during dinner). So those are going to be the people who are in most of your candid pictures (for people who care about that) and who you are spending time with. It is reasonable to want those to be a) people that you at least know and feel comfortable with; and b) people who you can reasonably expect to still be in the picture (figuratively) 5, 10 years down the line. (Obviously not everyone stays friends with the people in their wedding party forever, people grow apart. But having the woman your friend dated for 3 months in the majority of your candid photos is going to be annoying)\n\nThird, while I fully believe that you need to respect other peoples' relationships if you expect them to put time and effort into celebrating yours, I think it is completely reasonable to draw the line at relationships that started after your wedding invites went out.\n\nYou could talk to your fiance and see if he wants to offer his friend a compromise - he can bring this woman as a +1 if he wants to step down from the wedding party. That may or may not be possible given you already have the seating arranged, but it would be easier to change up a random table than the head table. I am sure it would suck for your fiance to not have his friend stand up with him, but it solves the issue of having someone you don't know at your top table and it also means that the GF isn't spending the majority of the day by herself.", "NTA - probably could have handled it better but the cut off for adding a +1 has passed.", "NTA the rsvp deadline passed.  You might want to bend a little though for the sake of the friendship.  Maybe he could pay for her dinner or something.  Try to meet her or have a trusted friend meet her to validate she\u2019s not totally abnormal.  You don\u2019t have to do that but it might smooth things over.", "NTA - you haven\u2019t even met the woman! Yes she might be lovely and great for the best man, but the timing is just unfortunate and he shouldn\u2019t expect you to be okay with him inviting her. That\u2019s yours and your partner\u2019s choice.", "In my opinion yes\nYou are the asshole", "If you literally cannot accommodate her due to venue restrictions, then N T A. There's nothing you can do.\n\nTHAT SAID, if there's nothing stopping you from putting one more chair in and spending another $110 so your fiance can make his best friend/best man happy, that is personally what I would do. If you're super worried about meeting someone new at the wedding (I met a few of my cousins' SOs at my own wedding, it was totally fine!), you could ask the friend to set up a casual double date situation or something sometime before the wedding. I just think a best man/wedding party member is deserving of special consideration if it's possible.", "YTA you are punishing him because you don't think he did enough as a best man. More importantly are you ready to lose your best man because he chose his \"love of his life\" over your wedding.", "ESH. If seating arrangements have been finalized, you\u2019re within your rights to say it is too late to add someone. Also I have seen so many things where everything might be great for like 2, 3, 5 or a handful of dates and then violently explode.  No way to tell how this will actually go. \n\nWith all that said, even though he\u2019s an asshole, if it were me and it were reasonably in my ability to bend on this I would. You want your best man to be happy and if it is just giving her a seat, you should do it. Plus, you\u2019re kind of making a mess with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s relationship with someone very close to him. \n\nAlso the whole \u201cI\u2019m not trying to meet a new person on my wedding day\u201d thing is nonsense. Are you really telling me that matters?  You met all your extended in-laws to be and their +1s?  I have been married before. I met a ton of new people that day. It was fine. It\u2019s just not that dramatic. Your attitude on it just comes off as Royal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s the best man. She can rightly say no but sometimes being right doesn\u2019t mean inflexible. He should be able to bring a date and have a bit of leeway as far as the RSVP.  Wouldn\u2019t most single people be invited with a plus one?", "In that case it seems like a pretty straightforward NTA.
