My mom's oldest brother is Liam and he has been widowered for almost 25 years now. She was sick briefly and passed quickly and left him and their son, my cousin Ben behind. Ben is 32 and lost his mom when he was only 7. At some point a year or two after Liam's wife passed away, Ben had mentioned maybe dating again to his siblings and then a few weeks later had told them he changed his mind and when asked, he said Ben didn't want him to date and replace his mom and he didn't want to upset his son or force a new person on him if he wanted things to stay the same. He said it would be more trouble than it was worth (exact quote as told to me by mom a couple of years ago). My aunt and other uncle were furious that Ben would say that to Liam and that Liam would swear off dating for a child. But Liam insisted he was fine. Liam has never been on a single date or had any kind of romantic relationship with anyone since his wife died. There are times he seems lonely but he and Ben are very close and he spends time with his grandkids a lot also.\n\nApparently my aunt and other uncle never ever got over the fact Ben never gave his dad permission to date and the fact he knows Liam hasn't dated and still doesn't encourage it.\n\nThis all bubbled over at my wedding. I had no idea the anger was still so strong. But while Ben and his wife were dancing, and Liam was dancing with his grandkids, my aunt and other uncle went over to confront Ben and started yelling and calling him selfish. In the space of about twenty minutes everyone in attendance knew an 8/9 year old Ben had asked his dad not to date and that Liam listened and had never dated since his wife died. Security had to step in. Ben, his wife, their kids and Liam all left and my aunt and uncle were kicked out.\n\nI was angry. The whole thing caused such a disruption and shifted the whole focus away from the party. I called my aunt a few days later and told her she needed to apologize and she said she couldn't believe I would ask for one and wasn't on their side. Then three days ago I saw her and my uncle and told them they had no right to start an argument at my wedding and should be ashamed of themselves.

They had no right to get involved in that in the first place let alone at your wedding.", "NTA. Aunt could have waited until after the party to confront Ben, doing so on the dance floor was disrespectful.

While I would agree that it is odd to let a small child dictate whether dad can ever date again, that is neither my business nor theirs to judge or confront the man.\n\nBesides, how does anyone even know that was true? Maybe he still holds a candle for his wife and used his son as an excuse not to date. Either way, who cares? It is his life and no skin off anyone else's nose whether he dates.", "NTA - even if your aunt and uncles complaints were reasonable (I don't think they were - Liam made a choice, and presumably if he wanted to start dating again when Ben was a bit older and more independent he could have done so), you don't deliberately start an argument (that is completely unconnected to anything that's happening at that moment) at a wedding!", "NTA\n\nIt is irrelevant who takes which side on this - there is a time and a place for this kind of disagreement and someone's wedding is not that place.", "NTA  Your aunt and uncle should have minded their own business and not spoiled your day.", "Bit weird that Ben is still not encouraging it.

Bear with me:\n\nOP is obviously not an arsehole for being upset that her reception devolved into a fight.\n\nUncle Liam is a very sweet dad for listening to Ben and not getting back into dating.\n\nObviously, we can't get mad at young Ben for not wanting his dead mother replaced. But depending on how strongly and recently he's expressed that opinion, older Ben might be the biggest arsehole here.\n\nI can't blame the siblings of Uncle Liam for getting mad that he's been forced into a lonely life because of Ben's choices as a young child though - if he has continued to express that choice as an adult. Especially with all the couples dancing together at the reception.", "Wtf? How could the be so selfish? Not only did they hold something like that for 25! years.

How could they think it was okay to bring that up and start an argument at your wedding? The event wasn't even about your uncle or cousin, and even then it'd be in bad taste. They sound horrible. No way do you need to \"stand by them\" after that.\n\nNot that it's really the topic, but as far as the issue goes... I think it's quite normal for an 8 or 9 year old kid to not want their parent to date shortly after the death of the other. Ben isn't at fault for that. But Liam didn't need to swear off dating forever because of it, and Ben can't be held accountable for Liam's decision there. Especially not now that they're both adults. Ben would've been able to deal with it eventually. I feel for Liam in this case, but he had a really extreme reaction to a kid younger than 10 being wary about a parent dating again (as most kids are, and then grow to accept if their parent does it right and doesn't force their new partner down the kids' throat).", "It was both her and my (other) uncle who did it.

The odds of him not dating in 20+ years because of his 8yo are minimal.\n\nLiam is an adult and the parent.  It was his choice.  Child Ben is not accountable for that choice, nor is now Adult Ben.\n\nAunt would have been an AH for confronting Ben or even raising it with him no matter where she did it.

Sorry it happened at your wedding.", "Yeah, I, I was really struggling with whether I was wrong for how I felt about that. Like I know generally you don't do that stuff at someone else's party.

They have emotions and opinions about this topic but grounded and unselfish adults practice delay acting-on emotions.

If you do, only you suffer. \n\nAgain, sorry this selfish & hurtful act occurred. Even if people diminish it due to 'years of frustration, use of alcohol/substances, etc'; people are still responsible for their actions.  Ironically, the topic is none of their business; a son and father discussed a topic. The father should be respected for his decision. No one have the right to judge his life.

It was very disrespectful your aunt and uncle to bring this up at your wedding, causing such a disruption that they had to be removed.

It\u2019s a very private issue between a man and his son and it doesn\u2019t need to involve the entire family. I totally understand that Liam didn\u2019t want to disturb young 7yo Ben who had just lost his mom by starting to date again, and it\u2019s weird that your aunt and uncle were apparently upset by that at the time. Putting off dating again for a bit longer to let your 7yo heal from his loss seems to me like a reasonable decision, you shouldn\u2019t resent the child in that situation. However I do find it surprising that this was never reevaluated as Ben got older, became independent and started his own family. But at the end of the day, that is Liam\u2019s life, he\u2019s a grown man, he can make his own decisions. Unless he personally was frustrated by the situation, had tried to talk to his son to no avail and had asked his brother and sister to step in as a last resort to try to make his son understand his point of view\u2026 that is none of their business.\n\nIn any case, your wedding was certainly NOT a good time to bring that (or any other family drama) up.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that happened to you and I hope you were still able to enjoy your day.

Why not a kind email to let Ben know that his father has spent 25 years living up to a promise that he made to his 7y/o self?

Attacking him 25 years later is irrational. Holding a grudge against him over something that happened when he was under the age of 10 is a sign of a deep need for therapy\u2014for the aunt and uncle.  It\u2019s not normal and it\u2019s not okay.\n\n2.  Liam is a fully functioning adult, capable of making his own decisions.  I\u2019d lay down money the reason he hasn\u2019t dated is because HE doesn\u2019t want to, and it stopped being about what Ben wanted decades ago.  He probably used Ben\u2019s opinion (as a child!) as an excuse to do what his gut instincts told him he really wanted\u2014not what other people thought he should do, but what HE wanted to do.\n\n3.  It\u2019s not Ben\u2019s place to nag his father about dating, and in any event, this aunt and uncle cannot possibly know what conversations have taken place behind the scenes.  Ben may very well be encouraging his dad to date.  None of the rest of you are around 24/7 to know.  It\u2019s also possible that Ben recognizes that it\u2019s useless to nag.  It is also possible that Ben prefers things the way they are, but then let\u2019s go back to point #2.  Liam gets to decide how he lives his life.

Ben was attacked in front of a large group of people over something completely out of his control, and his relationship with the aunt and uncle are probably ruined forever.  I\u2019m sure he felt embarrassed and humiliated over being dressed down in public.

I think not!

Liam is, for making his young son, Ben, his excuse not to date instead of acknowledging he just didn't want to date.  Aunt a n d uncle TAs for starting the fight, and not letting Liam do his life his way.", "NTA It sounds like Liam was focused on taking care of Ben after his wife died, and that the other family member's felt like Ben was holding Liam back. And while a kid can protest a parent dating, they don't 'give permission' to do it. It seems like Liam is fine without dating and enjoys his close relationship with his son. I'm not sure why they're so fired up about that, but they ruined your wedding and are refusing to take any responsibility for it.", "Wow ok so first NTA. There\u2019s no reason your wedding should have the time or place for this type of confrontation. \n\nSecond, it was Liam\u2019s decision to not date because he thought it would be best for his child. If had met someone he really liked then I am sure that would have changed. Yes he probably is very lonely. People who lose their spouse tend to feel this way. It\u2019s sad, but it sounds like he is ok with the arrangement. If he wasn\u2019t then he is the only one who can change it. \n\nThird, if him dating is still a huge issue to Ben who is now more than mature enough to handle this should it arise that\u2019s something Liam needs to deal with with Ben. It\u2019s really no one else\u2019s business.", "I'm so sorry that your family decided to choose your wedding day to stir up some drama. Your wedding day wasn't as happy as it could've been. They could've chosen any day to do what they did, yet they specifically chose your wedding day. They probably planned this. \n\nNTA", "NTA...and I'm going to slowly exit now.", "That last part is a really good point, two years after the wife/mom\u2019s death seems like it would prime time for people like that aunt and uncle to be saying \u201cyou need to start dating again, it\u2019s been long enough\u201d and maybe Liam just wasn\u2019t ready and thought it would be less familial pressure if it was for his kid, maybe he went on a date in those few I between weeks and realized he wasn\u2019t ready", "My parents divorced when I was 6. My mom never even went on a date, even after we encouraged her when we were in highschool. I'm 35 now and she still just isn't interested in dating and says she's fulfilled in her life without a romantic partner. Let adults make their own decisions!", "I fully agree", "Exactly right. This is what I was thinking too. OP is NTA and the aunt and uncle are rude for causing a scene at OP's wedding over something that's really none of their business.", "My guess is after his son (understandably) shot it down he just accepted that his dating days are over. OP says sometimes he seems lonely which is also understandable.", "What? Reddit is wild. Y'all just just make up stuff in your head and run with it huh lol. There are zero indications to that here.", "Who do we know about the conversation from? \n\nNot from Ben.\n\nFrom the siblings that Liam talked to. \n\nI know my family harassed both my sister and I about the fact that each of us just kinda...stopped dating. There was a lot of pressure. Liam used a nice, self-sacrificing excuse, which may - or may not be - true.", "Not the asshole.", "NTA \n\nThe wedding was not the right place for them to hash that out.\n\nBen needs therapy. I can see when he was real little, but by time he was 18, it should have ended. That would have been 11 years which is plenty of time.\n\nLiam needs to go on a date or 500. \n\nYour other family needs to apologize.\n\nDon't invite anyone but Liam to future family gatherings till the rest of them hash it out. Maybe invite a lonely window! ;)", "Why do they give a shit what Liam decides to do with his life?", "Absolutely NTA.", "What the hell kind of business is it of your aunt and uncle\u2019s for having anything to say about the situation? That\u2019s between Liam and Ben, and if both of them are happy with the situation, no one else gets a say. You are NTA, and I would probably end contact for good with the aunt and uncle over that, if it had been me. Wow.", "NTA and I am stunned you were even questioning this. The thing between Liam and his son had nothing to do with your ceremony and that was not at ALL the time or place to hash it out. Although I admit I agree letting Ben to this day guilt his father into not at least dating is pretty shitty. Ultimately, it's also NOBODYS business but Liam and Bens.", "So much wtf. An 8-year-old kid who had recently lost his mother apparently said he'd rather his dad didn't replace her. And they decide this is still relevant enough, a quarter of a century later, to bring it up at someone else's wedding?", "A wedding isn't the place to air dirty laundry, and most adults know that.", ">To be fair, Ben never had any say really.\n\nTo be very, very fair it looks like the original ask was about a year after his mother died, which isn't enough time for a child to recover (as much as they ever will) from that kind of loss.  So asking for a little bit more time was reasonable.  \n\nHowever at this point we are way past reasonable.", "Making a scene at a wedding isn't an AH move to you? Hope you stay away from weddings", "I've seen a lot of \"Ben like\" kids/adults in the same situation. I stand by my comment.", "Fantastic pettiness.", "NTA \nA lot of widows don\u2019t remarry. \nMy parents had a normal divorce and never remarried or really had partners of significance because they won\u2019t remarry", "The only reason I say soft yta is because you're ASKING!! Honestly, I would send them a bill for the hours they disrupted your wedding.  Then just to be petty cause I am, I would give them a taste of their own medicine and tell them if you don't get a meaningful apology you are taking them to small claims court for damages and you have witness accounts and video proof.  Entitled Ass____ only knows this language.\n\nOf course your NTA", "On what planet did they think it's at all acceptable to start an argument like this at a *wedding*? NTA and the absolute gall of those two.", "Nta. Sounds ljke your aunt & uncle have some mental issues. And while i agree he should have moved on (marriage is until death do u part), its sad to see someone think staying single is some type of honor/devotion type thing, it isnt.  But it's a way to hang on for some ppl. He had the chance, at any time in his life  to move on & date. He asked his son & honored his sons wishes. He didnt have to but HE chose to. They are mad at the wrong person. Not that it matters, its not their business.", "With over a decade of not dating after Ben grew up, it\u2019s more likely that Liam has decided he prefers being single. Many older people who have been single for a while find they enjoy the freedom and even when dating continue to live alone.", "From everything you\u2019ve said it sounds like they don\u2019t want Ben to \u201cencourage\u201d Liam to date so much as pressure him to date. Which is probably what they were doing when he demurred all those years ago.", "I think it's weird how people get so worked up when someone else decides not to date. I never dated in high school or college because I wasn't interested in anyone. No other reason. People used to get so upset about it, like trying to figure out what was \"wrong\" with me or pleading with me to \"get out more,\" telling me it would be too late someday. I still don't know why my singlehood scared people so much.\n\nIncidentally, I've been happily married for 18 years. My husband is the only person I ever seriously dated. If it wasn't for him, I'd probably still be happily single and people would probably still be trying to tell me that I'm not happy.", "NTA", "NTA.   People should keep their shit out of other people's celebrations. \n\nThey are not worth your energy.  Ignore them and anything they have to say on the matter and move on.\n\nIf they try to bring it up, just tell them that you will only listen to their apology for their inappropriate behaviour and nothing else.", "The fact that they didn't confront Ben or their brother after he moved out of the house, or when he got married and do it at Ben's wedding, or when Ben had kids. How about asking Liam if he ever wanted to start dating again? Maybe he didn't want to and that is why he was so willing to go along with his sons wish? Your Aunt and Uncle are definitely the AH, and you are NTA. There were so many opportunities in the past decade or more to have this conversation with their brother. Maybe they should have done it while they were all alone visiting Liam at his home (where he lives alone)?", "NTA\n\nLiam's an adult and made their own decision. Why are his brother and sister so butthurt? He seems healthy and happy.\n\nWhat a shameful scene"]}
