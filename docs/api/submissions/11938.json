My mom's oldest brother is Liam and he has been widowered for almost 25 years now. She was sick briefly and passed quickly and left him and their son, my cousin Ben behind. Ben is 32 and lost his mom when he was only 7. At some point a year or two after Liam's wife passed away, Ben had mentioned maybe dating again to his siblings and then a few weeks later had told them he changed his mind and when asked, he said Ben didn't want him to date and replace his mom and he didn't want to upset his son or force a new person on him if he wanted things to stay the same. He said it would be more trouble than it was worth (exact quote as told to me by mom a couple of years ago). My aunt and other uncle were furious that Ben would say that to Liam and that Liam would swear off dating for a child. But Liam insisted he was fine. Liam has never been on a single date or had any kind of romantic relationship with anyone since his wife died. There are times he seems lonely but he and Ben are very close and he spends time with his grandkids a lot also.\n\nApparently my aunt and other uncle never ever got over the fact Ben never gave his dad permission to date and the fact he knows Liam hasn't dated and still doesn't encourage it.\n\nThis all bubbled over at my wedding. I had no idea the anger was still so strong. But while Ben and his wife were dancing, and Liam was dancing with his grandkids, my aunt and other uncle went over to confront Ben and started yelling and calling him selfish. In the space of about twenty minutes everyone in attendance knew an 8/9 year old Ben had asked his dad not to date and that Liam listened and had never dated since his wife died. Security had to step in. Ben, his wife, their kids and Liam all left and my aunt and uncle were kicked out.\n\nI was angry. The whole thing caused such a disruption and shifted the whole focus away from the party. I called my aunt a few days later and told her she needed to apologize and she said she couldn't believe I would ask for one and wasn't on their side. Then three days ago I saw her and my uncle and told them they had no right to start an argument at my wedding and should be ashamed of themselves. They said I should care enough about Liam to stand by them and be willing to let my wedding take the place of when it would happen.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678443373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nl8lf/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_and_uncle_they_had_no/", "score": 375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was very disrespectful to you. Those people probably were planning on doing this and wanted to cause a stink.  They should really apologize", "NTA. That honour goes to anyone who would stir up decades-old happenings that aren't even any of their business, ie, your aunt. The fact that she did it at your wedding makes it even worse. Good luck getting an apology out of her...i wouldn't be surprised if she's the type of person who is always right, so never needs to apologize. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA: and your aunt and uncle being so tone deaf that they don\u2019t realise they should apologise?! Your aunt doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s not her place to comment on her brothers dating life?! And to blame a then 9 year old?? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t bother with them anymore.", "NTA. Regardless of the background, they must have had plenty of opportunities over the years to harass Ben but they chose your wedding to do it. It is beyond my imagination to come up with any reasons why they would be so invested in the idea of Liam dating, or why they would be angry because he was trying to do the best by his son.", "Definitely NTA. They had no right to get involved in that in the first place let alone at your wedding.", "NTA. Aunt could have waited until after the party to confront Ben, doing so on the dance floor was disrespectful. Not only to the bride and groom, but to Liam too, who now has had details of his private life spilled for an entire wedding party to hear. I'm guessing there were several people there who he didn't know as well.", "Nta, poor uncle Liam! It also seems like they've had years to figure this shit out and, for some reason, chose a time thats supposed to be a joyful moment.", "NTA- question for you OP was this the first time they were seeing Ben in over the 25 years since it happened? Sorry it happened at your wedding that\u2019s not cool of them. I\u2019m just curious as to why they haven\u2019t said anything in the whole time since it happened and was this the first opportunity for them to attack Ben for it. Not that their behaviour was anyways excusable.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. No matter what the issue they had no right to bring it up at a wedding.", "NTA\n\nYour Aunt and Uncle were bang out of order brining this up. Ultimately Liam\u2019s dating life isn\u2019t their issue and they\u2019ve got no right bringing it up with him ever, let alone at YOUR WEDDING.", "You're NTA. They were rude and disruptive at your wedding, and that is never appropriate. While I would agree that it is odd to let a small child dictate whether dad can ever date again, that is neither my business nor theirs to judge or confront the man.\n\nBesides, how does anyone even know that was true? Maybe he still holds a candle for his wife and used his son as an excuse not to date. Either way, who cares? It is his life and no skin off anyone else's nose whether he dates.", "NTA - even if your aunt and uncles complaints were reasonable (I don't think they were - Liam made a choice, and presumably if he wanted to start dating again when Ben was a bit older and more independent he could have done so), you don't deliberately start an argument (that is completely unconnected to anything that's happening at that moment) at a wedding!", "NTA\n\nIt is irrelevant who takes which side on this - there is a time and a place for this kind of disagreement and someone's wedding is not that place.", "NTA  Your aunt and uncle should have minded their own business and not spoiled your day.", "Bit weird that Ben is still not encouraging it. What's that all about?", "It is your day, you and husband make all decisions.  You're nta don't worry", "I think NAH. Bear with me:\n\nOP is obviously not an arsehole for being upset that her reception devolved into a fight.\n\nUncle Liam is a very sweet dad for listening to Ben and not getting back into dating.\n\nObviously, we can't get mad at young Ben for not wanting his dead mother replaced. But depending on how strongly and recently he's expressed that opinion, older Ben might be the biggest arsehole here.\n\nI can't blame the siblings of Uncle Liam for getting mad that he's been forced into a lonely life because of Ben's choices as a young child though - if he has continued to express that choice as an adult. Especially with all the couples dancing together at the reception.", "Wtf? How could the be so selfish? Not only did they hold something like that for 25! years. The go against the choices of their brother. And they also think after 25 years! it is okay to let it out on your wedding? And still don't think anything is wrong with that?\n\nAre the drama seeking? \n\nDefinitly NTA.

They picked Your Wedding to verbally attack someone over a long past act. YOUR WEDDING!\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the world? How could they think it was okay to bring that up and start an argument at your wedding? The event wasn't even about your uncle or cousin, and even then it'd be in bad taste. They sound horrible. No way do you need to \"stand by them\" after that.\n\nNot that it's really the topic, but as far as the issue goes... I think it's quite normal for an 8 or 9 year old kid to not want their parent to date shortly after the death of the other. Ben isn't at fault for that. But Liam didn't need to swear off dating forever because of it, and Ben can't be held accountable for Liam's decision there. Especially not now that they're both adults. Ben would've been able to deal with it eventually. I feel for Liam in this case, but he had a really extreme reaction to a kid younger than 10 being wary about a parent dating again (as most kids are, and then grow to accept if their parent does it right and doesn't force their new partner down the kids' throat).", "It was both her and my (other) uncle who did it. So two of them stirred it up. Deep down I know they won't apologize.", "They see Ben as selfish and believe as an adult he should have wanted his dad to be less lonely and less sad and that by encouraging him to date since he was clearly interested back then would show he has grown from who he was as a kid.", "Aunt should never have confronted Ben.  Ben did nothing wrong.  Liam asked his child how he felt about him dating, child told truth.  Liam decided not to date, possibly because of Ben, possibly for his own reasons.  The odds of him not dating in 20+ years because of his 8yo are minimal.\n\nLiam is an adult and the parent.  It was his choice.  Child Ben is not accountable for that choice, nor is now Adult Ben.\n\nAunt would have been an AH for confronting Ben or even raising it with him no matter where she did it.  She's an extra AH for doing it at the wedding.", "It's the first time they have seen him in many years. I think once Ben hit 17 or something there wasn't really any time they were in the same place together.", "I have no idea. It's not something I would ever think of bringing up with him.", "They lack social grace and sound judgement to use your wedding to confront a topic that does not involve them.", "This all doesn't make any sense. If liam really wanted to date he could have started dating when ben was 18 or moved out. Nobody needs the permission of their adult kids to date and i'm sure ben would have been fine with it / gotten over it. \n\nFor me this sounds like in the years after his wifes death and his minor son not wanting a new mom he realised he doesn't need a SO and is perfectly fine with being single, even when he had over a decade now since his son is an adult.", "Your for sure not the asshole the polite thing for them to do was to ask if they could meet up say later to discuss it if they felt they had to do it. Not that they have a right to say anything but if they really really really felt the need then there was better ways of doing it. Doing it at your wedding was not acceptable. Sorry it happened at your wedding.", "Yeah, I, I was really struggling with whether I was wrong for how I felt about that. Like I know generally you don't do that stuff at someone else's party. But part of me wondered if I was selfish for not wanting it to happen at my wedding.", "You're not selfish. They have emotions and opinions about this topic but grounded and unselfish adults practice delay acting-on emotions. A loved ones wedding is not the time nor the place. \n\nSince '...they won't apologize' then don't pine or wait for one. If you do, only you suffer. \n\nAgain, sorry this selfish & hurtful act occurred. Even if people diminish it due to 'years of frustration, use of alcohol/substances, etc'; people are still responsible for their actions.  Ironically, the topic is none of their business; a son and father discussed a topic. The father should be respected for his decision. No one have the right to judge his life.  They need to stay focused on the life they are building like torching bridges with family.", "NTA. I'm guessing ben has little contact with his toxic aunt and uncle and they saw their chance to pounce and yeah, way way way beyond not appropriate. your aunt talking about people being on her side shows she has no clue. \"It doesn't matter if i'm on your side or not, what matters is your shouldn't have done it there at all.\"", ">They said I should care enough about Liam to stand by them and be willing to let my wedding take the place of when it would happen.\n\nIt's not even any of their business in the first place much less do they get to pick a fight on your wedding and then complain you should be on their side about it. I'd cut them out. NTA.\n\nLiam is an adult and he can chose not to date. Ben grew up, got married, and has kids. I doubt Liam is still not dating because his seven or eight year old told him not to and if he is, it's still his choice. This is bewildering.

You don't need that crazy in your newly married lives.", "They felt entitled to do it at her wedding. Not any other gathering her wedding.

They shouldn't have bought it up at all, and the fact that they did so at your wedding shoes what meddling busybodies who don't really care about other's feelings they are.", "Your wedding is one of the moments where you're allowed to be selfish (to certain degree, of course).\n\nYou invite who want, serve what you want, decorate and dictate dress, etc. and you can expect everyone to be respectful and hopefully even jovial. And if anyone doesn't want to follow your rules, they don't have to be there. And if they're causing a scene by airing family drama, you're allowed to boot them out.\n\nI hope that Ben's kids are OK and weren't scared with the yelling about their dad and grandpa."]}
