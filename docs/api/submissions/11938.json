My mom's oldest brother is Liam and he has been widowered for almost 25 years now. She was sick briefly and passed quickly and left him and their son, my cousin Ben behind. Ben is 32 and lost his mom when he was only 7. At some point a year or two after Liam's wife passed away, Ben had mentioned maybe dating again to his siblings and then a few weeks later had told them he changed his mind and when asked, he said Ben didn't want him to date and replace his mom and he didn't want to upset his son or force a new person on him if he wanted things to stay the same. He said it would be more trouble than it was worth (exact quote as told to me by mom a couple of years ago). My aunt and other uncle were furious that Ben would say that to Liam and that Liam would swear off dating for a child. But Liam insisted he was fine. Liam has never been on a single date or had any kind of romantic relationship with anyone since his wife died. There are times he seems lonely but he and Ben are very close and he spends time with his grandkids a lot also.\n\nApparently my aunt and other uncle never ever got over the fact Ben never gave his dad permission to date and the fact he knows Liam hasn't dated and still doesn't encourage it.\n\nThis all bubbled over at my wedding.

But while Ben and his wife were dancing, and Liam was dancing with his grandkids, my aunt and other uncle went over to confront Ben and started yelling and calling him selfish. In the space of about twenty minutes everyone in attendance knew an 8/9 year old Ben had asked his dad not to date and that Liam listened and had never dated since his wife died. Security had to step in. Ben, his wife, their kids and Liam all left and my aunt and uncle were kicked out.\n\nI was angry. The whole thing caused such a disruption and shifted the whole focus away from the party. I called my aunt a few days later and told her she needed to apologize and she said she couldn't believe I would ask for one and wasn't on their side. Then three days ago I saw her and my uncle and told them they had no right to start an argument at my wedding and should be ashamed of themselves.

They had no right to get involved in that in the first place let alone at your wedding.", "NTA. Aunt could have waited until after the party to confront Ben, doing so on the dance floor was disrespectful.

While I would agree that it is odd to let a small child dictate whether dad can ever date again, that is neither my business nor theirs to judge or confront the man.\n\nBesides, how does anyone even know that was true? Maybe he still holds a candle for his wife and used his son as an excuse not to date. Either way, who cares? It is his life and no skin off anyone else's nose whether he dates.", "NTA - even if your aunt and uncles complaints were reasonable (I don't think they were - Liam made a choice, and presumably if he wanted to start dating again when Ben was a bit older and more independent he could have done so), you don't deliberately start an argument (that is completely unconnected to anything that's happening at that moment) at a wedding!", "NTA\n\nIt is irrelevant who takes which side on this - there is a time and a place for this kind of disagreement and someone's wedding is not that place.", "NTA  Your aunt and uncle should have minded their own business and not spoiled your day.", "Bit weird that Ben is still not encouraging it.

Bear with me:\n\nOP is obviously not an arsehole for being upset that her reception devolved into a fight.\n\nUncle Liam is a very sweet dad for listening to Ben and not getting back into dating.\n\nObviously, we can't get mad at young Ben for not wanting his dead mother replaced. But depending on how strongly and recently he's expressed that opinion, older Ben might be the biggest arsehole here.\n\nI can't blame the siblings of Uncle Liam for getting mad that he's been forced into a lonely life because of Ben's choices as a young child though - if he has continued to express that choice as an adult. Especially with all the couples dancing together at the reception.", "Wtf? How could the be so selfish? Not only did they hold something like that for 25! years.

How could they think it was okay to bring that up and start an argument at your wedding? The event wasn't even about your uncle or cousin, and even then it'd be in bad taste. They sound horrible. No way do you need to \"stand by them\" after that.\n\nNot that it's really the topic, but as far as the issue goes... I think it's quite normal for an 8 or 9 year old kid to not want their parent to date shortly after the death of the other. Ben isn't at fault for that. But Liam didn't need to swear off dating forever because of it, and Ben can't be held accountable for Liam's decision there. Especially not now that they're both adults. Ben would've been able to deal with it eventually. I feel for Liam in this case, but he had a really extreme reaction to a kid younger than 10 being wary about a parent dating again (as most kids are, and then grow to accept if their parent does it right and doesn't force their new partner down the kids' throat).", "It was both her and my (other) uncle who did it.

The odds of him not dating in 20+ years because of his 8yo are minimal.\n\nLiam is an adult and the parent.  It was his choice.  Child Ben is not accountable for that choice, nor is now Adult Ben.\n\nAunt would have been an AH for confronting Ben or even raising it with him no matter where she did it.

Sorry it happened at your wedding.", "Yeah, I, I was really struggling with whether I was wrong for how I felt about that. Like I know generally you don't do that stuff at someone else's party.

They have emotions and opinions about this topic but grounded and unselfish adults practice delay acting-on emotions.

If you do, only you suffer. \n\nAgain, sorry this selfish & hurtful act occurred. Even if people diminish it due to 'years of frustration, use of alcohol/substances, etc'; people are still responsible for their actions.  Ironically, the topic is none of their business; a son and father discussed a topic. The father should be respected for his decision. No one have the right to judge his life.

It was very disrespectful your aunt and uncle to bring this up at your wedding, causing such a disruption that they had to be removed.

It\u2019s a very private issue between a man and his son and it doesn\u2019t need to involve the entire family. I totally understand that Liam didn\u2019t want to disturb young 7yo Ben who had just lost his mom by starting to date again, and it\u2019s weird that your aunt and uncle were apparently upset by that at the time. Putting off dating again for a bit longer to let your 7yo heal from his loss seems to me like a reasonable decision, you shouldn\u2019t resent the child in that situation. However I do find it surprising that this was never reevaluated as Ben got older, became independent and started his own family. But at the end of the day, that is Liam\u2019s life, he\u2019s a grown man, he can make his own decisions. Unless he personally was frustrated by the situation, had tried to talk to his son to no avail and had asked his brother and sister to step in as a last resort to try to make his son understand his point of view\u2026 that is none of their business.\n\nIn any case, your wedding was certainly NOT a good time to bring that (or any other family drama) up.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that happened to you and I hope you were still able to enjoy your day.

Probably weren't prepared to have to do that, though, which is understandable.", "NTA for you but ESH for everyone else in the story. Ben for still making his dad honor this stupid promise. Liam for allowing an 8/9 year old dictate his life, he was obviously lonely and ready to move on but never did to please his son. The aunts and uncles for butting in. Ugh they\u2019re all so messy. Although I\u2019ll say this I\u2019d probably just as pissed at Ben if my sibling was miserable to please an entitled bratty 30 year old", "NTA - (extremely ridiculous) issue aside, they did not have to do that during your wedding. Who's \"side\" you're on has nothing to do with whether or not it was appropriate to act like that during your wedding. \n\nIf they can't separate the two issues, that says a lot about them as people. But, carrying this kind of grudge for so long also says a lot about them as people.", "NTA\n\nEven though your aunt and uncle might have the best of intentions, it's really none of their business. They never should have brought their drama to your wedding, and they owe you an apology. You do care about Liam. You care that he's an adult, perfectly capable of making his own decisions about his life. \n\nIf they won't apologize I'd go LC with them until they do. What they did was absolutely wrong.", "NTA. If they really wanted to have that conversation (which in all honesty, is none of their business, AND he was a kid), it should have been held a long time ago in a different place. Extremely inappropriate on their end.", "OMG talk about a petty thing to be upset about 25 years later. Ugh. I'm annoyed for you, OP. NTA", "NTA.\nLiam is/was ridiculous to allow Ben to control his life.\n\nBen is a a selfish jerk to not encourage his dad to date (after a couple years).\n\nAunt & uncle are definitely TA. In what world is it okay to make a family scene at a wedding?!?\n\nSend them an invoice for the reception- if they think it was an appropriate place to discuss personal opinions, they should pay for it.", "NTA at all. But I'm assuming this is a typo here, and you meant to say \"Liam mentioned dating again\"?\n\n>At some point a year or two after Liam's wife passed away, Ben had mentioned maybe dating again to his siblings", "NTA. It may have started as a way to keep Ben's life as comfortable as possible but at some point, Liam has the right to move on if he so chooses. He didn't. That became his (and *only* his) choice years and years ago. your family is holding on to anger that was directed at a grieving child who lost their mother. That's preposterous on so many levels. \n\nYour aunt and uncle not only owe you a huge apology, but also Ben (along with his family) and Liam for sticking their nose in where it wasn't requested (assuming there was no point where Liam expressed continued heartbreak from loneliness since Ben became an adult). Liam is a grown man and father and can make his own choices, whatever they may be inspired by.", "They should be ashamed of themselves. A wedding is not the place to sort these things out. \n\nEven if Ben said no to his dad dating, that does not mean that this was the only reason Liam didn\u2019t want to date. People can be perfectly happy without having romantic relationships. Liam has his son, and his grandkids, and other family to fulfil him. \n\nNTA.", "NTA block these people", "NTA\n\nWhat assholes to begrudge a child an honest opinion. What assholes to hold on to that grudge for 25 years and then choose your wedding as the time to confront a now adult about a justifiable childhood request\u2014that his father didn\u2019t have to honor.\n\nNone of these decisions were theirs. They didn\u2019t and don\u2019t get a vote. \n\nWhat assholes.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t speak to either again until they apologized publicly to you, your husband, their nephew and their brother. \n\nWhatever Ben said and whatever Liam chose to do is not their business. What a couple of self righteous assholes they are.", "All they can see is red. They don't give a shit about your wedding, it's all about their \"righteous anger\". They are literally blinded by it - so much, in fact, that when confronted with their appalling behavior, their takeaway is that you're \"not on their side\"! Your special day being shit on by them is the least of their concerns. You are not dealing with rational people. \n\nNTA but aunt and uncle definitely are.", "You are NTA. Your aunt and uncle are totally unhinged assholes who should never be invited to polite society gatherings again. If your uncle Liam really wanted to date and have a new romantic partner, he would have. Clearly, he was fine without one and seems content to dance with his grandkids. It's absolutely none of their business, they had no excuse to attack their nephew, and I'm thoroughly sick of people calling other people \"selfish\" when they disagree with something that's none of their business or don't get something they are not entitled to.", "NTA. This is a poor reflection on your aunt. It's none of her business why Liam hasn't dated. If he didn't want to date because of his son, that's his choice. His son really isn't preventing it.", "Well , it\u2019s not a wedding (birthday, Christening, Thanksgiving, Christmas, BBQ) if there isn\u2019t at least one family fight/drama. \ud83d\ude0e. At least, not in my family.  But as to your question, OP - NTA.  Your wedding wasn\u2019t the place for this family fight, and your aunt and uncle should be ashamed of themselves for ruining your reception.", "A wedding is not where you bring up such grievances.  That could have been done at any other time, so why wait until a wedding to do it?  NTA.  The uncle and aunt owe you and your husband apologies along with both sets of parents.", "NTA. Aunt & uncle have just disinvited themselves from any future family gathering.", " NTA. Your family behaved terribly. You were right to request an apology.", "NTA. I would be willing to bet Ben is low or no contact with the aunt and this was her \"big chance\" to give him a piece of her mind about A THING HE SAID WHEN HE WAS 9. What an utterly unhinged person.", "Dang that\u2019s some juicy gossip. I almost needed a drink listening to this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur aunt and uncle are the AHs here, they are intruding into someone else's life decissions .. and were causing a ruckus at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nThere's plenty of time before or after the wedding to hash out this things they didn't need to ruin your party in order to do it", "NTA\n\nWhile they can have an issue with it, they had no right to cause a scene at your wedding", "NTA- WTAF are these ppl doing having a 20 y/o argument at your wedding?  Grow\ud83d\udc4fUp\ud83d\udc4f", "I almost feel NAH here...its sucks that this bubbled up at your wedding... and i defiantly agree this was not the time or place for this argument....but i also get your aunts anger...its misplaced..but i get it...seeing ben dance away with his wife while liam is old and alone all because ben said no to liam dating would cause some anger.  I dont blame bem for not wanting his mom replaced as a 7 year old...i guess the only question is is ben to blame or liam for liam being single...a 7 year old cant be held accountable for a 7 year olds understanding of a complex issue...so did ben continue saying i dont want my dad to date into his adult years or did liam take a 7 year olds answer and decide to live by that answer for the rest of his life? Either way...it sucks that i bubbled up at your wedding...but i cant really call them AH for an emotional outburst either....aunt should apologize though for the result of her outburst", "To be fair, Ben never had any say really. As a child, he couldn\u2019t dictate to his father not to date. He simply expressed that his preference was that his father not. \n\nLiam, as the adult, made the choice to put his son\u2019s comfort over his own desires. He chose and continues to choose not to date. That\u2019s his prerogative. It\u2019s weird that Liam\u2019s brother and sister are so offended by this when it doesn\u2019t impact them at all.", "You bring up a good point here - were the aunt and uncle invited to Ben's wedding?  Why would they not choose to cause a scene then?\n\nYou're not TA, OP.  Your aunt and uncle definitely are.  Maybe Liam feels like he's too old to date at this point.  Maybe he is perfectly content spending time with his son and his grandchildren.  I would find it strange that after all these years Ben has never encouraged his father to date, especially after falling in love with his own wife but, that is no one's business but Liam and Ben's.  If Liam is happy that is all that matters.", "They seem to think they were perfectly within their rights to do it there and then, hence their issue. Inflated sense of entitlement will do that to you. They definitely owe an apology but whether or not OP will get one is another issue. Still, good excuse for her to cut contact. NTA", "Tbf OP hasn\u2019t said that he\u2019s still discouraging it. The post could be read that Ben didn\u2019t want his dad to date when he was 9 and there hasn\u2019t been a conversation about it since then at all.", "Do we know that? All we know is Ben's opinion when he was 8/9 years old, just a couple of years after losing his mother. Liam accepted it and may never have brought it up again. It's entirely possible that Ben would be fine with Liam dating now, he might have been fine with it for the past 15+ years.", "Honestly, it doesn\u2019t seem that weird. It would be weird if he were still actively discouraging it, but if he\u2019s just not actively encouraging it that could just be Ben being a reasonable and respectful adult. \n\nBy all accounts he\u2019s very close to his father and knows him well. His father hasn\u2019t dated in over two decades and apparently has stated even in more recent years that it isn\u2019t worth the trouble. It just doesn\u2019t sound like the father actually WANTS to date. It seems like he is probably getting active encouragement to date from everyone else in his family, so he might appreciate his son respecting his choices.", ">I know they just want their brother to be happy.\n\nAre you really sure they want him to be happy? Or do they just want their expectations to be filled? Are they just upset that Liam dared to be a single father and that Ben grew up without a \"proper\" mother and \"HOW DARE\" anyone go against their advice and wants?\n\nNTA but their anger *doesn't* come from love, it comes from someone defying them.", "sounds like you should go LC with them since they refuse to change and are willing to do what they did, especially considering that it was also your uncle Liam's decision to respect his son's wishes and not date(which could also mean that your uncle didn't really want to date and his moments of seeming lonely could also be him missing his late wife and thinking about their time together)", "Ben still doesn\u2019t want his dad to date.  I\u2019m pissed at Ben, and I don\u2019t even know him.  I would be livid at him if I was sibling of liam\u2019s.  That\u2019s their brother, whom they love.  Liam deserves to find love and not be alone.  His adult kid with a family needs to stop being a selfish, entitled brat and give his father the permission he obviously needs to be happy and at peace.\n\nA wedding is not the appropriate place to have this conversation.", "I guess they don't believe in phones, emails, chat messages, video calls, snail mail? They ignored all of the ways to properly communicate their frustrations & let it stew for 14+ years until the day of your wedding? A wedding is NOT a family reunion; there's etiquette that should be upheld at a wedding & your aunt & uncle completely ignored it DURING your wedding (not after the reception or even the day after).", "For good reason...... This is sociopathic and unhindged behaviour.", "It's entirely possible that Ben hasn't even thought about the topic for 20 years at this point. Liam might just not have asked again, but if he'd asked when Ben was 16 Ben might have been fine with it (not that I think a 16 year old should really hold any sway in the overall decision anyway)", "It is wild to me how they're completely ignoring Liam's agency in all this. He was and is an adult; it is his prerogative to decide whether to date or not regardless of the reasoning he uses or who influenced his decision. It's bizarre that they're so worked up over a decision HE made about HIS life to the point they would blame and harbor genuine anger for his son.", "Do you know if Ben actually still _is_ discouraging his father dating, or is the latest opinion that of a 8 year old Ben who'd recently lost his mother?\n\nFor example, was the topic revisited by Liam when Ben was 12? 16? 18? 25? Not that Ben's opinion on the matter should matter by that point. Or did Liam just simply not date after Ben said what he said when he was 8, and hasn't stopped since?", "I suspect they (TA aunt/uncle) gor way to drunk and chose (verbal) violence", "OP states that Ben, at 32, is STILL discouraging his father from dating, tho. they're holding a grudge because Ben is being selfish and possessive as a full-grown adult. OP is NTA, obviously, but Ben is an AH too", "It's extremely odd for the aunt and uncle to harbour such viscous anger at Ben. \n\nOf course as a young child he's going to say he's uncomfortable about the idea of his dad dating, no 8/9 year old wants their mother to be replaced. \nThat his dad has remained single for 25 years isn't his fault at all. \n\nI think some people make up scenarios in their own heads and let that shit fester until they just have to let it out, even when it's really none of their business. If they wanted Liam to date in the years since, why not talk to him about it, instead of ruining a wedding and going ballistic at Ben.", "Why are you assuming Ben still feels the same way he did as a child? The impression I got was that Liam never talked about it again and continues acting based on the words of an 8 year old.", "Found the aunt/uncle.", "There's a high chance that Ben never even asked this and Liam just said that he did so that his siblings would get off his back. Some people don't want to date again after their spouse passes and that's okay.", "Even so, nothing is stopping Liam from dating. He\u2019s an adult and is capable of fighting his own battles. If this was something important to him, wouldn\u2019t he speak to his son himself? Why would he need to siblings to white knight for him? \n\nBen can not want his father to date. He\u2019s definitely a selfish AH for it. But at the end of the day what\u2019s Ben going to do, lock his father in his house so he can\u2019t leave to go on dates? Turn off the wifi at his father\u2019s house so online dating is inaccessible? It\u2019s all absurd.", "Probably, but that's still their fault. Who holds on to resentment for someone else for decades when that person never cared in thr first place. \n\nI've heard horror stories of people telling a widow at the funeral of their spouse they need to get back out their. None of their fuckign business no matter how \"well meanjng\" they are.", "You;re not being selfish. Even if they strongly beleived that this was their business to stick their nose into (debatable), they\u2019ve had 25 YEARS to say their piece. Why now? Why your wedding? Why not Christmas, or their own birthday dinners, or some random no-reason get together? Why not a kind email to let Ben know that his father has spent 25 years living up to a promise that he made to his 7y/o self? Its entirely possible that the subject hasn\u2019t been raised again since that initial conversation, that Ben doesn\u2019t even remember saying that and has spent the majority of his life thinking that his father just\u2026 isnt interested in dating. Maybe Liam is scared and has found it easier to attribute his lack of a love life to keeping his promise. Who knows?\n\ni dont  know if it was the booze flowing that loosened their lips, or watching Ben dance with the wife he loves, or watching Liam dancing with children instead of a love of his own, but either way they could have kept that shit to themselves for ONE more night. Just one. They are massive assholes, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you one bit if you chose not to be involved with them anymore.", "No it's not selfish. Why would you want your family to implode your happy day?! Also WTF is wrong with your aunt and uncle harboring such resentment towards a kid who was scared at the thought of his dad dating at 8-9 years old. Surely Ben didnt keep that strong sentiment and him and his dad get on right?", "You have every right to be mad at everybody involved. It ultimately doesn't matter who is right or who is wrong. They decided to bring their issues to a boiling point at your wedding, that's neither the time or place. I wouldn't invite anybody who doesn't apologize to another event you're hosting. NTA.", "Absolutely not  selfish", "Wedding reception parties exist to serve as a celebration of the newly married couple and for all attendees to have a good time. Your aunt and uncle chose your day, your venue, your party, etc. to start a family fight. That is downright hateful.\n\nIf they gave you a wedding gift, in your shoes I might very publicly return it to them.", "Sounds like Ben still has issues with his dad dating.", "Where does OP say that?\n\nThe closest thing I could find was an implication the subject hadn't been revisited since Ben was young. Nothing to confirm or deny that Ben is still requesting Liam to not date. \n\n\"an 8/9 year old Ben had asked his dad not to date and that Liam listened and had never dated since his wife died.\"", "That\u2019s not what OP has said at all. All they said is that Ben isn\u2019t actively encouraging his dad to date. Those are different things.", "It would be more properly place to be angry at Liam at this point for not actively filling the loneliness in his life... but if he isn't unhappy.. its a non-issue", "> he knows Liam hasn't dated and still doesn't encourage it.\n\nI think we can all read between the lines here.  Ben is withholding his approval of his dad moving on."]}
