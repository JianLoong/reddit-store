I wasn\u2019t mad (and we both spoke calmly the whole time) but I said she probably shouldn\u2019t dance with other men (I pointed out that asking someone to dance is like asking if you can buy them a drink- it\u2019s often, especially for men, a way to hit on them). I told her I wasn\u2019t mad, I love her, and every was okay. I just would prefer she not dance with other guys. \n\nMy wife is very distraught now. She feels like she should have known better and feels foolish. I told her she shouldn\u2019t feel foolish. I wasn\u2019t mad, everything is fine.

Many people, probably including your wife, see dancing as something innocent. That's okay.\nYou see it differently and explained in a respectful way your point of view. Your wife seems to accept your point of view. So that's okay too.\nI don't understand your problem, but that's not important. Your marriage, your decision.", "Info: Do you dance with her?", "NAH. I think both of you are having perfectly normal reactions. However, just because a reaction is normal doesn't mean it needs to be acted on. I think you should keep a few things in mind. Do you trust your wife to have the judgment to determine if a guy is hitting on her or just being friendly? If you trust her judgment, then SHOW that you trust her to know the difference and to be able to handle herself if she misjudges and realizes a guy is hitting on her. Social dance is a thing that some people do, especially in older generations. It's just a friendly interaction, not necessarily a come on. Even in younger groups there are social dance gatherings (I used to go to some with my old roommate who was big into west coast swing and blues dancing) where everyone dances with anyone.", "You are going to get divided opinions here. Partner dancing can be completely platonic and nothing more, but some people just don't like the thought of other people touching their significant other. My married friend goes out dancing with other people all the time because her husband hates dancing. He is fine with it since he knows she always loved dancing, and he knows its nothing more beyond that. It really depends on the person. If you don't want your wife to dance with other people, you should just to let her know what you do or don't feel comfortable with.", "NAH. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal at all for a partner to casually dance with someone else, especially someone so much older, but you\u2019re allowed to have your boundaries. I\u2019m glad you reassured your wife that you\u2019re not mad and she wasn\u2019t foolish, and as long as she\u2019s ok with this boundary, I think it\u2019s a good example of communication in a relationship.", "Nah, but I think it depends on the type of dancing that is being done whether it is appropriate for a married person to participate in.", "NAH. You had a conversation about something your aren\u2019t comfortable with, she seems to agree. Just buy her flowers and have a date night to reassure you both it\u2019s not a huge deal.", "NAH.

She didn't really do anything wrong, you just would like to establish this boundary. You aren't really wrong for that either.

No one did anything wrong.", "INFO: have you expressed this boundary previously or talked about anything you wouldn't like her doing with other men?", "NTA - you let her know something that bothered you, calmly and without yelling at or belittling her. You even tried to make sure she knew you weren't mad. \n\nAll these people act like having things bother you is always an insecurity, its not. You are allowed to feel the way you feel, even if others don't agree that they would see it that way. \n\nPeople don't always know what is an issue for them til it comes up.

Many people dance purely for the enjoyment they get from that specific action. Completely non-sexual.\n\nI do not like to dance. AT ALL. Never have. But I have never in the 30+ years of being with my wife stopped her from dancing, because she enjoys it and I would be an asshole if I prevented her from doing something she enjoyed.", "Is there even a conflict here?", "YTA. But not for getting jealous and expressing how you feel - but instead for not attending events like this with her and being her dancing partner yourself. There's no one she'd rather dance with than you - the  man she loves.

I just honestly consider it a pretty weird preference\u2014people dance platonically all the time, in almost every culture. It\u2019s just a way to have fun, and if someone views your wife as flirting with them when she isn\u2019t, that\u2019s their problem, not hers or yours.

She\u2019s not going to do anything improper, right?", "NTA. She danced with another guy and you said you\u2019d prefer she not.

Unless she was grinding away in his lap, she did nothing wrong.", "NTA  \nEveryone has boundaries and you stated yours in a calm and fair way.\n\nMy gf and i do dance as a hobby and when we talked about it we agreeed that dancing (for us) is something personal that we shouldnt do with others so i can understand your point somewhat", "NTA.You didn't feel comfortable with the idea. You communicated that, and she understood.  That's called communication, compromising, and growth in a relationship.", "YTA.\n\nDancing doesn't have to be the same as flirting. A lot of people just like dancing. She didn't see it as flirting until you brought it up.", "NTA, and the amount of mental gymnastics going on to paint you as one has me hoping the morons in this thread stretched first.", "You're both very sweet. NAH\nShe shouldn't be upset, you can't mark boundaries without finding them. I dance with people all the time because it's fun and I like to dance, now you've told her how you feel you should pick up and move on.", "YTA. \n\nShe wants to dance! And a dance is nothing more than that. She's been quite open about what she's been doing, and I imagine the guy she danced with didn't have any illusions about things. He just wanted to dance with somebody.", "NTA.   Communication is key.   If it bothered you you should talk about it.    Just like she should talk to you about what bothers you.   You said you didn't yell or wasn't mad just communicated what you felt which is what every decent relationship needs.", "Honestly idk, when I go out dancing I mainly only dance with girls because when you dance with guys most of the time the thing ends up escalating and then I have to ask a friend to get him away from me because they do not want to move or have a strong grip on my waist and so on. For me, I wouldn't dance with a guy if I had a bf not because I would do anything but mainly cause I don't trust the guy and so on I rather dance with close friends . I think it's a very grey area situation.", "NAH- you calmly told her the reality of the situation (men use it as a way to hit on a woman) and how it made you feel. You asked her politely not to do it again. I don\u2019t see any belittling happening. \n\nI\u2019m a married woman and I would feel uncomfortable dancing with another man as that is very flirtatious (at least the kind of dancing I like to do \ud83d\ude02). Dancing with girlfriends is different and I\u2019d feel upset if my husband had a problem with that, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s been an issue for you.\n\nSounds like you two addressed the concern in a respectful way and that you care deeply for one another.", "YTA- my husband loves to dance, my back & hip won\u2019t allow it.\nI tell him go, have fun!\nThat\u2019s all it is, get out of the 1950\u2019s!", "Yta you could have told her that sometimes others may view an invitation to dance as more then just a dance. She is 29 and I find it hard to believe she doesn\u2019t know that already. \nYou need to look at yourself and really consider if your view was to protect her or came from a place of insecurity. \nYou should also consider why you think a 29 year old woman is that dumb she needs you to educate her. Most females realize that by high school. \nYou say you didn\u2019t want her to feel bad I don\u2019t agree that was your intention because you don\u2019t want her out dancing with others.", "YTA. \n\nWhat? Who taught you this? Her dancing with someone means no obligation, neither does buying anyone a drink.\n\nYou have a really weird perception of reality. Perhaps you expect more for a dance and a drink but not everyone is like that. Do some self-reflection and apologize do your wife.", "When a boundary is used to control someone else it is not a heartily boundary it is a controlling behavior, \nWorks your reaction be the same to a wife having a boundary of I don\u2019t mind you going out to dinner with the guys or to golf play ball but men that go to bars with other men usually go to find girls so I do not want you going to any bars unless I am with. Is that okay too?", "Depends on your motivation for saying it.\n\nIf it\u2019s because you\u2019re jealous and insecure, then definitely Y T A\n\nIf you did it out of concern for her safety, N T A. (I have put myself in possibly dangerous situations out of na\u00efvet\u00e9, and my husband has explained to me why he worried) If that\u2019s the case you absolutely need to explain that to her to alleviate her guilt.

Comfort your wife and make sure she knows she did not fuck up.", "NAH  in general because you both spoke calmly about establishing boundaries. But in my book YTA because i dance tango as a hobby and we change partners every 3 songs. That\u2019s the etiquette. So, to me a dance is just a dance. Especially in a bar with someone old enough to be her dad. Dancing doesn\u2019t have to be romantic, it can just be for fun, you can dance with relatives, dates, friends, etc. \n\nSure if a guy is hitting on her and grinding on her, she should (and I assume would) extricate herself from that situation. But jus having fun in a bar isn\u2019t a problem.", "I don't think you're an asshole, but what I think you're forgetting is that people will hit on her whether or not she dances with someone, but that doesn't mean she's gonna flirt back or accept it. \nEveryone has their limits in a relationship,  I do think it's odd you two are married and this hasn't come up, which makes me think she doesn't do this very often and doesn't mean anything to her. \nIf that's your line, then if she wants to be in a relationship with you, she has to respect that.", "INFO:\nDo you ever dance with your wife?", "INFO: Her reaction does not seem congruent with the way you told the story. Have you had this discussion before? Was she trying to bang the guy or was this some innocent line dance with a grandpa?", "YTA. She danced with him, she didn't give him a blow. And you've clearly upset her. Also I have SERIOUS doubts whenever someone says \"we both spoke calmly\" and the next phrase is \"she is distraught\".", "YTA dancing doesn't have to be sexual. It's something fun that humans do. It's only sexual if you make it that way. Let her have fun.", "NAH. But for all these YTA commenters, imagine if the roles were switched. OP was a woman, who\u2019s husband danced with an older woman. Would you be saying that he\u2019s the AH?", "Wow, this is an interesting one. I think the way you handled the situation sounds great, very mature and you and your partner should be proud to communicate in such a easy and calm manner. But OP I do think it\u2019s worth inspecting why you feel that way about the dancing? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong to have a boundary but based on the way you communicate, the obvious love you have for your wife, and her response to the situation it sounds like a trusting relationship, so why put a condition on her actions, why not let her make the best judgement in a given situation? I do agree with other comments that seeing dancing as exclusively sexual in nature is a bit short sighted considering the vastly different situations to be found in your average bar or club. Dancing with a grandpa and the kiddos as a local band plays a country fair is very different from grinding in a late light club. Idk just something to consider. No assholes here to me!", "YTA. Dancing can be JUST dancing. It isn't always a pickup line, or sexual.  Some people like to dance and don't have a partner, so they ask someone.  The key is simply for your wife to gauge the situation and possible intent, and accept or decline accordingly, and letting them know she's married if she does accept.", "NAH but I think it's weird that youre threatened by other men because she stood in a spot and danced by them lol do you think that old man is dry humping her on the dance floor or something? Also let men buy her drinks less on your bank accounts and most of the time she doesnt even have to speak to them after", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult woman, she herself should be able to decide what\u2019s a good idea or not. If there\u2019s other people around the guy won\u2019t try anything. \n\nA guy 60+ should know better than to think a woman under 30 is hitting on him, too. He probably did.", "YTA- grow up! It\u2019s a dance!", "YTA.  She obviously didn't do anything transgressive, so you sound threatened by the fact that she danced more than anything.  Trust me, if you're a female, you're well aware very early on that men can and do use almost any excuse to make advances on women - but at the same time there are also plenty of people out there who don't have an agenda and just want to enjoy themselves when they go out - like, for example, your wife.  Let your wife use her own judgement, especially when you aren't even there!  Jeebus.", "YTA", "YTA. Your wife is a grown woman and can look after herself. For long periods of history, it was considered in very poor taste for women to dance in public *with* their husbands. I'm sure she would have declined if she had felt that she was being hit on, but as it is you sound needlessly possessive over an innocent dance with a man old enough to be her father.", "Don't be so insecure is my advice", "YTA.\n\nIt's dancing, nothing more. \nDon't make it about sex. That's a leap. It's not about intimacy.\n\nThis is your own insecurity speaking. \n\nIf YOU can't dance with a woman without it being, or getting sexual, that's YOU. \nDont project that onto everyone else. \nThere are many people who dance, just enjoy the music and the dance, all sexes, all races, all music types... \n\nYou making her feel \"like she should have known better\" and she's feeling \"foolish\"?\nThat's mentally abusive. You dumped your shit onto her, and had her carry that weight, in no way should she know better or feel foolish. \nShe was DANCING, bro. Apologize for freaking out. Apologize for gaslighting her into feeling it was all her fault for daring to dance. Your issues... YOURS. She didn't do ANYTHING wrong, and likely won't ever be able to fully just enjoy going out to dance ever again without your insecurities in her head, afraid to hurt your feelings, displease you, or cross some weird imaginary line. Even with an apology, that's what's going to happen. Congratulations, you permanently tainted an activity your girl enjoys for no legit reason. \nMake it up to her, Apologize, and maybe next time THINK before you lose your cool.", "YTA. It was just a dance and not a slow dance. Very common at country western bars. My husband doesn't dance, but that doesn't stop me from dancing. Its a dance.

Unless you're a woman then you go sis /s", "YTA especially if it was country music, a lot of people go out just to dance and it's fun to dance with lots of different people. It depends on the situation but it sounds like it was innocent, why make her feel bad?", "Married 28yrs., Together 30yrs. She shouldn't feel bed or embarrassed. Marriage is a never ending journey of growth, understanding each other and creating your mutual story. Indeed, I wouldn't \"want\" to go anywhere socially without my wife.

You shamed her for no good reason.", "NTA man and she seems a keeper.", "NAH\n\nDancing with others is often perfectly innocent, however you have the right to make that a boundary for yourself. It's unfortunate your wife is upset but as long as you didn't yell at her or degrade her in some way I don't see any issue in this seemingly healthy adult discussion.", "yep yta\n\neta: having been to many bars with live music I can tell you when you're in a bar with live music, people are going to dance. often random people will dance with each other which these days is jogging in place to the beat. it's social, it isn't sexual.\n\nyou're showing you don't trust your wife and you don't believe in her loyalty to you, so you have to impose \"boundaries\" on her. You will never trust her no matter what, because she's not a dog or sheep.", "YTA. Dancing is dancing. Normal people do not see dancing as sexual unless it is overtly intentionally done so. Would you get mad if she was in a tightly packed club and just so happened to be around other men? What if you found out they were gay men? Or another woman? Would you be mad then? Are you insecure about the relationship?\n\nYou\u2019ve just told her what to think and how to feel about something harmless and normal, because you don\u2019t like it. Making boundaries is not controlling other people\u2019s behaviour, but altering your own in response to it. Now she\u2019s anxious over it, as you\u2019ve stated in the comments. You told her you weren\u2019t mad, you still lover her and that everything (the relationship) is okay, as if her dancing normally was almost a threat to the relationship. \n\nWhat else are you going to tell her isn\u2019t okay, make her anxious and then tell her how you still love her, everything is okay, until she is afraid to do something without your permission? \n\nThe fact that she felt compelled to tell you that she danced normally, with who happened to be a man, is interesting. Why is she coming to you for validation over normal behaviour? People dance to music.", "YTA - this is the exact misogyny that has been so oppressive for women for centuries!!! You need to trust your WIFE! Not the guy she danced with!!; It's not her problem if the man sees it one way or another! She was accepting an invitation to DANCE nothing more!!! This is the type of thing that leads to victim blaming. If, god forbid,that man assaulted her, if we kept this attitude, people would say \"well she shouldn't have danced with him\" etc etc! Thats not right. \n\nNot to mention the fact that this is a subtle control issue too! There's just common sense around all this, you can't tell her not to dance with anyone !!! You have no right! You can tell her you'd prefer if she didn't but you can't tell her what and what not to do!", "I think women should dance if they want to. We don't need to manage men's feelings -- if she was with a friend and felt safe, why should she not dance? \n\nYTA -- and not for discouraging her from dancing, but what is the atmosphere in your home that she is now distraught over what you describe as a calm conversation?", "YTA. Your wife should be free to have a fun evening without being made to feel guilty about it. It's not like she had sex with someone else. It was just a dance.

Apparently your ego is so fragile you cannot handle your wife dancing with someone who might consider her attractive. \n\nYou say you feel bad, but do you?", "YTA. You yourself said it wasn't a slow dance or anything intimate. \n\nAlso, usually ladies and men if they go to dance classes they have to dance with strangers.

It is completely platonic and part of the dance culture.", "\u201cShe said it wasn\u2019t a slow dance\u201d", "It says in the post \u201cshe said it wasn\u2019t a slow dance\u201d", "In a mature relationship you don't just spill all your feelings and thought, because some are bullshit.\n\nIf I have immature jealousy thoughts I keep them to myself, because I know they are bullshit. \n\nIf I have a bad day I get angry at random things, I don't pour my bad mood on my partner. Because that doesn't help anybody and would be bullshit behavior. \n\nIf I have some legit concern about something where it makes sense to share, then I share it. Because there is some real outcome.\n\nThere is a difference between sharing every bjllshit thought and feeling, and having a mature conversation about legit problems.\n\nA partner dancing with somebody else is not a legit problem.", "I really really really wish people would learn what boundaries are. Boundaries are your own rules for yourself. They may include behavior you will or won\u2019t accept in your relationships, but that looks like \u201cI won\u2019t be with a woman who dance with other men, period.\u201d If that is his boundary, then fine, but that would mean that he sees it as enough of a problem that he would take protective actions in their relationship over it (namely leaving the relationship). If he\u2019s telling her not to dance with other men ever, that\u2019s a rule set by him for her to follow. Not a boundary for him to follow.", "That's not a boundary. Sigh ....\nA boundary is not something you put on someone else. \" Don't dance with other men\" is not a boundary.\n\n\" I don't want to be with someone who dances innocently with other men and if you do I will take x action to protect myself\" is a boundary. A ridiculous one, but still. \n\nOP should have expressed his insecurities to his wife and allowed her to reassure him. He instead shamed her for doing harmless and made it the equivalent of flirting ( which is.....not a thing where I'm from).", "What is the problem, when dancing? I mean real dancing. Jive, Discofox, Waltz...", ">engaging in potentially romantic behavior\n\nWith that definition the sole act of speaking to another person could be considered \"potentially romantic\".

That's a way bigger issue than your wife dancing.", "many men actually aren't fuckboys", "You\u2019re on Reddit not in an etiquette class.

Are you one of those who believe men and women can't be friends as well?\n\nShe hadn't even considered that it could have been flirting. So it boils down to three possible reasons. \n\n1. You don't trust her.\n2. You care too much about what others think.\n3. You think of her as a possession of yours.\n\nAll three of which are you-problems. Which one is it that your ego has problems dealing with?", "Better watch out! The dancing men are going to come for your woman!", "there are so many kinds of dancing, you're going to have to be specific here", "I don\u2019t know who else you\u2019re referring to, but I never disrespected you. \n\nIn any case, I\u2019m not talking about those dances you mentioned.

If it is a form of dancing event, where a dancing partner is required; that\u2019s completely different.\n\nEdit:  to address your question of why it is an appropriate. It\u2019s telling the other person that you\u2019re available. You should not be getting off those types of vibes when you are in a relationship.\n\nIf a man asks you to dance and you accept, then he\u2019s going to think you\u2019re a possible romantic prospect. She shouldn\u2019t need another man in order to have a good time.

You don\u2019t have to agree, and having feelings doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "I just looked up boundary and corrected it. For me I see him bringing it up as a rule for both of them to follow.", "Exactly. It's a rule.", "Thats a different type of dancing that what I think is happening in a bar.

You don\u2019t have to make every issue you have your partners problem to fix. If you\u2019re having an irrational emotional reaction and you know that, the best thing you can do is try to figure out why you feel that way and work past it to just let it go. I don\u2019t want my partner to feel like they need to stop doing perfectly normal, innocent things that they enjoy just bc I have a weird hang up about it. So my first reaction would be to try to work thru that myself in my head. If I\u2019m truly unable to let it go and it just *bothers* me, like a lot, I\u2019d be very apologetic about it. I\u2019d acknowledge he did nothing wrong or bad, but this thing is really bothering me and I keep trying to not let it bother me but I just can\u2019t, so I would really appreciate it if you\u2019d consider not doing this thing anymore or changing how you do it, whatever.\n\nOP didn\u2019t try to get past it, he immediately went with his initial reaction. He phrased it like she did something she shouldn\u2019t have done and should have known better than to do. Then he told her not to do it anymore. No, dude. If you really can\u2019t let it go, then you tell her you know this is a you problem, and you *ask* her to alter her behavior for your sake, basically as a favor to you, not bc she\u2019s doing anything wrong.", "She said it wasn't a slow dance.
