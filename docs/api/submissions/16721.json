He was 32 dating a 21 year old. Already a red flag. Now at 41 he was cheating for months with a 19yo. Then his reaction sealed the deal for me. I wouldn't go either. Neither should your sister, lol", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t support this wedding either! He sounds creepy and if she goes through with it, I don\u2019t see a bright future ahead for them", "NTA\n\nYea you are being unsupportive... to a man and relationship who DOES NOT deserve anyone's support. Your sister needs to wake up and not marry this predator. He not only cheated, but he cheated with a 19 year old. There are so many red flags I don't know how this is even up for discussion.", "So he was 32 and she was 21 when they started dating. Now he's living a \"double-life\" with a 19yo. This dude is a clich\u00e9. Why in the world would you support that? NTA.", "NTA but if you are the ONLY one in your family concerned about this despite the fact he can be described, understandably, as \"a max predator\", there are other serious issues on top of your sister's future.", "NTA for not attending, but stay in touch with your sister and let her know she can ALWAYS come to you in the hopes that she wants better for herself someday.", "NTA. Your never required to attend a wedding, an invitation isn\u2019t a summons. \n\nThat said This will cause problems and may create a permanent rift with your sister. If your willing to live with that then don\u2019t attend.\n\nJust keep in mind She may need your support when things almost inevitably fall apart so try to keep the lines of communication open. Let her know you love her but you can\u2019t support him and everything he\u2019s done. Try to explain things from your perspective, don\u2019t be accusatory or demeaning, just clear and loving, a letter or email would probably help. You can write out your feelings and she can digest it without lashing out at you immediately and causing a fight.\n\nThat\u2019s my best recommendation, hope it works out well for you whatever you decide", "NTA. However, deciding not to attend the wedding might cause your sister to cut you out of her life. With a husband so clearly manipulative and amoral, she\u2019ll likely need all the support she can get. This guy has already exhibited abusive behaviors. Marriage won\u2019t cure that; if anything, it\u2019ll make him worse once she\u2019s legally tied to him. So you\u2019re NTA, but consider that your sister will likely need a support system down the line.", "NTA\n\nBut I would send a card to her. Simple, not too long a letter. Just something saying I will be there for you when you need me. No judgement. No I told you so. I love you.", "NTA - Yeah, the family that is calling you out for being unsupportive is hilarious. You are legit concerned for your sister who is marrying a known cheater. Someone who is a predator.", "Is your sister the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz? Because she clearly doesn\u2019t have a brain. NTA, but your sister and her future ex-husband are.", "NTA. You're not obliged to pretend to celebrate your sister marrying someone who treats her like crap. There's nothing \"supportive\" about ignoring mistreatment.\n\nYears ago, I decide not to attend the wedding of a close friend under very similar circumstances. I knew I'd be unable to feign happiness at her marrying that creep. Lucky for everyone, she wised up before it was too late.\n\nOf course, if this guy is loaded & your sister wants to ride a gravy train, that'd be worth celebrating. That's exactly what a creep cheating with a woman half his age deserves.", "NTA\nIt's totally valid to not attend her wedding of you don't support their marriage. But you should offer her help in case she wants to break up.", "YTA. Though your family is wrong about your motives. You don't want to go and imply that your presence means that you approve of the wedding. I get that but reconsider.\n\nI think you should go and tell your sister that you support you but you do not support the wedding. You want the groom to know that you are ride or die for your sister and it just takes one text or call and you will get your sister out of there in a heartbeat.\n\nI'd also take a good look at your family dynamics and see what she's dealing with that this guy is still a catch in her eyes. The reasons the family says you are not going are off. Unsupportive I kind of get but they may be calling it unsupportive when they really mean that they want a united family front so no one knows how f'ed this marriage is going to be. Like \"bu faaaaaamily supportive\". And how would not going be selfish? Not spending the money?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're saying that you can't bring yourself to attend because you DO love her. Tell her that. \n\nTell her, gently, kindly, that you love her with your whole heart, that you always will and that you will always be here FOR HER . . . but that because you love her so very much, that you cannot in good conscience stand there and watch her marry someone who has disrespected her so deeply and fundamentally, and who you do not believe is a good or even a safe person. Tell her that you understand that she has forgiven him, and that is her choice as an adult, but you cannot forgive him; you love her too much for that, and you hope that with time she will understand.  But that this isn't about you trying to cause trouble or make her unhappy, and you're very sorry that it does. You just love her too much to be able to pretend that any of this is okay when it isn't. \n\nOf course you're NTA. I'm sorry that you're having to watch this happen with your sister. I've watched mine be in a really ugly relationship, and I know how much it hurts. Sending you lots of love and empathy.", "NTA\n\nYou _are_ being unsupportive but its because you don't support it.", "NTA.\n\nI think you should reach out to your sister and explain. It might cause a deeper rift to be honest if she buys into his BS. But its still important to try, ecspecially if you are the only one who sees it. I'd word it carefully so that she knows you support her and love her and acknowledge that shes an adult who can make her own choices. But accepting abuse to keep the peace is a pattern for people and even if she doesnt listen, maybe she'll remember your message the next time he crosses boundaries. Small things that validate she isn't crazy and can make her own choices help in the long run in abusive/manipulative relationships.", "NTA, however it could be a fun opportunity to answer the age old question \"if anyone knows any reason why this two should not be wed...\"\ud83d\ude1c", "NTA, of course you\u2019re being unsupportive. Why would anyone ever actively support that? Also you never really mentioned your relationship with your sister. Did she say anything to you about you not attending?

If you cut her off, she won't be able to go to you for help when she needs it one day. And she very likely will need it one day.", "NTA\n\nAnyhow just say you don't ahve the time or money or interest in going to CR then.", "NTA. Nope, I wouldn\u2019t support that either.", "lol great last sentence", "This.", "At first we thought the girl was 22.

Maybe you\"re a little TA for not having cut his cock, but this is your sister to do (reddit: I'm joking, violence is wong!)\n\nHowever, I would attend and convince my sister too. If this person is so manipulative and have such a grip over your sister, things could easily escalate to gaslighting her to go NC with you.\n\nAs well as I understand this is none of your business, it seems you care for your sister and so, if you care for her, the right move is to not give him a reason to manipulate her, because \"see, they didn't even attend your wedding!\" is a huge card you're putting right into his hands", "I thought this was going to be the usual petty stuff... it's not. I agree this has red flags waving all around, this guy sounds like bad news.\n\nI would encourage you to talk to your sister, tell her how much you love her and that you want the best for her but you can't bring yourself to celebrate her marrying this creep (maybe use nicer words) and although you won't be there on that day she has your full support if she needs it in the future. \n\nUgh, I'm sorry for your sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, but \u2026 I advise you reconsider. \n\nYou don\u2019t support this marriage, *nor should you*, but this person sounds like an irredeemable predatory AH. \n\nYour sister will see the light one day soon and without the right support system it\u2019ll be even harder for her to leave him. \n\nBy not attending, you\u2019re sending her the message that she\u2019s on her own now.", "NTA dude sounds gross", "I wouldn\u2019t support their wedding & your sister shouldn\u2019t go through with it either.

It\u2019s too bad she\u2019s blinded by her love for this trash of a human. The upside is- the marriage probably won\u2019t last long because she might be getting too old for him based on his previous actions, or she\u2019ll get tired of babysitting his AP baby. Definitely NOT THE ASS by not attending their \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d", "Has your sister acknowledged that she\u2019s marrying this guy despite his many, many failings or is she blaming the teenager?", "Literally made me LOL. \n\nBeat response. \n\nNTA OP.", "Exactly - right after the sister finds out he's gotten yet another extremely young woman on the hook.  This guy's not suddenly stopping that pattern...", "I honestly have no idea what has been going on in her head. I wish I did \n\nShe knows how I felt about it after the situation happened a couple years ago. But I started avoiding this conversation when it became apparent that she's trying to work things out with him, because I have nothing nice to say... I don't want her to perceive me as an unsupportive sister, even though I technically am one lol", "I think it\u2019s important not to cut ties totally in case she is one day ready to leave him, but in your position, I don\u2019t think that I could go to the wedding either. My face would give me away 100% of the time. I am more concerned that the rest of your family seems to be supporting this relationship."]}
