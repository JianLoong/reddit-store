The living room is usually the busiest space in any house.

Did your nephew even wake up?  My kiddo can sleep through anything once she is down.  \n\nYour sister sounds really stressed and maybe controlling and your mom threw your food out and that\u2019s really dismissing of your efforts and time.

My kid would wake up if I breathed too loud, I swear. But my college roommate's kids all slept through her vacuuming IN THEIR ROOMS.\n\nEventually, my daughter slept through so many noises...she takes after me and has slept through the loudest thunderstorms and other noises.\n\nSo, if your nephew is in a stage where everything wakes him, you should try to be quiet. If he wasn't waking when you were cooking, your sister overreacted. But there is little patience for sleep-deprived mothers.\n\nGL to you.

I raised three kids and these parents that require the world to stop around them are so annoying.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think it was unreasonable for you to want to cook lunch.

So your sister gets a little peace while the baby gets some sleep, but you get something nice and not punished unjustly.", "I don't think you're intentionally being a asshole, but I think you should try talking to your sister and try to understand where she's coming from. If her baby is extremely fussy or a light sleeper, then it makes sense for her to get so pissed from stress and finally get the baby to sleep. This is definitely a learning experience, if anything, and you should try to find a compromise between the two of you.", "NAH. There's a baby that finally went down for a nap. Your sister is stressed and overwhelmed and just wants the darn kid to stay asleep. You're hungry and just trying to cook food. Sometimes you're going to make noise. Sometimes the noise will wake the baby. Sometimes it won't. You're both just trying to make it through your day.
