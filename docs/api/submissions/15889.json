I am a student and she works. When I first moved in, we agreed to split rent so that I pay just a bit less than her, because she couldn't find anyone else. This was supposed to be a temporary 6-month arrangement, but after 6 months were done, she said that she would like to keep being roommates, which then turned into 4 years of this arrangement.\n\nFrom my end, I was really conscious of the inequality, and tried to equalize it by doing all the housework (which she used to use a cleaning service for), and other things such as letting her take up almost all the common storage spaces in the house. Once, when I got an internship and had to leave for 3 months, I kept paying rent because she had a health issue and I wanted to help out and she wouldn't be able to find someone else in time. Every time the lease came up for renewal, I would tell her that I will move out, but she stopped me every time, saying she doesn't mind continuing.\n\nThe past 1.5 - 2 years or so, I have been facing major issues due to her behavior. She keeps the volume on the TV really loud, or talk on the phone at all hours of the night, disturbing my sleep. There hasn't been a single week these past 6 months that I can say I slept properly, and it really affects my ability to study. I have repeatedly told her to please close the door of her bedroom or lower the volume, which she will do, but the next day she forgets again. This is among other things such as occupying the washer-dryer all the time, never putting away anything in the kitchen, blocking my doorway with her stuff etc. Basically being so inconsiderate it feels like she has actually forgotten that there is another human being living here. And I keep feeling hesitant to ask her to ask her to correct these things since she pays a bit more.\n\nWe are on a month to month lease, and out landlord suddenly announced a crazy high price increase starting the next month. I immediately told her I am going to move out and started looking. Luckily, I found something within my budget in a week. The same day I found this, my roommate told me she wanted me to stay for 2 more months since she needed that time to find someone to replace me and she offered to take on the rent increase by herself. I offered to pay the next month's higher rent even though that would lead to an overlap of rent with my new place. But I didn't want to let go of the offer that I had received, so I can't stay 2 months. Since then she has been crying, messaging and shouting at me every day and accusing me of fucking her over, and being an ungrateful bitch after all she has done for me. I'm trying my best to do her justice without having to let go of the offer for the new place that I got.

While I totally get why you would feel bad, it really isn\u2019t your responsibility to maintain your roommates finances. \n\nThe living situation you\u2019ve described is not ideal and it sounds like you\u2019ve just been living with her out of guilt. You let her know that you would be moving as soon as the rent was increased and as I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t find a place to move into the next day, she has some time to find a new roommate if she wants. It sounds like she is just trying to take advantage of how you feel indebted to her for providing you with a place to live all these years. Please know that even if you were paying less in rent you were doing her a favour. As you said in the beginning, she couldn\u2019t find anyone else and I would say you went above and beyond what a slight difference in rent would ask for. \n\nEnjoy your new apartment OP!", "NTA you have served your time.", "NTA Your roommate is. She needs to grow up. If she wants to stay in that high rent apartment let her but don't screw yourself up because of it. Continue with your plans. Go ahead and pay the next months rent since you gave her only a few weeks notice.", "Nta, her finances are not your responsibility and she's acting like a child over this. \n\nNothings forcing her to stay there either, she could find somewhere cheaper on her own if that's the issue.", "You guys came to an agreement and you even went above and beyond to make your arrangement an equal one.

Anyone renting ALWAYS needs to be considering that it may be time to look for something else and move, especially when the lease is coming due.  Move on and get on with your life.  Her problems are not your problems any longer.", "Nta but you seem like you avoid reasonable confrontations", "NTA - you\u2019ve done the right thing by communicating your intentions in advance and making sure she\u2019s not out of pocket. 1 month is plenty of time to find a new roommate.", "NTA...
