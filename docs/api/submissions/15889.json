I am a student and she works. When I first moved in, we agreed to split rent so that I pay just a bit less than her, because she couldn't find anyone else. This was supposed to be a temporary 6-month arrangement, but after 6 months were done, she said that she would like to keep being roommates, which then turned into 4 years of this arrangement.\n\nFrom my end, I was really conscious of the inequality, and tried to equalize it by doing all the housework (which she used to use a cleaning service for), and other things such as letting her take up almost all the common storage spaces in the house. Once, when I got an internship and had to leave for 3 months, I kept paying rent because she had a health issue and I wanted to help out and she wouldn't be able to find someone else in time. Every time the lease came up for renewal, I would tell her that I will move out, but she stopped me every time, saying she doesn't mind continuing.\n\nThe past 1.5 - 2 years or so, I have been facing major issues due to her behavior. She keeps the volume on the TV really loud, or talk on the phone at all hours of the night, disturbing my sleep. There hasn't been a single week these past 6 months that I can say I slept properly, and it really affects my ability to study. I have repeatedly told her to please close the door of her bedroom or lower the volume, which she will do, but the next day she forgets again. This is among other things such as occupying the washer-dryer all the time, never putting away anything in the kitchen, blocking my doorway with her stuff etc. Basically being so inconsiderate it feels like she has actually forgotten that there is another human being living here. And I keep feeling hesitant to ask her to ask her to correct these things since she pays a bit more.\n\nWe are on a month to month lease, and out landlord suddenly announced a crazy high price increase starting the next month. I immediately told her I am going to move out and started looking. Luckily, I found something within my budget in a week. The same day I found this, my roommate told me she wanted me to stay for 2 more months since she needed that time to find someone to replace me and she offered to take on the rent increase by herself. I offered to pay the next month's higher rent even though that would lead to an overlap of rent with my new place. But I didn't want to let go of the offer that I had received, so I can't stay 2 months. Since then she has been crying, messaging and shouting at me every day and accusing me of fucking her over, and being an ungrateful bitch after all she has done for me. I'm trying my best to do her justice without having to let go of the offer for the new place that I got.

While I totally get why you would feel bad, it really isn\u2019t your responsibility to maintain your roommates finances. \n\nThe living situation you\u2019ve described is not ideal and it sounds like you\u2019ve just been living with her out of guilt. You let her know that you would be moving as soon as the rent was increased and as I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t find a place to move into the next day, she has some time to find a new roommate if she wants. It sounds like she is just trying to take advantage of how you feel indebted to her for providing you with a place to live all these years. Please know that even if you were paying less in rent you were doing her a favour.

You offered to stay an extra month.  That's the extent of your obligation.", "Exactly this. If she can\u2019t afford it she can leave too.", "NTA\n\nI'm curious to know just how much less rent you were paying because I suspect it wasn't that much less that you needed to relegate yourself to 2nd class citizen in your own home. Sounds more like you were subsidizing her life and she's mad she's losing a live-in housekeeper - one who paid for the privilege of working for her!\n\nI mean, what \"she did for you?\" What was that really?", "NTA. It sounds like she maybe enjoyed paying more just to have a sense of control, and now she's losing it.", "NTA... go... there is no need to feel guilt. There is promice broken", "NTA,", "NTA. You've spent four years living in a situation that makes you feel like you have to make sacrifices just to exist in thanks for a discount on rent. Get out of there. Especially now that she's thrown it in your face. I'd also like to point out that it seems like you're the one who's been doing her a favor, not the other way around.", "NTA. You are not responsible for her financial condition even if she was a good roommate. Live your life.", "NTA She seems to have forgotten you were roomates, there is no obligation for *anyone* to stay for any amount of time other than what the rental agreement states.", "NTA.\n\n\nOn the contrary, ex-roommate seems like one. \n\nYou seem to have gone out of your way for her on multiple occasions... You may have not been paying rent 50/50 but you were thoughtful and tried to balance it out in other ways so it'd be more fair for her, etc.\nHer not managing her finances properly shouldn't be your responsibility/concern in any way, nor you should feel any guilt. You already had to deal with it for 4 years.\n\n\nGlad you got out of there\ud83e\udd27\n(Side note: maybe instead of yelling at you etc, ex-roomie could put all that energy into figuring out what to do w the situation she put herself into)", "Nta\n\nDo you ever wonder if she has a hard time finding people live with her because no one want to deal with her bullshit?", "I would also add that OP more than adequately compensated for the financial difference so there is nothing to hang over her head.

You're going to need it anyway.", "NTA, I think you've gone above what you ought to do as a roommate\n\nBest to leave now b/c you been so accommodating over the years that your roommate is used to taking you for granted, e.g., you doing all the housework, hogging the washer/dryer, blocking your room door, being loud at all hours.  \n\n\nI get that you felt you owed something because of the rent difference, but your roommate agreed to it and was obviously keen enough to keep you that they kept extending it.  \n\n\nAlso: based on how you described your roommate's behavior, there may be a reason they weren't able to find a roommate when you moved in...", "This, OP! \u2b06\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f", "Just leave....stop being emotionally manipulative.

Move, but make sure you give her a written notice, also one to landlord, if you are on the lease.  Keep a copy, you may need this. You are being emotionally blackmailed into staying.  You need to stay firm and go.  Good luck.", "NTA very clearly. You were really considerate all the time even and offered to also pay for one extra month you didn't have to do.", "NTA\n\nLiterally what you did is normal roommate stuff. So you paid a bit less? But she had more use of the common area? Normal. You want to leave for WHATEVER reason, even without just the price increase? Normal. Paying the overlap in rent is normal too at least up to 30 days after you give notice you're moving in a roommate situation to give a reasonable amount of time to find a new roommate. The roommate is the one being extreme and you have done nothing here that is weird.", "NTA - That was an awful lot of text to ask if you're an asshole for wanting to move out.", "NTA", "Even if you're month to month, two months notice is the standard", "NTA. You\u2019ve lived there long enough and have been generous in offering to pay the next month\u2019s higher rent. She\u2019s the AH for trying to force you to stay.

You are her roommate and her financial issues are not your responsibility.", "Nta, she is taking advantage of you", "NTA", "nta", "NTA- If someone kept me up all night, specially after telling them to keep it down, I would loose my shit every time they did it.

She had as much notice as you did.  Plus, you've put up with behavior that not many would.  Move on, and don't feel any guilt about it.  You might need to go no contact as soon as you can get out the door, though, or she will keep piling guilt on you.", "It\u2019s tough but you aren\u2019t responsible for her problems. She isn\u2019t responsible for yours. NTA.", "Run far, run fast. This is emotionally abusive behavior, your roommate has zero respect for you. You made a right choise to move out and I believe your behavior about rent, housework and everything else you've done for her far surpasses anything she's done for you (which I believe starts and ends with paying little higher rent). I hope you will be happy in your new apartment :)\nOh and obviously you are definetly NTA. She hovewer kinda is.", "NTA for moving out. However you need to reflect on why you are letting someone treat you like shit for so long and not standing up for yourself and your needs."]}
