It was a surprise, so I left everything to him.\n\nA month before the trip, he informed me that his parents (5x/F, M) would be tagging along. This was unexpected to me. I was uncomfortable but the booking had already been made. I probably asked if we were sleeping in separate rooms, and he replied no due to financial constraints (fair), but I later forgot that I asked. He did assure me that his parents would have separate activities and we would have alone time. \n\nThe trip came around - a three-day, two-night trip. \n\nDay 1. While in transit I asked why the arrangement. He disclosed to me that his mother had made a big fuss when she found out about this trip (he had been travelling with me a lot, and she was upset that he hadn\u2019t been making time for his parents). On the basis that her birthday falls on the same week as mine (surprise), she insisted on joining the trip. So how could her only son say no? \n\nI did not take this new information well emotionally, especially because I don\u2019t like his mother to begin with. Also the fact that this was straight-up an emotionally manipulative move.\n\nWe check into accommodations and I realise we\u2019re sharing one room. We have no privacy. We have virtually no alone time together on the first day. I sleep conflicted. \n\nDay 2 was where it went to hell. I woke up on the wrong side of the bed and with a flu. I was mentally spiralling, thinking how dare his mother impinge on a trip FOR ME like this.\n\nI was this close to crying and I couldn\u2019t even tell my boyfriend OR cry. Naturally I had zero interest in entertaining his parents. Later I was told that I was frowning the entire day, unreceptive, disengaged, and when his mother spoke to me I replied her brusquely and avoided eye contact. I avoided conversations and slept whenever I could in the car. \n\nDay 3 and until now. The trip ended and I felt more liberated than anything else. A few days later my boyfriend informs me that his mother was very offended by my actions on Day 2 and she thinks I\u2019m a brat who can\u2019t respect her elders. She doesn\u2019t want to see me for the time being. Oh no, I think. How tragic. God, how little I care. \n\nTo be fair, his parents had done nothing to offend me during the trip. They did not impose on me any expectations, or rules, and I would even say that his mother was accommodating and kind to me throughout. That\u2019s the one thing that makes me feel mildly bad. But imo they should never have made what was my birthday trip into a family trip. I regret acting so childishly and perhaps I should have dealt with it better, but I am not apologetic for my feelings. Maybe she didn\u2019t deserve it, but she shouldn\u2019t have come. And maybe my behaviour during the trip was because I wanted to punish everyone, scorched-earth style. \n\nCurious - AITA?", "created_utc": 1671664650, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zs4u77/aita_for_sulking_during_my_birthday_trip_that_my/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not a cultural difference, it's a power imbalance. \n\nFirst, he offers a generous romantic surprise for your birthday - an overseas trip, all expenses paid. Of course you are appreciative and want to go, because your assumption is that this will be a time to build memories as a couple. \n\nThen he says his parents are coming. This completely changes the original dynamic. It's not a trip for the two of you, it's a family trip where you have to tag along. You don't even book separate rooms, so the four of you are sharing a room? That is a reasonable point to bow out of the trip. This isn't about his family insisting on doing a day trip that didn't particularly interest you, it completely changed what the trip was to be about. It completely disrespected your private time with your boyfriend. \n\nYou could have bowed out of the trip, at no cost to him because he was still only booking one room, OR you could have offered to pay for a second hotel room. You went with Option 3, go along and sulk, instead of being proactive and take control of the situation. \n\nSulking is not going to make your boyfriend sit up and realize he's disrespecting you. It gave him more power over you, to drive home that you needed to be \"grateful\" for his generosity. You can say No, thank you, to a gift.
