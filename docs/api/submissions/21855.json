Why do you need his permission to seek medical care? Why is he \"allowing\" you to rest? Why are you with a person who has so little care for your health? This isn't about a possible concussion (which is a serious issue by itself ) but about this man is controlling you so much. The silent treatment because of anger over you wanting medical attention is screaming control and abuse. You might want to discuss that with medical staff when you go. Give this some serious thought.", "NTA: this is a form of abuse, just because he doesn\u2019t care for his health doesn\u2019t mean he should deny you your basic rights to medical care. \n\nMy great grandma when she was a kid, hit her head while falling off a deck. Nobody thought anything about it, she was look at by doctors. Years later and I mean many years later, she has a seizure in her sleep and smothered herself in her pillow. Doctors told my great grandpa that it probably was caused by the accident from her childhood.\n\nMy grandpa has a coworker who literally had skin c a n c e r on his shoulder and wouldn\u2019t do anything about it until he was like look how bad it got and my grandpa literally told him hey it\u2019s gonna keep getting worse to the point he was either gonna lose his shoulder or pass a way. So he went to the doctor to prove my grandpa wrong and the doctor was like you should\u2019ve came a lot sooner. He has a very aggressive form of skin c a n c e r. \n\nSo yeah you should get looked at. You never know if you had any underlying issues. You should care about yourself. It sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t care about himself or you.", "\"AITA for making a big deal out of what might be a non-issue and immediately defaulting to going behind his back?\"\n\nNTA. You have serious health issues which he dismisses out of hand. It might be a non-issue, it might be serious, hence going to the doctor. They tend to take hitting your head pretty seriously. Better safe than sorry.\n\nIt is his behaviour and refusal to take you seriously that makes you default to going behind his back.\n\nThat is on him, not you. And the silent treatment? So childish.", "NTA.\n\nWhat fucking controlling weirdo.\n\nI think he's just afraid of doctors.", "NTA\n\nGo to the hospital. This is what they are there for.\n\nConcussions are not a joke. There could also be a lot worse things happening beneath the skull.", "As others have mentioned this is definitely a form of abuse. Psychological to be exact. Marginalization of medical issues and ignoring medical anxiety is just another form of abuse that manifests itself in relationships where a partner has checked out and doesn\u2019t see their partner as needing to be cared for. It\u2019s a \u2018you\u2019ll be fine\u2019 and \u2018no need to exaggerate\u2019 mindset and it\u2019s based in neglect and lack of empathy. I can\u2019t tell you how it starts. But it definitely leads to feelings of resentment and larger problems in most relationships long term.", "You know medical abuse is a thing right? Regardless of this specific situation your husband is abusive and the silent treatment is a nice touch of emotional abuse on this sh*t Sandwich of a marriage. I know saying leave is always easier said than done and can be dangerous but please try and find a safety exit plan. This is not okay. Obviously NTA", "NTA.  It's your health that is being discussed.  Your husband doesn't want to take your concerns seriously.", "NTA. \n\nNot caring about his own health is one thing. \n\nGetting angry at you for caring about your health is fucking weird.", "Most definitely NTA but your husband is and he\u2019s throwing red flags out!! Medical abuse is a real thing. The silent treatment is emotional abuse. Please get yourself to the hospital and get evaluated even if you do need to ask his sister. I also think you need to serious think about your husband\u2019s behavior here.", "NTA. Is this the same abusive husband you were trying to divorce three years ago? Regardless, you\u2019re husband is trying to exert his will over yours.

OP, your husband has issues that could be dangerous for you. MY BIL bumped his head getting into a car.
