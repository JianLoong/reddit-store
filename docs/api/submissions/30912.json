We immediately started saving to go see her, she lives 11 hours away in new york.\n\nNow, im disabled. It didnt happen all at once, but ive been diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, narcolepsy, ptsd and a few other disorders. This basically means it hurts to be bumped, grabbed, touched, ect, and that i need to sit down sometimes. My physical illnesses can also be made worse if my mental illnesses are triggered. I utilize a service dog, a cane, wheelchair, or walker. My service dog is almost always with me, i rotate the mobility aids for how im feeling. Some days i am fine without the mobility aid.\n\nProblems arose recently when i talked about bringing my walker and cane with me. My service dog is already being left behind, as i was told the grandmother didnt like animals in her home. My husband talked about going on a 3 hour long tour for ground zero. I responded along the lines of \"sounds awesome, i need to make sure i bring my walker for that\" and after that it feels like he completely shut down.\nHe told me that his family doesn't believe in invisible illnesses. His mom is also disabled and was basically ridiculed for using medical devices as well. He hinted at wanting me to go without, by telling me thats what his mom did. I told him in short, i am not compromising myself further and risking a flare up to appease his family.\n\nNow, technically i *can* go without any aid, but i know my body and i would definitely send myself into a flare up. Ill be on high alert and more painful for the whole trip. I can manage for a short while, with my aids.\nBut with nothing, its a recipe for disaster. The last flare up i had (about 2 weeks ago) left me bedbound for 2 days, and unable to even go to the bathroom on my own. I also had an unexplained day long fever of 103. I would need to be hospitalized. I asked him how his family would deal with a flare up while i was up there, then, and got no reply. He told me we just shouldnt go. I asked him to at least talk to his family, but kept getting that same response.\n\nI sent him a text overnight telling him that he can go without me, but that i again, wont be making myself uncomfortable because his family is ableist. I also learned at some point a niece might be bringing her dog to their gmas house, so that hurt.\n\nIm at a loss. Part of me feels overdramatic and that i should just deal, because this would be the last time hed be able to see his gma. But then part of me also feels unsupported, as hes been on this whole medical journey with me; hes seen my flare ups. Why set me up for failure.\nAITA for standing my ground on this?", "created_utc": 1699893431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uemdm/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_long_roadtrip/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to defend you.\n\nNta", "\"I sent him a text overnight telling him that he can go without me\"\n\nThis is the only right answer for you.  That family is  the poster child for ableism.

If he is not willing to accept you as you are, the fact that you need medical devices, and refuses to grow a spine to make sure his family respects and understands you, it might be time to reconsider your relationship as a whole. You are disabled, you will be the rest of your life, what happens if your mobility declines further? Is he just going to abandon you at home and live his life without you? Will he assist you as needed? Is he going to expect you to fake normality at the detriment of your own health any time there's a visit with his family involved? You're already being made to leave your service dog behind because his grandmother doesn't like animals. Guess what, she's dying, she doesn't get to dictate whether or not you continue to live in the way that  best allows you to function independently.

Think about it, he literally asked you to put your own health at risk just so he could avoid having to confront his family\u2019s ableism. What kind of husband would do that to someone they supposedly love?! Has he asked you to leave necessary medical equipment at home in the past? If so, what exactly was his reasoning for doing so?

It\u2019s rough having chronic condition and it being invisible.

You get to decide what mobility aids to use and when- your husband\u2019s family does not get to dictate how you use these extensions of your physical body. \n\nFrankly, your husband is TA here for not backing you up & supporting you, he sounds like he\u2019s being very inconsiderate on SO many levels.
