We immediately started saving to go see her, she lives 11 hours away in new york.\n\nNow, im disabled. It didnt happen all at once, but ive been diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, narcolepsy, ptsd and a few other disorders. This basically means it hurts to be bumped, grabbed, touched, ect, and that i need to sit down sometimes. My physical illnesses can also be made worse if my mental illnesses are triggered. I utilize a service dog, a cane, wheelchair, or walker. My service dog is almost always with me, i rotate the mobility aids for how im feeling. Some days i am fine without the mobility aid.\n\nProblems arose recently when i talked about bringing my walker and cane with me. My service dog is already being left behind, as i was told the grandmother didnt like animals in her home. My husband talked about going on a 3 hour long tour for ground zero. I responded along the lines of \"sounds awesome, i need to make sure i bring my walker for that\" and after that it feels like he completely shut down.\nHe told me that his family doesn't believe in invisible illnesses. His mom is also disabled and was basically ridiculed for using medical devices as well. He hinted at wanting me to go without, by telling me thats what his mom did. I told him in short, i am not compromising myself further and risking a flare up to appease his family.\n\nNow, technically i *can* go without any aid, but i know my body and i would definitely send myself into a flare up. Ill be on high alert and more painful for the whole trip. I can manage for a short while, with my aids.\nBut with nothing, its a recipe for disaster. The last flare up i had (about 2 weeks ago) left me bedbound for 2 days, and unable to even go to the bathroom on my own. I also had an unexplained day long fever of 103. I would need to be hospitalized. I asked him how his family would deal with a flare up while i was up there, then, and got no reply. He told me we just shouldnt go. I asked him to at least talk to his family, but kept getting that same response.\n\nI sent him a text overnight telling him that he can go without me, but that i again, wont be making myself uncomfortable because his family is ableist. I also learned at some point a niece might be bringing her dog to their gmas house, so that hurt.\n\nIm at a loss. Part of me feels overdramatic and that i should just deal, because this would be the last time hed be able to see his gma. But then part of me also feels unsupported, as hes been on this whole medical journey with me; hes seen my flare ups. Why set me up for failure.\nAITA for standing my ground on this?", "created_utc": 1699893431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uemdm/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_long_roadtrip/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m curious to know how his family truly feels about your illness , it might be just him as far as we know.", "NTA. Take them all and stay in a hotel if the grandmother doesn't want a dog staying there. Your husband, OTOH, is an asshole for not backing you up.\n\nAlso look into a mobility scooter. We bought one for my wife that weighs 35 pounds, folds small, holds 350 pounds, and has a fairly long battery life. Even I use it sometimes!", ">I sent him a text overnight telling him that he can go without me\n\nNTA on the issue of the trip, obviously. \n\nBut why are you *texting* this to your husband?  Does he not live with you?  Surely this is the kind of thing that spouses should be able to discuss face-to-face.", "Your husband is the AH . There is no reason you should go without your aids,  it's irrelevant what his family thinks. Why does your husband make such a thing of this? He needs to defend you.\n\nNta", "\"I sent him a text overnight telling him that he can go without me\"\n\nThis is the only right answer for you.  That family is  the poster child for ableism.  I mean, who doesn't allow an actual working service dog in their home?  And a 3 hour walking tour with your conditions and no walker?  That is not a reasonable ask.  NTA to stay home.\n\nYour husband is a shitty partner.", "NTA. This is literally a part of who you are. If he can't support you, y'all need to see a therapist or something. This isn't a situation that's going to get better through the power of denial or something", "NTA. Whether his family \"believes\" in invisible illnesses doesn't matter. If you use and need the mobility aids, you use and need them.", "NTA. He can go without you.", "NTA.\n\nBut he doesn't want you to go with him.", "NTA. Its totally reasonable for you to want to take your medical aids with you. You even suggested he go without you as a compromise which I think is also very reasonable. He needs to grow a spine and stand up to his family.", "NTA\n\nNo service dog, no mobility aids, no trip. \n\nThat's on him and his family. They are the AH, especially if a pet dog is going to be there. \n\nEnjoy your staycation and have a mini \"just for me\" weekend.", "NTA.\n\nBut also if you disabilities mean you need mobility aids that is not invisible.  They may not accept the diagnoses but that's is some major BS.  His he is being ableist too.  You cannot be without your accommodations, that is ridiculous to an extreme degree. \n\nHe and his family sound like absolute assholes.  \n\nI hate ableism.", "NTA. Your husband is supposed to support you and have your back. Not be worried about what his relatives think. Take this trip as a sign of how your husband really feels about you and how far he\u2019d go for you.", "NTA\n\nYou should not have to put your physical and mental health at risk because your husband's family are bullies.\n\nI would be asking husband why he isn't advocating for you and standing up to his abusive family", "NTA, mobility aids give you the ability to protect and empower yourself, and if your husband can't stand up to his ableist garbage family, perhaps it's time you two discuss couples counseling and reasonable expectations of support. If he is not willing to accept you as you are, the fact that you need medical devices, and refuses to grow a spine to make sure his family respects and understands you, it might be time to reconsider your relationship as a whole. You are disabled, you will be the rest of your life, what happens if your mobility declines further? Is he just going to abandon you at home and live his life without you? Will he assist you as needed? Is he going to expect you to fake normality at the detriment of your own health any time there's a visit with his family involved? You're already being made to leave your service dog behind because his grandmother doesn't like animals. Guess what, she's dying, she doesn't get to dictate whether or not you continue to live in the way that  best allows you to function independently. Marriage is in sickness and in health, and honestly your husband and his family sound like the type to cut and run when presented with disability. Do **NOT** let these people impact your quality of life over their ignorance.", "NTA you are NEVER an AH for looking out for your own safety. How dare your husband tell you to go without your necessary medical equipment! And yes, if you PHYSICALLY need a piece of equipment to be able to even move around, then it is indeed necessary medical equipment! Tbh the fact that he even asked you to do this would have me reconsidering the relationship. Think about it, he literally asked you to put your own health at risk just so he could avoid having to confront his family\u2019s ableism. What kind of husband would do that to someone they supposedly love?! Has he asked you to leave necessary medical equipment at home in the past? If so, what exactly was his reasoning for doing so? Me thinks your husband\u2019s family might not be the ONLY ableists here, and you\u2019ve got some hard and serious questions you need to ask yourself.", "NTA but seems like something you may want to stay home for unless you also have a relationship with his grandma and want to see her before she dies. Not sure why your husband is deciding not to support you and stand up for you to his family though, which seems like a bigger deal.", "NTA. I wouldn't go.", "NTA\n\nIf you need mobility aids, then take them. What do they know about your needs that you don\u2019t? Don\u2019t they want to be seen with disabled people?\n\nIt comes down to one thing - are you going to pander to the bizarre whims of ignorant AHs. Your choice.", "NTA. Your husband should be advocating for his wife, his partner. Not rolling over and showing belly to his discriminating family and forcing you to text him about it instead of speaking face to face. His refusal to stand up for you and your needs speaks volumes.\n\nYou're only 25. Is this what you want the rest of your life to look like?", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry you have a husband that doesn\u2019t stand up for what you know your body needs. \n\nEnjoy your stress free time with your dog while he\u2019s gone, your mental and physical health will thank you.", "Definitely NTA, and I will say it\u2019s probably better for you to simply not go, and for your husband to go alone. If the family is so ableist then they are likely to react badly if your conditions flare while you are out for a visit, especially if they think you are trying to steal your husband\u2019s attention from them.  \n\nSending a virtual hug your way. It\u2019s rough having chronic condition and it being invisible.  Having to \u201cprove\u201d you are sick and in pain frequently is it\u2019s own special sort of hell. as for the rheumatoid arthritis, unfortunately we have the Black Death to blame for causing people with over active immune systems to be the survivors. And I say \u201cwe\u201d because it runs deep in my family too.", "Sorry, I didn't read it until the end and already have a question for you. Why are you with this selfish and spineless man?", "NTA. You get to decide what mobility aids to use and when- your husband\u2019s family does not get to dictate how you use these extensions of your physical body. \n\nFrankly, your husband is TA here for not backing you up & supporting you, he sounds like he\u2019s being very inconsiderate on SO many levels. So ableist and rude. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to cave to your husband\u2019s and his family\u2019s ableism.", "NTA.\n\nDo you need to chop your leg off for his parents to \u201cbelieve\u201d you\u2019re disabled? He\u2019s the AH and so is his family. \n\nI hope you find someone that supports you and any \nlimitations you face. What you\u2019re dealing with is REAL whether anybody can see it or not.", "The grandmother is about to die any minute. The trip is about her not you.

Probably every time he spoke up as a child got smacked, yelled at, or bullied by the women in the family and the dad didn\u2019t do crap.  I mainly say this because as soon as you spoke up he immediately shut down.
