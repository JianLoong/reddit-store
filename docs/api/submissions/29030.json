Sorry for grammatical errors. \r  \n\r  \nI (27f) was an only child of my mom for 16 yrs. Mom(45f) and I did not live together as I live in our home country and she worked abroad up to my 15 yrs. She met my stepdad(55m) when I was 13. They got married where he lives (in Europe). I come from Asia. When mom got pregnant they were so happy as they were not expecting to have another child since I'm all grown up. I got a sister.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward when I was 22 they wanted a 2nd baby. But my mom has high blood pressure so getting pregnant is very risky. But they pushed it through IVF. Apparently they wanted to try for a boy. Since they have 2 daughters now. \r  \n\r  \nI still live at home since the housing market from where I live is too expensive. I also redo highschool when I came here and I still want to go to college so I'm currently working. I offered to pay rent and necessities but my parents declined as they wanted me to save up for college. \r  \n\r  \nBut instead they want me to help with household chores.  Mind you, both of them work 6 days. Sometimes, 7 days. They have their own business aside from working full time jobs. With that, I became the parent of my 2 younger sibs. \r  \n\r  \nIt was hard to balance everything. My work, maintaining the household, my social life and my boyfriend. I feel like I'm parenting. I\u2019m struggling with my low iron and very little energy with my not so great mental health issues. I love my parents to the bone but I'm honestly so tired. \r  \n\r  \nMy last straw was when I planned something with a friend and asked them 3 months before the plan to find a babysitter because I want to go to a concert. The day of the concert came, no babysitter in sight. I was panicking already since my train time is nearing and I'm stuck with my 5 and 10 yr old sibs. So I started tearing up and couldn't contact them. Luckily my bf is free (he lives an hour away from where i live) he offered to bring me to the concert place upon learning the situation and I brought my sisters to my aunt who lives 5 min by car.\r  \n\r  \nLater I found out that my aunt is supposed to be the babysitter and she can't pick up my sisters since she\u2019s not feeling well and asked my parents to bring them instead to her but they happened to \u201cforgot\u201d telling me. But this is the 5th time of the month they\u2019ve casually forgotten to tell me. I feel like they are disrespecting my time.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so I confronted my parents, and this is where I might be the AH cause after confronting them, I also told them I would not babysit the children I didn't give birth to anymore and that it's their children, not mine. So they told me I'm ungrateful and some names. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m actually having doubts whether I should apologize or not as I feel like it\u2019s wrong to say what I said but they weren\u2019t exactly right either. Idk y\u2019all. It\u2019s my first time saying something mean. You could say I finally exploded. I\u2019m currently staying with a friend.

If you have a child, that child is your responsibility and your responsibility alone. If you are not willing to give up work or pay for childcare then you should not have a kid.

I've discussed moving out many times but they told me that it's better to live at home till i have enough savings as living with them is also cheaper.

I got paid \u00a3550 a week. the lodging and food were not sufficient payment, I was also entitled to literal payment.\n\nWere you not there, your parents would have to employ someone to take your place, or significantly change their lifestyles to care for the kids themselves.

Your mum and stepdad have gotten too comfortable with having a live-in nanny. I don't think they will ever be okay with you moving out coz that will mean them actually parenting their own kids.\n\nYour mum was in a whole other country until you became a teenager and had someone else parent you. Now she's again having someone else (you) parent her two other children. Who's to say she won't keep you around until your sibs become teenagers too? How much of your life are you willing to sacrifice?\n\nYou have fire now. Move out before they put it out. Don't tell them. Don't have any more discussions. Find a place. Move all your stuff (especially all your important documents). After your stuff is safely out of your mother's house and into your new place, then and only then, do you tell them that you've moved. Don't even tell your siblings incase they tell your parents.\n\nEdited."]}
