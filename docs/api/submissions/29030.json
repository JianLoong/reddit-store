Sorry for grammatical errors. \r  \n\r  \nI (27f) was an only child of my mom for 16 yrs. Mom(45f) and I did not live together as I live in our home country and she worked abroad up to my 15 yrs. She met my stepdad(55m) when I was 13. They got married where he lives (in Europe). I come from Asia. When mom got pregnant they were so happy as they were not expecting to have another child since I'm all grown up. I got a sister.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward when I was 22 they wanted a 2nd baby. But my mom has high blood pressure so getting pregnant is very risky. But they pushed it through IVF. Apparently they wanted to try for a boy. Since they have 2 daughters now. \r  \n\r  \nI still live at home since the housing market from where I live is too expensive. I also redo highschool when I came here and I still want to go to college so I'm currently working. I offered to pay rent and necessities but my parents declined as they wanted me to save up for college. \r  \n\r  \nBut instead they want me to help with household chores.  Mind you, both of them work 6 days. Sometimes, 7 days. They have their own business aside from working full time jobs. With that, I became the parent of my 2 younger sibs. \r  \n\r  \nIt was hard to balance everything. My work, maintaining the household, my social life and my boyfriend. I feel like I'm parenting. I\u2019m struggling with my low iron and very little energy with my not so great mental health issues. I love my parents to the bone but I'm honestly so tired. \r  \n\r  \nMy last straw was when I planned something with a friend and asked them 3 months before the plan to find a babysitter because I want to go to a concert. The day of the concert came, no babysitter in sight. I was panicking already since my train time is nearing and I'm stuck with my 5 and 10 yr old sibs. So I started tearing up and couldn't contact them. Luckily my bf is free (he lives an hour away from where i live) he offered to bring me to the concert place upon learning the situation and I brought my sisters to my aunt who lives 5 min by car.\r  \n\r  \nLater I found out that my aunt is supposed to be the babysitter and she can't pick up my sisters since she\u2019s not feeling well and asked my parents to bring them instead to her but they happened to \u201cforgot\u201d telling me. But this is the 5th time of the month they\u2019ve casually forgotten to tell me. I feel like they are disrespecting my time.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so I confronted my parents, and this is where I might be the AH cause after confronting them, I also told them I would not babysit the children I didn't give birth to anymore and that it's their children, not mine. So they told me I'm ungrateful and some names. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m actually having doubts whether I should apologize or not as I feel like it\u2019s wrong to say what I said but they weren\u2019t exactly right either. Idk y\u2019all. It\u2019s my first time saying something mean. You could say I finally exploded. I\u2019m currently staying with a friend.
