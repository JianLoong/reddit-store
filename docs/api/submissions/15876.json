I realised that I would lose nothing by helping Jane and it would be more of an investment than anything. I also realise that I got too stuck on the principle of the matter and whether or not Jane's intentions were purely for the relationship when in reality I wasn't really a person who was yearning for that  relationship which something that lot of people in the comments noticed.\n\n 2 days later I called Jane and asked to meet at noon. She said yes. When we meet I put it to her straight. I told her I would pay for only if her grades would improve. I don't expect her to be top of the the class but they should be be on an upwards trajectory. The next thing I told her was that she has the choice to have a relationship or not. I told her that I was helping her so that she would have the best chance to succeed in life and so that she would not blame me if she ever failed in life. It ultimately doesn't change much in my life if I do or don't have the relationship. She didn't say if she did or didn't want to have a relationship. \n\nSo I feel quite satisfied and happy with the outcome of the situation. I think it's a win-win on both side. Thank you for the advice.", "created_utc": 1682664027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131jw1j/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_pay_my_childs/", "score": 1309, "replies": ["Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pt41k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_pay_for_my_childs/)"]}
