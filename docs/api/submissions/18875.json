Heaven,  Hell, Adam,  Eve  Noah all of it. That said, while you shouldn't  have  laughed, you are correct.  My family  has discussions  of  this nature  often.  You can certainly  give foolishly to mega churches  in exchange  for  promised miracles.  It is a terrible  thing.  Christ never charged  for a single  miracle  he performed and the one person  who even suggested  that  the  power  of  the Holy Spirit  was for sale  got in HUGE trouble  and begged for prayer. She should  have  paid  her  debts  and  taken  care  of  her  home. Tithes and offerings  keep the light of the building  we worship  in on.  If she wants  to  thank God, he is quite  fine with  her  prayers and praises but she didn't  do anything  wrong for that to happen.

It\u2019s better to just smile and nod at this sort of thing. By all means tell the truth if they ask for your opinion, but there\u2019s no need to offer it unprompted. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to change their mind or anything.", "The real predator is the church. Donating to it doesn\u2019t do anything but wasted money. \n\nAlthough a bit of YTA for laughing and making fun of her. Plenty of ways to tell her she should do other things with her money than laughing in her face. That\u2019s just rude.", "I'm going to say NAH because what she said  does seem out there. I've laughed in situations like those before I've realized that the person was dead serious. However, I've also grown up in/adjacent to churches that preach/believe similar to the comment your mother made. Your mom was upset because she's been manipulated, intentionally or unintentionally, that anything bad that happens is due to a lack of faith or sinning and that through more faith (in this case faith is represented by how much money she donates) she can \"get back into God's good graces.\" She feels like everything bad that's been happening is her fault because she did something wrong and now she's excited because she's been led to believe that giving that much money is to correct her \"sin(s)\"\n\nWhat happened at that dinner, and what was said is indicative of a deeper problem. Again, she is likely being manipulated, and this could lead to more financial troubles. Please keep an eye on your mother for more signs that her friends/pastor/congregation isn't trying to get more money out of her.", "YTA. \n\nLook, if you wrote the exact same post saying you only brought up her financial difficulties and questioning the wisdom of her donation I\u2019d be on your side. However, you laughing in her face is more mockery than anything else. Her donation isn\u2019t funny, it\u2019s sad.

If you have sincere concern over her finances, that topic should be discussed without scorn and judgement.", "tbh ESH. She was really silly for donating so much when she really needs the money but you were a bit of an AH for laughing at her beliefs and your dad is also wrong for going along with this nonsense", "YTA but she deserves your derision.", "She can do what she wants with her money, it's not your place to police how she uses it. Yea, 5k is an excessive amount but honestly, it's not your money.", "How much payout did she get?", "NTA - any church that cared about it\u2019s members would turn down such an obviously irresponsible donation.

And people who are not used to getting large lumps of money at once. Tend to make bad choices sometimes thinking the money will last forever. It doesn't and she will learn when the Church doesn't exactly help her back in time.  God is neutral usually.", "ESH. What did you think that would accomplish?\n\nIt sounds like your mother might be religiously abused. Your reaction was absolutely inappropriate, and unhelpful.", "ESH. Yeah, giving away $5k was kind of a dumb, emotional thing to do. But it's very common to react to life-threatening events in dumb, emotional ways. It would be better to have some compassion, warn her about making rash decisions while she's still shaken from the accident, and help her find better ways to cope.", "Awww I love that your mom has such an admirable faith - God doesn\u2019t punish people like that though.

Honestly, that a church would take such a sum from a person with $ difficulties speaks volumes about both the church, and the donor.", "NTA at all! Religion has brainwashed people into voluntarily giving their money to the church to, \"avoid damnnation\". It's a scam, there has never been any proof that anything in the Bible, or for that matter, ANY biblical publication has any basis in fact.

Then he would boast from the pulpit about how many horses his wife and daughters kept as pets, and about their family vacation snorkeling in the Bahamas.

We had a member of my church when I was a kid donate a car because the Pastor\u2019s car broke down. Anyone with logic and reason as their ally would have laughed at what your mom did.

Man is impelled to invent theories to account for what happens in the world. Unfortunately, he is not quite intelligent enough, in most cases, to find correct explanations. So that when he acts on his theories, he behaves very often like a lunatic. Thus, no animal is clever enough, when there is a drought, to imagine that the rain is being withheld by evil spirits, or as punishment for its transgressions. Therefore you never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. No horse, for example would kill one of its foals to make the wind change direction. Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, intelligent enough.\"\nAldous Huxley\n\nNote: there's implicit sex bias here that we no longer use.", "My mom throws away $30 a week giving it to a church.

Then she spent a small fortune on a Mary Kay \u201cbusiness\u201d and ran my father\u2019s actual business into the ground.   They went bankrupt and lost the house.
