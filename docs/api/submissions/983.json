The amount varies, if it's family / close friends we tend to go with 70 for me and my partner, if it's just a friend 50. We've received between 10 and 500 for our own wedding depending on the person and if they were invited for the party or only the ceremony. On average it's maybe \u20ac25 a head.\n\nWedding registries also exist, but have fallen out of custom/fashion, and were mostly to make sure the newlyweds had cuttlery and basic furniture to start living together.\n\nRegular gifts like you had planned are also accepted.", "NTA. Heh, she's gonna end up with 6 people at her wedding", "NTA, I\u2019ve been to a wedding where guests were giving envelopes of money to the couple but no one was forced to put inside a minimum amount, that\u2019s just tacky and dishonest.\n\n100% NTA", "NTA\n\nIt IS a cash grab, it IS rude, and it is NO more customary in Belgium than in the UK. A wedding gift is not a mandatory fee and while the married couple can express preferences and wishes, only love and/or politeness should rule the guest's choice , as to its content and value. \n\nWedding lists exist for that reason, so people can choose a gift they feel appropriate in value, beauty, utility, and cost , and yet stay within those the groom and bride wish to receive. If they only want cash, they should let the guests decide how much they're ready to give (which is often more according to their means than to the price they set to the relationship).  \n\nMaking a scene online and calling to other friends to guilt you into giving what she decided acceptable is terrible entitlement and attitude.", "i don't know actually.\n\nin some places, money as wedding gift is specifically the custom", "Reddit isn\u2019t exactly swarming with Belgians, and Belgium is not mentioned in the post title so how would they know to comment on this particular post?\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s one who found this. https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykqvzt/aita_for_telling_my_friend_her_demanded_wedding/iuv0tqz/", "Definitely not fancy. It\u2019s a potluck.", "Most weddings I've gone to (American) I brought a check in a card that went into a pretty decorated box near the guest book. Is she going to have a bouncer at the door who collects and counts the money? Not enough, no entry for you! Or since she sounds like a greedy grasping bride, will she be at the door to count the take, and deny entry, since it's not a custom in Belgium based on other replies, so she wouldn't be able to tell anyone else that she had set that as a rule.", "I am portuguese and it is expected to give money. I have never been to a wedding where the present wasn't money.\n\nHowever, it's not a set amount. You give a lot usually (my parents always said your cost plus something, meaning what you will cost at the wedding plus something is the minimum). But this is a potluck. People bringing food for everyone to eat. \n\nI've never heard of a wedding with minimum amount of money, especially if you know the person will be spending a lot when going to said wedding.", "Agree. There is not such thing as a minimum. The polite thing to do is if you give cash to cover the average cost of your meal and something more, or give a physical gift of a decent value emotional/price", "Hi fellow belgian here, never once heard of this 'custom'. Def NTA", "Yta and I would never have a \"friend\" like you.", "NTA, but it is a custom. Maybe (don't get me wrong here) she is from a gypsy family, maybe another background. \n\nIn my home country, we give cash gifts to weddings.

I\u2019m my best friend flew in from o/s to be my maid of honour and as she stayed at my place, accommodation was free. I also covered all of her bridesmaids costs, despite my other bridesmaid paying for either her hair or makeup because overseas guests have already paid more than their fair share! If you guys do make up though and you go along, don\u2019t get the artwork as that kind of thing whilst thoughtful, might not be to their taste at all and you\u2019re effectively getting someone a present they might hate and have to lie to you about for life.", "Turkish here. We are expected to give money or gold here. Gold is mainly what we call quarter but close relatives golden bracelets etc. The gold is usually returned when the person giving it or his child is getting married. But there is no upper or lower limit. Poor people are not expected to give money. On my wedding there were people who gave money equal to one dollar and I appreciated it knowing that they are very poor. I was just happy for them for having a nice night. But I heard of big fights between families for not giving equal gold. \nIn the end the money covers the costs of wedding and excess is used for the costs of establishing a new home. Furniture etc. \nLastly a wedding with just 100 people is called a wedding not crowded.", "NTA dictating the amount of cash has always been a tacky move.", "Belgian here, that amount is not customary!\nWhile we do give envelopes of money a lot as presents, the amount is completely up to the person giving the money.\n\nOf course, there are some numbers people tend to stick to, but that's more like \"make sure it's over 50 or 100 euros if you can afford it.\"\nThis also varies a lot based on family, friends, region...\n\nNTA big time", "NTA.\nWe are having a wishing well but we stipulated on our invite it\u2019s because we have been living together already so we don\u2019t need household items.

Take that money you were going to spend on flights, hotel, wedding outfits, and the \u00a3250, and treat yourself to a nice holiday on her wedding weekend. Maybe somewhere sunny.

I\u2019m not sure in Belgium customs but it definitely seems more like she having a wedding to make money off of.

Especially the guests that may need to travel and get a hotel for the night.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t be going!", "Well, in Spain it is also extremely common to make a cash gift, and in fact many people include the bank account number in the wedding invite so people know that's your preferred gift. And the amount of \\~250 sounds about right. The idea is to pay enough so the wedding pays for itself (\\~150 per guest in a normal wedding) and the remaining \\~100 to help the newly wed start their life together.\n\nBut...\n\n1) It is not mandatory. If someone makes a different gift, it is fine.\n\n2) You cut some slack to people coming from other countries, to students, and to people with lower salaries. If someone is already paying for a flight and a hotel, or if they are still a student, you don't expect them to also gift you the standard amount (unless they are very well-off).\n\nYou were wrong to doubt the custom, but right on all other points. I've been in a Belgium wedding myself as a guest, and while we knew we were expected to make a cash gift, no one told us about any minimum amount cos that's extremely rude.\n\nSo... all in all, NTA.", "Whatever you gift her, make sure it's \u00a3, not \u20ac", "NTA.

Generally your cash gift should cover at least your meal. Where I'm from it used to be only around \u00a350 a head (\u00a3100 per couple), nowadays more like \u00a3150 per couple would be expected. Maybe it's just a bit more expensive in Belgium, which would be where the \u20ac250 figure came from.\n\nHaving that said, you don't kick someone out of a wedding for not giving a gift - it's optional, generally just don't expect to get a gift at your own wedding if you didn't give one at theirs.", "NTA I am in another European country and cash is expected as a wedding gift, but only the closet family would be giving that much and as a couple.\n\nA couple going to the wedding would give between \u00a3120 to \u00a3150 (half that for a single person)", "Ok so she wants to game 27,000 from y\u2019all.

Very tacky and classless.", "Depends on the kind of weddings you are attending at. Where I am from we have open weddings with minimum amount of guests 2k and maximum 5k of guests and most of the time there is cocktail food or actual buffet/plate for each guest. There the norm is \u20ac50 euros unless is family/close friends where the amount can be up the 500-1/2000. But it\u2019s never obligatory for that amount.
