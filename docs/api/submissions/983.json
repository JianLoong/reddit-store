It's considered bad form to make a fuss if people bring a physical gift regardless, and setting a 'minimum donation' would be seen as incredibly rude and tacky.

I always say bring something if you like but what I want is for you to be there if you can to celebrate with me. As such I will never go to an event where I am required to give money or gifts to someone. This isnt to say that I dont gie gifts. I am actually the best gift giver.

If you've got coins (the more the better) you throw it on the dance floor for the bride an others to dance on. When the dance is over the bride and groom collect the coins with their hands.
