{"id": 12181, "submission_id": "11q6jcl", "title": "AITA for expecting my boyfriends parents to treat my daughter the same as his daughters?", "selftext": "I (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn\u2019t handle the fact he could coparent well and be amicable with his ex then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. \n\nAnyway since we\u2019ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it\u2019s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin\u2019s daughters by his parents. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she\u2019s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Martin\u2019s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.\n\nThey\u2019ll take Martin\u2019s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don\u2019t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They\u2019ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets and give them a couple of pounds here and there every so often but as for Scarlett, they might only give her one thing and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not fair for Scarlett.\n\nThe last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett\u2019s travel expenses, but that I\u2019d have to pay the rest.  \n\nI lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It\u2019s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn\u2019t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I\u2019m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I\u2019m bitter and jealous and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re married or living together. He used the example of the blanket being a really sweet gift that shows how much his mother cares. He also said it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for his parents to expect me to pay for my own child to go to Disney and that my parents don\u2019t need to pay anything at all for us. He also said I\u2019m raising my daughter to not learn the value of the word no and that she can just be expected to get whatever he wants. He also said that Joanna and Miley are not Scarlett\u2019s sisters, it\u2019s never been emphasised they were and they do not view Scarlett as that. He said that I need to \u2018get your arse in gear and realise nothing is being done to discriminate against or exclude Scarlett.\u2019\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I view Joanna and Miley as bonus daughters, hence why Scarlett calls them her sisters. Joanna and Miley do not view me as a mother figure in anyway, only as \u2018dad\u2019s girlfriend.\u2019 It really hurts but i don\u2019t think im pushy or anything. I just think of us as a blended family unit whereas Joanna and Miley have said im just the woman their dad is dating and Scarlett is nothing to them family wise. I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they\u2019re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it \u2018tolerate her.\u2019 Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I\u2019m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters and it greatly upsets Scarlett because she just wants to be included. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends and I want Joanna and Miley to be her friends.\n\nI have no family and Scarlett\u2019s fathers family aren\u2019t involved. I\u2019ve always tried my best to spoil her myself but it seems only fair since we\u2019re part of Martin\u2019s family now that she\u2019s treated the same as Joanna and Miley.", "created_utc": 1678705084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q6jcl/aita_for_expecting_my_boyfriends_parents_to_treat/", "score": 6809, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s spot on.\n\nYTA", "YTA, They have only known Scarlett for a few months. Of course they are going to treat her differently. You can't just demand that they feel a certain way. Besides that, they sound like they are treating your daughter pretty well with the gifts and offering to pay for a portion of your vacation. You sound very entitled and will likely pass that behaviour on to your daughter if you aren't careful.", "YTA. It sounds like they're trying, they are giving her thoughtful gifts and offering to help pay for you and Scarlett to go to Disney. That's pretty generous considering you're not married and they only met Scarlett a few months ago. Frankly, you sound ungrateful and grabby demanding that they treat her like an instant grandchild and lavish gifts upon her.\n\n It's also rather telling that you say their grandchildren were \"spoilt rotten\" by their grandparents at Christmas. It reeks of jealousy and makes we wonder why you want someone to spoil your daughter rotten, too.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine an adult saying \u201call they got my daughter was a super thoughtful knit blanket, and 3 other gifts\u201d that\u2019s\u2026 a lot.

Your boyfriend's children are also not your daughter's sisters, unless he adopts her. Not everyone will conform to your definition \"family\", deal with it or move on.", "YTA. You\u2019re not a blended family unit. You\u2019re not married or even live together. You are only their dads girlfriend and your daughter isn\u2019t their sister. She is not your boyfriends parents grandchild. His mom went above and beyond hand making a personalized gift for your daughter after barely even meeting her. Stop forcing yourself and your daughter on them. He was clear that if you can\u2019t respect boundaries like his coparenting relationship, he\u2019s done. It\u2019s likely he\u2019s going to be done with you if you keep forcing yourself and you daughter on his family with your delusions that you\u2019re a blended family. Clearly he nor his daughters or parents see you this way. Scarlett not having friends is a her problem. It\u2019s not surprising considering you\u2019re raising her to force herself on others when they put up clear boundaries", "He is right. I'm so sorry that you didn't grow up with a family and that your baby daddy dropped the ball. But you can't force your boyfriend and his parents to make up for that. His parents are either willing to or they are not. Feelings can't be forced. They are either there or they are not. With time, they may either develop or they may not. So:\n\n1. Give it time, see if things change the more time that they spend with you and get to know you both. \n\n   Or:\n\n2. Make peace with things as they are\n\n  Or:\n\n3: End things before you and your daughter get even more emotionally invested, only for that investment to not be returned. You're not being fair to yourself or your daughter. \n\nProps for letting go of your issues with his co-parenting arrangement. That must have been difficult for you. But it would have made you a major a-hole if you messed the co-parenting. \n\nOverall, YTA.\n\nEdited. To fix formatting issues.\n\n\nEdit 2: Regarding your edit, please stop forcing relationships. Not for yourself and not for your daughter. You're setting your daughter up for a world of hurt. And auditioning for the role of the wicked stepmother in Joanna and Miley's lives. Because if you continue pushing and pushing, that is what you are going to be to them. And your daughter will get hurt the most. I think moving in together should be shelved until these issues are resolved. Get into therapy to deal with your childhood trauma. In the meantime, please let Scarlett and the girls organically form a relationship without you hovering. You're not doing Scarlett any favors by forcing her onto the girls. Let her make her own friendships (doesn't have to be them). They will either ignore her (hurts her) or bully her/treat her badly (hurts her). So please stop. For her sake.\n\nYou might view Martin's family as yours but they clearly do not feel the same. I cannot say this enough, stop forcing relationships. Please get into therapy.

Your husband is right: it's not like you're married or living together. YTA for trying to force it, and being overly concerned that the grandparents are not spending as much money on Scarlett as you would like.\n\nI'm sure that in time, all your wishes will be fulfilled, and that after I would guess a relatively short 5 years or so of living with Martin, you and Scarlett will feel like full members of the family.

I strongly suggest you see a counselor to deal with your insecurities and jealousy", "YTA as gently as I can say this, YOU NEED HELP - you have a lot of unresolved issues and  unrealistic expectations.

I have 2 kids that are not my boyfriends children and I didn\u2019t meet his family until after we moved in together and I was already pregnant. Our daughter gets more overnight visits with his parents than my other 2. They\u2019ve treated us like family from the start and treat them like their grandchildren but you can\u2019t just expect that. I never once expected his parents to fill in that role for them. They chose to do that.", "YTA. Please take a step backwards and evaluate your relationship. It sounds like your view of the relationship (you're a blended a family, the kids are sisters) is not aligned with everyone else's (you are dating). From their perspective, they are being generous. They gave their son's girlfriend's daughter a Christmas gift! They offered to pay part of your way to Disney! That's incredibly generous considering you are their son's girlfriend! The issue here is the mismatch between that and how you feel about things. \n\nFWIW it sounds like you've had a tough life since childhood and have never had a real family. My heart goes out to you. Now you've found a family, but you aren't actually a full part of it yet. And if you keep acting like this they will probably cut you out", "YTA. Relationships need to run at their own speed. The main relationship here is 'you and your bf'. Everything around them is orbital and needs to find their own path around you guys. And you've been dating 2 years. You're recent with the grandparents. Your child is not related to them, and if you and Martin break up, they have zero obligation to see Scarlett. None. So pushing for wife behavior and status when you're still in the budding relationship stage \\_is\\_ the definition of pushing things. Let the girls find their own way. Don't force other people to be what you want of them.\n\nI think this comes down to you not having any family and having this 'expectation' of what family is and how they should act and you're wrong. All families are different. Time responses are different. And the more you push it, the more they're going to tell Martin not to bring you/Scarlett over, and Martin's going to get sick of it. And how you treat the girls.", "Lightly YTA because they are including Scarlett to the level they know her. If you don\u2019t involve your feelings in this and push/pressure for them to bond with her faster and now - they\u2019ll gradually and organically find balance with each other.\n\nMeanwhile, \n\n- recognize your kid is 10. 12 and 13 is a leap in that phase of childhood. They naturally would not include a 10 yo the way you\u2019d want. \n\nThey may start to be her guides, and later respect her for her strengths as they get to know her. You forcing it blocks that, cause they\u2019d naturally have their own boundaries - and some are just for now, but you forcing them to put walls up will mean they may not later.\n\n- You clearly have a void which you thought your BFs family would fill. Have you considered therapy to help you channel and manage these feelings? Fears of abandonment. It makes sense that a big move like this would make you feel the certainty you had prior is shaky, now there\u2019s a family you could lose and need to make it certain. Therapy may may even help you heal, so you don\u2019t start a cycle with your daughter feeling rejected/abandonment feelings because you project yourself\u2026and your unmet needs\u2026as S\u2019s needs right now. They actually may not be her needs, this is new to her too and her comfort would be her mother she\u2019s known her whole life - and everything else in doses at her pace.\n\nAnd that vision of a blended family, maybe then your BF can share it with you and be part of designing for it in a healthy way - but a vision is not enforced day one party alone, you build up to it. Same goes for strong bonds and relationships, you need to stop and let things flow and develop naturally. To do so, you need to let go of the scarcity mindset\u2019 and get comfortable with the idea this is good and safe. And if things don\u2019t work out or feelings get hurt, you\u2019re able to work through them - it\u2019s not the end, you\u2019re not at risk of losing it all if you don\u2019t secure it asap.

Hear their feelings, values, concerns and boundaries out. Accept their generosity and kindness at face value.\n\nEg. ASK them - What would be comfortable for you? Or  \u2018do you see a point when you\u2019d feel comfortable having Scarlett sleepover?

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn\u2019t handle the fact he could coparent well and he amicable then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. \n\nAnyway since we\u2019ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it\u2019s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin\u2019s daughters. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she\u2019s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Marin\u2019s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.\n\nThey\u2019ll take Martin\u2019s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don\u2019t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They\u2019ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets but nothing for Scarlett.\n\nThe last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett\u2019s travel expenses, but that I\u2019d have to pay the rest.  \n\nI lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It\u2019s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn\u2019t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I\u2019m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I\u2019m bitter and jealous and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re married or living together. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've been the daughter in a blended family several times over and let me tell you that I wouldn't have been thrilled if I had been dumped off at some stranger's house for a sleepover because my parent was insistent that *I* should want it. No, ma'am. I also never once expected Christmas gifts from any \"bonus grandparents\" I may have had at any given time. Did it kind of suck to see other people get more stuff? Sure. Was I entitled to the same treatment their grandkids got? Absolutely not.\n\nSounds like you have some issues you need to work out from having grown up in care, which I'm certain couldn't have been easy. There are other ways for your daughter to connect to potential future grandparents and her potential stepsisters that have nothing to do with material things, but those connections take time. You can't force a relationship between teenage girls either. Trust me on that one. If your BF's daughters decide they want a relationship with Scarlett, one will form. Your interference and demanding that your daughter not be the odd one out is, in fact, making her the odd one out. \n\nJust stop. Get some therapy.", "Relationships take time to build and it sounds like you\u2019re pushing too soon.

To your boyfriend's family, you are his girlfriend, and Scarlett is his girlfriend's daughter. Even though you have been dating for two years, you are not part of his family. That's just how it works. As your relationship develops, if it does, his family will get to know you both and include you more and more. If you keep up this \"we're family too\" attitude, you will just alienate everyone and prevent any bonds from being made. These relationships take time to develop and are not guaranteed. You should step back and look at this objectively. Your expectations are over the top. You are not providing any real life guidance for your daughter, who may suffer the most through this.\n\nYour boyfriend's parents seem like they respect his relationship with you and Scarlett, because unlike what you believe, they have been accepting of you and generous as well. You may want to go to therapy to help you understand this. It could help both you and Scarlett tremendously.\n\nFor now, YTA.", "YTA.  Lots of bad vibes here.  You are NOT family.  You are just dating Martin.  The 12 and13 year old girls have little in common with a 10 year old when playing.  You can't push children together.  They are NOT sisters.  You are trying to be their mother.  You are not and never will be.  They have a mother and it isn't you. Seems like Martin is starting to see you as you really are.  Don't plan on making that trip to Disney as I think Martin will be breaking up with you soon.", "YTA that family doesn\u2019t have to include you or your daughter in anything!

And by default, sadly his daughter (PS, not really wondering, it's pretty clear)", "I think yta. \n\nSorry but I will never understand this position that seems to be predominantly single mothers. \"Your family must accept my child as if you have claim to my child when you in fact do not because my kids dad isnt around so now you have to fill that role and your family too\" \n\nI've been with my partner 4.5 years.

As for right now, your daughter is not their grandchild. All your comments mention your daughter's lack of friends and family. I'm sorry that yall are isolated but shoehorning your way into a family is not going to create the closeness you want. You keep saying you see yourselves as a family unit. It is obvious from the comments of Martin's daughters that this is a one sided view. Just because you see them as your family doesn't mean they see you as theirs. Furthermore, as a non family member, the grandparents have treated your daughter with the utmost kindness. You had better start being grateful before you lose your boyfriend and isolate you and your daughter further.", "Yta\n\nLet's unpack this and seriously you need to listen.\n\nThey've known martins daughter \"THEIR GRANDDAUGHTERS\" for years.\n\nThey've known YOUR DAUGHTER for months.\n\nYou're not living together, you're not engaged.\n\nBlending a family takes time and effort not a forceful hand which you have been trying push and demand.\n\nThe truth in this whole matter is that despite what fairy tale you have in your head, you are trying to force martins daughters and family to suddenly treat your daughter exactly the same when they don't even know her.\n\nHis mother took time out of her life to knit her a personalized blanket and have her some gifts. How about be thankful rather than demanding with a chip on your shoulder.\n\nYour daughters father and his family arent involved and that sucks but not something you can control, you can't control this situation either but you're trying to control it.\n\nIf you really want her to be accepted as family and for her to be treated equally spend the time it takes for that to happen, successful blended families do not magically happen overnight and his daughters are correct you are currently dad's gf and nothing more. If you want it to become more stop pushing for the end result when you haven't even gotten through the beginning.", "I'm reading all your comments OP, I think you gotta absorb what ppl are trying to get at. You have just been dating a man, not married to one. It's not fair that the grandparents would be expected to hold your child to the same value. 2 years isn't a lot and as you said, they only recently met her.\n\nMaybe once you guys get married, you can start adjusting your expectations but all you are is dating. The grandparents have worked so hard at trying to make your daughter feel included. In fact, they didn't even need to include her in the Disneyland trip. It was awfully generous in contributing something towards the 2 of you.\n\nTry to understand the comments everyone is making, lots of really good points here.", "It may be time for you to leave this relationship.

If she genuinely likes the girls and Martin's parents she should show interest in them, but know that rejection is possible, for no other reason than not being compatible.

As a parent we always want what\u2019s best for our kids and feel they deserve the world.\n\nHowever as parents we need separation our own desires and expectations from reality.  The reality of this situation is that Martin is just your boyfriend you might have a great time and he probably involves your daughter in activities but that does not mean that you guys are one unit. Maybe in time it can change into that but right now you guys are not there. His parent are no obligated to get your daughter anything and that fact that his mom made her some so sweet and personal was an amazing gift. His daughters are not your daughters sisters they are acquaintances.\n\nMy suggestion for you and your daughter is to find out what your daughter likes and get her involved in a group of kids with similar interest. Example if she loves art get her to join an art class this way she grows her friend group.", "YTA. And you\u2019re showing your partner that you\u2019re being a gold digger and nothing more.

At the end of the day they aren\u2019t her bio grandparents and they have only met her a few times. However they are trying. Very thoughtful too if I might add.\n\nYou are expecting way too much from everyone including his children. You are being overly pushy on how you think you all should be together.

To put it bluntly it\u2019s not your in laws fault that your baby\u2019s daddy isn\u2019t involved and that you have no family. That\u2019s not their burden.

That gut punch when we realize that our child doesn\u2019t have a tribe to invite to dance recitals is really painful. It is not fair, because we see what a beautiful person our children are. It is only natural that we want to build for them what we didn\u2019t have and that we will be extra sensitive sometimes because of our histories.\n\nSometimes, it helped to put things into perspective.

You guys aren't living together, you aren't married, you aren't even engaged, FFS. To expect Martin's parents to treat your daughter, who they've only met a few months ago, the same as they treat their bio granddaughters is entitlement at it's worst. Get a grip.

Blended families can be complicated, and you are looking for the family unit you did not have, but unfortunately here, YTA. \n\nYou said yourself, your daughter only met them a few months ago.

They don't need to pay for you AT ALL. \n\nYour best bet here is to allow the relationship to foster on its own, otherwise it'll create resentment.", "Soft, but firm YTA. Soft because I think I understand where it comes from. You have no family. Scarlett has no family. And that isn't fair.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that you can kind of just grab another family. Not even when you are dating one of them. Not even when you marry. \n\nThis is a family like you would like: loving parents and grandparents. Your partner co-parenting with his ex (you would be much able to cope when this wasn't smoothly, but it also shows how good this family that is putting the wellbeing for their kids above all is working).\nThis is the family you want your daughter to have. \n\nWhile this is an understandable wish, this is absolutely nothing you can request. There is only one one member of the family that is connected to you: the man you are dating. And there is none that is directly connected to Scarlett. \n\nThere are cases where those families grow together, but that is mostly the case when there is an absent parent. \n\nAnd while you can ask your partner to love you, you can't ask his daughters to consider you their mom, or Scarlett their sister. Or his parents to have any relationship with your daughter. The kids have to treat you with respect. And they are not allowed to be mean to Scarlett. But that's it. \nThe grandparents don't live with you and they don't need to have any relationship with Scarlett. But the grandmother still spent hours knitting for her. It would be okay if they go to Disneyland with the family.

If this is a deal breaker for you you might want to move on.", "YTA, but softly. I think people here are not being particularly understanding about your own background, the difficulty of not having even a co-parent in your ex. \n\nI made my judgment what it was because I think you are coming across as entitled, and not seeing the forest through the trees. If they weren't trying at all, that would be one thing, but it seems that everyone is, and you have to let relationships develop naturally. The girls likely won't see you as a mother figure because their mother is active in their lives, but over time hopefully you can bond with them more and not just be seen as dad's girlfriend. It seems the grandparents are trying - I do not think it's fair to automatically assume everyone gets the exact same, and like I said, from my vantage point it does seem they are trying.\n\nI know you care about your daughter, and that it's been the two of you for a long time. Just trust your partner, trust your situation, and do what you can to see when people are trying and things are getting more positive.

I can tell you one thing, OP is ensuring that this family is never successfully blended, if things ever even get to that point between her and Martin. My parents divorced and remarried and it is hard enough to blend a family under ideal circumstances (and I think both my parents and step parents did a pretty good job), being pushy in any way is 100% a recipe for disaster. \nOP also sounds a little delusional in regards to exactly what the status of the relationship is but that\u2019s kind of another story\u2026", "It\u2019s not even age appropriate to include her daughter in the friends group.

It's ridiculous and insane to expect that CHILDREN will make up for and bridge the gaps adults created in Scarlett's life. Nowhere in the post or any of the replies does OP accept ANY responsibility for those gaps OR for the EFFORT necessary for the girls to develop a relationship. Instead she's demanding that these children pretend a stranger is their sister. \n\nYou might be able to get away with that if the other child is also an only child, but not where they're blood related and have grown up together--they know what SISTER means and dad's girlfriend's daughter that you barely know isn't it. \n\nYes, it was harsh to call her a gold digger (OP).

They need stability and parenting by both of their parents, this is infinitely better than the hateful petty warring that some divorced parents go for. As a child of divorce, this looks ideal and works best for everyone. This is a hill worth dying on, and your partner putting his kids first here is right.

Blankets like that, with embroidery, take a long time to make. Weeks if you have time, months if not, and they're not cheap. Yarn alone can be pricey, not to mention the skill and labour.

They've got divorced parents, and you may not be the first person their dad has dated since the divorce. They're also going through the usual teenage stuff like puberty and school. They also shouldn't be forced to view you and Scarlett as closer than they feel comfortable. Depending on how long you and Martin waited to introduce each other to the kids, they have known you less than 2 years. They also still have a mom. You don't need to be a mother figure, a step-parent (if that role ends up being given to you) has a different role to a parent.\n\n>I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they\u2019re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it \u2018tolerate her.\u2019 Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I\u2019m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters\n\nThere may only be 2-3 years age difference between them, but that's more than enough to have wildly different friend groups.

I think that is my number 1 thing I've been wanting for years. There's a lot of love in handmade quilts, blankets, and anything else that's knitted or crocheted.\n\nPeople just assume that since they can find subpar mass produced items for cheap that that is the actual price a bespoke handmade item is.", "Just reread Cinderella and you\u2019ll see how it all turns out", "Also without the customization it\u2019s lovely that they got her a handcrafted gift. OOP even says it must have taken weeks to make.", "I thought the same. Even if they were actual sisters, no one should be forcing a sibling to share their friend group with another sibling. A 10 year old has no business anyway hanging out with a 12/13 year old in that setting.", "Recognizing and overcoming a toxic mindset is worthy of praise. Not everyone does it.", "It occurred to me that the other girls potentially have one as well, and it was a way of welcoming her into the family. But I could be wrong.", "Not to mention per her edit, it bothers her that they don't see her as a mom and just as their dad's girlfriend. Why would they view her as their mom, they have one! I empathize with OP for wanting a blended family but this is the other perspective of all the horror stories on AITA about step-parents trying to shortcut their way to a full on family and OP's not even a step-parent.", "She\u2019s not in her right mind. She wants to take over Martin\u2019s little family and ignore that his daughters already have a family. She wants to be the only mom figure, so the five of them can be a cozy little ready made family and his ex will be an afterthought, the same way that her own baby daddy is barely involved. She can\u2019t stand the two girls having anything Scarlett doesn\u2019t have. Incredibly messed up.\n\nAt first I was sympathetic towards OP because she never experienced a loving family. But the more I read her comments the more I realize she has bad intentions.", "Last Christmas I made my nieces blankets. I'm a pretty quick crocheter. The blankets were a  really simple stitch and only a 5'x5' couch blanket. Each one still took about 10 hours to make. Each was about $135 (CAD) dollars worth of yarn and at minimum wage ($15 here in ontario) that's $150 in labour hours. So if you wanted to put a cash value on them they were $285 dollar blankets!", "My new stepfather did that with my younger siblings (15 and 19), he said if they respected them they'll call him dad and not his name. I just call him his name and made it very clear that my father is my father, and my step father that passed away is my stepfather, and he was just him. Nothing special to me.", "The customization shows it was *always* meant with her in mind though.

That kind of talk tells me so much about who she is as a person, and growing up without a proper family isn't an excuse for this kind of attitude.", "So this. I maybe didn't appreciate the afghan my grandma made for me when I was 12-13. I loved it, don't get me wrong. It was huge and thick and warm.

Miss you Grandma Max!", "Coupled with \"...weeks knitting apparently...\" \n\nThat made me say \"asshole.\"", "**Foster parent perspective here!!** I agree with this comment. There is potentially another layer to this story. As a child in care, OP has experienced being folded into a family instantaneously.  When a child moves into a foster home, the family are expected to treat the children as equals. Equal gifts, quality time and opportunities with all the children in the home, biological or foster children alike. \n\nOP may not realize that this isn't how it works in other families. In dating relationships, grandparents are not expected to instantaneously accept new grandchildren.  It takes time to build those relationships.  It does sound like they are trying to include your daughter. But you can't expect them to make this leap instantaneously.  You are new to their family and so is your daughter. Take it slow and don't push them away. They are not paid support in your daughter's life, they are choosing to be there, so everything they do is voluntary.  Let their love grow slowly.", "Oh honey. This actually breaks my heart. I think you\u2019re being the asshole here but it\u2019s because you\u2019ve never learned how to family. \n\nJust stop. I know you want to be loved and cherished and spoiled and you want that for Scarlett. That want is okay. But you can\u2019t go around bean-counting like that. \n\nYou have to pivot from leaning into your disappointment to appreciating people\u2019s generosity. You legitimately have gotten a raw deal, the people who were supposed to love and care for you unconditionally early on did not or could not. That is tragic. But here is the thing: no one else owes \nyou the kind of love and commitment that parents owe their children. \n\nPlease go to therapy and grieve that as much and as long as you need to because it\u2019s actually tragic. But don\u2019t take it out on your boyfriend or his family because you\u2019ll lose them. And from what you\u2019ve written, they sound like good people.", "Exactly this! OP\u2019s desire to be included and for her and her daughter to be viewed as \u201cfamily\u201d to the boyfriend\u2019s parents and daughters is *totally* understandable, but what OP has to understand is that these types of bonds and relationships can\u2019t be *forced*. And unfortunately that\u2019s what this reads as: that OP is trying to *force* a familial bond that not all parties are ready for. \n\nThe length of the relationship (2 years), the fact that they\u2019re not married *and* the fact that they\u2019re not living together are *all* factors here. Generally one, two, or ALL of the milestones above are reached before extended family begins treating additions to the family as \u201cgenuine family\u201d. I get that this situation is hurtful to OP, but she needs to understand that normally things just don\u2019t work the way she\u2019s wanting them to. Trying to force these relationships or rushing the process is just going to frustrate the boyfriend (and possibly also his family) to the point where he may feel like he needs to take a step back and put some space between himself and OP.\n\nETA: also, the embroidered knitted blanket that OP\u2019s daughter received from her boyfriend\u2019s mother *actually* sounds like an incredibly thoughtful and wonderful gift. I\u2019m assuming OP has never knitted or embroidered, otherwise she\u2019d (hopefully) acknowledge just how much time and WORK that goes into such a gift\u2026", "I love your thoughtful comment. I want to add to it though. Younger children always want to hang out with those slightly older. The older children are always reluctant to hang out with the younger ones. If you try and force his daughters into accepting yours, you will push them farther away.  Accept older kids boundaries, don\u2019t push and it MAY happen. Push her on them, and it definitely won\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s unfair that his daughters have more. More family, more money, more friends. However you chose to have your daughter with the circumstances. Don\u2019t make her insecure. Make her grateful for what she does have. His mom making her a homemade item means a lot!!!  They will come around if you stay together and are grateful, not demanding.", "Perfect response. I would also add that trying to force a 10 yr old onto 13 & 12 yr olds is not going to work. While they are close in age, there is a world of difference in maturity. \nYou can't force these things. Try to relax and not demand relationships that need to form naturally. \nBy the way, a blanket that someone took months to make, that's a very kind gesture. \nI'll go with a gentle AH.", "Yes, this is so perfectly put.\n\nOP, if you marry and/or move in with him, that will likely change things, but right now you\u2019re a girlfriend of 2 years whose kid they just met a few months ago. It sounds like they\u2019re trying. If you and Martin can afford it, chip in together to go to Disney Paris with all 3 girls and the grandparents. Not only will it be fun, but they can all get to know each other better. \n\nNAH is my vote.", "And since when is a hand-knitted blanket (that took months) a thoughtless gift?", "I agree with this. OP is behaving like TA, but she probably doesn't understand that this is AH behavior. This is the best kind of A; most of the A here kinda know it and just don't care, but OP sounds like she does care and is willing to learn! She was jealous of her boyfriend's relationship wth his ex, but she's learned that it's possible to get along with and coparent well with an ex even after the feelings are gone. \n\nNow she needs to learn that you can't just insert yourself and your child into another family and have \"instant family.\" Her boyfriend's parents have only met her daughter a few times, it's beyond reasonable to expect equal treatment to the granddaughters whom they've known and loved since they were babies.\n\nIt sounds like \"Grandma\" is attempting to be welcoming to OP and her daughter, and OP is expecting way too much. This can only hurt her in the end.", "Yeah the most telling line in all of this is that she never had a family. (And w the father he\u2019s not even involved) She\u2019s jumping the queue in her mind because she wants it so bad and projecting it onto her daughter or fair her daughter. It\u2019s just an instinct but she\u2019s way off. These things can take years and this may set that back. \n\nSoft TA to OP. Hope you can repair the damage and manage your and your daughter\u2019s expectations moving forward.", "I totally agree with this and think it\u2019s an issue with OP that she needs to work on. I grew up in a very abusive home, and when I met my ex husbands family for the first time I was defensive and uncomfortable for a while. The first Christmas I met them, they got me an iPod and they also found a good running car that they gave me for free. They\u2019re wonderfully nice people but it freaked me out and made me suspicious like they were going to hold it over my head or something in the future. It had nothing to do with them and everything to do with my own family being that way all growing up. \n\nIt sounds like OP is jealous that her boyfriend\u2019s children are being treated so lavish/kindly by their grandparents while her daughter has never had that from her father. \n\nApologize to your boyfriend and work on your issue. They sound like lovely people who are trying.", "What a lovely and compassionate comment, the world needs more of this.", "Love this reply. Obviously OP is way out of line here but it\u2019s hard to judge her given that she\u2019s never known what family is like and is clearly starved for it. Good advice in this comment.", "The handmade blanket sounds like a grandma gift.\nNobody spends weeks hand crafting an item for a stranger.\nThat blanket means something and I hope your daughter comes to treasure it", "Hopefully OPs boyfriend sees the red flags and doesn\u2019t officially blend the family through Marriage. Because I feel like OP\u2019s next issue will be the college fund. OP will be mad that Miley and Joanna have all this money to go to their dream schools, while Scarlett didn\u2019t get none (or barely any) from Martins family. OP will then try to take money from their college funds to fund Scarlett.", "Surprised I'm not seeing this more. Even if everything else OP wanted was being done, it still would be bizarre to expect 12/13 year olds to welcome a 10 year old into their group.", "Op didn't know the significance of that gift, both the welcome part and the true time-material costs wise.", "As someone who grew up with a father/father\u2019s side of the family who just didn\u2019t want me, I\u2019d have enjoyed just being able to be there.  That blanket would have meant the world to me!", "I knit obsessively and also concur, lol\n\nHonestly, the more passionate I've gotten about knitting, the less willing I am to knit for other people. People simply do not appreciate handmade items, and that lack of appreciation becomes more and more noticeable as the quality of your work increases and their enthusiasm remains underwhelming.", "OP said she grew up in care so I think she just doesnt realise what a big gesture it was.

It was a gift for his first baby and he thought it was so thoughtful even though it was a basic stitch that he kept sending us pictures of his son with the blanket.\n\nThat small baby blanket took me 2 months to make, juggling between work and university.", "I thought the exact same thing. I bet that blanket was their way of welcoming her and including her in a way they feel is meaningful and also appropriate for the stage of their relationship with her. I\u2019m willing to bet over time they would treat her like their own but that relationship needs time to develop. \n\nI feel like OP just wants that family so badly for herself and her daughter that she doesn\u2019t realize she is being unreasonable in her expectations.", "And that's just the minimum to cover the cost and time, let alone to make any profit!

This was over 30+ years ago but even back then the yarn was costly.  I made a queen-sized afghan for my Mom as a Christmas gift for her new bed.  I took this afghan to work with me so that I could work on it on my breaks, it took me close to two month to finish.  I got so many offers for that afghan from the nurses and doctors who were also on their breaks as they watched me work on it.  I crocheted full size afghans for my kids in their favorite colors.  And my 30 year old daughter have passed that afghan down to her daughter when she turned 6 (now 8).  I crocheted an afghan between a twin and full size but specifically tailored to my brother's 6'3\" height so that he could tuck the afghan underneath his feet and still have it comes up to his neck.  And I custom sized one for my 5'5\" SIL.  Even today (30+ years), they **all** still have the afghans that I made for them and they still use them.  OP don't realize the skill and time it took personally hand knit a blanket that was personalized with her daughter's name.

But I think its beacause you dont know any better. I can knit but I prefer to crochet. Just the amount of work that goes into that blanket oh my gosh. That's a huge gift. Forget how much yarn costs. That woman spent hours sitting there pouring love into that blanket and you brush it off. \n\nListen to your BF and stop pushing people away by being overbearing. Get some counseling because I don't think, given your background, that you know what a normal family unit is like. It's not the Brady bunch where everyone instantly bonds and is best friends. And apologize to your boyfriend and explain that you don't understand. Ask him to help you understand but stop demanding. Man, you've only been together 2 years.

So bad to the point that I boxed it up and never used it because it was practically destroyed.\n\nFor one of my birthdays, my grandmother conspired with my wife and sneaked the quilt out. Grandma hand repaired this quilt. New stuffing, replacing damaged parts with new parts, etc. And when she gave it to me, she was extremely apologetic because it was so old, she could not get it perfect as portions had stretched through decades of use and it wasn't square anymore. I'm still appalled that she would find it necessary to apologize for such a thing.\n\nWife and I make great money. We have a house full of expensive electronics.

I\u2019m a slow crocheter so I take even longer to finish projects. The cost it would take to sell an actual blanket that I made would be SO high.

The loss for your daughter would be devastating.\n\nAs a child of multiple (6 between them) divorces, I can honestly say that what you wrote is absolutely true. After each divorce, the \"grandparents\" tried to stay in our lives, but fights between the parents got in the way. Nobody was thinking about the kids in these situations. This mother wants what SHE wants...what about what the little girl wants? Does she want to be pushed into the other girl's circles or activities? I seriously doubt it since she is only tolerated by them. The mom needs to quit pushing her feelings on to the daughter. Give it time and let it develop naturally and maybe the other girls will come around, or not. It's not guaranteed!  \n\n\nI feel for the little girl but her mom needs to back off and let the relationship happen naturally and given time, it will but pushing it is going to end up with the mother (and daughter) being pushed out the door and then the little girl is twice rejected.

The post just gave me the impression of someone who\u2019s bounced around without a family growing up, then no friends, then a kid but no previous spouse really. This relationship is potentially the first opportunity she has of being *calibrated* to what to expect from a family. Or relationships.", "Op hasnt had a family, what do you expect?

Handmade keepsake gifts such as this are the most telling. If Future Step-Grandparents make something like that, that is basically her welcoming the child into the family with this rite of passage gift. \n\nIf they didn't like the kid, they would only give gift cards or very basic toys that would break easily or... nothing at all. They're also trying to appeal to her age, not treating her completely like a baby, but still giving her a toy, plus gift cards so that she can buy what she wants. \n\nI think the gifts are beautiful and thoughtful. \n\nOp, please take a closer look at these responses. These people are treating your child so well! They're learning to love her already. And they invited you two on a FAMILY trip! Of course they can't pay for everyone outright. Who has that kind of money right now?! Disney is EXPENSIVE. But they still want you there enough to help you with the costs!", "Agreed. OP, I think you need to have a gentle word with yourself about this.\n\nIt took me months (around work etc) to crochet my son a blanket. It takes hours of work and care to knit one, and embroider her name on. That is saying *more* about how much they care, than buying stuff. Not to mention that yarn costs an absolute bomb.\n\nSecondly, I understand as well as anyone that what you want is the safety of a family. Other than my kids, my family is made up of unrelated people I've been fortunate enough to meet over the years - I really get this.\n\nBut you don't get to decide how others feel, or when they feel that way.

Com takes images and converts them into graphs IIRC.", "Being as they just met a few months ago, that puts us right around Christmas. So the fact that her boyfriends mom put that much thought and care into her gifts is actually pretty amazing. Weeks on a custom, embroidered blanket AND a few other gifts? They already sound accepting of OPs daughter! \n\nIf OP can manage to not sabotage this, it sounds like it can end up being built up into a wonderful blended family dynamic. But she has to realize these things take time and need to happen naturally. Her and her daughter can\u2019t be forced into the other family\u2019s lives, especially at this point where they aren\u2019t even living together.

She wants a family for her daughter, maybe for herself too, since she never had that and can\u2019t give that to her daughter. I think it\u2019s less about the cost of things and more that she wants her daughter to be their granddaughter and therefore treated the exact same as their actual granddaughters. To me this is shown in her trying to push a sister relationship on the girls when the girls are not ready for that at all. She wants her daughter to be treated by the two girls the same as they treat each other because she wants her daughter to have sisters.", "OP says outright that she tries to spoil Scarlett. In case there's any question, attempting to actively spoil your child is *never* a good idea. It's one thing to want them to have a more comfortable life than you if you grew in the system like OP did, but there's a big difference between that and spoiling the kid rotten. Which is clearly what OP is doing, since three presents at Christmas is treated with contempt and a \"just that\". \n\nWild to me as well that this woman is placing all these expectations when they're not even living together, never mind married!

I DIY\u2019d some of my daughters toys. It would have been quite a bit cheaper and easier to just buy them. So all in all, Martin\u2019s mother put more of her money and thought into Scarlett\u2019s gift than all the money she threw at Miley and Joanna, at least that time.
