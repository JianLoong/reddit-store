Lately he\u2019s been changing the way he speaks and acts. He left graduate school to become an electrician. He will make more money being an electrician and that has made him much happier. But since joining the trade he has become much more vulgar, if that makes sense. He just speaks with a level of callousness. He\u2019s is meaner and make mean spirited jokes at me and others. He is overall happier but I just don\u2019t like this new side of him.\n\nAnyways this past weekend a friend invited us over for a get together at her home. I knew everyone there except a couple of people, one of which was a girl in a wheelchair. I learned she had a medical condition that left her legs very weak. She was nice to us for the most part. At some point in the evening we started talking about New Year\u2019s resolution. And she said she wanted to try new things and new adventures. My boyfriend then blurted out \u201clike what wheelchair racing?\u201d. The whole room went silent. She looked hurt. And before I could apologize or say anything he says \u201cwhat she\u2019s in a wheelchair, it\u2019s funny\u201d. My friend told him to leave. Which he did, as I was apologizing profusely he came back into the room and said \u201chas anyone ever tipped you over? And if are you like a turtle on its back? Needing help to get back up\u201d. I began crying and apologizing more while telling him to leave.\n\nWhen I went outside I noticed he had left me. I sat on the curb crying. I have never felt so embarrassed in my life. My friend who owned the house came to me and asked wtf was his problem. I said I didn\u2019t know. She said I could come back inside but I couldn\u2019t face the rest of the party. I said it was fine. I got an Uber and went home.\n\nMy boyfriend wasn\u2019t home. I texted him and he said he was at his friends house and they were gonna have a bbq and watching some game. I asked him wtf his problem was and how he felt it was okay to speak to people that way. He then got mad at me and told me to stop trying to create drama. He said she was in a wheelchair and needs to learn to laugh about it. I told him I didn\u2019t want to see him that night. And he didn\u2019t respond. He didn\u2019t come home until Monday morning and it was just to get his tools for work. And when he got home he ignored me which made me yell at him. \n\nI told my sister and my mom who both agreed he was out of line. But that maybe I am being too harsh. And need to apologize for getting mad at him. Was I the asshole here? I just don\u2019t know anymore.", "created_utc": 1701821289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bqoiq/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_for_making_fun/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course he's wrong for saying those things about someone. The issue isn't really even that he made fun of someone in a wheelchair. It's that he felt it was okay to mock someone.

What a dick.\n\n>He said she was in a wheelchair and needs to learn to laugh about it.\n\nIt's not his place to tell somebody else how to handle their disabilities. Nobody in that room thought he was funny. To top it off, he came back after he had already been asked to leave just to double down on the behavior. It wasn't about being funny at that point. He just wanted to get another jab in to retaliate for being kicked out.\n\n>But that maybe I am being too harsh. And need to apologize for getting mad at him. \n\nWhy? He left you without a ride and ignored you for several days. If anything, you're cutting him too much slack. He should consider himself lucky that you don't pack up your shit and leave. He wants to disappear for days at a time, there's no reason for you to stick around and wait for him.\n\nI'm not sure what he was like when you met or what inspires this change in behavior, but he's becoming a bully straight up.

As a last ditch effort I would suggest having him see a neurologist to rule out any personality changing brain tumors just to give him the benefit of the doubt here, but short of a medical anomaly the fact is he has *chosen* to become a cruel person.

She grew up in a different time and that's what her generation did.  Secondly, he's not changing because that's what his new group of friends does now.  He was in grad school and now he works as an electrician, and he's trying to fit in by acting like they would.  If he's never done this before but willing to do it now without blinking an eye, he's made his choice and he's not going back.

You mean, acknowledging the drama he created?\n\nIt seems pretty clear cut that he is trying to be a bully on purpose.

He met her only that night, so his opinion on what she \"needs to learn\" is worth jack shit. \n\nAnd as it turns out, a lot of wheelchair users do know how to laugh, are funny af and will absolutely joke about their disability ON THEIR OWN TERMS. Your boyfriend's jokes were offensive, *boring because overused,* and dumping a person out of a wheelchair can literally kill them (depending on their disability). \n\nIf he doesn't apologize I would run, because he will absolutely embarrass you again.", "Nta\n\nI love inappropriate humour and laughing about life and tragedy.\n\nBut what your bf did was not doing that, the poor girl was a human being with goals of having new experiences, your bf reduced her to just her wheelchair and disability in front of her friends and mocked her about it.

He's cheating", "The stories I've heard from wheelchair using friends, yes to this extent and worse. Which is not an excuse at all, if anything it makes this conduct worse because it's likely not a complete anomaly for this person they met at the party. It wears down on your mental health to never be able to escape comments like this even when at the home of someone you know and like.", "I think it\u2019s pretty clear that she included the information about the career/social stuff to illustrate that he\u2019s recently made major life changes, and that he\u2019s spending time with an entirely new set of people.", "It had everything to do with her yelling, the whole reason he was ignoring her in the first place was because she criticized his behavior at the party and then again over text. It's not like he was just incidentally ignoring her and she's bringing up a completely unrelated incident. She's yelling him for ignoring her *instead of apologizing for his behavior* which was reprehensible.", "I have, as well.  People feel entitled to information, particularly around sex, from people in wheelchairs.  It\u2019s mind-boggling, not that they wonder about it but they have the gall to ask.", "Disagree", "Being in a wheelchair I can confirm this. I'm pretty open and not really bothered by any questions but after a while the question \"can you still get a boner?\" Gets rather annoying."]}
