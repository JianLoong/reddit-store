I yelled back at her that she can't expect me to be mum number 2 at 15, how she's hardly ever around and even when she is she stays in her room watching Korean dramas and only ever comes out to make dinner or about at us.

How if I \"did nothing\" then she wouldn't be able to go to her meetings, go on stupid bike riders with her boyfriend or go to conserts when she know damn well she can't afford it and let's all of us down. I told her I won't, and can't be, the 'perfeft' daughter who never gets overwhelmed or depressed or just generally fed up with being nothing more to her then a second parent and told her that I can't watch the boys, make them lunch, dinner, put them to bed, read them bedtime stories, make sure to pick up the phone when she calls and remember to do all the chores.\n\nShe yelled that I wasn't a second parent and she was trying her best, and asked if she was a Gillian for wanting to enjoy her life.\nAgain I yelled and said \"you are if you're 'enjoying your life' at the expense of your kids, the ones you chose to have. They aren't my kids, and they aren't my responsibility yet you make it that way, of course I'm pissed at you for it.\n\nWe haven't really talked since then outside of her making petty sly remarks whenever I walk past, calling me lazy and a bitch under her breath like a little fukn kid.

So its her responsibilty. \n\nTo help out here or there at age 15 is a total reasonable thing to expect. So you watching the kids as long as she is at her meetings is OK. \n\nBut you being responsible and in charge most of the time is not. And the reason is not important.

Your mom is abusing you and won\u2019t take accountability for her actions and sounds to immature to do so.

I had no choice but to run away to my grandparents on another island when I was 18 or else I would be dead, but it has severely damaged my younger siblings who I raised.

My story was very similar to yours, I also have ADHD and ASD and my relationship was similar with my mum. Please get some mental help because when you break you will need it.
