You didn\u2019t ask to be born, you had no say in your creation, you didn\u2019t ask to be a role model or caretaker to more children that you yourself did not create therefore her logic of your mother \u201cowing you nothing\u201d is a moot point because she made her choices therefore you owe her nothing because having you and your siblings was HER decision. Parentification is no joke and is sadly extremely common (I went through this myself- my mother also had mental health issues as well as alcoholism and drug addiction) the best advice I can give you is to stay strong- do you have any other family in the picture? Your dad? Can you move in with any of them? I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re in the states but leaving you constantly caring for all of her responsibilities is something CPS can help with- their goal is to bring families together not rip them apart. We dealt with CPS all the time due to my mother\u2019s issues. I personally couldn\u2019t deal with her and emancipated myself- it was hard but I made it. I cut off all my toxic family\u2026 your mum seems to be doing a good job getting herself in a position to have 0 relationship to you as you get old enough to move on with your own life as an adult. There\u2019s a whole community of people who\u2019ve been in your position on here and it may be helpful for you-                              r/raisedbynarcissists", "And she gave birth to you so she absolutely does owe you!", "Hi OP, I just saw your comment after posting mine. I had asked if there's anyone you can talk to about this situation. You sound like a very strong person! Is there a counselor at school you can reach out to?\n\nMy mother was very physically and mentally abusive to me and when I was in elementary school, I would talk to a school counselor and it helped me a lot...just even to talk to someone who would listen. I felt less alone.", "I'm so glad to read this! It appears I've been commenting before reading all of your comments. I apologize for that. \n\nBeing abused and neglected is so awful. I went through it with my mother when I was little. She began beating me and threatening to send me away at a young age, and this was after another member of the family sexually assaulted me. I was in grade 3. The pain of what happened to me still affects me badly. I'm so glad you're talking to someone about this. I wish there was something  more I could suggest but it sounds like you're doing everything in your power to  help yourself. \n\nBe proud of yourself for reaching out and understanding that what your mother is doing is definitely NOT okay.", "Hi OP, I noticed that by the Elton John comment you live in Australia and maybe even my city. \n\nBy depending on you entirely to assist in raising your brothers and take care of the home, your mother is parentifying you. This can be considered a form of child abuse in Australia.\n\nYour mum should not be leaving you alone for long periods of time, especially overnight.  You are 15 and have had to be mature and grow up fast, but in the eyes of the law you are still a child and you deserve to have a regular childhood/teen life. Your brothers are not your children, hence not your responsibility. While everyone needs to help out with chores at home, you are doing significantly more than you should. \n\nDo you have someone to talk to at school about this? A guidence counsellor? \nI highly highly reccommend you talk to someone about this, even if it's just to get the bad feelings off your chest. They cannot report your mum or even talk to her about what you have said without your direct permission as they have to keep confidentiality. You don't have to worry about mum finding out. \n\nYou can also call kids helpline, it's a free number and Telstra telephone booths are now free in Aus if you don't have a mobile phone/don't want mum to know. \nIt's very important that you are being heard and have someone to share your emotions with. \n\nKids Helpline: 1800 55 1800 (free phone call - talk to a trained adult about anything, they give good advice or can even just listen to you rant and offer emotional support) All ages 5-25\n\neHEADSPACE: 1800 650 890 (free call or online chat - if you don't like talking on the phone you can chat online with a trained counsellor.) made for teens 12-25\n\nFRIENDLINE: 1800\u00a0424\u00a0287 (free call- supports anyone who's feeling lonely, needs to vent feelings or just wants a chat) all ages \n\nAll of these services are anonymous, meaning you DO NOT have to give them any information, you don't even have to tell them your name. They cannot tell your mum or get you in trouble.  \n\nYou deserve to be heard and respected. You deserve to share your feelings without being yelled at or punished.", "No.", "NTA. Yeah it looks like this dynamic isn't going to change anytime soon.  You should put your head down, study your ass off, get your extracurriculars in order, get awesome to get a free ride to an ivy league far away from home. \n\nI bet when you turn 18, your mom will start demanding rent and pulling you further into her dysfunction. I'm sorry but you are going to have to sprout the wings to fly away from this.", "NTA Your mom is a trash parent & id tell her that if she doesn\u2019t shape up that the next time she left me alone with those kids , I\u2019d call CPS on her ass. Tell you aunt \u201cALL she\u2019s done is give birth to kids she won\u2019t take care of\u201d.", "NTA. Every parent \u201cowes\u201d their kid care and responsibility. Your mother is providing neither.", "Fuck me love your family are royally fucked. If I were you I'd be calling Child Protection Services to get involved. She's neglecting her youngest children and has parentified you into looking after them while she fucks off with her boyfriend acting like a child. \n\nShe's also abusive to you, as is her sister. You need to make that call, child, really she deserves everything she gets. Calling her own child a bitch. I know how that hurts. I've been called it a lot by my own parents and siblings. \n\nNTA but your mother sure is.", "You're not the asshole but this sounds like a complicated family issue that needs unpacking.\n\nAt the end of the day, she needs to compromise and she shouldn't make you feel like a burden for doing things a mother should do. Parents can be selfish, I just hope she doesn't drive you away forever cause holding shit like your healthcare needs over you head? Unreal.\n\nI used to argue with my mom tonnes as a teen. I've had health issues my whole life and not once have my family made me feel guilty for that. And asking your aunt to chew you out? Wrong. Childish. Unfair.", "NTA but I hope you can get out of there soon. I am sorry your mom is not really being your mom.", "NTA start saving now I wish someone would\u2019ve told me this when I was your age so I would end up stuck do whatever you can to get out of this household once you turn 18 you are these people nothing get a job and start putting shit away don\u2019t even let your mom know you have a job since after school activities", "I am so sorry that you have to step up like this, your siblings will forever cherish you, but you are on the verge of collapsing. Do you have any other trusted adults to talk to? Someone at school, or a relative? You shouldnt carry this burden yourself. NTA", "NTA!! AT ALL!!!\n\nLook up the phrase \"dry drunk\".  And see about getting to some Alateen meetings. Your mom is not okay and it's not okay for her to treat you like she does. (((hugs)))", "NTA\n\nGoogle Parentification. It is abuse and it is exactly what your mother had done to you.\n\nIs there any adult family members you trust? Is there a teacher at school? Because you need to get yourself out of there.", "Are there no social services you can use?\n\nEvery country is different but you might be able to get yourself and siblings into a safer environment.", "I've been through the same with my parents. My dad used to beat me and my mother was verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive. I received no love at all from either parent and after my grandmother died when I was 7 I had no one. I had to pretend everything was OK otherwise my dad would beat me. I know exactly what you're going through. Apart from the parentification as my twin brother and I were the youngest. It's been 20 years since I last saw ANY of them. It hurts still.", "CPS were called. Did nothing.", "How can she possibly do all the chores when she's having to look after her younger siblings? This is a workload that would normal involved a mother and a father. And she's a 15 year old CHILD being expected to do it all! That's ridiculous!\n\nEdit: Grammar", "I understand that\ud83d\ude44 if you would have read my post you would have noticed I pointed that out and that her situation is different. I also stated that she IS raising them and I was proud she called her mother out on her BS...idk if you missed that part or just desided that because I put E.S.H you were gonna have a rant."]}
