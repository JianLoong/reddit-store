{"id": 25721, "submission_id": "163pbrg", "title": "AITA for forbidding my parents from seeing my stepson and wanting to cancel the disney trip?", "selftext": "My husband has a 7-year-old son. I\u2019ve been involved in his son\u2019s life since he was an infant.My husband\u2019s ex-girlfriend left him for another man, and she has only recently started to be involved. We live a completely different lifestyle than her. She\u2019s struggling financially and can\u2019t really give him the same luxuries that we can. My parents especially don\u2019t have a spending limit when it comes to the grandkids. They always go home with something extravagant or they go on fun vacations. The big vacation that will happen this year is in December, my parents and the grandkids are going to Tokyo Disney.\n\nWhen he visits his mother, he often expresses his desire to return home or visit his other grandparents (my parents). He states that the visit isn't as enjoyable and that his mother's family doesn't engage in the same activities as we do with him or my parents. Due to the differing treatment from his mother, her family, and my family, he struggles with his mother's family. She has expressed her desire to bond with him but has mentioned that our involvement may be getting in the way. She has requested that we take a step back to allow him to adjust to her and her family. I of course said yes, because she\u2019s his mom and has the final say.\n\nI had a conversation with my parents about my stepson and suggested that we tone down the gifts and vacations so he can better adjust to his mother and her family. I even proposed canceling the Disney trip so he could spend his first Christmas with his mom. However, my parents became upset and refused, saying that she should have been with him six years ago and that he was used to living this way. I argued that his mother is making an effort to bond with him and we should respect her wishes for the sake of his mental health. Unfortunately, my parents responded by berating me and insulting me. I felt angry and decided to forbid them from seeing my stepson and son.\n\nWhen I arrived home, my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said the same sentiment as my parents, stating that his ex's inability to bond with their son is not our problem. I argued by reminding him that my family and I are just his stepfamily, and now that his biological mother's family wants to bond with him, my parents need to take a step back. He didn't respond and instead took the kids to my parents' house, despite my objections. They returned home after spending the entire weekend there. I attempted to explain to my husband that we should prioritize his son's well-being and respect his ex-girlfriend's wishes, but he was too resentful towards her to listen. He demanded an apology before he would speak to me again.\n\nMy sister says that I\u2019m wrong for what I did and that I should apologize to my husband and my parents, I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m wrong and the only one who cares about his future mental health and the relationship he has with his real family.

Your husband and even your parents are right. His bio mom disappeared from his life for 6 years and now wants to waltz back in and dictate what you and your family do and how you treat the child you've raised as your own while she was off living her life? And somehow you think THEY are the ones who are wrong? She can see him but she doesn't get to decide what you give him or do with him.", "YTA if I was kid looking forward to Disneyland at Christmas only to be told just over 3 months before I go that its been cancelled so I can spend it with my mom who I hardly know I'd be pissed!\n\nAbout your comments that you're just his stepfamily is so hurtful to your husband. Yes his mom is his bio mom but you married his father so YOU are his family. Imagine if your poor stepson heard what you said when he loves you like a bio mom.", "YTA, your husband is right. She wants to be mom without ever having put the effort into actually being mom. If she can't bond with him, it's not the vacations. It's not the gifts. It's because there's a lack of effort and care on her end. Kids don't really care when stuff is fancy unless you teach them to look down on people who have less. She needs to figure out on her own how to make that connection with him, and if he finds out he's being denied things because of her that's going to make it much harder. \n\nGently, you're applying logic that makes sense. If she were gone for a justifiable reason, like being deployed or being very sick, your husband probably would not have had the reaction he did. But she was gone because she chose to abandon him at the time when a kid is the most difficult. She skipped out on potty training and teaching him to behave in public and the food sensitivities so that she can enjoy him when he's cute and impressionable. Based on her track record, there's always the possibility that she'll dip again the second he hits the tween years and develops a real personality. She could dip tomorrow after deciding that it's too hard to actually be a parent and put the effort into getting to know him! \n\nYou also did all of this completely independently of your husband's input, which was, imo, kinda fucked up. I know he's both of yours son, you basically raised him. But you guys are a unit and big decisions like this need to be made TOGETHER. You cannot just decide something this big on your own and tell your spouse it's happening, that's not how adult communication works. That's the real crux of the issue here my guy.", "YTA\n\nYour step son has loving parents and grand parents.  Why should he be denied because bio mom suddenly wants back in the picture?  Is she paying your husband child support?  Back child support?  What does the custody agreement say?", "YTA\n\nYou are aware that how a 7yo will view this is that he's being punished? Yes, you should encourage him to go visit his mother and her parents. But do not forbid him from contact with your parents or take away trips he's already aware are upcoming.\n\nDestroying his relationships and bonds with your parents isn't going to result in him being able to bond with his mother and her parents--it's simply going to traumatize him and make it harder for him to trust or bond with anyone else.", "YTA\n\n So your stepson and your parents are punished because a woman who abandoned her child isn't able to bond with him?? Geez i wonder why. Could it be because she ABANDONED him when he was an infant?? How tf can you think the solution here is to make him lose time with his family, especially his loving grandparents?? \n\n>we should prioritize his son's well-being\n\nBy forcing him to give up his relationship with his grandparents to make happy some people who abandoned him for years?? You constantly prioritize his bio mother's needs, not your stepson's. \n\n>she should have been with him six years ago and that he was used to living this way.\n\n They're right. \n\nWhy do you keep prioritizing a woman who abandoned her kid over the kid's well being??", "I'm sorry but YTA. Your stepson's bio mother can still do things with him that make him happy. He's 7 years old, he'd be happy with a game of football in the park and a pizza. It's not as if your side of the family is taking him to Disney every week, you must be doing \"normal\" activities with him sometimes. It's up to his bio mother to put in a bit more effort to make his visits exciting and with a 7 year old, it's not that difficult.", "YTA.  How does the mother who abandoned him get \"the final say\" rather than the custodial and always-there-for-him father?  In fact, why is she having these conversations with you?  If you are \"just a step\" then take a step back yourself.  Also, pretty cruel to treat your parents like a spigot whose love and involvement can be turned on and off.  And don't assume the kid is merely a little materialist when it comes to how he feels about the difference between the two households.", "YTA. You'll be inflicting more damage onto your stepson when he sees the other grandkids going on trips, getting gifts, etc. and wonder why the sudden change. Yes you are a stepmom but you and your family have been around since he was a infant. His ex hasn't been in his life and it's not your job to facilitate a bond that may never happen.", "YTA- How does taking away things he's excited for in exchange for things he specifically said he does not want make any sense to you?!!", "YTA. It is def not your responsibility to make your stepson love/accept his mom. I will grant you that the excessive gift giving/trips may lead to becoming a bit spoiled, that's an entirely different conversation and has nothing to do with his mom trying to reconnect with him. thats on her to win his trust/love back after being out of the picture for so long and its not fair to him or your family to not enjoy yourselves just because she can't also do all of those things. \n\nNot to mention, cancelling a disney trip that you already had planned will come across as but cruel and unwarranted punishment to a 7 year old and just make him resent his mom more if he finds out that was reason why", "YTA\n\nif you adopted an infant and then seven years later bio mom shows up, would you tell everyone to take a big step back so bio mom can get closer. Your son is not distant from his bio mother because they don't have money. He's distant because he doesn't know who the hell they are.\n\nYour parents have gone above and beyond to pull this child into their life and you're telling them that what they have done is worthless.", "YTA...It's up to his mother to adjust, learn, and find a way forward with her son.  Compromising on the relationships and happiness in his life to make it easier for her, doesn't make much sense.", "YTA\n\nYour parents love this boy. He loves your parents. They are part of his family. I can't imagine how hurt he would be if they abandoned him \"for his own good\". Do you really believe that won't negatively affect his mental health?\n\n Are you telling us that stepparents or step-grandparents are just a poor substitute for biological family? A emotional prosthesis that you can throw away when \"real\" limb starts working? \n\nYou can't force a bond just because ex-GF is his birth mother. On the contrary, you'll probably harm their relationship. Your stepson isn't a toddler. He will know that he lost people he loves and various pleasures - because of his \"mother\". And you, of course.", "YWBTA, unfortunately, should you do this. Your parents aren't the problem here. (Lots of us had a favorite grandparent - and the relationship had nothing to do with affluence, or gifts.)  The child's biological mother fell off the map and has returned. That's the problem. They won't have a similar closeness and you can't force a greater bond because her leaving him will never be erased. All that you can do is work with her so that your son has a healthy and balanced relationship with her.\n\nBut, to attempt to create that balance by denying him the love and support, affection and presence of people who have always been there for him is not the way to achieve that. (It will create more confusion for him and increase his disinterest in his bio mom if he feels he has to give up everything else because of her.) \n\nAgain, we can't undue past absences. And we can't make up for what someone else just doesn't have or doesn't know how to be. All we can do is offer equal time and lots of patience.", "YTA. Your husband and parents are correct. \n\nShe\u2019s seven years late in being his mother, she\u2019s just the egg donor. One that only decided to show interest when the kid reached an age where they don\u2019t require near constant attention and all those messy things like potty training and learning to eat and such are out of the way. \n\nNot only that, but she\u2019s so selfish that she\u2019ll happily deprive the kid of opportunities and gifts so she can seem cooler either having to invest in the kid. \n\nBut I guess I can see that you do not consider him yours at all, a real mother would 100% put her kid above anyone, especially a person who didn\u2019t give a fig for years.", "YTA. \n\nSo here is where I'm confused.  You want to throw out \"we are only the step family\" one minute, but then when he wants to decide what is best for his son, then you think you should be able to make that decision. \n\nYour parents love this kid, and he seems to love them back.  But you want to punish the people who have treated him well for years, and punish him, just because the mom is now making an effort?", "You keep mentioning that his bio mother is his real family - you helped raise this kid more then his bio mother did, you\u2019re his family. YOU\u2019RE his mother as well as she is. \n\nWhilst I think you\u2019re absolutely right to help foster the relationship between your stepson and his bio mother, you\u2019re essentially forcing this on him. You can\u2019t keep saying you\u2019re doing this for his mental health and then actively ignoring him when he says he wants to come home. \n\nAnd actually, if you\u2019re really wanting to go by what his biological parents says, his dad has the final word. If his father is saying that you\u2019re in the wrong, then you\u2019re in the wrong by your own understanding. \n\nIf you\u2019re not careful, it\u2019s going to look like you just want to stop playing the role of mother now that his bio mum is back. \n\nHonestly, I think your intentions are good but you\u2019re just steamrolling your stepsons feelings and your husbands parental responsibility. Your own parents love this kid and are quite rightly concerned about all these big changes you\u2019re making, and again these decisions seem to be made on your own without discussing anything with your husband. \n\nYTA and I hope that you take the time to listen to your stepson, husband and parents before making any more decisions.", "Family is what\u2019s in a persons heart and I hate to say this but her heart wasn\u2019t there six years ago.  Ytah let his dad decide what\u2019s best for his sons", "YTA, kids get spoiled by grandparents all the time. When I grew up we had one side of the family that was better off than the other, we got better presents and had more fun things to do. When we went to the other grandparents, we still had fun, games and good food, just different kinds. Life is not vanilla, kids need to learn that not everyone has the same things, this is his chance to learn and grow. There is no reason take away his FAMILY vacation, sounds like it was planned and I am sure they are getting excited about it.", "INFO:  Did your husband sever the ex-girlfriend's parental rights? If not, why not? If yes, did you adopt this child? Why would you force a 7yo kid to build a relationship with a complete stranger, unless it's court-ordered (and I doubt a court would order it)?  Why are you and your parents running the show here in all this?\n\nIt's bizarre that you are worried about the relationship this kid has with what **you** consider \"his real family.\" This whole post sounds like bad fiction.", "YTA", "YTA. Of course you mean well, but you can\u2019t make decisions like this unilaterally. Also, it\u2019s not the gifts and trips alone that make up your son\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t want to leave everything he knows to go spend time with people he doesn\u2019t know AND in reduced conditions. It\u2019s hard for him and it will take time. His bio mom is trying her best, but she\u2019s been gone for years. She\u2019s blaming the difficulty on something outside of her control when staying around all those years ago was under her control.", "YTA. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re trying to do right by his mom and it\u2019s great that she wants to be involved in his life. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think this is the right way to go about. Have you talked to him? To me, it doesn\u2019t sound right that a 7 year old is judging bonding time based on what they can financially give him. Kids that young don\u2019t really think that way in my experience. \n\nAsk your stepson what\u2019s actually going ok. And defer to his dad on how it should be handled. Don\u2019t take his grandparents away from him. Don\u2019t take Disney away from him. \n\nYou don\u2019t give kids love by taking people that love them away from them.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s really unhelpful to call his mom his \u201creal\u201d family. You are all his real family. Look into some resources on blended families.", "YTA especially if your step son already knows about the Disney trip. Stepsons mom can still bond with him even if he goes on trips with your family. Even in a bio family situation these things can come up. If you cancel the trip your step son might feel like he could have been on a trip to but instead he's somewhere he doesn't enjoy being.\n\nHis bio mom can still spend time with him before and after the trip. Why punish your stepdom because his bio mom and her family decided they want to be there today?", "YTA you don't priorize anyone but babymom. You say he is your son and he sees you as his mom and don't want to got to His birthmom. He doesn't want to bond because He knows she abondend him and didn't want him.\n\nIf you really want whats best for your son, the fucking listen to him! He says He Loves you and your Family and doesn't want to stay with His birthmom", "YTA. But at least you don\u2019t need to buy a doormat", "Well you\u2019re coming from a good place, but think of how the child will feel.  In the end it will always be about the child.  She has no right to dictate how you guys do things at your house.  \n\nThe bond between them is strained because of what she did, not because of the things you do at your house even if it seems that way.  He is just simply more comfortable at home and expresses it as \u201cboring\u201d.   She caused what is called a \u201ctrauma bond\u201d and now will have to work extremely hard to get back what she threw away in the beginning.", "It's great that you have compassion for this woman. That's a nice thing, BUT the fact is she abandoned her child for six years. That she can't bond with him has absolutely nothing to do with money and everything to do with the fact that she couldn't be bothered to care about her child in the first place. You shouldn't be punishing the family that love and accept a child that is absolutely no relation to them because the one person who should couldn't be bothered until now. YTA for punishing your family for actually wanting this child.", "Soft YTA- I think your motives here are your step son and that\u2019s admirable, but I think your moves are misguided. \n\nYou\u2019ve said his bio family is your step sons \u201creal family\u201d, would you really say this to his face? Do you recognize you are also telling him he is not your real family, never has been and never will be? This would be so painful for a young child who knows you as his mom, to be told you don\u2019t see him as your real child. \n\nMy eldest child\u2019s bio dad was in and out of the picture and that is so harmful to kids. What\u2019s to say his \u201creal mom\u201d won\u2019t just walk away again? You need to support your step sons choices on if he wants to spend time with his other family or not.

You\u2019re arguments, not to say they\u2019re aren\u2019t valid, just aren\u2019t as strong as theirs.", "ESH except for the child. You were acting in good faith out of empathy for the mother of the child, that's admirable. \n\nBut, you made a decision about the child's parenting without consulting his other parent. This should have been a discussion with your husband where you came to a mutual understanding about how to move forward navigating the relationship with the child's mother.\n\nIt doesn't sound reasonable to ask your parents to cancel a trip that they are looking forward to with their grandchild. A child that they have loved and cared for while the mother was off doing whatever she was doing.", "I think ESH.\n\nI get that his mother wants to be able to have a relationship with her son without it being based on money and expensive activities.\n\nI get that you're trying to make sure that the kid has a relationship with his mother.\n\nI understand that your husband doesn't want to punish his kids because his ex doesn't have money.\n\nI get that your parents want to offer great things to their grandkids.\n\nBut this is not going to end well.\n\nClearly, there are two clans here and the fact that your husband took both kid to your parents for the week-end means, to me, that there a lot more issues in your marriage that this issue.", "ESH. Look, I get that your intentions are good but you're also making a lot of decisions by yourself. Did you even consult with your husband before going to your parents? Have you talked to your stepson to see how he really feels about the whole situation? And why do you assume that forcing him to bond with a person who abandoned him for 7 years is automatically a good thing? Just kinda comes across like you're one of those people who says things like \"nothing is stronger than a mother's love\" despite her obviously doing a lot wrong by her own kid.\n\nHusband and parents slightly suck because of their inability to have an adult conversation about this but I also see their point. Bio mom left your husband and kid for another man. At one point in her life, she decided getting some dick was more important than her kid. If I were him, I'd feel a certain way about her too and would also be annoyed that my now wife is saying I should make accommodations for that same woman who left me to take care of our kid alone.", "There is so much wrong here all around ESH but what you need more than reddit is family counseling. \n\nThis kid needs everyone on the same page and no in fighting over him. Find a way to get there.", "ESH. Mom made her bed and now has to lie in it, you shouldn't \"punish\" your stepson, your spouse and you need to work as a team, and your parents suck for turning literally every interaction into a no-spending limit extravagance.

I wouldn't want my parents to spoil my bio kid like this \n.", "NTA. \n\n>He states that the visit isn't as enjoyable and that his mother's family doesn't engage in the same activities as we do with him or my parents.\n\nThis sticks out to me the most. I'm afraid your stepson is learning the only way to have fun involves money and extravagances.\n\nObviously, your folks' agenda is to spoil their grandkid, it's just what a lot of grandparents do. But I think your husband is feeling a bit spiteful and struggles to see his ex in a positive light or that she's trying. So he's unwilling to give her room to do better. \"You made your bed now lay in it\" simply isn't an appropriate response here... we're talking about a child. \n\nWe all make mistakes, big and small. But I think your husband is setting the example of buying someone's love or favor and seems willing to die on the hill without realizing the long-lasting impact it could have on the kid.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to give a kid experiences, but there's also nothing wrong with wanting to make sure they have a balanced upbringing. If the ex is trying to get her act together and things have come into perspective for her ushering her to prioritize different things as she grows up, why not give her a fair shake if she proves amiable?", "I'll go against the grain and say NTA. You're being very supportive of the relationship between your stepson and his mom. Nobody needs a trip to Tokyo Disney, for God's sake. It sounds like you're afraid he's getting spoiled by all the goodies and not able to see the benefits of a less wealthy family, and that's a valid concern.", "You are one extremely empathetic person and have such a huge grip on reality and everyone's mental health.

We live a completely different lifestyle than her. She\u2019s struggling financially and can\u2019t really give him the same luxuries that we can.

He states that the visit isn't as enjoyable and that his mother's family doesn't engage in the same activities as we do with him or my parents. Due to the differing treatment from his mother, her family, and my family, he struggles with his mother's family. She has expressed her desire to bond with him but has mentioned that our involvement may be getting in the way. She has requested that we take a step back to allow him to adjust to her and her family. I of course said yes, because she\u2019s his mom and has the final say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a conversation with my parents about my stepson and suggested that we tone down the gifts and vacations so he can better adjust to his mother and her family. I even proposed canceling the Disney trip so he could spend his first Christmas with his mom. However, my parents became upset and refused, saying that she should have been with him six years ago and that he was used to living this way. I argued that his mother is making an effort to bond with him and we should respect her wishes for the sake of his mental health. Unfortunately, my parents responded by berating me and insulting me. I felt angry and decided to forbid them from seeing my stepson and son.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I arrived home, my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said the same sentiment as my parents, stating that his ex's inability to bond with their son is not our problem. I argued by reminding him that my family and I are just his stepfamily, and now that his biological mother's family wants to bond with him, my parents need to take a step back. He didn't respond and instead took the kids to my parents' house, despite my objections. They returned home after spending the entire weekend there. I attempted to explain to my husband that we should prioritize his son's well-being and respect his ex-girlfriend's wishes, but he was too resentful towards her to listen. He demanded an apology before he would speak to me again.  \n\n\n  \nMy sister says that I\u2019m wrong for what I did and that I should apologize to my husband and my parents, I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m wrong and the only one who cares about his future mental health and the relationship he has with his real family.

Not true if you cared you would be working with a therapist to introduce a 7 year old to his mother,I who abandoned and threw him away, in a non traumatic way.  You are forcing a relationship with a woman he doesn\u2019t know and removing a close relationship with people he loves.  \n\nThis is a decision for his father not you. You are not omnipotent, the I\u2019m right and everyone else is wrong is a horrible way to think.  Stop forcing the relationship, it could take years to create a loving bond.  The biological mother at this point shouldn\u2019t really have any rights, 7 years in a long time to have nothing to do with a child.  Plus is she planning on sticking around?  What if in 3 months she decides it\u2019s not worth working for a relationship, or she gets pregnant and says the hell with the 7 year old?

It's not like you're suggesting putting your stepchild in a situation of poverty or lack. What you're doing, and rightfully so, is adjusting the child's expectations. Children can be very materialistic - not in a malicious way, but in the sense that it's very easy to buy a child's affection with flashy gifts. They grow accustomed to doing and receiving specific things, and when this treatment is constant they tend not to like to be in a different environment, receiving a different treatment. You didn't say \"let's stop giving the child presents\", you said \"let's allow his other family to also contribute with love and affection and not overshadow them with gifts they could never compete with, since they don't have enough money to\". Yes, the mother made several mistakes. She cheated and abandoned her child. That must've been very traumatic and it's going to take time for her to gain her child's and your family's trust. But now she wants to repent and prove to her child that she loves him. You seem to be the only forgiving person here. Just the fact that your husband and parents had to insult you and yell at you to assert their opinion in this matter is very telling, and I suspect your family enjoys holding this financial power over the mother, who they feel deserves punishment for what she did - they can't stop her from coming back for her child, but they can make it harder for him to love her. Unless the child already knew about the trip and was very excited to go only to have his plans be changed to spending Christmas with his mom's family, with whom he's not very comfortable, I'd say the compromise you're suggesting is very reasonable.

You asked for judgement and it has been given.", "You are his \u201creal\u201d family. You were there for him when he learned to walk, lost his first tooth, had his first day of school, etc.\n\nThat woman who just turned up and now thinks she can dictate how you and your husband and your parents treat your son is his egg donor.\n\nAlso, your husband is his father, his \u201creal\u201d father, so why are you ignoring what he wants? If you are *just* the stepmother, why not defer to the biological parent who stuck around to raise the child and bond with the child day in and day out? Why are you so quick to listen to someone who doesn\u2019t even know this child just because she happens to share some DNA with him?", "You and your parents are his real family at least to him and your parents.   Apparently you are now ready to throw him to the wolves now that his egg donor has made an appearance. \n\nTo him you are his mom and if you weren't ready to accept that and continue to accept that then you should not have gotten involved with a single father with an infant son and taken on that role and integrated him into your parents life.\n\nThe bio grandparents could have been a part of his life this whole time but only just chose to make an appearance when the egg donor did.  They cannot dictate the sons life when they never cared enough to even show up before.\n\nYta.   Continue to act this way and be prepared to lose your husband,  stepson,  your parents and however much custody time from bio son because they will at the end of the day protect the boy and leave you behind if you continue to think your attitude and actions are ok because they are not", "So his father isn't his \"real family\"?  Why are his absent mom's feelings are more valid than the feelings of his very present father's?  \n\nI don't know how you ended up so much more self absorbed than your parents and your sister.", "By saying \"real family,\" you DO consider him an outsider.\nYou never considered asking about his feelings and are just pushing some weird righteous agenda on everyone. \n\nHow would your husband respond to your \"real family\" comment? \nI bet he would be shocked and tell you to start packing.", "Have you considered that he might think you\u2019ve pushed him away so you can focus on your \u201creal\u201d family?", "But all you can do is love him. Your parents love him as a bio-gc, why can't you see that. Love him and support him. Talk to him. Express that bio-mom is doing her best. But don't you dare do your worst.", "I get it... and people, who will try to tell you, that kids care about who was there for them, are not right (unfortunately) - many kids want to bond with their bio-parent because they are curious and wonder, so don't let anyone belittle your fears, because they are valid!\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I don't think you should give into that fear, because it will destroy you, your relationship with your family and even the one with your husband and son - instead just talk with your husband, explain to him that while you love that boy so much, you are just afraid of losing him in future to his mother and figure that together... \r  \n\r  \nSometimes it's hard to give advices, because details we don't know do matter - everything depends on your son and if he even wants to see his bio-mom, if bio-mom could sue for some kind of custody and win (even in future) and so much more... so the best advise you can get here right now, is **talk with your husband, maybe even lawyer and just be team with your husband**, because bio-mom is going to be always there (even if she is not activily in your son's life) and you willl need people around you to get throught it, because in this case you have most to lose.", "This is so sad. My heart breaks for this boy. I dearly hope you don\u2019t actually think of him as not your \u201creal\u201d son after seven years of being the only mother figure he\u2019s known.\n\nYou giving your son less or won\u2019t make him love her more. Kids don\u2019t have a \u201cmum slot\u201d where only one person who loves them counts. Your relationship with him has nothing to do with his relationship with her.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s going to be confused about why you\u2019ve suddenly pulled back, cancelled things he has looked forward to and cut off access to his grandparents. He will wonder if he\u2019s being punished or rejected. If your other siblings are treated differently, he\u2019ll start to put together the dots of not being a \u201creal\u201d son or grandson.\n\nI do understand your fears here, but it\u2019s been seven years. It\u2019s not going to be an overnight process for her to feel like a mum to him. She\u2019s hurt him. She has to do the work to fix that. There\u2019s no shortcut.\n\nYou\u2019re letting him have a relationship with his mum on her time. You\u2019re working with her to make sure she gets some custody or visitation. If you\u2019re not disparaging her and you\u2019re helping him work through his feelings towards her, that\u2019s the work. But you should be \n\nYour thinking here is very \u201call-or-nothing\u201d. You\u2019re jumping to extremes. Assuming that you do love your stepson, I wonder if they come partly with a fear of being rejected or replaced yourself. Are you self-sabotaging so you don\u2019t feel hurt if he does build a connection with his mother? Are you trying to reject him before he somehow rejects you? Because that\u2019s not fair to your stepson, and it\u2019s not fair to you. If you go through with this and you lose him, that will be your fault. It will have nothing to do with his mother.\n\nYou\u2019ve all always been a source of love and stability in his life. Taking away that love and stability won\u2019t make his mother seem like a more loving and stable option. It\u2019ll just remove that love and stability, leaving a seven year old  feeling abandoned and trying to figure out why things have suddenly changed.", "You arent. She is. Shes put him on the back burner his whole life. Even now, shes putting herself and her desires and her terms on \"bonding\" before him. The bonding NEEDS to be on HIS TERMS. She isnt the victim here and you are enabling her bad behaviour over your stepson's happiness. She's not making an effort. She's STILL putting herself first.", "u/concernedmom489\n\n\nHere's a crazy idea, have tried talking to your stepson? How about any kind of professional, like a therapist who deal with kids and estranged parents situations? Or is it all shoot from the hip cause of your fears?\n\n\nAlso, this kid doesn't really know this woman, she was gone for the vast majority of his life. Don't you think his discomfort stems from that, and you guys forcing him to spend time there? It sou ds like she's been around, what, a year? These should all be supervised visits until he's comfortable", "Well you see how that worked out for her, she better get her head out of her as before she is single!", "\ud83c\udfc5", "Yeah, I saw that comment about \"his real family\" at the end, she does not consider him to be fully a part of her family.", "I hadn't thought of this, but OP sure is eager to back off, isn't she?  To the point of arguing with her husband and family to do so.", "Wow exactly my thought", ">we should respect her wishes for the sake of his mental health.\n\nSorry kid, for the sake of your 'mental health' we're going to take away the grandparents that you've known and loved for your whole life as well as any toys, trips, or goodies they might usually provide so that you can spend time with your 'real' family. \n\nIf the kid's mental health was her primary concern, she would be doing everything she could to keep things as stable to his usual environment and routines as possible while still allowing time for him to adjust to his bio mom and her family. Instead her approach ends up punishing him for his mom coming back into his life.", "\ud83c\udfc5", "Exactly! I hope her husband comes across this post and the \u201creal family\u201d part jumps out at him.", "Maybe because she knows if they divorced, she has zero rights to her stepson as do her parents.  Until his bio mom gives up her parental rights and allows OP to adopt him, she\u2019s right. She\u2019s not next of kin and if something happens to her husband, her step son will go live with his bio mother (unless again, she agreed to OP adopting her son)", "but what you WILL do if you persist is exactly that - that he's not worth the \"expense\" and attention your family gives him.  He'll come to resent his bio-mom's family for taking that away from him - and you for causing it.  Bio-mom's family can show him love without spending $.  In the end, it's your stepson that will suffer.  Yikes.  Not sure how you don't see that.", "So why cut him off from his grandparents who love him? Or make him miss out on a trip to Disney?", "No one believes you. Your other words and actions tell a completely different story than this comment here.", "So your other option is to push away the family that IS there for him? He can have it all. Why are you trying to cut out family that wants to be there?", "And your solution is to cut him off from the family that has been there for him??? How do you not see how insane that is? That is why people are calling you out, because your \"solution\" makes zero sense.", "Did he know you were not his bio mom before this and has he been in therapy did you check with his therapist at all? Honestly with all the posts about grandparents treating at p kids or adopted kids as less or not real family your parents are doing a great job as grandparents and you need to consider your son's feelings.", "stopping him from doing fun stuff with your family is not going to make him bond with hers. what will you say when he asks why the Disney trips have stopped? because if you tell the truth, which is that his birth mother asked for them to stop so she seems less crap in comparison, it'll just make him resent her more. or are you going to lie to him? and ask everyone else in the family to lie to him?", "Nah, you just want him gone.", "As a kid who was kept from their biological dad growing up I think your feelings are COMPLETELY valid.", "Not always, especially with her being in the childs life and the bio mom abandoning him!", ">Maybe because she knows if they divorced, she has zero rights to her stepson as do her parents.\n\nThat may be true, but based on her husband's actions, do you really think he would cut him off from the only grandparents he's ever really known in the event of a divorce?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She\u2019s not next of kin and if something happens to her husband, her step son will go live with his bio mother (unless again, she agreed to OP adopting her son)\n\nBut that isn't the argument she's making, is it?  You are going into contortions to add justifications to OP's very, very weak arguments.  Just saying."]}
