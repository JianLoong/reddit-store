My husband and I have 3 kids (5yo twin boys, 2yo daughter) and I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant. We gave this woman her own room (moved our boys in to the same bedroom for the time being). The only issue is that we only have 1 bathroom and she will literally be in there for no less than 45 minutes every single time she uses it and she never tells anyone she will be using it before going in, so no one can plan according to her bathroom routine. \n\nI brought it up with her yesterday because I'm honestly getting so tired of needing to use the restroom at 28 weeks pregnant and having to wait around for an hour sometimes to actually be able to go. Like, I'm becoming super mean and irritable because this always happens. I brought it up with her following me getting up at 2am and her being in the bathroom getting ready for work. I sat at the table and waited until almost 3:15 before she came out and that was after I knocked on the door at 2:40 to tell her to hurry up because I was going to piss my pants. \n\nSo anyways, I talked to her about it yesterday and she told me that the reason she takes so long is because she takes her meds in there because there's a counter top and more space. See, she just had gender affirming surgery so she takes shots for estrogen boosters, testosterone blockers and she still needs to.. stretch? As like.. the follow up from the surgery. And I guess she just does all of it in the bathroom instead of her bedroom. I told her she needs to not do that in my bathroom at all and keep it in her room because she is heavily inconveniencing us (me especially because I can't hold it too well being pregnant). She's upset with me because this \"has always been her routine\" and she doesn't feel comfortable doing this in her bedroom due to lack of space and counter top areas to put out everything she needs.

You\u2019re doing her a favour and you\u2019ve given her your room. Of course it\u2019s not unreasonable to want to access your own bathroom! 45 minutes every time not telling anyone is really inconsiderate, if things don\u2019t improve you might have to tell her it isn\u2019t working and she\u2019ll have to find somewhere else, does she pay you rent?", "NTA. She needs to adapt her routine to yours, and not the other way around.", "NTA  \n\n\nHolding your bladder can cause health problems.

You\u2019ve about to add a 4th little human to the house, maybe it\u2019s time to give your new roommate a reasonable and nice notice to find other living space.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nI grew up in a small 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom ranch house with 2 parents and 2 siblings. We always asked each other if anyone had to go before we showered. Most of us were quick, but my sister would be in there forever to shower - so it was Especially important that she ask! \n\nEven in my house when it was just me and my SO - we ask if the other needed the bathroom first. \n\n5 year olds are likely potty trained, but not neccessarily able to hold it forever either. \n\nYou are doing a huge favor. Their routine was disrupted by not having a place to go, so the fact they have a place is reducing their disruption tremendously and it seems common courtesy to respect the people who you live with, and even moreso to respect the people who are helping you out and giving you a place to live. \n\nI understand they might need access to a sink for some of the shots - but maybe they quickly wahs their hands before the shots in the bathroom and then go back and do it in the room. I am sure they can find a cheap piece of furniture/table they can use for the meds", "NTA\n\nYou're doing her a huge favor by letting her stay with you and even went as far as to rearrange how your children sleep just to give her a room to herself. So, it's okay for her to make you guys change up YOUR routine, but not okay for you to change up HER routine? What you're asking is super reasonable. Her tying up the bathroom for up to an hour at a time, blocking everyone from using it, is not reasonable.", "NTA. She inconveniencing everyone in the household.

But hopefully not if she's already working again\n\nI don't think you'd be AH for telling her to change that routine, and I do think she needs to be more respectful that you're pregnant and will NEED the bathroom urgently and without warning sometimes, but I definitely get why it would make her uncomfortable", "YTA  you were an AH to your boys.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can\u2019t occupy it for anything other than what\u2019s necessary.\n\nThe appropriate response is to make sure she has a lock on the door and a table of some kind in her room. You might need to move some furniture out or put it in storage so she can have a small card table in there.", "NTA if she needs counter space she can get an extra table (those fold ones are usually pretty cheap) or something to create that extra counter space in the room.", "It's inconvenient for your friend to do her medical routine in the bedroom, but it's inconvenient for everyone else to be denied the bathroom.

Tell her your \"routine\" is being able to use the bathroom in YOUR house as needed and if she can't work with that then she can find another place to live.  You are incredibly generous to allow her to live there.  You moved your kid out of his room and there is only one bathroom which has to be shared.  She's being difficult and ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nI honestly can't imagine wanting to dilate (what you referred to as 'stretching') in a bathroom. You basically take a medically approved dildo and hold it in yourself for 30m or so. It's not particularly fun, and doing it in a bathroom has to suck. \n\nI can understand wanting to do estrogen injections in a bathroom since it's easier to be sterile, have access to a sink for washing hands, etc. However, those happen once a week, and shouldn't take longer than like 10 minutes to do (or once every two weeks depending on the dosages). If she's telling you she does injections every day, she's lying to you.\n\nIt is absolutely reasonable to ask her to dilate in her bedroom. You're a goddamn saint for letting her pay a pittance in rent when her insurance is fucking her over, and you can accomplish dilating with no more space than a small nightstand and some toilet paper.", "Even if OP wasn\u2019t pregnant. You are rude as hell if you occupy the only restroom for an excessive amount of time in a shared living situation. Especially if they aren\u2019t for actually bathroom exclusive reasons.", "She pays $150 a month. The reason why she needed somewhere to stay was because her surgery cost a lot and her medications aren't covered by insurance. So her shots alone cost on the ups of $2400 a month. So we are only charging her $150 so she can have access to the meds she needs without having to worry about it.", "It\u2019s definitely for privacy and hygienic reasons\u2026 as soon as I read that she needs to \u201cstretch\u201d I reaaaally hope she\u2019s cleaning that bathroom", "Wow you really are doing her a massive favour, basically she wouldn\u2019t find anywhere else to live for so little then wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the medication. Understandable you want to help and support her. She just sounds a bit selfish and inconsiderate really, she clearly needs you so it\u2019s odd to be upset with you when you could just tell her to move out.", "it sounds like she\u2019s living about her means , i understand completely why she wanted the surgery and that she NEEDS her shots , but she obviously can\u2019t afford everything she\u2019s trying to do. 150 a month is SOOOO cheap, she can atleast not take up to an hour in the bathroom especially since you have a problem with it . nta", "Easier than cleaning the bed \ud83d\ude05"]}
