You don\u2019t want me around your kid? Why should I send a gift?", "NTA. Your wife needs a reality check. She can't expect your mom to play finance grandma while restricting her from being an actual grandma. Your wife set the boundaries and now is mad about it. \n\nThat being said, you are also the AH for going along with your wife's plan. Your wife doesn't like their humor? Oh well. I am sure there are things you don't like about her family. Would it be okay for you to decide that your child can't be around them?", "NTA. Your wife doesn't want your mom in your lives in any meaningful way, but she expects your mom to contribute to your lives in a materialistic way? You are correct, that is absolutely entitled. She wants her presents but not her presence. Geeze.", "Question OP:\nIs it your (yours and your wife) baby or only her? How can she decide that the baby won\u2019t see your family? Are you ok with this? Do you have any opinions by yourself or wife thinks for you?\n\nIt seems you are NTA in this situation, but with this approach you will need a lot of luck!", "NTA.\n\nBut I am really feeling puzzled here as to why you accepted this level of contact in the first place if it is just that your wife doesn't like their humour unless you have left out that your family is actively cruel and rude to your wife and does it to her all the time against her wishes/breaks a lot of other boundaries.\n\nYour wife sounds like she just wants her way and you aren't really being allowed your own opinion. \n\nAnd like, it is absolutely entitled to expect gifts for your child while not letting that person see them. Gifts shouldn't buy a relationship obviously, but you also don't tend to give them if there isn't one as they are part of building a relationship.", "NTA and you are going to regret having a child with someone like your wife, and so will your child.", "NTA. You are spot on.", "NTA. She *is* being entitled. I personally wouldn\u2019t expect money or support from someone I\u2019ve explicitly cut out of my life. She cut your mom out of the baby\u2019s life\u2026she should not expect anything.", "NTA, you explained yourself perfectly to her and to us. Strange of your wife to expect a gift to her baby from people who are not going to be allowed to see her baby.", "NTA...this time. I mean wow! You let your wife cut your mom/family out of your life *and* your baby's life because they're sarcastic? Your wife is manipulative, a shit-stirrer, or both. Is there any good reason to cut these people out of your lives? Do you actually think this is enough reason to cut them out of your lives? It doesn't seem like you do.", "INFO is sarcastic worse than judging others?", "INFO: if she hadn't invited your mother, would you be mad your mother was excluded? Would your mother be trashing your wife to all and sundry?", "NTA.", "This can't be real? \n\nIf this is, you're NTA for defending your Mom here.\n\nYou and your wife told her she'll have no relationship with the baby (her grandchild). I can't imagine she handled that well. Of course she's not going to go to the baby shower, or even give a gift. \n\nI get that some family can be problematic, toxic, offensive, bad influences, etc and we may want to limit our exposure, limit the relationship a bit - but to completely cut her out of your child's life, before even being born or seeing how she is around the grandchild or giving her a chance to follow set boundaries is brutal AF. Maybe there is more to the relationship or your Mom is more problematic than what I gather from this post, but it seems both you and your wife are AH here. But you are absolutely right / NTA to defend your Mom not giving  a gift as your wife seems to be the absolute biggest snub of all.", "NTA and you have perfectly articulated why.\n(And your wife needs to pull the stick out of her butt)", "NTA - while I completely respect your wife's decision to not want a baby/child around that sort of humour, it is very weird to want her to come to the baby shower, so yeah I agree with you on that one", "NTA your wife is entitled. That is not right. So let me get this right. She insults her mil then wants her to come so she gets a gift. Nope. She needs to get over herself. She is selfish but wants the gifts. Sorry but all I hear is me me me. Good luck.", "Your wife was furious with your mother and then she blew up at you to the point of kicking you out of your own room.\n\nYour wife has anger issues and I am concerned for the effect this will have on a child. Please protect your child\u2018s emotions from your wife\u2019s irrational, explosive anger.   \n\n\nNTA on the current subject, but you could end up being one based on how much of this shit your child ends up exposed to", "NTA. But I\u2019m missing something. Honestly do not see what the problem is with your family. Your family has compromised. Your wife made your family behavior the hill to die on then she needs to accept the consequences that come with this. My brother second wife doesn\u2019t like how my family communicates. We are loud, my mother uses bitch like it\u2019s an adjective, sometimes she uses it as verb & on rare occasions it\u2019s noun. This bothers my sister in law, my tries really hard not to do it around my sister in law. When I was kid, I wasn\u2019t allowed to call my brother stupid so found new ways to call him stupid without using the word. Use to call him box of rocks all the time, now refer to him as dust. I still tell him he has two brain cells that are fighting distance third. His wife finds this mean, I just don\u2019t do it around her. I just don\u2019t get why the compromise wasn\u2019t good enough for your wife.", "Info. Did your wife tell your mother she didn\u2019t want her around the baby or did you tell your mother ?", "I'm surprised to be saying this based on the title, but after reading the whole thing...\n\nYou're absolutely **NTA** and entirely correct. \n\nYour wife wants to have her cake and eat it, too. She's being tacky and inappropriate, and she has no right to be angry here. In fact, she should probably sit with the fact that she's behaving an awful lot like the in-laws she finds so offensive: she has been hurtful to them (if understandably so and with good reason) by informing them that she does not want them to have a relationship with your soon-to-be-born child, and then turned around and expected them to behave as if their feelings aren't hurt. That's not how things work. \n\nTo be clear, I absolutely support the decision to be low contact with your side of the family. While I have a dark sense of humour, there is a very specific difference between dark, wry humour and sarcasm specifically, which you've touched upon - a difference that a lot of people seem to miss, which is that sarcasm is INHERENTLY MALICIOUS. By definition, sarcasm involves deliberately mocking people . . . it is inherently contemptuous and malicious, and it isn't just wry or dark, it's innately cruel. Your family are within their rights to refuse to change, but there's no reason in the world why anyone should HAVE to be around people whose rallying cry is, \"I choose to be cruel to those around me for fun, and I have no interest in changing\". I wouldn't want my kids around people like that either. Hell, my parents taught me that people who think sarcasm is the height of humour aren't generally people I should trust in ANY sort of relationship, because they are people who put their amusement above the feelings of others.\n\nBut having said that, now that your wife has made that choice, she cannot expect the people she has pointedly excluded from her life to want to be a part of celebrating her or her child. Why should they? Nope. You are NTA, and your wife needs to be more realistic.", "ESH, it\u2019s hard to tell but it seems awful that yr wife has decided to exclude your family from their grandchild and bizarre that you accept it. I can\u2019t tell if yr family really is bad, but it\u2019s unclear. It\u2019s also probably not great that yr mom isn\u2019t going as she should try to patch things up for her grandchild\u2019s sake. Really this sounds like a huge mess.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Your read on your wife is correct.", "Also the family already seemed to have been willing to compromise by saying they would not do any of this humor in front of both mother and child. So neither the wife, not the baby, would be subjected to the unwanted behavior, but the wife wants to ban the whole family anyhow because of something they do in the privacy of their own home.\n\nSo some of them are having strange rituals - so what? Would OPs wife ban people if she didn't like them wearing latex in bed, or being into death metal? Where does she draw the line?\n\nIf OPs family is otherwise nice and doesn't cause any harm, I think OP is totally the AH for accepting they are shut out of his and his child's life. This baby is as much his as it is his wive's, but he is accepting that she alienates both of them from their family. I would never ever accept a behavior and wish like that.", "This!

They deserve each other.", "We told her together", "I grew up in a family full of jokesters and lots of sarcasm. My kids were raised around it and there kids will be. As were my nieces, nephews, cousins and even my godchildren. In the end, we are all okay. A little sarcastic but okay lol. OP's wife seems to be stuck on the idea that all family interactions must fit her standards or must be like those she knows. I question why she even bothered to marry her husband when she shows this level of disdain.", "I read the OP's account as his family agreed they wouldn't do it 'to' his wife and child, so yes they would be exposed to the insults, insults just would not be directed at them. A family culture where harsh insults are considered funny would be hard to accept if you grew up in a kinder gentler family. I don't really blame the wife for being really uncomfortable with it. I do think it's a-holish for the wife to tell his mother she won't see her grandkids and then expect her to come to the shower and buy a gift. That's kinda ridiculous.", "NTA. It's okay to decide that you don't want your baby around toxic, mean people, but it's weird to invite them to the baby shower unless you know they're going to be awful if they don't receive an invite, and it's even weirder to be mad that they didn't come.", "Dude what the fuck.  You actively cosigned this?", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is pretty greedy though. Sheesh. You can\u2019t see the baby, but give me gifts. I would really recommend you seek counselling with her before your child comes. And maybe check what reddit forums she frequents.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think.  You were totally right for how you dealt with your wife.  YTA for letting your wife decide unilaterally who your child can spend time with.

Not wanting your own mother see your baby because she is sarcastic is one of the dumbest reason I ever heard and you accept it?! And your dear wife have the audacity to be pissed because your mom refuse to come to the baby shower of the child she will not be allowed to know but must give money ?!

They will probably expose her dumbness !", "NTA, if she doesn't want your mother to play a grandmother role, she can't expect your mother to front grandmother money.\n\nBut honestly I think you need to look over your relationship and see how else your wife is being unreasonable. Because I get not wanting to fight for the bedroom tonight since you need your sleep for work perhaps, but if you just give in when she's being unreasonable and allow her to take over space in the house, it's something you should start fighting back on because you two are partners in equals in the house. It's unreasonable for her to decide that you need to sleep on the couch because she's angry with you and wants to punish you and not settle the issue. It's an advanced version of the silent treatment and it's not acceptable", "NTA but your wife seems like a real piece of work", "Some times we end up with exact people we are trying to run away from\u2026 NTA but please get in couples counseling because your wife seems just as toxic", "Info- could you give an example of one of the humors your family does?", "And bet you anything that OPs wife will still expect xmas gifts and, birthday gifts for her daughter.", "Indeed, it sounds like you need to start stepping up now rather than being a boat steadier. Your kid doesn't deserve to grow up in an environment like this. You need to start standing up to your wife when she's being unreasonable, rather than just slightly talking back and then folding and going to sleep on the couch", "I mean I don't think it's actually about the baby talking, it sounds like she's just trying to get rid of his family cuz she doesn't like them. Which feels like an issue the poster should have a bigger issue with if he actually likes his family and doesn't want to be isolated with his wife, leaving him in the child to deal with her without any support. He needs to start fighting back for his kid", "I grew up in a very sarcastic family too, and I feel like it had a significant impact in me not knowing how to ID red flags because I couldn't identify when someone was actually trying to be mean vs bonding through meanness. \n\nI don't plan to shield my children from sarcasm, but I am going to make sure they have better tools to identify the difference between sarcasm and meanness and know how to trust themselves about any boundaries or comfort they have."]}
