Sounds like the court system got it right, and it sounds like you're fast tracking to have zero custody.", "YTA - rough situation, but you blew whatever future chance you had to change the custody arrangement more in your favor with this move. unfair as it may seem to you, you agreed to the custody situation and then violated them.", "I'm sorry, but YTA. It's not okay to sneak into anyone's house. You want to see your son for his birthday, be and adult and call your ex. Even better, go to court to make sure it is part of your agreement, Because you broke into his house during an event you were not invited to, best believe that he will use that against in your court. He's probably an ass, but causing this situation doesn't help you at all.", "YTA and you just made things worse for yourself. You might be seeing your son less because of this stunt.

You've sunk your chances of having split custody and Mike is obviously going to bring this up in court to argue even less time for you to see Cole as you were in direct violation of a court order. \n\nIt sucks, as you obviously just want to have more time with your son but you need to respect the law, and Mike, as much as you hate him.", "YTA. They didn\u2019t paint you as an addict, you are an addict first. You admitted it yourself.

You screwed yourself out of having your son in your life. You should reflect on this and humbly (and sincerely) apologize to your ex before you lose more time with your son.

And now you've broken a court ordered custody agreement.   Its a COURT ORDER, not a causal suggestion.", "YTA, I know you meant well but his lawyers could pull out agreement against you and make things worse.", "YTA\n\nI get that shared custody can be brutal, I also get the lawyers and money sometimes win.  I get that parents in custody disputes do get backed into corners sometimes and that the family court system isn't always fair.  However, given your past struggles with addiction and you arbitrarily deciding to trespass because you decided you had a right without even ASKING is what led me to this conclusion and put you in a potential position for a more difficult future custody battle. \n\nCourt ordered custody agreements are LEGAL documents and need to be followed as such.  You showing up to the party without written consent from the primary custodial parent is a violation of a legal document.  You also were trespassing at that point because you WERE NOT invited on the property, and then you took it even further by entering your ex's home without an invitation. \n\nGiven all of this paired with your past addiction issues, you now look like you have unpredictable and erratic behavior.  Your Ex can now take that to court and you have just made your custody battle harder for yourself.  You violated a legal document, trespassing laws, and provided proof that your judgement should be questioned, you could very well see your son less now.", "Y T A to yourself for this.  He will follow up with his lawyer.  I'm so sorry for what's about to happen.\n\n\"I decided that I have a right to see my son on his birthday\"\n\nYou do not have the right to trespass and unlawful entry someone's home.", "YTA\n\n>I have a right to see him on his birthday,\n\nI'm sorry, but you don't. You only have a right to see him during your scheduled parenting time. \n\nYou broke into your ex's house and caused drama on your son's birthday. You are angry and chaotic and have poor impulse control. That is how the court is going to see it. Don't let your son see it that way too.", "The first paragraph of this post is just pure venom towards your ex. It's hard to paint you as this saint of a mother when the first thing you try to do is paint your ex as this evil man.", "YTA.\n\nI sympathise with your broader situation (my mother went through similar in the court system with my youngest sibling) - but ultimately, you said it yourself. You broke into your ex's place, basically, on a day that wasn't yours to see him.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was also living w/ split custody w/ supervision initially, bc this was during the period where my mother was still v much in the thick of the addiction. But she at no point saw it as her place to barge in on days where I was with my father, be it birthday, xmas, NY, etc. She would instead make a weekend about me afterwards.\n\nThere was nothing stopping you from doing that. As it stands, doing this mostly screws you over further, and allows Mike to argue that you're not someone that can be trusted with your child.\n\nAgain, this is a situation I sympathise with you for (assuming your framing is fair), but you've played a stupid game, and now you're going to win a stupid prize.", "YTA why would you do this? You are just proving that you are exactly what he thinks you are. Its also not at all helpful to your child. He loves you both. If you have a agreements in place, you follow it. If you want to write a letter and see if you can join the party, do it the right way. Otherwise you will not have any custody. \nYou hating him with all your being is just toxic to your child. Please seek therapy. \n\nWhat you did was \u201cbreaking & entering\u201d you better count your lucky stars that you were not arrested yet. Bc frankly, if my husbands X Did that, you would be in jail.", "YTA. First of all, what your ex does with his time is none of your business. Secondly, you let yourself into someone\u2019s home knowing you were not welcome, that\u2019s trespassing. Furthermore, you lost primary custody for reasons other than your inability to hire a better lawyer and you know it.

I would say your son is in the right home.", "When your son\u2019s birthday falls on a Saturday and your ex waltzes in through your door, uninvited and trespassing, you\u2019ll be calling the police and taking him straight back to court. \n\nWhy do you think he shouldn\u2019t treat you the same way ? YTA. Seems like the courts got it right for once.", "Yta. You sound childish and like they made the right decision on custody.", "YTA\n\nYou're completely spiteful and full of hate. Your ex should document this type of behavior so you'll be restricted to supervised visits.", "YTA. You blame everything on Mike's expensive lawyers and nothing on your addiction. If you have been clean for 6 years and your son is 8, you were a terrible mother for at least 2 years of his life.

This is the path to getting less time with your child.\n\nFor decades, divorced fathers could expect, at best, to get every other weekend and an occasional Wednesday with their children.\n\nThankfully, that is beginning to change, but even in this new climate, it is rare for mothers to get less than 50/50 custody.\n\nYour decision to violate your custody agreement only reinforces that your ex should be the primary custodian of your child.", "YTA, you should be stripped of visitation rights and only get supervised visits.", "YTA.  No, you do not have the right to see your son on his birthday if that date is not part of your custody schedule.  Then you up the problems by trespassing into your ex's house?   Yup, this is going to read well when he takes you back to court.", "Yes, that is odd to sneak through a backdoor. You could have called or texted and knocked on the front door like a normal person. Then you both made a scene at your son's party. Classless behavior on both sides. You are both the asshole", "YTA. He could file a trespass complaint and cause more issues than you have now. You weren't invited and have a custody agreement that didn't allow you to have your son on that day.

I'm sorry about your situation, but, according to the court, you literally do not have a right to see your son unless your ex husband says so.

I don't know you or your husband, or whether he's an asshole. I don't know if you're actually a benevolent, loving mother who was taken advantage of due to her financial situation, or if your husband truly deserved full custody.

Knock it off or you'll find yourself seeing your son even less when Mike wins full custody.", "YTA. And you're fucked", "YTA You made a monumentally stupid decision based on pure emotion. \n\nYou violated the custody agreement and trespassed on Mike's property. He could have called the police and had you removed or arrested. He also may now have grounds to get a restraining order against you or ask the judge to give him full custody based on your disregard for the agreement and your \"instability\" demonstrated in arguing with him while your son was present. He and his attorney can twist your visit any way they want. You may hate your ex, but you sure are giving him gift after gift.\n\nYour situation sucks. But you have to stop making unforced errors. Life isn't fair, sadly. You are going to have to be strong and deal with the situation until you are in a position to fight for more visitation. \n\nDocument everything. See if you can find an attorney who will let you finance their representation of your case. Research what legal aid may be available to women in abusive situations. If your ex is this much of a jerk, I would imagine that he was at a minimum emotionally abusive to you. If not, use your free time during the week improve your financial situation. Get a higher paying job. Learn news skills off the internet (many are available for free) to start a side hustle or make a career change that will allow you to bring in more money to pay for a good attorney. \n\nYou seething in anger and violating the agreement is not going to help your situation.

A birthday party is supposed to be a happy occasion, and he may well become worried why dad is annoyed and could have internalised this as something that HE did wrong (for having a birthday) which just isn't fair.\n\nIf you had kept to the arrangement then you could have given the kid a second birthday / special day on your next visitation, instead of potentially putting a dampener on his one special day.\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever beef you and your ex have, your kid is what matters, try to make sure he is not affected by the animosity between you two", "Girl. Yes. YTA. Obviously. This is literally how it works with divorced parents; two birthday parties, Christmases, etc. \nYou chose to break the order and \"sneak in\" which just gives your ex more fuel against you.
