He has full custody and I get Cole on weekends, which I see as an absolute travesty. Because Mike makes a lot more money than I do, he was able to afford these high-powered lawyers, and they basically forced me to take a \"plea\" deal which lets me have Cole on weekends, as if I didn't they'd argue for full custody and no visitation. Knowing I couldn't afford a lawyer nearly as good as them, I decided to take the deal, but it's been the worst decision of my life.

It's not okay to sneak into anyone's house. You want to see your son for his birthday, be and adult and call your ex. Even better, go to court to make sure it is part of your agreement, Because you broke into his house during an event you were not invited to, best believe that he will use that against in your court.

I get that parents in custody disputes do get backed into corners sometimes and that the family court system isn't always fair.  However, given your past struggles with addiction and you arbitrarily deciding to trespass because you decided you had a right without even ASKING is what led me to this conclusion and put you in a potential position for a more difficult future custody battle. \n\nCourt ordered custody agreements are LEGAL documents and need to be followed as such.  You showing up to the party without written consent from the primary custodial parent is a violation of a legal document.  You also were trespassing at that point because you WERE NOT invited on the property, and then you took it even further by entering your ex's home without an invitation. \n\nGiven all of this paired with your past addiction issues, you now look like you have unpredictable and erratic behavior.  Your Ex can now take that to court and you have just made your custody battle harder for yourself.  You violated a legal document, trespassing laws, and provided proof that your judgement should be questioned, you could very well see your son less now.", "Y T A to yourself for this.

You only have a right to see him during your scheduled parenting time. \n\nYou broke into your ex's house and caused drama on your son's birthday. You are angry and chaotic and have poor impulse control. That is how the court is going to see it.

It's hard to paint you as this saint of a mother when the first thing you try to do is paint your ex as this evil man.", "YTA.\n\nI sympathise with your broader situation (my mother went through similar in the court system with my youngest sibling) - but ultimately, you said it yourself. You broke into your ex's place, basically, on a day that wasn't yours to see him.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was also living w/ split custody w/ supervision initially, bc this was during the period where my mother was still v much in the thick of the addiction. But she at no point saw it as her place to barge in on days where I was with my father, be it birthday, xmas, NY, etc. She would instead make a weekend about me afterwards.\n\nThere was nothing stopping you from doing that. As it stands, doing this mostly screws you over further, and allows Mike to argue that you're not someone that can be trusted with your child.\n\nAgain, this is a situation I sympathise with you for (assuming your framing is fair), but you've played a stupid game, and now you're going to win a stupid prize.", "YTA why would you do this? You are just proving that you are exactly what he thinks you are. Its also not at all helpful to your child. He loves you both. If you have a agreements in place, you follow it.

And you're fucked", "YTA You made a monumentally stupid decision based on pure emotion. \n\nYou violated the custody agreement and trespassed on Mike's property. He could have called the police and had you removed or arrested.

If we're being honest, I hate Mike with every fiber of my being.

A birthday party is supposed to be a happy occasion, and he may well become worried why dad is annoyed and could have internalised this as something that HE did wrong (for having a birthday) which just isn't fair.\n\nIf you had kept to the arrangement then you could have given the kid a second birthday / special day on your next visitation, instead of potentially putting a dampener on his one special day.\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever beef you and your ex have, your kid is what matters, try to make sure he is not affected by the animosity between you two", "Girl. Yes. YTA. Obviously. This is literally how it works with divorced parents; two birthday parties, Christmases, etc. \nYou chose to break the order and \"sneak in\" which just gives your ex more fuel against you.

The boy is 8. This woman was apparently an active addict for the first two years of her son\u2019s life. And how long before that? Did she use during her pregnancy? I don\u2019t know how long it would take me to feel comfortable handing over any kind of custody in her ex\u2019s place.", "She\u2019s been clean 6 years. Her son is 8. Even a mathematically challenged person such as myself can figure out she was using the first 2 years of her son\u2019s life. And who knows how long she was using before he was born and if her addiction was in force during the pregnancy.\n\nOP didn\u2019t lose custody because the ex had a better lawyer. She lost because the ex is the better parent.\n\nAnd based on OP\u2019s judgement, disregard for the agreement and apparent belief that she\u2019s a victim, 6 years clean or not, the ex is still the better parent.", "I don't believe OPs narrative on the dad.", "We dont know if dad would have been ok wt a stop by, if she asked.", ">flippant disregard of several laws\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's exactly the problem, and a very likely reason she doesn't have custody. A lack of impulse control when she feels justified in her actions. That's not a good thing in parenting, and this was certainly not a good bit of role-modeling for the kid.   \n\n\nI feel bad for OP. It sounds like she could still use a lot of therapy, as \"ating someone \"with every fiber of my being\" belies a lack of perspective.  \n\n\nYTA.", "> what legal aid may be available to women in abusive situations. If your ex is this much of a jerk, I would imagine that he was at a minimum emotionally abusive to you.\n\nThere is literally NO evidence of this, whatsoever.    For all we know, OP was abusive to *him* and, when they divorced, he took steps to protect himself and their son.  And, surprise, surprise doesn't want her or her drama in his life, (allegedly) clean or not.", "I disagree with your NAH.  She is making a scene when she could have spoken to him.  If the dad is truly not letting her son talk to her during his time, depending on the verbiage of the agreement, he could be in violation too.  That said, she would have seen him in a couple days to wish him a happy birthday. Then she could have chosen to explain why she wasn't there on his actual birthday (your father wouldn't let me which, while a difficult thing to manage with a kid, is at least the truth).", "Or protecting the child from the OP.", "How is he abusing it, though ? By holding a party for his son during his parenting time ? \n\nBy not inviting OP ? That sucks, but co-parenting relationships aren\u2019t easy, and he doesn\u2019t *owe* her an invitation into his home or life. OP is not painting a good picture of herself by acting this irrational: \u201cI have a right to see my son outside of my custody time so I\u2019m going to break into my ex\u2019s home to see my son\u201d.", "Idk if that is true. She was an actual addict and he has every right to protect his child from a mom that clearly sees no boundaries. \n\nThis action proves he is not over reacting. She broke into his home wto permission. That, is a crime.", "Yea. Id be freaked out if my hubs x did this. (There isnt one) but still.  She broke in. Thats creepy af & shows she doesn\u2019t care abt the court or people\u2019s boundaries. Ew", "I have a feeling she just stepped in it, big time."]}
