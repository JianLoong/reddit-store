For ease of reading, we'll simply call them A, B and C.

As the age gap isn't that big between us, I spent a lot of time with them and they're almost like little sisters to me as opposed to nieces. C is 9. \n\nWhen I got engaged and decided on my wedding party, I included B as a bridesmaid. A and C are very much still invited. Everything was fine until C found out that B was going to be a bridesmaid and not just a regular guest. She became incredibly upset and I received a call from my sister, asking me to give her a role as well. I explained that I was sorry but I would not. \n\nA and I don't talk as much anymore as she's currently away at university, living her own life. She took absolutely no offense to not being a bridesmaid and agreed that it would probably be a bit weird as we weren't quite as close as B and I (She's absolutely lovely, we just don't have much in common). \n\nMy sister was told she would never be able to have children of her own. C is a miracle baby. As such, my sister has admittedly spoilt her a lot and to be quite honest, she's not the most pleasant child to be around. It's not her fault, and I understand that, however I still don't want her in my wedding party. It's causing a lot of tension. AITA for not just giving in on this? \n\n\nAdditional context for examples of what I mean by C being an unpleasant child:\n\nI'm a zoologist. Animals are my passion. C watches videos about building rat traps and then explains to me in graphic detail how the rat will die. When I ask her to stop as I don't enjoy content like that, she finds it incredibly amusing. \n\nMy cat died. C came over to visit along with B. She kept making comments about how my cat was dead and chanting \"You don't have a cat\". \n\nShe's prone to lying and throws tantrums + cries whenever she hears the word \"no\".

At 2, yes, the terrible two ! But at 9, she has a bad temper and I suppose that A and B didn't do that to you when they were 9.\n\nRemember one important rule about the wedding : it's yours. Only yours. Nobody can tell you what you have to do, who you must invite, what will be the menu. You're two to decide.

And IF a child of mine behaved that way I would 1) be deeply embarrassed, 2) explain to them it is incredible rude and inconsiderate and if they behave that way no one will like them, and 3) be deeply concerned that they have no empathy and if I can't teach it to them get them therapy.  \n\nYou need to be honest with your sister that her unpleasant brat is not going to be an enjoyable addition to the wedding party.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding, you should do what you want.\n\nI understand sibling jealousy but 9 is old enough to understand that you don't always get what you want.\n\nOn top of this, she shouldn't be rewarded after being a taunting little prick.\n\nIf she wasn't such a terror, and her mother asked you politely, I would say it's worth considering for a child but that's not the case.", "NTA.

Why? To \"keep the peace\"?", "OP, C will never get better if your sister continues this behavior.  It will only get worse from here.", "This JUST made me reread OPs username and I can't agree more.", "Because I favour the other two over C and I'm fully aware that that's not something I should do as a loving family member. Excluding her from the wedding completely just felt like it would be punishing her for something that isn't completely her fault. Is she awful? Undeniably. But she's also just a kid who was not raised right and to some degree doesn't know better.", "But a kid free wedding is normal. Doesn't single out C. Saves you a lot of hassle. Just a thought.", "You\u2019re very noble, OP, but you do have legitimate grounds for not inviting her. How she was raised isn\u2019t your fault, but it\u2019s your day. You\u2019re allowed to want it to be peaceful and fun without the stress of a child throwing a tantrum."]}
