While she was close with another of her nieces (technically niece but they are about a year apart in age, and my aunt is only 5 years older than me), but the other niece doesn't drink and wasn't comfortable partying so my aunt asked me instead. \n\nThe other wedding was mine, which was tiny (~30 people including dj/photographer/officiant), I had 2 bridesmaids and a moh. The only family in the bridal party was my cousin (same person as the niece above that doesn't drink). Not for lack of trying on my older sister's part, but I eventually found my spine and put my foot down.\n\nKeep you spine shiny and firm OP!", "Yeah, it\u2019s not even that she wanted to be in the wedding party, just that B is gonna be in it and she\u2019s not.", "Or maybe it is time to learn that this actually is fair: B has developed a close relationship with OP and gets the honor of being a bridesmaid. People who are not as close don't get that opportunity. B clearly understands the fairness of it!\n\nI do hope OP stands her ground. Nobody should bully their way into a wedding party!", "Normal my ass \ud83d\ude09", "I also agree 100%. My own 10yo daughter would be getting a lesson or two on behavior and entitlement. Thankfully IME, most kids have outgrown that kind of behavior before 9 or 10.", "I was 9 the first time I was part of a wedding.  You know, as a flower girl. \n\nThis does not mean that OP should have to put a hateful out-of-control child anywhere near her already stressful wedding day.", "Wouldn't be r/AmItheAsshole without someone suggesting going no-contact over one little family disagreement.\n\nSometimes I wonder what later life will be like for people like you, whose first reaction to every little quibble is to go scorched earth.", "Came here to say this. That behavior is far from normal and I would be massively concerned. \n\nOP NTA. Don\u2019t invite C. C needs therapy yesterday.", "But was the dress ugly?  Seems like a good number of them are.", "This is not a typical 9 year old. This is an unkind brat child.", "Especially one who willingly brings up topics that disturb OP and are amused when told to stop, or taunt OP about her dead cat shortly after it passed.\n\nWho'd want /that/ at a wedding?", "I would be very careful about anything leading up to the wedding (the child having access to your dress or her sister\u2019s dresses, for instance, someone ready to intervene if you do invite her and she does something during the service, etc.)\n\nThis is one of those instances where if she does something impulsive and stupid like knock over a wedding cake at your reception or cut up her sister\u2019s dress days before the ceremony, you\u2019re going to get the argument from others that \u201cshe\u2019s just a child, she didn\u2019t realize\u201d and some bystanders will think you\u2019re overreacting because 9 year olds do often make childish and impulsive mistakes. You\u2019re also going to have more conflict if you try to make your sister pay for anything her child costs you. \n\nYou know, from her past behavior, that it\u2019s beyond just a child making a single mistake. But others won\u2019t and you\u2019ll look like a monster if you lose it with a 9 year old who \u201coops, was playing and clumsy around the cake.\u201d", "I hate to say it but this stuff is not normal. The obsession with dead animals is disturbing. And while kids do occasionally cry when told no, having temper tantrums about it at the age of 9 every, single time is not normal either. I'm sure you know already but your sister is doing a major disservice to her daughter. One day, she'll be an adult and this kind of stuff won't fly.", "OP, i don't know about other kids in your family, but for your sanity and the saftey of the wedding, if you have time, make your wedding childfree with the cut off being 16 (with B being 17). The lowest I would go is 13 and claim \"13 is the first teenage year\"\n\nGood luck and NTA", "Have a child free wedding", "No way, that kids is going to cause a major situation at the wedding or the sister will. best wishes to Op for a beautiful wedding", "Honestly, I would be hiding my wedding dress and really think if I would let her attend the wedding.\n\nI find it pretty disturbing how much she's lacking empathy at the age of 9. And taunts about dead animals and finds it funny. \nThe girl should be seeing a therapist alongside her mom if mommy dear thinks that's normal child behaviour.", "Especially not a little kid who apparently delights in making OP upset even on regular days and uses being their mama's \"miracle\" to get her way on everything.", "Ooh, nice reframing!", "Your sister either needs to bring some of that back or she'll have nobody but herself to blame when C's behaviour keeps escalating.", "Yes! This is what I thought! That is NOT normal behavior for a child.", "Not unless your sister wakes up and starts actually parenting her daughter, including the concept of consequences.", "I didn't think so. She liked it before I told her she couldn't go.", "I'm concerned about C's behavior on your big day.  Fingers crossed.", "Yeah. On the one hand, being into dead things/being morbid is pretty normal, my own kiddo is *super* into a little sandbox game where she violently dismembers vegetable-people (the watermelon of course bleeds red, too.) But she likes morbid things in *fiction*, if she was doing that to real living creatures you can bet I'd have her in therapy SO FAST.\n\nAs a former Goth myself, I gotta bring up that you can be Little Wednesday Addams in your hobbies/interests and still be a kind person in reality, though.\n\nHonestly my kid is disgustingly sweet! She was playing a Jenga-type game the other day with her grandma and knocked the tower over, and was upset, and Grandma said \"Let's play again, I bet I'll knock it over and you can laugh at how bad I am!\" and my kiddo replied that she didn't want to do that, she wouldn't laugh at anyone.", ">I find it pretty disturbing how much she's lacking empathy at the age of 9.

The girl should be seeing a therapist alongside her mom if mommy dear thinks that's normal child behaviour.\n\nWoudl be in-character for Wednesday Addams.  Although Wednesday would not want to attend the wedding.  But she would want to receive an invitation, specifically so that she could turn the invitation down.", ">Also I love your username.\n\nDarn it, I don't get the joke. Can you explain it, or would that literally crush the humor out of it?", "Yep, then that\u2019s just kid logic. Ugly = didn\u2019t want to go anyway so there!", ">Yeah. On the one hand, being into dead things/being morbid is pretty normal\n\nOh, i get that. Don't worry. \nI personally love true crime shows and will watch them with popcorn and everything. I'm fascinated by psychology. So that's a bit my thing. \nBut I would never go do the things. Or want to watch it in real life. \n\nAnd as a mom myself. \nI've seen some....creative plays sometimes. A dinosaur vs. humans come to mind specifically. With a very hungry t-rex. \nI did the quick 2-second blinking and decided to just go back to doing the dishes when I heard \"...he can't walk. He got eaten.\" \n\nAnd outside of Dino's going rampage, my kid is the kind that might cry if they see another cry and want to bring bandaid. \n\nSo I'm fully on board here.", "Cool, but this child is not Wednesday Addams and is hurting a real person's feelings. They need to learn that their cute, edgy personality actually hurts people and if that requires therapy, so be it.", "It\u2019s a reference to the show *Avatar the Last Airbender*. :)", "This is what you tell your sister - \"I have already made an accommodation for C.  I wanted a child-free wedding but didn't think that was fair to C.  If this becomes something that will disrupt my wedding, I am going to make it child-free.\"  Save the discussion about her upbringing for a time different than your wedding - you don't need it hijacked further!", "OP, 9-year-olds /do/ know better. That's more than old enough to know right from wrong. Kids can still choose to be kind even when they get everything handed to them and get no consequences.\n\nC is /banking/ on getting her way precisely because she's young and has discovered by now that she can get away with everything because everyone either gives her a pass, makes \"an exception\", or are made to do either of those by her mother.\n\nAnd what does she choose to do repeatedly when there's no consequences? To be mean, obnoxious and throw tantrums and lie.\n\nYou don't want that at your wedding.\n\nIt is high time someone shows this girl that consequences are for /everyone/ and that treating others in mean spirit has consequences such as being excluded from events where people don't want to be surrounded by mean people or walk on eggshells.", "You need to have someone act as bodyguard/bouncer(not your sister) in case she misbehaves--because I can about 99% guarantee she will.", "what does \u201cint\u201d mean in the un though? i thought the quote was \u201cthere is no war in ba sing se\u201d", "Not sure! u/no_int_in_ba_sing_se?", "The int refers to \"inting\" (intentional feeding) in video games, which is essentially playing badly.
