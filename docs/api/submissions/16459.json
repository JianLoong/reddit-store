We\u2019ve recently had an issue with a client smearing in the bathroom stalls. My roommate \u201cViolet\u201d (27) and I are very close and we will vent to each other about our days when we get home. A couple days ago I was talking to Violet about this smearing issue and she started to back away from me. I asked what was wrong and she said she was disgusted (total fair I am too, it\u2019s nasty) and she left to go to her room. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until she text me saying that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable having me in the house \u201cbecause of your proximity to free range feces\u201d and doesn\u2019t want me coming back to the house until this issue is resolved/no longer happening.\n\nTo provide context I don\u2019t go near this client. I don\u2019t touch or even interact with him closely because he is not my personal client. I sanitize and wash my hands constantly at work so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not keeping myself clean and protected. Every surface this client touches is immediately sanitized by one of the staff as well. I explained this to Violet but she said it still makes her uncomfortable knowing that and thinks I should stay somewhere else for the time being. I asked her where I was supposed to go and she said I should stay with my BF. My BF lives with his family so that\u2019s not an option. I reminded her of that and she said I could go to stay with my parents but they live in the opposite end of the city and it would take me 2 hours to get to work every day if I did that. Plus I don\u2019t think this should even be an issue in the first place. I shouldn\u2019t be kicked out of my own home where I pay half the rent because of this. I told her I would be coming home like usual and would continue to keep myself safe and clean while at work but she didn\u2019t like that and is now mad at me. She\u2019s been avoiding interacting with me since and sent a passive aggressive text listing a number of shared appliances in our home that she\u2019d prefer I didn\u2019t use until the issue at work was resolved. I told her if she\u2019s going to be this uncomfortable then she should go and stay somewhere else cause she\u2019s the one with the issue not me. She says she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go (she does not have family in our city or a partner she can stay with) while I have two options of places I could stay instead so I should be the one to leave. She said since I told her about this her anxiety has been through the roof (she is worried about getting sick) and if cared about her I would take one for the team and move out until the issue is resolved\u2026.\n\nTBH this behaviour from her is really surprising, I\u2019ve never had her act like this before. I make sure to keep myself clean and safe at work, I do not see the issue here at all but maybe I\u2019m in the wrong? I asked Violet if she would have this attitude if I was a nurse around lots of bodily functions all day and she said that\u2019s different but I fail to see how?
