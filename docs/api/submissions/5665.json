She is really excited. But\u2026she found out she is having triplets\u2026 the dad (45m) is a real piece of work and won\u2019t be in the picture (and can\u2019t offer financial support), she doesn\u2019t make very much money and she has no savings. I myself have 2 kids and even with the financial and emotional support of my partner it can be very stressful.\n\nOver the past few weeks I\u2019ve gently tried to tell her that it may not be green pastures ahead. She doesn\u2019t even have a functional car right now. It\u2019s like her head is stuck in the sand and she\u2019s only talking about how amazing it will be, how blessed she is, how it\u2019s a miracle, how she\u2019ll just \u201cfigure it out.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas Eve she surprised the rest of the family with the news after doing a big surprise scavenger hunt that led to 3 onesies.  Her mom already knew but told grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. She didn\u2019t get the reaction she was hoping for. Some people told her she should consider her options like adoption or abortion (even though some are very conservative and pro life), some talked to her about how hard this will be, asked about how she will afford this, wanted to know what support the dad would be giving, etc. It was not very celebratory. I could tell she was upset and she left early.\n\nI went to talk to her this morning in her (studio) apartment. I told her I was sorry for everyone\u2019s reaction but that I could see where the family was coming from and that they just wanted the best for her and were concerned. I asked her what she expected the reaction to be and she told me she thought everyone would rally together to help her now and to offer a bunch of help once the babies arrived. She expected financial support too. I told her that she can\u2019t rely on others like that and she will likely have to figure a lot of this out on her own if she goes through with it.\n\nShe told me that I\u2019m horrible, that our family is terrible and that we all deserve each other and that unless she gets our support she\u2019ll cut us all out. Then she told me to leave.\n\nIn some ways I think it is a reality check, but the more I think about it, I also know how overwhelming it is to be pregnant and I am sorry that she didn\u2019t get any happy reactions or offers of support. Especially because in the past, other family members have gotten very happy family reactions when sharing their pregnancies.

If she keeps the babies then she will find that out quickly enough.", "NTA\n\nI really feel for her, some of those reactions were cruel and some best left for another time. \n\nI feel for those babies more. \n\nI'm not sure how she expects to get support by cutting everyone out. I hope she realizes, and works to get as much support as possible.", "NTA - but your cousin in going to get a hell of a reality check. Since she\u2019s having triplets, she is basically guaranteed to have her children in the NICU due to prematurity.  She\u2019d be incredibly lucky if this didn\u2019t happen.  Caring for 3 newborns is going to take more than one person, and it doesn\u2019t sound like she understands this. She can\u2019t just assume family is going to financially support her and be her full time Nannies. That isn\u2019t realistic.  Her life is about to get real hard.", "NTA, reading your comments, I think her expectations of the family are unrealistic. She needs to come down to earth, her head is in the clouds. Yes, we\u2019re happy she\u2019s having a baby, but we\u2019re unhappy that she will have 3 with very little support. As you have explained your family is not well off and everyone has jobs and families, giving her maximum support, as she expects, will be impossible.", "NTA\n\nSome people are not ready to be parents and she seems like she's one of them, especially with triplets and no father in the picture.

She is trying to think of ways to get by, and it is easier to talk oneself into believing everyone in the family will participate in the raising of triplets.  She is kidding herself right now and living in a fantasy world.  She lashed out when you popped the fantasy bubble.  The more she thinks about it, the more she will realize you are correct.  That doesn't mean she'll forgive you, though.", "Nta she needed a head check that these are her babies her responsiblity and no one elses", "NTA\n\nIt is fair to expect support from the family, but it will be minor. She will be by herself most of the time, cause other people have their own lives, kids, etc.\n\nYou are being realistic.\n\nAlso, it sounds like a bad choice (having 3 kids from a deadbeat is a bad choice by default), and I'm not a fan of supporting other people's bad choices.", "NTA. Having one baby when you don\u2019t have a good financial foothold is a challenge. Three babies?!?  God forbid one of them has health issues. She is going to have to grow up very quickly. Could anyone in the family offer help with a resume update so she can find a better employment situation before the babies arrive?", "NTA and I think your family should all think about this and draw their lines in the sand now. And point blank tell her all the ways they *won't* be contributing. She needs to know upfront Mom doesn't have any extra cash to spare, Dad doesn't have a spare bedroom, sister's too busy to help babysit, Grandpa's too ill to handle little ones running around. You are maxed out with your own life and won't come running when she is overwhelmed.\n\nAll pregnancies are not blessings. Remember the recent vid of the grandma finding out her irresponsible kid is having a third child? Grandma knew she'd be expected to handle it when they couldn't handle the kids they already had. But yay every child is a blessing, right? Sometimes kids are a.burden and an imposition on others - even if you love them. Hell the love itself is sometimes a burden. That poor grandma had no say of course. She's just expected to sacrifice even more of her life. Cousin needs to know the limits of other people helping.", "NTA for agreeing. I\u2019d say if you care enough about your younger cousin, it\u2019s worth trying to help her through this even if she\u2019s pushing you all away. I agree that dumping money in her bank account might not be the way to go about it, but perhaps you and other empathetic family members can find other ways to help her; fill her fridge every now and then, run some errands, check in on her and make sure she has what she needs, help her help herself by talking her through the short-term and long-term living/work/child care plan, etc\u2026 I have to assume that the pregnancy is taking a toll on her emotionally, especially coupled with what she\u2019s recently went through with the dad, so she\u2019ll need the support even if she\u2019s incapable of expressing that right now. Good luck to you all, OP, I wish you the best.", "NTA. Being realistic doesnt mean you wont support. However kids are expensive. When you factor in her being single, and the father not contributing to their upkeep, its quite rich to expect the rest of the family to contribute financially. \n\nIf she chooses to cut you out, so be it. Its her loss, not yours.", "NTA.  If a woman cannot provide a good life for children- SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM!  To make children suffer merely because the prospect sounds cute is ridiculous. Good, you guys letting her know at least removed some of the fog surrounding her brain.", "NTA \n\nThis story is crazy lol, first 45???? \n\nHow are you 45 and a deadbeat? Sad times. \n\nIf she can\u2019t even take care of herself, what makes her think she\u2019d be able to handle 3 babies? One baby is a lot so i know that 3 babies at the same time is even more. \n\nKids are expensive. This is a wake up call for her i hope.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have unprotected sex with someone you wouldn\u2019t have children with. And even if you\u2019re with someone, as a pregnant woman you should also be prepared to be a single mother. just in case something happens. \n\nThis question is a common conversation topic on twitter \u201cshould poor people have children?\u201d\n\nI said no, as someone that grew up poor i really hated it and it traumatized me. Children deserve better", "NTA", "ESH. You don't ever tell someone to get an abortion or to adopt their children out. That is a very personal decision. She absolutely should not expect financial support from the family, but some emotional support might be nice. But she will clearly not be getting either.", "AESH \n\nOkay, you\u2019re NTA, but\u2026 your family members who hold pro life views can\u2019t put their money where their mouth is and help a family member who is excited and wants to keep her babies? \n\nYour cousin is very much YTA for assuming everyone will be helping her do it alone as a single parent, but she probably developed that expectation from hearing other family members talk about how abortion is not an option ever. \n\nAnd why can\u2019t the babies\u2019 father contribute something? Is there a good reason he can\u2019t purchase off an Amazon wishlist every month? \n\nWhat your cousin needs is help identifying resources or building a plan on how this can work.

How can she make some extra money?", "ESH - ooh boy was I torn on this one... If it was just how the family reacted and not what happened when you went over, yeah the family and you are the arses. Even in the worst of circumstances, if someone is trying to share their joy with you, you don't kick them down.

I would suggest finding out about section 8 housing or income based housing. She needs to check into food stamps. Her children will qualify for WIC program. If she doesn\u2019t have insurance, she needs to do Medicaid/ Medicare program. Her children will be delivered early and they\u2019ll qualify for early childhood programs, where they can  offer speech, OT, PT and developmental therapy all is free until age 3 for children. Will it be difficult yes, but she needs to start researching local government programs that help people in this situation. She should see if she\u2019ll qualify for daycare vouchers & she uses the time to better herself like going back to school so she can get a better paying job or just go to the work.

If so, that's not a stretch for her to think they would do the same. If they haven't, they can always help her by suggesting state programs like WIC that would help. Suggesting she abort the babies or put them up for adoption is cruel if she's excited about being a mom. If SHE wanted to abort or put up for adoption, she would and that's her choice.
