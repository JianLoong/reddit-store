In 2021 her uncle got divorced and he begged u/ to move in to help him pay the bills or he\u2019d lose his house. We moved in to help with bills and helped him through his divorce as best we could. In early 2022 her uncle met a new woman, 2 months later they were engaged and her uncle moved in with his fiancee. At that time he offered us the house to buy, or pretty much get to packing cause he was gunna sell to a flipper to get out from under the house and pay off his debts. My friend and I took the deal to buy the house. We bought the house at the price he requested, which was under market value, but it's probably more than he would have gotten from a flipper.\n\nOnce we decided to buy we started cleaning. We gave uncle 3-4 months to get moved out and take literally whatever he wanted. After about the 4th month we bought a dumpster because there was a lot of stuff in the house. We began throwing away all the junk and expired things. The uncle told us multiple rooms he didn't want stuff from because it was all junk so we\u2019d throw stuff away. He left us quite a bit of junk, but house was basically furnished. Even for 2-3 months after we officially owned the house, we let her uncle return and keep taking stuff. One day he came with his wife and kid, grabbed a few things, and said \"I'm done taking things. What's left is all YOURS to do what you wish\". At that point we thought he was done. Well he kept asking for stuff and we kept giving it up for another month or so. Then we put a stop to it. \n\nHer uncle then cried to my friends GMA and her GMA made us give up more things, but the deal was the uncle would let us fix a large kitchen appliance under the warranty. When her uncle came to get what he wanted, we had placed the items in our carport for him to get. He then told us he was going to \u2018walk through the house one more time And take whatever he wanted\u2019. We refused to let him in. He called the cops and lied and said he left guns in the house in attempt to have the cops force us to let him in. We told the cop it was a lie and trespassed him from our property. \n\nHer uncle is now refusing to talk to us, refused to come to family events if we are there, and says he won't stop unless we give him more things. Are we just supposed to keep giving him things the entire time we own this house? If he sold to the flippers which was Plan B they would of sold off everything he left and he wouldn't have been able to keep coming and getting stuff like we allowed. My friends GMA has yelled at her over this and stopped talking to her a few times. It's been a big deal and it's annoying. Neither of us want to keep giving him shit. He's acting this way because her family has given into him his whole life because he's a boy so he just thinks we should give him what he wants.\n\nAITA for not continuing to just give him stuff he left and told us he didn\u2019t want and we now use?\n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1673100342, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105psla/aita_for_stopping_giving_the_prior_owner_of_our/", "score": 485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neither are you responsible for replacing things to give him back that you have disposed of or that have worn out/broken. \n\nIf either or both you move out, you\u2019d need a legal agreement to divide the home and the contents, and none of it would revert back to the uncle (unless you both choose to do so according to the new agreement)\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable if, say you decide to get rid of a furniture item, to give him first chance to claim it.

Maybe you guys should consider the great benefits of purchasing your own furniture so you don't have to deal with these types of problems. You won't lose sleep because YOU bought it, with YOUR money. I don't know I'm 33 years old, and this is my experiential opinion. Sometimes cutting corners by accepting free stuff from others will give you problems later. Your Uncle is petty, but you guys are also going down with him in the same pettiness.If you can afford to buy a house, you can afford to buy domestic items required for it, or else you have no business buying a house and you're trying to \"play grown up\".

It can also happen when grandparents own a holiday home open to all children and grandchildren, then it gets inherited by one grandchild and the rest of the family, aunts, uncles cousins etc believe the house is still open to them.

We\u2019ve considered heavily just giving in to him, but honestly we don\u2019t think that will resolve anything at this point.

They let him come back over and over again to get more stuff. He told them to keep it. It\u2019s not petty at all. Going through a divorce does not give you a pass to act however you want.

OP and friend made an agreement for some more items and made those items available to uncle...who *demanded access to whatever else he wanted without limit*, which they refused verbally. He clearly kept pushing, hence calling the cops, and he *lied to law enforcement to get access to more stuff*!\n\nWhat \"positive constructive\" things do you think they were supposed to say, exactly?!

We don\u2019t know what these things are. And yes the uncle should\u2019ve dedicated time to doing a very thorough sweep of the house before moving out. But: what if the uncle\u2019s perception was that since he sold the house to family, and he is on good terms with this family, he wasn\u2019t as pressed to do a final \u201cclean sweep\u201d as he would had he sold the house to strangers? \n\nWhat if he had no idea that saying \u201chey niece, I just remembered I left a box of Christmas ornaments in the attic, can I swing by tomorrow?\u201d was being perceived as intrusive?\n\nIt *sounds* like he didn\u2019t have an understanding that he was being intrusive until they \u201cput their foot down\u201d - at which point he complained to his mom his niece was forbidding entry and that xyz was still left behind. So mom negotiated a final \u201cswing by,\u201d upon where he discovered xyz sitting in the carport. Recognizing this is now his \u201cfinal swing by\u201d he asks to (finally) go through the house one last time. And they refuse and things implode. \n\nNow we have no idea what items he was routinely coming back for. Was he unplugging toaster ovens and ripping sheets off the beds? Or was he retrieving a box of sweatshirts in the basement and his skis?  The context matters.  \n\nAnd so does the question of whether he had any idea his \u201coh I forgot this, can I swing by?\u201d was being perceived as intrusive.", "Because we don\u2019t know if uncle saw he was crossing any boundaries.

Were they things he forgot? Or were they things he changed his mind about? Huge difference. \n\nAnyone who has ever moved out of their parents house knows what I\u2019m talking about \ud83d\ude09 there is very little pressure to make sure you do a fully clean sweep when you first move out.

Marge's niece saw the items on FB marketplace, told Marge and then all hell broke loose! Marge called us IRATE saying that we \"stole her stuff out from under her\" and \"if she knew that those items were in the house she would have taken them.\" We told her she had 12 YEARS to get her stuff out and chose not to - she still had million excuses why 12 years wasn't enough time, LOL. She got to the point that she threatened to CALL A LAWYER ABOUT A HOUSE SOLD 12 YEARS PRIOR!!! We told her to go right ahead - we're still waiting on that call from the lawyer (and Marge is still angry at us and had the GALL to ask for some of the money we got from selling the items. That's hilarious.).", "> Joking here, but if he insists everything he sold with the house is still his, send him an invoice for storage fees,\n\nLOL - years back I had a friend who shared and apartment with another person.

Silence.\n\nFinally, after the two years, my friend decided not to renew the lease and move. So, she had to clear the place out. She put the left behind items on FB marketplace for a cheap price with the caveat they had to be moved out of the basement. Sure enough, a couple of young guys with a truck show up later that day, pay the money, load the items and leave.\n\nSomehow the former roommate caught wind of this and called my friend IRATE - she said \"How DARE you sell MY items? I can't believe you did that. You should at least give me the money you got.\" My friend laughed and said, \"Really? I called you for two years and you didn't return a single call. I had to store those items in my basement for that entire time. Now I know most small units at a storage center are $500/mo but since it's my basement, I'll just charge you $250/month. So, I stored your items for 24 months at $250/month, so that's $6000, less the $250 I got for the items, so you actually owe ME $5750. Will you be sending a check?\" The former roommate just hung up the phone and my friend never heard from her again...", "Enough already.

If he had sold to a flipper anything he had left would have been trashed and the house sold for a profit."]}
