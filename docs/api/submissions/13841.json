Educate yourself about basic food hygiene.", "You keep commenting so I'll try to help.\n\nFirst and foremost:\n\nThe world is filthy and we are resilient. Even the best quality control does not require product to be 100% bacteria free. We aim for that, for obvious reasons, but humans are generally resilient and if proper food safety is followed in the home/restaurant /store we can minimize the potential damage the 0.01% of allowable bacteria can actually do.\n\nAs someone else said in a comment \"Do you think if you never opened a milk carton, it would never go bad?\" get a few half gallons or bottles of milk and let them sit in your fridge unopened for 1 month, 2 months or even 3 months past the best by date, and judge for yourself. If you never opened the bottle before then where did the bacteria come from?\n\nThe answer is there is PLENTY of bacteria currently dead and frozen in the ice cream. Thawing it can bring some of them \"back to life\" a little sooner making the fight with your immune system a little tougher. Bacteria multiply VERY fast. \n\nSecondarily:\n\nWe are filthy and constantly shedding different diseases we picked up around our travels. Some of these foodborne illnesses can live in soil, dust, and other bits of particulate debris. To take the ice cream out of the freezer and microwave it creates layers of warmer dairy. Anything above 40F is considered \"The danger zone\" in food prep. Typically things need to be in this temperature range for hours for actual problems to occur. \n\nHowever if this person is thawing and refreezing this tub of icecream 20 times, that's 20 times that the container is opened, areas of liveable temperatures are created and dust and human breath and other airborn containments can get into the container, colonize the newly thawed river of sugar and dairy, multiply and then get refrozen to await the next thaw to continue the process. \n\nWe can never fully eliminate these risks. Most of the time, most people could eat frozen and thawed and refrozen food and be fine. But it's a lottery you really don't have to play. General food safety is about removing those small risks as much as can be reasonable because everyone has to eat, and we have to eat often. You need to take this gamble at least once a day on average. Some people twice or even three times that. \n\n\nAs such, while these people are right that it does increase foodborne illness risk, it is a slight increase (unless OP is microwaving this tub until the whole container is goop OR they microwave it very often). \n\nThere is the extra point though that this 100% does alter the flavor and texture of the ice cream. A certain amount of air is introduced that is lost in the refreezing process, and static freezing in a freezer rather than an icecream maker allows larger ice crystals to form. Both resulting in harder, \"flatter\" more seperated ice cream.", "Shame, it was way funnier imagining it being your MIL\u2019s ice cream.

Given OP was very clear that she is not defrosting the ice cream completely and given she'd freeze it again immediately, I don't see how the microwave technique could have any significant impact on the risks vs the alternative of just leaving it out at room temperature for a period of time to soften.", "I think it gets it half an inch further in than cold.

Bacteria is already present, and repeated freeze thaws allow for exponential growth, which means it\u2019s significantly less safe each freeze-thaw", "I think the difference, and it's again very slight,\n\nIs leaving it out to thaw will likely result it just the exterior surfaces thawing and because its a slower process it likely will only thaw \"just enough\" that most or even all of the icecream will remain below the 40F mark.\n\nWhen microwaving (varies with model/type of microwave) you get pockets of heating action, throughout the entire food  substance, including the center of the food. This will of course vary dramatically depending on the substance and even the position in the microwave, as well as the microwave's construction itself.\n\nIt is possible that OP's microwave when heating up the icecream enough to scoop out a portion from the top, has already softened or even melted portions that wouls have otherwise remained completely frozen nearer the center of the container.\n\nI think the amount of the icecream that becomes unfrozen can matter as much as the time it remains unfrozen.\n\nAnd you're right, in regards to bacteria number of cycles doesn't matter. It does matter with texture quality and it is usually correlates with time as well, more cycles means more time thawed. And it presents for opportunities for introducing new bacteria. But by itself, number of cycles isn't important for bacteria growth.\n\nPersonally I'm not a big fan of the \"leave it out to soften\" advice either. The microwave is worse, because it likely melts more of the icecream than it would naturally from conductive/convective heat loss. But it's still the same idea.\n\nNah I'm with Camp Your Freezer Is Too Cold, and Team Quality Ice Cream Scoop and Hot Water.\n\nLike. My icecream scoop could likely be used as a hammer in a pinch.

Bacteria will grow in milk or milk products depending on time spent above freezing point. \n\nLet's imagine it takes 24 hours above freezing to get to the point where its unsafe to eat.\n\nThat 24 hours can be all at once, by leaving the tub at room temperature. Or it can be bit by bit during periods when it's not frozen. Imagine she completely defrosts it for 2 hrs, freezes it, defrosts it for another 2 hrs etc etc. Once the total time above 0 is 24, it will be unsafe to eat.\n\nThe number of freeze thaw cycles is irrelevant.\n\nAnd regardless, all of that makes no difference in this case since she is not defrosting it. Only softening it very slightly.", "This is like insisting that no one take milk out of the fridge because it increases the risk of it going off.\n\nThere is no 'risk' in the sense of chance. It's a completely predictable process. It will go off if left for x time at room temperature.

It'll be a dial with numbers.", "Your freezer temperature control is likely located on the top part of your fridge. The fridge temperature is controlled by what blows down from the freezer (if you have a top-bottom unit).", "Are you making stuff up as you go or is this total nonsense part of the \u2018magic\u2019 you think creates bacteria?", "Most people aren't microwaving the milk every time they take it out.", "I totally acknowledge your point about the bacteria already being present. That is correct. \n\nBut I'm genuinely curious, how do you think it works if it's not about the time?\n\nHow does the number of cycles affect anything?", "Indeed, but if they did that would also make almost no difference. It would maybe mean that the milk was above fridge temperature for very slightly longer because the fridge will take a bit more time to cool it down, which would very slightly reduce the life of the milk. But unless you're buying milk in unnecessarily large quantities it's still not going to go off before it's finished. And even if it does you'll be able to smell and taste if there is a problem so you still won't get sick.", "Well microwaves do not produce heat themselves. They cause the molecules to vibrate which in turn creates high heat inside the food. Which is why standing time is very important, as the ice cream will continue heating after it is removed from the microwave until the molecules stop vibrating. So there are localised regions inside the ice cream that reach higher temperatures, unlike if it was placed at room temperature and cooling occurs steadily.\n\nThe number of freeze thaws matters because it\u2019s not thawing slowly but being heating, allowing faster propagation of bacteria in the pockets of heat. And exponential growth is the cause of bacterial danger. If she does this 5 times and each time a bacteria goes through one reproductive cycle, bacteria has been multiplied by 32 in any of those regions.", "Molecules vibrating *is* heat. Those are two words for the same thing. The molecules in the ice cream don't stop vibrating unless it's at absolute 0. \n\nSomething that been taken out of a microwave doesn't continue to heat up afterwards, that would break the laws of the conservation of energy. What happens is that heat is slowly redistributed through the object by conduction after it's taken out.\n\nEven if, in the pockets of heat, the ice cream reached a temperature ideal for bacterial growth it would only be at that temperature for a matter of seconds because the temperature would rapidly equalise across the tub. The pockets would get cooled by the rest of the ice cream. Then she puts it back in the freezer and it's back to fully frozen within 20 mins or so. Given a tub of ice cream contains maybe 4 servings, she'd only be doing this 3 times. So you'd have a situation where the last serving might have been not fully frozen for around an hour in total. An hour is not long enough for bacteria to grow enough to become dangerous."]}
