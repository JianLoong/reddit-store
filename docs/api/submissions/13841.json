Educate yourself about basic food hygiene.", "You keep commenting so I'll try to help.\n\nFirst and foremost:\n\nThe world is filthy and we are resilient. Even the best quality control does not require product to be 100% bacteria free. We aim for that, for obvious reasons, but humans are generally resilient and if proper food safety is followed in the home/restaurant /store we can minimize the potential damage the 0.01% of allowable bacteria can actually do.\n\nAs someone else said in a comment \"Do you think if you never opened a milk carton, it would never go bad?\" get a few half gallons or bottles of milk and let them sit in your fridge unopened for 1 month, 2 months or even 3 months past the best by date, and judge for yourself. If you never opened the bottle before then where did the bacteria come from?\n\nThe answer is there is PLENTY of bacteria currently dead and frozen in the ice cream. Thawing it can bring some of them \"back to life\" a little sooner making the fight with your immune system a little tougher. Bacteria multiply VERY fast. \n\nSecondarily:\n\nWe are filthy and constantly shedding different diseases we picked up around our travels. Some of these foodborne illnesses can live in soil, dust, and other bits of particulate debris. To take the ice cream out of the freezer and microwave it creates layers of warmer dairy. Anything above 40F is considered \"The danger zone\" in food prep. Typically things need to be in this temperature range for hours for actual problems to occur. \n\nHowever if this person is thawing and refreezing this tub of icecream 20 times, that's 20 times that the container is opened, areas of liveable temperatures are created and dust and human breath and other airborn containments can get into the container, colonize the newly thawed river of sugar and dairy, multiply and then get refrozen to await the next thaw to continue the process. \n\nWe can never fully eliminate these risks. Most of the time, most people could eat frozen and thawed and refrozen food and be fine. But it's a lottery you really don't have to play. General food safety is about removing those small risks as much as can be reasonable because everyone has to eat, and we have to eat often. You need to take this gamble at least once a day on average. Some people twice or even three times that. \n\n\nAs such, while these people are right that it does increase foodborne illness risk, it is a slight increase (unless OP is microwaving this tub until the whole container is goop OR they microwave it very often). \n\nThere is the extra point though that this 100% does alter the flavor and texture of the ice cream. A certain amount of air is introduced that is lost in the refreezing process, and static freezing in a freezer rather than an icecream maker allows larger ice crystals to form. Both resulting in harder, \"flatter\" more seperated ice cream.", "Shame, it was way funnier imagining it being your MIL\u2019s ice cream.

They cause the molecules to vibrate which in turn creates high heat inside the food. Which is why standing time is very important, as the ice cream will continue heating after it is removed from the microwave until the molecules stop vibrating. So there are localised regions inside the ice cream that reach higher temperatures, unlike if it was placed at room temperature and cooling occurs steadily.\n\nThe number of freeze thaws matters because it\u2019s not thawing slowly but being heating, allowing faster propagation of bacteria in the pockets of heat. And exponential growth is the cause of bacterial danger. If she does this 5 times and each time a bacteria goes through one reproductive cycle, bacteria has been multiplied by 32 in any of those regions.", "Molecules vibrating *is* heat. Those are two words for the same thing. The molecules in the ice cream don't stop vibrating unless it's at absolute 0. \n\nSomething that been taken out of a microwave doesn't continue to heat up afterwards, that would break the laws of the conservation of energy. What happens is that heat is slowly redistributed through the object by conduction after it's taken out.\n\nEven if, in the pockets of heat, the ice cream reached a temperature ideal for bacterial growth it would only be at that temperature for a matter of seconds because the temperature would rapidly equalise across the tub. The pockets would get cooled by the rest of the ice cream. Then she puts it back in the freezer and it's back to fully frozen within 20 mins or so. Given a tub of ice cream contains maybe 4 servings, she'd only be doing this 3 times. So you'd have a situation where the last serving might have been not fully frozen for around an hour in total.

Microwaves soften much more evenly than just leaving it on the counter, but everybody in this thread is completely insane, so....", "There is nothing wrong with microwaving ice cream for 10 seconds. The people in here saying it completely changes the texture or it's unhygienic are psychotic.\n\nThere is no functional difference between leaving ice cream on the counter for 15 minutes or putting it in the microwave for 15 seconds. Just live your life.", "To be fair, plenty of ice cream these days is over $5 but I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re upping this to recent grocery inflation. My usual tubs are more $6-8 and not the most expensive where I am! Still not worth anyone being bummed out, just get two.", "To be fair, this only works if you\u2019re scooping (which OP probably was here for guests) and not eating from the container. But I guess some folks gave other issues with eating from the container (my husband and I both do this, usually with our own but sometimes we share).", ">... The way I understand it...\n\nYou don't understand it. Like at all.", "I can microwave it for ten seconds and already be eating it before the water would get hot.  It slightly softens the edges and top layer enough to scoop, while the rest is still hard.  It does not change the texture.   I've softened it on the counter also and found no difference at all", "Yes, I mentioned that in my comment. And the third bullet point is about the hot, wet spoon also being bad for the ice cream.", "I dip my scoop into a cup of warm bleach between scoops.", "You are not but OP is", "Microwave heats less evenly so you'll get more icey patches. Leaving it out will also make it icier but not as bad.", "Surely you get the ice cream last so there is no \"finish shopping\"?", "Bunch of kids with no idea what they are talking about in this thread.  OP isn't turn it to soup. They are just softening and then it's refreezing. Like any other time you take it out of the freezer.  People are weird and seem to think that Microwaves just make their food radioactive or something. Her way is no different than just letting it get soft from the room temperature, it's just faster.\n\nThe whole idea of refreezing being bad is because if you are dealing with something that's left out a long time it can allow bacteria to form, excrete waste, and then refreezing will have the new bacteria and the waste on food that accumulated while it was out.  What she's doing won't do that.", "I do neither of those and just go at it with frustration till I get a good chunk.", "Hm, that's very interesting. Because people in this thread are saying that it ruins the air bubbles in the ice cream and makes it less fluffy but my personal experience with ice cream in a carton is NOT airy or fluffy at all, it's very hard straight out of the freezer.

Your own tub is one thing, but shared is a no no", "She doesn't even have to do all that, when I was a little kid my grandmother showed me how to run the hot water in the sink and hold the scoop under it for 20 or 30 seconds, if my 90 pound 75 year old grandmother with Rheumatoid arthritis to the point her knuckles were the size of golfballs could scoop out ice cream that way, then OP can.", "a bit dramatic\u2026 the ice cream will taste the exact same", "How in the world is letting the ice cream melt slowly better than doing it quickly? Either way you're letting the temperature rise and then lower in repeated cycles.", "The end result is the same as using the microwave for 20 seconds on very low.

We're not guranteed to live forever. If OP only does it to her own container of ice cream and knows the risk, then so be it. I would microwave my own tub of ice cream knowing the risks.

It's called melting it just enough and then taking the melted parts. If it was in there for 1m and the. It got put back it would be nasty.
