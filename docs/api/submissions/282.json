I know kids are weird and fussy, which is normal, but their likes and dislikes normally switch up every day or so and seem random. When a kid is so consistently \"picky\" there needs to be investigation and support. \n\nAnd again, I'm not saying that you should ever force your daughter to eat something she finds repulsive, but knowing the cause of these issues could help her immensely. Even if it just means that she knows *why* she can't tolerate certain foods.
