Every adult is aware you never run up a bill on a host. There\u2019s a tact to these things. Your friends violated that and then acted butt hurt when called out. Congrats on giving them a lesson in humility and decorum", "Oh, absolutely not! You're clearly not the asshole here; you're just a benevolent billionaire who enjoys treating your \"friends\" to lavish meals and luxurious vacations. I mean, why wouldn't you want to pay for the entire restaurant's menu while your kids dine like royalty off the child's menu?\r  \n\r  \nIt's utterly absurd for your friend to suggest that you might have been inconsiderate or that they took advantage of your generosity. Who cares about ordering the most expensive items on the menu, extra sides, and beer? It's just pocket change for someone with your \"larger income.\" And skipping dessert? That's just an efficient way to keep your figure while feeding the world with your leftovers.\r  \n\r  \nClearly, your friend has no understanding of the concept of generosity. So, don't worry, you're not the asshole; you're just the unsung hero of extravagant dining experiences!\n\n**NTA**", "NTA \n\nThey took advantage of you. Sounds like the problem is solved if they never go again. Why didnt you say no when they invited themselves? When my kids were young, I used to let them bring a friend on day trips and vacations and I never had any parents come along.", "NTA They are selfish ordering things that are so excessive, and they can't even eat all of what they order.  You are so generous, maybe you need to find some new friends.", "NTA, you should have said separate checks after he ordered and see what happened.", "NTA, but it's time for the adults to pay their own way. Also, if their parents are there, why are you footing the bill for all the children? \n\nYou are being taken advantage of because you are letting yourself get taken advantage of.", "NTA. It\u2019s quite obvious they\u2019re taking advantage of your kindness. Usually when you know someone else is paying, you try to be a bit more conscious of the cost of foods but this family clearly don\u2019t care", "NTA you needed to ask for separate checks for your family. Just because you usually pay doesn\u2019t mean you let them take advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nIf my friend says they are treating me for a meal I see what they are ordering and either order same price range or lower. If I want sides or extra I ask if they want to share or I cover it.\nHe is taking advantage of you but lucky you, he solve the problem and you'll never have to pay for him again..", "Also could have informed the wait staff that you\u2019re covering your, your wife\u2019s, and your kid\u2019s meal.", "NTA. And IF there is a next time, make it abundantly clear that each couple pays their own way.", "NTA. His rudeness is only surpassed by his entitlement and greed.", "I never understood how people can get so comfortable having their friends pay for so much repeatedly. I think that\u2019s kind of embarrassing in and of itself. (From your post I don\u2019t get the impression that they\u2019re poor, as you only mentioned your income is larger). \n\nThis level of comfort with spending your money is outright offensive. You never order something that\u2019s more expensive than what the host orders, unless they encourage you to do so. \n\nThese people need to contribute or learn how to say thank you and appreciate your generosity. The audacity. \n\nNTA", "ESH. \n\nYes, your friends abused your hospitality. But that was a risk you undertook when you offered to pay for them. If you had opinions on alcoholic beverages, desserts, etc, you should have vetted those concerns UP FRONT, not wait until after the food has arrived to complain passive-aggressively that they ordered too much food.\n\nDoesn't matter whether you're buying candy out of a vending machine or a large meal at a restaurant, have a quick discussion up front to set expectations about what you're paying for, and what you expect others to pay for. That's the mature way to handle it.", "Perhaps it\u2019s because this has become a pattern. I know if I were in Saud\u2019s shoes, my order would not have been the most expensive thing on the menu. However, when I pay for dinner for my friends, I am prepared to pay for the most expensive thing on the menu if they order it. In fact I tell them not to be shy and order what they want as they are my guests. ESH", "I'm usually very sensitive to what I order when others are offering to buy.  Generally I try to let them order first to determine what the acceptable price point is.  I've messed up a few times and felt horrible about it.  I always apologize and offer to buy the next meal.\n\nThat said, on vacation I'm looser with my budget and am willing to casually buy more.  Maybe next time Saud offers to buy, you can order what you want.  It might just be how he is and is fine with it.  It's vacation, you gotta relax some especially when expenses may be shared.\n\nMiddle Eastern people are more sensitive to image and don't like being ridiculed in public regardless of fault.  Next time try to be more subtle.  That's more of a cultural thing that's not stated too often.", "YTA. You need to either make it clear that there are restrictions on what they can order, remove all restrictions, or the best answer, stop paying for their meals.\n\nYou have no obligation to purchase their meals. If it is annoying to you, costs too much, are whatever else, you do not have to do so. But once you tell them you will, and you do not say something like, \"I've got this, but let's keep it to less than $XXXX\", then you need to just let them order. Note that they are abusing it and don't buy for them in the future, sure. But just making passive aggressive comments over something you volunteered to do is bad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
