How was them living separately considered normal? You also mentioned he is more in your personal space lately. This is called marriage.

Also you said you couldn't get married again, is that a personal view, a law, cultural boundary, or religious view?\n\nEdit: You are NTA on what you are asking about though., Both your parents and your husband should be respecting your wishes on this.
