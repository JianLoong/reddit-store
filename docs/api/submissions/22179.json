But spouses should be warm and caring with each other, want to know all about each other, want to spend time together, etc... Why don't you sit down together and have a talk about what he wants to know and why. And why he's going to your parents instead of you. Communication is very important.", "This feels like one of those times when someone from a non-Western background asks a question, and it never works because the cultural assumptions are so different.", "Hey, not sure where you are from. Here is a german Perspective on that:\n\nThere are some huge issues in the relationship with your husband and your parents. You are very inexperienced (which is not a bad things) romantically. This is because your parents forced you to not Engage in this part of life (which is a bad thing). They apparently only cared for education - why? Were you Set up to be the Sole Provider for your family? To me that sounds fishy. My inner cynic says that they see you just as a means to get money and a son in law and they do not really about you as a Person. But that is so far my cynic, i dont know about your family Dynamik or what is considered normal in your homecountry. Also if arranged marriage is a thing at your home: you married when you were past 30. Isn't that than kinda late? When I hear about these areanged things, the women is often very young in her early twenties. Sounds they also did not really care about that. \n(I am against arranged marriages tbh, but i recognize it is different in other parts of the World. Just think that is a bit odd. But i do not know about your homr, so just being a bit suspicious here). \n\nSo what is the Deal with rome? Is he experienced, or is he also as clueless about marriages and romantics as you? \n\nI think the marriage was a bad idea. Jumping into marriage was very quick after having no Experience at all. If you want to keep trying, you should go with him to a GOOD counselor who knows the modern World (Sounds like your parents are Living in the past while you are in the present) or admit you made a mistake and divorce. If he does not want to work on that with you, you have to get a divorce since this will go downhill. Also you should definititly put down boundaries (also to test him but in the same making you more comfortable): he should not have any access to your Finances. \n\nHere is the worst case scenario: you were being Fished  by a Scammer who realized you were inexperienced (while your parents weren't doing their job) romantically while having a lot of money. Now he is draining you, makes copies of All your documents and will leave you with an empty Bank Account and a Ton of debt. Not saying that this is the case, but the Story smells fishy and it feels like there are some parts missing.\n\nHow is your family life? How do your parents interact with you? Do they still treat you like a kid (you are 35 after all), did they push you around, did they ever care about anything besides education and work? And how is life with your husband. He says he prefers his friends. Why? Does he show you Any affection at all? Do you have Sex? Do you have alone time with him? If you do not see each other anymore you are only married on paper. No reason to keep going. Then divorce. You have money and education, you do not need to care about the Stigma. And there are men who do not give a sh** about you being divorced once - if they are hard to come by in your region maybe pick a men putside the Proverbial and maybe geographical Box;)\n\nNTA and needs more Information\n\nEdit: and before amy of this is sorted out: DO NOT GET PREGNANT! This is very important. Do not throw a child in this mix", "NTA \n\nBut don't have kids OP. You have a weird warped view of the world.", "NTA, divorce Rome and your parents too. You deserve better.", "NTA - as something is not right in the state of Denmark\n\nI'm more curious as to why your sixth sense reflex is kicking off?\n\nIt sounds like you married an immature young man who was gunning for your money.\n\nYou don't want to divorce but are willing to pull the financial plug on your parents?\n\nI think you need to address the state of your marriage.\n\n> I didn\u2019t want a divorce. I thought we could live our separate lives just like normal. It worked well until the past couple of months. Rome has become very nosy about me and my life. It makes me feel uncomfortable. \n\nHas this been directly communicated with your husband or is this something that you decided upon internally to keep face?\n\nI find it suspicious that he is all of a sudden looking to 'charm' the parents instead of you.  What is his end game in doing this?  It as if he is trying to paint a picture that is a figment of reality.  Does he have nefarious plans of some sort? \n\nOP, put a boundary down about asking her directly for the items.  Yet, both he and parents ignore this reasonable request.  Why would he continue?  It's like he doesn't want to spend unnecessary time with her.\n\nOP you are degreed up the wazoo, so is it possible to find a job in a more liberal country and then divorce?\n\nIn any event, you need to hash out with your husband what you both envision for this marriage.  Communicate and see if things improve.  It's odd that he's out partying like he is single.", "NTA. Your marriage situation seems really messy but I am more mad at your parents. In a difficult marriage your parents should have your back. But instead your parents see your husband as the 'golden son' and seem to value him more than you. Also considering the restrictions they raised you with and the way they keep dismissing you asking them to not share stuff makes me think they don't see you as your own independent person. So you really don't have much choice but to take drastic actions like the ultimatum you gave. Don't listen to people calling you an asshole. \n\nIt's not my business but I grew up in  similarly regressive culture where girls are restricted from dating for the most part and divorce is looked down upon. I have seen stories like your marriage and much worse everywhere around me. Almost everyone in my generation wishes our parents divorced. Trust me, sometimes culture is not worth your life and your possible future kids lives. Life in a marriage that isn't working will never get better. Idk the full details so maybe your situation can be improved by taking more drastic actions like your ultimatum. But I have also seen people in my very regressive culture also divorcing and managing to find a new partner though with difficulty. Either way it's an uphill journey. All I can say is stay strong and your worth is not determined by your relationship status. Even if everyone around you thinks that way.", "To be honest, both your husband AND your parents sound like they deserve to be divorced from you, as it sounds both just want your money and don't respect your boundaries. Your parents kept sending husband your stuff, but husband also kept asking them for stuff when you specifically asked him to go through you from now on.\n\nYour entire message sounds like there is no love nor respect nor communication in this marriage. Do you even know why he is so interested in you all of a sudden after what sounds like a long time of disinterest?\n\nNTA at all - but everyone around you is. I understand that this may be a cultural thing, but please revaluate your family and put yourself first.", "Why does he want your thesis?", "You better hope your parents aren\u2019t giving him your social security number and personal info that could allow him to open up credit cards in your name. NTA but you seem to like being oppressed if you don\u2019t see how scary this situation could be for your future.", "NTA for telling them off but lady, you have Stockholm syndrome. Please go see a counselor to help you recognize what's going on and help build a backbone that your parents didnt instill in you unfortunately.", "This woman needs a divorce from both this man and her AH parents. What are they doing sending these photos and her thesis to him? Who actually does that without their child\u2019s permission?", "I understand that this may be a cultural thing, but please revaluate your family and put yourself first.", "When someone is extending the 'charm' on third parties when it should be shown at home would give me the shivers.", "A divorce doesn't need a justification other that \"I no longer want to be married to this person\"", "if you respect yourself you will leave him\u2026", "He has done A LOT wrong! Please, grow a backbone and see your value. This guy thinks that all he has to do is exist and put his name on a marriage certificate. He is making zero contribution to the marriage, spending YOUR money, going behind your back with your parents breaking your boundaries. How TF do you still think he hasn't done anything wrong?", "It is suspicious.\n\nIt's more like he's 'charming' the parents.\n\nIt reads like he is weaving a web of deceit.\n\nAll the things that he asked for could have been asked for directly from OP and be a getting to know you and bonding type dealy.  Instead he circumvents OP, not wanting to really interact with her but does so with her parents to make it look like he is so very interested in their daughter.\n\nWhen someone is extending the 'charm' on third parties when it should be shown at home would give me the shivers.", "You haven't had any romantic experiences before him. Normally, your husband would already know all of these things about your life because both of you have talked and enjoy sharing your histories and this is not considered nosy. It's a little weird that he's communicating with your parents only. But even stranger that he knows so little about the woman he married.\n\ndo you know anything about his childhood, school, etc?", "Because it\u2019s *weird*. You\u2019ve chosen to marry someone whom you won\u2019t even share your masters thesis with? If we were reading this from Rome\u2019s perspective I\u2019m sure OP would seem as controlling as her parents.

Totally fine if that\u2019s a choice you made. But why are you funding your parents when they don\u2019t respect your requests?", "What you described you want is dating. Casual dating.\n\nThat's not a marriage. In marriage you intertwine every aspect of your lives together, legally, socially, and financially.

And then says all was fine until he was nosy. \n\nI was expecting to find that he was sneaking behind her back and breaking into passwords, not asking for pictures! This is just odd.", "The whole thing is strange. Why does he want these photos and thesis? What are his motives here?

Spending time together and enjoying each others company is the basis of most marriages, not something to be unrealistic about.", "Also, please cut Rome's access to **YOUR** money. It's yours, not his. \n\nAnd please consider separation/ divorce. It's not shameful, regardless of what you've been raised to believe. It's simply the natural end of a relationship; you just have to sign a piece of paper rather than making a clean break without the legalities. \n\nYour parents deserve to be cut off and I truly believe you should follow through with your ultimatum because they've already proved they don't have any qualms about betraying your trust.\n\nYou don't \\*have\\* to do what's expected of you.

Now you're upset he is spending more time with you and is interested in who you were as a kid, and your master thesis (a huge accomplishment)?  I'm confused, it feels like you are moving the goalposts on him and blaming him.", "The financial drain depends where they live.
