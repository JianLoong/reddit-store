Is he going to your parents because he doesn't feel like you are open with him? You sound very closed off. This sounds like an arranged marriage type of situation, which I don't have a lot of experience with. But spouses should be warm and caring with each other, want to know all about each other, want to spend time together, etc... Why don't you sit down together and have a talk about what he wants to know and why. And why he's going to your parents instead of you. Communication is very important.", "This feels like one of those times when someone from a non-Western background asks a question, and it never works because the cultural assumptions are so different.", "Hey, not sure where you are from. Here is a german Perspective on that:\n\nThere are some huge issues in the relationship with your husband and your parents. You are very inexperienced (which is not a bad things) romantically. This is because your parents forced you to not Engage in this part of life (which is a bad thing). They apparently only cared for education - why? Were you Set up to be the Sole Provider for your family? To me that sounds fishy. My inner cynic says that they see you just as a means to get money and a son in law and they do not really about you as a Person. But that is so far my cynic, i dont know about your family Dynamik or what is considered normal in your homecountry. Also if arranged marriage is a thing at your home: you married when you were past 30. Isn't that than kinda late? When I hear about these areanged things, the women is often very young in her early twenties. Sounds they also did not really care about that. \n(I am against arranged marriages tbh, but i recognize it is different in other parts of the World. Just think that is a bit odd. But i do not know about your homr, so just being a bit suspicious here). \n\nSo what is the Deal with rome? Is he experienced, or is he also as clueless about marriages and romantics as you? \n\nI think the marriage was a bad idea. Jumping into marriage was very quick after having no Experience at all. If you want to keep trying, you should go with him to a GOOD counselor who knows the modern World (Sounds like your parents are Living in the past while you are in the present) or admit you made a mistake and divorce. If he does not want to work on that with you, you have to get a divorce since this will go downhill. Also you should definititly put down boundaries (also to test him but in the same making you more comfortable): he should not have any access to your Finances. \n\nHere is the worst case scenario: you were being Fished  by a Scammer who realized you were inexperienced (while your parents weren't doing their job) romantically while having a lot of money. Now he is draining you, makes copies of All your documents and will leave you with an empty Bank Account and a Ton of debt. Not saying that this is the case, but the Story smells fishy and it feels like there are some parts missing.\n\nHow is your family life? How do your parents interact with you? Do they still treat you like a kid (you are 35 after all), did they push you around, did they ever care about anything besides education and work? And how is life with your husband. He says he prefers his friends. Why? Does he show you Any affection at all? Do you have Sex? Do you have alone time with him? If you do not see each other anymore you are only married on paper. No reason to keep going. Then divorce. You have money and education, you do not need to care about the Stigma. And there are men who do not give a sh** about you being divorced once - if they are hard to come by in your region maybe pick a men putside the Proverbial and maybe geographical Box;)\n\nNTA and needs more Information\n\nEdit: and before amy of this is sorted out: DO NOT GET PREGNANT!
