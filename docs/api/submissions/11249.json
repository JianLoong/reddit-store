I allow them Social Media but i look at it all the time because well.... they're in 5th grade. \n\nA few nights ago, a child, we'll call him Ben (11m) sent a snap of himself vaping. I saw it (it was a video and a real vape) and didn't say anything to my kid yet, but decided i would keep a close eye on anything having to do with Ben. I also planned to have a discussion with my child about vaping very soon. \n\nThe other morning, the kids were scheduled for a field trip. I checked my kid's snaps and saw a discussion where Ben was planning to bring this vape onto the bus to the field trip destination. He was trying to convince my kid's best friend to sit with him. \n\nI saw it right before the kids went to school. I was so worried about this vape getting onto a bus with 5th graders during their school day, that i called the school to give them a heads up. I know this will cause drama but i was really worried about one of the kids trying it and getting sick, not even realizing what they were doing. Also, i knew if this kid was caught using it on the bus he likely wouldn't be the only one getting in trouble. The principal said they would keep it anonymous who called so my child wouldn't get targeted. \n\nI don't know his parents either so there was no way for me to give them a friendly heads up about this in any way. \n\nMy friend thinks i went too far by calling the school. Another friend said it was the right thing to do, but i'm having a lot of guilt over this now. I don't know the outcome of Ben being approached yet, but these kids have been pretty quiet on snap now.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to correct spelling.", "created_utc": 1677706702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fixmu/aita_for_calling_my_childs_principal/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why wouldn't you report it?", "NTA.

Idk what kind of parent lets their 5th grade kid vape anyways", "NTA - This is a safety concern and these are children who absolutely cannot consent to those kinds of things. If your kid was an older teen it would be different. But honestly how did an 11yr old get a vape? Vaping is way worse when your young and still growing.", "Im going to NTA, youre actions are of genuine care and worry for kids safery. Youre not trying to get a kid in trouble to get in trouble. Buddy shouldnt have a vape in the first place, and should know the rules to not bring it to school.", "I'm going with NTA\n\nMost likely it's an older sibling's vape pen that they're using.

The internet is a dangerous place. It's fantastic that you monitor them but there have been study upon study showing that social media causes depression/anxiety in most people but especially kids/teenagers. There's also horrible people out there that target kids on social media.\n\nI know it's tough because of peer pressure and all that- but in my professional opinion it is not worth it. However had you not allowed your child social media you wouldn't have caught the vape thing. It's so hard these days you can't ever win!\n\n\nKeep being an awesome parent OP!", "NTA. And as a teacher, I\u2019d like to say thank you for doing this. Imagine if the child was vaping on the bus or at the trip destination and that information got out to the public. The teacher in charge of supervising the trip would definitely be in trouble - could be disciplined or, if the teacher is in probationary position, be fired.

You did the right thing.", "NTA - but wtf is your kid doing on Snapchat, I thought the age minimum was 13? Half the reason kids do dumb shit like this is for attention on SM.", "NTA - You did what any rational concerned parent would do. Keep your kid and the others away from it and you had no one else to tell.", "NTA, I would have done the same thing.  Hopefully the principal has a chat with the parents about vaping and not keeping an eye on kiddo's socials.", "NTA. You involved the school because this was occurring at school so the school needed to be involved. You absolutely did the right thing. I find it hard to believe anyone would disagree with that.

I don't want vaping done near my kis either.", "NTA you did the right thing", "NTA by a comfortable margin, you did the exact right thing.", "My only question is, why did you let it go so far?", "Your child shouldn't have social media. That's what the principal should deal with. You shouldn't be able to spy on other children in the class because you shouldn't have the account. The agreement is that the user is 13 or over, not under 13 with adult supervision.", "NTA...this is a major thing. You don't know what is in that vape for one. For two just no! No way a 5th grader should be doing that. I'd get pissed at my 8th graders when I confiscated theirs because they are too damn young.", "NTA. Vaping is actually worse than cigarettes!", "NTA. If I was the parent of the little vaper, I\u2019d want to know. You most likely did them a favour as well.", "NTA, kids that age should not have access to nicotine products, and it\u2019s absolutely not okay for them to be sharing it either. You did the right thing and hopefully the school actually does something about it.", "NTA, what were you supposed to do, let little kids pass a nicotine product around on a field trip? I teach at a middle school and the kids who vape are often addicted and need to get caught to get the help they need to stop using it. A kid dropped a vape pen on the floor as he was entering my classroom, and I was telling his teachers and every single one said the same thing, thank goodness because he really needs support.", "YTA because you should have spoken with your son about this first. Your son might have been more involved with this than you realize, and may be penalized. You should have spoken to him first and made sure he does not have any vaping stuff, does not vape, and stays away from those kids.\n\nCalling the Principal is the right thing to do, but you should have ensured your son's safety first.", "Or, er, Snapchat, in my opinion", "The other common use of vaping is THC/CBD (Pot). It should be noted that this is location specific, though, and usually limited to places where it's legal in one form or another.\n\nOP- NTA", "If only it were just nicotine!  As unregulated products there can be literally ANYTHING in it.", "My guess is from an older sibling or friend", "Right that's where I struggle. I see what's going on in situations like this because i allow them on SM and read it. I know SM can be awful too. I just remember how dangerous behavior and bullying used to go undetected in my day because everyone did it via written letters and while adults had their backs turned. It's such a double edged sword.", "I thought of that also, it wouldn't be fair to the school.", "It's legal here.", "It is. I really dislike Snapchat because everything disappears. That definitely encourages kids to send things they know.they shouldn't because it's \"a secret\". \n\nThat being said there are ways to get old snaps (via digital forensics) so if you think it's best you allow your kid to continue Snapchat- I think it's definitely important they understand it's not erased forever. It might help them make better choices. \n\nIt is totally a double edged sword. You're damned if you do damned if you don't. You know your child best, so keep doing what you think is best!", "So this makes you doubly NTA.\n\nBoth types of vape are a legitimate concern. I do recommend a little less information sharing with the friend who thought you went too far, but that's obviously your call.", "Not legal for an 11 year old though.", "Yeah. I do talk to them all the time about how nothing you send via text or SM is actually private. Even phone conversations aren't private because it's so easy for someone to record them. Also they're required to keep their chat settings on won't delete for 24 hours. But i know they can still delete single messages. I look at it a few times a day. None of this is perfect. I'm definitely not perfect.", "Not to throw a wrench. I don\u2019t disagree, but you can get non-nicotine/non-thc vape. I still agree children should. Not be vaping.", "No i just mean it's easily accessible here so it very well could have been in the vape.", "You're awesome. Keep it up! Sorry other parents suck and don't watch their kids and let them send vaping videos to their classmates -_-.", "NTA. YOUR child being possibly drug into the vaping due to peer pressure takes precedent over the little tow head you turned in.", "op=NTA\n\nvaping is so not acceptable for 5th graders.", "NTA. As a teacher, I would very much appreciate this heads up.", "I ain\u2019t gonna give a judgement, but if I had a vape as a 5th grader and my parents knew, whooping would be the least of my issues.", "NTA. These are 10 or 11 year olds. Jfc. Have the talk with your kid about smoking and vaping now. There's 0 reason to put it off.", "NTA. As a junior in high school, vaping is a serious issue. a fifth grader doesn\u2019t need to vape, they don\u2019t need to be bringing that vape onto a bus of other fifth graders, and they ESPECIALLY don\u2019t need to be trying to convince other fifth graders to vape. It\u2019s a very real concern, and even if the kid was just vaping and didn\u2019t being it on the bus or try to convince others, you wouldn\u2019t be TA for calling the school. The parents need to be notified. Nicotine and addiction is very real, and 11 year olds don\u2019t need to be apart of that.", "NTA \n\nYou did the right thing. The principal knows to keep it anonymous. You are in the clear!", "An 11 year old has a vape? So he was trying to share either nicotine or THC, both of which is startlingly illegal for a child to have or be sharing, NTA this is just decent parenting", "Nta. You are looking out for all kids best interests. We didn't have vapes when I was in school. Kids smuggled in cigarettes and weed in 7th grade all the time. When they are so young they have no real grasp of the long term damage they are doing. Nicotine addiction is freaken brutal. Kids don't view vapes the same way they do cigarettes and are less concerned about trying it. I think you have handled it well.", "NTA. I teach kids this age and we would be so upset if a parent knew this was going to happen and didn't say anything.", " NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour child, not theirs. Your call, not hers.\n\nI am curious why you asked their advice. If you really weren't sure, you could have asked them before the call to the school.\n\nI think you did just fine.", "Yes! I second this. Not all social media is bad, but snapchat seems especially dangerous for young kids.", "It doesn't throw a wrench, so I'm not fussed. \n\nJust because the types of vapes mentioned thus far are the most common doesn't negate the existence of other types. In this instance, my use of the term \"both\" was a specific to the forms that had already been discussed.", "NTA I\u2019m literally writing an anonymous letter to my kid\u2019s school administrators over a similar issue.", "Absolutely NTA! Someone needs to step in. You are correct that other children can be injured by this. How did a 5th grader get a hold of vape? No doubt the school will find the pen and inform the parents. You did not do this to be mean, but as a concerned parent. Good for you!"]}
