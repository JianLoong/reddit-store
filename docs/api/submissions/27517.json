A few years before I met my husband ( 2 I think) he briefly dated this girl but ended the relationship because he wasn't interested in her. She then started dating his best friend and ultimately married him. Now I've never been concerned that he still talks to her, however when we first started dating she made things incredibly AWKWARD. Any time she could bring up her relationship with my husband she would even in front of her husband. It was irritating but I put up with it for my husband's friends sake. I didn't want my husband (then bf) to not have a friendship with him over her actions. Well a couple years ago she ended up divorcing my husband's friend. And we hadn't seen much of her since until a couple days ago.\n\nMy husband and I were grocery shopping when he went to go grab something from a different aisle. I continued the shopping but he never came back so I went to go find him. I found him in a random aisle talking to said ex. I walked up and told him I was done shopping so I was going to get in line and I walked away. When I got to the truck he was there waiting for me and semes visibly upset and asked why I was so rude. I was confused and said \"what do you mean?\" He then told me I was being a petty asshole for not acknowledging her presence. I wanted to laugh thinking about the years of awkwardness caused from her bringing up their relationship any chance she could (even bringing up their sex life) but simply just said \" she's not MY friend so why would I say hi?\" And it was dropped. But now he's being cold towards me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I saw a very good comment about ex making me uncomfortable. So I'd like to add here, my husband was fully aware of how she made me uncomfortable. It was talked about when we were no longer in her company many times, because it even made him uncomfortable. So this isn't a case of he didn't know all those years ago she made me feel uncomfortable with her actions. He knew and he agreed. It's also why I was a little taken aback with him being so upset I didn't say hi.", "created_utc": 1695532597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qp69i/aita_for_not_saying_hi_to_my_husbands_ex/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You literally don't have to talk to any person if you don't want to, but particularly anyone who makes you uncomfortable.  This is such a \"women should always be polite\" type response, which can be so damaging.", "NTA. You have no obligation to chat with an ex. I guess you could be cordial if you wish but at the end of the day you're uncomfortable with her and probably don't have anything nice to say to her. Your husband should respect that, tbh.", "NTA for being rude. There's a difference between being impolite and being an AH. You don't have to be polite to people you don't like. Husband being cold because you didn't say hi to someone at the grocery store is a red flag. He shouldn't care so much about her.", "YTA. First of all to yourself. She made all of those awkward comments to annoy you and now she knows she managed to get on your nerves because you could not bring yourself to even say hi. \n\nYou went away sulking like a toddler, she probably thinks you\u2019re jealous of her and enjoys the thought.\n\nA softer YTA, this one for your lack of manners. Ok, you don\u2019t have to talk to people you don\u2019t like, but you could have at least said Hi. I\u2019m sorry if we disagree here, maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, as I am from the UK.\n\nEdit:typos.", "I don\u2019t say hi to anyone who dated my ex after we broke up. What\u2019s the point?

He's a big boy, he can hear your feelings and decide how to not let that affect his friendship with her husband by himself. \n\nSince you never mentioned it before, it comes off a bit petty and immature, to act that way out of nowhere.\n\nAlso, it implies you felt threatened about his and her relationship. He may expect that if you trusted him, you'd be more gracious or even oblivious to any threat from her.\n\nOr you seem insincere in pretending to be friends with her before, and now ignoring her.", "YTA. It\u2019s not a huge deal but it was rude.", "YTA.\n\nYou couldn't even say \"Hi, ex\" and then tell your husband what you needed to say ? How rude.", "YTA.\n\nThis woman is living rent-free in your head, and you just confirmed that to her by being rude. \n\nShe's an acquaintance. If she was someone from work you'd met a few times but didn't really like and you saw her in that context, you say \"Hi _____\". \n\nIn this context, what you did was blatant, rude, and unnecessary. You don't have to treat her like your long lost BFF. Just say hello. If I was your husband I'd be embarrassed and pissed too.\n\nManners exist for a reason - to give us a socially appropriate set of things to do so we don't upset people and send the wrong message. Because by observing manners, the only message we send is that we know how to act in public.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As well as you commenting that I should have brought it up in the past that she made me uncomfortable, well it was brought up lots because she even made my husband uncomfortable with her nonsense.
