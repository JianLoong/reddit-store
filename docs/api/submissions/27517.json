A few years before I met my husband ( 2 I think) he briefly dated this girl but ended the relationship because he wasn't interested in her. She then started dating his best friend and ultimately married him. Now I've never been concerned that he still talks to her, however when we first started dating she made things incredibly AWKWARD. Any time she could bring up her relationship with my husband she would even in front of her husband. It was irritating but I put up with it for my husband's friends sake. I didn't want my husband (then bf) to not have a friendship with him over her actions. Well a couple years ago she ended up divorcing my husband's friend. And we hadn't seen much of her since until a couple days ago.\n\nMy husband and I were grocery shopping when he went to go grab something from a different aisle. I continued the shopping but he never came back so I went to go find him. I found him in a random aisle talking to said ex. I walked up and told him I was done shopping so I was going to get in line and I walked away. When I got to the truck he was there waiting for me and semes visibly upset and asked why I was so rude. I was confused and said \"what do you mean?\" He then told me I was being a petty asshole for not acknowledging her presence. I wanted to laugh thinking about the years of awkwardness caused from her bringing up their relationship any chance she could (even bringing up their sex life) but simply just said \" she's not MY friend so why would I say hi?\" And it was dropped. But now he's being cold towards me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I saw a very good comment about ex making me uncomfortable. So I'd like to add here, my husband was fully aware of how she made me uncomfortable. It was talked about when we were no longer in her company many times, because it even made him uncomfortable. So this isn't a case of he didn't know all those years ago she made me feel uncomfortable with her actions. He knew and he agreed. It's also why I was a little taken aback with him being so upset I didn't say hi.", "created_utc": 1695532597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qp69i/aita_for_not_saying_hi_to_my_husbands_ex/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You literally don't have to talk to any person if you don't want to, but particularly anyone who makes you uncomfortable.

I guess you could be cordial if you wish but at the end of the day you're uncomfortable with her and probably don't have anything nice to say to her. Your husband should respect that, tbh.", "NTA for being rude. There's a difference between being impolite and being an AH. You don't have to be polite to people you don't like. Husband being cold because you didn't say hi to someone at the grocery store is a red flag. He shouldn't care so much about her.", "YTA. First of all to yourself. She made all of those awkward comments to annoy you and now she knows she managed to get on your nerves because you could not bring yourself to even say hi. \n\nYou went away sulking like a toddler, she probably thinks you\u2019re jealous of her and enjoys the thought.\n\nA softer YTA, this one for your lack of manners. Ok, you don\u2019t have to talk to people you don\u2019t like, but you could have at least said Hi.

If she was someone from work you'd met a few times but didn't really like and you saw her in that context, you say \"Hi _____\". \n\nIn this context, what you did was blatant, rude, and unnecessary. You don't have to treat her like your long lost BFF. Just say hello. If I was your husband I'd be embarrassed and pissed too.\n\nManners exist for a reason - to give us a socially appropriate set of things to do so we don't upset people and send the wrong message.

Ignore and walk away..", "Nta. You dont have to say hi to them. If you  want to that\u2019s your choice. I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to this person if they talked about sleeping with my husband to my face either", "NTA.\n\nWhy exactly did you marry someone who was like \"yeah that's uncomfortable but whatevs\" instead of actually saying something about it to *his* friend?\n\nThere's something weird going on here.", "Whoa, my antenna would be up. What is he so upset about? Why is this worth fighting over? You are NTA. But I'd be wondering A LOT about his reaction here.\n\nIs he still friends with the guy she was married to?", "NTA and why does your husband suddenly care knowing FULL WELL what that woman put you through??? Shady AF just saying. I\u2019d be sitting him down and talking to him because that\u2019s sus", "I see your point. Normally I am a very polite person and say hi to people, even other exes of his . But I honestly just don't have the time of day for someone who is not only disrespectful towards me, but also her own husband (nowex)", "For context, I never pretended to be friends with her before. Id say hi when she came around with her ex husband and that's it. As well as you commenting that I should have brought it up in the past that she made me uncomfortable, well it was brought up lots because she even made my husband uncomfortable with her nonsense. It was no secret to my husband that I wasn't her biggest fan because of her actions and only tolerated her because of her husband. .", "But I appreciate your opinion", "Well the ex was rude to op for years. If she wanta to be rude with others she should take others being rude to her too.", "Womp womp", "Ah so you had always been clear with him that you don't consider her a friend and you only put up with her as she's married to his friend, for his sake? In that case, I don't understand why he would be mad now. It's consistent that now she's not with him, you would no longer put up with her.", "I would be very cautious of this woman, she has shown before she enjoys getting one over on you, making it known she has slept with your husband is a power move for sure, now she\u2019s single\u2026..watch out girl. Your husband should not be taking her part.", "NTA but please update us when your hubby comes clean on exactly what type of tree branch is stuck in his sphincter\nI'm betting it's not yew, it's him \ud83d\ude02", "Would he have preferred you were all high handed and bitchy with her? I mean, most parents tell their children \u201cif you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong. In the future, if you see her again you can always set a timer on your phone for like 2min with your ring tone and use the \u201ccall\u201d as an excuse to leave. Then you can\u2019t be accused of \u201cnot being polite enough\u201d to some sloppy seconds.", "NTA but why is he defending her poor feelings? Be wary of her now that she is single again.", "Nta- But how much talking do they do behind your back? Any messenging on the socials? Did he ever actually find her comments unwanted, or was he just saying that? It's weird and suspicious to be cold to you for being rude to her when she's been rude to you the entire time. And he's never been told her to knock it off, or he'll cut her off? He's never been like \"hey stop disrespecting my relationship by talking about how we use to date. It's in the past, soo over, and embarrassing. It also makes you look like you havent moved on.\"? Why does she deserve you and your husband's attention? Your partner is supposed to back you up, not try and make you bend to her when he knows how you feel.", "NTA. I'd be real watchful of those two from now on though & see if there're any changes in hubby's behavior because it's real suspect that he's being cold to you over her.", "Your Husband is the AH.  He didn't forget that she was how she was. He was basking in her attention! Then, because he KNOWS he was basking he tries to appease his guilty conscious by blaming YOU for not saying hello. OP you are NTA.", "I would just tell him I'm not going to be put on the defense against his ex in whatever drama he has going on in his mind right now. End of discussion. NTA", "Something fucky is going on.", "I don't know if this makes you the AH, but I think it's bad idea to give her the satisfaction of getting under your skin. She's the type to enjoy it, and it's caused a rift between you and your husband, which she will enjoy, too. Also, she can play victim to your husband - \"Why didn't your wife say hi to me? What did poor little me do?\"", "NTA\nHE is upset at YOU because you WOULDN'T chummy up to his ex . Point out the irony love", "NTA\n\nBut I think you made yourself look bad and maybe thays what your husband is annoyed about. Had you simply said \"oh hi ...\" and then told your husband whatever you needed to say, it would've been more graceful. But by not doing that and openly ignoring her, you made her feel like she occupied a more important place in your life than she actually does.", "YTA I hate this petty bullshit. This girl could be the devil\u2019s child but at least be civil. Acknowledge her presence. You making a point just gives her your power. If you don\u2019t believe me, think about how your husband is upset with you. If you had said, \u201cHi ex. Husband I am going to the checkout. Bye Ex,\u201d then everyone would have gone their own way with no drama. You would have kept your power.", "Is this the same husband who left you alone when you were in the last month of pregnancy to go drinking? Your post from two years ago said he left basically every night and you thought he might be cheating. Is this the same time this woman and his bff got divorced?", "So I know it seems weird. But here's a little more context. He says he hates confrontation so he never said anything. Poor excuse I know. And although this was one of his best friends, we actually didn't see them often because we kind of lived two different lifestyles at the time. So it was only maybe 10-12 times a year we saw them and eventually dropped to 3-4 times a year.", "Oh please!!!", "you're adorable; i love it ;)", "Oh damn I really hope OP replies cause I also want to know now"]}
