That image, those details are forever engraved on my mind and I'll never forget how I felt that day. This was truly a turning point in my life. My family have always been there for me so I kept close to them.\n\n\nMy younger sister is currently engaged and her wedding will be in few months. She's struggling with money so I decided to help her and her fiance and pay the wedding dress. This allowed her to be able to buy her dream wedding gown that costs 7,000 ($). It's a lot for a dress but she literally cried because she wanted it.\n\n\n(This happened few days before we agreed to go buy the dress). We were eating dinner at my parents home and my cousin and aunt were there.  My aunt was asking my sister about the wedding and my sister said that everything was going according to plan and then casually laughed and said \"let's just hope he won't ran away with a pregnant mistress or something in our wedding day..\". I was blown away completely. She laughed and aunt laughed too as if this was a joke. She was basically mocking what happened with me in my wedding. It happened so fast I got up and started screaming at her calling her an idiot but my parents asked me to take it easy and she said it was a joke and she didn't \"think\" I'd react so intensely. My aunt remained seated and my cousin asked me to calm down and drink somd water but I grabbed my stuff and as I was getting ready, I told my sister she was getting 0 dollars for her dream wedding dress then I walked out. I heard louder commotion as I walked and my dad and cousin followed me outside trying to talk but I asked to be left alone.\n\n\nMy and dad spoke to saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke and said that I know this is how she is with her dark sense of humor. They said she's been crying after I decided to back out of helping her and said this'd ruin her wedding. They want me to reconsider my decision since it might damage my relationship with my sister but I refused.\n\nDid I overreact?\n\nInfo: it's my aunt that would usually brings up what happened from time to time and say stuff like \"if what happened didn't happen you would've had at least 2 kids now\" or \"do you know what day it is? your wedding anniversary !\" It's harsh but she stopped doing it anymore. Maybe my sister is being influenced by her but still. It hurt the same, and more coming from my own sister.", "created_utc": 1685538610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wlw9z/aita_for_backing_out_of_paying_for_my_sisters/", "score": 665, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These people are supposed to be your family and care about you.  Your duster seems to only care about a dress more than apologizing to you.  The rest are saying you are being too dramatic?!  I think being jilted at the altar, someone \u201cjoking\u201d about it, calls for some drama.   You are not the one ruining the close bond you have with your sister or your family.  They all are.

I understand the trauma and I'm sorry that it happened, and it's not something they should joke about. But it was also one comment and you immediately exploded and lashed out back at her. Again, justified, maybe. But unfortunately, fair or not, you need to get to a healthy place where you can deal with comments like that with a more level head. People make shitty comments and jokes like that, and they don't always mean to be shitty or realize they're doing it. \n\nBlowing up at her and storming out was a lot.

That image, those details are forever engraved on my mind and I'll never forget how I felt that day. This was truly a turning point in my life. My family have always been there for me so I kept close to them.\n\n\nMy younger sister is currently engaged and her wedding will be in few months. She's struggling with money so I decided to help her and her fiance and pay the wedding dress. This allowed her to be able to buy her dream wedding gown that costs 7,000 ($). It's a lot for a dress but she literally cried because she wanted it.\n\n\n(This happened few days before we agreed to go buy the dress). We were eating dinner at my parents home and my cousin and aunt were there.  My aunt was asking my sister about the wedding and my sister said that everything was going according to plan and then casually laughed and said \"let's just hop he won't ran away with a pregnant mistress or something in our wedding day..\". I was blow away completely. She laughed and aunt laughed too as if this was a joke. She was basically mocking what happened with me in my wedding. It happened so fast I got up and started screaming at her calling her an idiot but my parents asked me to take it easy and she said it was a joke and she didn't \"think\" I'd react so intensely. My aunt remained seated and my cousin asked me to calm down and drink somd water but I grabbed my stuff and as I was getting ready, I told my sister she was getting 0 dollars for her dream wedding dress then I walked out. I heard louder commotion as I walked and my dad and cousin followed me outside trying to talk but I asked to be left alone.\n\n\nMy and dad spoke to saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke and said that I know this is how she is with her dark sense of humor. They said she's been crying after I decided to back out of helping her and said this'd ruin her wedding. They want me to reconsider my decision since it might damage my relationship with my sister but I refused.\n\nDid I overreact?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I could definitely see the humor if OP herself had told this joke, but her sister??", "My first instinct was... like, I'm not going to call OP an AH for it but it does seem like an overly harsh consequence for a misjudgment of what can be joked about. You're completely right that I wouldn't understand how life altering that sort of event would be, but the sister might not either. I think it's obnoxious that the dad and cousin downplayed it - the immediate response from everyone should have been to apologize and *gently* ask for forgiveness. But it also doesn't sound like it was meant to be mocking as the OP perceived it.\n\nIt obviously wasn't okay, and my mental jury is out on whether the sister is an AH depending on whether she expresses real contrition for the error or makes it about herself - but in general I feel like a brief moment of misjudgment like that shouldn't have to have irreversible consequences if the person does their best to mend it.", "Impact over intent. I don\u2019t know what they were thinking, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable for her to assume that that joke would have landed at all - that\u2019s the problem.
