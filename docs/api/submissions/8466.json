This issue is about my daughter, Allie (26F).  She is very upset with me because I am going to allow my niece, Victoria (29F) to hold her wedding at my beach home (rental property).

My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.\n\nSo to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fianc\u00e9 called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.  \n\nI was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn\u2019t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her. \n\nMy niece has had a tough life due to her mother\u2019s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if her wedding wasn\u2019t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.\n\nThe way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father.

Like, subconsciously, if she can just get married there before anyone else has major events, then she will have recovered from this setback, but if her niece gets to use it first, she'll be permanently behind and the loss will feel all the more significant.

You are her mom and she is just expressing how she feels and she is feeling safe to say this to you. That being said, stick to your guns and she will come around even though it will be very hard for her. It is life. It isn't fair. But no one here is TA. \nGive her a hug and be there for her. And let your neice have her day as well. \nHope it turns out OK.", "Your daughter needs to get over herself.\n\nNTA - it's a generous gesture and it's not actually hurting your daughter. If she's so cut up by the thought, she needs counselling to deal with the situation.", "\u201cif I can\u2019t use it, no-one can\u201d there\u2019s a name for your daughter. NTA", "NTA. \n\nI kind of get where your daughter is coming from. Her Dad's house, first wedding there should be hers. But she isn't getting married first. And as painful as that is for her, it's a simple reality.  She's going through something difficult, I hope she's getting proper support.", "NTA, even without this house being intended as a joint family investment, this is clearly a case of your daughter blowing things out of proportion.\n\nIt's been 2-3 months since the wedding was called off, your daughter should have processed her feelings more than this by now, not saying any kind of negative reaction is bad but rather this amount is not ok for this particular matter, she is ether not processing the break up or is showing how self centred she is. Ether case she could use some help from some professional.\n\nI'm sorry your daughter is still reeling from the break up and more so she is attacking you in this matter.", "NTA. Sounds like daughter is just venting because her fiancee left her. She'll get over it.", "NTA it would be easy to talk shit about your daughters behavior but honestly her issue is so unreasonable it\u2019s understandable. She\u2019s just projecting negative feelings on a situation that doesn\u2019t actually have anything to do with her. It seems like she feels more claim to the estate than her other family members. Which is also a reasonable assumption considering you\u2019re her mother but nonetheless very much wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like a lovely human.", "NTA your daughter quite frankly is being unreasonable", "I mean, maybe, but that\u2019s kind of a leap."]}
