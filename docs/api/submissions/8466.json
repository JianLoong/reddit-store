This issue is about my daughter, Allie (26F).  She is very upset with me because I am going to allow my niece, Victoria (29F) to hold her wedding at my beach home (rental property). This is a rather large home and it has a pool and private beach access, which is the main selling feature of the home as a venue. I do vacation rentals and event rentals in the home. \n\nI want to add that I am not a wealthy person and this property is used as a source of income so I will explain how I purchased it because it is relevant.  My father was not a good man. He was especially terrible to my sister, Carol (57F), and my mom (deceased). He was okay with my brother (55M) and me for some reason. Well, it would turn out that my father had money, we are not sure where it all came from but when he died, he left it all to me.  He explicitly left my sister who has had ongoing addiction issues and my brother because he is gay (Another story). I decided to purchase the home and set up a business. My sister and brother are not involved but they have free access to the home when it is not in use and I use some of the profits to help my sister and will send my brother a check yearly.\n\nSo to the issue, Allie was supposed to get married in May but her fianc\u00e9 called off the wedding in November and she is devastated (I really do feel for her).  She was going to use the home and we were even doing some renovations to get it ready. Victoria got engaged in December and last week Victoria called and asked if she would be able to use the home in September and I said of course. When I talked to my daughter last night I mentioned this and she flipped out.  \n\nI was really shocked at her reaction but she said I am rubbing salt in the wound by allowing her cousin to steal her wedding venue. She went on and on about how she should be the first wedding there (she isn\u2019t, there is one the week before her now-canceled wedding).  She said she will not attend because she will be suffering the whole time knowing it should have been her. \n\nMy niece has had a tough life due to her mother\u2019s issues and I know providing her with a venue would allow her to have a wedding she would not otherwise be able to afford, which I tried to explain to Allie.  She said I am picking my niece over her and I pointed out that I would have let my niece use it even if Allie got married there. She said it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if her wedding wasn\u2019t canceled. But I should have compassion for her the way I do for my niece.\n\nThe way I see it is that my siblings and I should have equally inherited from our father. I chose not to alter the estate because I didn\u2019t trust my sister with all that money but her daughter should benefit from the money the same way my daughter can. I try to be as generous as possible with her and her brother but maybe I am going too far.", "created_utc": 1674859132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mycsd/aita_for_allowing_my_niece_to_use_my_daughters/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, what your daughter is going through really sucks, but your neice shouldn't be punished for it. As well, it sounds as if the free access you have extended to your siblings makes her use of it completely valid. Your daughter will come around, I hope.", "NTA. It is awful what your daughter is going through, but that shouldn't make things harder for your niece.", "NTA. I'm sure your daughter is going through a rough time, but she can't claim that property for her wedding when she isn't even engaged anymore. Your daughter probably just needs some time to process, but regardless of the venue, going to her cousin's wedding may be rough on her and she's going to have to try to figure out some coping mechanisms or skip it.", "NTA- your Niece\u2019s wedding is a good 4 months after Allie\u2019s now cancelled wedding was scheduled and close to a year after breakup.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t imagine her upset, it\u2019s not fair for her to expect to people to accommodate her wishes on this.", "NTA- You know what they say, \"... but you can't please ALL the people ALL the time.\" You are in the right here and hopefully your daughter comes to her senses by September.", "NTA - \u201cI\u2019m suffering, so everyone should suffer\u201d is what you\u2019re daughter is really saying. Yes, it\u2019s terrible what happened to her but she\u2019s overreacting. Let her know it\u2019s ok to mourn the loss of her relationship but other people can still have their joy.", "It's ridiculous for her to want weddings banned at the venue until she finds herself a new husband, currently no one's trying to marry her. \n\nShe's being selfish, entitled and very bitter I hope she finds herself some therapy. Don't punish the niece because of your daughter's failed engagement. \n\nYour niece will be very appreciative of your kind gift, hopefully your daughter will be less bitter that far in the future, If not her attendance isn't necessary. Nta", "NTA. I hope your daughter is able to process her distress and grief in due time. You sound incredibly thoughtful so I can see why your daughter\u2019s reaction is upsetting, but it seems more like a reaction about anyone getting married when she is heartbroken. Hope your niece has a beautiful wedding.", "NAH. I can see where your daughter is coming from. It's going to sting to have a family wedding at the place she was supposed to get married, especially as there is likely to a lot of the same people there who a re family. It will be like rubbing salt in the wound to her.\n\nYou're NTA for wanting to help your niece and it is your property, so you get to say how it's used and by who. It's really nice that you want to help your niece, especially after what she has been through.\n\nIt may have been better to have spoken to your daughter before agreeing to your niece. This was she may not have felt blindsided by the situation. She's probably still trying to get over her broken engagement and this has probably opened it up again for her.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is way out of line. You didn't give the home to your niece on your daughter's (now canceled) wedding date. It's months later. Your daughter also doesn't own the rights to be the only person who can get married there. She really isn't making any sense. I understand she is upset at not getting married, but that has nothing to do with your niece.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is going through a hard time, so I hope this is just her pain talking, but she is being unreasonable. The property has always been open to your niece just as much as her, and she doesn't get to prevent anyone from using it just because she won't be the one to use it first. It will be there for her to use when she does get married, but there's no reason not to use it for others in the meantime.\n\nI think, for your daughter, the venue has become more symbolic than anything. Like, subconsciously, if she can just get married there before anyone else has major events, then she will have recovered from this setback, but if her niece gets to use it first, she'll be permanently behind and the loss will feel all the more significant. That's not logical or fair, but if you're trying to get through to her, maybe it will help to come at it from that perspective.", "Nta\n\nYour daughter sure is. I\u2019m Wondering if her behavior isn\u2019t the reason the wedding got cancelled because the entitlement on her stinks.", "NTA.  It's your property so you make the decisions.  I feel bad for your daughter's situation, but she's taking it out on you for no good reason.", "NTA. You are being a decent and practical human being. Your daughter is understandably in great pain, but is also being very unreasonable on this issue. I hope your niece has a wonderful wedding.", "NTA - I think your daughter is being selfish and unfair.  It\u2019s not like the wedding is planned for the exact same date or something.  By saying she should be the first wedding, your daughter is basically asking you to ban years of possible weddings (how soon is she expecting to get engaged again?). It\u2019s not a reasonable request.  Plus she\u2019s being kind of a dick to her cousin.", "NTA. Your daughter is being selfish.", "NTA - how is it \u2018stealing\u2019 when it\u2019s your property, their weddings weren\u2019t even on the same day, and it\u2019s the exact same gesture you had offered to your daughter; it\u2019s not like you were doing something above and beyond for your niece and not your daughter. I feel for her, I really do, but her having her wedding abruptly cancelled doesn\u2019t mean that no one else can have a wedding\u2026 especially months apart\u2026", "NTA\n\nYour daughter thinks everything is about her devastation.
