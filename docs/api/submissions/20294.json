Since then, the TV has sort've become an unspoken free use. \n\nNow, a year later, we are all about a month away from graduating, and the two of us sold it last week. We decided selling it earlier was better because we were both foreign, and thought it'd be better to sell it earlier rather than get stuck with it later when we both move out. \n\nBut this angered the other flatmates, especially one other flatmate (21F), who made lots of snide remarks about how we sold it ove the past week. Today I got upset and spoke to her about it, and she (as a law student) kept bringing up how in divorce the items are split based on usage, not purchase. And since the four of them used it more than the two of us, we should've asked their permission before selling it. \n\nI do feel a little guilty about it, because it's true they used it more than us. And now they won't be able to use it anymore for the month that we're all just chilling here.
