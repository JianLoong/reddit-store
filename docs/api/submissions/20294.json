As the owners, you had the right to decide what to do with it.\r  \n\r  \nUnspoken agreement: While the TV was brought downstairs and used by everyone, it seems that there was no explicit agreement or discussion about ownership or usage rules. This may have created a perception that the TV was a communal item, leading the other flatmates to believe they had a stake in it.\r  \n\r  \nCommunication: It would have been considerate to communicate your intention to sell the TV with the other flatmates, especially if they had come to view it as a shared resource. This could have avoided misunderstandings and allowed them to make alternative arrangements for entertainment.\r  \n\r  \nTiming: Selling the TV a month before graduation, when the other flatmates might have expected to continue using it, may have caused inconvenience and frustration. Considering their expectations and providing them with a chance to find alternative options for entertainment could have been more considerate.\r  \n\r  \nGiven these considerations, it's understandable why the other flatmates, particularly the one who expressed their dissatisfaction, might feel upset about the situation. While you had the right to sell the TV as the owners, it would have been more considerate to communicate your intentions and discuss the situation with the other flatmates before making the decision.\r  \n\r  \nIn summary, it's important to balance individual ownership rights with consideration for the expectations and experiences of others in a shared living space.

Are they deaf, or are you quietly-spoken?", "This is majorly why YTA. I commented separately, but just because something is within your rights to do it doesn't negate it from assholery. You took away something that the people you *live with* enjoy, for cash, without even discussing it with them. \n\nMy judgment stands, YTA.", "It\u2019s not as if they can\u2019t watch tv on their laptops or desktops or phones ffs", "Yeah\u2026that\u2019s not how property is divided at all. It\u2019s either hashed out in the agreement, or it\u2019s 50/50. \n\nLike, when I moved out my ex just said I could take whatever I wanted to.
