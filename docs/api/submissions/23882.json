For example: she has this routine when she gets out of the shower, the cat is sitting in the toilet seat and wants to snuggle and lick water off of her body.\n\nSo, this morning we wake up from a long night of drinking and conversation and I see that the cat is laying on her chest purring loudly. No big deal as the cat typically lays on her chest when he gets the opportunity. But here's where it gets uncomfortable for me. As the cat is laying on her chest I hear a loud buzzing and feel vibrations. At first I think one of us is getting a call then I realize she's turned on her vibrator and is going to town with me laying next to her not touching and this cat square in her chest doing this heavy purring.\n\nIn that moment I ask her if her sexuality extends to animals and she LOSES it. At this point I ask her if she remembers seeing pictures of my son and I when he was but a few weeks old sleeping on my chest, she says yes, so I then ask if she'd think it odd if I began masturbating myself at that moment. She thought it would be EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE. I agreed.

Asking if she is into beastiality because her cat was laying on her chest while she masturbated is a bit much. Cats have absolutely no boundaries, and some cats really like sitting on chests when you are lying down. You move them off, they get back on. It\u2019s a normal behavior. Would you think it was weird for her to masturbate while her cat sat at her feet or would you think it\u2019s a foot fetish bestiality thing? I think it\u2019s more likely it\u2019s not even something she considered or thought about, but I can see how people who haven\u2019t had pets their whole lives or have only had cats who aren\u2019t super needy would think it\u2019s weird. You could have said \u201cdo you think it\u2019s weird to masturbate with your cat on you?\u201d and gotten a better answer than asking if she is sexually attracted to her cat and comparing it to an infant. \n\nThat being said, she punched a wall.

I've had a cat get into my bedroom while I'm in the middle of things and try to climb onto my chest and it was an immediate end to everything. There's still nothing that inherently suggests being into bestiality. She does obviously display a different idea on what is or isn't weird, or at least she anthropomorphizes animals less than you or I do. It's a bit of a dick move to automatically just to that conclusion, but I'm not sure if that makes you an A though. I'm leaning towards NAH.", "YTA. She was comfortable.

It\u2019s easier than pushing her off and listening to her try and fail to jump her potato body back on the bed the whole time. \n\nIt\u2019s odd to make the jump from cat laying where the cat usually lays and beastiality and I can see why she\u2019s pissed. There\u2019s a long jump from cat laying on chest to using cat as a sex object. \n\nThat said, she shouldn\u2019t break holes in walls so they both suck.", ">People who punch walls do so to avoid punching other people\n\nSome people who punch walls do it to dramatically make sure you think about the fact they could be punching you instead.\n\nNot that deliberately trying to be intimidating is a better motive than trying to hold yourself back.", "Lol, her comment was so rude.
