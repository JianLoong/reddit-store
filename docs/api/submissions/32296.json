{"id": 32296, "submission_id": "18a7ner", "title": "AITA for paying 21K to send my kid to private school behind my ex-wife's back?", "selftext": "Our son is 8 and has an incredible curiosity about the world. His first and second grade teachers gave nothing but glowing praise in regards to both his intellectual growth and his demeanor. However, his third grade year has not gone well. His teacher has sent us several emails stating that our son does not pay attention in class and is cold toward his classmates. When his mother and I asked him how school is going, he tells us he hates it. He said \"all the teacher does is yell at the class to stop talking, then the kids keep talking and we never do anything and I hate being there.\" I can see the light fading from his eyes every day and every Sunday night mid-September on he cries because he doesn't want to go to school. \n\nMy son lives with his mother and spends weekends with me. We all live in the same town and I would describe the relationship between his mother and I as cooperative, but bad feelings persist. I asked my son a few weeks ago if he wanted to change schools and he responded \"God, yes.\" I asked his mother if she would have any issue with me sending him to a highly-regarded private school about 17 miles from our town. She reacted in a way that was not expected. She said I was being ridiculous and that it would be an undue burden on her to take him to a different school (fair) and it would be unfair to her other children if only one of her kids got to go to private school. I added that I would take him and drop him off everyday and pay for it 100% and she still said no. I told her I don't want our son to waste his potential, nor do I want to fail him as a father. In essence, she responded that our son is just being a brat because he's bored. \n\nI registered him at this school and paid the tuition. He starts in August. I told him what I had done and he was elated. Naturally, upon hearing this news his mother was apoplectic. All I said was \"fine, you tell him he isn't going because you think he's a brat.\" \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701649268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18a7ner/aita_for_paying_21k_to_send_my_kid_to_private/", "score": 4032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you legally permitted to make this decision and enact it without her consent?", "NTA maybe switch your custody schedule so you have him during the week for school and he goes to her on the weekend?", "INFO: are you going to drive him to school every day and if so, are you going to adjust the amount of time he spends with you?", "He starts in August?

Doesn\u2019t your parenting agreement say you both have to agree on education? I can understand her feeling like the burden is on her. There could be afterschool activities plus your kid spends more time on the road (leaves earlier and gets home later) which they hate. Then there\u2019s school emergencies/picking up a sick kid, and distance from her work. And how it affects her driving to other kid\u2019s\u2019 school(s).\n\n\nYou should have done this by the book instead of doing something that\u2019s violating a legal agreement/court ordered parenting agreement. Other than that I can relate but in my case (custodial parent) after calmly offering same as you (tuition plus transport) and making my case and was unable to get a yes, I told the them I respect their position (I didn\u2019t really) but I don\u2019t see a middleground so we can go to court and I will accept any decision a judge makes. They mulled it over and decided it\u2019s not worth going to court over, but as custodial parent it wasn\u2019t necessarily disruptive for me and my child or them. Just driving to a different (better) school and virtually no effect on the possession times. You now invade her space twice a day and if you have a standard agreement you aren\u2019t entitled to this kind of access to your child. You have forced her hand and you are gonna need her cooperation and support, you can\u2019t handle it alone. \n\n\nHopefully she doesn\u2019t get advice from a friend to take to court and will give it a shot and not resent you. You\u2019re not married anymore and can\u2019t bulldoze her into submission. There\u2019s a third party in your parenting relationship and they don\u2019t take kindly to violating a decree/parenting agreement. No-one cares that this is a good thing/it is a good thing to find a place where your child will get attention and education he needs if you violate a court ordered agreement. You messed up.", "Man I'm conflicted here because I'm very glad you're investing in your kid's education. But parenting needs to be done with the understanding and approval of both parents.", "Maybe you should switch custody times. You have him during the week and she takes him on the weekend.", "YTA\nFor going behind her back. You say it won't affect her because you will pay and give rides. But who subs for you when you can't drive? And her ability to be involved in your son's school activities, teacher conferences, etc. is now much more difficult. Not to mention housing kids with two different school schedules. Having a kid who wants to socialize with friends who live at a distance also affects her. You've made her life more difficult and possibly increased friction between her and your son if she can't meet these increased expectations.\n\nI'm not saying changing schools might not be the best decision. But working it out with your co-parent is the way to do things. Think how would you feel if she unilaterally says, nope, he's going to our local scool, hope you can get a refund.", "From my experience applying for \u2018highly regarded\u2019 US private schools, both parents must be interviewed and be on the application unless the other parent doesn\u2019t have legal custody. I don\u2019t know how you did this unless you filled out your son\u2019s address as yours, a lie, and omitted her from the application. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have him during the week how did you take him for the assessment, and the group interview during the week? How did you take him out of school for this without your wife\u2019s knowledge? How did your son keep this quiet from her during the application process? How is it that you already got admitted and deposited in December when most processes don\u2019t notify until the spring? \n\nIt\u2019s honestly very unbelievable how you got to the point of actually enrolling without your wife\u2019s knowledge. If this isn\u2019t fake YTA because you lied and demonstrated to your son it\u2019s ok to lie. You should have gone back to court and done it above board.", "YTA. Even if you have your kid's interests at heart this is absolutely not the right way to do this.\n\nThe reality is that you don't have the legal right to do what you have done and more particularly you don't have a custody arrangement that will allow you to enact it. You can't just make decisions like this without the consent of the other parent. You ex has custody during the week so she can just keep taking him to his old school.\n\nThe fact that you've used this approach will reflect badly on you when it inevitably comes up in court and harm the chances of getting what you want.\n\nAnd just to be clear. Regardless of what you or your son think of his current school, it isn't going to be bad to the degree that a court will remove him from it against the wishes of his primary carer. Like a court will stop you feeding your kid poison, but they won't take a side between if your kid prefers coke or lemonade.", "Third grade teacher here.  My answer is ESH.\n\nI\u2019ve been teaching this grade for several years now, and what\u2019s happening with your son now is actually more common than you think.  This is the age where a lot of children go through a big growth spurt in emotional maturity, and they become more aware of their sense of self and how they see themselves in the world.  This causes a lot of kids to start testing their parents in the whole \u201cdo I really have to do this?\u201d area.  Also, third grade is the age where kids start taking SBAC (or other state testing), so there\u2019s more pressure placed on them academically.  School\nis no longer as easy and fun as it used to be.  This is just some insight on why you start to see kids disliking school at that age.\n\nWithout knowing your son, it is hard for me to say if switching to a private school really is the best thing for him.  He could just be having a bad year in that particular class.  However, as others have stated, there could be something else bothering him that you are ignoring.  You and your ex need to communicate better (both with your son and each other) if you want to get to a solution that everyone will be happy with.", "NTA, you do whats best for your son her other kids aren't your priority", "ESH the first and second grade teachers were great, the third grade teacher is bad, and there\u2019s no option for getting the class changed, talking to the teacher, talking to the principal? Not to mention that starting in August doesn\u2019t address the issue this year at all, who knows what the 4th grade teacher would be like.\n\nYour ex doesn\u2019t sound great, but you went nuclear here.", "I\u2019m a bit shocked at all of the N T A votes here. You are N T A for wanting to send your child to a private school, but YTA for trying to force your ex\u2019s hand in this situation and for trying to paint the picture that she must not care about your son\u2019s well-being if she doesn\u2019t agree with your perspective. That\u2019s really crappy co-parenting. You\u2019re operating in bad faith as a co-parent and exhibiting super manipulative and controlling behavior. Your wife has your son more than you\u2026why do you think that you get to pull rank when you disagree? You were perfectly fine with your son going to this school to begin with even though you could have afforded private school. Therefore, you\u2019re being disingenuous to suggest that your ex-wife just doesn\u2019t want him to have the best opportunities. Did you even try to work with your wife and the school to see about other alternatives to solve his boredom? Maybe he needs to skip a grade? Or change teachers? It\u2019s not common for parents to pull kids out of school just because they have a bad few months with a new teacher. What happens if he doesn\u2019t like the new school?", "You explicitly stated that you\u2019re a weekend dad. You have no right to try and insert yourself here, at the mother\u2019s expense. Have some self respect.", "YTA for how you went about this. You said your custody agreement is that these decisions must be made jointly, you made a unilateral decision and then went and hyped your kid up about it to force your ex's hand. There are a lot of possible consequences here that no one will like. Not to mention that, given the issue is with a teacher specifically and not actually with his school, you had many other options before going nuclear like you did.", "ESH. Both OP and his ex-wife for not communicating further and trying to reach an agreement before OP went nuclear. OP sucks for going behind his ex\u2019s back and making a decision that did not need to be made for a couple more months at minimum. OP also doesn\u2019t talk about whatever interventions they have taken as parents to either add enrichment for the son (does the school have an honors program or other things the son could do for enrichment), to speak with the teacher/principal, or to teach the kid coping skills for how to manage boredom or dislike of a situation. Also, has he been to the doctor to test for adhd, inattentive type. He may be struggling because of boredom because it\u2019s actually ADHD (which it seems could be inherited if dad is impulsive and doesn\u2019t think through decisions like enrolling him in a school and paying tuition without having the other parent on board and trying out other inventions). I\u2019m a psychologist, and one pattern of maladaptive thinking that often leads to depression or discontent in life is called magical thinking. It\u2019s the belief that things will be better when or if something changes (ie, things will be better when I change schools). Unfortunately, all this does is set the kid up to stop trying to find satisfaction, enjoyment or engagement in his current situation (because I don\u2019t have to, I\u2019ll be out of here soon), and it can lead to him quitting things easily in the future when things get difficult or he doesn\u2019t like the situation. As others have pointed out, this is the first terrible year and the others have been great. Maybe next year will be better at the same school and maybe, with intervention, the rest of this year could be better. OP is more the AH in this situation than his ex, for sure. I get that it sucks to see your kid unhappy, and as a parent I know you want to move heaven and earth to make them feel better and be happy. However, there are a lot of unintended consequences for OP\u2019s impulsive decision before trying other interventions.", "YTA for using your kid as a pawn against his mom because she didn't agree about private school. That's not okay. \n\nHave either of you talked to the teacher about what your son told you? School counselor? Principal? Possibly changing classrooms? Anything?", "I think you did everything great right up until you registered him behind his mom\u2019s back.  If you need to go to court to get her to accept the deal, fine.  But doing it behind her back is nuts.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if she goes to court with the info that you did this behind her back, you might lose the weekend visitation.", "YTA you\u2019re acting like a brat and using your kid like a weapon. You should have gone to mediation to discuss all the options before making a unilateral decisions that it doesn\u2019t sound like you have the authority to make.", "YTA, you could have won in a custody modification hearing, easily. You shot yourself in the foot and made yourself look combative with a possible claim for alienation on her part because you got the kids' hopes up knowing he would he mad at his mother if she says no. Well done sir, you turned a slam dunk into a crapshoot.", "YTA - legally if you both have joint decision making power you violated the court order and a judge can hold you in contempt. You needed her agreement to change schools. How do you plan on getting him to school. You can't force her to take him as she has the option of just keeping him in the same school.\n\nI understand you wanting the best for your child. But you went about it wrong. First you brought your child into the middle of an adult decision. Now mom is the bad guy or you will be perceived as not living up to your promise if mom fights you on this and wins. \n\nIf you aren't enrolling him until August you could have petitioned the court for approval. That is the course of action to take when parents can't agree. If took this action I would say you are NTA but instead you said my decisions are more important then mom. \n\nGood luck trying to get custody switched and a judge agreeing with you on how you unilaterally made a parenting decision without mom's consent.", "Esh,   You need to handle this with his mother or go back to court,  you put your child in the middle and that\u2019s never ok", "INFO - do you have any sort of written custody agreement which would shed some light on how decisions about education are made?", "Mild yta.\n\nYou're doing the best for your child and your ex has a crappy reason (forcing the lowest common denominator to all her kids). But going behind her back and registering your child is NOT the way to do it. \n\nIt models behavior to your child (deception) that isn't desirable. Plus, as difficult as it is to come to an agreement, circumventing the process to come to a joint decision (like getting the courts involved) means that you've completely trashed the co-parenting relationship.\n\nSo I get why, but you're still a bit of an ah for doing it..she's a bit of an ah for not agreeing (although the logistical.chellenges of having one child in one school and her other children in another school.is real , even if you do 100 percent of the pickup dropoffs.  Different schedules, activities, vacations,.plus she will want to/have to manage school events and if you are sick your kid still has to get to school. )\n\nYou dont mention it but there are probably enrichment opportunities (gifted? Switching teachers? ) In the school itself that might not be exhausted. And honestly, social interaction is important - AS important as intellectual stimulation - and helping your kid figure out  ways to be nicer to their school matea is also helping him. Kids can become brats when they are bored (mine went through that stage). Not saying private school isn't the right solution ultimately, but you don't mention what you've done to help the current situation except to give him an out.", "Info: you offered to get the kid *to school* but how is he getting home?\n\nWill he need a uniform and are you going to be the one responsible for it? (Buying it, washing it if you don't buy enough pieces to make through to her regular wash schedule, noticing when its worn out, torn or outgrown and buying replacements, etc)\n\nWill there be extracurriculars that require driving to/from and will you be handling that?\n\nIs parent participation expected, and if so will you be fulfilling those hours?\n\nWill he need special equipment (computer, etc) or books and if so will you be purchasing it?", "YTA.\n\nDid you even try to address it with the school before you decided that you know best?", "YTA for sure. You are doing the right things but unfortunately this has to be done with mutual agreement.", "YTA. You should have continued discussing it with mom, and you know it. Instead of trying to support your son in his current environment, encouraging him to grow and adapt and be flexible - all learning experiences - you made the unilateral decision to take him to a school that in your mind is more expensive and therefore better. Meanwhile his last two teachers were great and so it seems like the public school is fine. You're teaching your son that when he encounters a problem or an uncomfortable situation or just one he doesn't like, you'll bail him out instead of helping him persevere. You didn't have the right to do this, and it was a bad call.", "YTA for making this decision unilaterally. My own son had the exact same thing happen in 4th grade. Brilliant kid, reading at an 8th grade level, says school is boring. Finally, when I shared my concerns with another teacher, she told me \"only boring people are bored.\" I told my son that \"only boring people are bored.\" He actually looked at me sheepishly. Then he started to solve his own problem.", "Soft YTA. I get your motive is for your son's best wishes, but you discussed it with her and then went against her anyway. There are legal processes you could have (and should have) followed to make it official. Now you've punted your kid in the middle of an adult fight that he doesn't need to be in.  I speak from experience of that kid in the middle of two fighting parents, and you're going to lose in this overall, regardless of intent.  If you're so fiercely determined to do the right thing for your son, and so evidently unbothered by financial pressures, do it the right way.", "YTA, \n\nEducation is a joint decision, she gave you valid reasons for not wanting your kid in a different school and your child will be in a different class by the time this happens anyway, it seems like you did it just to spite her.\n\nI'm sure you think your kid is brilliant, in most cases, they are not, we just like to think our children are special. They're really not. \n\nYour kid is like most other 3rd graders, when school starts becoming an actual challenge, they underperform until they figure out how to study. All kids are naturally curious, and all schools force them to buckle down and study the required materials.", "YTA. What you did is likely contempt of court. In a joint custody situation you can\u2019t make these kinds of decisions unilaterally. You negotiate and compromise to find a solution. \n\nFurther, what you did does NOTHING to solve the problem. Which you stated as being his dislike of the 3rd grade teacher. \n\nMost importantly, by involving your son in the decision you are poisoning the relationship with his mother and undermining her authority. He will never learn to respect her decisions. \n\nIn summary YTA.", "as a dad, N T A. but as a co-parent, Y T A, these decisions can\u2019t be unilateral.", "ESH. You and your ex should have a cooperative arrangement, but you overrode her here without much discussion. She's also an AH because she keeps calling your son a brat and then tried to get you to call him a brat, too. Enrolling him in a new school is also not really a great first-step solution to your son's behavior. The teacher has reached out, but it seems like neither you or your ex have really addressed what the teacher is saying. You talked to your son, which is important, but at the end of the day he's a child with a skewed perspective. You need to sit down with the teacher and get to the root of the issue. Why is he not paying attention in class? Why is he cold toward his classmates? If he is bored, why is that? Is the material not advanced enough, or is he simply disinterested in school? Why is he cold toward his classmates? That is a separate issue from not paying attention. If you don't get to the root of these issues, then enrolling him in another school may not help at all. Maybe it is just the school, but you can't make that leap based on just what you've given in the OP.", "Time to get downvoted but YTA. You asked the mum, she said no. You did it anyway behind her back and then told your kid so now he gets to be disappointed af when she tells him thats not happening. Co-parenting a child is about mutual understanding between both parents. Hes already gone to this school, you cant change that. If the custody agreement says she has him all week and you just get weekends that doesn't give you the right to change his schools. My family has been going through this same issue with my brother and his baby mama, you dont get to be a weekend parent and think you control everything. And if you have money for private school tuition why don't you have custody or have him during the week? Jumping straight to changing schools and taking him to school and home seems to be like you're trying to manipulate the custody agreement to get more time. There were other things you couldve dont first. You should've first went to the principal with the concerns about the teacher and see if they do anything, if they didnt your second step should've been to request a different teacher. Changing his school when you were specifically told not to, and not even attempting the other options, is impulsive and manipulative. Its not going to look good in court if she decides to tell the judge you're over stepping your agreement without permission. If you live in a mother state this might even get your custody reduced to every other weekend and might get your decision making rights revoked. If you truly wanted to switch schools and saw no way he could stay in that one then you should've went to the lawyers and discussed it with evidence. You just added a huge burden on your ex and are trying to paint her to look like the bad guy here.", "YTA. Firstly, you could have at least spoken to the teachers and seen what can be done, or if the next year the teaching would improve. \n\nAre you worried your kid going to be a butthole everytime something isn't perfect? What happens if the kid doesn't like a tea her at the new school? \n\n\nAlso are you going to pick you kid up after school sports? Or detentions? Or any other after school activity? \n\nAre you able to do this every single school day until your kid finishes school? \n\nIf not, you just signed the mum up to driving to 2 schools chasing kids around.", "YTA. Like it or not, you can't just change his school without agreement from the parent he lives with most of the time. You registered him and paid the fees in an attempt to force her to agree with you, and your plan backfired. You told him he could go to that school despite his mother saying no. You created that part of the situation. As for what's going on in school, it may just be a conflict with this one specific teacher, which means that next year the conflict may no longer exist. Switching him to a different school immediately might make some sense, but he wouldn't even be able to start this new school until he was done with his current teacher, anyway. You screwed up.", "YTA, that kind of change should be agreed upon by both parents.", "YTA you said you both have to agree and you didn't agree with keeping him there. Well she didn't agree to the school you picked so you both should have discussed it like adults and came to compromise. Instead you decided what you want is more important. Then just to drive the last nail in the coffin you used your son and his emotional well being as a weapon towards your ex to force her to give in or have him hate her if she doesn't. That can be seen as parental alienation by the courts. If she's smart she will consult an attorney and set firmer boundaries because you obviously can't it won't co-parent.", "Yta for doing things this way. Also YTA since you seem to likely be attributing all your kids issues to the school, could easily be him being bullied or that he is depressed or that he simply isn't as brilliant as you think.  But your next move somehow is to change a major part of his life without agreement or further discussion with his mom who cares for him MOST of the week  You could have tried tutoring, therapy, or at the very least discuss it further with your ex and his old school. You will be chewed up by the courts for doing this without proper discussions. It's good you can and you are willing to spend $ on his education, that's not the problem.", "As someone who\u2019s worked in education for 20 years. Here\u2019s my concern, did you give school a copy of your divorce decree. In my experience, public and private schools have a copy of divorce decree, so that as a school system we are following the decree. For example giving the child to the right parent on their week. In my experience with private schools, they interview the parents? So that parents understand the school code of conduct and the expectations of the parent. Private schools in my experience want parents involved. \n\nI would say ESH, you should have gone the legal route. Either you get to make educational decision on your own or you went to court to switch your  custody. His mother is failing him when it comes to education. Growing up I went to private school and my brother went to public school. I\u2019m a firm believer that fair is a place you ride rides and pet animals, it\u2019s not life. I would say go to meditation and see if y\u2019all can work this out. Court might not go your way. You could get in trouble for going behind your ex back.", "INFO\n\nWhat does your decree say about making decisions jointly?", "YTA", "Same thing happened to my son in 4th grade. I asked to switch him to a different teacher, and they did. He quickly went back to loving learning. I don't think I was the only parent complaining, as the teacher retired at the end of the school year, even though he was in his 40s.", "So, you just up and changed schools behind your wife\u2019s back even though she has primary custody and you agree it puts an undue burden on her to have to physically take him to this new school. Yeah, YTA. \n\nYou never mentioned this undue burden again once you made your decision to go behind her back, you just pat yourself on the back for being such a \u201cgood dad\u201d\ud83d\ude44\n\nYeah, you paid the tuition, but as you said, the kid *lives with his mother* (your words!), and that offer to pick him up and drop him off everyday was literally meaningless. You won\u2019t be doing any of that, she will be. \n\nAlso, your wife didn\u2019t say he\u2019s just a \u201cbored brat\u201d , you\u2019re prob twisting the shite out of her words, or you just made this up to make yourself look better. No wonder \u201cbad feelings persist\u201d- she\u2019s literally trying to co-parent with a weekend dad who *pulled his child out of school behind the primary custodial parents back*. Yeah, buddy: you ARE the asshole", "\"Just being a brat because he's bored\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExactly, he's not being challenged because the teacher is dealing with the other students 95% of the time. This was me, this IS my kids.  I wound up in \"special ed\" because they thought I was slow.  I wound up in college prep by 8th grade.  FOr my kids we had to move to a better district for them so they could be challenged and the teacher wasn't constantly dealing with \"other kids\".  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow they're thriving, in sports, band/orchestra, one of them is on the Robotics team.   \n Both get straight A's, well one is straight A's, the other has discovered \"boys\".

His first and second grade teachers gave nothing but glowing praise in regards to both his intellectual growth and his demeanor. However, his third grade year has not gone well. His teacher has sent us several emails stating that our son does not pay attention in class and is cold toward his classmates. When his mother and I asked him how school is going, he tells us he hates it. He said \"all the teacher does is yell at the class to stop talking, then the kids keep talking and we never do anything and I hate being there.\" I can see the light fading from his eyes every day and every Sunday night mid-September on he cries because he doesn't want to go to school. \n\nMy son lives with his mother and spends weekends with me. We all live in the same town and I would describe the relationship between his mother and I as cooperative, but bad feelings persist. I asked my son a few weeks ago if he wanted to change schools and he responded \"God, yes.\" I asked his mother if she would have any issue with me sending him to a highly-regarded private school about 17 miles from our town. She reacted in a way that was not expected. She said I was being ridiculous and that it would be an undue burden on her to take him to a different school (fair) and it would be unfair to her other children if only one of her kids got to go to private school. I added that I would take him and drop him off everyday and pay for it 100% and she still said no. I told her I don't want our son to waste his potential, nor do I want to fail him as a father. In essence, she responded that our son is just being a brat because he's bored. \n\nI registered him at this school and paid the tuition. He starts in August. I told him what I had done and he was elated. Naturally, upon hearing this news his mother was apoplectic. All I said was \"fine, you tell him he isn't going because you think he's a brat.\" \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

More information might alter that judgement, hence the request.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a drama junkie (which I might also be), I feel like the way she handled that could change my vote. Everyone snaps in anger sometimes and says things they don't mean. Also you said your son lives with his mother, which means, what, 70%? of the time you don't witness how he behaves. So you just have to take someone's word for it, his, your ex's, etc. NOW, before you get upset, he could be misbehaving at his mom's home a lot because of his situation at school (a teacher who yells at the kids and is ignored by the kids is one of three options:\n\n**A:** an overstressed teacher with a mostly bad class, where your kid might get picked on by the other students for being a teacher's pet simply for behaving properly\n\n**B:** an overstressed teacher with a bad class where even your kid misbehaves to avoid being picked on by the other students\n\n**C:** an ineffective teacher (not to be confused with an overstressed teacher, as children have a self-will of their own and bad parent involvement in their lives might be contributing to bad behavior at school and influencing your son))\n\nIn all of these situations it's best to at least remove your son from the class if not the whole school, and it might or might not contribute to better behavior at MOM'S home too. As long as he doesn't hold it over his siblings' heads and/or rub it in their faces (which is probably what your ex-wife is worried he'll do). Just because your son behaves at your place does NOT also mean he behaves at his Mom's place. And if your relationship is cooperative with bad feelings at best, then it's likely she's not going to tell you \"oh your son is awful at my place\" because then you'll probably get all in a huff and say \"my kid would never do that, I know him\" and fight for custody, even if he really does only behave properly at your home. Especially if he likes your place because you can afford more things. I'm not saying your kid is a bad kid, just to be clear. I'm saying that people - humans - react differently in different places and with varying results especially when stress (like being split between two families which is absolutely stressful) enters, and if he materially lives more richly at your place he might subconsciously be worse at his Mom's because he might be subconsciously blaming her for not providing the same lifestyle for him at her place especially if you're frosty but cooperative with his Mom (you're not going to be able to hide that from him no matter how clever and/or a good actor you believe yourself and your ex to be). You don't have to be a mean kid to do that, you just have to be stressed and not recognize it while you're still developing. I think part of a good education is being able to understand yourself too. Then again I could be completely off the mark and maybe he's a saint at his mom's, but I suspect he misbehaves more at her place and that's where the brat remark came in. **In summary, without having more info (for example, like how your ex responded to your passive aggressive comment after you went behind her back), I can't really offer a judgement other than ESH.

The easiest way to fix a chaotic classroom like OP described is to send the catalyst from the room, but if the parents get fussy about that and decide to make life difficult for the teacher, the kid walks right back in knowing there's no real consequence, and the rest of the class sees the lack of consequence and becomes a free for all just like it is in a public school.

Private school is not necessary better for the child? and in what world does an 8 year old know what\u2019s best? The father\u2019s arbitrary and unilateral decision making is way worse for the kid and the fact that he has zero respect for the mom who does most of the childcare and is more likely to make rational decisions regarding the child\u2019s welfare is a serious indictment on his ability to make decisions. \n\nYTA without a doubt", "Did you talk to your lawyer first?", "This varies wildly by state and the private school. I live in a state with great public education, and there's a lot of lousy private schools with less oversight so they can hire unqualified, unlicensed teachers. Customized lesson plans for individual learners is typical here. \n\nAnd yes, sometimes kids go through periods where they just don't like school. You can't switch them to a different private school each time that happens, you have to actually parent.", "From the comments there is a parenting plan in place for this child and I'm sure that parenting plan has provisions on how to resolve situations where the parents do not agree with each other, be it mediation, arbitration, or court.  OP has not done any of these and since OP told the child of the enrollment without agreement from his ex is potentially in violation of that order (depending on the terms).  He's not an asshole for advocating for private school with his ex, he's an asshole for the method he's chosen to follow, which is to unilaterally enroll the child without the mother's consent and failing to follow the court order governing how to resolve differences.   OP obviously has the money to afford an attorney and to get to a solution/decision on the problem, but instead he chooses to be the AH and start making unilateral decisions.\n\nPlus the parenting plan (which is a court order) probably states the child will attend public school based on the mother's address (she's the primary custodial parent), so OP is doubly an AH and is taunting a court to find him in contempt of the order by enrolling him without getting a change to the parenting plan.\n\nLet alone how much time is required to travel the 17 miles and how much earlier would the child need to wake up to facilitate that?  Child is 8, going on 9, and proper sleep is important, let alone the impact it might have on Ex's house to have different bedtimes, etc.\n\nAn OP did not mention speaking with the teacher at all, and there's no mention of grades slipping.  I don't see a change of circumstance to justify a change to the parenting plan.\n\nAnd, he offers to pay now, however, depending on the state, once the child goes to private school and the standard is set, OP could go back to court after a year or two and have the mother compelled to pay her share pursuant to the division of costs in the child support order.  \"I can pay going forward\" is a worthless promise and an AH thing to say by OP.", "Bullpucky. \n\nThe ex has primary custody for a reason.

This mother has primary custody and it would fall on her to drive her kid 35 miles a day. Sure, OP offered to drive him, but what about when OP goes out of town? Travels for work? His car breaks down? He's sick? Also, I absolutely think this is fake because OP didn't bring his kid to tour the school or get interviewed, but the kid hasn't visited the new school. What if it's just as bad for him? 'Different' doesn't mean better, nor does 'expensive.'", "Also setting him up so he has the kid every day for school drop off/pick up during his ex's time could be seen as trying to circumvent the custody agreement.", "Private schools also take funding from public schools.

I've honestly never seen differentiated teaching of gifted kids in mainstream gen ed classes that wasn't just \"write an extra paragraph\" or \"do 5 more problems\".  It's almost always independent work and there's never actually any teaching.
