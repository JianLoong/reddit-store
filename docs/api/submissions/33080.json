I was fine with it at the start because she would originally ask me to leave for about an hour. after a while, an hour became 2 hours, then 3, then 4. once she kicked me out for 4 and a half hours on a Sunday night at 11pm when she told me it was \"only going to be a few minutes\".\n* a was upset at her because I had a big exam the next day I needed to sleep for and I thought I was being nice enough that I let her use the room for 45 minutes. she gave me this weird condescending look and attitude after I exclaimed my displeasure with her behavior. I brushed it off and went into my room. this is where it gets kinda weird...\n* I walk into my room and I notice that 1 of the 3 pillows I had on my bed was missing. its a custom pillow my mom gave me before I left for school. I don't really use it as a pillow but more as a decoration or a reminder of my mom and home. I thought it fell in between my bed and the wall so I decided to pick it up in the morning because I was so tired.\n* she started telling me that she hooked up with this guy a few times in the 4.5 hours. she went into detail about what they did. I didn't really care seeing as we're both very open with each other and share this kind of stuff. right as I was going to bed I asked her if she could see the pillow on the floor from her bed since I though it fell down the crack. as soon as I said that, I noticed it on her bed, kind of tucked away under her blanket. I called her out and asked why it was on her bed. she told me that she was using it while the guy was over since she \"didn't have enough\" on her bed prevent her from falling off the bed. I was immediately grossed out that she had sex on top of my pillow and angrily asked for it back. she didn't have sex directly on it, but it was on her bed next to her during the deed.

So y\u2019all are okay with bringing random men to your place? So she doesn\u2019t know them well, but they know where y\u2019all live, who lives in the home, and the items you have in there? This is very dangerous and should stop. Please set up cameras outside your door if you don\u2019t have that already.\n\nTo answer your question, no. This is disgusting. She will now need to find a different place to hook up with these men. She can go back to their place or find a hourly motel.
