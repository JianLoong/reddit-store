You aren't asking anyone else to give up anything, and you'll be returning for all the actual celebrations.", "NTA.  \n\nThis isn't about you staying the night- as you say, you're happy to go and stay for the duration as long as someone looks after the dog.  \n\nThis is about whether or not it's okay to leave a dog crated for 20+ hours.  \n\nI don't believe it is.  That's bad for the dog, and the dog will almost certainly have to pee at some point.  So she'll be torturing herself trying to hold it, until she can't, and at that point she'll have to go in the crate because a dog physically cannot hold it for 20+ hours.  And she'll feel awful about it because she knows she's not supposed to do that.  But it will make it that much easier for her to do it again next time you have to leave her.  \n\nNo, that's what BAD dog owners do.  \n\nAs a good training tip with your dog- I suggest for situations like this, take a newspaper and roll it up, and then lightly smack your boyfriend in the nose while sternly saying NO! BAD boyfriend!  Then give your dog a treat because she sounds like a good dog.  \n\nAs I see it you have a few choices-- \n\n1. Stay home at night.  Take the dog out early Christmas AM, then depart very early AM so you can arrive around when the festivities begin.  \n\n2. Take the dog out at night, then crate her and leave.  Stay at the host's house overnight.  Do some early AM Christmas stuff and open presents or whatever, then head home to let the dog out, feed, take her around the block, etc.  Then with the dog clock reset, head back and do holiday dinner.  \n\n3.

You\u2019re being the responsible one, NOT trying to force your dog to be included, and you\u2019re being punished for it!

Its not just about bringing provisions for the dog, it's about the environment its going to.

Very unreasonable to think it would be ok to leave the dog in a crate for that long and especially, over-night.
