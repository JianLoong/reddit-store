It's actually pretty concerning that your boyfriend thinks you should kennel your dog for that long just for the sake of a tradition - especially since you'd spend the night and then leave to care for the dog and then come back anyway. What's the point of the sleepover if you go home in the morning and come back anyway?", "NTA. It\u2019s cruel to leave a dog in a kennel for that long. Your bf sucks for trying to downplay your very valid concern. You came up with a reasonable compromise and he\u2019s still pushing. Tbh I probably wouldn\u2019t even stay the night as like you, my dogs are my family and I would prioritize them especially as your dog literally relies on you alone for care.", "NTA. I wouldn't do that to my own pet either.", "NTA: You have responsibilities if they don't allow the animal to come with this is a very reasonable compromise.", "No! It's not acceptable no leave a dog crated that long. Just because his family has a tradition doesn't mean you should neglect/abuse your dog. Reevaluate whether this guy is right for you if he so callously expc6s your dog to suffer like that.", "YWNBTA. Your dog needs care and its unfair to leave her alone for that long.", "NTA.  Having a dog means that you can't do things like leave home for 24 hours", "I haven't had to crate my dogs for that long ever and wouldn't have any idea how they would react to that a single time as they've never been conditioned for that.  I've also had the luxury of a big enough garage that I was able to put a 5ft x 10ft kennel in there for the 2 of them to share if I'm gone for 16 hours or more.  If you had something like that with a couple pads she'd be fine.  If you're talking plastic crate with nowhere to go, that's probably a hard no.  \nIf you and the BF can't come up with better accomodations for her, then you're NTA there.

Ask you BF if he would want to be locked in the bathroom for 24 hours straight and see how he reacts. Also, just because his family has typically spent the night at the hosts\u2019 house does not mean that you are obligated to do so - traditions are supposed to be fun, not iron-bound shackles that you *must* conform to come hell or high water, nor are you obligated to agree to a tradition just because you are dating someone. You are his girlfriend, not his possession.", "NTA. You\u2019re being a responsible vet owner. That is basically abusive to leave your dog in a kennel that long! I have large dogs my self and they come first over my plans. But mine haven\u2019t needed to be crated since they were puppies. I can leave them over night if need be lose around the house.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe your boyfriend actually feels that is a viable option. That is straight up neglect. How could you enjoy your Christmas knowing your dog is either holding their bladder for over 12 hours or forced to lay in their own urine while you are at some cozy Christmas sleep over?

It's the responsible thing to do.", "NTA you're being a responsible pet owner.\n\nSounds like you live close enough for you to still get there at a reasonable time if leaving in the morning so they'll still see you. \n\nBF should be fine for one night without you.

You\u2019ve provided a solution where you are both spending all the awake time with him and his fam and seeing to your dog, and he\u2019s shooting it down, so does he want you to come or does he want to be mad? I\u2019d stop discussing it and just do it when the time comes.", "NTA! I would either bring my dog with me or go over in the morning when festivities begin!", "NTA you are being a responsible pet owner.  You aren't asking anyone else to give up anything, and you'll be returning for all the actual celebrations.", "NTA.  \n\nThis isn't about you staying the night- as you say, you're happy to go and stay for the duration as long as someone looks after the dog.  \n\nThis is about whether or not it's okay to leave a dog crated for 20+ hours.  \n\nI don't believe it is.  That's bad for the dog, and the dog will almost certainly have to pee at some point.  So she'll be torturing herself trying to hold it, until she can't, and at that point she'll have to go in the crate because a dog physically cannot hold it for 20+ hours.  And she'll feel awful about it because she knows she's not supposed to do that.  But it will make it that much easier for her to do it again next time you have to leave her.  \n\nNo, that's what BAD dog owners do.  \n\nAs a good training tip with your dog- I suggest for situations like this, take a newspaper and roll it up, and then lightly smack your boyfriend in the nose while sternly saying NO! BAD boyfriend!  Then give your dog a treat because she sounds like a good dog.  \n\nAs I see it you have a few choices-- \n\n1. Stay home at night.  Take the dog out early Christmas AM, then depart very early AM so you can arrive around when the festivities begin.  \n\n2. Take the dog out at night, then crate her and leave.  Stay at the host's house overnight.  Do some early AM Christmas stuff and open presents or whatever, then head home to let the dog out, feed, take her around the block, etc.  Then with the dog clock reset, head back and do holiday dinner.  \n\n3. Find a dog sitter who will come and walk/feed the dog while you are away.", "NTA very clearly! I love that this is sort of the inverse of all those posts where the OP is trying to hold their ground against entitled family who insist on bringing dogs to events that aren\u2019t pet friendly. You\u2019re being the responsible one, NOT trying to force your dog to be included, and you\u2019re being punished for it! Hold your ground, and also perhaps pay the dog tax for all us pet-loving redditors \ud83d\ude01", "Eh.  NAH\n\nI mean, the whole \"leaving dogs in a professionally-run dog kennel is animal abuse\" thing is a load of crap.

That\u2019s no holiday for the dog.", "I think it would be pretty rude expecting to bring a large dog to someone else's house overnight who wouldn't have the provisions for it.\n\nNot to mention the dog may get stressed around that many people for so long.", "Timeout, your pet what again? Did you just slip a pet skunk in there? I have so many questions...\n\nSounds like you love your pet, good for you!", "Not the bathroom, in a closet with no place to go other than where you\u2019re sitting.

Food dishes, toys, bed, food, treats and whatever else the dog needs.", "If you remove their scent glands they are really sweet and cuddly. \n\nHave you ever pet one? They are sooooooo soft. \n\nNo, I don't have one, but I've been to a farm where they have a few.", "I wasn't putting it down, just doing a double take. I have heard of people keeping them as pets before, I figured they're nice and cute and most don't chase a poor paint covered black cat around all day. \n\nQuestions are more like, the scent gland thing obviously, and claws, temperament, acquisition, care and feeding (are they more like a dog or a cat?), etc.", "NTA- you're correct, dogs should not stay kenneled that long! This is a living creature we're talking about here! Is it not possible for your dog to come with you guys?\n\nOne time, I had to stay the night at a guy's house that I was dating because the weather was too bad, and my dog was at home, uncrated.

I left at 6am to get back home, so she was by herself for about 12 hours, and THAT was too long.", "Nta. Trying to find a kennel or a pet sitter.", "I know I wouldn't do that to my dog.  Its cruel.

Obviously she would have to speak to the homeowners and the other guests before hand and obviously there has to be space for the dog. \n\nAlso if the dog is known to be uncomfortable in strange places or around strange people there wouldn't even be a need to ask if you can bring the dog because you wouldn't even want to bring the dog under those circumstances.", "Yeah I do, you asked why the dog can't go with them.\n\nAssume that between the BF wanting to leave the dog in a Kennel for 20 hours and the OP preferring to stay home when everyone else will be there that for whatever reason it's not an option.\n\nIn most cases it wouldn't be an option.", "I never asked why the dog can't go with them. \n\nIt took me three or four read throughs to understand what  the hell you were trying to say. You are assuming that she already asked to bring the dog and they already said no. Even though she never said that this actually happened. You may be right on that account, however, I see no reason why she would have left that information out if it were so.", "You didn't, the person I originally responded to did. On phone so it didn't go up that far, so I assumed you were the same person. Apologies for that misunderstanding.\n\nPoint still stands though. Its not just about bringing provisions for the dog, it's about the environment its going to. I'm assuming it's not an option for whatever reason since the BF is inclined to leave the dog in a kennel unattended for that long.\n\nAs to why it was left out, who knows but it's not particularly needed to come to a logical conclusion."]}
