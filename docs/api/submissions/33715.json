This man, let's call him Lee, has always been convinced that he is gay. He came out to his parents and friends when he was a freshman in college and has been openly gay ever since, despite the fact that gays are persecuted in our country. \n\nOur relationship with him was not ideal, we broke up, honestly my fault. We have stayed in touch with Lee, but only as friends. \n\nRecently, Lee surprised us all with the news that he was dating a girl. We were all so used to Lee calling himself openly gay and denying that he could be bisexual that we were a bit shocked. Lee is an attractive enough guy, he's been offered many relationships by other girls over the years, but he's turned them down every time. \n\nSomeone even gently asked him if Lee had decided to hide his homosexuality because of the worsening situation with the persecution of gays in our country. But Lee said that he really fell in love with her. \n\nHe also recently announced that he had proposed to this girl and that they were going to have children. \n\nWhen I found out that Lee was dating a girl, I had a joke that I really wanted to say. And now I finally got the chance. I was passing through Lee's town and stopped by to have a cup of tea with him and his fianc\u00e9e. As we sat in the kitchen, I said to his girlfriend, \"Oh, I was such a lousy boyfriend that Lee is disappointed in all men and has decided to become heterosexual and choosed you?\" I was just joking, but Lee's fianc\u00e9e looked upset and almost cried. It certainly wasn't because of Lee's accidental outing; his fianc\u00e9e knew he'd had relationships with men before her. \n\nThe goodbye was awkward, and a short time later Lee texted me that his fianc\u00e9e was very upset about my joke and that I had made an offensive joke.", "created_utc": 1703568480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0sj3/aitah_for_making_a_joke_about_my_exs_fianc\u00e9e/", "score": 53, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Lee's journey of self-discovery most likely had very little to do with whether or not you were a bad boyfriend, and joking about turning him straight could be really hurtful if he's discovered he's bisexual. \n\nPlus, if the persecution of gay people in your country truly is getting worse, why would you out him to his fiance? What if she was a raging homophobe herself, or has a super religious family? You could have really endangered him, all for a joke that wasn't at all funny.", "YTA, you valued your opportunity to make an insensitive joke because you really wanted to say it.\n\nWho cares if Lee is dating a guy or girl? If you all are only friends, you should be supporting his decision and be happy for him, not making jokes that can create some unwanted tension.", "YTA.\n\nHe did not become heterosexual, he just went back to the default setting. \nJealous much?", "Definitely YTA! You were being extremely vindictive and passive-aggressive when you told that joke. Who would think it was even remotely funny? Definitely not him, and obviously not her. You should really apologize.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

There was no need to say it unless you were trying to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you were capable of acting like a heartless asshole. YTA", "I'm kind of leaning towards YTA.\n\nYou seem like you don't respect Lee's choice in partner, so you made a crude joke with his fianc\u00e9e (who you just met!) as the butt. Jokes like that are for when you know a couple better.", "Nope. If they don't wanna hear it or you don't want to hear their response or have to make jokes about the clown be single.", "YTA, it was a selfish reaction and certainly not a joke ; mind your own business.", "YTA. And petty. Not a good look.", "YTA, it was not appropriate to make that joke out loud. A joke like that, unless asked to voice it should have been kept in your brain.", "YTA.\n\nYou joke was forced and insulting to the fiancee.\n\nTo me it sounds like you are not over your ex or you just hate the fact that he might be infact a bi-sexual not gay.\n\nYou should apologize to both of them honestly or just leave them alone. They seems to be happy in their relationship.", "You just could not see him happy and could not process that he has found happiness with someone other than you, could you?

You two aren\u2019t in a place where you can joke about this, obviously", "YTA. You're pointing out that she is somehow the outlier and disguised it as joke about how \"lousy\" of a partner you were. Your joke reduces her to being the \"next best thing\"; imo, you should offer an apology.", "I'm going to go with a gentle YTA on this one.  \n\nThere are certain in-jokes that you can make with your friends that should never be voiced around other people who are not in on the joke.   This is one of those times to me.\n\nI get that to you it was a funny joke.  And among your friend group it probably would have gone over better.  But this sounds like it was one of (if not the) first times you met her face-to-face.  She didn't have the background to frame this joke.", "Seems tasteless to me, availing yourself of their hospitality only to make a \"joke\" that could easily have upset one or both of them.

A joke is only a joke if everyone thinks it's funny and laughs. It sounds like you are jealous and offended by his decision.", "You put her down. That's not funny. \n\nYou also made it sound like you were resentful.
