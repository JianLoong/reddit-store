Lee's journey of self-discovery most likely had very little to do with whether or not you were a bad boyfriend, and joking about turning him straight could be really hurtful if he's discovered he's bisexual. \n\nPlus, if the persecution of gay people in your country truly is getting worse, why would you out him to his fiance? What if she was a raging homophobe herself, or has a super religious family? You could have really endangered him, all for a joke that wasn't at all funny.\n\nEdit: it's been pointed out that OP has said the fiance knew about Lee's past, but it's not at all clear as to whether or not OP knew that when he made the joke. If he knew that ahead of time, that makes that point moot, but I still think YTA as the joke still comes off as unnecessary. At best its tone-deaf; at worst, it feels like OP still has feelings and is harboring some resentment against the fiance. Kind of a gross situation.", "YTA, you valued your opportunity to make an insensitive joke because you really wanted to say it.\n\nWho cares if Lee is dating a guy or girl?
