If I vacuum when they\u2019re watching tv, I let them turn the volume up a little. This only happens when it\u2019s out for long periods of time (cleaning day) as they abandon the tv eventually.\n\nSIL (32f) came by with her kids (5m/4f/3m) for a surprise visit on cleaning day. Our 5 year old had a birthday party the previous weekend so the house was a wreck and my husband was at work so it was just me and the kids upstairs. I keep the house locked up, so she let herself in with a spare key we gave out for emergencies. We were all in the play room when they busted in, it absolutely scared the shit out of me.\n\nI turned the vacuum off (5 year old turned the tv down) and I apologized for not seeing her calls/texts, because obviously in cleaning I\u2019d missed something and she totally didn\u2019t just let herself into my locked house, but SIL informed me she hadn\u2019t called or texted. They were in the neighborhood to drop off a present since they missed the party due to vacation. She saw my car here but nobody answered the door so she just let everyone in. \n\nBefore I could ask her why she thought she could just let herself into my locked house without notifying me (we aren\u2019t close with them like that), she went off on me for letting the girls \u201crun rampant with the tv while I\u2019m not paying attention to them\u201d, that it was dangerous for so much noise to be distracting me at once and she could have been some random person letting themselves inside to do \u201cgod only knows\u201d, cringey shudder included. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the most mature response, but I was so befuddled that I just started laughing hysterically. One moment I\u2019m mindlessly vacuuming up popcorn and the next I\u2019m being lectured on the care of my kids by an uninvited house guest. I asked if this random person would also use their emergency only spare key to get inside which caused her to turn red and develop a stutter. She malfunctioned further when I asked if she had remembered to lock the door again behind her. She told me that my daughter can forget about her present and she corralled her kids before hastily leaving. I had to lock the door again after her too, of course. \n\nI texted my husband to let him know what happened and he told me he would deal with it so I left it. When he came home later that evening, he had their spare key. Apparently he stopped by after work to chat and she started in on him too. His brother wasn\u2019t home at the time so instead of engaging he just asked for the key back, which she threw at him, and he left. \n\nSince then, we\u2019ve gotten calls from family asking why I laughed in the face of SIL\u2019s \u201cgenuine concern\u201d and if we\u2019re being safe with our kids. Most seem to understand when I explain the whole situation but some still took SIL\u2019s side or said I should have handled it differently.

Change locks/rekey locks because she might have made copies. Find someone else to be your emergency keyholder as SIL cannot be trusted anymore. And good on your husband for having your back on this. (I'd be wondering how many other times she's used that emergency key that you never found out about...)", "NTA\n\nShe just walked into your home with no notification using the emergency-only key.  When called out on it, she childishly said your kid won't get a present.  What if the kids were visiting friends and you were having alone time with your husband?  Awkward!", "NTA.  Oh boy.   I think you handled this perfectly, including the laugh. Especially because of the laugh.   You don't owe her any explanation.   What kind of person punishes a child in this situation and holds back her gift.   Wow.  \n\nYour husband gets a round of applause also.  \n\nYour SIL needs to get a life, get off her high horse (makes her ass look big) and definitely needs to grow up.", "I am glad you have your key back.\n\nYour SIL had no right to walk into your home.  She hadn't called or texted you ahead of time. You couldn't hear the doorbell because you had a vacuum on.\n\nShe startled you and made assumptions that the kids were running rampant, when they were not.\n\nNTA", "So SIL was all judge, judge, judge and in your business but couldn\u2019t handle the fallout. Even worse, she got back at you via your child. Tell family to pipe down, the SIL comment about the key is plainly ridiculous. Your hubby was fabulous for having your back tho\n\nNTA but SIL and family are huge ones", "NTA. The hysterical laughter sounds like an odd response but otherwise you were completely reasonable. It's pretty funny to me that SIL is now doing damage control by trying to rally family members about how 'she was only concerned'. It flies in the face of logic that you were dangerously distracted seeing that she let herself in, uninvited, by misusing an emergency key, which an intruder would obviously not have. What, we as parents aren't allowed to have a moment in which there are loud sounds in the house, or to be immersed in a task? It sounds like she needed a lesson, and got it, so stand your ground with the criticisms from family.", "NTA \n\nAnd the family members calling you are definitely getting a very edited version of the events from SIL\u2019s point of view. So hopefully they\u2019ll let it go if and when they get the full story.", "NTA lmao SIL way overstepped her boundaries and deserved to be laughed at and embarrassed. I hope you eventually tell her that all of Reddit is laughing at her rudeness too", "Info: did they tell you how you should have reacted to this insanity?", "At the end of the day this woman entered your home without permission and thats not ok.

I watch my son's family pets when they are out of town. That is the ONLY time I use my key to their house. I can't imagine feeling at home enough to just walk in whenever I want to. And then I'm there just enough to do my job (walk the dogs, feed all the animals, etc) and that's it. I don't hang out, I don't nose around.

Also, teaching them that their wants supersede anything else, and if anything is temporarily preventing them from doing what they want, they just just go harder.\n\nAlso, personal advice, never give out 'emergency keys.'  In the event of an actual emergency, emergency services will have zero issue gaining entry to your house without a key.", "NTA I doubt she was actually concerned simply covering up for letting herself in and not calling/texting before dropping by", "NTA.  She literally let herself into your home uninvited & then tried to tell you, you weren't doing a good job parenting.  WTF gives her the entitlement?  I love your reaction.

She needs to mind her own business. If your kids are clean, fed, and happy and not in danger she needs to worry about herself. She clearly has no boundaries and you and your husband had every right to handle it the way you did. If we are being honest, she is lucky all you did was laugh as majority of people would have started screaming at her the second she entered your home unannounced. Then they would have torn into her more for worrying about your kids when she should be worried about her own. And then to punish your CHILD for her behavior and you laughing is pathetic. Good for your husband for backing you up on this and taking the key back.", "NTA", "NTA Your SIL is a HUGE one though.
