Change locks/rekey locks because she might have made copies. Find someone else to be your emergency keyholder as SIL cannot be trusted anymore. And good on your husband for having your back on this. (I'd be wondering how many other times she's used that emergency key that you never found out about...)", "NTA\n\nShe just walked into your home with no notification using the emergency-only key.  When called out on it, she childishly said your kid won't get a present.  What if the kids were visiting friends and you were having alone time with your husband?  Awkward!", "NTA.  Oh boy.   I think you handled this perfectly, including the laugh. Especially because of the laugh.   You don't owe her any explanation.   What kind of person punishes a child in this situation and holds back her gift.   Wow.  \n\nYour husband gets a round of applause also.  \n\nYour SIL needs to get a life, get off her high horse (makes her ass look big) and definitely needs to grow up.", "I am glad you have your key back.\n\nYour SIL had not right to walk into your home.  She hadn't; called or texted you ahead of time. You couldn't;t hear the doorbell because you had a vacuum on.\n\nShe startled you and made assumption that the kids were running rampant, when they were not.  \n\nNTA", "So SIL was all judge, judge, judge and in your business but couldn\u2019t handle the fallout. Even worse, she got back at you via your child. Tell family to pipe down, the SIL comment about the key is plainly ridiculous. Your hubby was fabulous for having your back tho\n\nNTA but SIL and family are huge ones", "NTA. The hysterical laughter sounds like an odd response but otherwise you were completely reasonable. It's pretty funny to me that SIL is now doing damage control by trying to rally family members about how 'she was only concerned'. It flies in the face of logic that you were dangerously distracted seeing that she let herself in, uninvited, by misusing an emergency key, which an intruder would obviously not have. What, we as parents aren't allowed to have a moment in which there are loud sounds in the house, or to be immersed in a task? It sounds like she needed a lesson, and got it, so stand your ground with the criticisms from family.", "NTA \n\nAnd the family members calling you are definitely getting a very edited version of the events from SIL\u2019s point of view. So hopefully they\u2019ll let it go if and when they get the full story.", "NTA lmao SIL way overstepped her boundaries and deserved to be laughed at and embarrassed. I hope you eventually tell her that all of Reddit is laughing at her rudeness too", "Info: did they tell you how you should have reacted to this insanity?", "At the end of the day this woman entered your home without permission and thats not ok.

I watch my son's family pets when they are out of town. That is the ONLY time I use my key to their house. I can't imagine feeling at home enough to just walk in whenever I want to.
