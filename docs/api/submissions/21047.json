She is the one giving birth, therefore she is the one who decides who gets to be in the room with her. You have no right to be in that room unless she says you can be in that room. Get over yourself. I would say the same thing even if you were still a couple.", "YTA, and sucks for you, but you don\u2019t get a say here. This isn\u2019t an invite to a garden party that she decided to revoke, there is no fair or unfair, this is her major medical event.\n\nThis is going to be one of the scariest, vulnerable, difficult times in your ex\u2019s life. She gets to decide who she trusts to support her during her birth.", "YTA Of course she doesn\u2019t want her ex in there. What are you thinking? She\u2019ll be going to excruciating pain and needs support. The person in the room isn\u2019t there to watch the baby getting born, but to support and comfort your ex. You have absolutely no right to be there.", "YTA, you're young still bud, so I dont blame you for feeling the way you do, but trust me when I tell you. You really glazed over the \"labor isent easy part\" .... It can be fucking deadly for both her an yalls baby. Stress and uncomfort can raise those chances with every literal heartbeat. In my opinion, you should apologize and support her in whatever way SHE needs you. If that is waiting in the waiting room, so be it. At the end of the day, it's her body, and she sounds like she's trying to do what is best for herself because it is literally what's best for the baby that is still physically attached to her. So take a deep breath, swallow your pride, and try not to take it personally. You need to be there for your daughter. The best way to do that, in my opinion, is to respect the mother of your childs bodily autonomy. If your daughter has a kid, you wouldn't want the father of her child to do what you're doing.", "Yta. It\u2019s a very vulnerable time and she deserves to have her support there. Not only that if she\u2019s not comfortable it can cause labour to be more painful, or longer. It\u2019s not fair on her to distress her like that.\nIt is unfortunate for you. But I promise it will not affect your bond with your girl. My husband missed our child\u2019s birth parking the car (he didn\u2019t know I was in labour before the drive as it happened quickly at night) and that child adores him and is his biggest fan", "YTA. She's going trough an incredibly painful, dangerous medical procedure during which she'll be vulnerable and literally exposed. The only person having a choice about who's there during that is her. Very few people would want an ex there during this. Appreciate that you're allowed in immediately afterwards when she's still exhausted and vulnerable. Would you want to have her present while you push a butternut squash out your backside? Be honest to yourself and then think again if she's selfish", "YTA \n\nShe's currently going through pregnancy which a complete emotional roller-coaster, and is about to push a small watermelon sized child out. Hormones are already a struggle, it's now compounded by the end of the relationship, fear of giving birth etc.\n\nShe is absolutely thinking about her own feelings, and so she should. Giving birth isn't a spectator sport, if her bestie is going to give unwavering support, then her bestie should be in the room.\n\nShe hasn't told you to stay away from the hospital, just not in the room. Giving birth is one of the most vulnerable moments of a woman's life,  and if she becomes stressed that can have implications during the birth.\n\nYou need to get down of that high horse, and think about what's best for the health and safe delivery of your child.", "YTA This isn't about you. It's about the woman giving birth.", "[removed]", "YTA \n\nListen I am usually the first person that advocate for dad to be in the room. I have gotten in countless arguments with people on this app for that very reason. However this situation is different.\n\nFirst off you don\u2019t get to guilt and manipulate her. This is a huge red flag and that in itself tells\nMe you will not be supportive of her.\n\nSecond you just recently broke up. Usually there are hurt feeling and anger associated with a new break up. It\u2019s tension your ex and baby doesn\u2019t need.\n\nThird she doesn\u2019t feel safe with you. Not that I think you hurt her but save in the sense she doesn\u2019t want to be vulnerable with you.\n\nForth it ultimate her decision. You need to respect it. Don\u2019t go to name calling when you don\u2019t get your way.\n\nBe glad she is letting you visit. Truth is it\u2019s her medical procedure your not needed or entitled to be in the room. Get over yourself. The gf needs calm. She needs to be supportive. She needs to feel safe. You can not provide those things for her.\n\nStop complaining. Stop trying to be a bully. Let her deliver the baby in peace. Until the baby is born your not entitled to anything.", "YTA. Yes it sucks that you won't be there when your daugther is born. But your ex girlfriend will be in one of her weakest moments for hours. She will need someone who is there for her not just for the baby. She will need support an that much longer. So you are more selfish than her. You broke up and its seem she doesn't think you will supporting her - it also sounds like you just care about your daughter.\n\nBe there in the waitingroom if you want. Maybe ask her and the hospital, if she says it would be okay - if you can come in to cut the umbilical cord. But let her have a person with her she can trust during this time.", "YTA.\n\nThis woman is going to have to go through labor and delivery of a human baby. The only people in the room should be the medical staff and people to support her and get her through the delivery reassured and comfortable. If that\u2019s not you then that\u2019s not you.", "YTA. Labour is not a spectator sport, it is a medical procedure that both she and your daughter will be going through, and a very intimate one as well.  Your ex will need all the emotional support she can get and if that is her best friend then so be it.", "Tbh, if you\u2019re broken up there must be a reason. It could simply be it didn\u2019t work. If she doesn\u2019t want you in the room, I\u2019m sure there is a reason. You being so dismissive with your airquotes gives reason that you haven\u2019t been as supportive as possible and you\u2019re attitude and entitlement can get you kicked out of wing. You have no rights when it comes to her body. If you had a daughter, would u berate her in x years if she didn\u2019t allow the over glorified sperm donor in the room?

The mother decides who gets to be with her during birth, pretty simple.\nIf she doesn't feel supported by you and you just want to be there just to be there, then she has every right to not let you come. I'm sure you also didn't break up over nothing and she has a reason to not feel supported by you. You're a massive asshole.", "YTA. You are an ex. You don't get to see that part of her anymore.

Tell her that you will be right outside the door and will be ready to help in any way you can.\n\nPack a bag and leave it by your door.

You aren't an arsehole for wanting to be there for the birth of your child but putting your wants over the pregnant woman's needs and then calling her selfish definitely does make you 1.\n\nGiving birth is invasive, stressful, dangerous and frankly makes the woman very vulnerable mentally and physically. Your Ex isn't an incubator, she is someone going through a major medical procedure that just happens to birth your kid.\n\nMy advice is to prove to your ex that you won't be a stress trigger from now to the birth, tell her you will stay in waiting room and ask to at least hold baby before the friend, come to her with plans and compromises. If you push, you show you have no real concerns for her wellbeing and if you guys are toxic then it feeds into her wanting to piss you off. Be an adult and know that sometimes you have to step back and get our own way. You are entitled to feel upset and pissed but unfortunately for you your ex is more important in this situation.\n\nGood luck on fatherhood.", "YTA \u2026 you are no longer together and she won\u2019t feel comfortable with you in the room. \n\nShe needs someone who will help her feel comfortable and that is no longer get you.

My ex and I broke up two weeks ago. Before we broke up we had already planned on me being in the room when she gives birth, and she\u2019s now decided that she doesn\u2019t want me there. The hospital only allows one person, and even though we broke up I still assume it would be me. She told me today that she\u2019s decided that she wants her best friend  with her because she\u2019s \u201csupportive\u201d, and she pulled the \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be supportive enough while I\u2019m in labor\u201d card. I explained to her that I understand that labor and delivery isn\u2019t easy and she needs support, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to miss my daughter\u2019s birth just because we broke up. She goes onto tell me that Im welcome to stay in the waiting room, and come in as soon as my baby is born. I called her selfish because I feel like she\u2019s only thinking about her own feelings here, and she won\u2019t talk to me now. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You called her selfish because she was only thinking about herself and her feelings. This right here is why you shouldn\u2019t be in that room. When a woman is giving birth her comfort and feelings come first. You disregarding them now proves her right about the level of support she would receive from you.  This isn\u2019t about you and what you want.  Mom comes first, baby comes a close second. She\u2019s letting you see your daughter right away as of now. If you keep harassing her about your wants and that might change. She could decide to not let you in at all and the hospital would back her up.  Stop digging this hole before you\u2019re too deep to get out.", "You are the selfish one. Its a really delicate moment ans she needs support. She doesnt trust you anymore. So you shouldnt be in the delivering room. She has to do all the work for hours, it can go wrong and she needs emotional support to afront it.

I had an uneventful pregnancy and was young and healthy. My husband/best friend was the only one in the room. His complete support and comfort was why everything was ok. Labor is not a spectator sport. It is scary AF- even if it is your fourth, even if it is an easy pregnancy, even if you are young and healthy. YTA but you can change that and wait patiently outside of L&D", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You are are really minimizing what labor and childbirth is like. The support person is not there to watch the baby being born, they are there to provide emotional support to the mother and advocate for her. Take it from someone who has been through it 3 times, you do NOT want someone there that you do not fully trust and feel fully comfortable with. \nThe presence of someone you don\u2019t want there can actually increase stress and interfere with the process of labor. Midwives have been known to kick out out unsupportive people, it\u2019s not a spectator sport! There is actually a reason that it is the mother\u2019s choice and not an automatic right to the father. \nPriority does not go to the father, it goes to the person who is most able to make the person giving birth feel comfortable. In many cases, that person is also the father. In this case, it isn\u2019t. I can sympathize with his disappointment, but it is selfish for him to continue to pressure her.

I\u2019ve seen a lot of situations where clearly it is better for parents to split up.

I\u2019ve seen situations where it just causes a lot of stress due to the chaotic nature of having two homes.\n\nFrom my perspective, having two parents who can put aside their issues, preferably live in one home, and just focus on doing what\u2019s best for the child rather than trying to get back at their ex, is preferable. I also think it is preferable to have two parents only rather than step parents. Step parents are a mixed bag and you never know what you will get. The quality of the step parents are entirely dependent on the ability of the parents to select a partner and most people in divorced situations already have a poor record of this.\n\nI actually advocated for my mom to get a divorce when I was a teenager because my father was abusive. She was trying to make it work, but it just wasn\u2019t. She kicked him out and things got better. This still doesn\u2019t absolve her of her choices when it came to choosing a partner.
