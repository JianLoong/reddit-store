Your siblings are old enough and more than capable of picking up some slack. It shouldn't fall to only you because you're the oldest.", "NTA. But (assuming you're living there for free,) being 18 or older, those situations will keep coming up as long as you are financially dependent on them, so I would start trying to move out asap.

That's interesting.  She is used to you doing everything so when you say no or ask if someone else can do it, it seems like you are giving up and caring less, and disappointing her.  She needs to realize how much you do and how little the other do.  Your 18 y/o brother should be doing a lot.", "INFO: Does your or your brother have a job", "NTA.

As for your twelve year old sister, she can\u2019t help cook but she\u2019s old enough to help clean as well.\n\nYour mom screaming at you and insulting you is abusive behavior. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. I think it\u2019s time to start thinking of your plans for getting out. I see comments asking if you pay rent, and I understand why they are asking, but I also have to add that if your brother isn\u2019t expect to pay rent either, then it wouldn\u2019t be fair to expect you to do so if your mom has unfair expectations to where he doesn\u2019t pay rent, but he doesn\u2019t do his fair share of household responsibilities either.\n\nIf you have the means and the money, you should get out of there. If you don\u2019t, you need to start saving up so you can successfully get yourself out and into a place of your own.\n\nNo matter what your situation, you never deserve to be abused.

Your mother is way out of line for screaming abuse at you, you are  slightly out of line for yelling back (but you\u2019re 19, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anywhere near fair to judge you as harshly). Ignore EVERYONE who is asking if you pay rent. Whether you contribute financially to the household has no impact on the injustice of you having to take on the majority of household responsibility. Your brother is 18 ffs, get him off his ass and helping out. Even the 12 yr old can help with dishes or cleaning.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your only use to her in her mind is to be the cinderella of the family.  Best to move out asap and let her parent or pay for help.  Or heaven forbid actually have everyone pitch in.  \n\nAge and ability appropriate chores are great for all members of the household.  The fact it was only ever you held to doing them is a sign of a dysfunctional dynamic and it is best to remove yourself asap.  Even if you do the same for bad roommates at least them taking advantage of you isn\u2019t as horrific as your mom doing that.  It\u2019s so much worse when it\u2019s a parent doing this.  \n\nI remember telling people that it takes a lot to hurt me on a surface temporary level and it seems near impossible to hurt me permanently bc my mom already hurt me more than anyone else can.  Even if they do exactly the same it will never be close to what she did bc it\u2019s my mom who did it.  It messes you up on a basic foundational level.  Roommates would just be jerks.", "NTA\n\nLeave. I bet if you did all that cooking and cleaning for pay, you could probably afford to rent somewhere else.", "NTAAAAAAAAA get out as soon as possible.when I first met my wife,  she was living in a house with her 2 brothers and mom to help take care of the mom. I noticed that despite all the adults she was the only one to clean the house on a daily basis, cook every meal for them, run every errand despite the fact that there was other people to drive, pretty much kept her under their heels. I told her to stop and it took her a couple weeks of trying and she did. I showed her what a real family is and how important she is and that her needs matter. What's funny is we've been married for 7 years now (3kids 1 due dec8 via c section) had our own place the entire marriage and yet even though it's been about a decade since she moved out, they still ask her to do errands for them despite the fact they have their own vehicles and live an hour  away and she has told them no since we have lived together.", "NTA - write down all that you do every day. Keep a list.", "ESH - You are living at home, so helping around the house should be expected. Two wrongs don't make a right, so copying your siblings and refusing to help is not the right way to go about this. I would instead suggest that you discuss with your mother that if you are going to continue helping, it would be nice to see your brother helping with chores as well so you can see everyone is equally contributing. F12 is a different story. 12 year olds shouldn't be running a house, but every kid is old enough for chores. She could be doing something to help. Perhaps suggest a chores list which includes cooking and evenly split it up each week?", "YTA you live at home and your mom needed help...help her you will miss the chance to when she's gone", "Esh, you live there and as such should be helping with the day to day stuff. However  so should your siblings.", "Do you pay rent? If not then it\u2019s only fair to chip in with household stuff.

If talking to her doesn\u2019t fix the situation, then just move.", "The reason is in their underpants.\n\nAnd possibly OP has been easier to manipulate than her brother.

Your mom is for sure an ah for the way she talked to you, no arguing that. You are an adult and if you're not contributing financially you should be doing chores to contribute to the household regardless of whether you think it's fair or not.

I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s my mistake. I should have worded that better.\n\nI just meant that I wouldn\u2019t expect a 12 year old to cook a meal for the entire family.

You\u2019re probably still being financed by them. Sure it shouldn\u2019t fall solely on you. Do you work and pay rent?", "I could die first.
