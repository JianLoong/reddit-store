When I started elementary, my parents had gotten jobs that worked all morning and couldn't take care of us over the summer, so me and my brother would go to our Uncle's home. In the first few years, Uncle taught me many intermediate math skills. Elementary math classes came very easily to me as a result and quickly became known as the go-to math kid in my grade.\r  \n\r  \nHere's where I started to resent my Uncle and a bit of my parents. In my 2 middle-school years, my Uncle had planned vacations for the summer but recommended my parents a summer school and church nearby an Aunt's place, so I was sent there. From 8 am to 3 pm, I was in summer school with incredibly strict teachers, then after dismissal, I would be sent to the Church where I had various Christian activities until 8 pm (I'm not Christian). On top of all this, my Aunt who took care of us wanted us to be reading a lot and had me picking out 200+ page books to finish every week. It was a hellish couple of summers where I had become seriously depressed for years. I was just that done with any schooling and my grades made a huge dip for the rest of my time in school.\r  \n\r  \nIn the summer before my last year of middle school, Uncle was back to tutoring me again from 12pm to 9 pm in 4 out of the 7 days of the week. We did lengthy hours of Algebra and Geometry, Chinese, English, and Spanish lessons, and this time, a lot of coding. I showed a lot of talent in computer science, so computer science started getting hammered into me a lot more.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to Highschool, Uncle tutored me twice per week for 2 years when he found out I was in accelerated calculus and hired another tutor for an AP science class. Throughout all of it, I never asked for help, and always dreaded tutoring days since it meant it took hours out of my time to do stuff that I actually enjoyed. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m in college now, about to pick a major. When Uncle asked me about my major, I said \"Probably Graphic Design, but might swap to Computer Science if I don\u2019t like GD\" since I've already shown myself talented in coding and can fall back to it. Uncle responded with \"Take Computer science as a major, and minor in Graphic design, since CS will give you much more opportunities\". So now I'm being tutored again, this time for Python. I'm also supposed to learn Java and C++ on my own and test out of the first few classes at the start of next semester. I've been bored out of my mind and have been forgetting 90% of the lessons for far. I haven't done any self-study and am more focused on my 2 game tournaments and making gfx for a gaming org.\r  \n\r  \nI have an appointment with my college counselor in a couple of weeks to go over my plans. I'm more interested in GD, but I'm afraid it would cause a lot of tension since my Dad and Uncle are close and this will basically have wasted all of the summer lessons I was given.\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1689230817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yd7wq/wibta_for_wasting_years_of_my_uncles_tutoring_by/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm still working through my burnout but I've decided not to go back to the corporate world. I've got some ideas of what I want to do that will make me happy. My point is, you can choose a career path because your family expect it or it will make you a decent amount of money (the latter was my motivation) but if you do that, you're ultimately going to end up completely unsatisfied and probably suffering from mental health issues.

It\u2019s a very simple if statement: if you like to code, major in it; if not, don\u2019t do it. I also think that trying to test out of earlier courses is ruining the subject for you \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you are going to school, but when I took CS courses in the US, a lot of the intro courses were helpful for people who were on the fence about majoring in it. There\u2019s no point in getting a head start if you aren\u2019t sure about this path, so I would just tell your family to stop the tutoring. \n\nI\u2019m sure it would be totally cool with your counselor if you major in GD and take some CS courses to test the waters. When talking to your uncle, I\u2019d be upfront with him: you don\u2019t know if you would like CS, you are more interested in GD, so you\u2019ll major in GD and test out the waters with CS for now. If he asks why you don\u2019t want to be tutored, tell him that it\u2019s burning you out and you don\u2019t see a point to it anymore since you don\u2019t know if this is the path you want. He might be sad, insulted, or angry, but just be firm about your decision. Him tutoring you does not give him control of your career.\n\nI see some comments talking about compromising with UX or something, but you should only do that if you actually want to \u2014 none of what you do during college should be bc you want to make your parents happy. If you go down that route, you\u2019re gonna end up trying to appease them for your entire career. Sure, they might say that CS has a lot of job opportunity, but those jobs only make sense if you like to code, which you\u2019re still on the fence about. If you dislike coding, none of those supposed opportunities mean anything.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd it's not your uncles time that's been wasted but yours. Your uncle I an adult that was free to decide over his time. You've been a minor that was forced into taking all the tutoring.", "NTA.\n\nI dunno if your family would appreciate the sentiment (they don't seem to have cared about your feelings and interests much as you were growing up.) but I would suggest you reframe it to to at least yourself as \"This summer's tutoring was a helpful learning experience. I learned computer science is not for me and I would likely be miserable if I tried to major in it.\"\n\nNow you have more data to help you pick your major.", "Nta", "You are living your life not your uncles or your parents. NTA. The tutoring will not go to waste. Knowledge can be useful in many different phases of your life. NTA.", "NTA. You should be fine but I would figure out what you want todo with GD first. In the last few years I\u2019ve had quite a few friends graduate with graphic design degrees and their work prospects aren\u2019t the best.", "NTA- it's your life and you need to pursue what will make you happy", "I can\u2019t give an opinion since I don\u2019t know (and probably won\u2019t understand) the context. Does this happen in South Asia or other place where family has strong positions in everyone\u2019s lives? Also amount of tutoring you have been through is just staggering to me. How on earth your parents can afford that all? How come your opinion has never before been asked? What?", "Okay, I am relevant!\nI was groomed for work in history. I was given money for it, I studied it and loved it i even got several jobs in the field. My field went bottoms up due to industry waves about 6 years ago, so I took the skills I learned on my job (archaeology) and went into cartography. I make maps for a living, part of that meant I had to learn to code- python, html/css, geojson, arcade, bevause that was *the way to get a job*. I now use AI for my coding since AI can whip up a good code for me but you need to understand your coding language because AI messes it up the longer the code and you need to know your syntax to get good results. I also use AI to help me make pretty maps but I know what makes a pretty map and how to manipulate the AI. These problems I experience won't be problems on 3-5 years. People won't need to understand how the code works to get working code or to fix it. \n\n\nMy advice? Take graphic design and run with it into computer sciences or an AI course with graphic design. Do a major and a minor or a double major. It isn't just *what* you study in school, it's *what* makes you employable and can give you a future. Look at future trends because the technological landscape is changing rapidly with anything to do with technology. Don't look at a job you want today because that job could not exist in 3 years. You look at the skills you have with what you want to do, and then you reach out to professors and industry specialists. \n\n\nYou would not be the asshole for not wanting the path they laid out for you. You would be the asshole if you took on 100k of student debt to find out your degree will get you nowhere.

Most GD work is GUI design and not really fun art projects you choose. \n\nYou could also get GD work with a minor but not necessarily a network engineer or coding script work with a GD major, etc.", "NTA.  You get to choose your path in life.  You didn't ask for all those lessons & tutoring, they were forced on you.  No one can force you to choose a major.  This is all your decision.  And if dad & uncle don't like it, that's their problem to deal with.  If you decide GD isn't for you, you can probably switch majors.  Talk to your counselor & do what feels right for you.", "NTA\n\nPick something you **want** to do.

While this is probably an overstatement, for the most part it has been true in my life as an engineer. Graphic Design is math.  Animation is calculus. IF OP is interested in graphic design, uncle's efforts are not \"wasted\", they are a firm foundation for future success.  \n\nThank uncle for the basics that he has provided, and discuss how you have used what he taught you to relate to what you are studying.

I am sure you wont be asking if u are an asshole when u graduate with major in CS and minor in GD and earn 150k.", "NTA, it's your life to live.\n\nNow, to share some of my background that's related to your college coursework. I took to coding pretty easily going into college but was also interested in art. I'm currently a graphic designer (professionally), so that's the route I took. It's a very competitive field, but I'm not trying to talk you out of it.\n\nWhat you MIGHT enjoy, depending on how much enjoyment you get out of coding, is a career as a technical artist. It's a bit of a hybrid career between design and coding. My degree is a B.S. in Computer Graphics Technology, and while I am primarily a front-end creative in my day-to-day work, having that background in the development side of graphics tech makes it easy to understand file formats, compression, web-technology, and so on.\n\nNow, maybe developing rendering engines and shaders isn't as creatively exciting as you're looking for, but if you end up in Graphic Design you're likely going to encounter UI/UX projects, either mobile apps or website design, so you'll hybrid the skillsets as an almost guarantee.\n\nPerhaps you can ease the tension by explaining to your Uncle the crossover careers like this and that the experience he gave you will be valuable. You don't ultimately have to find that career that blends them, but I can promise you having some understanding of the back-end of the technology will make your front-end design skills VERY transferrable between platforms.\n\nAs a side note, if you have a creative eye you can self-learn a lot about design, and most employers/clients will care more about your portfolio than your academic credentials.\n\nIf you have any questions about the industry, I'd be happy to answer them!", "NTA. You're an adult now. You get to make your own decisions.", "NTA, and all those tutoring hours will never go to waste, it sounds like you developed a crazy strong work ethic and resilience. That will make you awesome on any path you choose to take.\n\nGood luck with handling things with your family.", "Tf.... your dad and uncle aren't the ones who will be paying your bills...", "Exactly this! It sounds like OP\u2019s uncle is still tutoring them, whether they want it or not, and I\u2019d just like to point out to OP, you are an adult now. You don\u2019t have to accept tutoring you don\u2019t want that will not be useful to you. Yes, your uncle won\u2019t like it. Yes, it will likely start a family fight. But you are the one who has to live this life. It should be the life YOU want to live, not the life other people have imagined for you. \n\nWhen I was around OP\u2019s age, my mom told me \u201cjust because you\u2019re good at something doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it for the rest of your life.\u201d OP is good at math and programming, but being good at it doesn\u2019t obligate them to do it forever."]}
