When I started elementary, my parents had gotten jobs that worked all morning and couldn't take care of us over the summer, so me and my brother would go to our Uncle's home. In the first few years, Uncle taught me many intermediate math skills. Elementary math classes came very easily to me as a result and quickly became known as the go-to math kid in my grade.\r  \n\r  \nHere's where I started to resent my Uncle and a bit of my parents. In my 2 middle-school years, my Uncle had planned vacations for the summer but recommended my parents a summer school and church nearby an Aunt's place, so I was sent there. From 8 am to 3 pm, I was in summer school with incredibly strict teachers, then after dismissal, I would be sent to the Church where I had various Christian activities until 8 pm (I'm not Christian). On top of all this, my Aunt who took care of us wanted us to be reading a lot and had me picking out 200+ page books to finish every week. It was a hellish couple of summers where I had become seriously depressed for years. I was just that done with any schooling and my grades made a huge dip for the rest of my time in school.\r  \n\r  \nIn the summer before my last year of middle school, Uncle was back to tutoring me again from 12pm to 9 pm in 4 out of the 7 days of the week. We did lengthy hours of Algebra and Geometry, Chinese, English, and Spanish lessons, and this time, a lot of coding. I showed a lot of talent in computer science, so computer science started getting hammered into me a lot more.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to Highschool, Uncle tutored me twice per week for 2 years when he found out I was in accelerated calculus and hired another tutor for an AP science class. Throughout all of it, I never asked for help, and always dreaded tutoring days since it meant it took hours out of my time to do stuff that I actually enjoyed. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m in college now, about to pick a major. When Uncle asked me about my major, I said \"Probably Graphic Design, but might swap to Computer Science if I don\u2019t like GD\" since I've already shown myself talented in coding and can fall back to it. Uncle responded with \"Take Computer science as a major, and minor in Graphic design, since CS will give you much more opportunities\". So now I'm being tutored again, this time for Python. I'm also supposed to learn Java and C++ on my own and test out of the first few classes at the start of next semester. I've been bored out of my mind and have been forgetting 90% of the lessons for far. I haven't done any self-study and am more focused on my 2 game tournaments and making gfx for a gaming org.\r  \n\r  \nI have an appointment with my college counselor in a couple of weeks to go over my plans. I'm more interested in GD, but I'm afraid it would cause a lot of tension since my Dad and Uncle are close and this will basically have wasted all of the summer lessons I was given.\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1689230817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14yd7wq/wibta_for_wasting_years_of_my_uncles_tutoring_by/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you've used the word torture to describe it and your talk about it making you depressed automatically makes you NTA. I am 43 years old and earlier this year, I quit my job as a corporate accountant due to anxiety and a massive burnout. I'm still working through my burnout but I've decided not to go back to the corporate world. I've got some ideas of what I want to do that will make me happy. My point is, you can choose a career path because your family expect it or it will make you a decent amount of money (the latter was my motivation) but if you do that, you're ultimately going to end up completely unsatisfied and probably suffering from mental health issues. You're going to spend a good portion of your life at work, find something that you want to do and do that. By the sound of it, you excel at everything you try so I'm sure that GD will be no exception. Good luck xxx", "NTA \n\nCollege is for yourself and want your interests are, not the one of your uncle and parents.

Lots of that stuff will be helpful to you in your education and life.\nLastly, you\u2019ve been burnt out by their absurd schedule and expectations as a child when you didn\u2019t have the choice. You\u2019re an adult now. You have a choice. Do not choose misery over happiness.", "NTA. I get that he is pushing you hard, but ultimately, it\u2019s your life. You are allowed to pick your career path. Go into a field that you love because work is less of a hassle when you love what you do.\n\nIf you want to appease your family, double major so they get what they want and you get what you want.

It\u2019s a very simple if statement: if you like to code, major in it; if not, don\u2019t do it. I also think that trying to test out of earlier courses is ruining the subject for you \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you are going to school, but when I took CS courses in the US, a lot of the intro courses were helpful for people who were on the fence about majoring in it. There\u2019s no point in getting a head start if you aren\u2019t sure about this path, so I would just tell your family to stop the tutoring. \n\nI\u2019m sure it would be totally cool with your counselor if you major in GD and take some CS courses to test the waters. When talking to your uncle, I\u2019d be upfront with him: you don\u2019t know if you would like CS, you are more interested in GD, so you\u2019ll major in GD and test out the waters with CS for now. If he asks why you don\u2019t want to be tutored, tell him that it\u2019s burning you out and you don\u2019t see a point to it anymore since you don\u2019t know if this is the path you want. He might be sad, insulted, or angry, but just be firm about your decision. Him tutoring you does not give him control of your career.\n\nI see some comments talking about compromising with UX or something, but you should only do that if you actually want to \u2014 none of what you do during college should be bc you want to make your parents happy. If you go down that route, you\u2019re gonna end up trying to appease them for your entire career. Sure, they might say that CS has a lot of job opportunity, but those jobs only make sense if you like to code, which you\u2019re still on the fence about. If you dislike coding, none of those supposed opportunities mean anything.", "NTA\n\n\nAnd it's not your uncles time that's been wasted but yours.

You've been a minor that was forced into taking all the tutoring.", "NTA.\n\nI dunno if your family would appreciate the sentiment (they don't seem to have cared about your feelings and interests much as you were growing up.) but I would suggest you reframe it to to at least yourself as \"This summer's tutoring was a helpful learning experience. I learned computer science is not for me and I would likely be miserable if I tried to major in it.\"\n\nNow you have more data to help you pick your major.", "Nta", "You are living your life not your uncles or your parents.
