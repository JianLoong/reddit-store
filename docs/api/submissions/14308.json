I am close friends/coworkers with my cousin\u2019s wife R.\n\nT & M work 6 figure jobs, but A has a business that pulls in 3 million. T & M hired a surrogate and A signed a waiver which stated she had no legal responsibilities to any children produced from her eggs. A set up a college fund of $100k for the first baby who is perfectly healthy and thriving. The second baby was born with MCDK and it\u2019s been months of dialysis and now they\u2019re talking about kidney transplants. Baby M had to be hospitalized again recently and the doctor believes they should go to a hospital in a different state for specialized treatment.\n\nYesterday, everyone gathered at A and R\u2019s house. T was saying that A should step up more by offering more financial assistance, that baby M will face a lifetime of medical issues and she can clearly afford it. He is baby M\u2019s bio father. A was very offended by this saying she had been more than generous throughout this whole process and she didn\u2019t have to provide the college fund for baby K or any money for baby M. T said that A is a heartless monster and wouldn\u2019t care if baby M died. A was a little drunk and said while why should I foot the bill for the rest of my life when I never wanted kids anyway, I worked hard for my money and you can always have another baby. Everyone was stunned. A excused herself and R was crying. T left after that and I went into the guest room. \n\nLater R came in and apologized but asked what I thought. I agree with A, legally she has no obligation to the babies although she shouldn\u2019t have said it like that. I feel like T & M should have prepared for something like this and both of them make 6 figures! R was upset, saying she could not believe I thought like that, every life is precious, I\u2019m just like A. R absolutely adores babies, while A can\u2019t stand them. A made it clear before that she would have no involvement with the babies lives and A has never seen baby M and only attended baby K\u2019s 1st birthday party so I don\u2019t blame her for doing exactly what she said she would do. I texted A a message of support saying I really don\u2019t think she did anything wrong, it\u2019s not her child legally, and I would have done the same thing.\n\nNow R is not speaking to me and A is a mess. I\u2019m dreading going back to work on Monday bc R is very open and I kinda don\u2019t want my coworkers to judge me because technically A is right, they can just have another baby, and A didn\u2019t sign up to bankroll this kid for life.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680981909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fvsgw/aita_for_saying_my_cousin_is_not_responsible_for/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She went above her responsibility as an egg donor.
