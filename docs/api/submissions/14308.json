I am close friends/coworkers with my cousin\u2019s wife Rose.\n\nTom & Mike both work jobs that pay 6 figures, but Amy has a business that pulls in ~3 million/year. Tom & Mike hired a surrogate and Amy signed a waiver which stated she had no legal responsibilities to any children produced from her eggs. Amy set up a college fund of $100k for the first baby who is perfectly healthy and thriving. The second baby (Mae) was born with MCDK and it\u2019s been months of dialysis and now they\u2019re talking about kidney transplants. Baby Mae had to be hospitalized again recently and the doctor believes they should go to a hospital in a different state for specialized treatment.\n\nYesterday, everyone gathered at Amy and Rose\u2019s house. Tom was saying that Amy should step up more by offering more financial assistance, that Mae will face a lifetime of medical issues and she can clearly afford it. He is baby Mae\u2019s bio father. Amy was very offended by this saying she had been more than generous throughout this whole process and she didn\u2019t have to provide the college fund for baby 1 or anything for Mae. Tom said that Amy is a heartless monster and wouldn\u2019t care if Mae died. Amy was a little drunk and said while why should I foot the bill for the rest of my life when I never wanted kids anyway, I worked hard for my money and you can always have another baby. Everyone was stunned. Amy excused herself and Rose was crying. Tom left after that and I went into the guest room. \n\nLater Rose came in and apologized but asked what I thought. I agree with Amy, legally she has no obligation to the babies although she shouldn\u2019t have said it like that. I feel like Tom & Mike should have prepared for something like this and both of them make 6 figures! Rose was upset, saying she could not believe I thought like that, every life is precious, I\u2019m just like Amy. Rose absolutely adores babies, while Amy can\u2019t stand them. Amy made it clear before the babies were born that she would have no involvement with the babies lives and Amy has never seen Mae and only attended the first baby\u2019s 1st birthday party so I don\u2019t blame her for doing exactly what she said she would do. I texted Amy a message of support saying I really don\u2019t think she did anything wrong, it\u2019s not her child legally, and I would have done the same thing.\n\nNow Rose is not speaking to me and Amy is a mess. I\u2019m dreading going back to work on Monday bc Rose is very open and I kinda don\u2019t want my coworkers to judge me because technically Amy is right, they can just have another baby, and Amy didn\u2019t sign up to bankroll this kid for life.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: changed initials to fake names", "created_utc": 1680981909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fvsgw/aita_for_saying_my_cousin_is_not_responsible_for/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. But everyone was well aware moving into this that she had zero interest in children and sero maternal instinct, shes also never met the child.

At all times, no matter how much money or time or other resources that person has. \nSame goes towards her, she can\u2019t make an claim to want to have an motherrole in the child\u2019s life, the fathers need to trust they are protected at that front.", "Everyone is reading into this as guilt tripping bio-mom. But I'm reading it more as \"guilt tripping rich aunt.\"  It's her wife's brother and husband kid, I.e. her niece.", "Amy donated eggs to two seperate gay couples\n\nGC #1 (1 baby)\n\nGc #2 (1 baby) \n\nSigned away parental rights/responsibilities\n\nGC #2 baby is sick and they hold Amy should fork up cash or be a bad mom\n\nAmy holds she isn't anyone's mom", ">why didn\u2019t R donate her eggs? \n\nSo that brother and sister can be biological parents? Ewww.", "R (Rose) is Amy's wife, and I got from the spot that Rose is not child free while Amy is, so Rose is emotionally dealing with \"I'm never going to be a parent but I desperately want to be, and my partner thinks sick children should just be replaced with a newer model like it's no big deal.\"", "Wow. It's her niece, she's allowed to be upset that her wife doesn't care if the baby dies.", "It is baffling to me that you're getting downvoted for this.", "You\u2019re right. She should have never set up that college fund because it made the dads more entitled to her money\u2026. As if she hasn\u2019t given enough. Was the comment out of line? To some, sure. Buts no matter what she says SHES RIGHT! They shouldn\u2019t have kids they can\u2019t afford & she shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill for a kid that ain\u2019t hers, she didn\u2019t want & LEGALLY has ZERO obligation to. Period.", "I think that Amy only said the shitty \"you can have another kid\" after being pressed way too far by the fathers. While it would be nice for her to put up a similar amount in a fund for the second child, it was a gift and not a demand. The reason it's not ESH is because the parents are acting far worse with their entitlement demanding financial support.", "No not two separate couple, its the same couple", "A week in hospital for a sick child in the usa could be over 100k omg it's crazy.", "I should have be more clear. Why weren\u2019t Rose and Mike the bio parents. Then the baby would have been related to both men biologically.", "Going to be cynical here, but large possibility that it was exactly for the scenarios that have happened. Amy's eggs = Amy's money for college/medical needs/fancy gifts.\n\nThere was potentially a possibility for both kids to come from r's eggs and be fathered by the brothers husband, so either they wanted to try for a child each (the nicer scenario) or they thought they'd secure a lifetime bankroll. Like I said before it's the more cynical view but the post already leans that way.", "Well sister and BIL would be the pairing", "Once again the real asshole is the American medical system", "You can be right and still be an ah. But treating your nieces differently by giving one 100k and the other you don't care if they die? Yeah you're a bit of an ah even if you're right. Everyone here is an ah honestly and these poor kids", "Nothing makes that ok - what she said. The dads also suck for what they did but gifting one niece 100k and saying fuck off to the other isn't cool, that money should've been split at the very least.", "Oh both gay couples is amy+wife rose\nTom+Mike\n\nChange my mind that was awkwardly written.\n\nPlus amy having wife is irrelevant to issue.", "Thank God OP put names in, it was so confusing. Rose and Tom are brother and sister. Tom is the biological father. Soiree1999 suggested that Rose donate eggs.", "That's true, no parents should be worried about money with a sick child, but our society is incredibly broken.", "Yeah because IVF is free everywhere else lol", "It was to show the family connection. Amy wife brother was who got the eggs from Amy. \n\nIt definitely was awkwardly written. I had to double check before I responded to you.", "That had me confused, I didn't realize OP was listing Amy & Rose as one of the gay couples LOL", "Yes, with the implication that if she did so they'd use her brother's husband's sperm instead of her brother's.", "Most countries you want to be compared with have it free or insured at low cost, the rest are not worth comparing to.", "It is in some countries but if it\u2019s successful you have to give up the rights to your unused embryos"]}
