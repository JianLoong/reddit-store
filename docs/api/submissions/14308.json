I am close friends/coworkers with my cousin\u2019s wife Rose.\n\nTom & Mike both work jobs that pay 6 figures, but Amy has a business that pulls in ~3 million/year. Tom & Mike hired a surrogate and Amy signed a waiver which stated she had no legal responsibilities to any children produced from her eggs. Amy set up a college fund of $100k for the first baby who is perfectly healthy and thriving. The second baby (Mae) was born with MCDK and it\u2019s been months of dialysis and now they\u2019re talking about kidney transplants. Baby Mae had to be hospitalized again recently and the doctor believes they should go to a hospital in a different state for specialized treatment.\n\nYesterday, everyone gathered at Amy and Rose\u2019s house. Tom was saying that Amy should step up more by offering more financial assistance, that Mae will face a lifetime of medical issues and she can clearly afford it. He is baby Mae\u2019s bio father. Amy was very offended by this saying she had been more than generous throughout this whole process and she didn\u2019t have to provide the college fund for baby 1 or anything for Mae. Tom said that Amy is a heartless monster and wouldn\u2019t care if Mae died. Amy was a little drunk and said while why should I foot the bill for the rest of my life when I never wanted kids anyway, I worked hard for my money and you can always have another baby. Everyone was stunned. Amy excused herself and Rose was crying. Tom left after that and I went into the guest room. \n\nLater Rose came in and apologized but asked what I thought. I agree with Amy, legally she has no obligation to the babies although she shouldn\u2019t have said it like that. I feel like Tom & Mike should have prepared for something like this and both of them make 6 figures! Rose was upset, saying she could not believe I thought like that, every life is precious, I\u2019m just like Amy. Rose absolutely adores babies, while Amy can\u2019t stand them. Amy made it clear before the babies were born that she would have no involvement with the babies lives and Amy has never seen Mae and only attended the first baby\u2019s 1st birthday party so I don\u2019t blame her for doing exactly what she said she would do. I texted Amy a message of support saying I really don\u2019t think she did anything wrong, it\u2019s not her child legally, and I would have done the same thing.\n\nNow Rose is not speaking to me and Amy is a mess. I\u2019m dreading going back to work on Monday bc Rose is very open and I kinda don\u2019t want my coworkers to judge me because technically Amy is right, they can just have another baby, and Amy didn\u2019t sign up to bankroll this kid for life.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: changed initials to fake names", "created_utc": 1680981909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fvsgw/aita_for_saying_my_cousin_is_not_responsible_for/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
