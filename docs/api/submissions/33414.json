Me and my sister have a really good relationship and she is mostly comfortable telling me things that she doesn\u2019t tell anyone else. \n\nI am worried about her being active and feel like a parent has to be involved on this but I\u2019m not sure what the best way to approach this is. \n\nI am also worried about losing her trust and her not talking to me anymore.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the replies so far. First post here and realized I need to provide more info, sorry. \n\nMy little sister is 13 years old in middle school. Her bf is the same age as her and they go to school together. My mom is aware that she has a boyfriend and she has met him. \n\nMy mom is also worried about her at this age because my mom was a teenage parent at 15 years old. She doesn\u2019t want my sister to be a young parent like her but also feels like starting her on birth control (implant) is basically giving her the go ahead, but she\u2019d rather be safe than sorry and is strongly considering it. \n\nMy mom and sister have a good relationship but she doesn\u2019t tell my mom a lot because my sister is at that age where people start keeping secrets from their parents and feel like they need a little independence, regular teen/preteen things. My mom wasn\u2019t around a lot when my sister was young and I had to step in to help raise my sister. My mom is around a lot more now but still preoccupied with other things and we\u2019ve always come second it feels like to me, she just never has the time to deal with problems and just dishes out quick punishments. \n\nMy sister would absolute stop talking to me about personal things if she found out I told my mom. I don\u2019t want that because I feel my sister needs someone that she feels she can trust enough to talk about things. \n\nI am very conflicted and also worried about my sister. I know she will grow up eventually and that\u2019s fine I just want to make sure she is safe", "created_utc": 1703050922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mn6t6/aita_if_i_tell_mom_my_little_sister_13yo_has_a/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I had a \"bf\" when I was her age and really wished I had an older sibling to step in or at least check up on me and now that I have younger siblings I would definitely see what was going on.", "NTA. The fact that you\u2019re clearly worried and concerned about even losing her trust if you did that shows you 1) want her to be able to trust you with serious things 2) that\u2019s your conflicted on how to best deal with this for her safety 3) lastly your asking when not sure for advice before acting, which is very showing of your character.\n\nI personally think you should try to handle it yourself and talk to her. She\u2019s young to things might not stick and go in one ear and out the other. When I was 13 when I made mistakes the only thing I really wanted to was to not feel judged. Or like my parents would hate me. Because at that age everything is the end of the world. I suggest approaching her in a way where u let her know right of the rip your not here to judge your here for guidance and a person to talk to. And that u genuinely will only tell her what\u2019s good for her. And be very thorough in relaying this info. And also assure her not to be scared to tell you. That it will only stay between you. I remember being 13 and having kissed a boy for the first time I was scared shitless of my dad. Even though he wouldn\u2019t judge me he would only guide me that initial fear is there.\n\nYou seem like a great big brother. But try creating that relationship where your her confidant.

A parent really should know.  No idea the home situation she lives in and what family dynamics are like as you didn't include anything about that in your post.  That being said if it's not ideal and you think her shutting down communication all together is a real possibility because of potential fallout from your mom she may face then maybe you can consider making sure she's safe with what she's doing.  If you mom ever finds that out though you could get some blow back.  \n\n\nOf course you need to step in and tell your mom if whoever she is messing with could be considered to have be molesting a child or committing statutory rape.  Often times for kids as young as your sister a lot of jurisdiction have age limits on how old their partner can legally be.  This is to make sure they aren't being sexually groomed and/or abused.", "NTA.

Ultimately, it is her choice, so if she decides she is ready to have sex, provide her with the safety tools to not become a child-parent.\n\nGive her support and love.", "Don't tell your mom. You would break your sisters trust. Could you give her the talk? How to use protection. And maybe buy her condoms to use, if they get active. Show her on a banana how to use this kind of protection. If you don't feel confortable to talk to her abaut this stuff (or just don't know enough about the female stuff), maybe look up some you tubes about this topic and ask her, to watch it. Just in case the sex ED in her school is not up to the topic.\n\nIt is better to be save than sorry. And it would be best, if she is able to talk to you about this things. So she woulld have someone if sh\\*t hits the fan. If there was an accidant and she would need the pill after, if her boyfriend might want to move faster than her, stuff like that. It is important to have someone to talk to, don't break this trust.\n\nMaybe if you can't talkt to her, hint to your mother if she has given your sister 'the talk' because your sister has a boyfriend (no secret, because she knows about him)", "NTA.

Consider that you've done a significant amount of caregiving for this Sister and established a bond complete with trust; so capitalize on it.

To put it another way, how sure are you that if you told your mom, your sister would find out? I suppose this also depends not only on the potential for her to have noticed but also on her ability to be discreet or subtle.", "NTA, but I personally wouldn't. I would talk to your mom, giving her no new information, but just say to her that with your sisters boyfriend you think it's time for a visit to the doctor to get some birth control.", "It's really weird to me that you're (and others here too) concerned about a hickey? Idk, her boyfriend is the same age, discovering your sexuality during puberty with peers your age is perfectly normal, right? I definitely remember middle school makeouts and still waited until 16 to have sex and I still don't have kids. \n\nIf you're as close as you say, I think you should be about to talk to her and give her good advice without betraying her trust.", "YWBTA, but only lightly. I get where you are coming from, but you don't want her to start not telling you personal things. But for god's sake get her sex ed and try and convince your mum to get her on birth control. Also, get her a supply of condoms, just incase. It probably hasn't gone further then making out, but better safe than sorry.", "Info: A hickey doesn\u2019t mean sex. Did she tell you she\u2019s sexually active, or is this an assumption?", "NTA, you have concerning knowledge about sexual activity at 13. Sister needs proper education and guidance, and she is irrational, myopic, and ungrateful if she rebels and turns it down. It is worth risking your relationship with her to spare her the consequences of some really bad decisions.", "Considering you\u2019ve been more of a parent to her than your mother, I wouldn\u2019t tell her. I\u2019d rather keep the trust, because you never know what might happen. \n\nIn terms of birth control, yes, absolutely! Whether it\u2019s considered a \u201cgo ahead\u201d or not, she\u2019ll probably take that step when she wants to anyway. It would be best if she were on birth control when she does.", "Talk to her about condoms", "NTA, I would talk to your sister about this first though see what you can do. Talk to her about safe sex, get her condoms. You can\u2019t stop her from having sex but maybe you can get her a birth control to hopefully stop her from getting pregnant. Also check your country/state laws. My big sister took me to planned parenthood to get on birth control before I even had sex because in my state you can be 15 to get on bc without parent permission, I just had to make sure I knew my social security.", "No.. not really but expect pushback", "NTA but definitely keep it between you and her. When I was younger someone betrayed my trust in that way and I never told them secrets ever again. Birth control is a good idea. While some see giving teens condoms and birth control as giving permission, I think it\u2019s better to be safe than be pregnant. Especially since teenagers are going to do it regardless of protection. Good on you for looking out for your little sister, I think she\u2019ll appreciate advice coming from you rather than a scolding from mom.", "Am I the only one weirded out you saw your 13yo sisters chest? At first I was like oh \"chest\" like up top but then I read  some comments and saw you flat out say BREAST... Like why were you in a position to see her without a shirt on...and if she WAS wearing a shirt then why were you looking at her breasts...the math ain't mathing", "It sounds like your mother is thinking about this already. YWBTA to lose your sister's confidence over a hickey. I would be more concerned if she didn't have a boyfriend and had a hickey.", "YTA. Talk to her about it first. If you think she will be punished by your parents don\u2019t tell them. Punishment likely wont deter any sexual activity. I think the best move for you would be talking to her yourself. Talk to her about consent and consent laws wherever you are. Talk to her about safe sex and how serious STD\u2019s and pregnancy are. If you don\u2019t want to talk to her about it because it isn\u2019t necessarily your responsibility. You can ask your mom to without telling her any sensitive information. Just say \u201chey mom, have you had THE talk with my sister yet? She\u2019s at an age where I think she would benefit from a deep conversation about it\u201d. Likely your sister would listen better to you (her peer) than your guy\u2019s mom as well so I do encourage you to talk to her even though it may be awkward. She may not even be having sex and just thought it was \u201ccool\u201d to have a hickey.", "This isn't about the hickey. Those are totally normal at that age. And your mom doesn't need to know.\n\nBut you should make certain your sister is educated about birth control and consent.", "If you noticed she has a hickey won\u2019t your mom notice too? If so, that\u2019ll take care of itself. If not, maybe ask your sister what she plans to do about that hickey? Something like -\n\u201care you going to try to cover it up? Cuz mom won\u2019t like seeing that\u201d or something along those lines, whatever u feel is appropriate. \n\nThat will open the door to a conversation I think. From there you can maybe just reassure her that this type of stuff is normal, but maybe tell her to be safe, and since she\u2019s a girl, pull the big brother card. Tell her if any guy (including her bf) makes her feel uncomfortable or makes her feel pressured, that you\u2019ll be there to help her if she needs it.\n\nAnd I\u2019d definitely bring up condoms as a way of being safe if she does allude to being sexually active at all, they protect against STD\u2019s AND unwanted pregnancies so that\u2019s the best option for her.\n\nAlso, she doesn\u2019t necessarily need to go to the doctors to get birth control. If she\u2019s willing, there\u2019s a website called hellowisp.com that helps women access different types of medications (if you\u2019re in the U.S.), including birth control, that could really be beneficial for her!\n\nEDIT: just realized Wisp does require users to be at least 18 though so you may need to use someone else\u2019s ID to get birth control off that website.", "NTA, this is about the safety of a child.

It is a hard skill to master, even as an adult,  but especially for a young child that likely have to hide them for the parents, on vacations, from the school, and such. \n\nBecause of reason like that, at such at that age, both (pill plus condom) would be ideal, but at that tender age kids are dumb (hence, not having sex yet would be preferred), but it is naive to assumed they wont, just because we think they are too young.", ">I'm not sure if even the most well-meaning guy is fully equipped to give \"the talk\" to a 13yo sister, and buying a 13yo condoms feels a step too far and in the wrong direction. At that age, boundaries and maybe even some new rules about seeing a bf unsupervised seem more appropriate, not encouraging her to explore to the fullest extent.\n\nA guy will not be able to give all the information for a girl, yes I agree. But at least the basics - use protections! Don't do anything you don't want to. No means no - from you and from him. This are ways to get pregnant, this are ways not to. \n\nAnd no, buying condoms for your sister so she will be safe is not going too far. It shows first that it is nothing to be embaraced to buy (better buy condoms than diapers!) and for many teens it feels awkward to go to the store to buy some. So they don't buy them - so they don't use them. So the get pregnant. So giving them the option 'he, tell me and I buy it for you' or even better 'I  don't think you should have sex but I was a teen too, so if you need them, here is a package of condoms. Please be save. And if you need more and you don't want to ask for it, just put the empty box on my desk. No questions ask.'", "She is a little too young, but she still is at that age in which is understandable she is becoming sexually curious. A hickey doesnt equal sex, neither is a sign of inminent sex. But it is a sign of her boyfriend inexperience. \n\nTalk to her. It is unavoidable that she will eventually have sex, and that's ok. Her sexuality is not something she should be ashame of. \n\nBut talk to her also about something different than diseases and unwanted pregnancy. Ask her how she feels. Get to know her boyfriend. Explain how much intimacy and vulnerability sex involves. Talk to her about social pressure and consent, how important it is not to feel pressure to do anything, that she should be safe, and protected, and loved. \n\nThere's so often people to talk us about safe sex but there are rarely adults in our lives to which we cant turn to talk about the emotional aspects of our safety.

You can only make it to where they can be as safe as possible while doing it.", "Is she having sex or just doing age-appropriate sexual exploration, ie kissing and hickeys?", "The pills are the way to go.

My main motivation there was just that he alone likely isn't equipped to give her everything she needs. But those basics are essential and he should absolutely be doing that!\n\nI appreciate your thoughts on this, and I agree it's a tricky issue. As a parent, you absolutely need to be trustworthy and not be overbearing, but you also need to make sure you don't give too much freedom too fast, as both can be unhealthy. I don't think making condoms (and conversation!) available is inherently wrong, but needing them at that age is also very much a behavior I think should be discouraged. How to prevent bad choices from happening while also being open enough to be there to assist with the consequences is a tough line to walk. It's a really nuanced subject, and tough because the best approach can differ for every kid.", "Very well written, thank you. At her age I knew about safe sex but not how to stand up for myself when first BF wanted to go too fast and I asked him to stop and he disagreed. So... then what are you supposed to do? I was taught to be a \"nice\" girl, who obeyed \"turn the other cheek\" instead of raising a hand to hurt someone, and that if I was well behaved that boys would just \"respect\" me. \n\nNo person or book ever went into detail about how to say no, or that it was okay to go, \"okay this isn't what I want.\"  Nobody taught me that my opinion mattered as much as a boy I thought I was in love with-- every media source is about true love is something you \"give your all for\" or \"sacrifice for\" as a girl-- and that gets confusing. Nobody told me how to make sure I wasn't in an unsafe situation where he couldn't stop me from leaving or protesting, and I sure as heck didn't know how to fight back!", ">If the parent is a good parent, their answer should be the same. \"We want you to be safe, here's how and here's the resources you need.\"\n\nThat's just not true, or in the very least it's misleading. That's treating a child like a short adult. At younger ages, children are incapable of being trusted with their own safety. Parents put boundaries in place, and independence is earned and gained as children mature and prove capable of handling more and more freedom. The switch from \"you're not allowed unsupervised with boys or strangers\" and \"Here's how to put on a condom, please be safe!\" is far more a spectrum with growing independence than it is a switch that gets flipped one day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OP is the trusted adult in this kid's life.

It's hard to tell if OP is just being extra cautious or if there is genuine cause for concern. That's likely too much nuance for a reddit post. I absolutely agree OP needs to handle this carefully and delicately, but I'm not sure if full *carte blanche* is the best way to go either.", "Oh well if the rule says it's ok, that's all that matters!", "Also apparently the boyfriend is the same age as her.", "Hickey's is NOT something a 13 year old should be giving/receiving.

But just say 'no you can't' just make the fruit more forbidden to some. So talking open about it, might be the best way. Also to protect her. As you say it is a really nuanced subject and often a tabu topic to talk about with older persons you are not involved with. But sometime talking to them, knowing 'the don't judge me, just because I'm young' can be really important. Especially if there are situations she doesn't know how to handle 'like her boyfriend tries to pressure her to get to this stuff faster', or if there was an accident without protection. Knowing to have someone to talk to about this stuff, who wil not start with 'you are too young!' and therefor break all the confident it takes a young teen to talk about this topics before she can even start.\n\nOr what would you do to stop her from doing stupid things?", "There's not a way to stop your teenager from having sex completely. If they're already expressing an interest in that, all you can do is offer them resources they need to be their safest. Banning sex does not lead to kids having less sex, it leads to kids having unsafe sex and sneaking around behind your back. It also leads to them not feeling able to tell you if complications occur from having sex.", "Haha oh I wish I had all the answers, and I appreciate your discussion of this.\n\nIn general, I think the best way to operate with boundaries is to make them a discussion that you work on together. Share your perspective, ask theirs. Tell them what needs to be achieved (safety, acceptable grades, no teen pregnancies, etc), share your idea for helping making it happen (curfews, restrictions on dating or alone time with partners, bedtimes, etc) and give them the option to present something different. \n\nMy main complaint with threads like these is that some people seem quick to just say \"Give them the sex talk, give them condoms, and trust that they'll be smart! After all, they'll just break the rules if you try and do anything other than bend over backward to their whims!\"", "True, there's no way to completely stop a kid from doing something, but as I said, it's not an \"all or nothing.\" Curfews, location sharing, limited freedom with unsupervised \"partner\" time are all reasonable boundaries for a 13 yo to have. You can emphasize the importance of being discerning and safe while also discouraging the practice or limiting the potential for it. \n\nOverall, I think these threads and reddit in general have far too strong a tendency to treat children as short adults that are fully capable and trustworthy of using the resources they are given.", "I agree. It is not enough just to give them condoms and think now all the parenting is done. \n\nI don't know if OP has the authority to give his sister rules for being with her boyfriend and if he even wants this role. \n\nThank you for this discussion. I think, everything is said. \n\nHave a nice day", "Okay, how do you believe these things stop kids from having sex? What stops them from doing it before curfew? How does knowing their location prevent them from having sex? With supervised time, it's a careful balance of not being overbearing. Your kid is a teenager and they deserve more freedoms, more personal time, privacy, etc. And all that ensures is that they don't have sex during that specific time. There are so many hours in a day. \n\nTelling your child, \"no you cannot have sex\" and then trying to monitor them all the time is not healthy. \n\nEncouraging them to be safe and allowing them the opportunity to open up to you with any problems is far better for kids.", ">Telling your child, \"no you cannot have sex\" and then trying to monitor them all the time is not healthy.\n\nOf course not, and I'm not arguing for that. I'm just uneasy with this notion that a 13 year old is fully equipped and should be encouraged to explore their sexuality, just giving them birth control and hoping they be safe. \n\nJust because a practice in the name of safety doesn't fully guarantee protection doesn't mean it's worthless. Things like curfews, location tracking, etc can help mitigate risk, not prevent it. \n\nAs you said, it's a careful balance. You don't want to be overbearing, but you also need to make sure you're not giving too much freedom too quickly. Both can be bad, and a lot of times it's on an individual basis, as every kid is different!", ">I'm just uneasy with this notion that a 13 year old is fully equipped and should be encouraged to explore their sexuality, just giving them birth control and hoping they be safe.\n\nCan I ask why? It's a normal part of life. 13 is an age full of exploration for so many people. I don't think you should be telling your kid, \"yes! Have sex! Have all the sex right now.\" But you should be acknowledging kids are going to be curious about sex, kids are going to have sex. \n\nIt's your job as a parent to make sure they can do that in the safest way possible while making yourself as open to your child as possible.", ">Can I ask why?\n\nYeah for sure. To be quite frank, I grew up in a pretty religious atmosphere, the \"no sex until marriage\" kind of vibe. As an adult, I no longer ascribe to that belief and certainly have no problem with a healthy and active sexual life, consenting adults doing their own thing and whatnot, but I can't deny that my upbringing has probably influenced my beliefs still.\n\nAll that said, I still really feel like 13 is too young to be exploring that kind of thing to the point of needing condoms. A lot of adults are not good or responsible about sex despite being well-educated on it, much less a 13 year old. While I'd of course much rather someone of that age, if they're going to have sex, have access to birth control and education, I don't think also taking steps as a parent to try and prevent that situation from needlessly occurring is a bad thing either."]}
