Yes you are responsible for your tab but the owner/manager NEEDS to know what a jackass they hired. That's what I would be mentioning next time you go.", "I actually disagree with a lot of commenters. I think you walking out was probably the BEST outcome. I mean, imagine the economic damage that could have been done had you simply shared this interaction on Facebook...it'd be more than $25, that is for sure.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You spend enough money there and bring in customers. Does she still work there? EDIT I stutter too at times and when I start I stop trying to talk and I whistle and that usually helps we stop stuttering .", "Look I\u2019m going to get down voted, but I\u2019m assuming if this is real you may want a range of perspectives, so here I go. \n\nWas she wrong, yep! \n\nBut the way you handled her poor behaviour with the \u201cI come here every week and I don\u2019t deserve this. Fuck you\u201d was always going to net a bad response. Not paying the tab was always going to reinforce that. There was going to be consequences. It\u2019s kind of like in office conflict. Someone does something wrong, another employee responds in an inappropriate way, they are both in discussions with HR. The discussions are just different, but there are discussions nonetheless. \n\nThere is a good chance that the bar manager did talk to her about what happened if only because it was so widely noticed with the \u201cwhite knighting\u201d. She may well have told the truth, and that she apologised. She may well have been told to get her act together and been told you were a long term customer.  She may have been told if anything like that happens again then she is out of a job. \n\nJust as the bar manager spoke to you to tell you to pay your bar tab. Im somewhat surprised you were not told to not swear at staff.  \n\nI\u2019m guessing you would have appreciated the opportunity to tell the story from the beginning, but as you had already received an apology the bar manager might not have seen the point and might have felt it wise to not poke the bear, but that\u2019s just a wild guess. He also might have thought that as you didn\u2019t actually raise a formal complaint then he would respect your decision to not discuss it further. \n\nAnyway, there is another perspective for you. \n\nESH -  Does it suck, yep. Sorry that happened.", "NTA! Fellow person with a speech impediment here: One of the things I absolutely cannot tolerate is when people intentionally make fun of my speech. That bartender has absolutely no business laughing at a customer, even if she *might* have thought you were drunk (as other customers suggested). Definitely talk to the manager about what she did.\n\nI do feel like it is up to you to pay the tab, but given the circumstances at the time and the low amount of money, it really wasn't worth it to anyone for you to stick around, especially when that meant more potential arguments. At a bar. Where drunk people are.", "NTA. She was rude and ableist and shouldn't be working with the public with an attitude like that. \n\nI think you should have complained about her to the manager that night or soon after. They could have then asked you about the tab. \n\nI still think you should complain about her and explain your side of the story. Send an email if it's easier, or complain online if they actively respond to reviews.", "NAH From your perspective as a person with a stutter, I understand getting frustrated and upset that someone treated you that way. As a general rule, society can be pretty cruel to people who are different. It's often a slow trickle of lots of little cuts over time, but in the end it can become a flood. Many issues get easier to handle over time, but issues related to feelings around disability or ND often don't. They can get harder because it's just people going in for the same cuts over and over, or you keep having to fight the battles over and over again while everyone else just makes your life harder and blames you for it. It's not surprising that on occasion you'll overact and lash out at people who push your buttons. Unfortunately, while that reaction is understandable, you'll likely be the one paying for it in the end.\n\nAs for the bartender, I can't exactly call her an asshole, either. She likely deals with a lot of drunks or people who are slurring their words. It was also probably loud, since most bars are. She didn't know you, and most  people's reaction when someone struggles with saying something in a bar would be to assume they've had one too many instead of them having a stutter or some other issue. She may also have assumed you were about to hit on her or propose a threesome and were nervous about getting the words out, hence the awkward laugh.\n\nYou're also kind of an asshole for leaving the bar on the hook for your tab for two months. I know it was unintentional and it seems like you just forgot, but that's a shitty thing to do to a business you like. Why did you stay away from a bar you like and frequently patronize for two months? I ask because I fear your experience with that one bartender may have clouded how you seen the entire place, and that's not great for you. Do not let the assholes (even the unintentional ones) take more than they've already taken from you.", "NTA. If it's really bothering you the way you handled it apologize to the employee next time you seem them. Just keep it simple. 'I'm sorry for swearing at you, I was having a tough week, and I shouldn't have said that.'\n\nJust let the open tab business go, of course they want their money.", "Nta", "NTA. This kinda seems like your spot and this person was rude and ruined it for you. People need to learn to just own up to their fuck-ups, apologize, then STFU. Making excuses just digs the hole deeper.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe AH move would have been to fling a beer bottle in her face. Getting angry at BS excuses is a human thing. People react differently on different days. You tried to handle it calmly. Excuses and whataboutisms make me furious too.", "I have a stutter. People laugh. The world doesn\u2019t exist to make me comfortable. She was a bad person, you acted similarly even after she apologized.\n\n\nESH", "If you Walk out on its tab. It's theft of goods so you could actually be arrested for this. So the people were probably upset by the way you spoke to her and then walking out on your tab. I understand she insulted you and people don't know the whole story but still you walked out on your tab", "Yta. Regardless of whether the bartender was laughing *at you*, you stiffed the tab. Regardless of circumstances you escalated a conflict, then didn't pay your bill, then complained that the bar expected to be paid.", "YTA. What the girl did wasn't right but what you did was just as bad. Because having a bad week is NO excuse to take your frustrations out on someone or to think you can skip out on a bill like that.", "[deleted]", "You are the asshole of course!

And if someone was that drunk, they shouldn\u2019t be served.", "I think it\u2019s unlikely.", "You said one of the managers knows you pretty well yeah? It might be worth reaching out to them and explaining that you're sorry for leaving the tab open for so long, thank them for not taking legal action about it (though to be honest, a $25 tab isn't worth chasing anyone over) and laying out that you'd had a bad week at work and their waitress making fun of your stutter was the straw that broke the camels back. Tell them you know it's not an excuse just an explanation, and that you know you didn't handle it well and apologize. Clear the air and everything.", "It kind of was intentional. She had already run my card and I wasn\u2019t going to go back up there and attempt another interaction after that.", "Fair enough but not all stutters sound the same at all and not all drunk people sound the same - and I\u2019ve been to a few bars that tend to happily serve drunk people. Apologies if I offended, wasn\u2019t my intention.", "You\u2019d certainly know better than me, so I\u2019d say ESH just for the not paying of the tab.", "That may be the best solution.

I was hoping she would have asked me about it.", "Adding on as someone with speech issues, (not to be rude, just to inform) I think it's... really rare at BEST for drunk people to sound like people with speech issues. Inebriation has a lot of outward signs that speech-exclusive issues don't (i.e lack of coordination, actual slurring rather than stuttering, etc)", "Fair. I just wanted to get out there. If there had been someone else working I would have."]}
