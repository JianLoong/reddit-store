From that moment on my parents didn't give me money nor did I ever ask them to give me money. Now for background we are well off. My parents own 2 houses (1 we live in other one is rented out) and they both have income. I am a full time student and I'm trying to start my SMMA business. I have 8k savings and I lend my dad 2k 2 years ago. I asked my dad if he could repay me the 2k as that was our agreement so I could invest in my business. He said I should use my own money from my savings and that he would repay me later. I asked my sister (20F) if she could repay me the 250 that I gave her 3 months ago (when I gave her the money she said she would repay me after 1 week). She said she didn't have the money. Now the reason I don't want to use my saving is because I just turned 18 and have to pay health insurance. I want to pay the whole year at once so I won't have to worry about it later. I take driving lessons and I have to pay that next week. I have to pay school tuition in 5 weeks. This all combined is gonna cost me 4k at least and on top of that I have other costs as well. I pay everything myself and I have been saving this money since I was a little kid from my allowance (20 bucks a month) and I still save till this day. I also want to buy a car and with that I have to pay car insurance as well and I have to pay it myself. My sister on the other hand has been unemployed for months and my mom gives her 250 bucks a month and my dad pays her school supplies and fees on top of it my dad got her a car (3000 bucks) and he pays her car insurance .\n\nI asked my mom this time and she said she didn't have any money. Now my moms income isn't the highest but I only asked for 200 bucks and she said no. I told my parents that they always have money to give my sister but not me? My parents said that I am capable of taking care of myself and I shouldn't ask for money when I clearly don't need it. I got mad and said that I did need the money because turning 18 wasn't cheap and they should know as they helped my sister pay all of her stuff and besides I didn't ask for any money that wasn't mine from my dad and sister. I also said that they always favor my sister when it's about money. I told them that they didn't even ask me once if I needed money when I was using my savings because of my internship that didn't even pay me enough to cover my travel expenses. And that next year I would have to use my own savings again as they aren't gonna help me out anyways. My dad got mad and said that the 2k was his and that I was able to save it because he gave me allowance he said that he was providing a roof over my head and food, water. He said I should be grateful because I now live in a bigger house and room then before we moved and threatened to kick me out if I ever acted ungrateful again. I honestly don't know if I'm being ungrateful or unreasonable. My mom said I'm TA for talking back and saying all this.

Stay in their home as long as they don't charge you for food/rent. You will still be able to save more money to better prepare you for when you have to leave. Try to keep a first and last months rent in savings so you have a starting point if you need to leave quickly.\n\nI'm curious about the health insurance. In the US, parents can keep their children on their health insurance until 26 as long as they are a dependent/in school. Are they charging you for keeping you on, or are you paying for your own/ live in another country with other rules?\n\nMove your money to an account in a different bank that your parents have no access to. I agree, you will never see that 2k again, or the 250. Write it off as a family loss and Never loan them money again.\n\nBut I totally agree parents are disgraceful, you must be the scapegoat to counter your sister the golden child. Parents are responsible for those basic things until they come of age. To throw that in your face *is* despicable. NTA", "Yeah, whenever they say they need money then just say \"I don't have it.\" That's what they say - and so they should understand it. Earmarked money for the future is in use and not for lending.", "Start storing food from the kitchen in her room, leave every electric item on 24/7.", "I strongly suggest you do so or at least threaten to. You need to establish boundaries if you are going to have a healthy relationship with them and he needs to be reminded that when he needed it you helped him out before his snapping there was extremely out of line and likely the result of ego. He needs a reality check and that would be exactly the thing to do it. I know it's hard but if they really love you then it will make them realize they are being unreasonable and if they don't well... They deserve it and it's better you know now then later. Family isn't a universal forgiveness pass and it's extremely important to stand up for yourself especially at this age where you are setting the terms for what your relationship will be like with them as an adult. It really sounds like they take you for granted.", "Apologies -and kudos", "My dear, I had parents like this. I felt I had to love my family. But please - see the red flags. The other two siblings - can you contact them? It might be good to understand their experience and weigh it against your own. They've been treated horribly by your father - so there is a pattern here. You're still young and under their roof and influence and that can make you want them and love them. But they are not healthy people. Your siblings are proof. So you have to mortgage your future and give away hard earned/saved money so you don't lose a relationship with them? That's not unconditional love. I hope at some point you can see that and find people in your life that do love and support you unconditionally.", "I'm just wondering how people can go through life like this and not realize that these people don't care about them and only keep them around for what they can take from them. YOUR PARENTS JUST WANT YOUR MONEY. THEY DONT LOVE YOU. Family isn't just family because of DNA. They have to say and do things that show they care and want to help. But they can't even say a nice word to you. You need to leave and cut contact. I'm serious. Family isn't worth your life or sanity when they haven't done anything to deserve it or even worse have done things to deserve hatred."]}
