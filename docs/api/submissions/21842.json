From that moment on my parents didn't give me money nor did I ever ask them to give me money. Now for background we are well off. My parents own 2 houses (1 we live in other one is rented out) and they both have income. I am a full time student and I'm trying to start my SMMA business. I have 8k savings and I lend my dad 2k 2 years ago. I asked my dad if he could repay me the 2k as that was our agreement so I could invest in my business. He said I should use my own money from my savings and that he would repay me later. I asked my sister (20F) if she could repay me the 250 that I gave her 3 months ago (when I gave her the money she said she would repay me after 1 week). She said she didn't have the money. Now the reason I don't want to use my saving is because I just turned 18 and have to pay health insurance. I want to pay the whole year at once so I won't have to worry about it later. I take driving lessons and I have to pay that next week. I have to pay school tuition in 5 weeks. This all combined is gonna cost me 4k at least and on top of that I have other costs as well. I pay everything myself and I have been saving this money since I was a little kid from my allowance (20 bucks a month) and I still save till this day. I also want to buy a car and with that I have to pay car insurance as well and I have to pay it myself. My sister on the other hand has been unemployed for months and my mom gives her 250 bucks a month and my dad pays her school supplies and fees on top of it my dad got her a car (3000 bucks) and he pays her car insurance .\n\nI asked my mom this time and she said she didn't have any money. Now my moms income isn't the highest but I only asked for 200 bucks and she said no. I told my parents that they always have money to give my sister but not me? My parents said that I am capable of taking care of myself and I shouldn't ask for money when I clearly don't need it. I got mad and said that I did need the money because turning 18 wasn't cheap and they should know as they helped my sister pay all of her stuff and besides I didn't ask for any money that wasn't mine from my dad and sister. I also said that they always favor my sister when it's about money. I told them that they didn't even ask me once if I needed money when I was using my savings because of my internship that didn't even pay me enough to cover my travel expenses. And that next year I would have to use my own savings again as they aren't gonna help me out anyways. My dad got mad and said that the 2k was his and that I was able to save it because he gave me allowance he said that he was providing a roof over my head and food, water. He said I should be grateful because I now live in a bigger house and room then before we moved and threatened to kick me out if I ever acted ungrateful again. I honestly don't know if I'm being ungrateful or unreasonable. My mom said I'm TA for talking back and saying all this.

I DESPISE when parents say things like food water and a roof, because thats not debt, thats bare minimum a parent should be doing for their child. To use that against you is such a cop out.\n\nImo op, I think when you have the chance, might be good to jump ship, move out if youre able and flat share with people. When your parents ask why, just let them know you dont feel at home anymore.\n\nThe fact that your dad is just keeping 2k is diagraceful and he should be ashamed as a father", "NTA and you should get out of there fast. If they use kicking you out as their final argument every time they disagree with you to blackmail you into submission you will be miserable in no time. I know that it is expensive, but you have to find a way for your own mental health.\n\nAfter that you can set a deadline for your father to pay or you can go the legal route (as long as you have proof, for example text messages where he states that he will pay the 2k back).", "NTA\n\nbut you are in a financial abusive relationship with your family that won't improve.

It sounds like your parents are bad at handling money, and have never honestly shared their situation. Your dad basically threatened to kick you out over 2 grand - That's not a healthy way to parent, or something a well off parent would do.\n\nMore relevantly, it sounds like you are bad at handling money. If your business is to the point that hiring an employee would help you to meet demand, I would seriously rethink college.

You should still be on your parents healthcare majority do that for their kids unless they land a job that has a much better plan. Unless you end up well off before 26\n\nYour dad is wrong and that 2k he should have never gotten from you. Sucks to be in that situation where you should get that back but most likely won\u2019t. \n\nDon\u2019t think they\u2019re well off.. they may be good, but well off folks wouldn\u2019t be bickering with you about 200-400 bucks. They also typically can afford a car of some sort so an 18yo isn\u2019t trying to by a shit used one or an inflated and high interest new car. \n\nSucks your older sister is lazy and they support that more than helping you out because you do more for yourself. Not sure how they don\u2019t see that is unfair unless you\u2019re being taken care of financially other ways not explained on here.", "holy shit! your parents are so fucking out of line. you are totally NTA and you should never \"loan\" them money again. If you give them anything, consider it a gift and you will not see it again. Also beware for your future with them because they now see you as a money supply area. They will leach off of you for as long as you allow it. Stand up for yourself and cut those losers off.", "NTA\n\nYour parents (dad especially) are bullies. Forget about the money you gave them, they most likely never intended to pay you back or expected you to ask for it and be insistent. Never loan them money from this point onwards.", "Ask your school if you can defer school payments for this year (essentially take a gap year), as you are paying your own tuition in addition to extra living expenses.", "Nta", "Move out. Your family are leeches. They won't ever pay you back they'll just twist it around on you (again). They realized they have a high functioning daughter and a low functioning parasite and decided to let the high functioning one supplement their bullshit. If you got enough money to own 2 houses there's no reason you should be borrowing anything from your teenaged daughter. That shits weird. Mofo took a parent tax lmao", "NTA, your parents are LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE for your roof over your head and food in your stomach, it's a mind game that mental manipulators use to make you feel bad for something they're legally required to do. sure now that you're 18 they could kick you out, but that argument your parents made was for before you were 18 and before 18, legally they had the parental responsibilities that came along with raising kids. my mum did the same thing to me when i'd ask about compensation for jobs that, in all reality, were professional jobs but she didn't want to hire anyone out for when she had two strapping young boys to do it for free. Kitchen gets remodeled? i'm fully expected to help the demo that WAS hired and i'm there working because \"i live in this house.\" which yes, i did, but if you're going to hire professionals, at least pay me SOMETHING or else i'm not obligating myself to do the work and volun-telling me i have to work is going fall on deaf ears.", "NTA", "NTA, but I suspect your parents aren't as well of as you think and may be living beyond their means between the two houses and supporting you leech of a sister. There is no reason for a parent who is well off in a two income household to be borrowing 2k from their minor daughter then refusing to give it back. \n\n\nI think you need to consider the money a write off though, you aren't going to get it back from your parents or your sister.  Don't lend them any money in the future.", "NTA\n\nDo not loan money to family ever again. They are obviously never going to pay it back. \n\nYour father is wrong. Your mom is not supportive. \n\nI\u2019d work towards moving out and reducing contact.", "I have a bank transaction where he paid 250 and he noted that there was 2k remaining. I don't want to go the legal route for 2k because they are no matter what my family. I just wish they helped me out a little more.", "Yep. Parents are broke and living way above their means.", "It is your right to not persue it, but I don't think that your parents will change considering everything you've written about them in your post. I don't think you will get your money later if you don't pressure them into it some way as they would have paid it back already otherwise.", "Look op, it really depends, not saying that you need to cut contact, but often these situations dont get better until they get the message. If youre able to move out, then you should and just not say anything. When they try and get in touch with you, just say \"im sick of being threatened to get kicked out any time I ask for help, so I just went by myself, hope that makes you happy\" and see their reaction. If they are actually good loving parents, then they are going to panic and feel bad", "If they do not acknowledge their favoritism, they will never help you....but they'll come to you to get some help later coz your sister won't give a penny!!!\nAnd you have prooved that you are very capable without their help\nSo my ptv: leave them (best moment will be if/when they threaten you to kick you out: say ok!)

The last year it got better and my parents are paying off the house debt and our garden isn't done yet.

I have 2 half sibling who are from my dads previous marriage. My brother visits a few times a year and my half sister well uhm haven't seen her in 6 years. They got in a fight with dad when she visited and dad kicked her out. She never came back after and cut contact with all of us. I don't want to lose all my contact with my parents because I do love them no matter what. And the 2k. I'm not even after the money but I just want them to help me out a little because starting a business and turning 18 is expensive.", "But they are still supporting your sister with money whenever she wants something? I understand helping her with the essentials but it sounded like they help to fund her life even besides that. I don't know enough about your situation but favoritism seems likely from all you have told us", "you may not be after the money... but THEY are. you really need to see this and then you might not want to come back. they see you as a supply of money now. your half siblings likely got smart to what was going on and did themselves a favor and got outta dodge. I would imagine that your parents do not have as much money as they want you to believe they do... yikes, get out!", "Best of luck op, I havent been in a situation like this so I dont think im really in any place to give advice, I could very easily tell you the wrong thing by mistake. Doesnt sound like a very loving person though", "They got her a car and my mom gives her 250 a month. They pay her car insurance and they pay all of her school supplies. At my school I pay around 500 bucks for supplies and 1300 bucks yearly for school fee. I pay that myself so 1800 bucks myself when my parents pay it for her.", "I don't know how feasible it is for you to move out, but I would suggest it if at all possible as I don't see that behaviour changing. Your father has stated in no unclear words that you won't be able to complain about anything without him threatening to kick you out while they supply your sister with everything she could ever need. \n\nI guess I'm a little petty, but I would try to provoke that kind of talk when relatives are over and watch how that would go down as soon as I had my own place."]}
