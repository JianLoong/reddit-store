Growing up we weren't super close because he always considered me a half sibling versus a \"real\" sibling but as he got older our relationship did get better. We spoke on the phone probably once every 6 months for 3+ hours. However, we only saw each other maybe once every couple years. In between both of us working and me having a family of my own, time never seemed to line up. With that said though, my kids saw him a lot more than I did. Whenever my mom asked to take my kids for an overnight visit, she would generally end up seeing Joe so my kids were around him a lot more frequently than I have been and always loved him to death. But two years ago everything went sideways.\n\nHe ends up seeing a girl named Jenna. He called and told me about her when they had been hanging out for roughly 3 months and vented to me about not knowing what to do because Jenna was moving far too quickly, despite my brother trying to put the brakes on things (talking about marriage and babies and moving in together, etc). He was overwhelmed because he didn't know if he felt that deeply for her yet. But after that, he went complete NC with me. Wouldn't return my calls and left my messages on read. He stopped hanging out with our mother and siblings. Kept telling my mom he was too busy. My mom started getting super concerned because it was unlike him to not speak to or see her. Not too long afterwards, we find out Jenna is 4 months pregnant. She went off BC without telling my brother and tampered with the protection. She fully admitted to it. Waited to tell my brother until she was past the mark of being able to get an abortion, from what he told our mom. He didn't want anything to do with it but he would never abandon his child so he did the right thing and stuck it out. But he was miserable and wouldn't talk to anyone, outside of calling my mom crying a few times. But, at this point, he still wont talk to me and my kids had not seen him in 2 years either. My youngest doesn't even remember who he is.\n\nWell, he just had his baby recently and he didn't tell me until days afterwards. He sent pictures. She is beautiful; looks just like he did as a baby. He is in full daddy mode from the sounds of it. He asked me yesterday why I wasn't acting as happy for him as I did when I found out our sister was pregnant and why I hadn't asked to see his baby yet because I was there with our sister as soon as she had my niece. I was honest with him and told him it was because we hardly knew him anymore, whereas our sister kept in full contact and we saw each other often. She wanted me there, he didn't. He wouldn't even return my calls or texts. I told him I was happy for him but the situation was different. He says I am insensitive as hell and I should have tried harder.

He is angry about where he is and can't express it in a healthy way. So he lashes out at you to release some of that frustration. It's not healthy, nor good for your relationship.  You could try to confront him on the facts but because he is trapped in a bad relationship with his baby momma he isn't happy with and  a daughter he adores. He's too close to see the problems. All you can do is try to make him see his situation, which is tough. But he was lied to and manipulated into his current situation and may not know what to do. It's a shitty situation regardless.", "NTA..he's the one who ignored your calls and texts and avoided seeing your mom and kids. What exactly did he think was going to happen when he continue disregarded you? Obviously you're happy for him but it's hard to get super excited because if it were me id be waiting for him to go nc again.", "NTA - I mean, it is a tough situation but I get it. I understand his feelings being hurt but you are right, it\u2019s not the same. \n\nMy situation isn\u2019t this bad, but my sisters daughter (age 6) is my first niece and my bf and my god daughter. I love her to bits and we go to all her soccer games, we chat on the  phone, we hang out, ect. My sister and I are also VERY CLOSE and my sister and her husband have a great relationship with my bf. \n\nHowever the neice and nephew on my bfs side\u2026. We are both not as close with. My bf is pretty much estranged from his siblings. They can be jealous all they want that their kids aren\u2019t special to us\u2026but you get what you give. Just because you have a child doesn\u2019t mean they automatically have to be a big part in other ppls life. His brothers are shitty ppl to him. They aren\u2019t close. Why would we be close with their 2 yr old and 1 year old?", "Funny how you should try harder, but his complete lack of engagement is perfectly fine.  Someone has memory problems, and it's not OP. All OP did was state the facts.  The brother didn't like reality and would prefer some alternate facts.  NTA", "NTA. You appear to have attempted to reach out somewhat. Could you have done more? Maybe. But he didn't respond to any of your calls or messages. Could he have done more? Probably. If he hadn't gone low-contact to no-contact with you, I'd say no assholes here, but that's not the case.\n\nIt sounds from this post as if your brother is in a complicated space. One of the problems here is that you don't see him more often than a couple of years. I understand lives and families and such. But if you set a goal of seeing someone, then you see someone. No 'fault' being assigned here to one of you; you both failed to nurture your relationship. \n\nWhat do \\_you\\_ want out of this relationship? If it's something closer, then you need to take action to open that door. Then it's up to him to step through (while acknowledging that parenting a new baby is a consuming thing even if there's none of the drama you believe happened).", "You can try harder to talk to a brick wall, but it\u2019s not going to respond. \n\nNTA", "NAH but you two need to work on how you communicate. He\u2019s going through a difficult time so if you can try to be more supportive and understanding it might help him to open up to you more and repair things", "NAH.  Not unusual human drama/family dynamics & people don't always agree.  You arexan adult choosing who to put energy into contact with and how much.  Other adults are free to disagree with your choices.", "This timeline doesn\u2019t make sense. Babies only gestate for 9 months, how has he not seen family for 2 years? That predates his relationship with this woman based on the info in the post", "I guess I'm confused on how you could lose the bond with your brother in only 2 years? I have 3 and one is far away from us and had alcohol issues. He would also leave us on read or not return or calls and texts. I didn't see him for over 4 years but when he wanted or needed me I was there like no time went by and I didn't give him grief over his absence. He got clean and is in contact again with everyone. \n\nIt sounds like your brother was dealing with his life choices and he wasn't happy. He could've been dealing with depression and checked out for a little bit. Wouldn't this be a great time to reestablish your bond? I'm going with ESH. He was a major AH for telling you to try harder!!! As a sis, I would've blown up on that one. I hope things work out for you and your brother OP.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kept telling my mom he was too busy. My mom started getting super concerned because it was unlike him to not speak to or see her. Not too long afterwards, we find out Jenna is 4 months pregnant.\n\nThere are months between these events. As I stated in my comment to you. After going NC with me he still kept in basic contact with my mother for at least 6 months, though it was infrequent and no in person visits. The last time he told my mother he was too busy to see her, which was probably a good year and a couple months after the last time I spoke to him is when my mom was told that he was having a baby. The time line does add up and I have no idea why you are so concerned with that aspect of this post instead of just answering the question."]}
