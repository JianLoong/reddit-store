She's using her coworkers as a free, private taxi service, and that's not okay.\n\nIf she prefers to take public transportation or a ride share company, why is she asking her new coworkers to go out of their way to drive her home? \n\nYou are under no obligation to give a coworker a ride home, especially if it's not on your way home.

You don\u2019t owe anyone anything after you clock out", "Nta.  She took the job knowing what it was.  You should not have to add an extra 30 minutes to your day to fix her problem.", "NTA. Since her not driving is a permanent situation right now, that means she'll expect everyone else to step in constantly for transportation. This is unrealistic, especially being 30 minutes out of your way.  \n\nShe's also not chipping in for gas or vehicle maintenance. Someone on \"the team\" who was critical of you can step in to assume care for this person's transit.", "NTA, it's not on you to provide her transportation.  She may be a lovely person, but bumming rides last minute and taking someone 30 min out of their way is not considerate.", "NTA lol\n\nTell the team to STFU or drive her around themselves. What an insane comment from them. Don't let that shit fly.\n\nThis person sounds like a total chancer. Who on Earth takes a job that requires loads of travel if they don't drive? I personally don't drive, so I acknowledge there are jobs I simply won't even apply for because I can't get there. Not coworker's problem, not employer's problem, it's my problem and no one else's.\n\nHer commute is her own responsibility, if she's unable to organise it or can't pay for all the Ubers and stuff, she's welcome to look for a new job.", "NTA.

There's no need to involve others. Your co-workers could tell her no as well if they don't want to burden her transportation needs. She will be fine.", "NTA- You're not required to give anyone a ride home. If anything the coworkers who are bugging you need to step up and take her home then.", "NTA. It was her choice to take that job and your choice not to be a built-in Uber driver", "NTA. And I say this as a non-driver.\nIf you don't drive, you can't just expect a ride, let alone one that's out of the driver's way after a very long shift.\nNot driving requires more planning ahead. It means getting familiar with bus routes and paying for a cab or uber now and then. It can mean finding people willing to carpool and sharing the cost of gas. But it's not ok to constantly bum free rides off of folks.", "NTA. You aren't her Uber and your team doesn't want to get stuck driving her.\n\nContinue to say no. Your time is not her time.\n\nI have a colleague who doesn't drive and complains about the cost of Uber so mostly works remotely.

There is no way I would add 30 minutes of travel to a long work day.  She took the job and she knew her transportation limitations.  This is not on you.  Unfair and rude?
