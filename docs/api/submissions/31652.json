My dad has always been the cool understanding dad. He always have letted me wear or do whatever I want. In high school he was ok with bringing my boyfriend around and helped if I asked for safety stuff or anything like this.\n\nWe have a pool at our home and I always wore revealing bikinis and danced or whatever and my family being my family didn\u2019t mind or see anything wrong.\n\nAs I said my dad has always been cool with anything, but he always told me if I\u2019m not in a place or time or age that is appropriate to wear something I should respect that ( the age thing was for when I was younger ). You can see how much he respects others as well.\n\nMonths ago I was in a pool party with my friends and pumped into my cousin who was cool with everything he witnessed. Which made me believe that he\u2019ll be ok with me doing anything in the trip I mentioned.\n\nWhen the trip came I packed what\u2019s usual for me and wore it. Nothing seemed wrong we were all having fun and being ourselves but then I noticed my father being pissed a little. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nAfter a while my aunt approached me. She started talking about how my behaviors and wearables aren\u2019t appropriate. Saying that I should respect myself and my family and not do what I\u2019m doing. And then said she hopes I\u2019m not doing this in front of my friends as well because that would make me an S.\n\nShe continued by saying that she noticed these stuff when I was younger but didn\u2019t say anything out of respect to my father and it didn\u2019t effect her but now she doesn\u2019t want it to affect her son.\n\nI was a little pissed as well but I just busted out laughing at her. She seemed confused then I told her that first it\u2019s non of her business. I know my family is comfortable and happy with what I\u2019m doing and me being myself. Then told her how my father when I was younger guided me on how to wear but was always respectful and I understood him when I grew up so if there\u2019s anything she noticed when I was little it\u2019s her small mind that isn\u2019t comfortable to it. As for me being an S it really made my blood boil to come from her but decided to not tell her anything about it. And just ended by asking her why would her son not be comfortable with me wearing revealing bikinis and dancing here and not in a pool party? She seemed confused again and I just went out. \n\nI sat down and told my brother and he laughed and told me I did the right thing, and told me as a male from my family he\u2019s not ashamed or uncomfortable with anything I do. \n\nMy dad came and talked to me and before he started I told him she talked to me. He then asked me to change my altitude and clothes just this time and I told him I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin my family trip for her. My cousin didn\u2019t talk to me so I don\u2019t know about him at all.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700851765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182z1b4/aita_for_wearing_a_bikini_in_my_family_trip/", "score": 1785, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it just a regular bikini and she\u2019s just very conservative? \n\nIs it an extremely skimpy bikini that\u2019s literally like a g-sting/thong? The type you see \u201cinstagram models\u201d wear? Mind finding a link to a similar bikini so we have a better idea?\n\nAlso what type of dancing are you talking about? Because you could just be doing simple little silly dances OR are you like twerking? If you were twerking were you wearing a thong like bikini?\n\nHow old is your cousin?\n\nWere you dancing up on other people as well? Just trying to understand because the way you write it, it really could be that she overreacted way too much OR with some of the words you\u2019re using like \u201crevealing clothes/bikinis\u201d and \u201cdancing\u201d.. depending on what you actually did, it could be seen as inappropriate and disrespectful to others. \n\nEven if your immediate family doesn\u2019t mind, if you were are wearing thongs and twerking (not saying you was, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for further clarification) while trying to enjoy a family trip.. I can kind of see how that\u2019d be uncomfortable for her. She should not have slut shamed you though.\n\nETA- Also how would you not wearing revealing bikinis ruin your trip? Just curious because even if she is over reacting, putting on a shirt or a bikini that\u2019s less revealing isn\u2019t going to ruin your trip? It seems like the best compromise tbh. You say your dad is a really cool guy and always respected you and others. \n\nIf he\u2019s such a good dad and has always been very open with you, I feel it\u2019s only fair this one time you suck it up and put some more clothes on. Don\u2019t do it for aunt or cousin but do it for dad. He\u2019s never asked you to dressed differently, but he wants to enjoy the trip just as much as you do, and when the only 2 options are you keeping on doing what you\u2019re doing and causing your dad to be miserable because of the aunt, OR You just putting shorts on over your bottoms or a shirt, I think the choice is an easy one. \n\nIf you don\u2019t change, it WILL ruin your dads trip (the dad who\u2019s very kind and respectful to you) BUT I do not see how you putting on more clothes could possibly ruin your trip? Give your dad the respect he\u2019s always given you, and considering this is the FIRST time he asked this of you so his trip isn\u2019t ruined, you can put on more clothes.", "idk what you were wearing or how you were dancing, but the fact that your dad is always on your side and still told you to tone it down a bit gives me pause. so...tentative YTA", "This subreddit seems to be frequented predominantly by North Americans (USA/Canada).  On the spectrum of liberal to conservative views on women's clothing, comfort with nudity, and comfort with the human body in general, North Americans lean to the conservative side (but are for more liberal than a lot of places).  That said, if you are in a very progressive place in this respect, you're going to get a much different perspective here.\n\nPersonally, I think people's discomfort/fear of the human body, and the immediate assumption that it is sexual, is problematic and misguided.  That said, I also think it is important for us to be mindful of how we are impacting the people around us.  I don't think Y T A for dressing how you're comfortable, but there may be negative consequences for disregarding the discomfort of your family members (e.g., they may want to spend less time with you).  You need to ask yourself: does the benefit of dressing how you want outweigh the benefit of spending time with people you care about?  Is wearing your bikini more important than your family members feeling uncomfortable and awkward around you?\n\nI say NAH because you are entirely within your right to wear whatever you like.

I didn\u2019t realise how revealing what I was wearing in her company really was and I took it on board. She wasn\u2019t shaming me at all and I still dressed how I like when he wasn\u2019t around. Just some people are more conservative than others and since I liked him I chose to cover up to avoid fighting over something stupid like my right to wear booty shorts.", "NTA.  Your aunt needs to speak to your cousin, to educate him that just because a woman chooses a certain way does not mean she is doing it for anyone but herself and still deserves respect as a human.", "NTA. If the family don't like it, they can point their eyes somewhere else.", "\"As I said my dad has always been cool with anything, but he always told me if I\u2019m not in a place or time or age that is appropriate to wear something I should respect that\"\n\nNTA. Well, you're in another country that may or may not be more conservative than your home country, but that does not appear to be the issue.\n\nWhile you are with family that is more conservative, you are IMO correct to assume equal footing with her.

I do not believe the aunt has any authority to slut-shame someone for wearing a revealing swimsuit around a same age opposite sex cousin. The thong? Yuck, but the aunt went completely overboard. Fundamentally, the aunt and the OP are equally guests. I disagree with the posters who say the op should not wear revealing swimwear around non-residing family on the grounds that there is no tiebreaker for why the aunt should not leave the beach if the OP wants to enjoy it her way.", "NTA.

People are literally saying that she can wear whatever she want and a thong/string bikini is perfectly fine when she\u2019s out with friends or whatever. It\u2019s just about it being a family setting that makes it inappropriate. \n\nLike someone said, people understand you wouldn\u2019t wear that in front of your boss and colleagues.
