My dad has always been the cool understanding dad. He always have letted me wear or do whatever I want. In high school he was ok with bringing my boyfriend around and helped if I asked for safety stuff or anything like this.\n\nWe have a pool at our home and I always wore revealing bikinis and danced or whatever and my family being my family didn\u2019t mind or see anything wrong.\n\nAs I said my dad has always been cool with anything, but he always told me if I\u2019m not in a place or time or age that is appropriate to wear something I should respect that ( the age thing was for when I was younger ). You can see how much he respects others as well.\n\nMonths ago I was in a pool party with my friends and pumped into my cousin who was cool with everything he witnessed. Which made me believe that he\u2019ll be ok with me doing anything in the trip I mentioned.\n\nWhen the trip came I packed what\u2019s usual for me and wore it. Nothing seemed wrong we were all having fun and being ourselves but then I noticed my father being pissed a little. I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nAfter a while my aunt approached me. She started talking about how my behaviors and wearables aren\u2019t appropriate. Saying that I should respect myself and my family and not do what I\u2019m doing. And then said she hopes I\u2019m not doing this in front of my friends as well because that would make me an S.\n\nShe continued by saying that she noticed these stuff when I was younger but didn\u2019t say anything out of respect to my father and it didn\u2019t effect her but now she doesn\u2019t want it to affect her son.\n\nI was a little pissed as well but I just busted out laughing at her. She seemed confused then I told her that first it\u2019s non of her business. I know my family is comfortable and happy with what I\u2019m doing and me being myself. Then told her how my father when I was younger guided me on how to wear but was always respectful and I understood him when I grew up so if there\u2019s anything she noticed when I was little it\u2019s her small mind that isn\u2019t comfortable to it. As for me being an S it really made my blood boil to come from her but decided to not tell her anything about it. And just ended by asking her why would her son not be comfortable with me wearing revealing bikinis and dancing here and not in a pool party? She seemed confused again and I just went out. \n\nI sat down and told my brother and he laughed and told me I did the right thing, and told me as a male from my family he\u2019s not ashamed or uncomfortable with anything I do. \n\nMy dad came and talked to me and before he started I told him she talked to me. He then asked me to change my altitude and clothes just this time and I told him I don\u2019t know if I want to ruin my family trip for her. My cousin didn\u2019t talk to me so I don\u2019t know about him at all.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1700851765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182z1b4/aita_for_wearing_a_bikini_in_my_family_trip/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it just a regular bikini and she\u2019s just very conservative? \n\nIs it an extremely skimpy bikini that\u2019s literally like a g-sting/thong? The type you see \u201cinstagram models\u201d wear? Mind finding a link to a similar bikini so we have a better idea?\n\nAlso what type of dancing are you talking about? Because you could just be doing simple little silly dances OR are you like twerking? If you were twerking were you wearing a thong like bikini?\n\nHow old is your cousin?\n\nWere you dancing up on other people as well? Just trying to understand because the way you write it, it really could be that she overreacted way too much OR with some of the words you\u2019re using like \u201crevealing clothes/bikinis\u201d and \u201cdancing\u201d.. depending on what you actually did, it could be seen as inappropriate and disrespectful to others. \n\nEven if your immediate family doesn\u2019t mind, if you were are wearing thongs and twerking (not saying you was, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for further clarification) while trying to enjoy a family trip.. I can kind of see how that\u2019d be uncomfortable for her. She should not have slut shamed you though.\n\nETA- Also how would you not wearing revealing bikinis ruin your trip? Just curious because even if she is over reacting, putting on a shirt or a bikini that\u2019s less revealing isn\u2019t going to ruin your trip? It seems like the best compromise tbh. You say your dad is a really cool guy and always respected you and others. \n\nIf he\u2019s such a good dad and has always been very open with you, I feel it\u2019s only fair this one time you suck it up and put some more clothes on. Don\u2019t do it for aunt or cousin but do it for dad. He\u2019s never asked you to dressed differently, but he wants to enjoy the trip just as much as you do, and when the only 2 options are you keeping on doing what you\u2019re doing and causing your dad to be miserable because of the aunt, OR You just putting shorts on over your bottoms or a shirt, I think the choice is an easy one. \n\nIf you don\u2019t change, it WILL ruin your dads trip (the dad who\u2019s very kind and respectful to you) BUT I do not see how you putting on more clothes could possibly ruin your trip? Give your dad the respect he\u2019s always given you, and considering this is the FIRST time he asked this of you so his trip isn\u2019t ruined, you can put on more clothes.", "idk what you were wearing or how you were dancing, but the fact that your dad is always on your side and still told you to tone it down a bit gives me pause. so...tentative YTA", "This subreddit seems to be frequented predominantly by North Americans (USA/Canada).  On the spectrum of liberal to conservative views on women's clothing, comfort with nudity, and comfort with the human body in general, North Americans lean to the conservative side (but are for more liberal than a lot of places).  That said, if you are in a very progressive place in this respect, you're going to get a much different perspective here.\n\nPersonally, I think people's discomfort/fear of the human body, and the immediate assumption that it is sexual, is problematic and misguided.  That said, I also think it is important for us to be mindful of how we are impacting the people around us.  I don't think Y T A for dressing how you're comfortable, but there may be negative consequences for disregarding the discomfort of your family members (e.g., they may want to spend less time with you).  You need to ask yourself: does the benefit of dressing how you want outweigh the benefit of spending time with people you care about?  Is wearing your bikini more important than your family members feeling uncomfortable and awkward around you?\n\nI say NAH because you are entirely within your right to wear whatever you like.

I didn\u2019t realise how revealing what I was wearing in her company really was and I took it on board. She wasn\u2019t shaming me at all and I still dressed how I like when he wasn\u2019t around. Just some people are more conservative than others and since I liked him I chose to cover up to avoid fighting over something stupid like my right to wear booty shorts.", "NTA.  Your aunt needs to speak to your cousin, to educate him that just because a woman chooses a certain way does not mean she is doing it for anyone but herself and still deserves respect as a human.", "NTA. If the family don't like it, they can point their eyes somewhere else.", "\"As I said my dad has always been cool with anything, but he always told me if I\u2019m not in a place or time or age that is appropriate to wear something I should respect that\"\n\nNTA. Well, you're in another country that may or may not be more conservative than your home country, but that does not appear to be the issue.\n\nWhile you are with family that is more conservative, you are IMO correct to assume equal footing with her.

I do not believe the aunt has any authority to slut-shame someone for wearing a revealing swimsuit around a same age opposite sex cousin. The thong? Yuck, but the aunt went completely overboard. Fundamentally, the aunt and the OP are equally guests. I disagree with the posters who say the op should not wear revealing swimwear around non-residing family on the grounds that there is no tiebreaker for why the aunt should not leave the beach if the OP wants to enjoy it her way.", "NTA.

People are literally saying that she can wear whatever she want and a thong/string bikini is perfectly fine when she\u2019s out with friends or whatever. It\u2019s just about it being a family setting that makes it inappropriate. \n\nLike someone said, people understand you wouldn\u2019t wear that in front of your boss and colleagues.

Or because he felt like he had to tell you something that shouldn't even need to be said at a certain point?\n\n>What I can say is my cousin isn\u2019t a little kid or a child\n\nSo, like.... 14? 15?\nThe reason I'm asking is to get a better idea of what your aunt might have been thinking, not to cast my own personal judgment.", "Look, I\u2019ve been slut shamed a lot, especially growing up, and especially as a teenager. But you\u2019re downplaying actual slut shaming by equating it with family members being uncomfortable with one of their other family members twerking around them in a thong bikini.\n\nSlut shaming = \u201cStop shaking your bare ass and acting like a little whore around all of us. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d \n\nNot slut shaming = \u201cHey, can you please put on something a little less revealing, or at least stop dancing so sexually when you\u2019re around your family, and underage cousins? It\u2019s just a little inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAlso, just to add my own personal experience, I wear thong bikinis when I\u2019m go to the beach with my fianc\u00e9, or my friends. But I\u2019ll wear a less revealing one when I\u2019m out with my brother, parents, or teenage cousins. Because no shit. It\u2019s just not appropriate for the occasion, or who I\u2019m with.\n\nThis really shouldn\u2019t be that hard to understand.", "She's not wearing a bikini; she's wearing strings. It's not \"slut shaming\" - it's just important to recognize context (people, place and purpose) when dressing. You wear that to a work party, you're fired. Here, she's got place right (the beach or a pool) but people and purpose wrong.", "I'd make fun of my son, I'd give him all kinds of shit, I'd laugh my ass off, but my 17 year old can dress himself and deal with my annoying ass.  Oh, I'm an atheist as well.  Is that a thing we're doing now?", "a clear outline of a penis under skimpy material is no where near as benign as a butt in a thong bikini. Stop trying to compare peaches with bananas!", "Vro really went with I am an atheist unprompted lmao", "As much logic as there is self awareness from these commenters saying you xan't force others to abide by your standards, while forcing theirs on OP (and probably other women) lmao", "That\u2019s fair, at least in some cases, I suppose. Im used to thinking of it as \u201creforming it into a different society\u201d I guess.", "In Rio de Janeiro you absolutely cannot.

I went to every store to try to find one for my sister and could not.", "I\u2019m sure there is somewhere you can get a bikini in this country that would cover your ass. But I have literally never seen one despite trying to buy one for my sister", "It isn't appropriate to where a thong to a family outing where you have kids. \n\nIf you are with your partner or with a group of friends at a pool or beach party in a more adult environment then go right ahead. But of course that means having nuance and not being obtuse", "If I felt confident in it, I'd wear it on any trip to the beach where my brother, dad, aunt, etc wouldn't see my ass on full display. I just think that's strange. Obviously opinions differ.", "Her \u201ctits\u201d are not out. They were covered by a bikini.", "Are you being purposefully obtuse? She can still wear a bikini, she just doesn\u2019t have to wear a THONG. She can still be comfortable and so can her aunt. Everyone wins.", "I'm not changing the subject, i said her whole ass being out is going to make people uncomfortable, that is exactly what a thong bikini does is exposes virtually your whole ass. There is a difference between strangers and family, yes the aunt could have been more civil about it however.", "I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m replying to all these slut shamers in an angry rage and I got confused. My apologies. We are agreeing and I\u2019ve just gone at you. Agreed that we should no sexualize and bodies, especially children.", "There\u2019s no Bible Belt in Canada and I\u2019m in Brazil.

That is a fact.", "How exactly is she hurting anyone? For Christs sakes, it's a piece of cloth that covers genitals. If it's doing that, what's the problem? Are there official rules on what is or isn't allowed as far as clothing is concerned, or do we just call those laws, which she didn't break?", "You're being very weird about someone just dancing. What exactly is wrong with dancing in a bikini? You go to any beach and there will be people wearing bikinis and likely dancing if there's music. Harms nobody.", "> She is bringing sexuality into an environment where it is unwelcome, and making others feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe aunt is the one who called her a slut, which clearly made her uncomfortable. She didn't do anything sexual. You are also sexualizing her.", "OP expressed that she doesn't live in a conservative country. I don't think a thong swimsuit is considered lewd. My family visited Disney this year, and there were plenty of women wearing thong swimsuits at Typhoon lagoon. A few months later we were in Canada, and visited many beaches in BC. Again, plenty of thong swimsuits. \n\nWear a thong swimsuit is not inherently sexual, and if an individual thinks that it is, then the same must be true for women who show cleavage, or skin in general, right? Sorry, but I'm not buying it.", "Maybe you were looking for something that\u2019s too modest by Brazilian standards? Because bigger brands like Vix, Farm, cia. Mar\u00edtima, Salinas etc. will all for sure offer medium coverage bottoms.

Who cares who sees it? It\u2019s a bikini. At a beach. In the sun. In the water. How is this any different than a person in an ill-fitting swimsuit where half of their (skin/ass/fat/gut/whatever) hangs out? Or a naked little kid? Seriously. The dad was getting an ass-chewing from his prude of a sister, obviously, and started being made to feel guilty. Stand up for the daughter you raised! OP is an adult.", "How will it make them uncomfortable? Will they get chest pains? Become short of breath? Have a panic attack?

I can't speak about the whole Western World but in my country it would be crazy to even think twice about someone wearing a bikini at the beach or at a pool... Kids seeing people in swimwear in the beach is simply not a concern regardless of how revealing the swimsuit might be.", "You see a few trashy people at Disney and figure that\u2019s now the cultural norm? You see thongs at the beach and figure that\u2019s how people hang out with their extended family now? \n\nI do think that cheeks out are becoming more normalized, and in 10 years no one will think you\u2019re being overtly sexual by wearing a thong bikini.

I\u2019m sure the aunt would have a problem with them", "None of the people I described were trashy though. They were like anyone, just having a good time. They just had less cloth on their bikini than others. But I didn't see any nipples or assholes, so seriously, what's the big fucking deal?\n\nOP is fine, and doesn't need to change anything. There's nothing overtly sexual about wearing a thong bikini. If you think there is, you're the problem.", "Ah. There you have it"]}
