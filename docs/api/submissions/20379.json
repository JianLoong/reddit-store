He does not get a say in that and he has to be made very clear of that immediately. He has over stepped & if you allow it uncheck, he will continue to over step.

Your housemate doesn't want you having sex when he's home? That's invasive of your privacy. Unless you absolutely howl with abandon, he can put on headphones for a bit.

Just so you know most roommates don't try to impose rules on when you're allowed to hook up in your private space. Now if you were in the living room or something sure, that's a little different.

Even then, that's a rule that he should've told you before you moved in. But if you're both renting a shared space then this is a ridiculous request. It's nice that you're trying to be considerate, but you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA\n\nThis is your home. Flatmate has a thing for you.

I had a friend over. We were really enjoying ourselves, not concerned about being loud and never heard them come in. When we were done, I went to go to the kitchen to get us some water and as soon as I opened my bedroom door, they started cheering, giggling and making jokes. Then, drunkenly entered my room, introduced themselves to my date and started asking super awkward questions.

This isn't a normal roomie reaction and the fact that he knocked on the door, sat on the couch, and just glared at you silently when you came out to see what was up is just bizarre bordering on creepy. Combine that reaction with his being much older than you - ick. \n\nIf nothing else, just keep an eye out for more possessive behavior from him moving forward. If he was just a friend acting this way that's one thing, but its someone you live with, which makes it more urgent, imo. If a friend decides to overstep you can lock them out. Can't lock out this guy.\n\nInfo: do yall have a door camera or something? Seems awfully convenient that he comes home early the one time you have someone of the opposite sex over.", "NTA.
