I've been living with my flatmate for a few months. He usually comes back from work around 10 pm every day. In the past few weeks, I've never seen him come home before that time. I'm on summer vacation so the hours of when I'm home vary all the time.\n\nA few days ago, my friend comes over in the afternoon. Things heat up and we start having sex. I'm not sure if this is important, but this was completely unplanned, we've never done anything like this before. We started around 6:30 / 7, in my head way before he'll come home. Surprise, surprise, he comes back around 8. Neither my friend nor I hear him come in, but we hear a knock at my door. \n\nI rush to put my clothes back on, and I get out of my room and see him on our couch. We make eye contact, I go back to my room feeling very embarrassed and decide I'll talk to him about it tomorrow.\n\nWhen I talked to him the following day, he was upset and told me that it was not cool to have sex when he was home, which I completely understand. He asked me next time to warn him so that he could come home later. I tried to explain to him that he came home early and that I would of course never do that when he was there, but he didn't want to hear it.

Unless you were screaming and being mildly loud that sure i can see how that is wild. But what you do on your time in your room is none of his business and how cringe of him to want you to text him if you are about to bang every time.", "NTA. He\u2019s a flatmate, not a boyfriend.

You have separate rooms. It's not like a college dorm where he is in the same room as you in bunk or something. Have sex all you want, maybe consider trying to be quiet about it but he shouldn't be able to put a damper on the whole thing. When he has sex I guarantee he won't be thinking about how it makes you feel being in the same apartment. Or if he does he will at least try to be discreet about it. But probably won't refuse sex because his roommate is around. That weird to put a sanction on a grown womans relationships because he exists", "NTA - Although you shouldn\u2019t have discussed it at all IMO.

It\u2019s super weird he wants you to alert him before you do the devils disco every time.

Sock on the doorknob kind of deal.  Your roommate is jealous.", "NTA unless you know that your flatmate was into you.

What he should have done was LEAVE if it made him uncomfortable, like you said, you never do this, it was spontaneous and unplanned.  So if I came home unexpectedly and heard whats going on in YOUR room I would not just sit there and then knock.  Its not like you guys were all lathered up in the common area of the apartment.\n\nBottom line is he is in the wrong here with his response.  IF this happened to me, I would have left without you even knowing I was there.  Then, for whatever reason if I wanted to bring it up with you, I would say I walked in on you, immediately heard what was going on and left.  The only reason I bring it up is so if you heard me arrive or leave I didnt want you to think someone was trying to break in.\n\nYoure an adult with no worries here.", "NTA\n\nAssuming you only have sex in a private bedroom and aren\u2019t being loud, your flatmate has no business to police when you have sex *in your own space*. Certain noises like the bed moving cannot be silenced completely. \n\nHe\u2019s being controlling and creepy. If he doesn\u2019t want even the possibility of hearing quieter sex noises he should live alone.", "NTA\n\nAnd he is completely out of line. He is controlling & using shaming as a tactic. He is wrong. He needs to be told he is wrong loudly. \n\nYou are a tenant paying rent. You can have sex with any consenting adult you want in your room at any time you want. He does not control when you have sex. You are a grown woman paying to live there. If you were having sex in the common area I\u2019d understand, but your own room. NO. He does not get a say in that and he has to be made very clear of that immediately. He has over stepped & if you allow it uncheck, he will continue to over step. You can have people over in your room. You can have sex with them. His geographic location has no affect on those rights of yours as a consenting adult. \n\nI will give him, if you & your partners are really loud, politely asking you to keep it down if sound travels is reasonable. But what he is asking is unreasonable.", "NTA, it's not like you were going at it on the sofa", "May. He should ah e I stepped that you were literally having sex while he was SUPPOSED to be working. He came home early. This is the ONLY reason he was home while you were doing it. He is being unreasonable. You have nothing to feel sorry for. He probably is jealous imo.", "NTA. What? Sorry, what? Your housemate doesn't want you having sex when he's home? That's invasive of your privacy. Unless you absolutely howl with abandon, he can put on headphones for a bit. It's unreasonable to expect an adult not to fuck in their own room. As long as you were not in a common space, he needs to back waaaaaay off.", "\"When I talked to him the following day, he was upset and told me that it was not cool to have sex when he was home, which I completely understand.\"\n\nWell I don't. Just so you know most roommates don't try to impose rules on when you're allowed to hook up in your private space. Now if you were in the living room or something sure, that's a little different. But this is your bedroom, it's none of his business. He could turn on the TV and crank up the volume a bit if you're being loud or something. But it's not normal to try and tell another adult when they're allowed to hook up.\n\nThe only way he really has a foot to stand on here is if you're renting out of a house that he owns. Even then, that's a rule that he should've told you before you moved in. But if you're both renting a shared space then this is a ridiculous request. It's nice that you're trying to be considerate, but you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA\n\nThis is your home. Flatmate has a thing for you. That's why he was pissy and interrupted you, rather than bounce for a bit like any normal person would do.", "NTA it\u2019s an unreasonable request if you are in your own room", "NTA. At all. You're allowed to have sex even when he's home, assuming you have your own room with its own door that closes. Sounds like he wants you to himself...", "NTA. There are two proper responses when you come home and your roommate is getting it on. You either laugh and cheer when you hear that final creak of the bedsprings and then brew them a pot of coffee, or you yell \"keep it down you animals, some of us are trying to watch tv\". Because, as the roommate, you are only impacted by the noise. \n\nHe's into you and things are about to get creepy. Time to move out before you find jars of your hair in his room", "NTA\u2026 you pay rent, it\u2019s your room, have sex whenever you want you\u2019re a whole damn adult. It\u2019s not like you were banging in the living room.", "Yeah, I was waiting for any details like:\n\nBut he caught me on the counter (It wasn't there).    \nSaw me bangin' on the sofa (It wasn't there).  \nI even had him in the shower (It wasn't there).  \n\nOwn room and not screaming for hours? Screw off.", "Literally I'd be like ooo this film looks good and walk straight back out lol", "There with you\u2026 only way you interrupt someone having sex and wait on the couch. Else he could just have left and brought it up the next day", "The only way op could be an ah is how my brain took the title at first, that op waited till room mate got home to start \ud83d\ude08", "Shit, even if she knew she wouldn't be an asshole.", "So she shouldn't have sex with someone she's interested in if she knows someone she isn't interested in is interested in her?", "He didn't even have to leave. He could have turned on some music or the television or put on some headphones or retreated to his room so he didnt hear anything.  Many better options than knock on OPs door and pout on the couch.", "I think they meant it would be better for her, the op, to let him know feelings aren\u2019t mutual but then again it still isn\u2019t her fault she doesn\u2019t feel the same way and he\u2019ll just have to move on", "Yeah that sounded a bit incely", "Sure there are many things he could have done, I would think \"low key\" would be best suited though.  So turn the music or television on and she hears it in between breaths would be the same as knocking on door to me.\n\nSomething tells me if this guy were to have stayed, regardless of headphones or other noise, she would have walked out to find him curled up in a corner crying."]}
