I am a cardiologist, and have been for the past 22 years. I was also a single mother to my 16 year old daughter who passed away 2 months before her 17th birthday in 2020. She had cancer when she was 14 and was in remission on her 16 th birthday. One day, she just collapsed. it happened in front of me, I was the one who gave her CPR. It was the worst feeling of my life, and I still have nightmares about it. We took her to the hospital but she was gone. \n\nShe was dealing with a lot of side effects from her treatment and was very weak, but she was determined to get better. But her body just gave out. on my daughter's birthday in 2021, I was a mess. My brother, future SIL and mum had been keeping me company because I couldn't function at all. We were just talking about some happy memories and my brother expressed sadness that his niece won't be at his wedding. My future SIL then chimed up and said yeah well that's sad, and if [my name] had been better at her job, she would've been alive. She justified it by saying that she was close to my daughter and made her a bridesmaid, she was devastated too by her death. \n\nTo this day, i cannot describe what I felt when I heard those words from her mouth. I don't remember much after that but I just starting sobbing. My mom and my brother were glaring at my SIL and they left. As if my guilt already wasnt enough. \n\nThey're getting married and my brother came over to invite me personally. I told him I am not coming, I don't want to see her face at all. My brother said that I should let bygones be bygones, and my grief is not the only one that matters. I pretty much limited contact after that incident but I'm not ready to face her. it serves as a reminder of my own failure and I still deal with a lot of guilt. But he's my only sibling, and we used to be very close.

Even if this were true, what's that got to do with a wedding?", "I think I could ever marry a person who literally blamed a grieving parent for their child dying of cancer complications. \n\nI\u2019m really certain I would absolutely never marry a person who said it to my own sibling if I had one. \n\nWhy did your brother not dump her ass the second she said it?", "NTA \nFirstly - it was not your fault and her comment was wrong and toxic. I\u2019m sorry you lost your daughter and I\u2019m sorry your brother is choosing to bring a animal into your family. \n\nSecond - she didn\u2019t apologise but doubled down and tried to justify? Why would you be present to celebrate this animal joining your family. Your brother shouldn\u2019t come in telling you to let bygones - he should be telling this person she damaged his sister and needs to fix it.", "When my brother died my aunt said outloud: well I was so worried I had to spend a lot of money in his wedding, now I don't have to worry anymore (he was engaged).\n\n20 years passed, I never forgot, never forgive. still hate her\n\nNTA", "Nta; I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I\u2019m surprised your brother would still want to marry her after such a horrendous comment", "NTA. First, OP I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. The amount of trauma you\u2019ve gone through is unthinkable and all your feelings about the situation are completely valid. I do hope you have sought/are seeking therapy to help process this grief, guilt and immense loss. It is not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t go through this alone. \n\nOn to the situation: labeling what your SIL said as a \u201cbygone\u201d is incredibly diminutive. What she said twisted the knife even deeper into your already devastating wound. You were traumatized by this situation on so many levels and she decides it\u2019s a good idea to *blame* you for your own daughter\u2019s death?! And you\u2019re supposed to just\u2026move on from that?? Fuck that. What she said was one of the most horrible things you could possibly say to someone. I wouldn\u2019t say it to my worst enemy. Her own grief is not an excuse to be cruel and evil to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that on top of losing your daughter, you\u2019ve had to deal with such shitty behavior from the people who should\u2019ve been your support system. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s affected your relationship with your brother. However, how he is even still with her after a comment like that is beyond me. It is not your responsibility to make amends with her. It\u2019s hers to grovel for forgiveness at your feet.", "NTA. Your SIL is a weapons-grade asshole though. I can\u2019t believe anyone would say that to someone grieving over the death of their daughter.", "Has SiL ever apologised for that comment? Absolutely NTA if she hasn't, it was a truly horrific thing to say.", "NTA\n\nThat's probably one of the meanest comments possible in this situation. This doesn't just go away and if you don't want to see her, that's more than justified.", "Let me guess. Your future SIL is one of those people who attempts to justify their obnoxious rudeness with 'I just tell it how it is!!'. Horrible.\n\nWhat she said was unforgivable and there is no way I would ever be ready to see her again. Your brother's comment about your grief not being the only one that matters is not much better and the fact he is still marrying this woman after what she said tells me that you should probably limit contact with him, too.\n\nI'm so sorry for everything you've been through and you're absolutely, 100% NTA for not wanting to go to your brother's wedding.", "Your SIL is a freakin' a55hole! It wasn't your fault. \ud83d\udc9b And if attending that wedding is going to make you spiral down, please save yourself the trouble. NTA.", "NTA never ever. Your brother is for marrying her though and I know that sounds extreme but seriously how could you marry someone who has that mindset and who speaks those words out loud, let alone to the grieving mother. \n\nGo book yourself in to do something you and your daughter enjoyed together on the wedding date. Reflect and remember x sending you all the healing love and condolences.", "Oh wow. I have teenage daughters and this post hits me hard. But first thing - YOU ARE NOT AN AHOLE AND YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. I wish I could see you and hug you and tell you how incredibly wrong your SIL is. You have suffered the worst thing a mother could go through. They won\u2019t EVER be able to relate so them telling you to get over it might as well be advice from a child. \n\nA good friend of mine goes to a grief therapy group that has helped her a lot. Many churches have one that is free and for any believer/non-believer. Think about it \n\nSkip the wedding. Tell your brother that you will consider a relationship with them after you SIL comes to you apologizing and telling you how wrong she was. Otherwise tell them to go f*ck themselves. \n\nMy daughters are the center of my world. I cannot even imagine what your days are like. Please know that you are not,and I\u2019ll say it a thousand times if I have to, a failure. And you\u2019re def not an AHole. You were and still are an incredible mother and no one can take that away from you.", "NTA. Your pain drips from the post into my heart.  You must do whatever you feel is necessary to get better.  Brother means well, but doesn't understand the depth of your feeling.  From experience I know the sorrow of the loss of a child.  It's been 66 years and sometimes it feels like yesterday.", "What the flying fuck was your SIL thinking?? Why the flying fuck is your brother willing to marry someone who can utter those words?? Unless there are missing pieces to this story, I'm completely confused by your SIL.", "My goodness. NTA and I\u2019d never speak to her again.", "NTA beware of that person. She\u2019s a literal definition of a bad senseless person. You don\u2019t have to go through that. You don\u2019t deserve that abuse. Fuck that. Im so sorry for your loss. You deserve better treatment from your family as well. Like I can not believe that your own brother would not see his fianc\u00e9 like a totally different person after that horrible gross comment. Brother screams red flags too. Focus on your healing process, in your peace and happiness.", "Wow. You shouldn\u2019t have to ever see her again. That your brother is still marrying her after those comments is awful.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou need to keep them well away from you while you heal.", "NTA, also it\u2019s sad that your brother is marrying an absolute idiot.", "I've read a lot if AITA. I've never had my jaw drop before.  NTA. And i think less if your brother for marrying that.... person", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss, and I want you to know that losing her was not your fault. She was sick, she fought, you all did, but eventually she lost. It's devastating, it's unfair, it was nobody's fault.\n\nThat comment from your SIL was disgusting though. Did she even apologize for it? It's well within your rights to tell your brother that a person who is able to make such a comment will never be family to you, and you don't want to celebrate or accept her. I mean, what's next? When your parents die it'll be your fault too? Will she blame you for every medical misfortune in your family in perpetuity because technically you could help? F#$* that! You're justified in not supporting that marriage.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're feeling so broken. Firstly, I suggest you see a clinical psychologist who specialises in a type of trauma therapy called EMDR. The process will be difficult but very effective in the long term. \n\nYour SIL's comment was appalling and unforgivable. You've made an assumption that because you're a trained medical professional, that you have the power to save all lives, and yet people die every day surrounded by ER doctors, specialists, nurses and paramedics. I can see how the devastation of losing your daughter, when you have all this training would be especially difficult, but it wasn't your lack of CPR knowledge that took her life. \n\nThis is such a tragic trauma, and you need help (with the psychologist) to break down the sequence of events to understand how you were not responsible. Your SIL's comment hurt all the more because you believe there is some truth in it. There isn't. \n\n\nYour brother is minimising the harm caused by your SIL. He doesn't get to decide when/if and how you process that. He just wants it all nice and perfect for his wedding. His future wife is the person he should be focusing on. He should be making her give a profuse and authentic apology. However, I seriously doubt you'll get one. If she is capable of saying something this bad to you, I would keep her at arm's length from now on. \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd think about going to the church part of the wedding, where I wouldn't have to speak to many people, or her, then I'd leave straight afterwards. Having said that, if you feel that you would be betraying yourself by attending any part of it, then that takes priority and I'd stay away.\n\n\nI really feel for you. I hope peace comes to you eventually.", "FUCK THEM ALL THE WAY TO HELL.\nNTA. Sorry you had to endure this crap. \nApologies for my language. But really!?", "NTA. What she said was absolutely wrong and all I can say is I hope that what she said was her not thinking properly and not getting the right words out at a time that is incredibly difficult, at a time where no one knows what to say or do. I hope she at the very least apologised for her insensitivity and clarified that those words are not correct, because they aren't.\n\nI can understand not waiting to go to the wedding, but also I would encourage you not to lose that relationship with your brother. It puts him in a difficult situation, if you feel able I would recommend reaching out to him and your SIL and talking about what her words have done and how they have made you feel and stuck with you over the years. Give her the opportunity to really understand how powerful words can be and the chance to make it right with you. Perhaps speak with your brother first so he can explain to her, if that's a better way of going about it.\n\nRight now and for many years to come it's important to have your family support and love around you, it sounds like the relationship you share with your brother is an incredibly special one, try not to isolate yourself and remove yourself from the special times you can share with family. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and wish you all the best in your future. \n\nI also want to thank you for your work, it's people like you who have saved lives of people like me. Thank you.", "Oh my heart just broke for you. You are not at fault. You did everything you could for daughter. It\u2019s an awful twist of fate that you were there with her for her first and last breaths. While no consolation is at all possible, or could ever reduce your grief and trauma, please consider that when she went you daughter had her Mum right there with her and fighting for her with all her heart. I imagine if you\u2019d not been there with her, your daughter may have been scared and lonely. Instead she was loved and fought for, and in the most capable hands. \n\nThe only AH in this story is your brother for marrying this woman.  She\u2019s something much worse than a AH. \n\nNTA at all. Big love for you Mumma x", "That she chose this incident to insult you is incredible. I think she harbors a lot of jealousy regarding your successful career, and couldn\u2019t resist taking a swipe at you\u2026but about your own daughter, it\u2019s beyond horrible. Of all the things she could have said about your daughter\u2019s death,she chose to knock your skill as a physician. It\u2019s a \u2018tell\u2019.
