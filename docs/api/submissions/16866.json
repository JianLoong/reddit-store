I am a cardiologist, and have been for the past 22 years. I was also a single mother to my 16 year old daughter who passed away 2 months before her 17th birthday in 2020. She had cancer when she was 14 and was in remission on her 16 th birthday. One day, she just collapsed. it happened in front of me, I was the one who gave her CPR. It was the worst feeling of my life, and I still have nightmares about it. We took her to the hospital but she was gone. \n\nShe was dealing with a lot of side effects from her treatment and was very weak, but she was determined to get better. But her body just gave out. on my daughter's birthday in 2021, I was a mess. My brother, future SIL and mum had been keeping me company because I couldn't function at all. We were just talking about some happy memories and my brother expressed sadness that his niece won't be at his wedding. My future SIL then chimed up and said yeah well that's sad, and if [my name] had been better at her job, she would've been alive. She justified it by saying that she was close to my daughter and made her a bridesmaid, she was devastated too by her death. \n\nTo this day, i cannot describe what I felt when I heard those words from her mouth. I don't remember much after that but I just starting sobbing. My mom and my brother were glaring at my SIL and they left. As if my guilt already wasnt enough. \n\nThey're getting married and my brother came over to invite me personally. I told him I am not coming, I don't want to see her face at all. My brother said that I should let bygones be bygones, and my grief is not the only one that matters. I pretty much limited contact after that incident but I'm not ready to face her. it serves as a reminder of my own failure and I still deal with a lot of guilt. But he's my only sibling, and we used to be very close. He's helped me a lot through all this. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I just got back from work and I'm reading your responses. Thank you for your support and kind words. \n\nThe doctor part of my mind does know that what till cancer takes on one's body, but the mom part of me will probably never get over it. I am in therapy and some days are more of a struggle than rest. \n\nTo clarify, my SIL did not apologize. My mom told me that she meant that since I've worked in hospitals, I've seen deaths and I should work throught my pain. I am still conflicted on whether or not I should attend their wedding because my daughter was so so excited and determined to get better for it. I want to support my brother and my SIL because I did spiral down after my daughter's death and they quite literally sustained me. They've cooked meals, and tidied up my house. I feel I haven't been supportive of their grief journey.", "created_utc": 1683704911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13djpe8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 1687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if this were true, what's that got to do with a wedding?", "I think I could ever marry a person who literally blamed a grieving parent for their child dying of cancer complications. \n\nI\u2019m really certain I would absolutely never marry a person who said it to my own sibling if I had one. \n\nWhy did your brother not dump her ass the second she said it?", "NTA \nFirstly - it was not your fault and her comment was wrong and toxic. I\u2019m sorry you lost your daughter and I\u2019m sorry your brother is choosing to bring a animal into your family. \n\nSecond - she didn\u2019t apologise but doubled down and tried to justify? Why would you be present to celebrate this animal joining your family. Your brother shouldn\u2019t come in telling you to let bygones - he should be telling this person she damaged his sister and needs to fix it.", "When my brother died my aunt said outloud: well I was so worried I had to spend a lot of money in his wedding, now I don't have to worry anymore (he was engaged).\n\n20 years passed, I never forgot, never forgive. still hate her\n\nNTA", "Nta; I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I\u2019m surprised your brother would still want to marry her after such a horrendous comment", "NTA. First, OP I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. The amount of trauma you\u2019ve gone through is unthinkable and all your feelings about the situation are completely valid. I do hope you have sought/are seeking therapy to help process this grief, guilt and immense loss. It is not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t go through this alone. \n\nOn to the situation: labeling what your SIL said as a \u201cbygone\u201d is incredibly diminutive. What she said twisted the knife even deeper into your already devastating wound. You were traumatized by this situation on so many levels and she decides it\u2019s a good idea to *blame* you for your own daughter\u2019s death?! And you\u2019re supposed to just\u2026move on from that?? Fuck that. What she said was one of the most horrible things you could possibly say to someone. I wouldn\u2019t say it to my worst enemy. Her own grief is not an excuse to be cruel and evil to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that on top of losing your daughter, you\u2019ve had to deal with such shitty behavior from the people who should\u2019ve been your support system. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s affected your relationship with your brother. However, how he is even still with her after a comment like that is beyond me. It is not your responsibility to make amends with her. It\u2019s hers to grovel for forgiveness at your feet.", "NTA. Your SIL is a weapons-grade asshole though. I can\u2019t believe anyone would say that to someone grieving over the death of their daughter.", "Has SiL ever apologised for that comment? Absolutely NTA if she hasn't, it was a truly horrific thing to say.", "NTA\n\nThat's probably one of the meanest comments possible in this situation. This doesn't just go away and if you don't want to see her, that's more than justified.", "Let me guess. Your future SIL is one of those people who attempts to justify their obnoxious rudeness with 'I just tell it how it is!!'. Horrible.\n\nWhat she said was unforgivable and there is no way I would ever be ready to see her again. Your brother's comment about your grief not being the only one that matters is not much better and the fact he is still marrying this woman after what she said tells me that you should probably limit contact with him, too.\n\nI'm so sorry for everything you've been through and you're absolutely, 100% NTA for not wanting to go to your brother's wedding.", "Your SIL is a freakin' a55hole! It wasn't your fault. \ud83d\udc9b And if attending that wedding is going to make you spiral down, please save yourself the trouble. NTA.", "NTA never ever. Your brother is for marrying her though and I know that sounds extreme but seriously how could you marry someone who has that mindset and who speaks those words out loud, let alone to the grieving mother. \n\nGo book yourself in to do something you and your daughter enjoyed together on the wedding date. Reflect and remember x sending you all the healing love and condolences.", "Oh wow. I have teenage daughters and this post hits me hard. But first thing - YOU ARE NOT AN AHOLE AND YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. I wish I could see you and hug you and tell you how incredibly wrong your SIL is. You have suffered the worst thing a mother could go through. They won\u2019t EVER be able to relate so them telling you to get over it might as well be advice from a child. \n\nA good friend of mine goes to a grief therapy group that has helped her a lot. Many churches have one that is free and for any believer/non-believer. Think about it \n\nSkip the wedding. Tell your brother that you will consider a relationship with them after your SIL comes to you apologizing and telling you how wrong she was. Otherwise tell them to go f*ck themselves. \n\nMy daughters are the center of my world. I cannot even imagine what your days are like. Please know that you are not,and I\u2019ll say it a thousand times if I have to, a failure. And you\u2019re def not an AHole. You were and still are an incredible mother and no one can take that away from you.", "NTA. Your pain drips from the post into my heart.  You must do whatever you feel is necessary to get better.

It's been 66 years and sometimes it feels like yesterday.", "What the flying fuck was your SIL thinking?? Why the flying fuck is your brother willing to marry someone who can utter those words?? Unless there are missing pieces to this story, I'm completely confused by your SIL.", "My goodness. NTA and I\u2019d never speak to her again.", "NTA beware of that person. She\u2019s a literal definition of a bad senseless person. You don\u2019t have to go through that. You don\u2019t deserve that abuse. Fuck that. Im so sorry for your loss. You deserve better treatment from your family as well. Like I can not believe that your own brother would not see his fianc\u00e9 like a totally different person after that horrible gross comment. Brother screams red flags too. Focus on your healing process, in your peace and happiness.", "Wow. You shouldn\u2019t have to ever see her again. That your brother is still marrying her after those comments is awful.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou need to keep them well away from you while you heal.", "NTA, also it\u2019s sad that your brother is marrying an absolute idiot.", "I've read a lot if AITA. I've never had my jaw drop before.  NTA. And i think less if your brother for marrying that.... person", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss, and I want you to know that losing her was not your fault. She was sick, she fought, you all did, but eventually she lost. It's devastating, it's unfair, it was nobody's fault.\n\nThat comment from your SIL was disgusting though. Did she even apologize for it? It's well within your rights to tell your brother that a person who is able to make such a comment will never be family to you, and you don't want to celebrate or accept her. I mean, what's next? When your parents die it'll be your fault too? Will she blame you for every medical misfortune in your family in perpetuity because technically you could help? F#$* that! You're justified in not supporting that marriage.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're feeling so broken. Firstly, I suggest you see a clinical psychologist who specialises in a type of trauma therapy called EMDR. The process will be difficult but very effective in the long term. \n\nYour SIL's comment was appalling and unforgivable. You've made an assumption that because you're a trained medical professional, that you have the power to save all lives, and yet people die every day surrounded by ER doctors, specialists, nurses and paramedics. I can see how the devastation of losing your daughter, when you have all this training would be especially difficult, but it wasn't your lack of CPR knowledge that took her life. \n\nThis is such a tragic trauma, and you need help (with the psychologist) to break down the sequence of events to understand how you were not responsible. Your SIL's comment hurt all the more because you believe there is some truth in it. There isn't. \n\n\nYour brother is minimising the harm caused by your SIL. He doesn't get to decide when/if and how you process that. He just wants it all nice and perfect for his wedding. His future wife is the person he should be focusing on. He should be making her give a profuse and authentic apology. However, I seriously doubt you'll get one. If she is capable of saying something this bad to you, I would keep her at arm's length from now on. \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd think about going to the church part of the wedding, where I wouldn't have to speak to many people, or her, then I'd leave straight afterwards. Having said that, if you feel that you would be betraying yourself by attending any part of it, then that takes priority and I'd stay away.\n\n\nI really feel for you. I hope peace comes to you eventually.", "FUCK THEM ALL THE WAY TO HELL.\nNTA. Sorry you had to endure this crap. \nApologies for my language. But really!?", "NTA. What she said was absolutely wrong and all I can say is I hope that what she said was her not thinking properly and not getting the right words out at a time that is incredibly difficult, at a time where no one knows what to say or do. I hope she at the very least apologised for her insensitivity and clarified that those words are not correct, because they aren't.\n\nI can understand not waiting to go to the wedding, but also I would encourage you not to lose that relationship with your brother. It puts him in a difficult situation, if you feel able I would recommend reaching out to him and your SIL and talking about what her words have done and how they have made you feel and stuck with you over the years. Give her the opportunity to really understand how powerful words can be and the chance to make it right with you. Perhaps speak with your brother first so he can explain to her, if that's a better way of going about it.\n\nRight now and for many years to come it's important to have your family support and love around you, it sounds like the relationship you share with your brother is an incredibly special one, try not to isolate yourself and remove yourself from the special times you can share with family. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and wish you all the best in your future. \n\nI also want to thank you for your work, it's people like you who have saved lives of people like me. Thank you.", "Oh my heart just broke for you. You are not at fault. You did everything you could for daughter. It\u2019s an awful twist of fate that you were there with her for her first and last breaths. While no consolation is at all possible, or could ever reduce your grief and trauma, please consider that when she went you daughter had her Mum right there with her and fighting for her with all her heart. I imagine if you\u2019d not been there with her, your daughter may have been scared and lonely. Instead she was loved and fought for, and in the most capable hands. \n\nThe only AH in this story is your brother for marrying this woman.  She\u2019s something much worse than a AH. \n\nNTA at all. Big love for you Mumma x", "That she chose this incident to insult you is incredible. I think she harbors a lot of jealousy regarding your successful career, and couldn\u2019t resist taking a swipe at you\u2026but about your own daughter, it\u2019s beyond horrible. Of all the things she could have said about your daughter\u2019s death,she chose to knock your skill as a physician. It\u2019s a \u2018tell\u2019.

Cancer sucks and it frequently wins no matter what we do. I'm so so sorry that you lost your daughter.

No excuses.", "I had a family member who blames me for my adopted child\u2019s SA.  That was my breaking point.  That family member will never come into my home again.  They treated me like an outsider, not real family and I accepted that they were not able to love well. They were told by 4 other people they were wrong.  She called me and brought it up a second time. I firmly told her off. She never apologized.  Told her to talk with a mental health expert or call the hotline to understand the whole of the matter.  My adopted child inherited a terrible mental illness from his bio family.  The adult child has only done as well as they have because we busted our asses teaching coping skills, finding the best therapists and care.  She\u2019s not aware of the previous attempts.  She\u2019s oblivious to the stress that child\u2019s illness brings to the family and the danger the adult child brings To me.   She doesn\u2019t see me as family. Great.  I\u2019m done. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.  The trauma that day brought you and helplessness you must have felt with your daughter.

Blaming someone for the death of their child, especially when they so obviously did all they could and the death was never their fault to begin with, is simply evil. Your brother being OK with that is... well, he's not as close to you as you are to him, apparently. \n\nIf someone I was dating talked that way to one of my step siblings (even the ones I don't like and think are nut jobs) there would be an immediate and dramatic removal of that person from my life. Out a window. There certainly wouldn't be an awkward moment where I tried to convince my step sibling to pretend that what happened was somehow OK, or even forgivable.", "Oh my god.

By the sound of it, there wasn\u2019t one. Evidently, you were expected to slowly forget over the last two years, get over your pain and grief, and then play happy families. That\u2019s beyond cruel, and your family is completely deluded if they thought that was going to happen. \n\nYou are entirely within your right not to go to this wedding. You are entirely within your right to never see them again. Honestly, I\u2019m shocked your brother and mother managed to forgive her at all. If someone said that to my sibling after they lost a child, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be marrying them. \n\nYour grief matters. Your baby matters. Your mental health matters. Their wedding, not so much, especially considering the way your brother just spoke to you. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask, but I feel like you need to hear this from someone. I\u2019m sure you are an absolutely amazing cardiologist, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve saved dozens of lives. But your daughters illness isn\u2019t your fault.

Nope. Nope. NTA. You may someday want to forgive her, if she ever realizes what she did and sincerely apologizes and seeks that forgiveness. \n\nThe idea that you should spontaneously let bygones be bygones puts the whole thing on the injured party.

And then you get your brother getting frustrated because you seem like you don\u2019t want to join the joys of his world when your life fell apart.\n\nOne cannot simply \u201cmove on\u201d and call that awful incident a \u201cbygone\u201d. How you grieve, how long it takes, and IF you decide to forgive your SIL, it\u2019s up to you. They\u2019re minimizing what happened and tbh they will not understand grief to the point of really being in your shoes. Do not expect that from them and find comfort in those who can truly understand how horrible and deep is the pain of losing someone as dear as a your daughter.\n\nLastly, do what you feel is best for you. They say that not everything is about your grief, implying that you\u2019re selfish. But know that you are not. You\u2019re traumatized by seeing your daughter die, you are still very much in pain and grief. It is not something you can \u201cturn off\u201d for the sake of someone else, as much as you love them. The only way is through healing.

I'm sorry for your loss OP.", "OP you are very much NTA. I lost my child after a loooong fight with HLHS (had first two stage surgeries and complications with tricuspid regurge, resulting in heart transplant and trach). Nothing, absolutely NOTHING you can do when their bodies are so weak from the treatments already. I still beat myself up on it, I tell myself constantly I should've advocated better, should've been faster to realize when something was going wrong. I will never get over it. As the parents, we will NEVER get over it. And honestly, no one's grief measures up to ours about our own children. I felt the exact moment her heart stopped beating. You having to do CPR on your daughter is a testament to your strength and resilience and love for her. You lost a part of yourself when she died, and I am sending the biggest of internet hugs.\n\n  \n\n\nYour SIL is a despicable human for saying that to you, and I would suggest, if you feel up to it, either talking to your brother or texting him the reason. Maybe it's time to go No Contact for a bit so you can try and heal. Bygones will never be bygones in this case. What she said will haunt you for the rest of your days. It's horrible! But our minds latch on to these instances and they will rip open wounds as you're already feeling down. I've cut out the people who said far less terrible but still very hurtful things about my child. It's time to protect yourself, your heart, and for them to realize how deep that comment cut.\n\n  \n\n\nOP, you are a wonderful parent, you did absolutely everything you could've done for your daughter and I truly believe she watches over you and will love you from afar.

Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise, and I am so sorry for your loss. Fuck cancer.\n\nThere's a special place in hell for your sil for saying something so disgusting, and anyone who enables that either through brushing it off or telling you to get over it will be keeping her company.

I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re still in touch with such inhumane people, but as a doctor you should know what toxic environments and people do to one\u2019s mental health. The help they did does not atone the bad they also did, besides, it was their \u201cobligation\u201d - as someone who is close to you - to try and help you get past this death. That\u2019s what friends and family are for, are they not?! \n\nAlso, you never even got an apology, which means it was not perceived by others as a lie or a mean thing to say to someone who is/going to be family, nor someone who just lost her child literally after thinking everything was starting to get better.

Your future SIL is a real heartless treat.  Even if she apologized (which she hasn't!) I still wouldn't go.

I'm really sorry for your loss, I can't even imagine.  I'm also sorry that your \"support system\" is so awful.", " *I feel I haven't been supportive of their grief journey.*\n\nI don't want to compare grief but I would say that your grief is deeper and more painful that theirs. You were her mother, you carried that child and bonded with her. You had hopes and dreams for her that were cruelly taken away from you.  To make matters worse, you were with her in her final moments. You knew that she was in remission and thought that she would pull through but suddenly she was gone. That's hard to sort through.\n\n*My future SIL then chimed up and said yeah well that's sad, and if \\[my name\\] had been better at her job, she would've been alive. She justified it by saying that she was close to my daughter and made her a bridesmaid, she was devastated too by her death.* \n\n*To clarify, my SIL did not apologize. My mom told me that she meant that since I've worked in hospitals, I've seen deaths and I should work through my pain.*\n\nI don't care what she meant- it is an incredibly insensitive and cruel thing to say to say to someone who has just lost their child. There is no way that you could have prevented this tragedy so don't feel guilty. And pain of death hits differently when it is your own kin rather than a stranger. You feel sad that Mrs. Brown died but there are so much more complex emotions when your child dies. You did all that you could do in these moments so your daughters death was not your fault. If your SIL lost her child to SID's would she want someone to say, well it's your fault that your baby died, maybe you should have been a better mother?\n\n*They're getting married and my brother came over to invite me personally. I told him I am not coming, I don't want to see her face at all. My brother said that I should let bygones be bygones, and my grief is not the only one that matters. I pretty much limited contact after that incident but I'm not ready to face her. it serves as a reminder of my own failure and I still deal with a lot of guilt. But he's my only sibling, and we used to be very close. He's helped me a lot through all this.*\n\nPart of this is survivors guilt. You feel guilty for being alive while your child is dead. You would give anything to have her back, maybe even trade places with her. Your therapist is probably letting you come to the realization that none of this was your fault. You did all you could for your daughter throughout her illness and she knew how much you loved her. Sometimes things happen and people die and there is nothing that you can do to stop it. You had your daughter for 16 wonderful years and nothing can replace that. Your brother and SIL don't realize how much the loss of a child can affect a parent. It's easy to say 'Move on' if you are not dealing with shattered dreams and painful memories.\n\nDon't go to this wedding, especially since your SIL did not apologize. It would bring up to many painful memories of her cruelty (and I would never marry anyone who said that to my grieving sibling). Write a short note saying that you wish them well but there are too many painful associations with this event and you can not go. Continue to work with your therapist and continue limiting contact with them. You will work through your grief on your own time table. Somedays will be fine and somedays all you'll want to do is to curl up and sob your eyes out.

Basically a \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in attendance and here\u2019s why\u201d kinda thing. If OP does it at the wedding, bro and SIL can use it as ammunition for years to come.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT!\u00a0 NOTHING good would come from a toast like this.\u00a0 Revenge may be sweet, but I guarantee most of the people at the wedding will not see it that way.\u00a0 In the future, the OP will be talked about and avoided.\u00a0 The OP will be considered spiteful, vindictive, and malicious by the vast majority of the people that attend the wedding and will most likely have to be protected as she is escorted out.\u00a0\n\nThis is not a good idea.", "THIS!! YES PLEASE", "That's good but IMO I wouldn't go there.  I would just not go to the wedding and would cut out the brother and the SIL until she apologies (at least).\n\nIMO saying something like this at the wedding will end up overshadowing everything else that happens that day.  It will be talked about by everybody there.  Each time the wedding comes up, this will come up too.\n\nIMO this will just end up dragging OP into more of a mess.  It will give SIL more ammunition and might get some of her family on OP's ass.  It would probably lead to stress for OP that she doesn't want or need right now.  I agree it would really \"hit the spot\" at the time, but IMO it's not worth it.  I would reserve that sort of speech for years down the road, if I'm asked over and over and over why I cut them out.", "The way my heart dropped when I read what was said...not only is op dealing with the loss of a daughter,she is dealing with the consequences of not being able to save her own child, as well as seeing her pass...\n\nAnd now the sil with a disgustingly loaded statement that op failed as a doctor and a mother and because she failed to save her own kid she has inconvenienced her sil as well as her brother and all this on the daughter's birthday no less....", "I think that he didn\u2019t dump SIL because he agrees with her. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing is this story to suggest that either the mother or brother disagrees with what the SIL is saying, only that they disagree with SIL saying something to OP. Glaring at SIL and leaving is a woefully inadequate response if they are horrified and disagree, but it tracks if they think that the SIL is right, just insensitive.", "Completely agree, brother is TA for not dumping his fiance immediately when this happened. OP, stop wasting your love on someone so completely heartless.", "I wouldn\u2019t ever even want to be in the same room as someone that was capable of saying that to my sister, much less marry them. How dare they act like their grief is anywhere near yours as a parent, especially after trying to pile on guilt and then expect that since OP deals with death at work, that it\u2019s the same as losing your child. If that\u2019s the kind of care and empathy brother and SIL have, I hope they never reproduce. I\u2019d honestly wash my hands of both of them. As far as I\u2019m concerned the brother is worse than SIL and both should never be spoken to again.", "No! Take the glass with you. Don't waste good champagne.", "And in a white dress as well\u2026but then I\u2019m petty that way\u2026or maybe just enough off white or patterned or embroidered or something so that it isn\u2019t a \u2018wedding dress\u2019.", "Yeah, I'm really off put by all the suggestions (not just in this post) about making a big dramatic spectacle like this is some daytime soap opera and not a real person's life. OP is still clearly grieving and I can't see how this would, in any way, be beneficial for them. If she wants to tell loved ones why she won't be in attendance, she should go for it. Doing something obnoxious at a big gathering like a wedding will only escalate the situation, add fuel to the fire, and possibly set OP back **massively** in their grieving process", "I just had a sudden angry flash of imagining a solid backhand, and I feel soothed.  Maybe that says more about me but on super rare occasions a shocking strike is the way", "What do you have against potatoes?! \ud83d\ude02 I like that term emotionally stunted potato", " I would absolutely never marry a person who said it to my own sibling if I had one.\n\nWhy did your brother not dump her ass the second she said it?", "  That comment is a no-contact worthy comment.", "I\u2019m really certain I would absolutely never marry a person who said it to my own sibling if I had one.\n\nWhy did your brother not dump her ass the second she said it?", "I don't know about that. It's such an obvious faux pas and OP shouldn't give up the high ground in this."]}
