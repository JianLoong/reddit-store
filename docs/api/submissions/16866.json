She had cancer when she was 14 and was in remission on her 16 th birthday. One day, she just collapsed. it happened in front of me, I was the one who gave her CPR. It was the worst feeling of my life, and I still have nightmares about it. We took her to the hospital but she was gone. \n\nShe was dealing with a lot of side effects from her treatment and was very weak, but she was determined to get better. But her body just gave out. on my daughter's birthday in 2021, I was a mess. My brother, future SIL and mum had been keeping me company because I couldn't function at all. We were just talking about some happy memories and my brother expressed sadness that his niece won't be at his wedding. My future SIL then chimed up and said yeah well that's sad, and if [my name] had been better at her job, she would've been alive. She justified it by saying that she was close to my daughter and made her a bridesmaid, she was devastated too by her death. \n\nTo this day, i cannot describe what I felt when I heard those words from her mouth. I don't remember much after that but I just starting sobbing. My mom and my brother were glaring at my SIL and they left. As if my guilt already wasnt enough. \n\nThey're getting married and my brother came over to invite me personally. I told him I am not coming, I don't want to see her face at all. My brother said that I should let bygones be bygones, and my grief is not the only one that matters. I pretty much limited contact after that incident but I'm not ready to face her. it serves as a reminder of my own failure and I still deal with a lot of guilt.

Even if this were true, what's that got to do with a wedding?", "I think I could ever marry a person who literally blamed a grieving parent for their child dying of cancer complications. \n\nI\u2019m really certain I would absolutely never marry a person who said it to my own sibling if I had one. \n\nWhy did your brother not dump her ass the second she said it?", "NTA \nFirstly - it was not your fault and her comment was wrong and toxic. I\u2019m sorry you lost your daughter and I\u2019m sorry your brother is choosing to bring a animal into your family. \n\nSecond - she didn\u2019t apologise but doubled down and tried to justify? Why would you be present to celebrate this animal joining your family. Your brother shouldn\u2019t come in telling you to let bygones - he should be telling this person she damaged his sister and needs to fix it.", "When my brother died my aunt said outloud: well I was so worried I had to spend a lot of money in his wedding, now I don't have to worry anymore (he was engaged).\n\n20 years passed, I never forgot, never forgive. still hate her\n\nNTA", "Nta; I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I\u2019m surprised your brother would still want to marry her after such a horrendous comment", "NTA. First, OP I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss. The amount of trauma you\u2019ve gone through is unthinkable and all your feelings about the situation are completely valid. I do hope you have sought/are seeking therapy to help process this grief, guilt and immense loss. It is not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t go through this alone. \n\nOn to the situation: labeling what your SIL said as a \u201cbygone\u201d is incredibly diminutive. What she said twisted the knife even deeper into your already devastating wound. You were traumatized by this situation on so many levels and she decides it\u2019s a good idea to *blame* you for your own daughter\u2019s death?! And you\u2019re supposed to just\u2026move on from that?? Fuck that. What she said was one of the most horrible things you could possibly say to someone. I wouldn\u2019t say it to my worst enemy. Her own grief is not an excuse to be cruel and evil to you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that on top of losing your daughter, you\u2019ve had to deal with such shitty behavior from the people who should\u2019ve been your support system. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s affected your relationship with your brother. However, how he is even still with her after a comment like that is beyond me. It is not your responsibility to make amends with her. It\u2019s hers to grovel for forgiveness at your feet.", "NTA. Your SIL is a weapons-grade asshole though. I can\u2019t believe anyone would say that to someone grieving over the death of their daughter.", "Has SiL ever apologised for that comment? Absolutely NTA if she hasn't, it was a truly horrific thing to say.", "NTA\n\nThat's probably one of the meanest comments possible in this situation. This doesn't just go away and if you don't want to see her, that's more than justified.", "Let me guess. Your future SIL is one of those people who attempts to justify their obnoxious rudeness with 'I just tell it how it is!!'. Horrible.\n\nWhat she said was unforgivable and there is no way I would ever be ready to see her again. Your brother's comment about your grief not being the only one that matters is not much better and the fact he is still marrying this woman after what she said tells me that you should probably limit contact with him, too.\n\nI'm so sorry for everything you've been through and you're absolutely, 100% NTA for not wanting to go to your brother's wedding.", "Your SIL is a freakin' a55hole! It wasn't your fault. \ud83d\udc9b And if attending that wedding is going to make you spiral down, please save yourself the trouble. NTA.", "NTA never ever. Your brother is for marrying her though and I know that sounds extreme but seriously how could you marry someone who has that mindset and who speaks those words out loud, let alone to the grieving mother. \n\nGo book yourself in to do something you and your daughter enjoyed together on the wedding date. Reflect and remember x sending you all the healing love and condolences.", "Oh wow. I have teenage daughters and this post hits me hard. But first thing - YOU ARE NOT AN AHOLE AND YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE. I wish I could see you and hug you and tell you how incredibly wrong your SIL is. You have suffered the worst thing a mother could go through. They won\u2019t EVER be able to relate so them telling you to get over it might as well be advice from a child. \n\nA good friend of mine goes to a grief therapy group that has helped her a lot. Many churches have one that is free and for any believer/non-believer. Think about it \n\nSkip the wedding. Tell your brother that you will consider a relationship with them after you SIL comes to you apologizing and telling you how wrong she was. Otherwise tell them to go f*ck themselves. \n\nMy daughters are the center of my world. I cannot even imagine what your days are like. Please know that you are not,and I\u2019ll say it a thousand times if I have to, a failure. And you\u2019re def not an AHole. You were and still are an incredible mother and no one can take that away from you.", "NTA. Your pain drips from the post into my heart.  You must do whatever you feel is necessary to get better.  Brother means well, but doesn't understand the depth of your feeling.  From experience I know the sorrow of the loss of a child.  It's been 66 years and sometimes it feels like yesterday.", "What the flying fuck was your SIL thinking?? Why the flying fuck is your brother willing to marry someone who can utter those words?? Unless there are missing pieces to this story, I'm completely confused by your SIL.", "My goodness. NTA and I\u2019d never speak to her again.", "NTA beware of that person. She\u2019s a literal definition of a bad senseless person. You don\u2019t have to go through that. You don\u2019t deserve that abuse. Fuck that. Im so sorry for your loss. You deserve better treatment from your family as well. Like I can not believe that your own brother would not see his fianc\u00e9 like a totally different person after that horrible gross comment. Brother screams red flags too. Focus on your healing process, in your peace and happiness.", "Wow. You shouldn\u2019t have to ever see her again. That your brother is still marrying her after those comments is awful.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou need to keep them well away from you while you heal.", "NTA, also it\u2019s sad that your brother is marrying an absolute idiot.", "I've read a lot if AITA. I've never had my jaw drop before.  NTA. And i think less if your brother for marrying that.... person", "NTA\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss, and I want you to know that losing her was not your fault. She was sick, she fought, you all did, but eventually she lost. It's devastating, it's unfair, it was nobody's fault.\n\nThat comment from your SIL was disgusting though. Did she even apologize for it? It's well within your rights to tell your brother that a person who is able to make such a comment will never be family to you, and you don't want to celebrate or accept her. I mean, what's next? When your parents die it'll be your fault too? Will she blame you for every medical misfortune in your family in perpetuity because technically you could help? F#$* that! You're justified in not supporting that marriage.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're feeling so broken. Firstly, I suggest you see a clinical psychologist who specialises in a type of trauma therapy called EMDR. The process will be difficult but very effective in the long term. \n\nYour SIL's comment was appalling and unforgivable. You've made an assumption that because you're a trained medical professional, that you have the power to save all lives, and yet people die every day surrounded by ER doctors, specialists, nurses and paramedics. I can see how the devastation of losing your daughter, when you have all this training would be especially difficult, but it wasn't your lack of CPR knowledge that took her life. \n\nThis is such a tragic trauma, and you need help (with the psychologist) to break down the sequence of events to understand how you were not responsible. Your SIL's comment hurt all the more because you believe there is some truth in it. There isn't. \n\n\nYour brother is minimising the harm caused by your SIL. He doesn't get to decide when/if and how you process that. He just wants it all nice and perfect for his wedding. His future wife is the person he should be focusing on. He should be making her give a profuse and authentic apology. However, I seriously doubt you'll get one. If she is capable of saying something this bad to you, I would keep her at arm's length from now on. \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd think about going to the church part of the wedding, where I wouldn't have to speak to many people, or her, then I'd leave straight afterwards. Having said that, if you feel that you would be betraying yourself by attending any part of it, then that takes priority and I'd stay away.\n\n\nI really feel for you. I hope peace comes to you eventually.", "FUCK THEM ALL THE WAY TO HELL.\nNTA. Sorry you had to endure this crap. \nApologies for my language. But really!?", "NTA. What she said was absolutely wrong and all I can say is I hope that what she said was her not thinking properly and not getting the right words out at a time that is incredibly difficult, at a time where no one knows what to say or do. I hope she at the very least apologised for her insensitivity and clarified that those words are not correct, because they aren't.\n\nI can understand not waiting to go to the wedding, but also I would encourage you not to lose that relationship with your brother. It puts him in a difficult situation, if you feel able I would recommend reaching out to him and your SIL and talking about what her words have done and how they have made you feel and stuck with you over the years. Give her the opportunity to really understand how powerful words can be and the chance to make it right with you. Perhaps speak with your brother first so he can explain to her, if that's a better way of going about it.\n\nRight now and for many years to come it's important to have your family support and love around you, it sounds like the relationship you share with your brother is an incredibly special one, try not to isolate yourself and remove yourself from the special times you can share with family. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and wish you all the best in your future. \n\nI also want to thank you for your work, it's people like you who have saved lives of people like me. Thank you.", "Oh my heart just broke for you. You are not at fault. You did everything you could for daughter. It\u2019s an awful twist of fate that you were there with her for her first and last breaths. While no consolation is at all possible, or could ever reduce your grief and trauma, please consider that when she went you daughter had her Mum right there with her and fighting for her with all her heart. I imagine if you\u2019d not been there with her, your daughter may have been scared and lonely. Instead she was loved and fought for, and in the most capable hands. \n\nThe only AH in this story is your brother for marrying this woman.  She\u2019s something much worse than a AH. \n\nNTA at all. Big love for you Mumma x", "That she chose this incident to insult you is incredible. I think she harbors a lot of jealousy regarding your successful career, and couldn\u2019t resist taking a swipe at you\u2026but about your own daughter, it\u2019s beyond horrible. Of all the things she could have said about your daughter\u2019s death,she chose to knock your skill as a physician. It\u2019s a \u2018tell\u2019.

She blamed you for not saving your daughters life. She tried making your daughter's death your fault. \n\nI wouldn't want to see her face again ever.", "NTA\n\nWhat a monstrous thing to say. No excuses.", "I had a family member who blames me for my adopted child\u2019s SA.  That was my breaking point.  That family member will never come into my home again.  They treated me like an outsider, not real family and I accepted that they were not able to love well. They were told by 4 other people they were wrong.  She called me and brought it up a second time. I firmly told her off. She never apologized.  Told her to talk with a mental health expert or call the hotline to understand the whole of the matter.  My adopted child inherited a terrible mental illness from his bio family.  The adult child has only done as well as they have because we busted our asses teaching coping skills, finding the best therapists and care.  She\u2019s not aware of the previous attempts.  She\u2019s oblivious to the stress that child\u2019s illness brings to the family and the danger the adult child brings To me.   She doesn\u2019t see me as family. Great.  I\u2019m done. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.  The trauma that day brought you and helplessness you must have felt with your daughter.  People who say that you need to get over that are so unkind.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry that your brother, who you are apparently close to, thinks that his future wife saying such things isn't a ground to kick her out of his life and find someone less of an asshole to marry. \n\nI wouldn't find you overreacted if you never spoke another word to him, let alone his wife. Blaming someone for the death of their child, especially when they so obviously did all they could and the death was never their fault to begin with, is simply evil. Your brother being OK with that is... well, he's not as close to you as you are to him, apparently. \n\nIf someone I was dating talked that way to one of my step siblings (even the ones I don't like and think are nut jobs) there would be an immediate and dramatic removal of that person from my life. Out a window. There certainly wouldn't be an awkward moment where I tried to convince my step sibling to pretend that what happened was somehow OK, or even forgivable.", "Oh my god. I am so, so sorry. \n\nNTA. This isn\u2019t bad blood. This isn\u2019t something you forgive and forget. What your future SIL said is downright disgusting, heartless, and entirely without empathy.\n\nHad there been a genuine apology, with no expectation of forgiveness, from your future SIL, then this would be a slightly different conversation. By the sound of it, there wasn\u2019t one. Evidently, you were expected to slowly forget over the last two years, get over your pain and grief, and then play happy families. That\u2019s beyond cruel, and your family is completely deluded if they thought that was going to happen. \n\nYou are entirely within your right not to go to this wedding. You are entirely within your right to never see them again. Honestly, I\u2019m shocked your brother and mother managed to forgive her at all. If someone said that to my sibling after they lost a child, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be marrying them. \n\nYour grief matters. Your baby matters. Your mental health matters. Their wedding, not so much, especially considering the way your brother just spoke to you. \n\nI know you didn\u2019t ask, but I feel like you need to hear this from someone. I\u2019m sure you are an absolutely amazing cardiologist, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve saved dozens of lives. But your daughters illness isn\u2019t your fault. By the sound of it, you did everything you could. You gave her unconditional love and support, and you tried your goddamn hardest to keep her happy and healthy and here. That\u2019s all anyone can ask of you, and I am so incredibly sorry that anyone has implied otherwise.", "READ this carefully....THere was NOTHING you could have done. You could have had AED, epi, atropine with multiple lines and gtts and she still would have passed. Her body was tired and her soul was ready. The living feel the lose but the dead at peace. She is at peace...now your SIL is beyond a AH . The pain she caused you is not a bygone.  Don't go to to the wedding. You don't need it", "My mother and sister lived a similar situation, my father passed before them, they couldn't save him.\n\nThis taught me one thing, not everyone will show grace to your grief, trauma and sorrow. It's on them. You have every right to be mad and express that the way you feel.\n\nLife has robbed you, now you deserve to put yourself first before such selfish people now. Also if you had a teenage daughter who fought so hard at such a young age, I'm pretty sure this badass would want you to kick brother and SIL ass for being so dumb. So don't let them make you go past  their cruel words. \n\nI'm sending you a big virtual hug, you are an amazing mom for how much you fought with your daughter.", "NTA. And your SIL is absolutely disgusting. Shame on her for saying such hurtful stuff. \n\nOP, what happened wasn't your fault. Please find it in your heart to forgive yourself, so you can start healing.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m sure you did a perfect job. I would have nothing to do with either of them for the foreseeable future.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. Also, tell anyone who objects to your not going to the wedding that your brother's insistence on marrying someone who blamed you for your daughter's death is much bigger offence against decency than you never wanting to see that person again.", "Nope. Nope. Nope. NTA. You may someday want to forgive her, if she ever realizes what she did and sincerely apologizes and seeks that forgiveness. \n\nThe idea that you should spontaneously let bygones be bygones puts the whole thing on the injured party. It is and always has been bullshit.", "NTA. The thing about grief, is that once you lose someone so dear your world stops. And no matter how much you try, you are frozen in this state where your mind can\u2019t even start to understand how to get it going again when you feel all that pain.\n\nShe did such incredible damage by saying something so horribly vile in such a mindless way.\nIt is incredibly painful to see that the world keeps moving without you, and this pain won\u2019t let you join. And then you get your brother getting frustrated because you seem like you don\u2019t want to join the joys of his world when your life fell apart.\n\nOne cannot simply \u201cmove on\u201d and call that awful incident a \u201cbygone\u201d. How you grieve, how long it takes, and IF you decide to forgive your SIL, it\u2019s up to you. They\u2019re minimizing what happened and tbh they will not understand grief to the point of really being in your shoes. Do not expect that from them and find comfort in those who can truly understand how horrible and deep is the pain of losing someone as dear as a your daughter.\n\nLastly, do what you feel is best for you. They say that not everything is about your grief, implying that you\u2019re selfish. But know that you are not. You\u2019re traumatized by seeing your daughter die, you are still very much in pain and grief. It is not something you can \u201cturn off\u201d for the sake of someone else, as much as you love them. The only way is through healing. So skip that wedding if that\u2019s what you choose to do, and do not run the risk of inflicting damage on yourself for the sake of others. \n \nMy deepest condolences \n\nPs: NTA\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m sorry for your loss. This is the ultimate loss for any parent. It\u2019s crazy that your brother is going to marry this woman. She\u2019s the worst person to celebrate bringing into your family.", "NTA. But you have to know that your daughter's death isn't your fault. You went to medical school, you became a cardiologist, so you are obviously a scientist.\n\nYou know this in your brain.

That was a very hostile thing to say. Why would your brother expect you to want to celebrate his marriage to a person who was so cruel to you?", "NTA. What she said was unforgivable.

Apologizing and then all over again and it should be clearly sincere, before I would even think of forgiving her for such a statement. Never mind considering going to their wedding.", "NTA\n\nIf you aren't ready to forgive her then don't go. And I think it goes without saying that everyone's grief is relevant.

You didn't fail, it was a shitty thing that happened, a ticking time bomb nobody knew about, but you were there with her.

As the parents, we will NEVER get over it. And honestly, no one's grief measures up to ours about our own children. I felt the exact moment her heart stopped beating. You having to do CPR on your daughter is a testament to your strength and resilience and love for her. You lost a part of yourself when she died, and I am sending the biggest of internet hugs.\n\n  \n\n\nYour SIL is a despicable human for saying that to you, and I would suggest, if you feel up to it, either talking to your brother or texting him the reason. Maybe it's time to go No Contact for a bit so you can try and heal. Bygones will never be bygones in this case. What she said will haunt you for the rest of your days. It's horrible! But our minds latch on to these instances and they will rip open wounds as you're already feeling down. I've cut out the people who said far less terrible but still very hurtful things about my child. It's time to protect yourself, your heart, and for them to realize how deep that comment cut.\n\n  \n\n\nOP, you are a wonderful parent, you did absolutely everything you could've done for your daughter and I truly believe she watches over you and will love you from afar. Sending all the internet love and hugs I can to you, one mother of an angel to another. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nUgh, I'm so sorry, OP. You would not be wrong to never see that woman again.\n\nIt sounds like you love your brother. Maybe attend the wedding and be clearly curt and minimal contact with her, so that it's clear you're there for your brother ONLY. But if you don't want to look at her and can't attend, that's on HER for creating the situation.", "NTA and I'd NEVER let either of them forget what she said. She deserves to have someone stand up during speeches at the wedding and tell everyone present. I know you don't want to do that and I'm not even suggesting, I think you're right to avoid her. \n\nI know it means nothing coming from Reddit strangers but you're not a failure. I'm so fucking sorry.", "NTA\n\nIt will be challenging to keep the relationship with him without her, but\u2026\n\nsHE should have apologized and SHE should have invited you", "NTA. Even the best paramedics and doctors in the world lose people. \n\nThe fact that you had the presence of mind to do CPR on your daughter in the first place is amazing. A lot of people think it's super easy and that it should come naturally to do that to a loved on but it really isn't. \n\nYour daughter dying is not your failure and the last thing she most likely remembered is her father fighting for her.  \n\n\nYour SIL and brother are monsters. SIL for her comment and your brother for thinking that being told something like that is \"bygones\"", "NTA.\n\nI have to say, this is a bit triggering for me, as I lost my father to brain cancer at a very young age. Let me be absolutely clear, You are NOT to blame for your daughter's death. You fought like hell to keep her alive, but it was the cancer's fault for tipping the scale against you. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise, and I am so sorry for your loss. Fuck cancer.\n\nThere's a special place in hell for your sil for saying something so disgusting, and anyone who enables that either through brushing it off or telling you to get over it will be keeping her company. If I were in your brother's shoes and my fianc\u00e9e said something like that to my sister, she would be an ex-fianc\u00e9e immediately.", "NTA!!! Your SIL on the other hand is a horrible monster.\n\nYour bro not much better than her with his bygones comment.  She hasn't even apologized for her comment - not that it would matter really...\n\nI hope they see this post and realizes how much of an AH they are.", "Also that's her DAUGHTER. So her grief is the most important one especially since she tried to save her life after she collapsed in front of her. They don't deserve to have OP there after that remark.\n\nAlso, OP it is not your fault. I know it feels like that, but it most certainly isn't.", "Has she even ever apologised?", "[removed]", "Seriously. I would be tempted to tell Brother that if he\u2019s the type of person who would marry such an awful person, I don\u2019t need either of them in my life ever again.", "FOR REALLLLLLLLLL.  I would have wondered if she was bodysnatched honestly because who thinks that, let alone says it????", "yup. glaring at her is not enough of a reaction, i\u2019d have popped the fuck off", "I could see it. If the parent did not seek treatment for their kid or treated them with a chiropractor and essential oils but little to nothing else..... Yeah, you're a bad parent. \n\nBut as far as saying it to their face? That's cold.", "WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF", "Oh my god", "Beautifully written, and though I've already left my own comment, I'll say it again here OP, NTA.", "yeah this is one of those moments where i\u2019m just distraught that OP even felt like she had to ask for input", "there is no scenario in which OP is TA", "AND him! He'd be dead to me for enabling that shit.", "same. i\u2019ve never felt more upset that a person felt the need to ask", "The brother is supporting an evil snake who literally told this mother she killed her child. \n\nYes, of course, THE MOTHER is the one that needs to reach out and do the work and make amends. /s\n\nAlso, no she did not apologize, the snake just doubled down\n\u201c She justified it by saying that she was close to my daughter and made her a bridesmaid, she was devastated too by her death.\u201d", "He's lucky you didn't hurt him. NTA I am so sorry for your loss, it is absolutely not your fault. I hope you find some peace", "I\u2019m going to go with a hard \u201cNo.\u201d from the sounds of it. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to say anything other what what the SIL said was so callous and uncalled for. \n\nBut the petty in me says you know what, mend that fence with SIL for the moment. Offer to go\u2014 in fact, offer to make a toast. \n\n\u201cBrother, SIL, I\u2019m glad to be here today in honor of my daughter who was supposed to be a bridesmaid. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful for SIL telling me that if I was better at my job, I could have saved my daughter whose body had been ravaged by her treatment for her cancer.. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful that she made those comments on my daughters birthday during the first year after her passing, all while I was grieving a birthday she wouldn\u2019t get.\n\nI\u2019m also grateful to you brother for sticking by his woman so steadfastly and demanding to \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d.

There is no coming back from what she said, even if she worked extremely hard to prove she was sorry, which sounds like she is not. I have lost my sister to cancer; the guilt kills me that I feel like I should have done more, and I am not a doctor. I cannot imagine being a doctor and feeling the way she does. You already blame yourself; the SIL made her feel like it was her fault at time she was already grieving. So NTA, apology or not.", "Exactly what SIL AND brother did. \n\nI\u2019d be absolutely disgusted and feel irrevocably betrayed by my sibling for sticking by someone who said this to their sibling much less in the midst of grief.
