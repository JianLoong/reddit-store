I had a beautiful ceremony up in the mountains overlooking a lake. It was a nice quick ceremony. Then we had a beautiful dinner after dinner we had speeches from both the maid of honor and best friend. the whole wedding was supposed to be less than people, but it was still supposed to be cocktail and a little bit formal which I specified at the invitations. After the speeches, everybody kind of got together in the living room.(the cabin was really big if it up to 30 people comfortably) when I saw that everybody was looking at a fight that was on. I told my husband (M29) thought it was upsetting me that instead of celebrating the wedding, they were just watching TV. I asked him to shut it off and tell everybody to go outside and enjoy the party. Instead he argued with me and told me that it would only take 20 minutes. We later talked about it. He understood he was in the wrong and how this was very important to me. I ended up asking them myself. Everybody just looked at me if I was crazy. This caused me to have a panic attack and very keep myself in one of the bathrooms for about an hour. My husband was with me the whole time trying to call me down. they eventually turn TV off and starting and joining the wedding but this whole issue ruined the wedding for me. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Was I the asshole for asking them to turn it off?", "created_utc": 1694816259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jqnzd/aita_for_asking_my_guests_to_shut_off_the_tv/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They agreed to join your day and celebrate with you, so that is what they should have done.", "NTA\n\nThat's the height of rudeness on the part of your guests.  Their conduct was disgusting and unforgivable.", "NTA, I think I'd have a panic attack if I just spent all that time and money on a wedding just to find out during the wedding that I'd have to get an annulment.", "INFO: after dinner and speeches what were people supposed to do? Besides \u201cbe cocktail and a little bit formal\u201d? And what does \u201cbe cocktail\u201d mean?", "NTA. Short of a terrorist attack like the World Trade Center. I cannot comprehend any justification for turning on a television during someone's wedding reception. That's just hillbilly rude.", "ESH/NAH - whoever turned on the TV was if not invited or given permission to do so, but as a host, if there are no events imminent and your guests are so bored they'd rather watch TV, why wouldn't you just let them be until the next event?  Obviously they prefer it.", "i\u2019d be more worried that a tv set caused you a panic attack, i hope you are seeing a professional to help you work on this.", "My former SIL got married when the local MLB team was playing in the post-season  (we live in a huge baseball town & this was during a very successful few years for the team).  They set up a separate room with TVs so people people could duck out of the reception to check in on the game.  The bride didn't feel slighted & her guests had a great time.  It's amazing how much less stress one has when they focus on other people instead of themselves.", "NAH from me. It sounds like a very informal event, just like a backyard BBQ. Probably people were relaxed, chilling out, having a chat, someone put on the telly and found something interesting to watch. \n\nI understand why the OP find this upsetting (my wedding was on the same evening as a Champions League final so I defo know how it is - quite annoying).\n\nBut one forgets that one\u2019s wedding is only extremely important to them, not to everyone else. For everyone else it is *just* a party. They were there to have fun, and they did.", "If you are going to have a tv at your wedding reception somebody is going to turn it on. And if you turn it off somebody else will turn it on. And again and again. Removal of the tv prior to the event was the only way to keep this from happening. Rookie mistake. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude29\ud83e\udd23", "I'm not going to say  AH but maybe people saw it as an extension of the party of they were all hanging out together? I don't think there's anything wrong with asking them to turn it off.", "Sounds to me like the wedding part was over and the speeches were done and it would be right before the DJ would put on music.  I'm not sure i would have minded the 20 minutes if there was a TV there but I guess I may also be inflexible on my big day do NAH?", "NTA\nTurning the TV on at any party is incredibly rude!", "Not sure what this means\n\nthe whole wedding was supposed to be less than people\n\nIf some people were invited to some parts of the wedding but not other parts, I can understand them turning on the tv and maybe joining a less time sensitive part (for example cocktails) a bit late. It would be similar to a city wedding where when pictures are happening, not everyone will show up at the cocktail hour immediate on time.", "You had a panic attack over that? Really? This sounds so dramatic\u2026", "Eh a little YTA and NTA if they weren\u2019t watching the TV they may have just been standing around watching it on their phones. It sounds more like a simple dinner/casual wedding than formal\u2026 they were hanging out just not how you pictured it. If this caused an hour long panic attack I\u2019m really worried about you. If this was the one major hiccup in your big day I\u2019d say thing went pretty smoothly. The wedding is for the groom too and he didn\u2019t seem very bothered by it.", "ESH - except your husband.  The party, reception seemed to flow from the cabin to outside.  Should they be watching TV during this time? I wouldn't but I can see how some wouldn't think it's a big deal.  Instead of giving them the 20 minutes, you asked them to shut it off and because they looked at you funny - you had an hour long panic attack in the bathroom? And them watching TV ruined your whole wedding?  You seem kind of high maintenance and exhausting tbh. The idea that this one thing cancelled out your vows and the joy of being husband and wife? Maybe you need to shift your focus away from those watching TV and back to you and hubby and the beginning of your new chapter.", "I would like to have a tv at most weddings I've been too.

They are not at a sports bar. Your husband was 100% wrong to even justify it for a second. It\u2019s a special day that should be honored by your guests. All those attendees are Aholes as was your husband.", "Nta that\u2019s very rude of guests", "I do not give a judgement. But when I married there was an important soccer match of my country that evening. (I or my wife do not care much about soccer at all.) But I arranged a screen in a room for people to watch. I wanted a happy night for us and the guests. Everyone enjoyed it. Some have watched the whole game, and had fun (our country won :D ). Others watched sometimes the score and others didn't care just like us. It was a wonderful day.\n\nI do not say that you should have doing this, or that the guests had rights to watch TV. I think I am more on you POV than on theirs. But the problem I have is that you have now a ruined wedding day, and that's terrible. Maybe it is their fault, but let things go makes life so much easier.\n\nThe fact that your husband would enjoy that match is important to me too. That's why i do not give a final judgement. It is not only your day, also his.", "Nta.

Anyone who says differently has no social grace whatsoever and crapping on the bride being upset about her feelings is bullying. If people want to watch tv, then they should stay home and do so, not attend an event and decide the planned events aren\u2019t to their liking. OP, I am sure you had many lovely moments on your wedding day and you need to focus on them and stop letting your mind replay this. And in the future, when you have guests at your home, unplug your TV and hide the remote. Some people just need to be taught basic manners. Believe me, they will learn.", "What? It was their WEDDING. wtf?", "I'll preface this by saying I wouldn't be one of those watching the TV but I don't really see what the big deal is.  There doesn't seem to be any upcoming event affected by this and it's unlikely more than one or two hardcore types are truly intent on the TV.  More likely people are standing around it in small knots chatting as they glance at it from time to time.  It's only 20 minutes, kind of like a group cigarette break for the nonsmoking crowd if it helps you to think of it that way.", "Yes, I moved my wedding date for an important sports final where our regional team was competing at about 4pm, and afterwards an international soccer match was scheduled on the same day in the evening. \n\nI later heard my aunts talking about a wedding they attended on that day where the room was more than half empty for the speeches, as the guests (not just men) were spending the wedding day in the hotel bar instead of the function room. \n\nIf you have planned and paid for an event that doesn\u2019t involve sitting down watching sports on tv, but instead making the effort to socialise with people who have showed up to celebrate and support you, having the whole party watching TV instead can be so disappointing.  We have catch up! And highlights! Why not just go home if you can\u2019t live in the moment and be present for your friends/family?", "It's not at all uncommon during various playoff games among a wide swath of society from what I've gathered.  I don't care to watch sports but as long as it's not interfering with anything else, to each his own.  \n\nIt's also a good way to fill the occasional silences in a conversation with new acquaintances.", "This was my brothers wedding lol they setup a TV area with the college games playing so people could hangout and watch after the speeches and everything", "I dont know it was a ufc fight that happened September 9th. Till this day i dont know if it was \u201cimportant\u201d to sports fans. It happened around 9 I\u2019m guessing", "Honestly, I don\u2019t know who turned it on.

Savage.", "There is always the brilliant idea of removing remote controls so they can't use the tv, or unplug the tv. You could have hooked a phone up to it to play a slideshow of yours and hubby's life...", "Hey, I'm still working on \"are we human or are we dancer?\" and now you tell me there's a *third* option?\n\nMind blown.", "This made me laugh out loud.", "Ok, NTA. Small group of people for your wedding should be there to celebrate your marriage. A fight doesn't fit in with a wedding IMO.", "I didn\u2019t say she was TA, just so we\u2019re clear. And if you\u2019ve given a verdict of ESH, that vote actually includes the bride. I think you mean N T A(?).", "No, it was after the wedding and dinner.  People were both in the cabin and outside, how is a handful of people watching TV for 20 minutes enough to ruin her entire wedding? And really, an hour long panic attack....for a few people watching TV? While I wouldn't do it, but it wouldn't dim my day.", "I honestly wouldn't care if I was OP.  Cabin, beautiful landscape, just married the love of my life? I wouldn't even notice something like a few people watching a bit of TV and chilling.  I get the sense OP wanted all eyes on her from the vows, until the party was over.  Which is bizarre. I was trying to be generous, with the ESH but boy, I think OP's spouse is going to have his hands full with that one.", "You make a valid point, but we did miss our first dance because I had a panic attack again that can be totally my fault and another reason I\u2019m the asshole. Also, it was about 30 out of 50 guests who were standing or sitting on the couches watching the TV They were actively looking at the site, making noises when someone hit a good punch I guess and some just sitting there. I don\u2019t know enough about UFC to say if it was an important fight like the Super Bowl, but they were actively cheering and yelling while watching it.", "I had a cousin get married on superbowl Sunday. The hotel where it was at had a few  big screen tvs (back when they were giant boxes) in the lobby with it on. So before the wedding, between wedding and reception while they were doing pictures, and after the speeches and stuff during the reception, a vast majority of the attendents were watching the game. Made it super easy to find the groom though.", "I got married in the fall and there were 3 teams I had to be concerned about. Wedding was at 7PM\n\nOur Alma Mater played a morning away game. We got married in that city so the away part was doubly important. \n\nMy college team since birth was playing a squash game for homecoming, so no big deal. \n\nMy (groomsman) best friend\u2019s alma mater was on a bye week. \n\nMy wife isn\u2019t even a huge football fan but she totally understood.", "I wouldn\u2019t have expected anyone to spring for the TV\u2026 hindsight is 20/20", "Eh, I think you were shaming and I do think OP can figure out who I think the AH\u2019s are here (her husband, the people who put on the tv and everyone who didn\u2019t shut it off when she asked them.)", "focus was waning away from her, the panic attack was a bit dramatic. It was probably those few men who never wanted to attend to begin with, those who only went for the wives and girlfriends.", "Yeah, I get that \"all eyes on *me!\"* vibe too.", "So the majority of your guests are there having a good time that will end in a relatively brief period and not affect the flow of events at all, and you...*shut it down?*\n\nWas this a cry for attention or need for control or what?  A good host does not treat guests this way without cause.  It may not have been exactly what you had in mind for them to do but they were clearly enjoying themselves so where's the need?  Is there some harm I'm overlooking?", "You were just in a house? What did you expect them to do? What should they have been doing instead of watching the fight?", "I think that\u2019s just a fall wedding in the south lol. Alabama, Clemson, and Georgia games were a must", "Shaming? Yes. Did I call her TA? No. There\u2019s a difference.\n\nAs for the other, I was only telling you that because of the way the voting works on the sub. No other reason.", "yeah go outside and join the other guests. bunch of dudes hanging out by a tv is kinda what a bunch of dudes do after the main events.", "I hate it when people want their special wedding day to be about them \ud83d\ude44", "Okayyy you didn\u2019t call her TA but you did shame her for her feelings. Difference acknowledged. Hope your day is made. We are done here.", "If they were cutting the wedding cake or smthg, yes, i would agree with you. But in timeslots that are meant to just socialise i don't think its realistic to expect everyone just talking about the newlyweds and the party going on. Usually ppl walk around and do smalltalk about their lifes, their last vaccation, upcoming plans, work struggles, you name it. If some of them are watching a fight for half an hour, i don't see any harm in this. It can even help the guests to bond better than over some (boring) smalltalk. \n\nIn the end, as a host, you want your guest to enjoy themselfs and have a good time. That was always the purpose of parties. Its just since a few years that ppl invite to parties that are meant to be red carpet events for themself, so they are the star and everybody else is expected to act as a fan / admirerer. \n\nI think this is just a clash between what the bride expected (to be the star of the day and nothing else matters to her guests than her and hubby) and the guests who where there to experience the important moment of the hosts getting married (what they did) but also for the social hangout with peers afterwards.", "No events were going on during this so people were free to wander around and converse; instead of doing it outside, most viewers probably just glanced at the tv as they talked.  After her outburst though the topic of most convos probably did shift to being about the bride but not in ways she would have wished.", "\"we are done here\" haha, you're as dramatic as the OP", "I don't understand where you and others are getting the impression that the bride wanted all eyes on her all the time. Clearly she had the standard wedding entertainment and there was no reason for the guests to add their own entertainment to the mix. She simply just did not want the fight to be on during her special day.", "It was a continuation of the wedding reception. It is very clearly an event of some sort hosted by OP for her wedding. If it's not an event, then what exactly do you think it is?", "A pause between dinner and dancing most likely.", "And that makes it no longer part of the event in what way?", "It's not *an* event; i.e. unscripted."]}
