I will also add that this group of friends is all seniors, while me and my friend are juniors, I wanted to have a last Halloween with the group. My mom was already skeptical about me going to my friend\u2019s house in the first place because it\u2019s a long drive and I\u2019m not used to driving alone at night, especially in the rain and with possible drunk drivers in the road. I had a feeling based off of previous times I\u2019ve hung out with my friend vs the group that I would have more fun with the group than that individual friend, so I decided to cancel on my friend and spend Halloween with the group. Now I feel awful because I know my friend is mad at me but I have a feeling that in the long run, I\u2019ll have more fun. \n\nAITA?

Why did you invite your friend too at least?", "YTA, you said you would go then didnt", "YTA. You made a commitment, and you knew that you had to make that 30 minute drive at night before you made plans with your friend. What happened was you felt you had a better offer, so you canceled on a friend that you already had plans with. If you had said no to begin with due to the drive, that would be one thing, but you didn\u2019t. You let your friend get excited over plans you made and you canceled on her at the last minute, did you consider how this makes her feel?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
