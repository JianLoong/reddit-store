We decided to have a small, intimate ceremony with close friends and family. Among the potential guests was my stepsister, Emily (28F). We don't have a great relationship, but I didn't want to create unnecessary drama, so I intended to invite her and her husband.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue began when I shared our wedding date with the family. Emily immediately reacted negatively, saying our wedding was too close to her planned baby shower, which was scheduled for the following month. She accused me of \"stealing her thunder\" by having my wedding so close to her event.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked by her response because we had never discussed her baby shower date, and I couldn't have known about it when we chose our wedding date. I tried to explain this, but Emily insisted that I should have somehow known and adjusted our plans to accommodate her.\r  \n\r  \nThe tension escalated when Emily called a family meeting to discuss my \"selfishness\" in planning my wedding near her baby shower. During the meeting, she accused me of being inconsiderate and trying to overshadow her life events. The rest of our family members seemed torn, with some taking her side and others understanding my perspective.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I felt like I was being treated unfairly and that Emily was making unreasonable demands. So, I made the difficult decision to not invite her to our wedding, fearing that her presence would only add stress and tension to our special day.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our family is divided, and some family members are angry at me for not inviting Emily. She continues to claim that I'm the one who's being selfish and unreasonable.

And a wedding and celebrating the pregnancy and upcoming birth are two totally different events. Hopefully she'll calm down and apologize, and maybe possibly get herself invited again.

It\u2019s a month apart \n2.) You didn\u2019t know the date \n3.)

How many actual days/weeks are between the two events?\n\nIf the events are a week apart, it might put some stress on joint relatives in terms of time and money which you and her should both be considerate of.\n\nBut NTA regardless. Let\u2019s be clear. She doesn\u2019t have any thunder- except for her loud and aggressive accusations about this issue and that\u2019s more ass-like braying than brief booming meteorological phenomenon - and you aren\u2019t stealing it. \n\nEmily may have some underlying resentment about disparities in treatment between you and her that bubbled up or she may just be an ugly self-centered person. Unfortunately, if it\u2019s the first, she deliberately blew up any chance at salvaging a relationship by her public rancor and attempts to organize the family against you. You are not required by etiquette or morality to invite someone who is hatefully campaigning against you to your wedding.", "NTA.

Yeah, NTA", "Honestly, why are people so concerned with events when it is \"near\" a wedding date?

I'd simply state to those who are angry about you not inviting her due to her actions, that planning a wedding and the wedding day itself is stressful and emotional enough as it is and you don't want any undue drama or stress added. That you tried talking to her about the situation and she refused to listen. If they don't want to attend your wedding, that's on them, not you. End of story. \n\nDon't take this drama onto your shoulders. Brush it off. Live your life with your man. It's better to shake off people that want to cause division right from the go than to keep them hanging around causing you stress and anxiety.", "NTA   My family would try to work another baby shower in as an after party to the wedding to maximize baby gifts.   We\u2019d invite the grooms family to the shower too because, why not?  Nobody would care!  The fact your family took this whole thing seriously would make me consider leaving them all off the guest list.", "NTA - Anyone who thinks throwing themselves an event is giving themselves 'thunder' that can be 'stolen' is a total self absorbed asshole.

And the rest of the family who is on her side is crazy too", "NTA\n\nWhat is this calendar entitlement and why is your family enabling this over grown baby having a baby?", "NTA.\n\nBeing that the baby shower is in the following month altogether, it hardly overlaps with your wedding. Honestly, nobody but the couple involved actually cares about a wedding or baby shower after the day it's held, so no momentary thunder is being stolen. The fact that anyone in your family thinks she has a point is crazy, or just an enabler.\n\nJust how much of a buffer does Emily need around her baby shower to ensure maximum attention?\n\nOn one hand, I would invite Emily to the wedding anyway, because you'll never hear the end of it from the others. But if that's how you want to end the relationship, I think that's fair enough. You're all adults (in body, if not mind) and just because you're step-siblings, it doesn't mean you have to be at all involved in each other's lives going forward.", "NTA. You and Emily are not close. Her being a step sister is irrelevant. Wedding guests should want to see you and your husband happy on your wedding. Emily is trying to undermine you and divide your family. Her motives are ridiculous. Steer clear of her and the toxicity she emanates.", "NTA\n\nEven if you knew the date of the shower, a wedding and a baby shower within what? 2 to 6 weeks are not competing with each other.", "NTA she is the one being unreasonable.

The rest of our family members seemed torn, with some taking her side and others understanding my perspective.\n\nWhat family members? Who shows up for something like this? You're adults. Frankly I'm tired of pity wedding invites. The amount of $$ wasted on people no one actually wants at their wedding is part of the reason the costs are so ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nJust tell your family again:\n\n\"AFTER I announced my wedding date, she told me the planned date of her wedding shower. My sister now wants me to reschedule my wedding. I am very sad that my step sister is now badmouthing me in the family because she neither wants to have her baby shower close to our wedding nor she wants to shift the date of her shower. I hope you all understand that I won't change my wedding plans.\"", "NTA\n\nStepsister has main character syndrome. Not every decision someone else makes and everything someone else does is about her. This has absolutely nothing to do with her and does neither overshadow her baby shower, nor does it take anything away from it. Especially given how you had not been given that date prior to announcing yours. Her reaction could be understandable, if your wedding took place on the same weekend, as her babyshower. Let it even be understandable if it was only one week apart, because not all can make it to family events for two consecutive weeks in a row. With a month apart, however, she has zero grounds to be pissed and she should have announced the date of her baby shower sooner, if she wanted anyone to take it into consideration when making plans.\n\nI am surprised at the fact, that your family is torn on this, while it seems so clear-cut in your post. This hints at issues with your stepsister, that have been ongoing for some time, which is why your family likely has more context of your relationship than we do. You did not try to hide this, though, the difficuluties in your relationship with her are mentioned in the beginning. Therefore, based on what you told us, NTA.", "NTA - it blows my mind that your family is divided over her nonsense complaint.

But info... How much time does she believe is sufficient? If you move the wedding how close can you be to the birth? First year birthday party?", "NTA,\n\nYour step sister is a person who creates drama for the sake of creating drama.. it doesn't matter what date you decided on for your wedding..
