We decided to have a small, intimate ceremony with close friends and family. Among the potential guests was my stepsister, Emily (28F). We don't have a great relationship, but I didn't want to create unnecessary drama, so I intended to invite her and her husband.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue began when I shared our wedding date with the family. Emily immediately reacted negatively, saying our wedding was too close to her planned baby shower, which was scheduled for the following month. She accused me of \"stealing her thunder\" by having my wedding so close to her event.\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked by her response because we had never discussed her baby shower date, and I couldn't have known about it when we chose our wedding date. I tried to explain this, but Emily insisted that I should have somehow known and adjusted our plans to accommodate her.\r  \n\r  \nThe tension escalated when Emily called a family meeting to discuss my \"selfishness\" in planning my wedding near her baby shower. During the meeting, she accused me of being inconsiderate and trying to overshadow her life events. The rest of our family members seemed torn, with some taking her side and others understanding my perspective.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I felt like I was being treated unfairly and that Emily was making unreasonable demands. So, I made the difficult decision to not invite her to our wedding, fearing that her presence would only add stress and tension to our special day.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our family is divided, and some family members are angry at me for not inviting Emily. She continues to claim that I'm the one who's being selfish and unreasonable.

Let it even be understandable if it was only one week apart, because not all can make it to family events for two consecutive weeks in a row. With a month apart, however, she has zero grounds to be pissed and she should have announced the date of her baby shower sooner, if she wanted anyone to take it into consideration when making plans.\n\nI am surprised at the fact, that your family is torn on this, while it seems so clear-cut in your post. This hints at issues with your stepsister, that have been ongoing for some time, which is why your family likely has more context of your relationship than we do.

You selected a wedding date, which was a few weeks before her planned baby shower. How? Most people select wedding dates based on the venue. These things happen 6+ months before the wedding.

Meanwhile, you and your partner decided to make the leap, but since you are longtime partners, instead of a traditional marriage planning period, you decided to expedite the process and get married within 2 or 3 months. \n\nOf course, that is always your right. Your wedding is your day, and you aren't an asshole for wanting to get married. That said, it does put your family in a bind.
