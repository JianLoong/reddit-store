Just because a child thrives in spite of neglect doesn't mean they aren't being neglected when they more or less have to self-teach themselves on everything.\n\n>Mom said I had no right to judge her so harshly. AITA?\n\nDamn, talk about a poor deflection. You served her own ass to her on a platter and the best she can come up with is, \"that burn goes beyond your allotted character destructions for a parent miss, I'm going to have to fine you for a lack of filial piety\\~\" Sounds like she got exactly the love and support out of you that she gave first, which was basically nothing.

Good for you to not let her move in but I doubt it will be the last situation in which she tries to manipulate you to gain advantages.   \nfocus on building a strong network out of dear friends and perhaps healthy family members.\n\nand always remember, you are an adult now, therefore, you get to make your own decisions.", "NTA It doesn't sound like you judged your mother harshly enough.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
