You didn\u2019t break the friendship up because he was gay. You broke off the friendship because he pursued unwanted sexual advances after you made it clear you didn\u2019t want it to go there.", "1. He took advantage of you despite knowing you\u2019re straight. \n2. He didn\u2019t stop when you said no. \n3. He didn\u2019t apologize afterward. \n4.

It's sexual assault and don't let him convince you otherwise.   His response and name calling instead of an apology makes him an even bigger AH.", "NTA\n\nI am a cis white female.\n\nIf a male friend of mine touched me in a way I did not like and I asked to stop but he didn't, and I then take a break from my friendship with him, would that be wrong?  No.\n\nIf that male friend happened to be a different race, would my rejecting his unwanted touch make me racist?  No.\n\nIf that friend was a female friend, would that make me homophobic?  No...\n\nWe teach children that \"No means no, and it's okay to say no.\"  We also teach them that \"People who don't respect your no are not safe people and it's okay to walk away.\"  There's no difference here.\n\nIt's called body autonomy.  I have it, you have it, everyone has it.  Not wanting to be touched by someone in an overly familiar manner is just that.  Taking a step back when someone doesn't accept your no is perfectly reasonable.  Anyone who says otherwise is trying to gaslight you.", "NTA no matter sexuality boundaries are extremely important and touching anyone without their consent and accusing them of prejudice after they\u2019re upset is stupid. \n\nWould your response have changed if a straight male friend or a female friend touched you in the same way?", "NTA.\n\nYou could perhaps explain away Mike's initial touch as a clumsy pass that you rejected. He continued touching, which puts him firmly in sexual assault territory. It's not homophobic to object to being sexually assaulted.", "NTA. You weren't being homophobic. You were setting a reasonable boundary. It's actually gross that your friend would call you homophobic when the real problem was that he disrespected you and touched you in a sexual manner without your consent. Your friend is an abuser and should be avoided. A real friend doesn't sexually molest you and try to turn the tables on you when they are so clearly the one in the wrong.", "NTA. Sweets, you weren't homophobic, you were uncomfortable with his sexual advances.", "NTA he touched you when you expressed you were uncomfortable and no consent was given. you\u2019re not homophobic and he is fucking disgusting for claiming you are. rejecting someone\u2019s advances when you\u2019re not attracted to them does not make you an asshole or homophobic. tell your friend he\u2019s a dick and cut contact. he assaulted you.", "Absolutely NTA.

That's not homophobic, that's having respect for your own bodily autonomy.", "NTA. Mike sexually assaulted you. He is gaslighting you by calling you homophobic for exercising your bodily autonomy. It\u2019s not homophobic to turn someone down or tell them no. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your friend violated you and your trust that way.

Mike violated them and refused to stop or take no for an answer.  This has nothing to do with sexual orientation and everything to do with consent.  It sounds like you were assaulted.

NO ONE deserves to be subject to unwanted advances. NO ONE has the right to cross boundaries regardless of sexual orientation. I would give your friend some space to come to his senses. Hopefully he does.", "NTA if anyone makes unwanted advances on you they are in the wrong and he did. His sexuality isn't even the issue here but since he wants to go down that road he's making other gay men look bad like they are predators when they aren't. Or on a biological level he's reinforcing the stereotype that men can't control themselves when that's not true either. He's an asshole for coming onto you after you made it clear you weren't interested. He's an even bigger asshole for making it a sexuality thing when he's just butt hurt that he was rejected. It's not a sexuality issue it's a boundary issue and you can decide whatever you want after having your boundary crossed.", "NTA - He's the asshole.", "NTA.\n\nBeing upset with unwanted contact is not \"Homophobic\".", "NTA no touchie", "NTA.

That creates emotions, combine that with some drinks and he went where he shouldn't have. and I say this as a very grounded gay man.\n\nI agree with your message about boundaries, but to say immediately you want a break from your friendship is a bit over the top maybe.

After you told him no, he tried even more which means you get the fuck out. Those kind of situations are what cause worst ones to happen if they are not cut off early, I can attest to that. It's not worth the risk, no matter what the friendship is. The fact that they refuse to apologize and then throw it back on you shows that they know what they did was wrong and way out of line. \n\nI would even recommend that if you have a therapist that you discuss this with them.

I don\u2019t think so, the same rules apply here and he needs to get his thinking right, he was wrong, acted inappropriately and needs to apologize.  I would definitely go LC with him", "Seriously this. Kind of aghast that someone would try to give a pass to the first time. If you don't know that they will appreciate it don't touch someone like that at all?? \n\nThere's this absurdly selfish mentality I see sometimes that people think that making a 'pass' needs to get excused so people can 'shoot their shot' or whatever and I hate it. It shows so little respect for the other person involved"]}
