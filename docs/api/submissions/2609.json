You were setting a reasonable boundary. It's actually gross that your friend would call you homophobic when the real problem was that he disrespected you and touched you in a sexual manner without your consent.

No, the 'friend' is predatory, using OPs drunkenness to push OPs boundary, which is assault.\n\nWould you walk up to someone you DID know and do the first 2 things, without discussing it? If yes, you need to rethink what you think is acceptable. Find the consent in those situations and if it comes after badgering or without talking about it, that's coercion at the least and assault at worst.", "What is obvious disinterest to a sober person can become less obvious to a person who has been drinking, as was the case here.\n\nAnd I think the context of the kiss matters. If someone leans in for a kiss and I slightly dodge it which results in me getting a kiss on my cheek, that is different than someone forcibly kissing another person on the lips and shoving their tongue in the unwilling person's mouth. Neither are okay but one is clearly worse.", "Nope. If you can't tell if someone is interested or not then you shouldn't pursue. There's a reason being drunk takes away consent legally.\n\nBoth of your examples are unwanted physical touch and assault."]}
