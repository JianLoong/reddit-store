She is the first woman I ever dated, loved and brought home. No one expected us to last given how different we are but we got married and we have a two year old daughter.\n\nMy sister Amber (29F) has been with her husband David (32M) for 9 years, married for 5. They also have 2 year old twins. Both my parents adore David. My mom (58F) absolutely loves him. \n\nShe keeps complimenting him, offering to help him with kids, and gets him expensive gifts. I also like David a lot and I think he is a wonderful person who deserves all that and more.\n\nHowever, my parents and even Amber act very cold towards Charlotte. They ignore her existence sometimes and it seems only tolerate her presence out of obligation. We have had many arguments about this, but it still happens sometimes.\n\nMom threw a huge Birthday party for David this year. He has been in all of our lives for long. I understand mom not wanting to do the exact same thing for Charlotte. My issue is, Charlotte didn't even get a call from mom until it was 3 days after her actual birthday. That kind of got on my nerves.\n\nI called mom and asked to meet up and mentioned how she was so different towards Charlotte and David. Her first excuse was because David and Amber can't afford to buy nice presents while Charlotte easily can.\n\nI asked her why she treated them so differently. She said it was because Charlotte is naturally a serious and intimidating person and she just feels more comfortable with David and how kind and warm he is. \n\nI told mom her wishing Charlotte a happy birthday has nothing to do with that. That I don't expect her to treat them the exact same way I just want her to start treating my wife like a normal person. She called me jealous and judgemental, and said that I just needed to accept that David was closer to our family because he was with Amber for such a long time.\n\nI may be TA here because I may have overreacted with how emotional I was. I told mom I could give her even more space for her to be around people she felt comfortable with and left her at the restaurant. I haven't picked up her calls or answered her messages since none of them are apologetic and she is accusing me of acting spoiled and entitled.\n\nAmber called me and said I was overreacting by a mile.

They're not even giving your wife a chance, that's unfair.\n\nEdit: OH MY GOD I JUST REALIZED YOU'RE TWO WOMEN. Maybe that's why? Don't you think they're homophobes and that's why your couple is treated differently than your sister's couple?\n\nHonestly if it's that, just go NC, you don't deserve to be treated like that because you're married to a woman.", "NTA. I would be pissed if my husband wasn't treated like a part of my family. That's what it comes down to. Your family is not accepting of your wife, and that's bullshit.", "NTA. It's probably very obvious that your family approves your BIL but doesn't approve your wife. Because she is woman, first of all.", "NTA and you\u2019re right that giving a courtesy call for Charlotte\u2019s birthday has nothing to do with her perceived demeanor.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re giving the whole story here, it seems odd that they\u2019d treat her so differently. From what you\u2019ve written at least, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve U-Hauled it or anything that would make your family suspicious of the stability of the relationship, etc. although you mentioned no one thinking you two would last because you\u2019re very different, so i wonder if there\u2019s more to the story there. \n\nYou mentioned Charlotte being able to afford nice things - could jealousy or some other financial aspect be coming into play? And how did your mom react to you coming out - are we sure there\u2019s no undercurrent of potential homophobia? And honestly, some peoples\u2019 personalities just don\u2019t mesh. \n\nEither way it sounds like there\u2019s something under the surface here that maybe your mom isn\u2019t being forthcoming about. But regardless of what it is or isn\u2019t, you can just stand up and defend your wife here as it seems you\u2019ve been doing.", "NTA.  Sounds like they\u2019re too scared to admit they\u2019re homophobes.", "NTA. She really expects you to believe it\u2019s okay to not call until 3 days later?  I\u2019m concerned that you even posted this.  You and your wife deserve the same decency they give others.", "NTA. Honestly I\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve never brought it up to your mom before.  Clearly she is homophobic.", "NTA there is obvious favoritism. I hate saying this but there may be a certain bias\u2026", "NTA\n\nFirst, your mother sounds like a homophone. \n\nSecond, your sister loves being the recipient of all the focus, attention, gifts, etc. \n\nYou\u2019re right to stick up for your wife.", "NTA seems like it might be because of lowkey homophobia. She also might be telling the truth and she likes him and his personality more. You may never know but it doesn\u2019t really matter. Just remind your wife how much you love her and spoil her any way you can.", "NTA at all. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s blatant homophobia (which is the obvious conclusion) or just a huge personality clash, but either way your mother and sister are incredibly rude", "NTA. Your mom has a nasty personality and I see your sister inherited it, glad it skipped you. You guys shouldn\u2019t have to grin and bear it when your family is outright disregarding your wife.", "NTA sounds like your mother is homophobia. It sad but your mother will give your wife a cold treatment like this forever.", "NTA. Your mother is a homophob who really wanted a second son-in-law, and since you hadn't delivered, has been passive aggressively punishing you.", "NTA. They're playing favorites here and not treating your wife like she's part of the family by giving her the cold shoulder. I'm not sure if it has to do with the fact they might be homophobes or something completely different. Just because David was here longer than your wife, like your mom said, doesn't mean they can treat her like she doesn't exist or her feelings don't matter. You wasn't being judgemental or jealous, you were sticking up for your wife. Maybe try going low contact/no contact from your family. This behavior is unacceptable.", "Could it be that they just don't like her at all? That her personality clashes with your family? \n\nHonestly, we all have read about DILs that Mothers hate and others In-laws they love. \n\nHave you talked to your wife about how the interactions with her and your family go?\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t think getting the exact same treatment is necessarily reasonable as people bond with who they bond with.  Their relationship may have started because of the marriage but seems to also stand on its own where that doesn\u2019t exist with Chloe.  So it\u2019s good to recognize that.\n\nBut there should be a solid level of consideration out of respect for you/family bonds and if sounds like they aren\u2019t meeting.  I think you need to be constructive though on what does.  \n\n\u201cJust treating her like a person\u201d- how many people do you call on their birthdays?  Everyone you know?  Or just the ones personally close to?  Every family member?  Does everyone in family?  She sounds like she is treating her as a person, nothing derogatory, it\u2019s just not on the personal level you wish.  Unfortunately that\u2019s hard to force/fake and is a two way street", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe your mom was telling the truth. Maybe Charlotte is intimidating. Is there any truth to this? I'm torn here. What you're asking isn't unreasonable it's just that some people gel with some more than others. I guess my response comes from me thinking of certain people that intimidate me and I avoid them sometimes when I'm feeling insecure. Just throwing it out there.", "It's really hard to tell without some more info here, but I imagine ignoring anything that isn't apologetic is not going to get you far toward working this out.  Asking wasn't the asshole move, but the way you handled her response was definitely counterproductive to what I assume you were hoping for.( A closer relationship between your spouse and parent? Correct me if I'm wrong here.)\n\nOn the surface, it's easy to chalk this up to homophobia ( which it may very well be) but you heard it directly from your mother: she finds your wife intimidating for reasons up to and including the fact that she is able to provide for herself. Try to have a calm and constructive conversation on that.\n\nSoft ESH for now.", "NTA.  Tell your sister.  You are tired of their behavior.  Tired of them mistreating your spouse.  And you are distancing yourself.  That she is now on the list.  If she wants to get a message to you.  Have David call.  Since he is actually kind.", "Came here for this. It sounds like she may be homophobic. Has she treated you differently or more distant since you got with Charlotte?", "I suspect that, even if the family has appeared to be accepting of *OP*, deep down they are homophobic and perhaps blame Charlotte for \"seducing\" OP, since Charlotte is the first woman she had a relationship with.", "INFO: what do you mean by \"no one expected us to last given how different we are\"?", "NTA. All your point are valid and I don't think you are overreacting. Have you considered that the way your mother treats David has more to do with you and your partner rather than what she actually thinks of David?\n\nIt seems she is \"parenting\" by rewarding \"good\" behavior (being in a straight relationship and punishing \"bad\" behavior (being in a same sex relationship). She wants to show you specifically how good she would treat your partner if she was a man. \n\nWhy else would she go out of her way to throw a party for her SIL then deliberately shun and ignore her DIL? I think you need to have a deeper discussion with your mother. She might be under the assumption that being gay is a choice and that you might change your mind by her acting lile this. She might be harboring resentment towards your partner. Blaming her for your sexual orientation.", "NTA. Theyre most likely homophobic but know if theyre blatant you will cut contact", "NTA\nBut don\u2019t dig too deep as the answer is unlikely to make you happy", "Good on you for standing up for your wife.

Isn\u2019t space what she wanted?", "News flash, as David joined the family first  he will ALWAYS have been there longer. \n\nThis is not an excuse. Your family is homophobic and 100% the AH. \n\nYou are NTA ... cut them off and go live your joy.", "Sorry but they don't sound like they will ever except her or even try to as long as your happy enjoy your little family and let them get on with the hero worship of bil one day theh will realise what they have lost", "I missed the genders on this and my first thought was \"Is Charlotte a different race?\""]}
