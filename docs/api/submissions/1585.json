Usually before I shower, I ask him if he needs to use the toilet since sometimes my shower routine can be long (up to 30 minutes). \n\nLast night, my boyfriend was eating the snack I\u2019d made him on the couch. I went to use the toilet and while in the bathroom, decided to also take a quick (10 min) shower. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t think to ask my boyfriend if he needed the toilet first- I figured it would be quick, he was eating, I don\u2019t know. \n\nA couple minutes into the shower, he knocks on the door saying he has to pee really bad. I ask him if he needs to go immediately and he says yes. I rush out of the shower, covered in soap, and he is just sitting on the couch and doesn\u2019t get up when I come out of the bathroom. I\u2019m not angry, but given I just rushed out of the shower and am eager to get back in, I am a little annoyed he doesn\u2019t seem to need the bathroom as urgently as he claims. I say \u201cdon\u2019t you need to go pee?\u201d And he says, \u201cwhy do you have such a bad attitude? It\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t give me a chance to pee first.\u201d I say sorry and ask if he can hop to it because I want to continue my shower.\n\nWhen I come out to sit on the couch with him once I am done showering, he is very angry with me. He says I was narcissistic to not give him a chance to pee before I showered, then I was narcissistic to get angry at him for needing to pee. I told him I wasn\u2019t angry, just a little thrown off, but I am now upset that I\u2019m essentially in trouble for what seems like a minor incident\u2026 he ultimately peed and I ultimately showered, so where is the problem?\n\nWe went to bed without resolving this and today he is still upset with me. He says I\u2019m selfish for what I did last night and is further upset with me for feeling like he is being mean about the situation. \n\nLast night I felt like he was being crazy but today I am wondering if I am in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR- boyfriend is mad at me for not giving him a chance to pee before I showered and being less than thrilled at having my shower interrupted for a seemingly non-urgent pee.

Oh wait\u2026..", "NTA\n\nHe could have held it.\n\nHe could have peed with you in the shower.\n\nHe could have used a sink or some other dispenser if he was absolutely desperate and you weren't coming out quick enough. Okay it's not a great situation, but if it was truly an emergency, he would have done.\n\nInstead he... sat back down on the couch and then had a go at you for not asking an adult man if he could hold his pee for 10 minutes?!\n\nNow he's angry, and you're the narcissist and the selfish one. Yeah, funny thing is, narcissists often accuse others around them like that. Have a good think about any other situations where he's done stuff like this.", "NTA. And he couldn\u2019t pee while you were in the shower because\u2026?", "It sounds like you did something very minorly inconsiderate and immediately took action when he said it was inconveniencing him. and then he turned his response up to 11.

NTA.", "NTA: It's not your responsibility to make sure he pees before you use the shower in your own home. He is an adult and can learn to wait.\n\nMajor note here: He is gaslighting you hard. You are not the narc, he is, and he is making you feel like the bad guy for something that isn't an issue.\n\nYou. Do not. Have to ask. If he needs a pee. Before your shower. It's considerate and kind of you to think of him, but it's ***NOT*** a necessity. \n\nFFS men take pride in whizzing in the back yard. The dude is manipulating and controlling you. You don't deserve this treatment one bit.", "Info, why can't he just pee while you are in the shower?", "NTA. Most people can wait 10 minutes to pee. If he could not wait, he could have went into the bathroom and went pee while you are showering. It sounds like he was TRYING to pick a fight with you. I feel like there is something else going on here. Is it possible he was angry about something else he did not want to talk about so he picked a fight over this?", "1. Your boyfriend does not know what narcissist means\n2. Your boyfriend is quite the drama queen\n3. Your boyfriend seems a bit controlling\n\nNTA Why can't he pee while you're in the shower? Not that that will solve any of the above problems.", "Why did you have to get out of the shower while he peed, though?", "NTA.  First, why did you have to stop mid shower for him to pee?  Second, I don't think he knows what the word narcissistic means.", "Unless he\u2019s peeing in the shower, I don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t duck in and use the toilet while you\u2019re showering?  Having you get out of the shower and leave the room is weird and excessive. Also, if he can\u2019t hold a pee for 10 minutes, he should probably talk to a urologist. \n\nOne question, though. Does he accuse you of being selfish about other small, minor matters? Does he hold onto grudges like this often? Does he make you feel crazy for no reason? Because if so, then I would reconsider what your future with your boyfriend looks like. You should be able to take 10 minutes to shower without being made to feel bad about it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou've been together with him for several years and he can't pee while you're in the shower?", "I\u2019m confused. Why can\u2019t he pee if you\u2019re in the shower? \nBeen married 17 years. Door is closed when I\u2019m showering but he can come in, pee really quickly and leave.

Why the urgency.. and then y the attitude towards you about it??? Calling you a narcissistic for not asking him if he needed to pee??? I mean I ask my SO if I think about it and vice versa, but if we really gotta go we just go in while the other ones in the shower... or wait.... \n\nAgain NTA", "Why do you need to leave the room?

The kind where the whole room is the shower? I\u2019ve seen them in Europe a few places. The toilet paper has to be in a shielded container to keep from getting wet. Is that the kind we\u2019re dealing with here? \n\nI ask because unless you\u2019re showering on the toilet, why can\u2019t he come in and use the toilet? Oh! Is he a shy pisser? Some people just can run the faucet while they\u2019re with somebody.", "NTA - your boyfriend is a moron.", "So taking a shower is narcissistic? Wow. Projection... a classic narcissist move.   Call the other guy a narcissist before they have a chance to see that they're looking at a narcissist.\n\nHe pulls you out of the shower because he has to pee, and then doesn't pee. Did he really have to go so bad that he couldn't wait til you got out on your own? Sounds like he's all about control. \n\nHe's gaslighting you. All you did was hop in the shower while he stuffed his face with a snack YOU made for him. I'll bet you're the one who does all the cooking and cleaning too, am I right?\n\nDo yourself a favor... don't get pregnant. Life with this guy sounds awful. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  But you might want to do something about that boyfriend problem.", "NTA - What if you'd just been in there because you were constipated? 10 mins isn't that long to shower. Honestly best thing is to just get to where yall can pee if the other is in the shower. It's not like you can hear it over the shower.", "NTA, it's considerate that you ask if he has to go before you take your longer showers but that doesn't mean that you're obligated to \"warn\" him literally every time you're going to be in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes. You also did the right thing of leaving the shower when he \"urgently\" had to pee - sometimes those situations happen in a 1 bathroom household. \n\nBut if your bf really \"urgently\" had to go, he wouldn't have been sitting on the couch and making you wait while still wet - I think he might have been trying to *punish* you for daring to take a shower without warning him? And immediately throwing \"narcissist\" around and calling you selfish for what should have been a simple, no-conflict interaction is worrying. Does he normally act entitled to shared household resources? Does he \"punish\" you for perceived slights? Does he call you a narcissist a lot?", "Nta I don\u2019t ask anyone if they gotta use the bathroom only kids. He heard the water running then the shower coming on. He had all the time in the world b4 yu went also", "INFO\n\nHow can you be in a long term relationship with a guy and he is unable to pee while you are showering? \n\nWhile most people want privacy when they defecate, peeing - especially for a guy - is not a really \"personal\" private thing as they whip it out at urinals and it is pretty discreet. You are behind a shower curtain and presumably can't see him - not that it matters.", "I'm not sure why you had to come out of the bathroom at all leave the door unlocked and if he has to pee he can come in and pee. \n\nAnd if for some reason this isn't possible you MUST always offer the bathroom to him before you shower. Anything else is rude imo", "I just looked at OP's comment history.  This issue is mild compared to other posts.  OP, this is the Universe speaking.  You have permission to let go of this.  Just let go and walk away.  Aren't you tired of going around in circles every day with him?  You can be free.  Stop going in circles and keep going.

NTA at all, I understand he would need privacy for number 2 but for a quick wee?? No offence but he seems quite insecure, and what a disdainful thing to say you're narcissistic.. His reaction is incredibly uncalled for.", "NTA. This doesn't make sense to me. He has no right to get all pissed because you didn't ask him if he needed to go potty before you took a shower. He's being a little petty. I also don't understand why he couldn't just pee while you were in there and then get out... But even if he couldn't he definitely has no reason to be pissed off at you. It's not like you know his mind or body. Sometimes it's just easier to get a shower when you're already in there.... And he held it anyway so clearly he was fine.

Yeah, it's common courtesy to ask if someone needs to use the bathroom before showering, but sometimes it can slip your mind. You didn't do it with any sort of malicious intent; you just simply forgot to ask. It happens. But for him to call you narcissistic and selfish for a simple mistake that, all things considered, was easily remedied is just insane to me.

You might need a better boyfriend though.", "NTA - It doesn\u2019t seem like he needed to pee. More like he wants some level of control over your actions.

My husband know not to bother me in the shower I mean the water is hot enough to peal skin so there is so much steam he doesn\u2019t like to come in. But he gets it. He needs to get over it.

I don\u2019t see a long term future for you two.", "Omg is he always this exhausting to be around??? Like you live together, are intimate together (?) and he can\u2019t pee while you\u2019re in the shower? He is gaslighting the f**k out of you to for absolutely no reason.

Though, based on your post history, this feels like projection.....\n\nIdk if it's your bf you're talking about in all of your posts about narcissism, but it not you might have a second narcissist on your hands.

Does he do things like this often?", "This is whole situation sounds extremely childish. It\u2019s weird that this was even a conflict at all.

Usually before I shower, I ask him if he needs to use the toilet since sometimes my shower routine can be long (up to 30 minutes). \n\nLast night, my boyfriend was eating the snack I\u2019d made him on the couch. I went to use the toilet and while in the bathroom, decided to also take a quick (10 min) shower. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t think to ask my boyfriend if he needed the toilet first- I figured it would be quick, he was eating, I don\u2019t know. \n\nA couple minutes into the shower, he knocks on the door saying he has to pee really bad. I ask him if he needs to go immediately and he says yes. I rush out of the shower, covered in soap, and he is just sitting on the couch and doesn\u2019t get up when I come out of the bathroom. I\u2019m not angry, but given I just rushed out of the shower and am eager to get back in, I am a little annoyed he doesn\u2019t seem to need the bathroom as urgently as he claims. I say \u201cdon\u2019t you need to go pee?\u201d And he says, \u201cwhy do you have such a bad attitude? It\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t give me a chance to pee first.\u201d I say sorry and ask if he can hop to it because I want to continue my shower.\n\nWhen I come out to sit on the couch with him once I am done showering, he is very angry with me. He says I was narcissistic to not give him a chance to pee before I showered, then I was narcissistic to get angry at him for needing to pee. I told him I wasn\u2019t angry, just a little thrown off, but I am now upset that I\u2019m essentially in trouble for what seems like a minor incident\u2026 he ultimately peed and I ultimately showered, so where is the problem?\n\nWe went to bed without resolving this and today he is still upset with me. He says I\u2019m selfish for what I did last night and is further upset with me for feeling like he is being mean about the situation. \n\nLast night I felt like he was being crazy but today I am wondering if I am in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR- boyfriend is mad at me for not giving him a chance to pee before I showered and being less than thrilled at having my shower interrupted for a seemingly non-urgent pee. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "nta he sounds like a child lol", "NTA, but he is.\n\nI don't understand why he can't hold it for 10 min (or even 30) while you shower, or why he couldn't just come in, pee, and go back out of the bathroom.", "Mehh....\nI shit while hubby is in the shower, and vice versa.\nNo closed door rules..", "INFO: do not all couples pee when the other is in the shower?", "Me and my ex used to washroom same time he's peeing or pooping I'm taking a shower , isn't how it works or was I doing it wrong . Let me knw maybe that's why we're getting a divorce if u are a couple it's not that way with everyone else.", "okay NTA but like stop being his mommy and also ??? he could\u2019ve peed while you were in the shower and it could\u2019ve been a non issue ???", "He can pee in the kitchen sink if it's really that bad. He can get out of the building and pee outside. He is gaslighting you sooooooo hard rn. You not thinking about him only every second of your day means you are a narcissist. Homie doesn't even know the sens of the word ffs!", "NTA. There is definitely a narcissist in your relationship but it ain\u2019t you.", "NTA... he can pee while you are in the shower...", "Wtf why can't he pee with you in the shower? You guys see each other naked right? So weird.  Esh", "ESH honestly. How on earth can you live with someone, fart beside him, lick his saliva, and have a\\*al intercourse but you cannot have him pee when u shower? Beyond weird to me. You are both little drama queens.", "ESH, what's the big deal about him taking a piss while you shower, you live together, you presumably have seen each other naked.", "Sorry for hijacking this comment\n\nINFO: is he an infant? You made him a snack and forgot to ask him if he needed to go. He can hold it 10 minutes, he can pee while you shower, he can pee outside. You came out of your shower for him and yet he threw a tantrum. \n\nNTA but your boyfriend sounds insufferable", "Gotta admit, you had me at first. Well done. \n\nMay want to add your judgement, though.", "You win the comments! Spot on!!", "Yea I had to go back and reread because I thought this was a single mom to a toddler for a second. Reddit makes me happy I\u2019m single.", ">He could have peed with you in the shower.\n\nI swear I read this as \"He could have joined you in the shower and you pee together\". I mean, this would also be an option..", "Yes!  He didnt have to pee.  He was mad at you bc you didnt check with him about whether he needed to pee before you hopped in the shower.  He is a controlling arse.  Weigh this relationship very carefully and whether it is worth continuing it.\n\nNTA", "Yes, hugely disproportionate to the minor offense. Seems like he was going out of his way to put her in her place.", "Punishing someone for not asking if they need to go potty who doesn't even need to go, that's narcissistic behavior.\n\nNTA but op needs to leave because if he isn't a narcissist, this behavior is not right.", "Agreed. Poor OP is blind to his manipulative behavior because she appears to have a good heart. I hope comments like yours are a wakeup call.", "I\u2019ll check before I have an hour and a half bath if anyone needs a shit but other than that\u2026 my god. This guy is a real piece of work.", "A woman I work with said she's never once peed in front of her husband so I guess some couples don't do that. Weird, but probably they just need an opaque shower curtain to give a little extra privacy.  Or a second bathroom.", "glad i wasn't the only one who immediately wondered this.", "I have been with my husband for almost 23 years and have never peed in front of him and he has never peed in front of me. However, when we finally bought a house we made sure the master bathroom has a toilet blocked off by a wall so either of us could pee when the other was in the shower. \n\nIt\u2019s weird to some but my husband didn\u2019t grow up with a big family coming and going from the bathroom regardless of what was happening and I respect him enough to hold that boundary. It feels very normal now.", "If he had to go so bad that he had to go immediately, then he would have had a strong urge 10 minutes ago. If that was the case (which is was not as he was relaxed on the couch), he should have felt the need to go before OP even went in the bathroom.\n\nI can understand barging in if it was a true emergency, but it wasn't, as seen by his not running into the bathroom immediately.\n\nOP is NTA, but the boyfriend is.", "I straight up refuse to ever be in the room while my SO shits. It's a hard line for me. I would get out of the shower for that.\n\nBut peeing doesn't smell...", "Yeah, we have one bathroom and some things just can\u2019t wait.", "She'd have to put up with the smell \ud83e\udd23 ewwwww. If it's nearly bedtime or we've just got up well use the other bathroom so we don't have to shower and brush our teeth in the funk", "This.", "Yeah, everything should be fine so long as you don't cross the streams.", "This is what I thought of first. He did it to be spiteful.", "idk my boyfriend literally cannot pee if hes not alone", "Does flushing while someone is showering mess up the water pressure or something? I've seen multiple people say similar things.", "Public urination can get you slapped with criminal charges and in some places those charges are enough to get you put on the sex offenders registry.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This is not a relationship where she is recorded and treated as an equal.", "I'm confused that a man she lives with can't pee while she's taking a shower, even with the curtain closed so she doesn't actually see his you-know-what and she has to leave because why?! \n\nNot that I want to think about it too hard, but I'm assuming they are intimate and she sees his little guy then? Or does she have to close her eyes because it's icky if she sees it? \n\nClearly, he made her get out of the shower just to be a d\\*ck. \n\nNTA and agree on the insufferable part.", "And he called *her* a narcissist! *WHAT?!* You know who does things like that? People who either hear it as a buzzword and have no idea what an actual narcissist is, or someone with narcissistic tendencies themselves, who are projecting.", "Apparently she can make a snack on the couch, so that doesn't sound too weird. \ud83d\ude09", "You can have sex with someone but can't pee in front of them? \n\nI don't understand this mentality.", "My husband and I had unspeakable shits infront of eachother early into our relationship. His when when I was taking a bubble bath after a long day at work and he just about destroyed the toilet. Mine was in the middle of a date when he took me to an Indian restaurant (my first ever) and I wanted to impress him by ordering a spicy dish.", "I'm a big fan of flower shower curtains.", "Depending on the water system, the toilet being flushed can divert the cold water away from the shower and make the shower water extra hot.", "People who do this are just wrong. My petty spiteful ass would never give him warning about going for a shower again, and if he claims to be desperate halfway through my shower then he can either hold it, wet himself, or use the sink if he can't pee in front of me.", "It\u2019s not so much the pressure but the temperature. Toilets generally only use cold water so if you\u2019re using the shower and someone flushes, the cold water is replaced with scalding hot water. Pretty bad burns can happen as a result.", "Depends. In our current apartment, flushing has literally no effect on any aspect of showering.", "It sounds like he's a narcissist and he's flipping the script. His behavior is so weird and manipulative.", "We are a one bathroom household. I have ibs, you learn to get over it quickly in times of need. I ran into the house once while my boyfriend in the shower, after a few minutes of banging on the door and cries of desperation, we both knew what needed to be done.", "Right?! I had a standing agreement with my best friend when we were roommates if someone needed and pee and the other was in the shower we\u2019d just knock and wait for the ok to be given and go in and pee. We always had mostly opaque shower curtains so one could shower and the other could pee or do makeup or whatever.", "Dude it all comes done to comfort there a lot of different things factoring into two very different activities. Some people just like having private space while showering.", "My partner and I have mini hang outs when either of us go, some times for support. It\u2019s not weird unless you make it so", "XD yee boi.  The best partners are the ones that have been together in front of the worst things.", "If it\u2019s just pee, close the lid and flush once the shower is done.", "In my house it's slightly different. If something else starts using a lot of water (such as flushing the toilet, running a tap in the kitchen) the shower runs cold until it's done. Not dangerous but still a very unpleasant surprise.", "That's what they do, I lived with one for 12 years but even he wasn't this bad.", ">we both knew what needed to be done.\n\nAs a fellow IBS haver, lol. \ud83d\udc9a", "I just moved in with a new roommate a little over a month ago, we didn't know each other at all prior to moving in. We're pretty much at the point now where we're ok with peeing in front of each other. Having one bathroom with multiple people is a pain and when you gotta go you gotta go \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You know what they say: \u201cif you\u2019ve seen eachother shit your brains out and you still wanna have sex, it\u2019s true love.\u201d", "It's so bad lol. When we go out to the mall and eat (I also have anxiety, makes it worse) and walk around at some point I turn around and go \"we need to find a bathroom...NOW\" and proceed to speed bathroom waddle to the bathroom, he thinks it's adorable, find someone who loves your panicked bathroom waddle \ud83d\udc97", "I lived with my best friend and another roommate for a while and best friend and I would only lock the bathroom door if there were guest over and we\u2019d pee and shower at the same time but the other roommate who would walk around the apartment nearly nude and was that reason of the \u201cyou must have your crotch and butt covered in the kitchen and sitting on any communal furniture\u201d was uncomfortable both with having someone pee when she showered and peeing when someone else showered. It was so odd. She also didn\u2019t unlock the bathroom door when she left the bathroom so a few times the breeze from the bathroom window closed the bathroom door and it was locked with no one in there"]}
