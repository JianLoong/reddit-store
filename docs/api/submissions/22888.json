It's not 'normal', you're not weak, and you don't have a low pain tolerance. If it's not being addressed effectively, it's not a reflection of you, it's inadequate medical education and a crappy system.", "NTA. i understand how embarrassing and stressful a heavy bleed in public can be especially when you can\u2019t get in front of it in time to prevent [visible] accidents. that was my life before getting on birth control. however, it\u2019s not your fault that that bathroom was the most accessible to you in the moment. i hope you\u2019re doing okay, and glad you came prepared with a change of clothes. respect. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA\n\nI have PCOS and sometimes it's sudden and unmanageable if I don't do something right now!

Even if you saw it, by the time you would run upstairs, dracula would already be chasing after you for all the blood leak you'd be having... But, supposing you knew which bathroom it was, you could have asked someone for permission, but again: you said you *didn't* know that it was *staff only* bathroom... It doesn't make you an AH, it makes you a person who didn't see a sign on a door.\n\n**The security lady is not the AH either -** She might know what you were going through, and even empathize with you and understand it, but she is working and maybe can't show it since she might be being watched... Notice her first phrase to you *\"Did someone stop you from going inside that bathroom?\"* \u2014 this can be an indication that her superiors saw it happening and tried to check if their employees were working properly (in that case: trying to stop you = working properly), and even if she understands your side, sometimes security people have cameras and mics on their uniform, and they must act \"bluntly\" and \"objectively\"...\n\nI know it sucks, but seeing through the office people eye's lens: they don't have all that information... All they saw was:\n\n1. a random person entering somewhere they weren't supposed to enter, and \n2. that their employees who were supposed to stop random people from doing X things, not doing what they were supposed to be doing.\n\nThese people would take an hour or so to explain the occurrence to their boss, and sometimes bosses aren't that comprehensive... \n\nI worked at a pharmacy and we were supposed to not allow costumers in staff's bathroom... I got threatened a lot of times while there just for obeying my boss and holding my job (I'm living in a very violent town), but the thing is: there were camera's fvcking everywhere! E v e r y w h e r e! My boss knew what colour my shoes were just by looking at the camera! They knew what money bill the costumer paid with, because there were 3 cameras on the checkout desk! \n\nI also worked on a pub, and when queer people wanted to use the bathroom for the other gender they weren't assigned at birth, and they came to ask me if they could use it, I would blink an eye and say 'You didn't speak to me, and I didn't hear anything. And you better do it while I'm not facing the bathroom direction and people can clearly see that I'm doing something far away from the bathroom sight', then turn my head around, pretend I'm busy to give them time to enter the bathroom they wanted to, and then be it. And then, I would hope they wouldn't snitch me for helping them if they ever got caught! Bcus some people don't understand that as a costumer they are way more protected than the person in an employee position...\n\nI know it all sucks, but thing is: employees are trying to hold jobs! And sometimes we can try doing something, other times we are way more limited... I know, it sucks, it completely sucks! Some things are also dependent on luck...\n\nSo the security chick wasn't an AH (although she could blink her eye to give you a sign, but this is too risky! You could say \"What? What are you trying to say?\" in a very genuine way to understand what is happening, but still, that would be proof she was trying to avoid doing something she was paid to), as for the reasons I've listed here;\n\nAnd you aren't an AH either. You were in an emergency, and according to your words: you didn't see the sign or board at the door... These things happen....\n\nSo: No AHs here.", "YTA.

You can then tell me \"Oh, you can handle a lash out\", to which I can answer: what if the costumer starts throwing things at you? You can't defend yourself properly without being blamed (because you are in *worker position* whereas they are in *costumer position*) and risk losing your job...\n\nAnd then you can say \"Not every costumer will do this\", to which I can reply: depends on where you live. And it can get even worse! Some people will keep watching you daily because of a mere day where you stopped them from using the staff's bathroom, and they will know your routine and what time you leave, they will follow you home, and you guess what happens. Hint: it's in the community rules to no mention forms of violence, thus, I won't mention it.\n\nIt's really like throwing a penny in the wind and waiting for it to land on your hand with the good side facing up. But the thing is: this penny has been tossed in air so many times, and most of the times it has landed with the bad side on.\n\nAnd worst of it all: bosses are not that comprehensive. Even if she told you the costumer exactly what you said, and everything was flowery and rainbowish, and fluffy little perfect world, and the costumer totally understood it, she can return to her station only to have her boss yell at her telling things like \"I TOLD YOU TO BE MORE FIRM!

But in the delusional mind of her boss, it's her job to be the security person AND the lock of the bathroom. \n\nI agree some people are pretentious, and they work in costumer service doing a very shitty service bcus they are bored teenagers being forced by parents to \"grow some maturity\", or just because they don't take things seriously, or any other factors...

Either you let people harass you or you are doomed... Can you imagine a situation like that? NO! BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU! IT HAPPENED TO ME!

Imagine the times you have been treated like shit for being traumatized.\n\nI find grocery shopping very dissociating BC of many different reasons, and the more dissociated I am, the more likely I am going to be hassled by staff who think I'm stealing when I'm just not present at all iny head.\n\nI had a rude as fuck customer who kept doing things like coming into our back room and was very very needy. I really disliked her. Then she said that she used to shop with her mum who recently passed away. And it clicked, and now I'm super nice to her.\n\nYou do not have to have the capability to control your trauma, but let's not pretend that empathy isn't  something that helps the world and we shouldnt expect it from others.\n\nYou acting how you would act could make me spiral for weeks and end up in a freeze response or lose weeks or months. \n\n\nI get why you act that way. But it's a two way street", "[deleted]", "I'm going to probably be downvoted, but ESH. Look, I worked at a mall with a staff only restroom. I would have a small window of time to go to the restroom before I had to go back on shift. If I missed it because someone was in the restroom, I might not be able to go again until I got home after the mall closed. And there was always a line for the womens restroom so I wouldn't be able to wait. I would be doing the potty dance, and one time, I peed myself because I didn't get to go to the restroom. It was a bad day all around. \n\nI understand it is an emergency. I do not want to discredit that, and I am glad you have extra undies and pants. The guard was an ahole because emergencies do happen.", "Ok, how can you not notice the sign yet you did know where the bathroom was?\n\nYou read it on the door and choose to ignore the most important part \"staff only\" because to you wasn't a big deal", "Imagine being angry at someone for trying to clean up their period like wtf, would she have preferred you bled on the floor?? Some people \ud83d\ude44", "NTA- here in the UK we have something called a \"can't wait\" card which is used for IBD issues but as bad periods can cause IBS I could see the card being used this way.\nMost places accept it but some don't.\nIt may be worth seeing if there is anything like the where you live?", "I work at a supermarket and you\u2019d have to go very obviously into staff only areas to get to our staff toilets, if it was that open and easy to get to then definitely NTA. You were desperate and went to the first and closest toilet in a rush, it\u2019s not your fault it happened to be a staff toilet.", ">because it was kind of my fault too\n\nUmm, no.  It was your fault.  YTA.", "You didn\u2019t know and you didn\u2019t notice until it was too late. I would go on google and rate and review the store low explaining that you were period shamed. No one should ever react like that, especially over a restroom.", "NTA. She can ride back into the sunset with the stupid horse she rode in on. If you ever see her again, ask her if she's doing the lord's work protecting the staff only bathroom.", "NTA Was this a chain complain to corporate about how you were treated", "NTA. You had an emergency. Even if you saw the sign, I vote you\u2019re fine to use it. I\u2019ve worked retail in malls before, and I\u2019d be shocked if there weren\u2019t several bathrooms that staff could access should they need it. \n\nI\u2019d never begrudge a woman using it for an emergency.", "Definitely NTA! I completely agree with all the above comments", "Yes, the workers deserve a nicer bathroom, leave it to them", "Bleeding through isn't a reason to not read signs. \n\nI was in labour at the hospital and able to read the signs to get to the correct ward. Being in labour is much worse than bleeding through into your pants. Trust me. And she says that from seeing her doctor she went into the mall. If she was bleeding that bad and she knew, why didn't she ask to use the toilets at the doctor's surgery.", "Most restrooms are locked from the public anymore to keep druggies and homeless people out of them. I\u2019ve had multiple stores refuse to let my toddler doing the pee pee dance use the restroom. It\u2019s so frustrating.", "Definitely NTA. Screw her.", "NTA- I hope that the security guard gets into the same situation, so she receives karma. \nNot your fault and 10000% valid for not paying that close attention. If it's for staff only why wasn't it locked?", "NTA\nIf they didn't want people using it, they should lock it and give every staff member a key.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s just having a go at working her authority over someone else. \n\nImagine if it wasn\u2019t blood, if you needed to actually have a movement. What are you going to do? Poop on the floor instead?", "NTA even if it was staff only and EVEN if you read it, it was an emergency. You didn\u2019t just decide to go into a staff only restroom just because.", "NTA\n\nIt was an emergency, and it was an unlocked bathroom. There are always exceptions (or should be) in an emergency situation.", "nta. even if you did see the sign, you had an emergency to take care of and as women we should understand that. it\u2019s not like you were going in there to tear up the bathroom or be disrespectful", "NTA OP.\n\nThey're trying to remove your dignity by preventing access because of their stupid rules.\n\nEveryone deserves timely access to bathrooms.", "I did not know where the bathroom was. I asked people around and they showed that bathroom and since I was already leaking I went inside without even noticing the sign.", "Yep! Ladies code. I don\u2019t even use pads or tampons but Cary one of each on me just in case I\u2019m asked. I have nieces and family that still use them as well as friends. Can\u2019t tell you how many times my emergency supplies have been happily accepted by another woman in need.", "The doctor's clinic was full of patients waiting to use the bathroom so that the doctor could check them. I tried to get in but I felt like I had to change it immediately so I went to nearest mall, it was a 5min walking distance.", "If it were me and my boss was that uncaring towards humans, especially humans in a bind, I'd talk with OP and tell her I totally understand. Then, if it were on camera, but without audio, I'd tell my boss that I reprimanded OP.  People need to be more understanding. I mean, who cares? That's stupid. I'm sorry OP.", "NTA even a little bit, either you used their bathroom or they slip on a puddle of blood in the middle of the hallway cause that bleeding won't stop for anything, let alone convenient access to a bathroom. \n\nI'm beyond disgusted by the guards reaction & I'm so sorry you went through that. \n\nI really hope your doctor helps you out, push them to look into Endometriosis, PCOS & Adenomyosis, plus ovarian cysts in general. Do not let them tell you that bleeding that heavy and that amount of pain is normal, it's not and there is help available.", "NTA- it was an emergency, in this case, a bathroom was a bathroom!", "NAH\n\nAccidents happen. She's just doing her job. No big deal.", "Nta given your situation. I'd belief you she was just doing her job but she didn't need to be so rude and more understanding.simply would of said I understand just be more aware please.", "I would just ignore her. It\u2019s ok. One time incident.", "NTA, but seriously, why ask that question?! Is was a security guard! Would have been quicker to tell her to go fuck herself, whats she gona do?! Lol", "Adenomyosis, endo's harder to diagnose cousin and just as awful. 30 years of bullshit and 'its not THAT bad'."]}
