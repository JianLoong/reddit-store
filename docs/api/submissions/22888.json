I shouldn't have used the staff bathroom but I didn't really notice until and unless she told me and when I saw the board.

Also, I am not a medical professional but I am a woman who had excessively painful periods for most of my life. I had endometriosis and it took 20 years and facing permanent disability before I found a doctor who could effectively treat it. Know that you may be dismissed, minimized, and gaslit by medical professionals who don't know how to diagnose and treat whatever is causing your excessive pain and bleeding. It's not 'normal', you're not weak, and you don't have a low pain tolerance. If it's not being addressed effectively, it's not a reflection of you, it's inadequate medical education and a crappy system.", "NTA. i understand how embarrassing and stressful a heavy bleed in public can be especially when you can\u2019t get in front of it in time to prevent [visible] accidents. that was my life before getting on birth control. however, it\u2019s not your fault that that bathroom was the most accessible to you in the moment. i hope you\u2019re doing okay, and glad you came prepared with a change of clothes. respect. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "NTA\n\nI have PCOS and sometimes it's sudden and unmanageable if I don't do something right now!   You couldn't wait and you were in such a hurry you didn't see the sign.  I was denied a bathroom once in this instance and by the time I got to where I could deal with it it was too late.   Pants and underwear both bloody big time!  Screw them.", "NTA \n\nShe should have fucked off and focused on her actual job. No one was at risk or in danger by you using that bathroom. Next time, just say \u201csorry bathroom police\u201d and walk away. Security guard are often bored with an ego complex lmao", "NAH.\n\n**You were not the AH -** It was an emergency, and you didn't see which bathroom it was. Even if you saw it, by the time you would run upstairs, dracula would already be chasing after you for all the blood leak you'd be having... But, supposing you knew which bathroom it was, you could have asked someone for permission, but again: you said you *didn't* know that it was *staff only* bathroom... It doesn't make you an AH, it makes you a person who didn't see a sign on a door.\n\n**The security lady is not the AH either -** She might know what you were going through, and even empathize with you and understand it, but she is working and maybe can't show it since she might be being watched... Notice her first phrase to you *\"Did someone stop you from going inside that bathroom?\"* \u2014 this can be an indication that her superiors saw it happening and tried to check if their employees were working properly (in that case: trying to stop you = working properly), and even if she understands your side, sometimes security people have cameras and mics on their uniform, and they must act \"bluntly\" and \"objectively\"...\n\nI know it sucks, but sering through the office people eye's lens: they don't have all that information... All they saw was:\n\n1. a random person entering somewhere they weren't supposed to enter, and \n2. that their employees who were supposed to stop random people from doing X things, not doing what they were supposed to be doing.\n\nThese people would take an hour or so to explain the occurrence to their boss, and sometimes bosses aren't that comprehensive... \n\nI worked at a pharmacy and we were supposed to not allow costumers in staff's bathroom... I got threatened a lot of times while there just for obeying my boss and holding my job (I'm living in a very violent town), but the thing is: there were camera's fvcking everywhere! E v e r y w h e r e! My boss knew what colour my shoes were just by looking at the camera! They knew what money bill the costumer paid with, because there were 3 cameras on the checkout desk! \n\nI also worked on a pub, and when queer people wanted to use the bathroom for the other gender they weren't assigned at birth, and they came to ask me if they could use it, I would blink an eye and say 'You didn't speak to me, and I didn't hear anything. And you better do it while I'm not facing the bathroom direction and people can clearly see that I'm doing something far away from the bathroom sight', then turn my head around, pretend I'm busy to give them time to enter the bathroom they wanted to, and then be it. And then, I would hope they wouldn't snitch me for helping them if they ever got caught! Bcus some people don't understand that as a costumer they are way more protected than the person in an employee position...\n\nI know it all sucks, but thing is: employees are trying to hold jobs! And sometimes we can try doing something, other times we are way more limited... I know, it sucks, it completely sucks! Some things are also dependent on luck...\n\nSo the security chick wasn't an AH (although she could blink her eye to give you a sign, but this is too risky! You could say \"What? What are you trying to say?\" in a very genuine way to understand what is happening, but still, that would be proof she was trying to avoid doing something she was paid to), as for the reasons I've listed here;\n\nAnd you aren't an AH either. You were in an emergency, and according to your words: you didn't see the sign or board at the door... These things happen....\n\nSo: No AHs here.", "YTA. I just happened to have this happen to me actually but I take lasix that makes you pee constantly through the day and when I gotta go.  I gotta go. I had to walk a a lot farther because the closest bathroom was a staff bathroom and I barely made it but it's not a public restroom. You should not use it.", "NTA. \n\nThere are some free bleeders at my work, but that's not for everybody.", "NTA. Typically, staff-only restrooms are either locked and/or have large letters saying \"Staff Only.\" Also, I'm FtM, and I know that when an emergency like that happens, most people are understanding about you cleaning up. Again, NTA.", "Not just that, but the security guard is a woman\u2026 I thought we were all supposed to help each other if someone needs help with their period (like giving pads/tampons if someone asks bc they don\u2019t have any, etc).\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s a woman and just straight up ignored OP\u2019s problem is disheartening. We know (or we should all know) that everyone has a different flow and some have it worse than others.", "I often find that security guards will follow orders without common sense. Like when I have stuff to do at the building where I parked at, and I just had to quickly go store next door to buy something (there was no line) they won\u2019t allow it. Since the parking is only for customers of the stores at the building.", "Any well-adjusted man would have understood your plight too", "This!  So much this!  I have PCOS and it reaurks in additional pain and bleeding.   Like a crazy amount", "Security guard = AH", "Yes, but it was a woman security guard, and it was a lady's bathroom. I meant that no person who would actually use that bathroom would care (except the security guard who doesn't understand the girl code).", "Thumbs up (I don't know how to do that properly)"]}
