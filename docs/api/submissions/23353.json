And frankly, with that kind of talk coming from him I'd be worried he's scamming from your mother's retirement, which is frighteningly common. I bet he's just itching to get his hands on your $30k", "NTA.\n\nThe financial advisor was at best unprofessional.  However, there is also the possibility that he might want control of the money for his own usage - maybe thinking he can steal from your mother more easily.  There is no evidence of this, of course, but it does happen, and it just seems fishy that he would have told you that you don't deserve the money meant for you.  No accusation, but I would keep any eye on this guy and his \"investments.\"", "NTA\n\nThe financial advisor is exceeding his authority in making a \"judgement\".  The phrase \"deserve the money\" sounds like a clue he's got a personal motive. You might ask yourself why that is, if your mother is not financially/investment savvy then she's likely susceptible to financial abuse.  I would get with mom to review all of her financial records, and don't be surprised if there's money missing as a result of that financial advisor having sticky fingers- just be ready to press charges.\n\nIf you're in the US- court records are publicly available by county.  I'd be doing some checking into who your mother has put her financial trust into.", ">My (30f) father passed away a year ago. When he was alive he opened up a life insurance account for me.\n\nNTA - your Dad wanted you to have this money, and your Mom knows that, which is why she has been paying into the account.  It sounds like your Mom's financial advisor is really the impetus behind this; he wants to get his hands on that 30k, and he got in her ear.  His comment does seem entirely innapropriate.  Is there some kind of licensing or regulatory board you could make a complaint with?\n\nEdit to add: I guess you could offer to pay your mom back for whatever payments she made into the account over the last year, that way you can wash your hands of any lingering guilt.  But the payments your Dad made when he was alive were 100% because he wanted you to have that money, and you should not feel bad in the slightest.", "Get your hands on her statements as quickly as you can. This sounds like someone who is desperate for an influx of cash to keep their scheme afloat. And your mother is obviously not savvy enough to know if he is faking statements or reports. If she has online access to her account, look there for actual statements. Tell her you will think about this guy\u2019s proposal if you can look at the investments he put her into so you can see what the returns have been, just to get her to agree to give you this access. Honestly, if he has her in anything other that low risk bonds or other instruments that consider her target retirement age, I\u2019d be very weary. This is a huge red flag, don\u2019t ignore it.", "NTA, and frankly, I would report your mom's financial advisor to his company's bosses or ethics team. What he did was highly inappropriate.", "NTA. I'm concerned about that financial advisor's trustworthiness... Can you urge your mother to get another advisor you both can trust to take a look at her situation? The helping invest the 30k sounds shady.", "NTA --- If I was you I would be getting that money away from that person as fast as possible I wouldn't trust him as far as I could kick him and that's not far at all.", "NTA, your father put that money in there for YOU. I would not trust that advisor, that's very unprofessional and not normal. Something is off and I'd personally be trying to convince her to find a new advisor. It seems almost like they have a personal relationship rather than a professional one.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever what her financial advisor did was unethical and inappropriate. You aren't his client, and he doesn't know your situation. He could be fined and lose his license if you reported him.", "NTA but you should put it to your retirement long term.", "NTA. The advisor had no business getting involved. Very unprofessional of him.  It's your money.", "NTA they put that money into your insurance for you, therefore it belongs to you. If your mother is trying to take it back that\u2019s as if she is trying to take back a present she gave to you.", "NTA.  The financial advisor overstepped.  He had no business calling & telling you this bc it's none of his business.  His job is to give financial guidance, not personal opinions.  You could just split the money with your mom.", "NTA but I would ask to see the records to make sure 30K is all. What nerve  to give judgment! It's not his business! Your father put it in your name.", "NTA. I also talk to your mom about her financial advisor because he is way overstepping his boundaries by calling you to tell you that you don't deserve the life insurance money that your father specifically set aside for you. The fact that he's contacted your mother and said the same thing it sounds like and told her that he can invest it properly for her screams that he's trying to scam her out of this money. If I were you I would have a talk with her and try to find an independent financial advisor to go over every aspect of her financial situation without her current financial advisor knowing what's going on. This way you at least have the Peace of mind knowing that there's nothing shady happening. It is not at all uncommon for financial advisors to screw over clients after they have a spouse that passes away, especially if they know that they weren't the one handling the money.", "Nta. That financial advisor will no doubt be paid to invest the money. Personally I think what he is doing is extremely unethical and assuming he is licensed - he should be reported to the proper agency. Any discussion about how should get the money should be between you and your mother.", "NTA. That financial advisor is trying to get his hands on the money. If he does, he would get a percent of it for managing it. \n\nDo not give your mom the money, or her financial advisor access to it.
