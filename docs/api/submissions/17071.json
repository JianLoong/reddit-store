My brother and I decided to splurge on a 100 roses from a shop and make it look All nice dandy with a card. We planned dinner for her at this not too expensive  restraunt we like going to. She received her things the past few days and enjoyed em and posted em on FB for her her friends to see. Well today my father asked her is she enjoying her flowers and she snapped I guess, she went on a rant saying this isnt what she wanted and that we never asked what she wanted and proceeded to call me and gripe about it to me too. She got mad at all of us obviously and I took it personally and told her she\u2019s being unreasonable and very ungrateful and that we spent good money trying to make it special for her (It\u2019s the thought that counts tho). Well she said she didn\u2019t like anything she received and so we decided to cancel dinner tonight and my fathers gonna return the product and the now she\u2019s throwing an even bigger hit fit. AITA?       EDIT: a flatiron is a straightener for your hair. Where I\u2019m from we call it that. Also we did ask her what she wanted and she said \u201cidk\u201d so we took it upon ourselves to see things that maybe she needed and that was it and she loves flowers. Update as well: my father finally got ahold of her and she\u2019s saying she\u2019s been eyeing this LV purse. Those tend to be expensive so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\n\n\nAnother Update: I decided to take my gf out to have a few drinks and dinner instead. Thank you all for listening !\n\n\nANOTHER UPDATE: pops and brother still took her to the restaurant for dinner but since I didn\u2019t attend imma be the bad person now and imma have to hear ir from you know  who wish me luck\ud83d\ude4f", "created_utc": 1683911218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fqy6q/aita_for_cancelling_dinner_for_mothers_day_after/", "score": 1698, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was a thoughtful observation on his end regarding the flat iron. As for you kids, roses are expensive and 100 of those. That\u2019s very sweet. \n\nYou\u2019re mom is the AH in this sense.

It makes you a crazy person.  \n\nGive her a chance to explain herself.  Talk to her about how this made you feel.  Why is she feeling unheard.  If this is not her usual reaction to things, some thing else is going on with her. Take the time to explore her thoughts, and what is going on.  \n\nI personally don\u2019t get the idea of Mother\u2019s Day, it is a commercial holiday meant to sell cards and flowers, but some women take it as a show of her mothering skills, not just her as a person.  like in a birthday.   We don\u2019t even buy cards, the kids make a dinner and clean up after.  Best gift I\u2019ve ever received was 20 years ago when my daughter cleaned the refrigerator out inside.  As a surprise!  I would take that any day over flowers, or anything else. Do something for her that is mostly her job, but she hates doing.

I could think of a billion of gifts that hold more meaning.", "ESH \nMom way over reacted but I\u2019m betting there\u2019s a reason. I\u2019m guessing what she wants often gets overlooked in that house.\nA straightener is no different than any other appliance, it\u2019s not a gift unless asked for. Might as well get her a new washing machine and say look what I bought you to do all our work and laundry with. \ud83d\ude29 \nWhy didn\u2019t a single one of you ask what she wanted on her day? I assume she asks what y\u2019all want on your birthdays and other special days, so you actually get the things you want or need.\nIt\u2019s the thought that counts is what people say but honestly I don\u2019t see any thought at all put in so that\u2019s why ESH. Flowers and replacing a broken appliance is like bare minimum thought and effort.", "ESH\n\nWell she's right, you didn't ask her what she wanted, no one did apparently.  I think there was some thought in getting her a new flat iron but does she even like roses let alone flowers?  You're all being petty.", "This reply is gonna get lost but I think ESH?\n\nHear me out. Dad heard that mom wanted a new flat iron (dw, I know what you meant) and got her one for MD. Cool, solid plan, I think that's at least an 8/10. Having said that, your mom might be one of those people who prefer time spent with her or acts of service instead of gifts but idk her like that so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nYour brother and you splurging on 100 flowers? Really sweet but a bit impractical. Yeah, your mom might enjoy flowers and taking care of plants but living plants and dying roses in a bouquet are 2 very different beasts. Also, 100? That's a lot to keep fresh for a while. 6/10.\nDinner for the whole family to spend time together for MD? 8.5-9/10 if I'm reading your mom right. Might be the only gift she liked from this batch tho. \n\nAs much as I sympathise, your mom is definitely acting like an AH, tho. Like yeah, the fb posts are probably fake as heck but you got bragging rights over your social circle so take it or leave it, lady. (I'm sorry to say this but your mom is most likely one of those secretly miserable moms who portray a perfect family life to the outside world but is super resentful inside. Alas, that's neither here nor there nvm.) Your mom definitely shouldn't have thrown a tantrum and be grateful to receive gifts but you guys cancelling plans and returning gifts aren't helping (and are kinda telling of your guys' relationship but again nvm).\n\nTL;DR: ESH except maybe dad. Y'all need therapy and family counseling. Mom is resentful while dad and children are petty. Truly a 21st century ideal family.", "ESH\n\nIs she being a bit of a pain? Sure.\n\nBut I have to wonder if a new (hotter) hair straightener is a good choice for an aging woman, who's hair is becoming more and more brittle and thin.\n\nAnd you say she loves caring for roses, what does that mean? Caring for dying ones or living ones? Because I know a lot of people who garden, but only a handful are into floristry.\n\nHow is she under the impression that no one asked but you're under the impression you did? Are you aware of every conversation she had with everyone involved?\n\nSomethings missing. Figure it out.", "ESH - Your mother shouldn't have snapped the way that she did, it was over the top and uncalled for and I feel like there must have been something else going on as well, but it still doesn't negate the fact that she overreacted a bit.\n\nThat being said, You keep talking about how it's the thought that counts, but getting someone 100 roses doesn't really imply that you put much thought into it at all. 100 is just a generic number, it's not specific to anything. Roses are pretty ordinary and it doesn't sound like there's any special meaning behind them. \n\nThe flat iron was ok at best. It was something that she was probably going to replace herself when she actually felt she had to and it depends how often she uses it, just how much she would have spent, but it really does depend on the person and If it was something she wanted to replace herself there may have been a certain one that she was excited to get for herself and instead she got whatever you guys picked out for her, which apparently wasn't one that she actually liked. \n\nIt sounds like you guys have never actually asked her what she might like.\n\nThen, when she finally snaps and tells you that she doesn't want these things, you decide to just cancel everything? And that's it? So it's either she has to accept what you give her (some flowers she didn't want and a flat iron she probably didn't consider a gift so much as you guys grabbing something ahead of time she was already going to buy) or she gets absolutely nothing for a day that's meant to celebrate her?\n\nDepending on how many years this has been going on for, and I'm assuming it's been quite a while, I'd be pretty frustrated with that and might snap a bit too.", "YTA\nIt's mother's day, a day you appreciate your mother and make them feel special. Y'all spent like $50-$100 for 100 roses and let's say $70-$80 for dinner. You could have just bought a decent model one and it would have been fine.", "Giving her roses is a fine idea, but giving her an iron is ridiculous. That\u2019s a work tool, not a present.", "mild YTA this sounds like my family. Either they forget my birthday and MD, or I get random stuff at the last minute. Last birthday they forgot me and did a Walmart run the day after my birthday and spent a ton of money on kitchen appliances I had no desire for. Then I had to spend my time returning them. I would be livid if my family spent money on 100 cut flowers. That might be a beautiful thing for those who show love through gifts, but for those of us who aren't gift people that's just absurd.

(And yes, that car actually exists somewhere in the Middle East, last I knew it was the most expensive car in the world)", "Nice!  -  for the Valentino find not the criminal oligarch.\n\nI concede the quality and design of the really good stuff but the cheap things that they just slap a tag on - that shit must be the most profitable. Cheap material, cheap construction - like a t-shirt with \"Prada\" on it is not worth $400 just because it says Prada!\n\nThe brand I love is Hobo International. The Sheila bag is my bag.  I stalk that bag for a good price in a color I like!", "Between you and me and the rest of reddit I think logo'd luxury purses kinda scream middle class aspirational which seems tacky to me.  Like you're so concerned about impressing other people that you're buying something you can't afford.  It's too obvious.  \n\nI think I take people more seriously when their luxury bag has no logos or a very small logo.  At that point the only people who know are other rich people and you're not trying to scream socioeconomic status from the rooftop because you're comfortable with what you have.", "That makes a lot of sense, about the small logo! I just generally dislike the idea of something having more use as a way to brag than anything else.", "Does your mom usually want specific gifts for holidays? Are her requests always ignored? While I don\u2019t understand your mom not being appreciative of however her children choose to celebrate her, I also know how painful it is to not have your mom anymore. If I were you I would not cancel, but I don\u2019t k ow your family dynamics so not making a judgment.", "NTA. Your mom should be thankful she has her kids to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day instead of  throwing a tantrum over gifts (and all of hers was lovely).  My dear friend just lost her 32 yr old son & my mom lost my brother 15 years ago and these are two moms would be love to be able to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day with their children.", "Question: so what did she want?.  Just curious", "I could give my mom a box of my hair for MD and she would be ecstatic. \n\nYou did something sweet and thoughtful. \n\nNTA", "ESH. \n\nMom for the outburst since there are better ways to handle disappointment. She most likely said \"I don't know\" because most women don't get asked they just get told what they're going to get. Whenever someone says \"I don't know\" please do not continue until you have verified that they will 100% be okay with anything you're going to give them. Get a verbal confirmation, \"So you're okay with anything? Or would you like more time to think about it?\"\n\nPSA to the men in the world for a bit: stop buying expensive 100 rose bouquets (retails approximately for \\~$130-$230) unless you know for a fact this is what your mom wants or you're getting her a gift that costs more. The majority of the women I know consider cut flowers as a waste of money so don't make that the most expensive gift you're giving. The flat iron (\\~$130) was a very good gesture. She probably googled the cost of the roses and realized it was money down the drain. Again, does not absolve her just maybe explains where she was coming from.\n\nI agree that the thought counts when it's a stranger - you don't know them and you're trying your best. Or when money is very tight - you gotta do your best in less than ideal situation. That phrase loses all meaning once it's someone you've known your entire life and if money isn't as tight - which if you can blow almost $200 on roses says something to me. If you already know what you would have gotten your dad for father's day but not your mother, that tells me a lot about your relationship already.", "Either you're not telling us the full story here, or your mum is a massive jerk. I never really know with these things, always two sides but I guess we gotta take yours!", "NTA!!!!!", "She didn\u2019t even need to hint! They ASKED her want she wanted. All she had to do was use her grownup words and tell them what she wanted. But she had to play all coy then got mad. Toddlers shouldn\u2019t be mothers.", "No shit. I appreciate my mother so much more after reading this post", "I had to call my husband out on that too. Not Mothers\u2019 Day because I don\u2019t consider that a gift giving holiday. I don\u2019t entirely remember the context, but he let slip he considered getting me something I explicitly asked for was \u201ccheating\u201d like he had to pass a test by getting me something I would like with out me asking for it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But he would still ask me what I wanted!!! The next holiday when he asked me what I wanted I answered back, \u201cwhy would I tell you if that guarantees you won\u2019t get it?\u201c eventually he realized he was being silly and making life more difficult for himself.", "It's like the whole \"soda vs. pop\" or \"bubbler vs. water fountain\" issue. Whether you say flatiron or hair straightener, the only people who take issue are \"ummmmmm, actUaLLy... \" people you don't want to know.", "nailed it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Never thought about it this way, but you're right. If someone likes flowers, you don't have to agonize over what to give them only to end up giving a gift that they don't care for and now have to decide what to do with. And if they're like me (meaning, not a minimalist) they can dry and preserve the flowers to hold onto them for longer.", "lol my Dad is rubbish at gifts, but he wants to be good and he loves to research things, so in the run up to an occasion I ask for his help to 'research' the thing that I want (he's retired and I'm busy with work full time etc) - never fails to get me the gift I want! \n\nOP, your mom sucks if she was asked what she wants but didn't give an answer; you can't be expected to read her mind.\n\nNTA.", "We would do this for our Nan and part of the gift was planting it for her in her garden (where she chose ofc) made it a fun and special interactive gift", "One of my grandma\u2019s favorite surprises (can\u2019t remember if it was Mother\u2019s Day or birthday) was when I bought a couple sets of solar fairy lights and stuffed them in her glass mosaic gazing balls so she can enjoy them day and night.  She loved it so much she bought more so I could do the same for her sister\u2019s gazing ball.", "Heifer International?! Goddamn. That is *chef's kiss*", "Where I'm from (Michigan) the chemical treatment would be referred to as \"relaxing\" the hair. A flat iron is the same thing as a hair straightener and those terms can be used interchangeably.", "this is so funny, and it reminds me of how my bf told me that one year for secret santa at his job, his coworker got him like a 24 pack of the gingerbread mtn dew and he told me it was the best gift he'd gotten for Christmas that year lmao", "Northern California, I've never heard it referred to as anything but a hair straightener. Chemical straighteners are called exactly that", "That's what I was thinking of!"]}
