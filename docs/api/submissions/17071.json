She got mad at all of us obviously and I took it personally and told her she\u2019s being unreasonable and very ungrateful and that we spent good money trying to make it special for her (It\u2019s the thought that counts tho).

That was a thoughtful observation on his end regarding the flat iron. As for you kids, roses are expensive and 100 of those. That\u2019s very sweet. \n\nYou\u2019re mom is the AH in this sense.

Take the time to explore her thoughts, and what is going on.  \n\nI personally don\u2019t get the idea of Mother\u2019s Day, it is a commercial holiday meant to sell cards and flowers, but some women take it as a show of her mothering skills, not just her as a person.  like in a birthday.   We don\u2019t even buy cards, the kids make a dinner and clean up after.  Best gift I\u2019ve ever received was 20 years ago when my daughter cleaned the refrigerator out inside.  As a surprise!  I would take that any day over flowers, or anything else. Do something for her that is mostly her job, but she hates doing.

I\u2019m guessing what she wants often gets overlooked in that house.\nA straightener is no different than any other appliance, it\u2019s not a gift unless asked for. Might as well get her a new washing machine and say look what I bought you to do all our work and laundry with. \ud83d\ude29 \nWhy didn\u2019t a single one of you ask what she wanted on her day? I assume she asks what y\u2019all want on your birthdays and other special days, so you actually get the things you want or need.\nIt\u2019s the thought that counts is what people say but honestly I don\u2019t see any thought at all put in so that\u2019s why ESH. Flowers and replacing a broken appliance is like bare minimum thought and effort.", "ESH\n\nWell she's right, you didn't ask her what she wanted, no one did apparently.  I think there was some thought in getting her a new flat iron but does she even like roses let alone flowers?  You're all being petty.", "This reply is gonna get lost but I think ESH?\n\nHear me out. Dad heard that mom wanted a new flat iron (dw, I know what you meant) and got her one for MD. Cool, solid plan, I think that's at least an 8/10. Having said that, your mom might be one of those people who prefer time spent with her or acts of service instead of gifts but idk her like that so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nYour brother and you splurging on 100 flowers? Really sweet but a bit impractical. Yeah, your mom might enjoy flowers and taking care of plants but living plants and dying roses in a bouquet are 2 very different beasts. Also, 100? That's a lot to keep fresh for a while. 6/10.\nDinner for the whole family to spend time together for MD? 8.5-9/10 if I'm reading your mom right. Might be the only gift she liked from this batch tho. \n\nAs much as I sympathise, your mom is definitely acting like an AH, tho. Like yeah, the fb posts are probably fake as heck but you got bragging rights over your social circle so take it or leave it, lady. (I'm sorry to say this but your mom is most likely one of those secretly miserable moms who portray a perfect family life to the outside world but is super resentful inside. Alas, that's neither here nor there nvm.) Your mom definitely shouldn't have thrown a tantrum and be grateful to receive gifts but you guys cancelling plans and returning gifts aren't helping (and are kinda telling of your guys' relationship but again nvm).\n\nTL;DR: ESH except maybe dad. Y'all need therapy and family counseling. Mom is resentful while dad and children are petty. Truly a 21st century ideal family.", "ESH\n\nIs she being a bit of a pain? Sure.\n\nBut I have to wonder if a new (hotter) hair straightener is a good choice for an aging woman, who's hair is becoming more and more brittle and thin.\n\nAnd you say she loves caring for roses, what does that mean? Caring for dying ones or living ones? Because I know a lot of people who garden, but only a handful are into floristry.\n\nHow is she under the impression that no one asked but you're under the impression you did? Are you aware of every conversation she had with everyone involved?\n\nSomethings missing. Figure it out.", "ESH - Your mother shouldn't have snapped the way that she did, it was over the top and uncalled for and I feel like there must have been something else going on as well, but it still doesn't negate the fact that she overreacted a bit.\n\nThat being said, You keep talking about how it's the thought that counts, but getting someone 100 roses doesn't really imply that you put much thought into it at all. 100 is just a generic number, it's not specific to anything. Roses are pretty ordinary and it doesn't sound like there's any special meaning behind them. \n\nThe flat iron was ok at best. It was something that she was probably going to replace herself when she actually felt she had to and it depends how often she uses it, just how much she would have spent, but it really does depend on the person and If it was something she wanted to replace herself there may have been a certain one that she was excited to get for herself and instead she got whatever you guys picked out for her, which apparently wasn't one that she actually liked. \n\nIt sounds like you guys have never actually asked her what she might like.\n\nThen, when she finally snaps and tells you that she doesn't want these things, you decide to just cancel everything? And that's it? So it's either she has to accept what you give her (some flowers she didn't want and a flat iron she probably didn't consider a gift so much as you guys grabbing something ahead of time she was already going to buy) or she gets absolutely nothing for a day that's meant to celebrate her?\n\nDepending on how many years this has been going on for, and I'm assuming it's been quite a while, I'd be pretty frustrated with that and might snap a bit too.", "YTA\nIt's mother's day, a day you appreciate your mother and make them feel special. Y'all spent like $50-$100 for 100 roses and let's say $70-$80 for dinner. You could have just bought a decent model one and it would have been fine.", "Giving her roses is a fine idea, but giving her an iron is ridiculous. That\u2019s a work tool, not a present.", "mild YTA this sounds like my family. Either they forget my birthday and MD, or I get random stuff at the last minute. Last birthday they forgot me and did a Walmart run the day after my birthday and spent a ton of money on kitchen appliances I had no desire for. Then I had to spend my time returning them. I would be livid if my family spent money on 100 cut flowers. That might be a beautiful thing for those who show love through gifts, but for those of us who aren't gift people that's just absurd.

Now if I didn\u2019t get the shoes I wanted but let\u2019s say they drew me a picture and gave me $10 I\u2019d still be happy because it doesn\u2019t take much to make me happy honestly. My family and my bestfriend never get me anything on my bday due to me not ever wanting anything but if I do receive stuff I gladly accept !", "It sounds like she did get the flat iron though? Or am I missing something?", "You know what? That's fair, and I'll be changing my judgement.", ">she went on a rant saying this isnt what she wanted and that we never asked what she wanted \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen why wouldn't you have said 'But we did and she said 'idk' in your story? \n\nIf your orig story didn't include this line and / or if it included this 'new' information I might believe you and change my vote. But I don't.", "I agree. If it was GHD or something thats an awesome gift. Also the fact that it's something she uses often, its likely something she can't justify replacing herself so it would make a nice gift. She's just being ungrateful imo.", "I agree. I use mine everyday and it doesn't work that well anymore. But I'm too cheap to spend that kind of money on myself. I'd be delighted if someone bought me a nice one as a gift.", "Dude you keep ignoring the fact that all she asked for was a flat iron.", "She got it but my fathers gonna return it since that isn\u2019t what she wanted", "No she did get it", "Because I\u2019m repeating what she said that\u2019s all, you\u2019re right I should\u2019ve included that part.", "I update the post bout 15 min ago or so bud, that isn\u2019t what she wanted lol she wants a LV purse I spoke to my dad and brother on a 3 way call 20 min ago"]}
