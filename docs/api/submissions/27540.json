Sorry for the long story I tried to make it as short as I could. :)\n\nI (16m) have a step-brother, \"Mike,\"(18m) who has been suffering from anorexia for years. He's very self-conscious about his weight and I know it affects him a lot, but lately, he's been using it as an excuse to get away with everything.\n\nAt first, it started with small things like skipping out on helping around the house, but over time, it's gotten worse. He always expects everyone to  to take care of his needs and to make special exceptions for him because \"he's too weak\" to do things like take the trash out.\n\nRecently, Mike has started to take his anorexia to a whole new level. He's been constantly telling everyone in the family to eat just like him and to avoid any unhealthy food. He doesn't believe in cheat days or special treats, and he gets upset if anyone else enjoys something he can't.\n\nThis has been particularly difficult for his mother (my stepmother), who loves to cook and bake. She's a very talented chef, but Mike's restrictions have made it impossible for her to cook anything he can't eat. Our whole household has been reduced to eating simple meals that Mike can tolerate, and it's had a significant impact on our quality of life.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mike has started to throw away any food he considers \"unhealthy.\" He'll go through our cabinets and fridge, throwing away anything he deems inappropriate for a \"healthy diet.\" This has resulted in countless arguments between Mike and the rest of the family, with Mike insisting that he's doing everything he can to protect his recovery, while others are accusing him of being controlling and intolerant.\n\nThe other day, I finally reached my breaking point. Mike had been acting particularly entitled, demanding special treatment for even the simplest tasks. I snapped and told him that he couldn't keep using his eating disorder as an excuse for everything.\n\nWe got into a big argument, with me telling him that his illness doesn't give him the right to make everyone else's life miserable. He, of course, tried to throw the anorexia card in my face, saying that he's sick and he needs special treatment to survive.\n\nMeanwhile, our parents overheard our argument and jumped in, calling me a jerk for being so insensitive to Mike's struggles. They told me that I needed to have more empathy for him and understand that his illness is a serious matter.\n\nI know Mike's disorder is a real problem, but I also know that he's using it to manipulate everyone around him. Our family can't continue to live like this, with everyone tiptoeing around Mike's every whim just to keep him from shutting down.\n\nSo, AITA for finally speaking up and calling Mike out on his behavior?", "created_utc": 1695557878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qwcxy/aita_for_telling_my_stepbrother_that_his_anorexia/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anything he didn't approve of got thrown away the second no one was looking, and he'd destroy the food, not just throw it away, like tear it all up, pour things on it, wreck the food.\n\nLittle did we realize at the time, that was the first sign my family member was schizophrenic. Throwing out food they suspected, for some paranoid reason (the CIA got to it, or something) with the excuse the food wasn't \"safe\" or \"healthy\" for us. He never did have an eating disorder, he was just paranoid the CIA got into his food so he stopped eating.  I'm not saying your step brother is schizophrenic, but I DO feel like there's more going on here. Once a week therapy isn't helping, he needs more. In-patient therapy maybe. Like rehab for people with major eating disorders.\n\nYou're NTA for refusing to cater to him. You've made allowances for him, you've held space to try to be understanding of his struggle. The fact he's milking it for all he's worth is not your fault and good on you for calling him out.", "NTA. Anorexics don't behave like that", "NTA. It is not okay to let Mike make these demands unchecked and it's absolutely *not okay* to feel into his illness by letting him get away with this behaviour. \n\nHaving foods around that he will eat: good.\n\nCreating an environment he will eat in: good.\n\nReinforcing the idea of good and bad food by allowing him to dictate the diet everyone is eating: not good.\n\nJustifying a new eating disorder by rewarding an unhealthy relationship with food: *not good*.\n\nClassifying foods as \"good\" and \"bad\" (or healthy and unhealthy as Mike is calling it) is a slippery slope. Anorexia (nervosa and bulimia) are partially characterised by the *control* elements of eating. If Mike is still controlling his food in a disordered way, characterising it in black and white rather than as a spectrum from often to occasional, then he isn't recovering or doing well. He's just changing the way his disorder is presenting. Sure, it might get him to eat some things *now*, but then what is \"good\", what is \"healthy\", will change and eventually he'll be at a point where he isn't eating enough.", "NTA\n\nHe's not in recovery. He is pulling all of you into his disorder with him. And you are not wrong to him out on it. Your parents are enabling him, and they need to stop. Anorexia is so dangerous. The malnutrition kills people, even years later. You need to protect *your* health as well as his. Changing everything to pander to someone's disorder does *not* help. Ever. Don't stop standing up for your rusts to watch normally.", "Nta.  Sounds like Mike is getting sicker.  Your family is enabling a sick man.", "Definitely NTA.  You are correct.  Mike is using his illness as an excuse to control everything and everyone around him.  Anorexia as an illness is a hell, but family members adapting to the illness just reinforces it.  If Mike and his parents haven't been in therapy, they need to go asap or go back if they stopped.  Anorexia has obsessive and compulsive features as well that Mike seems to be experiencing.  \n\nYou need to keep boundaries between your life choices and Mike's illness.  You can live a healthy and independent existence and still care about your step-brother.  Allowing your step-brother's distorted thinking to affect your life is unhealthy and not fair to you.", "NTA.  Mike's behavior is likely to trigger an ED in someone else.  His throwing away other people's food and trying to control everyone else is a symptom of his ED and its dangerous for him amd all those around him", "NTA for calling him out on it, but Mike sounds like he needs a lot more help than he's getting to treat his ED.  And it sounds like you all could benefit from family counseling as well.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is very much the AH in his behavior and attitude. Through his manipulation, claiming you all aren't supporting him the way he needs, he is making it harder for real support to happen and easier for stigma to thrive. Which adds another layer of AHness. I'm sorry you're having to adult and do what your parents need to.\n\nThis requires intensive intervention, onsite/inpatient in some capacity. If he really is so dedicated to his recovery, it shouldn't be hard to get him to participate.\n\nThe family needs support too. https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/free-low-cost-support is a good place to start.\n\nGood luck.", "nta if he's too weak to take out the garbage then where does he get the strength to clean out the fridge and pantry?", "NTA. Throwing away food in the household and expecting everyone to eat the same as him is unacceptable behaviour. I can 100% see that it is due to his ED that he's doing this, but that means that he needs to work on it in therapy. Chances are, with \"unhealthy\" food present, he's scared he'll binge- or not binge, just eat a little. And if it's food that his ED is telling him is not allowed, then he's trying to avoid it at all costs. If it's not in the house, he can't have access to it. If you're eating the same simple, safe meals as him, he won't be tempted by seeing your food, and won't be tempted to break the anorexia's rules, and eat some.\n\nI say this because, if you can, try to remember that this isn't your stepbrother talking. It's his eating disorder. He says he's trying to \"protect his recovery\"- ask him how restricting his foods so much is promoting a healthy relationship with food, and how making the people around him follow his rules can be good examples of healthy, free relationships with food? It's not uncommon for people who start recovery from anorexia to switch into orthorexia- because hey, they're eating, so yay! They've made so much progress! Meanwhile, their relationship with food is just as unhealthy. It's just presenting in a different way. Him talking about expecting you to support his recovery by him controlling what you eat is 100% his ED talking, I guarantee it.\n\nUnfortunately, EDs can make us believe a lot of things that aren't true. They can also make us cruel to people, especially people trying to help us. I'm not excusing his behaviour, I'm more saying that this is the type of thing that, once he recovers, he will be deeply ashamed of having done. It doesn't mean he gets a free pass to do whatever he wants- especially not when it's the ED that's doing these things, it's even more reason for you to not accept it, as you don't want to encourage the ED. I just want to say that I know you're frustrated and annoyed, and rightly so, but your real stepbrother is underneath there, somewhere. And he'll eventually return.\n\nI will say, him being too weak to take the trash out is entirely possible. You can lose a lot of muscle when you have anorexia, you get tired from the tiniest bit of exertion, you get exhausted after packing the dishwasher. He may literally be too weak to carry the trash out. I couldn't even do a wall push-up when I was sick. I 100% see how that's possible.\n\nHe may have been told that he needs to do minimal physical movement. Like his current orders may be to improve diet, and essentially be on bed rest to let his body recover, and especially if his intake isn't enough, any physical activity should be discouraged, because physical activity requires more calories, and he currently needs all the calories he can get. I would clarify that with his therapist/doctor, and then I would come up with ways that he can contribute to the house with minimal physical exertion. For example, he could fold laundry. He could sit on a stool and do any washing up that needs to be done by hand. He can water the garden by taking a chair out, sitting on it and watering everything he can reach in that chair, then move the chair onto the next section. However, sometimes in recovery we are told that we can still do light movement such as housework, grocery shopping, and maybe some restorative yoga. That helps you to not become deconditioned. It's hard though, knowing when someone needs to be restricted from most things, and when they can start using their body. There's also a point where they will then be advised to start engaging in light exercise, usually with the help of someone like an exercise physiologist, to promote a healthy relationship with exercise. Anyway, my main point is that you need to clarify with his doctor what his activity levels need to be right now. They will be able to support you, and if the doctor says nope, he should be doing light housework, then that's what he should be doing. It may be tiring at first, but he needs to build back him his strength and stamina, and the only way to do that is to keep working on it, slowly. The doctor's visit will also mean that you've heard it straight from the professional, so you'll know for sure if your stepbrother is trying to take advantage of you.\n\nIt seems like some family therapy may be needed, so he can realise that his actions aren't acceptable, and they're not helping his recovery. Your parents are currently terrified. Statistically, he has a 20% chance of dying, about a 40% chance of improving, but living for the rest of his life with it, and about a 40% chance of fully recovering. It has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. I can understand why they think they're doing the right thing- after all, he's eating, which is what they want, and he's saying that doing X and Y will help him. However, they're not helping, and family therapy can help them to see that. It can help you to work out as a family how to best support Mike in a healthy way, guided by the therapist. I would recommend making sure that it's a family therapist that specialises in eating disorders, as it can be very difficult from typical family therapy. Make sure you say that you're not doing family based treatment, aka Maudsley, as this is very different to going to family therapy due to an eating disorder!\n\nLastly, there are many resources out there for carers and loved ones of people with EDs, usually from charities. There's everything from peer support chatrooms, helplines, learning modules, workshops, talks etc etc. The main UK one is Beat, the main USA one is NEDA, but ANAD also do family support groups and guides, and the Butterfly Foundation is the main one in Australia. They're not perfect, but it could help your parents to understand that your brother's actions aren't actually helpful for recovery, while you're waiting for family therapy.\n\nIn the meantime, I know it's so hard, but try to take care of yourself. Is there anyone you can talk to that won't judge you? A school counsellor? It's important that you remember that this can have a big impact on you too, and that you remember to just be a teenager sometimes.\n\nSending you light and strength.", "No.  Because he lives in the real world.  A guy i know is an alcoholic (he\u2019s on disulphiram out of habit these days; been sober 7 years and counting) and he comes with us to restaurants and bars when we hang out\u2026without drinking alcohol.  We\u2019re not going to avoid a restaurant just because they serve alcohol.  I myself have a tempestuous relationship with food but all it takes is a little self control.

Sorry for the long story I tried to make it as short as I could. :)\n\nI (16m) have a step-brother, \"Mike,\"(18m) who has been suffering from anorexia for years.

(It\u2019s not worth the risk.)\n\nI\u2019m also concerned about whether or not you are getting proper nutrition, and it\u2019s the responsibility of adults to advocate for you - especially as someone who is a minor.\n\nEmpathy shouldn\u2019t require you to hand over control of your diet to someone else.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no such thing as good foods or bad foods.", "NTA. His behavior is affecting the family as a unit and you expressed yourself.  Could you have sat down and said it calmly in a family meeting? Sure.  But life doesn't always work that way.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you need family therapy to address this dynamic.\n\nBut, fundamentally, his problems with food are not your problem and shouldn't be made into your problem.", "NTA he is literally making life all about his anorexia that is not healthy at all.   He needs some real intervetion for this.  As it can make things worse not better.", "Serious question, not trying to be rude or anything. Why is someone with an eating disorder telling your family how to eat? Are the professionals backing up anything Mike is saying?? \n\nThis is someone who has a problem with food to the point where a trained professional with a tremendous depth of knowledge on the topic diagnosed them. Why would that patient who has a clear issue with food be the one who tells others how to consume food? It doesn't make any sense.", "Get a job and eat out. Run as soon as you legally can.", "Hey! Thank you for reading my post. \n\nMike has been going to therapy once a week for the past four months. At first we all thought it'll help him but he seems to be getting even worse. I don't have much details about this because my parents don't want to share Mike's problems with me.", "I had a friend who was initially diagnosed with an eating disorder, but it turned out to be severe OCD. He was obsessed with germs, and gradually his list of \"clean foods\" got so small he stopped eating entirely so as not to contaminate himself, and required hospitalisation. \n\nAs someone who has struggled with eating disorders, at no point was I ever upset about what the people around me were eating. While anorexia is often about the ability to control one's own life, I've never seen it extend to others this way. I am not a doctor, just have known a number of people with mental health issues, so I'm just speaking from personal experience.", "Yup when there's \"requests\" that are really DEMANDS, then it's no longer reasonable accommodation but coddling. \n\nIf he's really concerned about recovery then he'll realize sooner rather than later that part of recovery is being able to deal with unpleasant and less than ideal situations. A recovering alcoholic can certainly tell others as appropriate they can't accept gifted wine nor drink themselves, but they don't get to foam at the mouth and dump wine someone at a restaurant over the next table is drinking.", "Entitled people do", "As someone with an ED I can agree. there\u2019s definitely some underlying ego and narcissistic personality issues. Mike needs to be emitted into an inpatient facility", "Thank you for this comment! I appreciate all the things written here. I've read a lot about anorexia and eating disorders in general because as I said this has been going on for years. Honestly, I never really looked at it from his point of view and now I feel kinda like the real AH. I'm going to try and talk with my father first and then see what happens. :)", "Recovering alcoholic here. I\u2019m glad your friend is at a point in his sobriety where he can go to restaurants serving alcohol, but it\u2019s often very necessary for alcoholics in the first years of sobriety to avoid places that serve alcohol. Simple self-control isn\u2019t enough to conquer diseases like alcoholism or anorexia. Asking for and receiving healthy support and accommodation from the people around us is what allows us to heal. OP\u2018s brother may not be receiving very healthy support, but the idea that he should just use his self-control to get better probably isn\u2019t right either.", "He's going to therapy every week. I personally don't see a change in his actions/attitude so I'm planning on talking to my dad about it. (Just to make sure there's no confusion, my biological dad is married to Mike's biological mom)", "Thank you for reading my post! I hope you're doing okay and get better soon! Sending love! :)", "Mention orthorexia to them- people with eating disorders can shift into other eating disorders like obsession with eating \"healthy\"/\"clean\" and that masks the new eating disorder because caregivers are looking for the old symptoms.", "He may need another therapist if the current one is triggering his lack of control. (Eds are a symptom of lack of control in ones life, so they control what they can in their bodies or what they eat, or what the household eats.)", "Same. When I was most ill in my ED, I obsessively baked and cooked and fed others, and in my 30 years of therapy with others who have EDs, this is quite common. Mike\u2019s behavior is not.", "Except that being allowed to control what everyone else in the house eats isn't helpful to someone with anorexia. Seeing other people enjoy food is often helpful, and seeing other people with severely restricted diets is the kind of thing that can trigger a relapse", "You\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m sorry your family is dealing with this.", "Sounds like he needs inpatient care if he can\u2019t function in a normal household, it\u2019s one thing to be sensitive to their illness such as not constantly talking about food or their issues, it\u2019s another for them to need to control everyone and everything around him.", "Thanks for bringing this up. This explains several things going on in my family.", "Agree! That\u2019s why I said he is not receiving healthy support. But the idea that he shouldn\u2019t need or receive *any* support is probably not productive or accurate.", "Ironically, being around people who are eating the foods they enjoy and having positive interactions with food would be better for his recovery. He's not asking for support; he's trying to force his family to join in on his unhealthy behavior"]}
