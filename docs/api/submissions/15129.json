We both work, we just don\u2019t get paid enough. My boyfriend and I help around the house and my dad loves taking care of my son \u201cBrandon\u201d, he works from home and if he\u2019s too busy my grandma comes over to help out if my boyfriend and I are both be at work.\n\nMy mom passed away 7 years ago and it took a toll on everyone, my brother \u201cRoger\u201d took it the hardest. My mother was always sick, my sister \u201cFaith\u201d and I were both homeschooled but my mom had a stroke and we were both sent to public high school, once Roger was 8 my mom was able to speak again and homeschooled him, but she passed away once Roger was 13 and he was forced to go to public high school too. \n\nFaith and I, no longer lived at my dad\u2019s house since we both went to out of state colleges. So Rodger from around 13 to now,  only had my dad and a few other family members who did all his school work and projects so he would graduate high school. \n\nMy dad is a GREAT father for birth to around 6 but after that he just doesn\u2019t have patience. My mom had the patience.\n\nRoger locks himself in his room, refuses to get a job, a license, go to the gym, or go to college. He is invited to go out but refuses, my family has given up on him. He goes to therapy once a week and was 5150d once a couple of months ago. Now all he does is take his medicine, draw, and play videos games online. My dad left out of the country about a month ago for his dads funeral.\n\nA week ago, I was off from work taking care of Brandon, he was crawling around and exploring his environment. When he\u2019s climbing and playing independently I sit in the stairwell so he won\u2019t climb down, and I scroll on my phone (everything\u2019s baby proof). While scrolling, Roger, comes out of his room, gives me his usually dirty look, and goes down to the kitchen to grab food. I continue to scroll. Roger comes back upstairs and begins screaming and yelling at Brandon, I quickly get up and run over and Brandon is sitting (not touching anything) in Rogers room, Roger left the door open and Brandon crawled in. I pick up Brandon and quickly apologize to Roger. Roger begins to yell at me about how he could\u2019ve messed up his expensive wires and that I\u2019m a bad mom and that I should keep a better eye on my \u201ckid\u201d. I say \u201cI apologized, I didn\u2019t think Brandon would go in there since your door isn\u2019t ever left open.\u201d After I say this, Brandon is in my arms holding the door frame, he looks at Brandon\u2019s fingers and slams the door, I pulled him back in time but Brandon cries. I yell (to Roger) \u201ctake your own car go buy your own milk asshole\u201d. I called my family and everyone (minus my grandma and aunts) say I should explain that Brandon is a baby and I shouldn\u2019t have crossed his boundaries. I have nothing against my brother but yelling at a baby is too far in my opinion, Roger and I haven\u2019t spoke since, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681836943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qw2xj/aita_for_yelling_at_my_27_brother_19_for_yelling/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His reaction to me sounds almost instinctual, like an animal protecting their home from perceived threats that aren't there and reacted poorly. Yes it's up to him to close his door, and yes he made the extremely asshole move by slamming the door and almost crushing baby fingers. I just hope he gets the outside support he desperately needs.", "NTA but you probably should look for roomates or other arrangements to live elsewhere.

There is nothing that baby could've done to warrant such an extreme reaction from him. You were much more level-headed than I would've been in this situation. I honestly might've become violent if I were in your shoes if he displayed such rage and vitriol towards a fucking BABY. \n\nSuch rage and attempted violence towards an infant is not normal. I'd say it's bordering on sociopathic, even. Roger is dangerous and he needs to be in some kind of inpatient facility after this. \n\nWhat if you hadn't walked in when you did? The very thought makes me shudder.", "Info: Who has med POA re: your brother?", "ESH. Your brother was isolated at home with a sick, disabled mother and a father who \u201cdidn\u2019t have patience\u201d for him. Your parents *chose* to homeschool him, depriving him of the safety net school provides- access to mental health services, mandated reporters that report child abuse and neglect, social interaction, friendships, sports, rites of passage like homecoming, prom, pep rallies, enrichment like drama club, band, orchestra\u2026 Schools aren\u2019t perfect but they offer a lot of opportunities. He had mental health issues. He\u2019s surrounded by family who refuses to deal with him because- what- his despair and anger and loneliness are too difficult for you? \n\nYou brought your child into this toxic situation. Your brother sounds like he had a temper and is unsafe around your baby. He should never have yelled at your baby but *he has a mental illness that no one seems willing to address*.", "NTA\n\nIf your brother was my brother, his life would be hell.\nI wouldn't get physical, but he would lose everything of meaning to him.", "So your brother slammed the door with the intention or at least the lack of care that your 10 month old son could be hurt and you wonder if YOU are the AH?\n\nUM NO.  If i read your post correctly.  Family did your brother's homework instead of actually having him learn anything.  Now he does nothing but play video games and waste his life and you are somehow the problem?\n\nop=NTA but your brother needs help and  your father needs to stop enabling him.", "ESH but he sucks more. Trying to slam the door on a baby\u2019s hand, wtf? However, you are aware that you basically screamed at Brandon as well, and louder than your brother, seeing as you did so while you held him in your arms? Just because it wasn\u2019t directed *at* him, that certainly wasn\u2019t a great choice either.", "NTA- it sounds like he acted almost on instinct at first and took it way too far. I disagree with him necessarily needing to be committed as others have commented though. He has ostracized himself already. I guess my question is: I\u2019m his current mental state does he understand what he did wrong???? There should definitely be some sort of intermission with him to ensure that he understands how serious his actions could have been. After years of dealing with depression myself I would go out on a limb and say it\u2019s on his list of diagnosis. Extreme outbursts of anger like this can be common when his safe space is threatened. It\u2019s absolutely NOT ok for him to act this way. But if he has psych issues as you stated he may not entirely understand what he has done. I would also venture to say that after he has had time to cool off you guys should have a serious discussion with him and the other close members of your family about his mental status. I personally see a lack of maturity for a 19 year old especially you mentioned his lack of being social or getting himself lined up to work and take on responsibilities. I would also encourage you try to acknowledge that just because he is medicated and in therepy does not mean he has the capability of doing what is right. Especially if his diagnosis comes with impulsive decisions and or anger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
