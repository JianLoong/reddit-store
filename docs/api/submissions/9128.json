Your daughter is 9 years old. What did you expect. That she would stay in the car while you all got out. Why was the dog not in a crate ? Driving with a not secured dog is not safe. What if the dog jumps on the drivers seat? And why does he just jump outside? Thats also unsafe. Train your dog!", "YTA my main issue here is you left a 9 year old girl alone in an unlocked car near a busy street! So many things could've gone wrong!\n\nIf you were worried about the dog running away why didnt you buy a doggy seatbelt?", "YTA. Not her dog. Not her responsibility. YTA for making her responsible when she\u2019s only NINE and unfamiliar with the dog and it\u2019s habits. And when she failed at an adult task (keeping the dog in the car) you were cruel to her. You could have put a leash on the dog and attached it to the seat back. You could have crated the dog. You could have taken the dog to the kennel. You set up your nine year old daughter to fail. And when she failed and needed comfort, you were cruel to her.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. Why are you leaving your 9-year-old daughter in the car alone? Why do you guys get to stretch your legs and see things and she doesn't? Why couldn't you all get out (with the puppy on a leash)? \n\nAnd last, but not least, WHY WAS THE 9-YEAR-OLD LEFT IN CHARGE OF AN UNTRAINED PUPPY WHEN THERE WERE 2 FULLY CAPABLE ADULTS (ONE OF WHOM IS THE OWNER OF THE DOG)??? Did you plan this trip for the weekend your daughter was there just so you could have a built-in puppy sitter?\n\nYou were thinking only of yourself and gave no consideration to your DAUGHTER. As a dog owner I do feel sorry for your girlfriend, I would be inconsolable if my dog ran away but you guys are the adults and responsibility ultimately falls on you, not the literal child.", "How did a stop at a gas station for a drink and bathroom take 15 minutes? Why are you taking a road trip with a dog and small child if they have to stay in the car on most stops? I have so many questions.\n\nYTA. She is 9. You left her unsupervised. It sounds like it was an accident. It would have avoidable if you planned a trip around a 9 year old and a dog instead of just repeatedly abandoning them in a car.", "Wow YTA. She\u2019s nine. There a few things. \n1. Why the actual hell would it be a good idea to leave a nine year old alone in the car\n2. Why would you give her sole responsibility of the dog, she\u2019s nine. \n3. Nine year olds get bored, don\u2019t just leave her alone and expect her to be occupied, maybe she got scared and wanted to find you. \n4. She didn\u2019t do this with any malicious intent, this is all negligence on your part. \n\nYTA to the max. Apologize and hope she forgives you.", "YTA 1. Why could one of you stay with your daughter or she comes with you, 2. Why giving her the responsibility and 3. Scolding her. YTA and then the worst not hugging her. How awful are you, she is your daughter!!!!! And it sounds like she was in the way of you and your gf trip even though it was your daughter's weekend with you. shame on you also she was already upset about the dog. Great way to make her feel worse YTA", "YTA\n\nAnyone else think this is the same troll with the foster child?\n\nGet back under your bridge, troll.", "Info: So you wanted your 9yo to go running around in traffic after a dog that was probably really fast and she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch? \n\nYeah it wasn\u2019t smart of her to open the door, but the fact you wouldn\u2019t even hug her or say goodbye was mean. She didn\u2019t let the dog out intentionally.", "YTA. \n\nYou made your nine year solely responsible for your girlfriend's dog on a \"road trip\" and left her alone in the vehicle repeatedly for \"stops\" you had to make. This wasn't a road trip. It was an errand day where you made your kid the dog sitter. She told you she was bored. She told you she wanted out of the car. At the last stop you could have waited in the car with the dog while your girlfriend used the toilet and could have gotten your kid a drink and let her stretch her legs for a bit. \n\nAlso, why did the dog need to be on Emily's lap the entire time? Sarah should have been caring for her dog while in the car. Not the nine year old. \n\nYour last part is the worst. You used your kid and then treated her terribly because two irresponsible adults gave her a responsibility she wasn't ready for. You are more worried about Sarah's feelings than those of your child.", "YTA\n\nLeaving your kid in the car is neglect and can get you arrested already, but you literally just towed her along in the car all day? Like what is actually wrong with you.\n\nGet. A. Vasectomy. \n\nStop being a selfish parent and put your kid first.", "YTA. You made multiple stops & left your 9yo in the car alone. Those stops ensured you & Sarah were getting out and stretching and breaking the monotony of a trip, but when your 9 year old CHILD showed signs of being antsy and expressed boredom, you told her that's what she signed up for. Wtf. YOU planned this trip for a weekend she was there. This is all on you. Any child who has already expressed boredom and being antsy would have eventually opened a door to get out with you at one of your multiple pit stops.\n\nThen, to top it off, you denied her any affection or reassurance...over a dog. You just showed her (probably not the 1st time) that your girlfriend is more important than her, and she will not forget it. You & your girlfriend aren't wanting to be parents, obviously - your daughter will be better off staying with her mom & you going to live your life without her. It's what you're doing now, but she'll be better off emotionally in the long run to not be there for it.", "Yta. So you and girlfriend wanted to make stops while your daughter just sat in car with the dog. Why didn\u2019t Sarah take your daughter inside the store as well to use the restroom. Why did someone have to stay in the car the entire time with the dog? If Emily never went on the trip then what would have happened to the dog, who would have watched the dog while making all these stops? So many questions and yta for putting that responsibility on a 9 year old and being an inconsiderate father.", "YTA and if you don't see why I'm thinking nothing I can say can convince you otherwise", "YTA. Your girlfriend's dog is her *own responsibility,* not your 9-year-old daughter's. I'm sure your daughter would have liked to get out of the car and move around like you and your girlfriend during a road trip, but instead you made her stay cooped up in the car the entire time. \n\nAnd I'm sure your daughter feels terrible about the dog and you're just piling on more guilt by refusing to acknowledge her. You and your girlfriend are extremely selfish and irresponsible and you both need to grow up.", "her dog, her duty, nobody else's.\n\nimagine 2 adults too incompetent to put a leash on a dog and then scolding a 9-year-old....\n\nyta", "YTA.  A 9 year old girl (or the dog) should ever be left alone in a car out of your eyesight.  What happens when some stranger comes along and kidnaps her.

You broke your kids heart because of an accident! Congrats! Once she's 18 you'll never hear from her again because you and your girlfriend are irresponsible!", "YTA.", "YTA and the dog getting lost is your and Sarah's fault. I would not for a minute consider leaving a child in charge of my dog, especially a child that has expressed being bored and already getting restless. You guys are the dumbest couple. And you're leaving both in the car on all these stops? And dogs need to get out too, not just Emily. Then you blame her and end the trip early, don't even show affection, you have traumatized the poor girl and she'll always remember this. And why? Because a grown woman can't stay behind to watch her dog or carry it in like countless other small dog owners do? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA! You left a CHILD responsible for a dog that isn\u2019t even hers. So many things wrong with this entire story. Sounds like your daughter is a major inconvenience to you. Start putting your child first OP.", "YTA. Emily didn't do anything to Sarah's dog. Emily was stuck in the car for a road trip for FIVE HOURS and is 9. You wouldn't even let her step out for a minute? Put the leash on the dog and go for a quick walk? She's literally 9, how can you expect her to be patient and stay in the CAR for FIVE HOURS? What if she needed to use the bathroom? Wanted a snack? Or literally just wanted to stretch her legs? I have taken 6 hour drives as an adult and there's no way I wouldn't have wanted to get my self out of that car. She let the dog out by accident, who cares? She's 9, she's bored out of her mind, she might not have ever been responsible for a dog before without parental supervision. She did nothing wrong and the fact that you wouldn't even hug her is awful. Mistakes happen. Mistakes happen even more often when you're this unfair to your 9 year old.", "YTA. If you take a road trip as a family, it\u2019s exactly that, AS A FAMILY. You don\u2019t repeatedly leave your 9 year old in the car while you and your new girlfriend go check things out. This is straight up neglect and if I was your daughters mother, I\u2019d be going to court to ensure you lose custody.", "YTA. Pets are ultimately an adult responsibility. Anything that happens to a dog in these situations is the adults responsibility. They can\u2019t mentally make adult decisions like look after the dog at all times.

Their brains literally can\u2019t.\n\nHope you guys find the dog.", "INFO: Are you the father describing putting your 9-year-old child into a position of responsibility for watching your girlfriend\u2019s pet while you went on a road trip with your girlfriend, and left that child alone in the car with the dog for a quarter of an hour??", "This whole post was just made to anger people. The account was made today and the reasons OP gives are stupid.", "YTA - you took your 9 year old kid on a road trip and then made her stay in the care alone for the majority of it \n\nThen after what was probably a really stressful and intense situation, you completely ignore her, and don\u2019t even hug or kiss her goodbye, which to an upset 9 year old means you don\u2019t love her anymore\n\n\nEmily didn\u2019t do anything to the dog, it was an accident, its your fault for leaving a nine year old spine in a car repeatedly when she said she was bored, she just have felt suffocated \nJesus Christ", "YTA, you left your 9 year old daughter alone in the car for nearly 15 minutes,   luckily she wasn't kidnapped while you were abandoning her. The fact you think you are in the right is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nAnd inconsiderate (among a lot of other expletives that I had better not mention) for your expectation that a nine year old provides a free dog sitting service and be responsible for the welfare of a pet. \n\nThe dog should have been restrained in some way that prevented their immediate exit from the vehicle when the door was opened.\n\nOr better yet, the owner should have taken on the care of their own animal? It is outlandish how entitled you both are and how oblivious you are to your own blame.\n\nMake no mistake, the blame for the situation you are currently in lies squarely on the shoulders of the adults, NOT A NINE YEAR OLD CHILD.", "YTA. she\u2019s already going to feel guilty about this probably for the rest of her life. yelling at her and guilting her does what? \n\nthe dog is your gfs responsibility not your 9yr old. of course she\u2019s going to be bored in the car while you leave her alone the whole time ?? \n\nwhy do you care more about your gf and her dog than your own daughter", "YTA.

First, its super dangerous to leave a child unattended in a car, this is how kids get kidnapped. Second, you and your GF got to get out and stretch and move around, but you expected a child to just sit there alone all day? You left a child responsible for an animal that doesnt belong to her.

Enjoy paying for her therapy later in life, if she bothers to speak to you at all.", "Reading between the lines, you wanted to visit places that don't allow dogs.

Just left a small dog in a strange area and called it a day? Dogs might be quick, but they don't run a hundred miles away from familiar people. They have pretty good hearing and they know the sound of their own name. Fairly sure that if you hadn't left the area, Sarah would still have a dog. \n\nThis turns into \"we abandoned a dog and blamed our daughter\" if you left the dog in the area without exhausting every resource to find him.

How could he be tht mad at his own daughter for a dog he doesnt even own????", "\u201cBut she had her iPad, that\u2019s BETTER than parenting\u201d /s", "Other people have said this, but 15 minutes isn't a few minutes lol", "Yeah and guess who\u2019s fault that is\u2026 the owners not the bloody child that they neglected AH", "This particular stop in the post he was talking about was for 15 minutes. We don\u2019t know how long the other stops took. \n\nAnd I\u2019d never leave my kids in the car that young for any amount of time.", "If it's illegal, it doesn't matter how dangerous you find it. It isn't a matter of \"how wrong it is\", it is a matter of it being an unnecessary risk regardless of the odds. \n\nDo you think the parents of all of the children, one of which goes missing or is abducted every 40 seconds in the United States alone, comforts themselves with the idea that they didn't think anything would happen?", "Yeah, agreeing to disagree is for pizza toppings. Not for child safety and neglecting.", "Don\u2019t reproduce", "Yes, you got lucky. The kind of people that are looking for the opportunity to take a child are frequenting places where irresponsible parents partake in these behaviors of leaving their kids alone. Gas stations, grocery stores, shopping centers.\n\nAll it takes is the right person at the right time to see an unattended child and they are gone forever or at minimum permanently traumatized.\n\nEvery single tragic story where a kid dies or gets taken starts with the exact same story, \"I just looked away for a minute\". You think that is a coincidence?\n\nThey barely ever start with. \"Well, I abandoned my kid in the woods for a week and I just can't figure out why I can't find him. Hur Dee Dur.\"", "no it wasn't only being in the same space as the dog. though even that - for five hours! - is a lot  \n\nfor five hours she was stuck in the backseat with a dog on her lap. there were multiple stops where dad and gf got out and got a chance to stretch their legs, go to the bathroom, etc. and they left her alone in the car. fully responsible for a dog which was not crated and not on a leash\n\nwhich meant that when the kid needed to get out for a minute, the dog ran off and the kid was blamed\n\nthis whole thing is bullshit and not ok at all", "She was literally told to watch the dog and was left in the car (like said dog) for that sole purpose. The comments and his behavior just makes it even more clear that this guy wasn\u2019t concerned about his kid at all, it\u2019s what she could do for them on his planned couples trip.  \n\nIn any event, it sounds like the child has a good mom so she\u2019s got that going for her at least.", "It's not a dog he's never seen and his gf is important too. Would you just be happily if anything happened ? \n\nOfc it's not the girl's fault and he was wrong in how the situation escalated and redirecing his frustration about the situation to the kid. But how could you expect for him to be happy and act like nothing happened and go on about the trip?", "I missed that part! Ugh I hate how so many people treat tablets and phones as this magic thing that will keep kids entertained til the end of time smh. Seriously, learn how to parent and stop expecting technology to be your babysitter!", "For me it is... others said it's way too much so I'm the minority. I'll live with that", "Omfg have you read somewhere I said it was the child's fault ?!?", "As I said in other comments, I've been left alone for some time in a car when I was young or even run some small errands by myself. I don't think such behavior is so bad.", "As you said tho you don't know in which state he was. So you don't know if it was illegal. \n\nAnd most kids don't get abducted while being in cars but mostly in other environments.", "Omg the exaggerations", "Ditto"]}
