Your daughter is 9 years old. What did you expect. That she would stay in the car while you all got out. Why was the dog not in a crate ? Driving with a not secured dog is not safe. What if the dog jumps on the drivers seat? And why does he just jump outside? Thats also unsafe. Train your dog!", "YTA my main issue here is you left a 9 year old girl alone in an unlocked car near a busy street! So many things could've gone wrong!\n\nIf you were worried about the dog running away why didnt you buy a doggy seatbelt?", "YTA. Not her dog. Not her responsibility. YTA for making her responsible when she\u2019s only NINE and unfamiliar with the dog and it\u2019s habits. And when she failed at an adult task (keeping the dog in the car) you were cruel to her. You could have put a leash on the dog and attached it to the seat back. You could have crated the dog. You could have taken the dog to the kennel. You set up your nine year old daughter to fail. And when she failed and needed comfort, you were cruel to her.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. Why are you leaving your 9-year-old daughter in the car alone? Why do you guys get to stretch your legs and see things and she doesn't? Why couldn't you all get out (with the puppy on a leash)? \n\nAnd last, but not least, WHY WAS THE 9-YEAR-OLD LEFT IN CHARGE OF AN UNTRAINED PUPPY WHEN THERE WERE 2 FULLY CAPABLE ADULTS (ONE OF WHOM IS THE OWNER OF THE DOG)??? Did you plan this trip for the weekend your daughter was there just so you could have a built-in puppy sitter?\n\nYou were thinking only of yourself and gave no consideration to your DAUGHTER. As a dog owner I do feel sorry for your girlfriend, I would be inconsolable if my dog ran away but you guys are the adults and responsibility ultimately falls on you, not the literal child.", "How did a stop at a gas station for a drink and bathroom take 15 minutes? Why are you taking a road trip with a dog and small child if they have to stay in the car on most stops? I have so many questions.\n\nYTA. She is 9. You left her unsupervised. It sounds like it was an accident. It would have avoidable if you planned a trip around a 9 year old and a dog instead of just repeatedly abandoning them in a car.", "Wow YTA. She\u2019s nine. There a few things. \n1. Why the actual hell would it be a good idea to leave a nine year old alone in the car\n2. Why would you give her sole responsibility of the dog, she\u2019s nine. \n3. Nine year olds get bored, don\u2019t just leave her alone and expect her to be occupied, maybe she got scared and wanted to find you. \n4. She didn\u2019t do this with any malicious intent, this is all negligence on your part. \n\nYTA to the max. Apologize and hope she forgives you.", "YTA 1. Why could one of you stay with your daughter or she comes with you, 2. Why giving her the responsibility and 3. Scolding her. YTA and then the worst not hugging her. How awful are you, she is your daughter!!!!! And it sounds like she was in the way of you and your gf trip even though it was your daughter's weekend with you. shame on you also she was already upset about the dog. Great way to make her feel worse YTA", "YTA\n\nAnyone else think this is the same troll with the foster child?\n\nGet back under your bridge, troll.", "Info: So you wanted your 9yo to go running around in traffic after a dog that was probably really fast and she wouldn\u2019t be able to catch? \n\nYeah it wasn\u2019t smart of her to open the door, but the fact you wouldn\u2019t even hug her or say goodbye was mean. She didn\u2019t let the dog out intentionally.", "YTA. \n\nYou made your nine year solely responsible for your girlfriend's dog on a \"road trip\" and left her alone in the vehicle repeatedly for \"stops\" you had to make. This wasn't a road trip. It was an errand day where you made your kid the dog sitter. She told you she was bored. She told you she wanted out of the car. At the last stop you could have waited in the car with the dog while your girlfriend used the toilet and could have gotten your kid a drink and let her stretch her legs for a bit. \n\nAlso, why did the dog need to be on Emily's lap the entire time? Sarah should have been caring for her dog while in the car. Not the nine year old. \n\nYour last part is the worst. You used your kid and then treated her terribly because two irresponsible adults gave her a responsibility she wasn't ready for. You are more worried about Sarah's feelings than those of your child.", "YTA\n\nLeaving your kid in the car is neglect and can get you arrested already, but you literally just towed her along in the car all day? Like what is actually wrong with you.\n\nGet. A. Vasectomy. \n\nStop being a selfish parent and put your kid first.", "YTA. You made multiple stops & left your 9yo in the car alone. Those stops ensured you & Sarah were getting out and stretching and breaking the monotony of a trip, but when your 9 year old CHILD showed signs of being antsy and expressed boredom, you told her that's what she signed up for. Wtf. YOU planned this trip for a weekend she was there. This is all on you. Any child who has already expressed boredom and being antsy would have eventually opened a door to get out with you at one of your multiple pit stops.\n\nThen, to top it off, you denied her any affection or reassurance...over a dog. You just showed her (probably not the 1st time) that your girlfriend is more important than her, and she will not forget it. You & your girlfriend aren't wanting to be parents, obviously - your daughter will be better off staying with her mom & you going to live your life without her. It's what you're doing now, but she'll be better off emotionally in the long run to not be there for it.", "Yta. So you and girlfriend wanted to make stops while your daughter just sat in car with the dog. Why didn\u2019t Sarah take your daughter inside the store as well to use the restroom. Why did someone have to stay in the car the entire time with the dog? If Emily never went on the trip then what would have happened to the dog, who would have watched the dog while making all these stops? So many questions and yta for putting that responsibility on a 9 year old and being an inconsiderate father.", "YTA and if you don't see why I'm thinking nothing I can say can convince you otherwise", "YTA. Your girlfriend's dog is her *own responsibility,* not your 9-year-old daughter's. I'm sure your daughter would have liked to get out of the car and move around like you and your girlfriend during a road trip, but instead you made her stay cooped up in the car the entire time. \n\nAnd I'm sure your daughter feels terrible about the dog and you're just piling on more guilt by refusing to acknowledge her. You and your girlfriend are extremely selfish and irresponsible and you both need to grow up.", "her dog, her duty, nobody else's.\n\nimagine 2 adults too incompetent to put a leash on a dog and then scolding a 9-year-old....\n\nyta", "YTA.  A 9 year old girl (or the dog) should ever be left alone in a car out of your eyesight.  What happens when some stranger comes along and kidnaps her.  And then your reaction after to not even hug her.  Are you 12?  You need parenting classes and you need to apologize to her.", "YTA! You're acting like she did it on purpose! She's a 9 year old KID! You broke your kids heart because of an accident! Congrats! Once she's 18 you'll never hear from her again because you and your girlfriend are irresponsible!", "YTA.", "YTA and the dog getting lost is your and Sarah's fault. I would not for a minute consider leaving a child in charge of my dog, especially a child that has expressed being bored and already getting restless. You guys are the dumbest couple. And you're leaving both in the car on all these stops? And dogs need to get out too, not just Emily. Then you blame her and end the trip early, don't even show affection, you have traumatized the poor girl and she'll always remember this. And why? Because a grown woman can't stay behind to watch her dog or carry it in like countless other small dog owners do? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA! You left a CHILD responsible for a dog that isn\u2019t even hers. So many things wrong with this entire story. Sounds like your daughter is a major inconvenience to you. Start putting your child first OP.", "YTA. Emily didn't do anything to Sarah's dog. Emily was stuck in the car for a road trip for FIVE HOURS and is 9. You wouldn't even let her step out for a minute? Put the leash on the dog and go for a quick walk? She's literally 9, how can you expect her to be patient and stay in the CAR for FIVE HOURS? What if she needed to use the bathroom? Wanted a snack? Or literally just wanted to stretch her legs? I have taken 6 hour drives as an adult and there's no way I wouldn't have wanted to get my self out of that car. She let the dog out by accident, who cares? She's 9, she's bored out of her mind, she might not have ever been responsible for a dog before without parental supervision. She did nothing wrong and the fact that you wouldn't even hug her is awful. Mistakes happen. Mistakes happen even more often when you're this unfair to your 9 year old.", "YTA. If you take a road trip as a family, it\u2019s exactly that, AS A FAMILY. You don\u2019t repeatedly leave your 9 year old in the car while you and your new girlfriend go check things out. This is straight up neglect and if I was your daughters mother, I\u2019d be going to court to ensure you lose custody.", "YTA. Pets are ultimately an adult responsibility. Anything that happens to a dog in these situations is the adults responsibility. They can\u2019t mentally make adult decisions like look after the dog at all times.

Their brains literally can\u2019t.\n\nHope you guys find the dog.", "INFO: Are you the father describing putting your 9-year-old child into a position of responsibility for watching your girlfriend\u2019s pet while you went on a road trip with your girlfriend, and left that child alone in the car with the dog for a quarter of an hour??", "This whole post was just made to anger people. The account was made today and the reasons OP gives are stupid.", "YTA - you took your 9 year old kid on a road trip and then made her stay in the care alone for the majority of it \n\nThen after what was probably a really stressful and intense situation, you completely ignore her, and don\u2019t even hug or kiss her goodbye, which to an upset 9 year old means you don\u2019t love her anymore\n\n\nEmily didn\u2019t do anything to the dog, it was an accident, its your fault for leaving a nine year old spine in a car repeatedly when she said she was bored, she just have felt suffocated \nJesus Christ", "YTA, you left your 9 year old daughter alone in the car for nearly 15 minutes,   luckily she wasn't kidnapped while you were abandoning her. The fact you think you are in the right is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nAnd inconsiderate (among a lot of other expletives that I had better not mention) for your expectation that a nine year old provides a free dog sitting service and be responsible for the welfare of a pet. \n\nThe dog should have been restrained in some way that prevented their immediate exit from the vehicle when the door was opened.\n\nOr better yet, the owner should have taken on the care of their own animal? It is outlandish how entitled you both are and how oblivious you are to your own blame.\n\nMake no mistake, the blame for the situation you are currently in lies squarely on the shoulders of the adults, NOT A NINE YEAR OLD CHILD.", "YTA. she\u2019s already going to feel guilty about this probably for the rest of her life. yelling at her and guilting her does what? \n\nthe dog is your gfs responsibility not your 9yr old. of course she\u2019s going to be bored in the car while you leave her alone the whole time ?? \n\nwhy do you care more about your gf and her dog than your own daughter", "YTA. Congratulations, she\u2019ll probably stop wanting to hang with you. You\u2019re the worst.", "YTA. You are the parent and you did not parent. You planned an adult road trip and dragged your 9 year old along because it didn't occur to you to do it on a different weekend.

You are a huge AH.", "YTA. You left your 9 year old child alone in the car. And responsible for the dog. So many things could of gone wrong and you\u2019re lucky only the dog is gone.", "YTA. and a garbage father. First, its super dangerous to leave a child unattended in a car, this is how kids get kidnapped. Second, you and your GF got to get out and stretch and move around, but you expected a child to just sit there alone all day? You left a child responsible for an animal that doesnt belong to her. On a trip you planned. On HER time with you. And to top off the shit show, you neglected your childs needs because you were mad at a situation YOU created. Stellar parenting really. Enjoy paying for her therapy later in life, if she bothers to speak to you at all.", "Reading between the lines, you wanted to visit places that don't allow dogs.  For whatever reason, you decided not to hire a dog-sitter or leave the dog at a kennel.

Should have left the dog at home.\nYou have probably strained your relationship with your daughter and that could be permanent.", "Uh...point of order, where the hell is the dog??\n\nSo you just wandered around looking for a bit and then went home? Just left a small dog in a strange area and called it a day? Dogs might be quick, but they don't run a hundred miles away from familiar people. They have pretty good hearing and they know the sound of their own name. Fairly sure that if you hadn't left the area, Sarah would still have a dog. \n\nThis turns into \"we abandoned a dog and blamed our daughter\" if you left the dog in the area without exhausting every resource to find him.

The dog  should have also been on a leash or secured ( they make attachments for Seatbelts designed for pets ) with doors opening all the time for stops.

Her parents told us they were gonna stop to \"pee\" and \"grab a snack\"  and for us  to stay in the car. \n\nThey went inside a steakhouse and had a two hour dinner alone while we had to stay outside in the car by ourselves wondering WTF was going on \n\nYES, op's story doesn't add up", "Sorry just saw your post now, posted the same thought above.", "Fuck.  I'm an adult and I'd be bored sitting  in the car that long waiting for someone.\n\nYTA  , your a big asshole.\n\nI feel sorry for your daughter", "Also, the gas station was a 'quick' stop after they'd already made a 'few' stops that she'd already complained about getting bored for. I'm wondering how long she'd been sitting in that car for while they ran errands ... and the rule of thumb for road trips is that if you stop you ask \\*everyone\\* in the car if they have to go to the bathroom, especially children and pets, otherwise you'll have to stop again sooner than necessary. \n\nThis whole thing screams that he planned a nice trip for him and his girlfriend and it was 'lucky' that the kid was there to mind the dog.", "I bet those stop were the \u201csightseeing\u201d stops on their trip and daughter was brought along just so she could dog sit.", "5 hours apparently, found it in a comment", "Op purposely planned the trip on his weekend with his daughter. He never had to even do that. He asked her to go. \n\nI also have an issue with him being so resentful towards her that even after he dropped her off he wouldn\u2019t hug her or tell her bye. Who doesn\u2019t hug their kid bye when they leave them??? \n\nPart of me feels like he was catering more towards his gf than his daughter who didn\u2019t even ask to come. He didn\u2019t get her out of the car for anything, used his kid as a dog sitter and was just so angry that his gf was hurt about her dog. I have a feeling gf was mad and upset and he took her and his anger out on his kid. \n\nHow often does he even have his kid ?? Does OP even know how to be a parent\u2026", "Which is crazy, they could have taken the trip another weekend as it didn't seem urgent they just needed to get away.    That said makes you wonder if he wanted his daughter there as a dog sitter.", "Which is crazy, because she *didn\u2019t* have to come along! *They planned it for the weekend he has her!*", "Why didn\u2019t they do the trip when the 9 year old was at her moms?", "Father of 3 daughters here, I audibly gasped when he said he didn't hug her goodbye or talk to her. So much bad parenting going on here. FIFTEEN minutes for a pit stop with the 9 year old alone in the car?! Of course she was bored and probably tired of looking after an adult's dog. WTF OP?!\n\nYTA times 1000", "Well, he's probably not getting laid tonight, so.\n\nLittle girl probably has more emotional intelligence (and the regular sort too, I suspect) than her daddy already.", "I was thinking that but then I was like it cost me $20 on Rover for dog sitter so that can't be it. Honestly I hope Mom is a Reddit reader and he loses visitation.", "Every time mine got out I was beside myself. I always got her back pretty quickly with the help of neighbors (she never suspects them!) but every time I'm shaken up for a good while afterwards.\n\nI can't imagine how it felt to the poor kiddo! Kids feel emotions far stronger than adults do since they're bad at regulating them, and then to be *blamed* for the incident and *denied comfort and affection* by her father. That's traumatic, hands down. I promise you she will never forget about this, and will probably suffer mental anguish from it for a very long time. Poor things have sad excuses for guardians.", "I don\u2019t think he wanted to take her at all really. But since he had to, might as well make her babysit a puppy. That way, since the puppy wasn\u2019t in a carrier or anything, it would clearly be the little girl\u2019s fault if it peed in the car. /S", "My thought exactly. He said they chose a weekend when he knew he would have her then followed up with the fact that the dog had to come too. He made it clear he wasn\u2019t including her in any of the \u201cstops\u201d they were making on the trip. There\u2019s zero reason to plan to bring her except for if he\u2019s planning for her to stay in the car with the dog.\n\nYTA OP I\u2019d say get an actual pet sitter next time, but unfortunately, do to your own terrible parenting choices and the fact that your an selfish AH, you no longer have a pet.", "How down bad do you have to be that you can't hold off for one weekend with a child?", "Or drugs. Could be drugs. That would explain a lot about them.", "I hope not.  Neither OP nor Sarah should be reproducing or attempting to reproduce.", "Klassy!", "Yes, why so many stops?  This is just weird!  What a couple of AHs!", "Honestly I\u2019m thinking some sort of drugs, maybe weed, maybe something else, but something is off with this story I agree.", "Yea and why isn\u2019t the kid coming in for a bathroom break?", "There are just so many drink options! How was he supposed to choose between the thirty eight varieties of Monster available in under 15 mins? /s", "My mother was a wheelchair user who could do a rest stop in 10 minutes including getting the chair out of a stuffed car, transferring into it, transferring from chair to toilet, transferring back, and getting the wheelchair back in the car so. Yeah.", "I bet he planned to take the trip on a weekend he had his daughter just so the daughter could dog sit.", "If I was Emily\u2019s mom, I\u2019d be looking at getting sole custody. OP doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s capable of being a mature, responsible, or loving father. Emily deserves better. \n\nThen OP and the oh-so-lovely sounding Sarah can have all the gas station quickies they want. \n\nYTA OP.", "Very good questions! And he even mentions that him and his gf made several stops where his daughter had to stay in the car and watch the dog. And that she was told that she has to stay in the car and watch the dog while they do whatever\u2026. \n\n\nMy family and I enjoy having long car trips. We also have a dog. My son is 10 and we have a rule that we stop every 2 hours to stretch our legs and so on. I wouldn\u2019t ever expect my son to stay in the car and watch our dog! Or leave him alone in the car in a parking lot or gas station. I would think that his daughter was taken on that trip as a free dog sitter\u2026 \n\nI do feel sorry for the poor child. Unfortunately she has an irresponsible father. \nOP, You are a Massive A!!!", "Only adults and humans have to pee or stretch their legs. -OP probably", "Needed a free dog sitter", "They needed a dog sitter while they went at it in petrol station toilets \ud83e\udd2e", "I have a daughter and a son... And an ex with an attitude/personality that reminds me of OP. \n\nHis girlfriend will probably wise up and leave having \"only\" lost a dog but his daughter is stuck having to spend time with a person actively robbing her of an emotionally healthy childhood.", "I'd guess she knows him well, considering she isn't with him anymore.", "I am thankful that my pup has only ever gotten out one time. He's a semi-retired service dog so he knows better but I think he has just gotten old and probably had no idea that he wouldn't be able to find his way home when he took off. He just about leaped out of my neighbor's arms when she finally drove up. \n\nAs a kid, I was blamed for lots of shit that wasn't my fault, but OP set this kid up for failure.", "Honestly,  drugs sounds a hell of a lot more likely.  I'm honestly surprised no one else has mentioned it.\nEdited for spelling", "And like...did they take the dog out for a potty break at any of these stops? Small wonder it hopped out the first chance it got, it was probably busting for a piss!", "He says it was a road trip to help them relax. It sounds to me, from the info given, that they were out having fun while they left the poor child in the car", "This is what was mystifying me as well, the child was not given breaks at all? It sounds like a long time for a kid that age to be in the car without their own break. \nI", "This!!! \u2b06\ufe0f. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "she could have also went to the toilet and bought the drink after while op stayed in the car. no need for both of them to leave for so long either way. im really interested to know what these 'few stops' before were that they had to make and what their plans were that actually included the dog and child", "Yeah, I\u2019m really confused by all the stops. Were they running errands before the trip actually started or were they trying to win an award for longest road trip ever?!", "I think it is both.", "Having a dad who can\u2019t stand you while forcing a short vacation on you has to be awful. Having a dad who prioritizes his girlfriend over you is terrible. My mother was just like this and couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of us. Her mom NEEDS full custody. I wonder if the only reason she sees her father is Bc he is legally required to see her? I bet if he lost his weekends then he would hardly even call.", "Why did the dog even need a dog sitter to begin with. Is it not common knowledge that you can get things to strap your dog safely in the car ? To where they can\u2019t get up front and potentially hit something. Betting the GF didn\u2019t want the kid to go at all and was probably aggravated about it.", "Another wise choice on mom\u2019s part.", "Didn't take much to figure out why the mom divorced him. She must hate having to let her daughter go on those required weekends with the father.", "My first thought was standard road trip stops--parks, World's 3rd Largest Ball of Twine, cheezy concrete and fiberglass dinosaurs, etc. Which would make it especially cruel, because that stuff is only fun when you're 9. \n\nDrugs/alcohol and quickies were my second thought.", "And why did the dog HAVE to go with them?!? And why do the road trip on HER weekend with the dad?!?  I have a 10 year old and I won\u2019t leave her in the car alone to run in for a coffee let alone a bathroom break !", "That\u2019s exactly what this sounded like to me. It sounds like they went antiquing or something and just dragged the kid along because it happened to be his weekend when they decided to go. They should\u2019ve done it on a weekend that the girl was at her mothers, because this doesn\u2019t sound like a fun trip for the kid at all. \n\n\u201cI told her you knew what you were in for.\u201d  Did the kid get a choice?? WTF?", "Haha yeah taking a holiday because they are stressed. Proceeds to do errands and other random junk instead of relaxing and heading to their destination.", "Tbf, I am somewhat baffled by the whole post. And angry at OP on behalf of his daughter\u2026 \n\nObviously OP and gf didn\u2019t bother to much to make sure that the dog was safe to begin with.  \nAnd most likely you are right when you say that op\u2019s gf didn\u2019t want op\u2019s daughter there.", "And the puppy for potty time. They have bladders too.", "They did it that way on purpose, so the 9 year old could sit with the dog when they went places the dog wasn\u2019t allowed. I guarantee that was the plan all along.", "That\u2019s just disgusting."]}
