My parents immediately rushed to coddle her and help her and her now husband Mike (33m) with everything. She continued college while my parents paid for everything she and her child would need. Mike worked with my dad as an intern at his company while also continuing going to college and this continued even after she gave birth. My parents would watch her kid until she or Mike came home and I always found that to be very unfair on my parents. \n\nWell after college May and Mike got married and had two more kids (twins 4f) and they have great lives. They both work late hours some times so my mom or day will watch the kids until either one comes home. I again think this is unfair and absolutely hate how they are using my parents as free babysitters. It's uncool in my opinion. \n\nWell my parents decided to visit my aunt in another state and left Tuesday. I was happy about this because this will force my sister to grow up and learn that she can't use our parents the way she does. Well that didn't happen because she asked me if I could watch the twins for an hour until Mike comes home while she takes Reece to the hospital after she hurt herself. I immediately told her no and told her to find someone else. \n\nShe was disappointed and then spent a half an hour on the phone asking everyone she knew if they could watch the twins. Everyone said what I said and she nearly broke down crying when she looks at me. She began begging and telling me she'll even pay me for watching them just this once. I again told her no and that they are her kids and she needs to finally grow up and actually watch them. She said nothing and quickly got the kids out and in the car before driving off. \n\nAn hour later I was called by my mom and she was telling me how disappointed she was in me and how family helps family. I said they do but I refuse to coddle May the way she and dad did, that May needs to grow up and watch her own kids. Mom said nothing before hanging up. So AITA for refusing to babysit?\n\nEdit: I have been seeing this question a lot so I\u2019ll answer everyone here. My parents have never complained about watching the kids, they actually offer to watch them most times so my sister and her husband don\u2019t have to pay for daycare. My sister also has never asked me to watch them until now.", "created_utc": 1697219706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1774k57/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_nieces/", "score": 2119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My Aunt convinced my sister that she was ruining my mom\u2019s retirement and health by taking my mom up on the offer. Long story short my sister bc of this found a daycare for her kids, my mom was devastated when my sister told her and called all of us crying asking us if we knew what she did to cause my sister to do this.

I can understand this, but it's something you should seek therapy for so you're not holding onto this anger.\n\nYou didn't say how seriously your oldest niece was hurt, but if it warranted a hospital visit, I can imagine it was pretty serious. Your sister needed to be there for her oldest daughter, which I can imagine was extremely hard having her 4 year old twins with her as well.

But it sounds like your parents help out so your sister & BIL can work & provide for themselves & their family, which is perfectly fine if your parents agree to it.

Other people may make different choices. It\u2019s very normal to me that someone would go \u201coh my child needs to go to the hospital. Let me see if someone else can watch my other two while I take them\u201d even if it isn\u2019t an ambulance worthy emergency. Because while I do not like the vast majority of small children, I would 100% watch any of my friends\u2019 kids in that situation. Heck, I\u2019d watch the majority of my coworkers\u2019 kids if I was available in that situation!", "My mother in law watched my daughter for the first nearly 5 years of her life. Then my MIL got diagnosed with cancer and unfortunately passed. I am so grateful that my daughter has those memories with her grandma. Even if she was so young. I never worried about my daughter when I was at work. I knew she was loved and cared for. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything wrong with grandparents watching their grandkids, if they want to", "Yup, key would work but control panel wouldn\u2019t. Good thing I had the door open when it did and I wasn\u2019t out or I would\u2019ve been screwed if I didn\u2019t have the car seat in my car already.", "Me too. I'm not even a kid person and I'd do it for someone who's in dire straits because of a medical emergency. If I didn't, it would actually kind of bug me.", "Happy Cake Day \ud83e\udd17", "Some people actually have loving non-toxic relationships with their families?!? That's crazy talk! (/s)", "There was a single car accident in front of my house a few years ago. The driver fell asleep, hit the curb, and the vehicle ended up on its top. (How the two adults and two young children didn\u2019t have more than bruises is inexplicable.) It was January and cold, so I took the kids in while the parents talked with police and waited for the tow truck.  I could *never* imagine not helping when kids are involved.   \n\n\nOP is unbelievably judgmental of her sister and her parent, as well as very selfish.", "Same here (well children who are vaguely friends with my son who's parents I recognise in the street). The dad took ill with gallstones and needed to go to a&e (20 min from here), mum messaged me via my son if the kids could come over. The boys ended up staying the night and had a great, if noisy time. Dad was fine after some minor surgery and mum and I are pretty good friends now.", "It's like she was waiting for the moment when her parents were gone and she could flip the table and didn't register that this was a completely different situation that doesn't get across the point she was hoping to triumphantly make.", "The members in that accident only had bruises because they likely didn\u2019t realize there would be an accident so they didn\u2019t have time to think about it and tense up or brace themselves. It\u2019s the same reason drunks who get into accidents often come out of them with very little injury. The majority of the time, when someone tenses/tries to brace/or otherwise \u201cavoid\u201d an accident is when severe injuries happen. \n\nIt\u2019s a similar principle when falling. A healthy adult who falls and doesn\u2019t have time to brace will often just have contusions, someone who puts out an arm or hand to break their fall may break their hand or arm."]}
