My parents immediately rushed to coddle her and help her and her now husband Mike (33m) with everything. She continued college while my parents paid for everything she and her child would need. Mike worked with my dad as an intern at his company while also continuing going to college and this continued even after she gave birth. My parents would watch her kid until she or Mike came home and I always found that to be very unfair on my parents. \n\nWell after college May and Mike got married and had two more kids (twins 4f) and they have great lives. They both work late hours some times so my mom or day will watch the kids until either one comes home. I again think this is unfair and absolutely hate how they are using my parents as free babysitters. It's uncool in my opinion. \n\nWell my parents decided to visit my aunt in another state and left Tuesday. I was happy about this because this will force my sister to grow up and learn that she can't use our parents the way she does. Well that didn't happen because she asked me if I could watch the twins for an hour until Mike comes home while she takes Reece to the hospital after she hurt herself. I immediately told her no and told her to find someone else. \n\nShe was disappointed and then spent a half an hour on the phone asking everyone she knew if they could watch the twins. Everyone said what I said and she nearly broke down crying when she looks at me. She began begging and telling me she'll even pay me for watching them just this once. I again told her no and that they are her kids and she needs to finally grow up and actually watch them. She said nothing and quickly got the kids out and in the car before driving off. \n\nAn hour later I was called by my mom and she was telling me how disappointed she was in me and how family helps family. I said they do but I refuse to coddle May the way she and dad did, that May needs to grow up and watch her own kids. Mom said nothing before hanging up.

Watching a child while their mother takes someone to the hospital isn't \"coddling\" them, good lord.", "YTA\n\nWhy do you care so much that your parents babysit their grandkids? They seem fine with the arrangement. No one's coddling May. \n\nYou're the only person upset about the babysitting. Because you're upset you refused to help in an emergency.", "YTA.\n\nYou talk a lot about it being unfair for your parents, but they are two grown-ups who can make their own decisions, and they decided to help their daughter take care of her family - their grandkids. That's not them being forced to do anything; that is them making a choice to do what makes them happy. \n\nI think deep down you know that, so what I think it really boils down to is jealously. You're jealous May has a happy life? Kids? Attention from Mom and Dad? Are you resentful of the things she has that you do not? Is that why you think that her having a support network to help her means she hasn't \"grown up\" and why you feel like you need to teach her a lesson? \n\nYou really need to do some critical thinking about *why* you're behaving like a spoiled, petulant child, before you completely alienate every person in your family.", "INFO\n\n> she asked me if I could watch the twins for an hour until Mike comes home\n\n> She was disappointed and then spent a half an hour on the phone\n\n> She said nothing and quickly got the kids out and in the car before driving off.\n\nWhere the heck is this taking place?

Why do you have such a problem with your parents helping out with their grandkids? It's their decision, presumably if they wanted to be less involved they would be. They're not being abused or exploited, they're adults, your resentment is misplaced.\n2. You decided to \"teach your sister a lesson\" when (checks notes) one of her children was hurt and she needed to *take them to the hospital*? If you literally couldn't help her because of another commitment, that'd be one thing, but you did this out of spite when your family actually needed you.\n\nYou're 28 and seem uncontrollably bitter and resentful towards your sister.

God you must be exhausting to deal with.", "YTA it was an emergency and she needed to talk her child to the hospital. She offered to pay you too.", "Yta\n\nThey aren't forcing you parents to watch the kids, no where in the story does it say your parents don't want to watch them either. \n\nSounds like your parents were super happy to be grandparents, and wanted to spoil them, then you got hella jealous. \n\nYou added on a couple dozen extra ah points with being happy that your sister would have to \"grow up\" when she was facing an emergency, when you are the one the needs to grow up. \n\nYou don't need to watch her kids, you could have just said no and went about your day, but you boarder on sadistic.", "YTA\n\nIt was a family medical emergency.", "YTA.

You have completely undermined yourself and your credibility in what may be a good, broader point about taking responsibility for her own kids.\n\nAlso, you don't mention whether your parents are happy with the arrangement.

Do it, but another time. You are her sister, and you were apparently available, so why not help? Because you purposefully wanted to be a dick\n\nFrom what you described, it seems both your sister and her husband work to try and provide for their children, and they sometimes use the help of your parents to look after the children during certain inconveniences\n\nThere is no reason in the world to act the way you did", "YTA. You literally said she had an emergency and you just dont care? I cant wait for you to be hated for being so cold hearted.", "First as a grandmother I love watching anytime anywhere, no such thing as too much when it\u2019s a grandbaby, maybe your parents feel the same, second you\u2019re a shitty aunt and sister, saying no is perfectly fine for most things, this was an emergency YTA hella", "YTA.\n\nYou should try working out your jealousy issues with a licensed professional instead of punishing your sister during a *medical emergency.*", "YTA...you sound jealous of sis", "I think you chose the wrong moment to take a stance.  Plus,  it's your parents choice to provide that much assistance so while you see it as taking advantage, it's up to them to say no.", "In THIS situation-100% ass. \n\nIn a situation I only want to take Kid X with me shopping watch the others for me-NTA. \n\nClearly at 28 your parents failed to tell you the difference.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, many, many grandparents provide free child care for their grandchildren. This is extremely common, and isn't \"uncool\". If you parents have an issue with the amount of time your sister asks of them, that is between them and your sister, and has nothing to do with you.\n\nNow as for you, obviously you are not obligated to provide free, or paid, child care when your parents are unavailable. But in this specific instance it doesn't sound like it was a typical situation where your sis just wanted you to sub in for what your parents usually do. No, in this case one of the kids was injured and had to be taken to the hospital, and yet you had no sympathy and refused to watch the other kids for only an hour. Now *that* is uncool.", "YTA and I think there's a lot of long-buried resentment towards your sister here.", "Yeah, YTA\n\nWhether or not to watch the kids is your *parents* decision, not yours. Whether you think it's fair or not isn't your business.\n\nThere's also a world of difference between your sister asking you to watch her twins while she takes her older daughter to the hospital to get an injury looked at and her asking you to watch them while she goes somewhere \"fun\".", "> jealous\n\nYyyup.

She knew this and came to their house to ask me. None of us live together.", "Yep. YTA. Emergencies are one of the few times you should always be willing to \u201cdrop everything.\u201d", "I agree with a lot of this. There is nothing wrong with a family member asking for help in an emergency situation.  This wasn't the parents ducking out for a night on the town. If that was the case then sure it's fine to not help. It even would be fine to not help in the emergency situation. But the way you went about it is pure AH behavior."]}
