Also, why would it matter if you had some suggestive pictures done? you guys had been married at the time.  I mean is it unheard of for a married couple to do such things?

It was an honest mistake.\n\nIf you have such open communication with your ex, then the least he should have done is to give you a heads-up that his wife was going to call you about the photos, what she saw and what she didn't. \n\nInstead, what actually happened is that she found Set 1 and was upset that he kept them, then called you to get info about the photos, perhaps not even serious about getting some done, but as an excuse to call.\n\nHe dug himself a hole.

Second,   how on earth were you supposed to know that he only showed her one set? You had just been blindsided with the fact that he shared them at all.
