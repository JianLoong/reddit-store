I think it\u2019s your Dad you really want to yell at, because as much as it\u2019s easier to blame a stranger you don\u2019t like for him not paying child support and not being interested, she had no financial power over him and couldn\u2019t have stopped him sending money to his kids.

But, you obviously still have a relationship with your Dad who cheated on your mother, left the family and didn't support you?

Next time make her piss her pants that little Wussy", "You my good friend are a MAJOR NTA! Good for you to say what was on your mind. If more people said things to call people out for bad behavior then maybe a few less AHoles would be walking around today less clueless as to how their actions and words harm people.

It was hard as a teenager to find out about the affair, and then -- after your family broke up -- to have her move into your home. \n\nYou have alot of anger built up from the above. Her attempt to politely socialize with you are like a slap in the face given what she did, causing the anger to boil over. \n\nYour reaction may have been harsh, but understandable in the circumstances. She should have known better than to attempt small talk with you given the role she played in upending your life.", "Imagine faking nice to someone you don\u2019t like and will likely not have to run into again.

She is just mad that she can't destroy people's lives without consequences.", "NTA, truth hurts, good for you!", "You needed to get that out for your own mental health. It has obviously been bothering you. I feel like this was a little bit of closure for you. Don\u2019t second guess yourself. You owe her nothing including respect. Move on.

Maybe but, honestly, fuck homewreckers and their shitty ways. She deserved it.", "Society says to be nice to everyone, even if it means not being true to ourselves.

Escalating wasn't, even though she was the one who was pushing. It put your friend in a bad spot and also made you look like the jerk.\n\nIn the future, just say, \"I don't have anything to say to you,\" and then if the other person keeps pushing for conversation, ignore them. You can even be petty and loudly tell whoever you're with that you'll need to request a different table because this person is harassing you (petty only because of volume, extra petty if you call them a stranger).\n\nDon't get me wrong, though, I understand why you responded the way you did. If you were alone, I probably wouldn't even call you an asshole, though it would still be more escalation than necessary.", "NTA. She can go fuck herself, she ruined your family and now she thinks it\u2019s fine to act like nothing happened? She can take her \u2018polite\u2019 approach and shove it up her ass.", "Fafo.\nAnd she found out.", "NTA - haha. I guess the truth hurts", "NTA. I think politeness went out the window when she decided to get it on with your dad.", "NTA, because the biggest asshole in this situation is your dad.", "NTA. You have no obligation to be her friend or even civil to her.", "NTA. If she wanted civility she should have treated you with that as a Child. She wanted forgiveness without apology.", "NTA, it was an authentic and valid reaction. She approached you, she gets what she gets. I think for women (I'm a woman) it's so outside the acceptable norm to tell anyone to fuck themselves. But... she deserved it. I can see your wife's POV and yours.\n\nMy one caution is that you did this to the mom of someone that you don't have hard feelings for, in front of them. So this poor guy is going to have to pick up the pieces. It might have been the kinder thing (to him) to just say \"Lady, I have nothing nice and polite to say to you. I am glad to see your son, but your relationship with my dad ruined my childhood, and you know it. Next time just walk on by. This conversation is over.\" Or something that gets the same point across without allowing her to feel victimized by your anger.", "You sound unhinged. In what world is this behavior okay?

She isn't worth behaving so lowly.", "NTA- oh man, if I ever get a chance to speak to the person who encouraged my parent to abandon me I probably would not have been able to verbally summarize my emotions as well as you did.\n\n100 NTA You got to speak out in a way that you couldn't as a child.

Was it cathartic, I would think so.", "NTA", "NTA", "I don't think you should create a scene when there are other innocent people there, like your \"step brother\" and your friend you were having lunch with, who will just be embarrassed by the whole thing.

So soft YTA for voting purposes, although I understand why you did it.", "NTA and from a woman who would be your mom in this story... if one of my daughters did this to their ex-stepmom, I'd throw them a f\\*cking party to celebrate.  I know my kids have years of pent up anger that arises sporadically (they have a therapist), and when the top blows - it blows. I'd be fine with a public FU to her should it occur. My only rule was not at their grandfather's funeral (we all recently attended).  I personally feel like while your reaction may have been extreme, it was likely not unwarranted.", "She made you lose your cool.

Forget it. NTA.", "NTA because she could've kept her mouth shut and then nothing would've ever been said.  She made that choice.", "EHS. She has no right to talk to you like nothing had happened before, which makes her TA. However, it wasn't the place nor the time to pull something like that off. It's extremely childish", "nahh theres no need to be nice to people who fuck part of your life up. There would be no freedom of speech if we had to always be nice", "NTA maybe not the best to do it in a public place, and create a scene there, but that being said she fucking deserved to be told to go fuck herself", "You made a scene in public for no reason. You were aggressive and cussing at her from the start. It\u2019s been years. Totally uncalled for. YTA.", "Obviously you are the asshole.", "NTA, and you're my hero.

NTA for sure.", "That's interesting, to me I have no time for either party but the one who's married is worse IMO. They're the one who's breaking a commitment they made. The affair partner is a huge asshole, no question, but they didn't actually promise anyone anything.", "It's weird that you would hate an unmarried \"other woman\" more than you would hate the married man who cheats.

You would think she\u2019d take a hint and not try to egg on the situation.", "Our culture of \u201cdecency\u201d has allowed AH to go unchecked for too long. People exist with a sense of entitlement because they\u2019re constantly getting away with the behavior they accuse others of.

The next time she sees the child of a home she wrecked, maybe she\u2019ll think twice about approaching them.", "Sounds like you politely avoided interacting with her until she decided to start something and then tactfully grey-rocked her until she pushed it further. NTA", "NTA, sometimes that explosion is the natural consequence to some FUBAR level behavior\u2026. Kinda reminds me of the time I blew up on my aunt when she kept pestering me to go visit her son, who molested me for basically my entire childhood, which she knew about\u2026.

Please don\u2019t speak to me ever again. Thanks\u2019\n\nAlso to not lower yourself to that level, you did nothing wrong until then in a way\u2026but I fully acknowledge you still barely did anything wrong compared to her\u2026smdh, some people are just cheaters through and through.", "It's definitely not something you should make a habit, certainly. But I think this was a long time coming.", "Eh, it happens. It\u2019s understandable that you find the woman who broke your family and then hurt your dad abhorrent. The minimum she could have done was apologize for imposing hardships on you and try to be happy with your dad. Instead, she (as you put it) \u201cfucks married men.\u201d It\u2019s not a surprise that you would be less civil to her than you would to other people. And frankly\u2026 she needs to stop looking for attention.", "Not at all, that woman is someone who ruined your childhood by distancing your father from your family and put your life thru difficulties of not having a normal father-son bond with him, just to give him a taste of his own medicine afterwards. You have every right to be mad about it.", "Nta but she could have been polite to you by NOT talking to you.

My aunt's husband cheated on her with one of their casual friends. She found it after that the friend had openly spoken with other people about actively pursuing him, repeatedly buying him drinks when she met him in order to get him drunk to be easier to convince and overall just being aggressive in her pursuit of him. \n\nThat doesn't excuse my ex-uncle for being a cheater and what he did was still terrible (he even left my aunt on the day after their wedding day, after they had thrown a big party for their entire family and friends to celebrate their love, despite having been cheating over her for years and known he was going to leave for months), but whenever I think about the woman he cheated with, I'm stunned to my core over how awful, amoral and disgusting a person she must be.", "...said nobody in this story at all.

This is not her family and who knows what he told her.", "Maybe the dad told her the typical \u201eit\u2019s over between me and my wife anyway\u201c. OP doesn\u2019t know that. He knows for sure, his dad screwed up and his dad is the one who holds responsibility for him.", "OP could have walked away.   Deciding to sit down next to his abuser was 'poking the bear'", "It's funny you think that excuses cheaters. Also:\n\n>Life was a big slap in the face for a while, and I worked through HS and college to support my mom and brother because my dad didn't think it was his problem and **my former step mother encouraged that.**\n\nShe was very well aware.
