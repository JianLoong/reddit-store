A year later he left us for her, moved a block away into her house, and shit sucked for a while.

All good in my opinion, that relationship needed to end. \n\nAnyway, she interrupted our meal and asked me how I was and I looked her in the eye and asked her what the fuck she thought she was doing. She said \"Just saying hi.\" \n\nI looked at her, and then at my former step bro. I said \"hey (step bro's name), always a pleasure to see you my friend\" (he's a civilian), shook his hand and ignored them. She tapped my arm and said \"what am I, invisible?\" and I lost it, tbh.  I looked at her and said: \"You can go fuck yourself. Don't speak to me. I don't want to talk to you, who the fuck do you think you are right now? Why on earth would you ever think I'd want to talk to you now that I don't legally have to?\" She said she was just being polite, and I asked her if she was still fucking married guys. My friend asked for the check, we left. He was cool about it, he remembers what my home life was like. But:\n\nMy brother thinks I was too harsh, my dad thinks I created drama from nothing.

Tell it like it is.", "NTA you said what you felt. Maybe it was harsher and more explosive than it needed to be but your description of her leads me to believe that no one's ever called her out for her shit, and you might as well be the person to do it.", "I'm already not big on spouses who cheat. They're scummy. I REALLY hate people who know someone is married and fucks them anyway. That is beyond gross to me. She knows what she did and wanted to act like it was just another day in the neighborhood? I'm sorry and maybe people will think I'm an asshole but anyone who does shit like that deserves to be told off for it. She should have been the one who was embarrassed and hiding her face in front of you. NTA.", "NTA. Yes, you lost your sh#t. So what?! You said things that were bottled up for years. I hope you feel better and that this was a release for you.", "Ooof. You clearly had some things to get off your chest and I\u2019m kind of glad you got a chance to but that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s appropriate for a public cafe in front of her son (who you put in a really awkward position). I think it\u2019s your Dad you really want to yell at, because as much as it\u2019s easier to blame a stranger you don\u2019t like for him not paying child support and not being interested, she had no financial power over him and couldn\u2019t have stopped him sending money to his kids. He made a free choice as an adult. If he didn\u2019t leave your mum for her it would have been someone else, if he cared about you like he should\u2019ve he would have financially supported you and no one could have stopped him. I say this as someone who has been in a similar situation, obviously you\u2019re not TA and you clearly have some things to say to your Dad (and I think you should but probably avoid meeting in a cafe!)", "NTA valid", "So, are you in contact with your dad then? He's the one who tore up your family. Don't get me wrong. I think that she's trash, too.", "I'm a bit conflicted.\nWere you unnecessary blunt ? yes.\nBut she approached you not the other way around.\nYour first response was to give her the cold shoulder and that's fine too in my book.\nShe does live in reality and knows your history with her.\nShe should have accepted the cold shoulder and leave it at that.\nShe didn't and by that she gave you the open to tell her what you did.\nLife gave you that little present and you took it.\nYou didn't have to but I can't fault you by setting that boundary bluntly and enjoy it.\nPetty? Yes\nF bomb not necessary but it's a feel good f bomb after she imploded your younger self life and now you have no obligations towards her.\n\nNTA\nShe kinda asked for it.", "NTA\n\nyou made it very obvious you didn\u2019t want to talk to her but she kept pushing it. Yes you unloaded on her in fairly spectacular fashion but she kept at you until she got a reaction so I\u2019d file it under FAFO myself.", "nta, mainly because this woman encouraged your father to not support your mother", "Yeah, it was extreme. Bet it felt good, though.\n\nNTA. But what did she expect? Delusional. Nice move with the step-brother though.", "Nope it was fair game mate NTA", "NTA. Why would she ever think approaching you was appropriate? Narcissist?", "NTA\n\nLet's some up. She fucks a married guy, gets him to walk away from his family and encourages him to not pay child support, completely ending your youth since now you had to help support a family. \n\nThe fact that all you did was yell at her shows restraint. In your place, many others, would've handed this woman a beatdown.", "YTA. All so unnecessary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He broke your family apart, no one else.", "Acting civilly towards others is always better that creating chaos.

I truly understand your feelings toward her, but this level of response was unnecessary. YTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd before people start judging otherwise, seldomly have others been in situation like this. OP has had a bad childhood and some traumas stay there, forever. Former step mother was a b...h but now wants to reach out, \"just saying hi\", like nothing ever happened. Although his father got what he deserved I don't understand why he thinks OP created drama for nothing. \n\nAll in all, OP no need to trouble your mind regarding this, and if people have a problem with it, just tell to go f..k themselves.", "NTA - But dear god do you bear resentment against those people.", "NTA, question why does it seem like you dont hold any resentment for your dad over what he did? After breaking your family and then ruining your childhood I would have gone no contact permanently.", "NTA", "NTA ---- It sounds to me like you finally got the chance to tell ex step-mother what you thought about her and you took it, good for you sometimes you really need to get something off your chest you make yourself feel just that little bit better.", "NTA, you called it for what it was and set firm boundaries for any possible future encounters.", "NTA", "I'm feeling a little bit ESH.

Let me introduce you to my friend. Friend, this is the cheater that my dad left my mom for on to have her cheat on him. Cheater, this is my friend.\n\nAll in all, I don't blame you for your feelings.

You poked the bear.  \n\nI'm saying NTA because she needed to hear it and she had no business trying to pretend there was no problem beteeen you, but you were still foolish to think that she wouldn't have done just that.\n\nSeriously: the best way to treat these people is to AVOID them.\n\nI can't help feeling you sat there because you WANTED a fight.", "Sometimes you\u2019re an asshole.
