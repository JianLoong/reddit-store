I think it\u2019s your Dad you really want to yell at, because as much as it\u2019s easier to blame a stranger you don\u2019t like for him not paying child support and not being interested, she had no financial power over him and couldn\u2019t have stopped him sending money to his kids.

Next time make her piss her pants that little Wussy", "You my good friend are a MAJOR NTA! Good for you to say what was on your mind. If more people said things to call people out for bad behavior then maybe a few less AHoles would be walking around today less clueless as to how their actions and words harm people.
