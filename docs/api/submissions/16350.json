I think it\u2019s your Dad you really want to yell at, because as much as it\u2019s easier to blame a stranger you don\u2019t like for him not paying child support and not being interested, she had no financial power over him and couldn\u2019t have stopped him sending money to his kids.

You don\u2019t get to tear up someone\u2019s life and then get the benefits of small chat/public decency in order to make yourself feel better afterwards. It clearly shows a lack of life experience to call this \u201charmless\u201d.", "The only reasonable YTA judgement I have read.", "Yes. The drama is very atmosphere-killing in a public setting. Especially peppered with all those F bombs. That is a sharp word the *everybody* can hear.", "What? \"She came looking for trouble.\"??? They were at the same restaurant by coincidence. Maybe read the story better? Here, I grabbed the literal second sentence so we can clear your confusion up since you obviously didn't read anything.\n\n\"While it was in the shop we went and got lunch at a pretty popular spot and we got sat next to my former step mother and former step brother. \"", "NTA. You needed to let it out. She deserved it.", "AITA has never ever ruled in favour of a step parent. Just saying.", "\"This poor woman\" my ass.\nThe only way she wouldve been a victim is if OP entered the resturant and immediately went off on her. Otherwise she had no business even speaking to him.", "Would you scream at her airing all your dirty laundry in a public caf\u00e9 though? Op asked if he had an embarrassing overreaction, and on balance (even though his emotions are valid) I think yes. I have never seen an adult that wasn\u2019t drunk or on drugs have a screaming meltdown in public- no matter the provocation. The fact he had the moral high ground doesn\u2019t really matter, all people saw was an adult screaming like a teenager in response to his dads ex-wife saying hi (which she had to do in public) presumably years after the fact. Every day divorced couples that have experienced devastating betrayals find a way to be civil in public and in front of their children. If ops mum has resisted the urge to scream at his dad and his former mistress in public, then I\u2019m sure he can too.", "I honestly feel like some people aren't reading the same story I have.\n\nHe was an AH before multiple attempts occurred.\n\n1. Dude sits down in restaurant next to former SM\n\nHer: Hi, how are you?\n\nHim: Hey Step bro, you're ok, you on the only hand HOW DARE YOU EVEN TALK TOME? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. WTF\n\nHer: I was just saying Hi\n\nHim EFF OFF\n\n2) Then and only then, after he escalates an awkward situation, violently, does she try to keep talking to him.  Possibly to calm him down from his public freak out\n\nThat wasn't multiple attempts at conversation\n\nI think too many people would get far too much pleasure doing the same thing in his shoes, so justify that with NTA.  Most of which who have been affected by cheating.  Or cheating is \"triggering.\"  Look, I think cheaters are disgusting too, but I would be way more pissed at my father over this than her.  Why he still talks to the dad and doesn't think she should be able to extend him a friendly hello, in public, because they were sitting right next too each and could clearly see each other, is beyond me.", "Why is everybody acting like she walked up to the table? They were seated next to each other.", "ex Step bro didn't even \"step\" in to defend his mom.... He's probably done with her antics and being dragged along to the drama she creates. I bet you he was laughing inside", "I\u2019m reporting you. They should just shut this thread down.", "I\u2019m very sorry to hear this. You didn\u2019t deserve that, and it wasn\u2019t your fault. I hope you\u2019ve found healthy ways to deal with everything since.", "To be 100% fair on the first point, the wording of the story implies that they didn't choose to sit there. It seems like they were placed there by the establishment", "Yeah, this is what I mean about people putting civility above everything else. She tried to say hi, he wasn't having it. Then after getting snubbed, she tried a second time! She wants OP to essentially play happy families.", "I truly hope you never have to experience sitting politely next to your abuser.", "She literally got into his physical space and tapped him on the arm when he was clearly ignoring her. With some passive-aggressive \"What am I, invisible?\" bullshit. If that's not instigating based on their history together, I don't know what is. In some situations that'd get you a whole lot more than just a verbal dressing down. \n\nDeep-seated hurt got the better of him for a sec.\n\nShe, on the other hand started this shit when he was 12 damn years old and clearly doesn't give a crap how he was affected by it to this day. \n\nCould he have been more polite? Maybe. But he also clearly has the decency to reflect on his own actions. That's NTA for me.\n\nHell, I'd say he's NTA even if it was a stranger. He was being VERY clear about his boundaries and she had 0 respect for them. People are literally getting shot to death for less these days.", "Because she engaged with him first while he clearly avoided any contact in the first place? Because she wrecked his family life (with obvious help from his father) and not the other way around? Because she didn\u2019t bother to try and preface her \u2018polite\u2019 hello with even a bare minimum \u201clook, I\u2019m really sorry about what happened\u201d or \u201cI hope things are going ok with you\u201d?\n\nI can\u2019t comprehend being her in that situation and not trying to avoid all contact. Actively attempting to initiate any sort of conversation in that context is going out of your way in my book.", "That woman not only cheated with his dad, but she encouraged his dad - who is obviously also an asshole - to financially abandon his kids.  \n\n\nShe was asking for this.", "Go for it! Seems to be your go-to threat. You wreck a few homes or something?", "I agree that his father is at fault too, but in relevance with the scene, his father wasn't there. That's what I'm saying.", "Yea for sure. I only said light YTA cause same.", "Ok let me rephrase in hopes that I don't trigger.  \nWhy does everybody keep ***saying*** that she walked up to their table?\n\nThe hostess sat them next to her and her son. Why they didn't just ask for a different table right away is beyond me but my point is she didn't go out of her way. She likely just turned her head.", "I agree with you too. I was just adding to the discussion. Sorry if it came off in a combative way", "Well, here's to possible future jail *raises oj glass", "Than why make the statement she ruined his childhood? His father cheated on his marriage and thus ruined his childhood.  There was no need to cause a public scene. OP litteral could have just said hi back and moved on. OP could have literally said \" I don't wish to speak to you at this time, have a great day\" .  Like using polite language to avoid a public meltdown like a toddler.", "Yeah, I gotcha. I personally have absolutely no sympathy for homewreckers, and while I don't agree with OP clearly still having contact with the father that was just as much at fault, that's not what's on trial here", "Had to scroll down way too far to see the sanity in this thread.", "Easy to say if your parents are the fucking Brady bunch, but if you have a dad that cheats on your mom with a ho, who then encourages him to cut his kids off and you as a older child of the family, who then has to help support his mom and siblings, you be singing a different tune.  NTA", "Dude, they were at the same restaurant, and got seated next to each other. She was acknowledging his existence, considering they'd known each other for years. It would've been weird to NOT say hi. She was literally just being polite. Christ, school must be out in this comment section.", "If someone you hate tried to do small talk I don\u2019t see the harm in telling them to fuck off.", "Politeness is one of the more disgusting aspects of bourgeois culture. \n\nWhat you gave her was karma.", "She exploded your childhood (alongside your dad obviously).\n\nNTA", "NTA: And what? Bottle that shit up your whole life so it can eat you alive from the inside?", "Nta, you tried to ignore her, and she was to stupid to not read the room that you didn\u2019t want to address her. She went in for seconds like you owe her something.  And she got a \u201c let me tell you what I really think response\u201d.", "Your wife didn't have to deal with years of trauma and resentment so it's easy for her to say take the high road. If you had straight up went for her, you would have been an ass but she is the one who kept trying to force herself on you when clearly you weren't interested. She got what she deserved.", "There\u2019s no need to be polite to shitty people. She\u2019s a shitty person.", "You walked in and didn't engage them, that's the first sign of I'm not interested. She approached you and instead of being away from the conversation doubled down. Ya you probably could have handled it better if she wasn't pushing your buttons NTA", "Nooo. you tried to ignore her. She was too stupid to let it go and got exactly what was coming to her. Some people just shit their pants at confrontation. They are not you, they have not lived your life, and in my opinion, it could have been way worse. I\u2019m glad you were civil to your step bro, though. He deserved that.", "Nah, you\u2019re good.", "You tried ignoring.  It didn't work.  You tried non-explosive.  It didn't work.  So you went explosive. Maybe less explosive would have been better, but this woman obviously has no sense boundaries and feels like she is the center of the gorram universe, so, do you really want to risk her not taking the third hint that you want nothing to do with her?", "I personally think the homewrecker needed to hear it! NTA", "Nope, some people deserve politeness but not everybody especially the ones who are homewreckers and cheaters they deserve nothing but harsh words and if they don't understand the harsh words from you or anyone else than you we're on point exactly\n\nNTA", "She pushed you to it!  It's not like you walked up to her and screamed it in her face. I think you've held that in long enough.", "No, she fucked around and found out, got what she deserved.", "Nah, man. I mean, you didn't hit anybody, but you told them exactly what you thought about them.\n\nIdk I personally love this.\n\nIt's not like she spilled your ice cream by accident 20 years ago; she fucked your life long and hard\n\nI'm proud of you.\n\nYou made your feelings known in no uncertain terms without a hint of violence to be seen.", "I always call those reactions \u201cinsane\u201d because that\u2019s what they are.", "Dude, please read the post AGAIN and try to put yourself into OP's shoes, if you can.", "This so much! If I could, I'd give you an award! The sense of entitlement some ppl have just blows me away. Smh", "Love it!!", "Just got home from work. \n\nMy former step-brother does not like his mom. It was probably the only series of real conversations we ever had. She and my dad also ruined her marriage to step bro\u2019s dad, and my dad moved into their former house which was *so fucking uncomfortable* esp when step bro\u2019s dad would come to pick him up and my dad would like, invite him in for a glass of wine super casually haha. Mortifying. I can\u2019t imagine what actually living there full time was like for step bro.", "Its the raw materials for the more advanced cluebat and cluehammer(often seen in anime)", "She didn\u2019t physically go out of her way, sure. But  the phrase is typically used in a metaphorical sense, as in \u201cdoing something you really shouldn\u2019t have and had no good reason to in the first place.\u201d In that second sense, it\u2019s quite an apt description. \n\nAs for saying she walked up, I misread the comment. It\u2019s sort of easy to do based on how it\u2019s written to be honest, seeing how OP buried the lede. It makes essentially no difference in my opinion though. \n\nEven if circumstance brought them together, OP was fine with ignoring her. She had no good reason to engage with him after what she did\u2014especially in a way that downplayed their relationship / her negative effect on his life\u2014yet she still chose to engage."]}
