SIL was \"down and out\" two weeks ago and called us for help with groceries to feed her, her husband and her kid. No problem. We give them $500 for food. We aren't hard up so it was no issue. \n\nWell, we came to visit her today and find out that all of this was a bold face lie. Basically, she has been working 60+ hours a week and bringing in weekly paychecks of $1400+. For a bit of context, I want to lay out her expenses (I know because I'm the one who manages them): land tax- $650 a year, car insurance- $487 a month for 2 vehicles, car payment- $339 a month, electric- $228 a month, phones- $80 for two phones and all the rest is her streaming devices, which run about $40 a month. This obviously doesn't include gas money or food cost. But on one paycheck of hers alone she could cover 90% of her bills. \n\nAnyways, we get here today to visit and find out that she has a full time live in roommate now who pays $1200 a month AND she has convinced this roommate to take over her car payment and electric bill. Not only this but while I'm sitting right here, she is on the phone with the insurance company trying to get them to switch that over to her roommates name. But the thing that REALLY pissed me off? I was told that the roommate just put $800 worth of food in the house just last week. Meaning the $500 that we gave SIL for food was not needed for food. She used it to buy Pentatonix VIP tickets for her and her kid. Upon finding this out, I just looked at her in front of her roommate and said \"wow, you are such a fucking mooch\" and walk out. \n\nApparently SIL said to my husband that I was out of line and that she \"really is hard up\" and that I wouldn't be welcome back there until I apologize. Which I never will because fuck that. AITA?\n\nETA: I'm a financial advisor. She asked me 2 years ago to help her and her husband manage their bills because they are bad with money and he doesn't work anymore (hasn't for 2 years). Turns out she got a promotion and has only been putting half of her paychecks in to the account I manage for her, so when she asked me for the $500 we had no problem handing it over to her because I physically saw that she didn't have much money in that account.", "created_utc": 1688749826, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14td6gh/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_mooch/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And WTH is wrong with the roommate??? Talk about getting taken advantage of!!", "NTA not even close.

So, she has been depositing half of her paycheck in to the account I manage for her bills and essentially blindsiding me in to believing that she was still hard up.
