She's never looked bigger from behind\". I told her I wasn't doing this, I'm not having this talk. My wife tells me that our daughter is ' still getting fatter' and that I don't care. I told her I care, but I'm not going to start a conversation on the foundation of \" Her stomach is big. Her butt is big\". My wife tells me she's just explaining what she sees and that a 16 year old girl struggling into her pants is a red flag. I reiterated that I wasn't doing this talk. She said we have to.

It\u2019s your job as a parent to instill health mindfulness in her now. \n\nBut if she\u2019s simply gaining weight then your wife is being completely unreasonable.", "If your daughter is overweight then I don\u2019t think your wife is an AH to get concerned.

Your wife doesn't need to make disparaging comments about your daughter's appearance to have a serious discussion with you about her health.

But if you can take your dad glasses off for a minute and think about whether she looks like she is unhealthily overweight, then decude what you think should happen.\n\nBecause if she is actually overweight and likely not changing then you need to have that convo and look into any active hobbies you can get into as a family or anything she would like to get into herself.\n\nTheres so many out there.

She's never looked bigger from behind\". I told her I wasn't doing this, I'm not having this talk. My wife tells me that our daughter is ' still getting fatter' and that I don't care. I told her I care, but I'm not going to start a conversation on the foundation of \" Her stomach is big. Her butt is big\". My wife tells me she's just explaining what she sees and that a 16 year old girl struggling into her pants is a red flag. I reiterated that I wasn't doing this talk. She said we have to. I told her I was not going to discuss this again and that I don't want her bringing it up & left the room.

It is their full time job to keep their body fat low and most people can't devote that kind of time to it.\n\nBottom line, if she's already overweight, she's probably always going to be overweight.

Also please take her to a doctor this weight issue could be caused from some medical issue as well and they could probably talk to her about it, which I think might be less hurtful coming from a medical perspective. I do think you are a good dad for acknowledging what damage it can do to your daughter if said the wrong way. But it does sound like your wife is genuinely concerned, and she kinda has a point.

How about binge drink?
