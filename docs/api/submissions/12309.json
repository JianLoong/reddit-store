You're no saint in this.", "YTA.  the kid didn't make the mistake.

NAH, cause I think it's okay to ask, but you're within your rights to say no. You don't need to live with anyone you don't want to, but you and your husband do need to go back to counseling, as I would expect some fallout from this. (Also, not to borrow trouble from tomorrow, but does that mean you would be expected to put up his affair partner when she wants to visit her son? Cause eff that.)", "It's a child left over from an affair. I don't know of anyone who thinks they'll feel completely at ease around it every day.", "I mean to her and logically, the kid is an affair child , she didn\u2019t consent to her husband having another kid with another woman while sleeping with her , she\u2019s not punishing him , she\u2019s uncomfortable with him there , though it\u2019s not the kids fault, he\u2019s still a reminder of her husbands infidelity which is bound to make her uncomfortable to have him living in her home", "My thoughts exactly.  \u201cMy husband,\u201d and \u201cwe worked it out,\u201d but \u201can unforeseen consequence,\u201d \u201cthat boy,\u201d \u201cthat kid\u201d.

I\u2019m sure she knows the kid is innocent. But it\u2019s not that easy to deal with the reminder of the worst time in your life living in your home. \n\nI think it\u2019s good that she\u2019s not putting the child or herself in a position to be further harmed by the selfish decisions of others.", "But that\u2019s not the case. OP has accepted the child, she just doesn\u2019t want to bring him into her household as an adult, or soon to be, and assume financial responsibility for him.", "Lols. Yup", "And it's very common, they blame EVERYBODY but their cheating partner. They are willing to critize whoever their bf mess with but don't hold accountable their ex for cheating on them", "This is a really good point. I also noticed \u201caffair partner\u201d instead of \u201cthe child\u2019s mother.\u201d Since the \u201caffair partner\u201d is half her husband\u2019s age, I\u2019d hope OP after all this time could have a little grace for her (since she gave that grace to her husband, and he\u2019s the one who actually broke his vows).", "This. 100% this.", "Yes louder for the people in the back!!!", "Right it\u2019s not the kids fault that sex is more important than commitment to their biological parents", "I was about to ask the same thing, I doubt this kid really wants to stay there. He probably would much rather go, live in a dorm in college, and get the full experience, rather than live with a stepparent who resents him.", "And for that kid! So unfair to ask this of either of them.", "That\u2019s been my going theory for a while, honestly. Just a robot in a lab tasked with parsing everyday morality, interspersed with karma farmers. And a whole bunch of people who like our drama in bite-sized text instead of, say, reality TV.", "The husband can be responsible for this kid somewhere else. I think it's perfectly acceptable that OP was \"fine\" when this kid wasn't going to be in her face everyday. She's not the asshole. At all.", "More bluntly, your husband betrayed you - the kids did not.\n\nJust as much as marrying a person with (minor) children means you have a responsibility to those children, staying with a person who has children outside of your marriage leaves you with a responsibility to those children.\n\nIt is reasonable to provide economically for your husbands son because dorm living seems like a great option for him - just not so much economically for husband and AP. So are you an AH for not wanting him in your home at this point in time - no.\n\nBut I\u2019m caught wondering about the life this poor kid has had if there is such vitriol for him in your short post. And clearly the kid has never gotten to spend any significant time with his dad - his dad put you over his child and didn\u2019t ask for any custody. My heart bleeds for this child you call \u201cthat kid.\u201d Being around you is probably worse for the child than having him around is for you - because at one point he was just a little boy and had no idea why neither his dad nor you seem to love him.", "I hope OP reads this, probably the best place for her to get the support and POV she needs.", "The kid does not want to stay with his dad, the das wants to save money.", "This is what I see way too often. Yes, you're pissed about the situation and you have a right to be. But the kid did nothing wrong. He's just a young kid trying to start his adult life. Don't make him suffer for his father's mistakes.", "She\u2019s not denying him a path , his parents want to save their $$$ that\u2019s them denying him a path by being cheapskates with their kids education", "I'm sure if his mother can sleep with a married man she can also afford his everything. \n\nOp's husband cheated on her and had him?? If he moves in the truma during the affair is gonna come back in. But again how can men understand that.", "\u201cYou pushed you husband away which led to his infidelity \u201c nah ah , y\u2019all can\u2019t blame her for a man not keeping his wick in his pants , it\u2019s not her fault he cheated, that\u2019s on him , a grown man is responsible for his own infidelities and choices, full stop pick me girl , that was such a wack statement wtf", "Harder to live in denial when you see the child every day maybe. Idk", "What the heck? Why are you coming out of left field with so much animosity?", "Who let the affair partner on Reddit?", "Bruh, I can faintly see where you want to go with the \"it's OP fault\", but this statement needs a LOT of refinement, it's not that much of a clean cut there. Plus it's not truly the question here.\n\nThe second sentence however makes you purely and simply a true AH.\n\nEdit : Nvm, troll account.", ">>it\u2019s your fault he cheated\n\nThere\u2019s some words I would say to you, but they would get me banned from this sub. You should delete your obviously jaded comment.", "What a horrible thing to say. It is never the fault of the person cheated on that the partner decided to cheat rather than resolve issues in the relationship or just break up.\n\nAnd why on earth would SHE be responsible for HIS child with another woman? \n\nOP, ignore this misogynistic take.", "NTA.\n\nCheating is cheating. Hubs had a choice to stand by his partner or leave. He tried to have it both ways. CLEARLY OP was not ok when the cheating.\n\nTo blame OP for her husband's infidelity is victim blaming. He could have spanked it for 3 years. Sex is not a marital right. OP has 100% bodily autonomy. If Hubs has an issue with that, he could have abandoned his wife and kids, and exit the marriage for one or more of his mistresses.", "Why would I take in his affair child?", "NTA. Your emotions are legitimate op.Your significant other ought to be mindful with him elsewhere.", "Yeah, NAH makes sense to me. Your husband made a mistake all those years ago, and maybe you still need to work on this situation because you're still quite stressed about it, but your husband is allowed to ask this because it's his house too, but you're allowed to say you can't share a house with your husband's affair child. Sharing a house with a teenager you feel like this towards would be a really bad plan, because that's your safe space, and it will come out in how you interact with him. Of all the not AHs here, the teenager is the least AH of them all.", "Yes! And when you ask why, the answer is always \"well, the child's a reminder of my husband's infidelity.\" Like, um, is your husband's penis not a more triggering reminder of infidelity? He certainly used that to create the child you hate!", "And I clearly stated in my opening sentence that she is not an AH. However, I did feel after reading her statement that the child, the person who bears 0% of the blame for the circumstances regarding their birth, should not be the target of her anger. Be mad at the husband, blame the husband, divorce the husband, all of these are perfectly reasonable. But regardless of if the child lives with them or not, they are going to be a part of the husband's life, and they did nothing to deserve being the focus of anger over this.", "To be fair that\u2019s not mentioned, but if he wants to stay with his dad he should be able to. He shouldn\u2019t be banned from his own fathers house for something he had no control over", "That's what therapy is for. But her obvious disdain AT the child for the actions of *her husband* shows whatever therapy she has done hasn't worked and all shes actually accomplished is moving the unresolved feelings into an innocent kid who had no say in the matter anyways. \n\nAnd I'm a woman.

You very clearly still have a lot of (understandable) anger towards him and the situation.\n\nHowever, I find your attitude towards his son to be appalling. Your home is your husband\u2019s home too. This young man is your husband\u2019s son. It shouldn\u2019t matter how he came to be because **he didn\u2019t ask to be born.** He should be able to exist in his father\u2019s home without being treated like sh!t for something that is in no way his fault.\n\nIf you can\u2019t accept that then you should have cut ties years ago.", "because you took in your husband?
