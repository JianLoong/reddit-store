They are perfectly aware that some of their priests have drinking problems. There is a lot of stress in the job.  My late great-uncle filled in for a fellow priest who had to go through rehab to recover. Your mother is in denial. Given how often priests must drive, he has a very real chance of causing harm.

To admit you were right means admitting the man of God she looked up to and defended is a drunk. Who doesn't respect her God or her husband the way she expected and the beliefs they had together for many years.\n\nAnd maybe if she had her husband to be shocked and appalled with about how they were both taken in and what a sad state of affairs it is and all, she might look at it differently. \n\nBut she's facing a horrible new reality and then gets an extra (unintended) slap from the man who's meant to be her pillar of religious support at this time...it's another loss and that's just too much.

She hasn't dealt with the pain of losing her husband and probably just wanted to be respectful at his last rights. A funeral is not a time to joke or giggle so there is merit in what she's saying.\n\nThat being said; I'm here bursting into laughter just reading your story. I can't imagine how hard it would have been for you to contain your laughter at Fr. Tumbly Mumbly over there. Assuming if none of his shenanigans occurred in the first place, I'm sure you and your siblings would have been quiet during the service and not giggling. You laughing at a funny situation does not equate to you disrespecting your dad. However I can understand it doesn't look good from a third person POV, a child laughing at their parents funeral. Normally even I would find that weird. But this is funny AF. Don't read too much into your mum's words.\n\nOn a more serious note - as a Christian myself, priests absolutely CANNOT be coming stoned to the altar to say a mass. That is extremely disrespectful, what's more; it was a funeral mass. It defeats the point of their job and goes against what they are told to do. I would not want to attend a church where a man who is supposed to be preaching self control, can't follow it himself. I sometimes wonder why people hate Christians and then you have these absolute buttheads who make me go, \"oh; that's why.\"", "NTA. Your mother's anger is misdirected .

Your parents took you to a church with a drunk pastor for years.

He and he alone made a mockery.of the funeral. Your mother is blaming you, because all the men have some sort of excuse. You did nothing at all wrong.", "NTA, sorry for your loss, but this post had me laughing. And honestly, I get it, I'd be shaking with held in laughter, and then crack and shatter when the priest tripped. So I'd like to share this story about my (maternal) grandpa's funeral.\n\nThere is a feeling I remember, from my grandpa's funeral when I was 12. I kind of stuck with my sister and niece, both 13 at the time. We cried a lot, and we missed grandpa dearly. At one point, one of us wanted to get some fresh air. It was hard watching grandma grieve while my heartbroken aunt and mom tried to console her. The vibe was so heavy and full of sorrow that it stayed with me a long time. Like my chest was being compressed and my insides died. It was a beautiful, warm spring day then, and each one after it  had me remembering that vibe for years. Anyway, we needed a small break, so we went outside to the parking lot, quietly weeping and sniveling. Wiping at our noses.\n\nAnd then, my niece ripped the loudest, longest, wettest fart I had ever heard by that point in life. The sound, the vibration, the shift in the notes. It was glorious. I have never laughed so hard, and that tight oppressing feeling snapped. It may sound strange to some, but bursting out laughing felt like relief. Like a deep breath when you wake up from a dream where you were drowning and actually started holding your breath while you slept. It felt wonderful, all three of us were unable to stop laughing until it hurt, until we were out of breath and exhausted. \n\nEventually we went back inside, and as far as I can recall we kept our faces straight and didn't bother anyone, but this was nearly twenty years ago. I don't really remember the people around us or whether they were aware of our bout of hysterical laughter in the parking lot. But I remember that feeling of relief after the suffocating sadness of saying goodbye to grandpa for the last time. \n\nIn the end, we all respond differently to the loss of a loved one. Your mother may not understand your response because hers is simply different. I like to think grandpa would have been relieved too to see his granddaughters laughing. He was a bit of a scamp, almost cheeky, with a tendency to go against the grain. The kind that pretended to eat grass, saying it was good for the stomach, and laugh his ass off when we fell for it and actually took a mouthful of grass. He'd have laughed at that fart too.", "Not the a hole.

I'd have lost it if I were there. \nNTA", "My grandmother's funeral ceremony was held by a drunken priest. She wasn't even Christian, but her sister somehow took the reins on the funeral and convinced her priest to participate. I'm sure she regretted it. The priest kept calling my grandmother by the living sister's name, expressed shock over her being cremated, tried to stir up drama about grandmother's husband sitting in his truck in the parking lot and refusing to attend, was scandalized by the husband not being the father of her children (she'd been divorced from their father for decades), flipped throught the Bible and read off random irrelevant passages, gave a whimsical lesson on sexual reproduction, and ending by slamming the Bible shut mid-passage and staggering off. I will never forget it.

Sometimes shit happens at funerals and the high emotions come out as hysterical giggles instead.\n\nWhen my uncle passed a year and half ago from cancer, we had such a moment.  \n\nSmall backstory for context:  anytime somebody would audibly fart in my uncles' proximity, he'd always say \"That guy's butt just said Pbbbbt!\" and he'd blow a raspberry.  Always.  Without fail.\n\nSO, myself, my husband, and our children are sitting at his funeral.  We're crying and emotional, as one do at a funeral.  They're starting to have people go up row by row after the service to walk past the casket and say the final goodbyes, console my aunt and his children, etc.  My other uncle stands up in the row in front of us and as he does, he lets out an audible fart, turns red as a tomato, and immediately books it to the bathrooms instead of walking past.  This all happens pretty quick, but I heard my deceased uncle's voice in my head clear as a bell saying, \"That guy's butt just said Pbbt!\"  Almost in the same instant, I hear my then 15-year-old daughter whisper it just loudly enough for the 4 of us to hear and suddenly all four of us are fighting back silent hysterics.\n\nFortunately, we were able to escape because everybody thought my daughter was just absolutely distraught and we weren't going to make her go past the casket.  It wasn't until several months after his death that I felt comfortable telling my aunt the story and she said she that was absolutely the most HIM things that ever could have happened at his funeral and he was probably laughing his ass off in Heaven watching it go down.", "\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "Also, I\u2019m pretty impressed that he was successful in masking the laughing as crying for the whole funeral.", "Imagine Sister Michael drunk at a funeral!", "The same thing happened to me at my grandfather's funeral.", "YES!!!"]}
