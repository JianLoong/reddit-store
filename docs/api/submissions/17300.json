To admit you were right means admitting the man of God she looked up to and defended is a drunk. Who doesn't respect her God or her husband the way she expected and the beliefs they had together for many years.\n\nAnd maybe if she had her husband to be shocked and appalled with about how they were both taken in and what a sad state of affairs it is and all, she might look at it differently. \n\nBut she's facing a horrible new reality and then gets an extra (unintended) slap from the man who's meant to be her pillar of religious support at this time...it's another loss and that's just too much.

She hasn't dealt with the pain of losing her husband and probably just wanted to be respectful at his last rights. A funeral is not a time to joke or giggle so there is merit in what she's saying.\n\nThat being said; I'm here bursting into laughter just reading your story. I can't imagine how hard it would have been for you to contain your laughter at Fr. Tumbly Mumbly over there. Assuming if none of his shenanigans occurred in the first place, I'm sure you and your siblings would have been quiet during the service and not giggling. You laughing at a funny situation does not equate to you disrespecting your dad. However I can understand it doesn't look good from a third person POV, a child laughing at their parents funeral. Normally even I would find that weird. But this is funny AF. Don't read too much into your mum's words.\n\nOn a more serious note - as a Christian myself, priests absolutely CANNOT be coming stoned to the altar to say a mass. That is extremely disrespectful, what's more; it was a funeral mass. It defeats the point of their job and goes against what they are told to do. I would not want to attend a church where a man who is supposed to be preaching self control, can't follow it himself.

You did nothing at all wrong.", "NTA, sorry for your loss, but this post had me laughing. And honestly, I get it, I'd be shaking with held in laughter, and then crack and shatter when the priest tripped. So I'd like to share this story about my (maternal) grandpa's funeral.\n\nThere is a feeling I remember, from my grandpa's funeral when I was 12. I kind of stuck with my sister and niece, both 13 at the time. We cried a lot, and we missed grandpa dearly. At one point, one of us wanted to get some fresh air. It was hard watching grandma grieve while my heartbroken aunt and mom tried to console her. The vibe was so heavy and full of sorrow that it stayed with me a long time. Like my chest was being compressed and my insides died. It was a beautiful, warm spring day then, and each one after it  had me remembering that vibe for years. Anyway, we needed a small break, so we went outside to the parking lot, quietly weeping and sniveling. Wiping at our noses.\n\nAnd then, my niece ripped the loudest, longest, wettest fart I had ever heard by that point in life. The sound, the vibration, the shift in the notes. It was glorious. I have never laughed so hard, and that tight oppressing feeling snapped. It may sound strange to some, but bursting out laughing felt like relief. Like a deep breath when you wake up from a dream where you were drowning and actually started holding your breath while you slept. It felt wonderful, all three of us were unable to stop laughing until it hurt, until we were out of breath and exhausted. \n\nEventually we went back inside, and as far as I can recall we kept our faces straight and didn't bother anyone, but this was nearly twenty years ago. I don't really remember the people around us or whether they were aware of our bout of hysterical laughter in the parking lot. But I remember that feeling of relief after the suffocating sadness of saying goodbye to grandpa for the last time. \n\nIn the end, we all respond differently to the loss of a loved one. Your mother may not understand your response because hers is simply different. I like to think grandpa would have been relieved too to see his granddaughters laughing. He was a bit of a scamp, almost cheeky, with a tendency to go against the grain. The kind that pretended to eat grass, saying it was good for the stomach, and laugh his ass off when we fell for it and actually took a mouthful of grass. He'd have laughed at that fart too.", "Not the a hole.

She wasn't even Christian, but her sister somehow took the reins on the funeral and convinced her priest to participate. I'm sure she regretted it. The priest kept calling my grandmother by the living sister's name, expressed shock over her being cremated, tried to stir up drama about grandmother's husband sitting in his truck in the parking lot and refusing to attend, was scandalized by the husband not being the father of her children (she'd been divorced from their father for decades), flipped throught the Bible and read off random irrelevant passages, gave a whimsical lesson on sexual reproduction, and ending by slamming the Bible shut mid-passage and staggering off. I will never forget it.

Sometimes shit happens at funerals and the high emotions come out as hysterical giggles instead.\n\nWhen my uncle passed a year and half ago from cancer, we had such a moment.  \n\nSmall backstory for context:  anytime somebody would audibly fart in my uncles' proximity, he'd always say \"That guy's butt just said Pbbbbt!\" and he'd blow a raspberry.  Always.  Without fail.\n\nSO, myself, my husband, and our children are sitting at his funeral.  We're crying and emotional, as one do at a funeral.  They're starting to have people go up row by row after the service to walk past the casket and say the final goodbyes, console my aunt and his children, etc.  My other uncle stands up in the row in front of us and as he does, he lets out an audible fart, turns red as a tomato, and immediately books it to the bathrooms instead of walking past.  This all happens pretty quick, but I heard my deceased uncle's voice in my head clear as a bell saying, \"That guy's butt just said Pbbt!\"  Almost in the same instant, I hear my then 15-year-old daughter whisper it just loudly enough for the 4 of us to hear and suddenly all four of us are fighting back silent hysterics.\n\nFortunately, we were able to escape because everybody thought my daughter was just absolutely distraught and we weren't going to make her go past the casket.

My Dad just passed too and I was laughing at how absurd our pastor was.  Sometimes you gotta laugh Dad would have.", "NAH - I can see why your mother is upset and I can see why you laughed. I was actually at a somewhat similar funeral. The widow wanted it at the local parish. However, they hadn\u2019t actually attended at in in 20 years (very elderly housebound couple) the community had changed and there wasn\u2019t a priest who spoke good English available for whatever reason. We couldn\u2019t really tell if it was all an English barrier issue or drunk. The whole thing was very awkward and at the end when someone said it would have been nice if he had gotten the name right at least and lots of people started laughing which made it much more awkward.", "NTA. i've been to a lot of funerals in my 22 years of life. i remember being in church at like 16 yrs old for easter with my twin, my aunt, and my 5 cousins all there. the youngest male cousin (less than a year younger than me) fell asleep and one of his siblings jolted him awake suddenly. do you know how hard it is to pretend a group of 8 people aren't laughing in a silent ass church? it's even harder when one of them just let out a high pitched scream bc he was sleeping when he didn't have been. i've also sat by several family members at funerals who should honestly never be allowed near funerals. i had one uncle jokingly talk shit about damn near everyone who came to the funeral...during the funeral. and as a kid, i'd sometimes let out a giggle bc some people were just extremely dramatic and the way they cry-screamed was hilarious to little, unempathetic me. yes, funerals can be sad and you probably shouldn't laugh during them, but they can also be hilarious and i highly doubt your dad would've felt disrespected considering what happened", "NTA at all! I\u2019m very sorry for your loss but hopefully this made the day easier for you. \n\nAt my grandad\u2019s funeral (Irish Catholic), his priest kept drinking the wine and he was getting tipsy. It was so funny and we still talk about it 3 years later! The best part was it was during lockdown so it was streamed for family and friends to see and someone saved a video. \n\nDon\u2019t take what your mum said personally, she sounds very traditional and no doubt that was a hard day for her", "NTA.  People say and do very weird things at funerals.  Grief sometimes takes a dark humorous turn.", "Wow. Just wow. NTA. This must\u2019ve been amazing because I laughed just reading it", "NAH\n\nShe's grieving and very sensitive on the subject.  You're also grieving, and it was funny.", "This is in Ireland, isn't it. It's the way you tell the story, as well as the characters.", "NTA. If your father was a man of humor and also believed in the rumors about PP he would 100% approve and laugh right alongside you!\n\nIf he was more stoic, then this definitely helped you get through the day.", "NTA - I'm sorry for your loss. I just lost my mom, and had to laugh at the little things to make it through the service. My mom would have laughed too. People grieve differently, you can't help the situation.", "NTA. Lol\u2026. Religion is whacked.", "I mean, I guess NTA for laughing at the priest, but idk how you can laugh. I'd be absolutely livid that this guy is fucking up my dad's funeral. Like I'm trying to mourn and have closure, and this guy is on holiday.\n\nI suppose if it happened to someone else it might be kinda cringe-funny", "OP, i do think you need to apologize to your mom. She wanted a Mass with solemnity and dignity to say farewell to your father.  It seems like she\u2019s used to tuning out Father\u2019s drinking and could pretend there was stll some dignity, but the giggling shattered all that. It would have been better to step out to compose yourself", "I think Jesus would have laughed too - with your dad by his side. NTA\n\nI am sorry for your loss.", "This has to be the most Irish post I have ever read.", "I feel sorry for your dad, this reads like something you'd want to see in a movie.", "Sorry for your loss. Sounds like he was a gas.", "The drunk priest or the case of the giggles?\n\nCause my grandad's wake gave us all a case of the giggles \nHe didn't want one, Nan did. So she arranged one. \nWe had a higgledy piggedly arrangement of a big ass family in their tiny irish house with tiny irish rooms. So they set up a mic n sound system\n\nSomehow~~ *insert eerie ghost noises* the prayers came over the sound system all messed up and usually sounding more like curses n insults.\nWe eyed each other all across the rooms n snorted n but lips to avoid our Nans evil eye \n\nBest wake ever", "A dear family friend's mother passed when I was a kid. They were Episcopalians, and that religion doesn't throw out any sacrament wine once it's been blessed.  The priest overestimated how many people would be at the funeral and had to finish the blessed wine on his own.  After that he had to call someone to help him finish the ceremony.  I just remember he was trying to shake hands and offer words of comfort as two of his priest friends were holding him up, one on each side.\n\nI was terrified I was going to laugh, and my mother would kill me.  She was glaring at me so hard the elderly people in the same pew started stifling laughter.", "If I died I\u2019d be happy that you could laugh during my funeral. Tbh I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep a straight face either.", "I hope my own funeral is at least half as funny. Truly your dad was blessed.", "OMG, this sounds like an SNL skit. If anyone disrespected this man of God, as your mother says, it's the priest himself. I just wonder what your dad would have said. (My condolences.) NTA.", "holy wow..I'm sorry, no disrespect to your ma...but I'd have died laughing under the circumstances too. NTA.", "YTA. But I would have laughed too so I'm an AH too \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. honestly, I'd be laughing my arse off too", "NAH\n\nIf she didn't want you to laugh, she shouldn't have hired a clown.", "We had something similar with my Mom. It took a few comments, but everyone thinks it's funny now. Your mother may even find the humor, after her horror at the funeral passes. Maybe.\n\nIt's all in how you view things.\n\nNTA", "I sometimes laugh at funerals because it's a reaction to emotions I can't control just like crying.", "\n>she said it was horrific to laugh during the funeral and that I was disrespectful to a man of God, the church and to her and dad\n\nMost funerals I've been to in Ireland have a mix of jokes in the speaks.", "When God gifts you an impromptu Benny Hill sketch in your time of need, you better laugh.", "You let Dougal do a funeral!", "Or Chuckles the Clown's funeral on the Mary Tyler Moore Show.", "If only I could give you more up votes!", "My Aunt had some amazing stories about the Drunken Priest of St Mary's, AK.  Seems they sent priests, such as yours, to remote places.  Hers was famous for taking off people's porches with the snow plow.", "Can\u2019t get priests, that\u2019s probably the reason.", "Can you just try to be a little respectful to your mother during this time? Is that too much to ask? If so, the second best thing to do would be to leave her alone.", "Oh Lord, a punny guy.  He would have liked you.", "I was going to suggest the same thing. Drinking on the job isn't a good look for a priest", "As a German person... how could you have missed that?", "Somebody rolled up with a dead bear they'd shot at my grandma's visitation, which was at a funeral home mind you. Absolutely no idea why. A bunch of is went out to take a look though. Three guess which part of the US i live in. Lol", "YTA and  I gotta call BS on the whole story. My money says, didn\u2019t happen. Oh, you may have laughed through your fathers funeral, but the rest, nope, didn\u2019t happen. In this day and age if the priest farts on the altar ( which by the way is the spelling you were looking for) someone calls the Bishop or diocese.", "NTA. \n\nI am getting Father Ted vibes here.", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. The only disrespectful one there was the priest.", "You are NTA. \n\nThe priest is very much TA for getting drunk before a funeral.\n\nThe priest\u2019s superiors are most certainly TA for not recognizing that he has a severe drinking problem that interfere with the pastoring of his congregation.", "NTA - it is a generational thing. I would laugh too but be astounded by how disrespectful the priest was, awful behavior. Your Mom is old school who respect their elders, professionals and clergy without fail. That is how this guy has gotten away with it\nfor so long. Kids would post a drunken mass to TikTok, it would go viral and the priest would be gone.", " Nta\nYour mom should be mad at the priest for getting shit faced not you", "Jaysus, if you can't laugh at a funeral...", "NTA. If anyone was disrespectful, it was the priest who got hammered before a funeral.", "Oh no. Report the priest to his diocese. That's unacceptable. \n\nYou're NTA for laughing, though!", "NTA it was hilarious to you but awful of the priest to put your family through more than you\u2019re already going through. It\u2019s okay to laugh even though someone you love is dead. Humor can help some through grief. You\u2019re grieving too and it\u2019s not up to mom to decide how you do it. Laughter can\u2019t be held in any easier than tears. She should be furious with the drunk priest.", "I\u2019m picturing the headline starting with \u201cFlorida Man\u2026\u201d\n\nNo stones being thrown here, I\u2019m in Texas and I would be shocked if that didn\u2019t happen here", "North Carokina but you did get the south right lol \n\nYeah i could see that happening in texas too lol", "See, I would not have guessed NC if you\u2019d given me 5 chances!

If anyone can laugh at an inappropriate moment, it's me. So unfortunately, if I were at a funeral being conducted by a drunk off his ass priest,  I would be rolling in the aisle-and I'm a practicing Catholic.", "NTA, and I'm sorry for your loss. And from your description of the PP's behaviour it appears that he disrespected your late father and his grieving family. Your laughter was probably just a way to cope with a horrible situation. For the sake of the PP and everyone else in the parish I sincerely hope he gets help for the alcoholism", "Grief is weird and there are more unconventional methods than laughing at a drunk person. \n\nMy (ex) husband and I created \u201cfantasy funeral\u201d when my dad died.

My brother and I are notorious for getting the giggles, the kind where you finally stop laughing and then you make eye contact and start all over again. We got the giggles during my uncles funeral a while back, timed perfectly for a looong prayer to be recited to an otherwise dead silent room.", "NTA. I find this to be accurate, hilarious, a former Catholic and true. My uncle showed up to his deceased wife's wake 3 sheets to the wind and tried to drag his wife out of the casket for one last dance.\n\nIt's not a priest story but a Catholic funeral story. They can get wild along with weddings.", "NTA\n\nGod has a sense of humor.\n\nLook at duck-billed platypuses those things are fuggin redonkulous.\n\nI bet your dad was roaring with laughter too.", "I don't know about you, but I laugh when I am nervous.
