{"id": 9959, "submission_id": "112cy1r", "title": "AITA for banning my wife and BIL from a property I own?", "selftext": "Feels like I'm smelling burnt toast with everything that's currently going on. I own a small piece of land with my cousin about an 1hr away from where we live. We're 3 months apart in age and have a ton of common interests. About 7 years ago we decided to go 50/50 on a piece of land so we could fish and shoot on. We built two tiny homes on the property and sort of a doggie \"house/hotel\"(important in a sec). We do a guys night with our friends twice a year, but visit the property once to twice a week on rotation to do chores. Mowing the lawn, etc. \n\n\nI took my BIL fishing in August of last year and he had been pestering me to allow him access to the property to fish on occasion. After a quick discussion with my cousin, we decided not to. We don't like the idea of people being there without our supervision. He threw a fit at first, but I thought he got over it.... until last week. \n\n\nLike I mentioned, we built a pretty sweet set up for our dogs. We rotate them out to bring them home, but for the most part they live on the property permanently. They have free reign of the property ***unless we have company over***. We pay our neighbor to refill and check on the auto feeders/water 3 times a week and we have cameras in that area. There are a minimum of 5 dogs present at all times, buy this time there was 9. We allow certain family members to drop their puppers off for a weekend if they want a break and we let our guy know to feed them individually since they aren't trained for our specific feeding setup. So we had my cousin's 2 Rotts mixes(they're not purebred but you can clearly tell they have mostly rott), his rott/mastiff mix, his golden retriever mix, my brother's BMD mix, my aunt's lab/aussie mix, my cattle dog mix, and my two mutts. They're basically the security of the property. \n\n\nHere's where the issue is. My stupid BIL decided to sneak into the property to do some fishing, and well, assumed the dogs remained in their fenced off area the whole time. They ran his ass up a tree. He called me at 6 am in tears asking to come help him. I said sure and took my sweet ass time driving there, got breakfast and everything. When we got back I pulled up the camera recording on my phone and kept making jokes at his expense, ex \"damn man, never seen you move that fast\". Wife was absolutely livid and wants me to remove the dogs from the property and apologize to her brother. I laughed at her. She hasn't brought it up again but her BIL said he's never speaking to me again. I said  I think he's lucky I talked my cousin out of trying to get trespassing charges on him and that neither are allowed there if they want to act that way. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1676400625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112cy1r/aita_for_banning_my_wife_and_bil_from_a_property/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You let other people introduce new dogs to the pack of unsupervised loose dogs occasionally and don't even see them daily? This is going to go wrong and some person or dog is going to be hurt. You do not know how a pack can react and have no control over them. How bad would it have been if this was a stranger who they chased up a tree?

That's not how you treat people.\n\nYes, she's running on emotions, and instead of being cruel you get a lot further by calmly discussing it.

We can agree to disagree at this point and honestly I have better things to do than bickering over something so stupid.

We only allowed the dogs to stay there full time after turning three. We also bring 1-2 home on weekly rotation. Those dogs are pretty active breeds that weren't properly being taken care of by their original owners so we ended up just taking them in. And believe me, while they do love us as owners, they love everyday essentially being a dog park visit even more. They start whining after about a week of being home.", "What? I take them home all the time. The dogs were not being given the proper exercise where they were before. They now get their own personal dog park and house with central heating in air. They're spoiled as fuck. Not all dogs are super attached to humas as well. You know that right? Have you ever met a chow chow?", "Is that what you are referring to? My dude, when people make ridiculous demands it is kind of hard not to laugh. And she did not only hear part of the story.
