{"id": 9959, "submission_id": "112cy1r", "title": "AITA for banning my wife and BIL from a property I own?", "selftext": "Feels like I'm smelling burnt toast with everything that's currently going on. I own a small piece of land with my cousin about an 1hr away from where we live. We're 3 months apart in age and have a ton of common interests. About 7 years ago we decided to go 50/50 on a piece of land so we could fish and shoot on. We built two tiny homes on the property and sort of a doggie \"house/hotel\"(important in a sec). We do a guys night with our friends twice a year, but visit the property once to twice a week on rotation to do chores. Mowing the lawn, etc. \n\n\nI took my BIL fishing in August of last year and he had been pestering me to allow him access to the property to fish on occasion. After a quick discussion with my cousin, we decided not to. We don't like the idea of people being there without our supervision. He threw a fit at first, but I thought he got over it.... until last week. \n\n\nLike I mentioned, we built a pretty sweet set up for our dogs. We rotate them out to bring them home, but for the most part they live on the property permanently. They have free reign of the property ***unless we have company over***. We pay our neighbor to refill and check on the auto feeders/water 3 times a week and we have cameras in that area. There are a minimum of 5 dogs present at all times, buy this time there was 9. We allow certain family members to drop their puppers off for a weekend if they want a break and we let our guy know to feed them individually since they aren't trained for our specific feeding setup. So we had my cousin's 2 Rotts mixes(they're not purebred but you can clearly tell they have mostly rott), his rott/mastiff mix, his golden retriever mix, my brother's BMD mix, my aunt's lab/aussie mix, my cattle dog mix, and my two mutts. They're basically the security of the property. \n\n\nHere's where the issue is. My stupid BIL decided to sneak into the property to do some fishing, and well, assumed the dogs remained in their fenced off area the whole time. They ran his ass up a tree. He called me at 6 am in tears asking to come help him. I said sure and took my sweet ass time driving there, got breakfast and everything. When we got back I pulled up the camera recording on my phone and kept making jokes at his expense, ex \"damn man, never seen you move that fast\". Wife was absolutely livid and wants me to remove the dogs from the property and apologize to her brother. I laughed at her. She hasn't brought it up again but her BIL said he's never speaking to me again. I said  I think he's lucky I talked my cousin out of trying to get trespassing charges on him and that neither are allowed there if they want to act that way. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1676400625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112cy1r/aita_for_banning_my_wife_and_bil_from_a_property/", "score": 996, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also have cameras which means if a code I wasn\u2019t expecting gets entered I have the ability to quickly check who is on camera and determine the level of response required (the difference between calling your wife and asking her what she\u2019s doing versus calling law enforcement on a complete stranger) and I can talk to people through that camera if needed. It sounds fancy, but it\u2019s really was a relatively low cost system. I did not add motion detectors precisely because I do have 95lb shepherds that would trigger them. However, the cameras are also nice for calling or locating the dogs on my property too.\n\nSomething like this would allow you and your cousin to know precisely who is giving out the code if there is an incident in the future (so if your wife\u2019s code is regularly used you can surmise what is happening fairly quickly). It also protects you from getting something blamed on you or your brother in law in the future that isn\u2019t your fault (example: if someone with your cousin\u2019s code enters when they aren\u2019t supposed to).", "Can we have dog pics please? There is a dog tax here\u2026 also NTA make sure only you and your cousin have a key.", "I do not want to paint the devil here, but maybe have a closer eye out for the dogs... I shure hope he is not the kind of guy to try to hurt them, but better save than sorry... Good luck to you", "Based on that I think you need to question a little more. Also NTA obviously.", "Change the locks. ASAP.", "It's starting to sink in thay she's probably just embarrassed about her dumbass brother. He's the little brother and we've been married 15 years. I was giving her space but I probably should have caught on quicker.", "Dogs USUALLY don\u2019t know to protect unless you teach them so that\u2019s pretty understandable. I had to teach my 90lb American Bully to be a guard dog and be very alert or even bite at any violence.", "I'm in a fortunate situation because this a small town they would likely call me ahead of time. I recognize this is a privilege and not the norm. Believe me, I've read the DOJ reports of how often pets are shot. I'm lucky to have the situation I am in with the property thanks to my neighbors", "Now would be a good time to ask your cousin's lawyer about spousal rights. It varies by state. I also echo a trust or LLC. It's an expense but it ensures the property stays with you and your cousin and can offer other layers of protection.", "I did see that after I commented, sorry, it was just something that hit me weird", "Damn you missed out!", "Wife doesn't seem to understand that her husband co-owns the property and can't make his cousin accept people on the property or remove the cousin's property without consent so probably all of eternity.", "Where I am in Canada and 99 percent sure the US any property bought after marriage is owned by both. He admitted it another reply it was bought after they married. He also admitted she likely does also own it in another reply.", "The He Needed Killin' defense", ">if someone did that here, they'd likely wind up shot.\n\nBy the...dogs?", "Are dogs allowed to carry firearms in Texas??", "She has not, she has been kind of quiet. If I had to guess, she's less pro-trespass, and more pro-brother. It's her youngest brother and I think she's just embarrassed about the whole thing. After reading a few of the comments here I realized that. I initially was just giving her space which is why I didn't ask. This is still pretty fresh.", "This is called Transfer On Death Deed. Very handy in this situation.", "Do NOT do this.  Change the locks, sure, but keep your interest in the property.  If cousin gets hit with an anvil, it could go to someone else.", "Or put it in a trust.", "Nope nope don\u2019t do this. Keep your name on the title", "We here at AITA take the dog tax very seriously and need to see some of these puppers as soon as possible", "Mods this is a bot", "NTA. But maybe slow down on the brother jokes. She might not like the idea of her brother mauled by dogs. Even if he brought it on him self", "I sent my cousin's lawyer an email already, but historically here, the courts have not really charged property owners.", "Not just US. Here in Toronto if you aren't around/can't control your dogs and the police show up, well, you can guess. It happens often enough. I almost feel like my cats would be more of a problem lol.", "I would fill in the lawfolk in the town about the incident. On the premise of showing a funny video. But now they know BIL as a trespasser. And change the locks in case BIL is dumb enough to try it again and/or wife wants to hand the key over to him again.", "I don't know where OP is from, but the \"Beware of Dog Sign\" means shit in Canada, at least Ontario Canada. As stupid as it is, you can be held liable legally and have your dog put down for it attacking someone breaking into your house and doing what dogs do. Again, I don't agree with it, just saying check your local laws.", "be sure to duct tape a piece of laminated paper behind the word Dogs that reads 'MANY' for good measure /lh", "This varies by jurisdiction, where I grew up on Long Island it had legal president as an admission of owning a dangerous dog. So you would be considered at fault if someone was bit.", "No worries, thank you for being worried about the dogs safety.", "No woods density where I'm at(unfortunately). Only one corner has trees, aside from that you can essentially see the entire property from the other three \"corners\". It's not flat either, it dips in which is why our range set up works.", "INFO is literally IN the POST \ud83d\udc80 why are you doubling down and just being more wrong??", "Banning someone from a property after they justify people breaking into the property is actually not very uncommon and definitely not in any universe a threat.", "Where I am in Canada it counts as an asset for separation but she doesn't necessarily have ownership rights, the law is weird. So, if they divorced, she would be entitled to half the value but not necessarily half the property. \n\nAnd the thing is, OP is TA for banning her. But he is NTA for banning her brother. My SIL owns a cottage, my husband and I are not entitled to use that cottage, especially if my BIL had already said no.", "There are some pretty smart dogs out there, dude.", "Wouldn't surprise me.", ">Certainly talk to a lawyer or a financial advisor on how to protect yourself.   \n>  \n>Also-I know this sounds nuts, but check what your insurance says in case a trespasser does get bit. Depending on where you are you may be financially exposed", "All the dogs are surprisingly scared of cats to some extent. The mastiff mix is the biggest and got the shit slapped out of him by a maine coon. He instinctively runs when he sees the cat on the fence.

Bleh.", "This sounds really wholesome and I'm glad the dogs have a better life. How long has this been going on for?\n\nThat said, the cameras can only show you so much, and really, how often are they checked? If a dog is injured and lying down... you're not going to know it's injured. You're also not going to be able to tell if a dog accidently ingested something or is having digestive issues because you don't know who's poo belongs to who. Ultimately, they sound happy and healthy but there's a big possibility something could go wrong.", "You must be new here if you don't know what INFO means on Reddit.", "And how do you enforce that ban?\n\nThere's only 1 way to enforce it: with the police.  Clearly, its an implied threat.", "Hes the TA for banning her, hes the TA for purposefully taking his time while his brother in law was hiding from his pack of dogs scared.  Hes TA for mocking him over it\n\nMost of all hes TA for leaving up to 9 dogs loose on this property only getting checked on once every two days.  Ive had a dog die in the country from fighting a coyote, my partner had a dog die when it chased down a porcupine, you cannot leave a pack of dogs loose in the country and not be TA.  Supervise your dogs or dont have them, his wife is right.", "I had my cat in a house with a rott mix and I swear my cat could intimidate that dog. They never got in a fight but if my cat was trying to do down the stairs and the dog was in the way he'd move lol", "My toughest dog is my smallest mutt (about 45 lbs, and with only three good legs); my biggest, strongest, toughest-looking dog \u2013 an 85 lb cane corso mutt \u2013 is a total fraidy cat, but he's got one hell of an intimidating bark. Anyone who tried to break into my house would almost certainly be scared off by his bark and appearance long before they could get close enough to see him run and try to hide from them.", "I think since my house was there when we raised the chicks she knew they were part of the pack and thus didn't feel the need to address them. \n\nWe live in an area where there were regularly visiting hawks and eagles and other predators, so pigeons would just like hang in people's yards. My dog was never cool with that (we also never experienced the gopher problem neighbors had).", "> How long has this been going on for?\n\nHm, I believe the mastiff is the oldest at 8, but I believe we started doing the \"farm\" living around 4+ish years ago? We had some of the dogs as house pets before hand, I mentioned I had to take the csttle mix for long as fuck walks. It took a good fucking whike to get them adjusted. Shit like eating in their own lane, proper poop spaces for the lot of them, etc.\n\n>how often are they checked. \n\nThe vet that checks our neighbors horse comes out twice a week. They have like bredding horses or some shit from my understanding, he checks the dogs. He mostly focuses on horses now but he has enough experience with dogs that we trusted him. He has someone he recommends locally as well that comes check them twice a year just incase. And for personal checks, we check them when ever we can. Dogs are weird, the seemingly grow nails at different paces. We learned that real quick. So we check them every time we see them because of that. You're right about poo to an extent, but like I mentioned they don't really stray fsr from their house. We can mostly see where theybare and if a poop looks weird, we can just test it. We have nkt had any issues these last few years", "They go to the property once or twice a week, rotate through the dogs so they\u2019re all getting human interaction multiple times a week, and pay someone to check on their food/water three times a week", "Im aware what it means, it\u2019s just stupid that you post it when there is clearly no info needed.

Definitely sound experienced!", "At first, your setup was confusing because I too thought, \"How can you not snuggle your dog's every day?!\" (I've been conditioned by a mini dachshund for endless belly rubs) but through reading your comments, taking in rescues, and they are well cared for; I think it's a great solution for some dogs that may not have good homes otherwise. Especially for a high energy breed - you see posts now and then of people who get huskies in little apartments and walk them for 30 mins a day, and wonder why they tear the place up \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So out of ALL the INFO posts, it's mine that you got an issue with? \ud83d\udc80", "Oh ok, thank you!", "Lhasa Apsos were bred to bet Tibetan temple guards.", "Yeah dude, I used to have to take the cattle mix on 3-4 hours walks when I took her in.

His cousin has no relation to his BIL and the decision was made between the BOTH of them. Even if it wasnt owned by both of them, his choice of not giving permission has no bearing on respect what so ever. My own BIL isn't a bad guy, but I wouldn't let him fish my property without me there with him. Liability is an issue and if you're a lurker of this sub you've seen for yourself how much familial relationships can mean. Just because he's been a decent guy now doesn't mean he wouldn't sue the crap out of someone."]}
