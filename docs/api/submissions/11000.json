My mom (59F) and aunt (63F) are upstairs with my grandmother and the ambulance has been called. \n\nWhen I was 5 years old, my mom underwent 3 major surgeries in a year and I was singlehandedly raised by my grandmother for that time. My dad was never around due to substance abuse, she was my 2nd primary parent. \n\nToday, I came with my mom to see my grandmother as I do weekly and her state deteriorated much faster than we anticipated. She was having an unconscious seizure, hallucinating and lost about 10+ pounds. I burst into tears and left the room. My mom & I are very close, and I know she is struggling with the impending grief and I am her main support system. \n\nI feel awful for leaving, as I type this I\u2019m shaking and crying still. I feel sadness, guilt and fear I am missing my ability to say goodbye even if she cannot hear me. I am freaking out, the sight of her seizure is burnt into my brain. \n\nAITA for leaving the room and staying downstairs in the basement as I cry alone?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone, especially the person who told me to hold the door and the person who DM\u2019d me to tell me even unconscious they can hear. I decided to go back upstairs and when I walked in she was declared dead. I held her limp hand and apologized and thanked her for everything.", "created_utc": 1677444221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11cs3py/aita_for_leaving_my_mom_and_aunt_alone_to_deal/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seeing a loved one on death's door is a very painful experience. Most likely, none of your family members blame you for being unable to handle it.", "NTA\nWe all deal with grief in a different way. When you\u2019ve collected yourself go and give your mother a big hug because I\u2019m sure she needs one.", "NTA I went through somewhat of the same situation and before my loved one passed, I was told by ny aunt that it\u2019s best to keep the last image of that person a good one.", "NTA. It is a traumatic experience. Don't feel guilty if you are not able to. She has your mother and your aunt and won't be alone. And you were there every week. That is what matters. If you are a religious person, may consider to pray for her. If not just take your time. Open the door when the ambulance arrive so your mother or aunt don't have to leave your grandmothers side.", "I hope that you can take a deep breath, pull it together, and just be there, for yourself, grandma, mom, and aunt. You don\u2019t have to say or do anything. Just be there. It\u2019s hard and you\u2019ll be so relieved down the road that you did.\nNTA because it isn\u2019t the right word. I hope you can find the strength to be there for yourself while you walk your grandma out. \nHearing is the last thing to go. Hang in there. You can do this. Sending strength to you all.", "NAH. What you're feeling is perfectly normal. The weight we put on interactions with the dying is usually for the benefit of the living rather than the dying person, including goodbyes. You don't need to subject yourself to further trauma that benefits no one.", "NTA you also have grief and need to grieve. Take your space.", "NTA. Everyone grieves differently. Allow yourself to grieve in whatever way is helpful and healthiest for you. I am sorry for your loss. Your grandmother sounds like she was an amazing woman.", "NTA\n\nEveryone deals with grief and a dying relative - especially one as close you you appear to be with your grandmother - in different ways.  Just be there for each other when you each need each other.", "NTA I would try to spend as much time with them as you can though.", "Oh darlin. I spent 30 years in a field where I saw a lot of tragedy & death and many is the time I wanted to bail and several times I had to take a few moments as soon as the crisis was over so nobody saw me cry or throw up\n\nNobody knows what they're going to do the first time they encounter death up close and personal. The people that are shaming you need to be ashamed.  \n\nYou see yourself as running away but I see you as stepping away so that your mom did not have to deal with your agony as well as her own. The point is you came back. And the even bigger point is that your grandmother loved you and your mother loves you and you had some big trauma growing up and neither of them would have ever felt anything for you in that moment but love and compassion.\n\nIt's not what we do in the last moments of someone's life that counts but what we have done all through their life and I think you can rest easy on that score. I wish you peace.", "NTA. Everyone deals with loss in their own way. Sounds like your mom has your aunt with her for now, so she's got some support. You do what you have to do to take care of yourself. I'm sending you a big internet hug.", "I\u2019m sure many people will probably have a different opinion on this when my father came home from hospice to pass away none of our children, or the grandkids were able to see him they were eight under, they visited him a week before he came home. We took them to the hospital to visit with him because he still looks like grandpa, so for the last week of his life, we did not allow any of the kids to see him. We did not want their memory of him to be what he looks like just before his passing, we wanted their memory to be of who he was, and what he look like and what he did with them while they were growing up. So you running out of the room that doesn\u2019t mean that you still can\u2019t be a great support system for your mother you just chose not to have your last vision of her in that state and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "Sitting with my beloved father, holding his hand, as his breathing slowed and eventually stopped was the hardest, most important, most meaningful thing I have ever done. It wasn't traumatic, just heartbreaking. \n\nBut sometimes, it isn't peaceful; sometimes, it *is* traumatic. And regardless, not everyone can do it.\n\nI seriously doubt that any of your loved ones are criticizing you over it. The most important thing is that you loved her, and she knew that, and she loved you, and you know that.", "NTA. You witnessed something extremely traumatizing.", "I had a similar experience when my grandma died. Your grief is yours alone and you are 100% allowed to grieve in the way that works for you. If you need space, take it! When my grandma passed, my aunt, mom, and grandpa were in the house with me. If you can say goodbye, do, but you don't *need* to go back upstairs. Grandma knows how much you love her. \n\nAll that said, it's definitely normal to support one another when a loved one is dying. But your mother is an adult, and she should be getting emotional support more from adults than from her child. *Even if you are an adult child.* She needs to do her grieving in a way that does not prevent you from being able to do yours. I gently suggest you should attend a grief support group. See if Mom will go with you but if not, you might want to attend on your own. I found sorry groups really helpful when I lost family members.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
