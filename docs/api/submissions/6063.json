Our job was it to transport my patient to the hospitals emergency department quite quickly. Not an absolute emergency but it would not bother if it would be fast. The wife really wanted to stay on her husbands side which would be okay for me. As we entered the house though, the lady was really mad and unfriendly and rude towards us, the doctor or even her husband. Also she demanded that we would have to transport him im his own wheelchair and not on our strecher- which is absolutely not possible. I have to ensure the safety of my patient while we drive. I can't do that if there is a large object in my ambulance that it's not supposed to be there.  As we moved the patient in our rig, she refused to wear a mask and kept on complaining about the wheelchair situation. I told her that we would like to be quick and that they have wheelchairs at the hospital. Also I wasn't sure wether the emergency department allowed anyone else but patients in their rooms bc of COVID. At some point she just ignored me, so I said I don't want her in my ambulance and closed the door infront of her nose. \n\nDid I act correctly?
