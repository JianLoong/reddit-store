You are free to associate with whoever you like, but yes you definitely the A here.  It doesn\u2019t come across like you are just looking out for her best interest.  It just seems like you\u2019re being super judgmental and jealous of her wealth or something.  Bizarre stuff.", "None of what you said is a valid. People with age gaps can have successful relationships. YTA", "How good are her 'food looks' ???", "Yes. Prenup prenup prenup because, if I'm not mistaken, when she inherits the business it will be considered marital property. That's sketchy territory.", "They are just been so vague it just comes down to they don't like it that is all.", "I really don't feel comfortable describing it.\n\nCan I say he is touching her and saying things that belong in the bedroom rather than public/family gatherings.", "Since he is the CEO of the company Mia is now working for maybe he has a lot of money.  This way Mia isn\u2019t worried about someone marrying her for her money.", "Here is a list of red flags you missed\n\nHe was her boss power dynamic is off\n\nthey got pregnant and engage in less than 2 months of dating \n\nhe is groping her and making nsfw comments in public \n\nhe has a lot to gain by marrying her", "Have you asked her* if she dislikes these comments, etc?", "Tbh, there can be a huge economic difference between being the CEO of a successful firm and being the owner", "From experience, it's sometimes that it's so humiliating that it's easier to say you're okay with it. \n\nWhen you say you're not, people get very motivated to help you leave, and if you're not ready this can end up alienating friends. \n\nThis isn't how it should be, and everyone's experience varies; this was just mine.", "Yes,  but OP is going on about money.  No one has said how successful her families business is or if it is in financial difficulty?  If she has siblings? Or how big of business he is CEO of (maybe he owns or a family owns the business).  \n\nOP acts like Mia is a child who has no common sense, can\u2019t take care of herself, or isn\u2019t mentally capable.  Maybe Mia is the one who wanted a child now and the ex didn\u2019t want kids.  Maybe Mia initiated the whole relationship and got pregnant on purpose?  Did Mia and Mike know each other before she went to work at his company.  Maybe they were having an affair behind her exs back and that was why she broke off with Derek.\n\nOP is judging the relationship without knowing details that are important and is making assumptions.", "Sure, more information is needed, since OP has provided (Imo) too many opinions and not enough (objectives) facts.   \nI was just pointing out that there is often a huge difference in the economic compensation you get  as a CEO vs what you gain as a shareholder"]}
