It was a chocolate pie. Anna offered me a slice and I turned it down, as I am not a fan of such food, however Anna insisted and Edna chimed in. I politely accepted a slice.

I then asked my wife if it would be okay if I tried some of the whipped cream to enjoy with the pie , she silently passed me the cream. I know I made another sound, but it was just a nice \"mmm\" sound- again to show my pleasure.  Edna soon left the table and my wife followed. I assumed for grieving reasons.\n\nOn the car ride home my wife told me how I made her 94year old grandmother so uncomfortable as I was moaning loudly and repeatedly at the table. My wife said it was over the top and her grandmother called it \"vulgar\". \n\nI told my wife I was not moaning sexually over the pie, however she did not believe me as she said I moaned harder after she passed me the whipped cream and I made a scene at the wake, moaning \"sensually\" over chocolate pie and whipped cream while licking my lips and fingers (I'm sorry, is this a crime?).

That's some backwards thinking imo.\n\nI would still apologize (mostly to get more of that pie), but I honestly don't think that OP is TA at all here. Edna should take it as a compliment!", "\u201cEdna left the table l\u2026 I assumed for grieving purposes.\u201d \u201cI was not aroused by the pie.\u201d Lol so funny", "It certainly was apple and thats about 15 sec of my life I will never get back LOL", "I've never in my life felt the urge to moan when eating something.", "It's a wake, ffs. They're grieving; making sex sounds at a wake is horrific.", "\"OH I see, so IM the asshole for smacking my lips like bugs bunny to show my appreciation!?\" \n\nIt's a funeral bro...\n\nMaybe I'm too harsh on people, but you really shouldn't make an impression at a funeral unless it's like \"he was so kind and helpful\" or \"He woke the corpse up\"", "Every funeral I\u2019ve been to has had food afterward?", "At the wake, not funeral. \n\nOnly attended one in my lifetime, had the church viewing and service, burial at graveyard, then refreshments at the family home which was mostly family and close friends.", "That's what I'm thinking! Maybe I havent been to enough funeral but I've never eaten at one ever.", "Agreed. For the love of pie!", "Sure but on the other hand he got weird looks at the first Moan clearly indicating that it made people uncomfortable\u2026. And then he did it again", "Well you need to eat more delicious food \ud83d\ude1c", "And licking fingers is just disgusting", "Then don\u2019t serve good food?", "Yeah I\u2019m not gonna go to a funeral if there isn\u2019t an after party", "Yeah, afterwards, not at the funeral.", "Yeah, I'm from the deep South, people cart in food enough for an army when someone passes. The funeral is a solemn occasion but pre and post gatherings are usually full of laughter AND tears. I've never seen food served around the deceased. A luncheon following burial is not the funeral.", "He got one blank stare from Edna (that he noticed). That would not be enough to signal me that I was being too loud. They could've also told him to tone it down instead of spreading the word to everyone. Like, they're the ones who decided to not say anything to OP and then go off and make it public knowledge? Why is it OPs fault that the wife is embarrassed by the family's gossip?", "Redditors would sooner die than exhibit the tiniest sense of self control. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me making sex noises at your wake, don\u2019t serve good food!\u201d", "After party? \ud83d\ude02", "After party? \ud83d\ude02", "Why? For those shitty little tasteless boiled egg sandwiches and burnt coffee? Nty.", "A wake takes place after the funeral\nAlthough I just read that sometimes the body is present so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb idk", "In the Midwest, funeral potatoes are served in many a church basement.", "No, redditors would sooner harass someone for a harmless reaction to good food than not get offended by the stupidest of shit.", "Yo soy fiesta", "And after the party is the hotel lobby.", "A wake precedes the funeral", "Good old funeral potatoes!", "Depends on the [family](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)). \n\n>A wake is a social gathering associated with death, held before or after a funeral. \n\n>In parts of Britain and some other parts of the Commonwealth, where it is not customary to have a public viewing ceremony before the funeral, the term has recently come to mean a gathering held after the funeral."]}
