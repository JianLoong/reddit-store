It was a chocolate pie. Anna offered me a slice and I turned it down, as I am not a fan of such food, however Anna insisted and Edna chimed in. I politely accepted a slice.

I then asked my wife if it would be okay if I tried some of the whipped cream to enjoy with the pie , she silently passed me the cream. I know I made another sound, but it was just a nice \"mmm\" sound- again to show my pleasure.  Edna soon left the table and my wife followed. I assumed for grieving reasons.\n\nOn the car ride home my wife told me how I made her 94year old grandmother so uncomfortable as I was moaning loudly and repeatedly at the table. My wife said it was over the top and her grandmother called it \"vulgar\". \n\nI told my wife I was not moaning sexually over the pie, however she did not believe me as she said I moaned harder after she passed me the whipped cream and I made a scene at the wake, moaning \"sensually\" over chocolate pie and whipped cream while licking my lips and fingers (I'm sorry, is this a crime?).

At the same time, I\u2019ve seen people do it and it seems completely natural and instinctual for them so I can\u2019t exactly blame them. I think media has maybe made moaning while eating a more sexual thing?", "I\u2019ve been known to moan or \u201cmmmm\u201d over food. But not at a wake. And the finger licking is too much unless you\u2019re at home, or at someone\u2019s house that you know really well.", "This is why I\u2019m really confused. Maybe OP is calling it a wake but it\u2019s really the reception after a really conservative funeral/memorial. That might explain the reactions. Sr. Eileen would have pissed herself laughing if someone had enjoyed her dessert so well at Sr. Charles\u2019 wake\u2026but they\u2019re very much Irish Catholic Nuns having an Irish wake.", "Not at the funeral itself but sometimes there's a thing you go to afterwards with family + friends with food and you just gather together to talk about the deceased and just be with each other during mourning.", "im joking btw", "\"We'll just tell your mother we ate the pie.\" Eugene Levy is a national treasure. Or in this case international treasure?", "Good one\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Lol I\u2019m old. Hair pie is a reference to Revenge of the Nerds lol", "Shoot, thanks.  I'm not sure what went wrong there.  I'll fix it.", "I understood this reference \ud83d\ude33", "Oh god, thanks for the warning xD", "Ok, but by telling me *not* to google something, it just makes me want to google it more. Throw me a bone and give me a tl;dr to sate my curiosity?", "I can't help but make happy sounds when that first bite of delicious food hits. I also just really love food, cooking, everything about it.", "I hold it in well when with other people,  but i'd be lying my little ass off if i tried telling you that i don't let out a moan of sheer pleasure when i'm eating red phoenix plums.", "I feel a little sorry for you\u2026", "FFS they weren\u2019t sex noises you pervert.", "Yea. Im wondering now if wake is the same thing in NA as ireland.", "He\u2019s one of our national treasures for sure \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6", "I was speaking about this thread in general not specifically your comment.", "Seriously? You know allot of cultures eat with hands?", "I'm from New Orleans and we have a lot of loud funeral traditions, but wakes and the funeral proper are generally pretty sombre affairs, and the loud part (sometimes a second line, almost always a repast) comes after.", "Yes, and I have spent a lot of time among such cultures. But that is entirely different from licking your fingers ostentatiously.", "I know this whole post and comment thread is about food, but I actually like them because cause there\u2019s always a weird sort of energy that makes people act kinda goofy", "Got \u2018eeeem!", "IT'S A FUCKING WAKE. People are in mourning, no one gives a shit if the pie is good. In fact most people eating the pie are probably experiencing *sadness* because it's the favorite pie of the DECEASED, when they eat it they think about their loss! When people eat a deceased loved-one's favorite food and cry they aren't tears of joy! Exhibit some respect.", "It\u2019s not disrespectful to express that you like the damn pie lol. Everyone grieves differently, he doesn\u2019t have to act like everyone else to grieve. I didn\u2019t cry once at my grandfathers funeral because I\u2019m not a crier. I\u2019ll also add that plenty were laughing and smiling as we remembered my grandfather. There\u2019s no right way to grieve, get off your high horse. If this is how the family is gonna act OP would be best to get out of that relationship asap, they\u2019d probably complain about every move he ever makes.", "Yes, people in *your* family had a happy \"remembrance\" funeral. OP's *partner's* family wanted a \"grieving\" wake. You adjust toward the closest relatives of the deceased. You were one of the closest to your grandpa, not some random who may have never met them. No one needs to make themselves cry, but if you do something and multiple people *including the mother of the deceased* STARE at you... DON'T DO IT AGAIN. If you want to express that you like the pie then SAY it. Moans and grunts aren't distinct expressions of singular ideas, *words* are. And seriously, licking your fingers in public after eating ***PIE***? Certified child", "You\u2019re the child if you\u2019re gonna give someone shit for licking their fingers, I guarantee you do that shit all the time unless you\u2019ve never eaten food lol. His moans were expression of enjoying the pie, nothing sexual, nothing weird, and certainly nothing to warrant the reactions he got. That\u2019s a major red flag."]}
