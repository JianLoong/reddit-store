I then asked my wife if it would be okay if I tried some of the whipped cream to enjoy with the pie , she silently passed me the cream.

Not actually shitty or anything, just weird.", "I dont think you were being an asshole, but I also dont see why youd wanna die on this particular hill\n\nId stand on, \"I wasnt doing anything wrong, but I apologize if I made anybody feel weird\" and then just never worry about it again because its literally not a big deal", "Soft YTA because of the type of event this was.

Apparently multiple people heard you so, you were louder than you think.", "YTA Good gross. Not only were you moaning, but licking your fingers??? That\u2019s disgusting behavior anywhere, but especially inappropriate at a wake. Apologize immediately.", "Um you can control this reaction especially at a wake, it's a bit over the top, and licking your fingers IS very bad manners for a grown man and an older generation would definitely not like that. Get a napkin and if you want to express your \"pleasure\" you can say \"Wow this is delicious.\" Going with YTA.", "My BIL groans loudly at the table over the food. I find it so off-putting.

It's a completely voluntary action that no one and nothing makes you take, and the more expressive ones are some of the most annoying sounds a person can make.\n\nIf you were moaning and licking your fingers to the point that multiple mourners noticed and took offense, I think we can all see/hear in our minds exactly what you sounded like. The time/place matter, coupled with the fact that it was completely unnecessary when you could have just looked up and said \"this is excellent\", and then proceeded to use a napkin or wash your hands like an adult, makes you a major asshole in my books.", "I'm picturing an episode of food wars, with all the moaning.\n\nYTA, I think \ud83e\udd23", "It's rude to lick your hands and fingers.

Bad manners.", "Saying an episode of Curb could also make a great episode of Seinfeld is like saying an apple pie would make a great apple pie filling.", "The first time I ate pana catta, I cried like when a kid gets a new puppy.", "This! I love good food, and I will comment on how delicious it is, but I don't moan. Even someone saying, \"Mm, that's really good,\" to me anyway, is not moaning unless you draw it out in a breathy kind of way-- which, from others' reactions, OP seems to have done. Also, since it was apparently a \"somber\" wake, he should apologize. I'd put moaning over food more than once, especially at a 0lace of grieving, right up there with belching and passing gas.

I'm in my mid/late 30s now with more life experiences to see the situation better. At the time it was much harder to understand.", "Looking back now, I agree with you.

And, if helps round out the  sad emotions of the funeral itself!", "NTA why make her favorite pie if no one is going to enjoy it at the wake?", "Seeing as multiple people noticed and commented on whatever sounds you produced, it probably sounded nothing like you intended.

So, maybe apologize.", "Gonna have to taste the pie to decided", "Whenever I have to mmm after taking a bite of delicious food I usually say like \n\n\u201cMmm, this is Delicious\u201d just so it\u2019s not seen as sexual or anything of the sorts \n\nBut yeah \n\nNTA", "Any way to get the recipe?", "NTA You were just enjoying the pie lol.

Mmmm...no, nta.", "NTA I am picturing someone moaning while licking away at the spoon in the middle of a quiet, grieving room lmao! Hey, any wake I have ever heard of people were getting drunk, laughing and talking about the deceased. Was that wrong?", "I had to go back and look at the ages because I thought this was my old friend, Dylan. He did the same thing. I've heard it's involuntary for some people. Idk. NTA though. Granny sounds like a fudd.", "NTA \nWakes are not 100% a solemn occasion. I\u2019ve been to a lot of them. There is crying and hugging and storytelling and laughing. If someone brought some great tasting food, a groan or two isn\u2019t inappropriate.

This is just weird and while I think NTA I DO think you should just apologize and move on with your life.

A velorio is a wake and a wake is a velorio. Referring to any event called a \u201cwake\u201d in English (even if laughter and stories are shared though I\u2019ve never associated that with a wake) I\u2019d use velorio if speaking Spanish. They both refer to the same historical pre funerary tradition and the words themselves even both have the same root referring to \u201ckeeping vigil\u201d over the body of the dead.\n\nI\u2019ve also never been to a wake that wasn\u2019t a very somber occasion for mourning with weeping, grieving, soft voices etc so I\u2019m having a hard time picturing one with laughter! I\u2019ve been to a lot of wakes in the US and to me it\u2019s an immediate indication that this will be a more old world/traditional grieving process with organized religion involved. When I hear it about a celebration of life my mind goes in the exact opposite direction.", "I don't know about this one. I'm a vocal enjoyer of food and I don't see anything weird about being exuberant about it, sighing or whatever. But multiple people independently complained about it being suggestive. Coupled with the licking, maybe OP was being more suggestive than he thought.", "Hard agree", "You had me in the first half...", "Bahahah life would be so much better if it was run by pie", "Yeah, this is the first I\u2019ve heard of a wake being a sad, solemn event. I thought wakes were basically post-funeral socializing events with food, beverages, & laughter. Late great Aunt Helen was probably up there \u2b06\ufe0f laughing her ass off at the killjoys\u2019 reactions to his pie-eating appreciation.", "Or the office like when Kevin has to say \"Oh yeah\" every time after biting into a chocolate bar lmao.", "It only had one bite, and it was above the rim and on top of a magazine! And it had the doily on it!!", "I grew up in East Los Angeles. But I was surrounded by a number a different parishes\u2019 nuns. (French Belgian, S.American, Mexican, and worldwide RSHMs that included the Irish ones who taught us about \u201cwakes.\u201d)\n\nA velorio is holding vigil yes, and saying the rosary together and praying together. Before this thread, my idea of what a wake is was the complete opposite. Many of the nuns were older and I went to many funerals/celebrations of life/memorials starting in my tween years\u2026the Mexican/S.American ones were so very sad and formal and there were so many tears. But the Irish wakes were so joyful and wonderful and you totally ended up crying too, but because you knew the person who passed would have had such a good time celebrating and singing and eating chocolate pie (Heh.) Someone mentioned they took place before the funeral and lasted days\u2026but the ones I went to happened after the funeral/mass because the body might be taken back to Ireland yo bury depending on the nun\u2019s family. When my aunt passed, also a nun, her remains were sent to the Motherhouse in Mexico City, but the velorio snd funeral mass were still held here. Because she was so beloved in her community they had a big reception afterwards which filled my mom with so much love and wonder\u2026but was also very solemn and sorrowful. \n\nSo yeah, I guess because of my non-standard upbringing the words are not interchangeable to me\u2026weird that it\u2019s taken this long for me to realize it\u2026", "I want to gag whenever I see anyone lick their fingers. Most finger-lickers don\u2019t wash their hands before or after the experience, and it\u2019s so foul. If you\u2019re that desperate for more of a food, just get another slice. Also, if you\u2019re the type of person who insists on licking your fingers, for the love of god\u2014 don\u2019t do it in public, especially when other people aren\u2019t eating?? Imagining this whole scene makes me feel so embarrassed for his wife.", "Well yeah, because it's bad manners.  Napkins should have been available.", "And now my top is covered in red wine BUT \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m not even mad about it", "No."]}
