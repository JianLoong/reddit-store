More turkey and stuffing  for you\ud83d\ude42", "Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "Don't make them choose (and it's clear you aren't) but I'd present it along the lines of not being comfortable with her doing being there so you're opting out for this year.", "In this case you are NTA because her dog is not SD or ESA. She needs to leave her sick dog home or not go at all.", "Then NTA. If it's not an ADA service dog then it needs to stay home.

I would makes sure I had an extra set of clothing to change into before I went home to my own dog. \n\nAlso\u2026.how much does she love the dog that it wasn\u2019t vaccinated? The vaccine is very effective. Weird that a kennel would not require the vaccine. \n\nNTA", "I see I wasn't too far off.", "Again you both have the same philosophy. You\u2019re both invited and you both want to bring your dogs because they\u2019re family to you both and if you can\u2019t bring your dogs for whatever reason, you don\u2019t want to go.

Shared toys, shared water bowl, nose to nose, etc. If they dog is still \u201ccoughing\u201d after 2 weeks your cousin should be concerned about pneumonia. Again, if the dog has already had a round of antibiotics, it\u2019s no longer contagious. It\u2019s a 10 day course of meds. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t skip Thanksgiving. I just wouldn\u2019t allow my dogs to have contact with the other dog if it hasn\u2019t had any meds. Tell her to bring a crate.", "OK so NTA. You don't bring a sick dog to someone's house when they also have a dog. That's common sense. Your cousin can't bring the dog so she can decide to come alone or stay with the dog. It's easy enough, being a dog owner means you do some annoying stuff at times but it's still great overall. If your family is the toxic no common sense kind to make a whole deal out of a mole hill then really just let them. What is more Thanksgiving-y than family feuds?! But joke aside, don't allow them to make it into a \"Oh you're rejecting your cousin, how dare you, you know she is a poor fragile thing, blablabla\" and just say like a broken record \"The dog is contagious, so she comes alone or doesn't come\". Don't add any more argument because they will take any opportunity to turn it into an attack on her character.", "So listen, just like you want your dog there so does she. Your the one with the issue so if the parent with the sick kid comes then I would not bring my child so they don't get sick. Your the one with the issue, not her.", "I would agree, but the way the family processes it I guess I\u2019m the AH?", "Exactly! And the daycares response when she told them was oh yeah we had a few cases but thought it would go away. This dog is allowed back at daycare. \n\nNo regard for others, and a bad dog owner lol", "It really isn\u2019t and this is the mentality that irks me. \nYou\u2019re both invited yes. You both want to bring dogs yes. If she doesn\u2019t bring hers I won\u2019t bring mine and poof both dogs are safe.\nThat\u2019s where you don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re saying me wanting to protect my dog is the same as me going to events with a highly contagious respiratory infection with regards to others. \n\nDon\u2019t think you\u2019re right here so it\u2019s whatevs lol", "I wanted her to just leave her at her house for the 3-4 hour dinner. Her dog is also an asshole and steals toys and drinks water from other bowls.   \n\n\nIts an airborne VIRUS, and youre saying that antibiotics, which are for bacterial infections is why she isnt contagious?   \n\n\nAgain, its about the risk. WHY RISK getting the dogs sick?!", "Exactly is my point. I have to move my dog somewhere else so that she can come with her sick dog. \n\nI have already gotten so much shit for asking her to leave her dog at home. She\u2019s visiting from another state so I said leave the dog at your parents house so they don\u2019t have to be in contact. And she refuses. \n\nAnd everyone is just like but she\u2019s sick she needs the dog she needs blah blah.
