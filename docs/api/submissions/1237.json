I have one sister, and my aunt and uncle do not have any children. However, my uncle got married about 3 years ago, and his wife, Mary, has 3 kids. Her kids have barely made an effort to be a part of my uncle\u2019s life, although he does see them from time to time because they have a good relationship with their mother. They have made even less of an attempt with the rest of us. I\u2019ve never even met them. My grandparents have tried to get to know them but with little luck. \n\nMy grandparents bought a fairly nice house when I was a baby. I was unaware until a few weeks ago, but it seems that their plan was always to sell the house whenever they got ready to move and split the money among their grandchildren. I guess my dad and his siblings will get whatever is left in their will, so this is how they wanted to set up their grandchildren. They\u2019ve saved a good amount of money for themselves, and now they\u2019re moving into a retirement community. They sold the house, and my sister and I are each getting about $250k. \n\nThis is really useful for me and my husband. We\u2019ve been looking to get a bigger house because we\u2019re about to have a second kid, so it will allow us to put a sizable downpayment on that, and still have a lot to go into savings. My sister plans to pay off her student loans and then put most of it in savings as well. We\u2019re really grateful obviously to our grandparents because we both really feel like this will set us up well for the future. \n\nMy uncle called me yesterday and said that Mary is very upset because her children were not included. She says that they are my grandparents grandchildren now too and deserve a cut. My grandparents have basically said it\u2019s up to us if we want to share, but that they left it to us for a reason. \n\nI\u2019m torn, because we had plans for that money. If they had made any effort at all to be \u201cgrandchildren\u201d to my grandparents, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate, but they didn\u2019t even meet my grandparents until they were in their late teens/early 20s and they have made little effort since. \n\nWIBTA if I didn\u2019t share?", "created_utc": 1667575820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym20i7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_money_from_my/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
