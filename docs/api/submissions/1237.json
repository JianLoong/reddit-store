I have one sister, and my aunt and uncle do not have any children. However, my uncle got married about 3 years ago, and his wife, Mary, has 3 kids. Her kids have barely made an effort to be a part of my uncle\u2019s life, although he does see them from time to time because they have a good relationship with their mother. They have made even less of an attempt with the rest of us. I\u2019ve never even met them. My grandparents have tried to get to know them but with little luck. \n\nMy grandparents bought a fairly nice house when I was a baby. I was unaware until a few weeks ago, but it seems that their plan was always to sell the house whenever they got ready to move and split the money among their grandchildren. I guess my dad and his siblings will get whatever is left in their will, so this is how they wanted to set up their grandchildren. They\u2019ve saved a good amount of money for themselves, and now they\u2019re moving into a retirement community. They sold the house, and my sister and I are each getting about $250k. \n\nThis is really useful for me and my husband. We\u2019ve been looking to get a bigger house because we\u2019re about to have a second kid, so it will allow us to put a sizable downpayment on that, and still have a lot to go into savings. My sister plans to pay off her student loans and then put most of it in savings as well. We\u2019re really grateful obviously to our grandparents because we both really feel like this will set us up well for the future. \n\nMy uncle called me yesterday and said that Mary is very upset because her children were not included. She says that they are my grandparents grandchildren now too and deserve a cut. My grandparents have basically said it\u2019s up to us if we want to share, but that they left it to us for a reason. \n\nI\u2019m torn, because we had plans for that money. If they had made any effort at all to be \u201cgrandchildren\u201d to my grandparents, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate, but they didn\u2019t even meet my grandparents until they were in their late teens/early 20s and they have made little effort since. \n\nWIBTA if I didn\u2019t share?", "created_utc": 1667575820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym20i7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_money_from_my/", "score": 872, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If money weren't involved they would be perfectly happy not being grandchildren.", "NTA\n\nThey've made no effort to be family until suddenly there's money involved and it's all faaaaaaaaaaamily!!!!!!\n\nKeep the money your grandparents gave you and ignore the screeching leeches", "NTA. If you guys are just handing it out to random people I'd like some...", "NTA\u2026nope, don\u2019t share.  The money is rightfully yours and your sisters.  And don\u2019t feel bad about not sharing.  These kids have not earned a place in your grandparents lives.  And it seems you do t have much of a relationship either, so, if they are mad, no big loss on your part.", "BTA\n\nThey\u2019re just being greedy. Don\u2019t let guilt manipulate you into doing the wrong thing. Logic makes it obvious that you keep the money, and enjoy your new home, guilt free!", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nRemind them that it\u2019s not because they\u2019re not biologically related. It\u2019s because they\u2019ve never made the effort to have any sort of relationship.", "NTA they didn\u2019t care to be apart of the family until money way involved don\u2019t give them anything", "NTA they are adults that have thier own grandparents, they are not adopted and were not young when they joined the family, your uncles wife us being a money grabbing ahole, do not give them a penny.", "NTA\nDo not give a SINGLE CENT to those people", "NTA if you don\u2019t share the money. Your grandparents knew what they were doing.", "LOL!!! NTA of course. They are not \"grandchildren\" and as you said, they've never even tried to make an effort to interact with the family. Mary and her kids are just being greedy. I had an Aunt very similar. Married my Uncle and she already had a 20 something year old daughter. Right off the bat, she tried to insert herself and control family functions. Her daughter was also barely around. Color her surprised when her daughter wasn't left anything when my grandparents died. Other grandchildren weren't left anything, either but we already knew that any inheritance would go to my father and his siblings. For some reason she thought her daughter would be different. She was also miffed that my father got the family property, even though her husband (my uncle) and the other siblings got money. My family (dad, mom and brother) were the ones who stepped and helped my grandparents with upkeep and all the other siblings had moved hours away anyways and the property was something they knew my father wanted because 1. sentimental reasons and 2. logically it made more sense because it made him more accessible to his clients and put my mom much closer to her own mother that she was also helping at the time.", "NTA if you didn't share.\n\nIts the grandparents choice and decision, and the kids don't want a relationship with said grandparents.\n\nIdk why they expect money to come from a relationship they never wanted.", "NTA but I gotta say, your grandparents are for pushing this off on you.  They made their decision they should stand behind it.  Instead, they threw you under the bus.  Let them deal with Mary's rant.  She's wrong & they are weak.", "NTA. Mary's children aren't your grandparent's grandchildren - they have Mary's parents as their grandparents, and their bio dad's parents as grandparents. Simple as that.", "NTA. Theoretically they have two other sets of grandparents to leave them and inheritance. I'd ask Mary if you'll get a share from her parents and see what she says since you are her nieces.", "Your grandparents are still alive. They made their decision. This decision isn't from an old Will they forgot to change after your uncle got married. \n\nI suspect they would be disappointed if you split the money. \n\nIf Mary has a problem, she should be talking to them not you. Though she shouldn't be talking to them anyway.", "Amazing how $$ makes family stick their hands out! NTA\nDon\u2019t do it-there is no way you can do it in any way short of equal portions for all (which is wholly uncalled for!!!) that they will find acceptable, so you\u2019ll be the bad guy anyway! No, no, no!! Your grandparents are alive and if they wanted to do this differently, they would have\u2026 sadly, by giving it to just the two of you, they also handed this conflict to you. They just don\u2019t deserve it\u2026", "YWNBTA neither you nor your sister should feel obligated, or even inclined, to give a \u201ccut\u201d to your step cousins. They came into the family as adults/near adults and made the choice to want to stay connected presumably to their blood family, not get closer with their new blended family.", "NTA\n\nHis wife\u2019s children who have no relationship with your relatives are absolutely not \u201cgrandchildren now too.\u201d They can\u2019t walk up to people they made no effort to know with their hands out.\n\nTell your uncle that when his parents die. He can give his wife\u2019s children his own inheritance.", "NTA keep it!  Money makes people ugly.", "NTA You are 100% within your rights to tell them to pound sand. If your grandparents wanted Mary's kids to be included, they would have cut them a check. I love what your grandparents did for you and your sister, but I REALLY wish they had simply told your uncle no from the start. It wasn't fair for them to push the decision on to you...but I am sure they are lovely people who just didn't want to deal with their son's nonsense.", "NTA.\n\nThey aren\u2019t your grandparent\u2019s grandkids. Partly because they were adults when their mother married your uncle but mostly because they don\u2019t really consider themselves a part of your family (which is fine) and have behaved accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously a money grab by Mary. Who knows if the kids even have an opinion about it.", "NTA. You would be gifting money to literal strangers. If your uncle is so pressed, he can share his inheritance once they pass.", "NTA. Her children presumably have a father and an entire two sides of a family. If you had a close relationship with them it would be one thing but no.", ">so it will allow us to put a sizable downpayment on that, and still have a lot to go into savings.\n\n\nNTA. I think it's wonderful that you can use the money to improve your life but I would consult with a lawyer before making all the money a joint asset with your husband.  Your worried about your \"cousins\" potential getting some but you will be loosing half to your husband if you get divorced.", "NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nI have a stepmother, she's nice and we have a good relationship.  I would find it very strange her parents gave me any inheritance.", "NTA  Mary has a dose of false entitlement.", "NTA", "NTA! They are not your family and if your grandparents wanted them to have anything they world give it to them.", "NTA. Don't you dare give those kids anything!! How entitled. And your aunt is a bloody gold digger! Give them nothing as they deserve nothing", "NTA - do not share. Your grandparents aren't dead, they have consciously decided who to gift their money to, your uncle needs to talk to them, his parents, not you. Go do what your grandparents wanted and do good things for your immediate family.", "NTA. Mary and her kids came late to the game. They are not your grandparents grand kids. Uncle can give them whatever he gets when they pass.", "NTA.  Your grandparents made their decision.  You have no obligation to share.  I wouldn't give them a dime.", "NTA No freaking way should these people get any money! Grandchildren my ass! They are strangers to all of you. Talk about entitled. I don't even know you & I'd be mad I'd at yu if I found out in an update you or your sister gave them anything! Hell no!!!!", "Lol! Money grabs make me laugh. They're not family, they're just bystanders hoping to get a little cash handout. If they're nothing to you now they're going to be nothing to you later except they'll have some of your money laughing behind your back. NTA!", "NTA. Your money, your choice. The uncle can share HIS money with HIS kids. It\u2019s not your job to give cousins money. The grandparents gave it to you.", "NTA\nThat money is for you from your grandparents.  Mary\u2019s kids are NOT family and giving them any of the money would be 100% disrespectful to your grandparents.  Keep any money left over to invest for your own children!  Mary\u2019s kids have their own grandparents & they are none of your business.  Just because she married your uncle doesn\u2019t make her kids your family!", "NTA. Family isn\u2019t determined by blood it\u2019s determined by actions. They made zero effort to get to know your grandparents or spend time with them. They are adults they could have taken them for lunch had dinner with them but they chose not too not till there is something in it for them. Keep the money it\u2019s yours.", "Don\u2019t give them a cent. If your grandparents wanted to make allowances for them they would have. NTA", "NTA - they're only \"family\" now because there's money involved, go away you broke bastards \ud83e\udd23", "Absolutely NTA. Don\u2019t share. They\u2019ll only make any effort until they get what they want.", "NTA. Why would you be torn on this? Your grandparents\u2019 money has nothing to do with Mary\u2019s kids. Why on earth would you make your life worse to benefit these randoms?", "Of course not. Your grandparents have made it clear who they wanted to help, and it wasn't someone else's offspring that they don't even know. NTA", "As stated, the rest of your grandparents money will go to their children, so your Uncle will have money to pass onto his kids at a later date.\nNTA", "NTA", "I Agree NTA!!  \n\nEven if that only been part of the family for the past 3 years, they have not actually tried to be part of the family. They have not wanted to interact with or get to know anyone from your side of the family at all. No one has a right to have hurt feelings when they are the ones who have chosen to not participate.", "Grandparents are still alive and gave the money early.", "NTA. These people are strangers. I would ask the aunt, \"So when grandma and grandpa get older, your kids intend to help take care of them? To sit with them at the hospital, if needed. To clean up their house, or cook, or take them to doctor's appointments. They're going to financially contribute monthly to the care of them as well, if needed. RIGHT? Or would they NOT because these people are complete strangers to them, have no relationship, and only pop up when they think they can get money off of them?\"\n\nDo not give these people a cent.", "If the grandchildren hadn't received money then the Uncle's wife wouldn't have brought up that her kids are grandchildren too.  NTA.", "They didn't want anything to do with the grandparents until there was money involved, NTA, not a penny, not one red cent are they entitled to. This is literally the consequences of their own actions, or inactions as it were, nothing more.", "God, you see this so often, these types of people are like hogs to the trough.  Sickening.", "Don't forget that those 3 other kids have their own grandparents", "It's not even about a will, though---the grandparents downsized, but they're still alive!", "It's not even about a will. The grandparents are alive and they actively chose who they gave money to from the sale of the house.", "The grandparents aren't even dead yet! Just selling their home and gifting the profits to their grandchildren.", "The grandparents are still alive. This isn't part of the will. They chose to just split it between OP and her sister. NTA", "The grandparents are alive. They sold their house and gave the money to OP and Sister.  Grandparents have a will that names their own children as beneficiaries.", "The grandparents are still very much alive. Did you even read the post?", "There is no issue relating to the grandparents'  wills. They're still alive and simple gave this money to their grandchildren as a gift. Just want to clarify that. \n\nOP is NTA - there is no legal or other reason to expect adult step grandchildren who have no relationship with grandparents would get a cut. Mary is living in a dream world.", "Agreed! Mary is a greedy AH and it does not even sound like OP's uncle is a father figure to her kids so I'm guessing he's never lived with them and has not adopted them either. To them he's probably not dad or even stepdad, but mum's husband. Expecting his parents to treat these strangers like their own grandchildren is wild entitlement. Don't feel guilty OP this money was always meant for you and not uncle's wife's children you've never even met! \n\nNTA!!", "Mary's kids are NOT the OPs cousins, nor are they the grandparent's grandchildren. They aren't entitled to squat", "You just know that if all the grandkids had to take turns caregiving for Grandma and Grandpa, those \"new grandkids\" would be nowhere to be found.", "They probably still don't want anything to do with the grandparents, just want the money.", "VERY good point!!!!!!", "NTA. If they wanted to be treated like family they should have acted like family. Asking for money is never the appropriate way to start a relationship. Your responsibility is to your own children not some strangers you've never even met.", "Her kids have chosen to not be part of the family! They don't interact with your grandparents, they don't interact with you and your sister, they are choosing to not truly be part of the family. As such that's what they are, not part of the family.\n\nYou are NTA!", "Too right!!  Heck they're not there to just hang out and get to know them.", "NTA.  The \"kids\" invested nothing into your gps.  YOU did.  YOU loved them your entire life.  Why should you share THAT?", "NTA fuck that, they want the money, not the relationship.", "NTA. Don't share. They don't deserve any of that money.", "NTA - your grandparents made their choice, the money is yours and her kids don't give a shit about being \"grandchildren\", they just smell money.", "NTA\n\nYou and your sister the one they left the money to and stated they had reason for it.  Now that it\u2019s your money you do as you please. You and your sister should keep the money with no guilt.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nMary is an entitled AH. Her kids are nothing to your grandparents due to their own choices. Keep the money."]}
