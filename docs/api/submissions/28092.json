B and A aren\u2019t in a relationship, but had hooked up once previously in a messy situation. it was very nice to see B, but she was in bad shape and i ended up having to take care of her for most of the weekend (buying her food, making her eat, getting her free drinks, etc.) i had also let this friend sleep in my bed back home for 8 months when she was kicked out of her house about 2 yrs ago. i was more than willing to help her out, but i feel like there has been no boundaries since.", "created_utc": 1696275860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16y68qr/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_friends_for_having/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you expected them to leave your apartment while you were working. So does it bother you more that they stayed rather than what they did in the time? Because I still cant see what the big deal is about that.\nAlso from what that sounds to me, they are a hopefully soon to be couple. Im not surprised they couldnt leave their hands off each other. Didnt you pick up anything from the two?\nId say that he brought her with him is already sus. :D", "JFC\n\n>i had expected them to take advantage of that rather than fuck in my bed\n\nIts about OP being upset they fucked in the bed....", "JFC what is wrong with you?!", "NTA - But it sounds like B is in a really bad place with the death of her dad and A is taking advantage of that.", "NTA.
