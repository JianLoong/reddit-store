So I decided I would make my own wedding dress, which I've been working on for over a year now. It's almost done minus  some glamour points to really make it stand out from any other dress I've seen.\nMy Mother (54 F), has been bugging the ever living heack out of me to see my dress. I figured this was because: 1. She had never been married herself.\n2. We never did the traditional dress shopping at a boutique.\n3. I've been extremely secretive about any details about my dress.\n\nWell after 8 months of my mother asking everyday either via text, call or in person about my dress \"does it have have sleeves?\" \"What kind of neckline did you choose?\" Etc.. I decided maybe if I give her a tiny taste she might tone it down a little on the constant questions. So i told her the dress is NOT complete yet but I sent her 2 pictures of my dress (on my sewing room mannequin) front and back, and told her she would have to wait until my wedding to see the finished dress.\n\nSo I sent her 2 pictures last night about 9 pm thinking that would calm her down and I went to bed....\n\nI got to work this morning and was checking my socials before heading into the office, when I came across a FB post from my mother of the 2photos of MY wedding dress I had sent her last night. There was no context to the photos, nothing saying \"my daughter beautiful wedding dress\" or \"my daughter is almost done with her dream dress.\" Nothing! People were already commenting on the photos, congratulating her, saying they didn't even know she was engaged.\n\nI saw RED, I reported to photos to Facebook stating she didn't have permission to post them, and I called her (it was 5:30 in the morning). She picked up the phone and I lost it, telling her that if she posted the photos anywhere else she better take them down, and she'll be lucky if she's even still on the invite list for the wedding.\n\nMy mother doesn't think it's a big deal because like I told her the dress is not finished so she didn't spoil anything and my dress will still be a \"surprise.\"\nI don't know if my fiancee saw the post or not before it was taking down but he does have my mother on his friends list and he goes to work and hour before I get out of bed, so the possibility is there.\n\nSo AITA or am I justified in being pissed off?", "created_utc": 1699280481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p3srl/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_for_posting/", "score": 429, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's sad to see people so addicted to social media comments and likes that they'll vaguepost THEIR OWN DAUGHTER'S wedding dress.\n\nShe needs to be on a no-information diet from here on out.", "NTA but your mom knows no boundaries. Keep her on an information diet from now on so she doesn\u2019t try to make your wedding hers.", "NTA is your mom stupid? Like are Facebook likes more important to her than your wedding dress reveal moment? Selfish. I\u2019m so sorry op", "NTA. Your mother is being obtuse. She may never have been married, but surely she knows that noone, especially not the groom, is supposed to see the dress till the wedding day? You made one mistake: You caved by sending her those pictures. You should never have done that. That is good to know and to remember for another time. I mean there could be pregnancies, gender reveals - all sorts of interesting things your mother is unable to keep to herself and therefore should not be told about.", "NTA. She should have asked for permission before posting. Very poor taste. Congrats on the upcoming nuptials.", "I mean, justified.  NTA.  Even if you don't believe in the superstition of bride/wedding dress before the wedding, most people still like for it to be a surprise for most of the attendees.  The fact that she didn't even mention anything and was taking \"credit\" would have also infuriated me.  Maybe you overreacted a bit, but I think she stole your thunder.  Just like my younger sister, I told her that I was having my daughter (It's a girl) and she told EVERYONE ELSE.  I didn't get to share that with my dad.  She stole my thunder.  It HURT.  So I get it.  NTA.", "NTA. This is a huge betray she did just to get likes. Uninvite her from the wedding until she really appologice for what she did.", "NTA. That was a huge violation and she should apologize.\n\nIf she refuses to apologize, keep that in mind any time you have some news to share. She might post it all over Facebook before you even hang up the phone.", "NTA. Your mom had no right to share without your permission.", "NTA. Perfectly justifiable.  Your mother needs to be on a very strict information diet.  Tell her that she'll be lucky to find out where your wedding is being held at all.", "NTA, I have to wonder what on earth she was thinking?? I mean, at least a caption like \"what a talented designer\" could almost maybe seem like she's trying to compliment you out of pride - I'm drawing a very long bow because I try and see the best in people but I'm honestly struggling. You are totally within your rights to yell at her and rescinding her invite would be justified, but a somewhat nuclear option.", "What kind of numbnut shares a bride's wedding dress photo on social media before the wedding has happened.", "NTA - but your mother is TA. If she wanted to post pictures of your wedding dress, she should have asked for your permission.", "Nta. No wonder she's never been married. Resentment and jealousy grows deep. Don't share anything else with her. I wouldn't even invite her to the wedding, no telling how more unhinged she will become.", "NTA and you're more than justified in being pissed off.", "NTA\n\nYour mum knew that you wouldn't want them shared so she didn't provide any context.  Sounds like she is playing some weird game.\n\nBut if you were that secretive about it why on earth would you send anyone photos of the dress?", "NTA, that wasn\u2019t right of her", "NTA, but how clueless are you to send mom pics?  Knowing her personality (based on what you've said), you should have seen this coming.  The most you should have done is let her have a peek (from across the room at your house) AFTER you took away her cell phone and under your close supervision.\n\nI agree with those saying uninvite her and put her on an information diet until she recognizes how inappropriate her actions were and that boundary stomping will not be tolerated.  If she truly shows remorse and apologizes - and there are no more breaches of etiquette or boundaries - she MIGHT be able to earn an invitation back.  But maybe not.", "NTA - I'm surprised you didn't expect that; why else did you hold off for so long?", "Has your mom always tried to sabotage things for you? NTA", "NTA\nYour mother ia beyond selfish and frankly jealous. Downgrade her this instant: no more information about the wedding,  take away any \"privileges\" she would have had as mother of the bride (like sitting at the top table), let everybody know she deliberately shared your dress without your permission.  She's bitter and she's going to make more of her wedding about you if you aren't careful.", "NTA. No one should ever post anyone else's personal photos without their permission, and a wedding dress is about as personal as you can get. Nobody should have to tell their mother that. It is just common sense.", "NTA. Tell her you changed your mind on the dress you are making, and send her pictures of something else. I think \"cinderella wedding dress extreme\" would hit the spot.", " NTA. This is actually bonkers. It\u2019s such a violation but it\u2019s one of those ones that seems relatively harmless so you end up looking silly getting so mad about it. I do think it will be ok in terms of your dress & wedding but there\u2019s really no way to undo the damage. The fact she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal is really the icing on the absolutely toxic cake. My guess is that it isn\u2019t an isolated incident. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a valid reason to cut off your mom, but depending on what she\u2019s done in the past, I\u2019m not sure it would take much more. It shows a kind of disregard that is really unacceptable for someone who is supposed to care for you. But you have learned a valuable lesson about sharing things with her. Don\u2019t.", "NTA... You mom was stupid to do that. She must have known better, no one is that dense.", "NTA but a bit over the top perhaps by threatening not to invite her.", "NTA. Now you know how she is. Tell her from now on, all secrets will be held from her. No more information to her until you are ready for the world to know", "Nta maybe invest in some therapy because it sounds like a toxic relationship with you and your mom. Is she jealous of you and wanted to spoil your good moment ?", "Ngl I really wanna see the dress now\u2026", "YTA, but only to yourself.  There were far better ways to handle this the whole time that would have resulted in both a) you getting what you wanted, and b) you not having to spend emotional energy on the whole thing.  Oh, and c) would help prevent similar situations in the first place.\n\nSounds to me like you know exactly how your mother is, and exactly what would happen if you gave her these photos.  It also sounds like you haven't learned how to set boundaries. \n\nYou're 34 years old.  Mom can't 'bug the ever living heck out of you' unless you let her.\n\n\"Mom, you'll see my wedding dress at my wedding.  Stop asking.  If you keep asking, I'll be blocking your calls and texts for a while.'\n\n> I decided maybe if I give her a tiny taste she might tone it down a little on the constant questions.\n\nYou're also quite old enough to know that this is utter bullshit, and that giving in to pestering and pushing only begets more pestering and pushing.\n\nHonestly, sounds to me like you were hoping for a chance for a big explosion so that you could 'justify' laying down the law to mommy, when the whole thing could have been avoided the second time she asked.", "NTA.
