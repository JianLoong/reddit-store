So I decided I would make my own wedding dress, which I've been working on for over a year now. It's almost done minus  some glamour points to really make it stand out from any other dress I've seen.\nMy Mother (54 F), has been bugging the ever living heack out of me to see my dress. I figured this was because: 1. She had never been married herself.\n2. We never did the traditional dress shopping at a boutique.\n3. I've been extremely secretive about any details about my dress.\n\nWell after 8 months of my mother asking everyday either via text, call or in person about my dress \"does it have have sleeves?\" \"What kind of neckline did you choose?\" Etc.. I decided maybe if I give her a tiny taste she might tone it down a little on the constant questions. So i told her the dress is NOT complete yet but I sent her 2 pictures of my dress (on my sewing room mannequin) front and back, and told her she would have to wait until my wedding to see the finished dress.\n\nSo I sent her 2 pictures last night about 9 pm thinking that would calm her down and I went to bed....\n\nI got to work this morning and was checking my socials before heading into the office, when I came across a FB post from my mother of the 2photos of MY wedding dress I had sent her last night. There was no context to the photos, nothing saying \"my daughter beautiful wedding dress\" or \"my daughter is almost done with her dream dress.\" Nothing! People were already commenting on the photos, congratulating her, saying they didn't even know she was engaged.\n\nI saw RED, I reported to photos to Facebook stating she didn't have permission to post them, and I called her (it was 5:30 in the morning). She picked up the phone and I lost it, telling her that if she posted the photos anywhere else she better take them down, and she'll be lucky if she's even still on the invite list for the wedding.\n\nMy mother doesn't think it's a big deal because like I told her the dress is not finished so she didn't spoil anything and my dress will still be a \"surprise.\"\nI don't know if my fiancee saw the post or not before it was taking down but he does have my mother on his friends list and he goes to work and hour before I get out of bed, so the possibility is there.\n\nSo AITA or am I justified in being pissed off?", "created_utc": 1699280481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p3srl/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_for_posting/", "score": 1778, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you don't believe in the superstition of bride/wedding dress before the wedding, most people still like for it to be a surprise for most of the attendees.  The fact that she didn't even mention anything and was taking \"credit\" would have also infuriated me.  Maybe you overreacted a bit, but I think she stole your thunder.

Downgrade her this instant: no more information about the wedding,  take away any \"privileges\" she would have had as mother of the bride (like sitting at the top table), let everybody know she deliberately shared your dress without your permission.  She's bitter and she's going to make more of her wedding about you if you aren't careful.", "NTA. No one should ever post anyone else's personal photos without their permission, and a wedding dress is about as personal as you can get. Nobody should have to tell their mother that.

The fact she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal is really the icing on the absolutely toxic cake. My guess is that it isn\u2019t an isolated incident. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a valid reason to cut off your mom, but depending on what she\u2019s done in the past, I\u2019m not sure it would take much more.

There were far better ways to handle this the whole time that would have resulted in both a) you getting what you wanted, and b) you not having to spend emotional energy on the whole thing.

No more photos of anything onto Facebook, and let her know you are checking her account daily to make sure. For that matter, can you access her account somehow, eg on her phone, and change the account info so she can't log back in, until you change it back after the wedding when there's nothing further to spoil? She also gets to be on a strict information diet going forward, and where appropriate, is now the last person to learn new information.\n\nHowever, I want to ask about something I haven't seen addressed in the other comments. You say she pestered you daily for eight months (so roughly 240 times) asking for information about the dress. How did it get to that high a number of times, without you saying something to her? Or did you, but she just ignored it and kept asking, and you didn't try again? This suggests to me this is a regular pattern of behaviour for her, that you have been dealing with for years. Have you seriously tried hard to address it? You know that because it works for her, she will keep doing it, yes? Have you thought ahead to what happens if you decide to have children, and once you are pregnant she wants to announce it even though you want to wait three months? Or, she decides she wants to know what the name and/or gender of the baby is, even though you want to keep that information to yourself? Or you have any other significant life event that you want to keep to yourself for a while but she wants everyone to know about?\n\nThis kind of thing would drive me insane, and it sounds like it does for you as well. In your position, I would address this behaviour head on, now, so you don't have to deal with it for the rest of your life. The guidelines for how to do so are readily available on r/JUSTNOMIL but I'll list them here: \n\n1. state clearly to her (verbally, and send a follow up text so she has it in writing) that you are done talking about the subject and will not entertain any further attempts to raise it. If it is during an in person conversation, you will walk away. If it is during a call, you will hang up. \n\n2. the next time she brings it up, do it. Throw her out if she is in your home (it may be easier for this phase to meet her elsewhere) or if you are meeting her at her home or in a public place, get up and walk out. If you are on the phone, hang up. Just say, \"I told you this subject is closed\" and exit the conversation.\n\n3. if she still continues bringing it up, before exiting the next conversation as set out above, tell her you are putting her in a two week time out. Mute (or block) her on your phone and don't answer the door if she comes to your home. Don't respond to her in any way, until the two weeks are up. If she sends any flying monkeys your way (ie she complains to relatives and asks them to speak to you on her behalf) message her that the timeout has reset to zero and the two weeks will start afresh from that day and then re-block her. \n\n4. resume communications after the time out ends. If she still brings it up, the next time out is three weeks, or four. Flying monkeys mean a reset to zero on the timeout counter. If she keeps doing it after that, the timeouts are for longer and longer periods of time.  If you think they will listen, explain what you are doing to any flying monkeys. If they understand they may help you out. If they don't understand, mute them too. \n\n5. keep this up for as long as necessary, until the behaviour finally stops. It may take quite a while, depending on how stubborn and persistent she is, and how long she has been used to using it to get her way. Beware the extinction burst (refer to r/JUSTNOMIL for examples) and if at any time in the future you catch her starting to use it again, it is an immediate time out for her. \n\nGood luck.", "That was extremely rude of her and childish. Do you think that if you had included her from the beginning or some of the planning stages like the design / sketching, she wouldn\u2019t have done this?", "Going a little against the grain here but ESH. \n \nBoomers aren't exactly social media mavens and you called her at 5:30am, probably waking her up from sleep and without giving her time to process or a chance to explain or have a discussion, you blew up on her.\n\nWas she in the wrong for posting without your consent? Yes, absolutely. Did you deal with in a mature way...not really. \n\nMaybe there's more at play in your overall dynamic but you could probably both use some work on how you communicate.", "YTA. Wtf is with brides, seriously. Nobody cares, except you.", "NTA. I wouldn't have given in like that; I would've continued to ignore her questions, no matter how annoying.

Done. Undone. It doesn\u2019t fucking matter.\n\nAs someone who sews, I saw red reading this.", "NTA. Mom sounds like she needs everything to be about her.", "Nta", "NTA. You are justified in being angry about this. This just proves that your instincts about your mom are accurate - do not trust her about anything.\n\nImagine how surprised she will be when you announce the next big event in your life and she only learns with or after everyone else in your family. She has created this situation with you. Protect yourself and your plans from your mom.", "NTA this would get some put on a very strict permanent informant diet.", "NTA but your mother is. She should not have posted those photos! It was very rude and inappropriate of her to do that.  In the future I would not trust her with any other type of secret. \nNot baby announcements, baby names, (if you plan on having kids), new home pics etc. Good grief. Mom was wrong!!!", "NTA Your mom is selfish and horrible for this. She KNEW  you wanted it to be a surprise to everyone", "NTA. I agree with others speculating that this is likely the latest in a long line of boundary stomping by mom. \n\nYou would have to have been living under a rock since the beginning of forever to not realize that revealing the wedding dress publicly before the wedding is a no no. \n\nSounds like it might be worth going LC with momma for your own wellbeing.", "NTA- No one should post pictures of your dress before the wedding! How could she possibly think this was acceptable.  I thought before reading the post, she put them on FB after the wedding because she wanted to share to family and friends.  Tell her to post the dress she is going to wear, not yours.", "NTA I would be livid", "NTA\n\nAlso not cool possibly showing this to the groom since it's social media....", "YTAz you'd ruin a relationship with your mother over a fucking dress. You're spoiled. When your mother is dead and gone, I hope you remember how you yelled at her over a dress. Disgusting, feel sorry for your husband to be.", "My mom intercepted the first copies of my wedding photos. Looked at them with my husband, then printed the ones she wanted, photocopied them into a fucking collage and mailed them to the entire extended family. I didn\u2019t talk to her for 8 months then moved across country. It was the final death stroke for our relationship. I am stubborn so I haven\u2019t looked at them. It\u2019s been 8 years I\u2019ll probably do a fun 10 yr photo shoot and go all out.  \n\n\nNTA she knew better.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is a psycho", "Mother of the bride was clout chasing. NTA", "I don't think we're missing anything we can't accurately glean from the post.  OP's mom has no sense of boundaries, and I'm sure OP has lived with that their entire life.", "What context do you feel you need to think what? The mom was wrong to do as she did. Plain and simple. What would make that change for you? We don\u2019t need their life story.", "Actually no right to share period. It. Not her wedding and not her dress", "She didn\u2019t overreact.", "Jeez, that\u2019s a little much.", "No but I also didn't think I had to tell my mom not to post photos of my incomplete wedding dress 1 hour after showing it to her.", "When I first got engaged before I decided to make my own dress I asked her on multiple occasions if she wanted to go to dress stores with me and she always declined so I did try to include her from the beginning. After I decided to make my dress was when I sort of stopped not because I was trying to be secretive or excluding her but because I was just really focused on getting my dress done.", "That\u2019s a bit dramatic\u2026", "Mom needs to be on an information blackout for the rest of the wedding.", "What kind of numbnut shares a bride's wedding dress photo on social media before the wedding has happened.", "Agreed which is why this was a clear NTA but refusing to show your mom your wedding dress for 8 months sure does make me curious.", "I already voted NTA so I dont need anything, i didnt know it was so wrong to be curious about a situation.", "Similar - my father died at 1 am, and my mother and sister were there with him. They called to let me know right away. When I got up at 7 am, there was already a several hours old, well-commented post on Facebook saying RIP with a pic of him posted by a distant friend. That's why you call close family members immediately no matter what time it is, so they don't find out from Facebook that a loved one has died and everybody knows but you.", "Well you should have learned your lesson now unfortunately. No more information. She can't share what she doesn't know or doesn't have.\n\nNTA", "You don\u2019t sew, do you?", "Unfortunately it's super common with the types of parents who vicariously live through their kids. The issue I always have with parents doing stuff like this is they never seem to understand how they are making their kid's big moment about themselves. It's toxicity.", "Considering her mom ran to her FB to post about it, it's pretty understandable why OP withheld information. A mom is not entitled to pictures of a wedding dress and certainly not a mom who acts like this.", "You say that like OP's mom DIDN'T just run to Facebook and share pictures of her dress.", "She\u2019s making her own dress. There may have been very little to show for several of those months.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if she had the version she sent a picture of that whole time. She might have thought it was pointless to send a pic of some random cloth before that time.", "It makes me curious too. Why hold out for eight months and then show her the whole thing now? Regardless, NTA and no more info for Mom. Mom needs to be taught boundaries.", "Good lord. And I thought my mother was bad. The amount of kvetching over the fact that we don't put our kid's face on social media sends me right over the edge (rant incoming). I am SORRY, but the generation pulling this nonsense didn't have to raise their kids in a world with social media, AI, digital identity theft, surveillance capitalism, the psychological fallout of being an influencer's kid, catfishing, and tech giants monetizing big data and machine learning data sets that is built on the backs of information and pictures we willingly upload to the internet. Parents right now are in the fucking trenches here trying to make good digital privacy decisions for our kids in a world where the landscape completely changes every five years.\n\nHowever this is also the same woman who basically did not let me watch popular TV through high school, and now complains because I didn't let her download apps for my six-month old, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.", "[deleted]", "I say it like someone who loves reading about other people\u2019s drama.", "It was not the whole thing, still a lot to do on it, she sent her the pics hoping it would get her to stop annoying her about it.", "Piles of fabric aren't as interesting as a semi-completed dress", "Mom is probably on an info diet because anytime someone let's her in on a secret or surprise, she blabs to the first person for the attention. \n\nThough, if I was OP, I would have sent mom a fake dress then called her out on her own post once it was posted.", "I know it wasn't the completed project, but she sent front and back, enough that it was a spoiler when her mom posted it. I would've just sent a close up of the fabric or the neckline or something if anything.", "She can't be trusted with anything else.", "Yeah me too, I bet she wishes that's she had done as well. Although probably wouldn't have stopped her nagging her for more \ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\n\nyour mom sounds like the kind that never really processed the whole \"becoming an adult\" thing. Sorry you have to deal with this \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA and from now on only send her fake photos. There are literally hundreds of FB sewing groups that you can.cadge pics from to send her. Let her embarrass herself with them.", "NTA - Time for an ~information diet~", "I\u2019m shook \nYou are DEFINITELY not the asshole", " Nothing in your marriage is LESS important than your wedding dress.  Absolutely no one will notice.", "I think you wildly overrate how important the reveal of your wedding dress is. It means a lot to you, but to everyone else, it\u2019s another white wedding dress that even your most devoted friends and family will forget about forever shortly after they see it. Don\u2019t let this ruin your wedding.", "Nta \n\nHave our fiance unfollow her so he doesn't see what see post from now on unless he goes to her page, just in case she gets a photo from someone else", "You\u2019re not the jerk Op. I would have been so mad too. Once a picture is uploaded to Facebook, their policy claims they own it not you. However you can report the photos and have them taken down and all that for personal property violation of sorts", "NTA", "YTA\n Not because what your mom did was OK, but because of your reaction. Calling her to scream at her in the moddle of the night? Threatening her? I guarantee you when you were growing up you ruined more than one experience for her. Gain some perspective.", "Fake, I just read this story on r/bridezillas this morning with a few details changed.", "Nta your mom was out of line to post the photos", "NTA.\n\nYikes... your mother is really living vicariously through you. How sad.", "NTA and I\u2019d consider uninviting her from the wedding.  At the very least you should strictly limit her involvement.  She has no boundaries, she makes everything about her, she kept hounding you and refused to take No for an answer, and then instead of hearing you she minimized your feelings and didn\u2019t apologize.  Good luck.", "NTA- it\u2019s not her dress and not her place to unveil it, for lack of a better term, to everyone", "\u201cInformation diet\u201d - that\u2019s a new one for me! Love that.", "I\u2019m doing an info diet with my mother, who is trying to make my wedding into the dream wedding she never had. It\u2019s not helping. She just sends post after post of \u201csuggestions\u201d and telling me I need to invite xyz and yadda yadda. Nothing has gotten her to just shut up and be supportive.", "I dont think her mom is stupid. I am getting major narcicissts vibes instead from her. Posting a wedding dress without any information is a huge red flag because most people would assume that you are the one who is getting married.", "She doesn't trust her mother. And she was correct not to. That's why she didn't show her mother the dress.", "The real question is why her mom kept hounding her about it.  NO boundaries.", "I agree! My mother and sister shared photos online after my wedding and ruined my first childs birth by posting it almost immediately after giving birth. I was still w/ docs when my hospital room phone started ringing w/fam & friends", "Her mother who has never been married ran to Facebook to post pictures with no context, and now has people congratulating HER on a wedding that\u2019s not hers\u2026", "> My mother and sister shared photos online after my wedding and ruined my first childs birth by posting it almost immediately after giving birth. \n\nYou're giving me something to look forward to that I never considered, oh my \ud83d\udc80. My mother pulled the exact same thing with my wedding. It was an intimate elopement, parents and siblings only, and my mother was taking pictures on her iphone, trying to get us to pose and the like. We *had* paid for a great professional photographer, by the way. When we went off for the portraits (not even an hour after the ceremony!) she posted her shitty phone photos on facebook, so instead of relaxing I was dealing with phone calls and messages from the extended family/friends. \n\nWe had told everyone that we were going to do a formal announcement once we got the professional photos back. To this day, the only professional photos that she's seen are the ones my MIL posted (with permission)."]}
