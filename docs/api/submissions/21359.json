Or your kids?", "NTA. If your husband sides with the kids, he can cook for them. You're not their personal chef. As a parent, you have to provide them with food. If they are old enough to make themselves a sandwich and there is stuff to make said sandwich, you've done your job.", "NTA\n\n>My husband is on the kids sides and thinks I am being a petty jerk\n\nHusband can grill today and then cook all meals in the future. Problem solved.", "NTA, so far. Unpopular opinion, probably, but I suspect that you're not doing your kids any favors by catering to them so much. And I say this as a mom with kids who have sensory issues. Refusing to eat spaghetti because it's not angel hair is ridiculous. I get texture issues, one kid will even throw up if something hits her wrong. I have still never gone to the lengths you seem to be. I make sure to prepare things that I know my kids *can* eat. If they decide that's not for them, I always had baby carrots with ranch dressing, today with peanut butter, or cheese sandwich available. Note I said \"available.\" Not \"made and brought to them.\" One kid, if they had to make something else themselves, was much more likely to eat what was served. The other learned to cook for themselves pretty early on (middle school, with supervision). I'll offer a thought, too. Both my kids are still seen as \"picky\" eaters, but they are not brats about it. I have a relative who is both picky and a brat. Do your kids do this when eating out? At someone else's house? Basically, is this how they are 100%, or is it something they are doing just to you?", "NTA. You probably should have done this a long time ago. You and your husband have created this behavior but it\u2019s not too late to fix it. They are all old enough to prepare meals for themselves so if they don\u2019t like what you make, they can go right ahead and do so. Hold the boundary and in the long run it will make them much more pleasant people.", "NTA\n\nThe way I was brought up? You either eat what you\u2019re served, unless you have a dietary restriction for a medical reason\u2026 Or you don\u2019t eat at all.\n\nI\u2019ll probably get down voted, but that\u2019s how I grew up and I turned out fine.", "NTA. 10 is old enough to learn how to cook. The rule at my house growing up is we have one option for dinner and if you don't like it, there's peanut butter in the cupboard and you can make yourself a sandwich.", "If I didn't like what my parents cooked I could make myself a sandwich. Me... not my mother.", "NTA  does your husband have 2 broken arms? Tell him if he wishes to support this nonsense he knows where the kitchen is. It's ok for a kid not to like some things - we all have something we don't like - but it seems like it's escalated to the point you're cooking all different meals. They'll get over it.", "Sounds like hubby can put an apron on, lol. NTA", "NTA. Dealing with picky kids whose tastes are inconsistent at best is frustrating enough. But adding an unsupportive husband on top of that? Big nope.", "The youngest is 10.  Sounds they\u2019re old enough to make their own meals!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou get what you get, and you don\u2019t get upset.\n\nIt would be one thing if you had a kid that was allergic to peas, and then you put peas in the dinner. But they\u2019re just being weirdly demanding for no real reasons. It\u2019s also not as if you have a child that has tried, say carrots multiple times, and really really hates them and then you can continue to try and put carrots in everything. \n\nI won\u2019t eat spaghetti unless it\u2019s served with garlic bread? What is that nonsense?\n\nNo m\u2019am!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA. It\u2019s time for the kids to start taking turns making dinner (or helping make dinner).

My mum used to call this domestic terrorism because my brothers seemed to coordinate their dislikes even though they didn't get along. One liked carrots and hated potato, the other like potato and hated carrots. They would eat a meal over and over and then one day decide they hated it.\n\nYour kids are old enough to make themselves a sandwich. Don't make things they definitely won't eat, but don't go out of your way to meet their \"requirements\". Get them involved and teach them how to cook so they can make their *own* meals if it's a problem.\n\nDo not negotiate with the terrorists.", "NTA. I grew up being told \u201cthis isn\u2019t a restaurant\u201d and I\u2019ve learned that parents create the picky eaters. Show them some life skills like making their own food if they don\u2019t like what you cook. Simple things like a sandwich, scrambled eggs (my 10 year old niece makes them), stuff in the air fryer. Then they can decide if they want to do that or just eat what you cook.", "You're completely in the right. They make a game out of not bei9ng satisfied just to create drama.\n\nThe dining halls at Yale have an interesting policy about picky eaters. The meal line offers students a choice of three dishes. Anyoine who doesn't care for any of the three can help himself to a loaf of bread and jars of peanut butter and jelly.\n\nThat'\\[s it. Three dishes don't work for you? Have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, just like the contestants on Big Brother who lost a competition.\n\nNTA", "Your kids are picky eaters because you made them that way. It's good that you are finally putting your foot down, better late than never, else they'll end up being the typical adults who can only eat 3 things for the rest of their lives.\n\nNTA. Whoever complains, hubby included, can make their own food (no matter how tired or bad they may be at making it).", "NTA.  You're not starving your children.  Your house isn't a restaurant, and you're done making a bunch of different meals every time you eat together.  My sister was picky AF growing up, and my mom still never made her a completely separate meal.  At most, she might separate out some ingredients before putting everything together for the rest of us, but my sister was still given a plate of food with the same basic components as everyone else at the table.  My mom cooked all the time and still enjoys it, but she was absolutely not about to spend any more time slaving away in the kitchen than was necessary.  My mom also cooked some stuff that NONE of us liked, but it was either manage to eat enough of it so we weren't starving or go to bed with nothing.  We weren't even given the option to make ourselves a sandwich.\n\nI don't agree with most of the \"old school\" tough parenting techniques, but I'm fully on board with this one.  When I see my one sister making all of her kids different meals and then cooking something else on top of it for her husband, it drives me nuts.  It's a huge waste of her time, and all it's done is teach the kids that they're entitled to exactly what they want all of the time, to the point where there's almost no single meal that we can all eat together and no restaurant we can visit as a family without someone having a total meltdown because today's the day they no longer like x, y, or z.\n\nThis is THE hill to die on.", "NTA, but honestly Y T A for doing it for the last 10+ years in the first place.  I understanding making some accommodations, but there's just a point when it's ridiculous. Not to be rude, but you created the monster, you're going to have to live with the consequences now.", "I grew up in a house with four kids. My mother made one meal. If you didn\u2019t like what was being served, you didn\u2019t have to eat it, but there were no other choices.  My mom wasn\u2019t running a cafeteria if your kids don\u2019t like what\u2019s being cooked you\u2019ve offered them sandwiches they don\u2019t want to cook so sandwiches it is.", "My mom was the one who implemented that in our house too.  The only things I absolutely refused to eat was meatloaf and liver.  I'd make myself a sandwich or go hungry.  \nMy kid is gluten intolerant, so there's a little more leeway with customizing for him but, still, I make food all of us can eat.  \nNTA OP.  You're a mom, not a short order cook", "YTA you've raised them; I mean, they didn't turn out like this by themselves. You're probably one off those mother's that buy their kids things to make them stop fussing in the store. You probably told people \"we never tell the kids 'no' \" . Now that you're sewing what you reaped you need help. No ma'am this is your own reward.", "I grew up in a \u201cyou eat what I make or you go hungry\u201d house. Catering to kids only encourages them to be dicks and complain because that\u2019s behavior you\u2019ve taught them. If your husband has such a problem with it then let him be the chef for the house and make what you like for yourself.", "NTA and you are being too nice.  \n\n\nIn my family, no one was pressured to eat anything they didn't want to, but you went hungry if you turned down a meal. No alternate suggestions, no making a sandwich, no snacks later on.  \n\n\nYou only go to bed hungry about 2 or 3 times, and then you learn to eat what's served. Without complaining, either.", "Unless it's something that makes them puke, they can choose, eat or go hungry. Making something for themselves does not solve the spoiled disrespectful behaviour. Everyone cooking, microwaving, etc. what they fancy ? So your kids are going to live on corndogs and pizza? \nCome on OP, you know better. \nYour husband needs to back you up, not give in to that kind of behaviour towards you. \nIt sounds like you are everyone's doormat. I think it's high time for mama bear to stand up and ROAR.", "YTA - But with a huge caveat. Sure, I can understand not wanting to please everyone's preferences when they are being so picky when it comes to everyday meals. Sometimes you just need to put your foot down. You could even point out that this has been something they have liked in the past. So not the asshole for wanting to simplify normal meal prep.\n\nThe asshole moment comes in when you're punishing them through a meal that is literally made-to-order and easily customizable. Buy your fancy hotdogs (Costco dogs are great!) and burgers. Prepare the normal fixings and set them out for people to make their own. Offer 2 or 3 different cheeses that people can mix and match. If you really want to spice things up, a little chili for the dogs! And if they don't like what is on offer, a plain burger or hotdog is always an option.\n\nThere's no need to take out your frustration on a meal that can easily be made to everyone's specifications.
