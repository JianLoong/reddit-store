I used to follow her until I was 14 when I decided that I would be going my own way because I started seeing a few red flags. She tried to tell me to come back because everyone would miss me but I rejected.\n\nA few months after, the macorona hit and I spent much more time on the internet. That\u2019s when I found out about LGBTQ+ and started questioning my sexuality. I thought long and hard, did a bit of research and came to the conclusion that I\u2019m bisexual. When my mom found out about it, she came into my room to talk with me. She essentially told me that I should focus on getting my school done and get a well-paid job first and brought up the topic of religion again, how she doesn\u2019t want to see me die in armageddon. I broke down infront of her and she left. There were a few attempts to get me back after that but none worked.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, my mom married my stepdad. Suddenly my parents would constantly complain about the smallest things I did wrong, even if I didn\u2019t. They\u2019d constantly make remarks like I\u2019m the reason everyone in the family has to suffer. This went on for months and I started isolating myself much more, only ever coming out to eat or go to the bathroom.\n\nAround that time I met a nice guy on the internet. We started talking, became friends and over a few months I started to see him as my father figure. He treated me like I was his own, spending time with me when I was lonely and comforting me whenever I was feeling down.\n\nAfter a while, my stepdad decided to introduce a new rule: Either be at breakfast before 7am or not have internet for the rest of the day (9am-9pm). I tried to follow the rule as much as I could, but of course had a few slip-ups. My parents were extremely strict with me and enforced the rule even after coming just two or three minutes late. My brother however was a completely different story. He could sleep in for hours multiple days in a row and I parents wouldn\u2019t even budge. This infuriated me since this kind of special treatment had been going on for months.\nI told mom that I find it unfair how he breaks the rules and gets whatever he wants whilst I\u2019m constantly displayed as an outcast. My stepdad overheard and decided to lower only my time from 9am-9pm to 3 hours over the entire day. I was furious. In frustration, I wrote a letter complaining about everything they did to me, how they\u2019re treating me unfairly, how I felt neglected and how a friend from the internet is doing a better job at taking care of me than them. I put the letter on my mom\u2019s bedside table and waited in my room. When she found it, I heard loud crying and everyone in the house was pissed at me.

Your family sounds like a nightmare. They needed a wake up call though I doubt the letter worked.", "Nta but you are also probably being groomed given that your \"friend\" is 20+. Please talk to a trusted adult if you can.", "I think your parents were strict at you for what you are, you said you told your mom you are bisexual and that's when it all began. Also you refuse to follow the religion. It sounds like everything will be fixed if you change these two things. But why would you? It's your right. They can't and should not try to force you. Your parents are bad and I hope they realize it soon before it's too late for them.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI can't judge how much of an asshole your parents are but they definitely are for treating you and your brother differently.\n\nWhat is the major issue though, is your fatherly internet friend. Honestly that is such a huge, huge, huge red flag. That guy is grooming you. You'll now think, how would I know that. I know because I am likely the age that friend is and no person of older age, absolutely no one without ill intent, will become friends with a 15 year old on the internet. Really, you sound emotionally intelligent and smart and mature for your age but you lack the experience of being in your 20's and 30's. So please, please, please end this now. It won't end well.\n\nBeing friends with a 15yo and stepping into some sort of fatherly relationship is very much overstepping boundaries that any older person is aware of. He's doing this on purpose. \n\nThe guy will simply be nice for a while, then slowly overstep any healthy boundaries. He'll tell you how pretty you are, how much he wished he was your age etc. He'll draw you in until you yourself will feel like you are in love with him and that anything inappropriate is your idea.", "NTA.

Your best bet here is probably to find a way to get out of the house and to get therapy ASAP. Any school resources, friends, or non-JW relatives who could help?

Growing up there was a book about parenting that literally had a teenager in a cage as one of the illustrations. You demonstrated deep down there\u2019s a person in there who cares that you like her, no matter how deep they spiral into punishment. It\u2019s a rare moment of self awareness in a cult that\u2019s so brutal towards family relationships \n\nI think you need to be careful and wary, a core principle of JW parenting is the prodigal son, as in you throw the child out, refuse to talk or support them until they come back humbled. The possibility that you\u2019re on the street the day you turn 18 exists. \n\nThe other is \u201cspare the rod, spoil the child\u201d. Their religious culture gives them permission to beat, to punish, to deny basic dignity as a control measure. Keeping your head down, biding your time, getting things you need like a job, money, license, important documents , just basics for life is important. You might win small victories but they don\u2019t see you as sincerely trying to express yourself they see you as a person compromise by Satan, they care about exerting control until you break. I\u2019ve seen it all too frequently if the children don\u2019t comply their entire support system disappears the second they turn 18. Might be important to express yourself but then again it might also be important just to be like water be whatever shape you have to be until you can leave safely. Think about your long-term future your freedom your independence and your stability it is unfortunate how often rainbow kids wind up on the street. So no I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole I just think you have to be strategic about how you go about your life. Stay safe stay careful OK.", "Mom: *does everything in her power to make your life miserable*\n\nAlso Mom: \"damn, why doesn't she love me ??\"\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re right the letter probably didn\u2019t work, i\u2019ve seen it time and time again in that religion if the kids walk away it\u2019s like the parents just turn off their hearts, i\u2019ve never seen a religion where turning off your love like it\u2019s a tap when your children step out of line is so normalized, I am sure there\u2019s others by JW\u2018s amongst the most hardline. It\u2019s shocking to me that the mother actually felt enough to cry. I have no doubt that the controlling stepfather will come up with an even more emotionally brutal punishment because that is the psychology that\u2019s encouraged and ingrained. It\u2019s a rare moment of realness from the mother.", "While that\u2019s very common, it\u2019s not universal.  When I was in high school, I strongly implied but never stated that I was in college (and thus about 4 years older than I really was).  I made friends with people I gamed with, mostly text-based RPGs.  I eventually chose to out myself as my real age, a few years later.  It\u2019s been over 20 years and I\u2019m still friends with one of those guys; others, I was in touch with until AIM ceased to exist in 2017.  They were all very scrupulous about not overstepping boundaries and treated me like a niece or much younger cousin, until I was solidly an adult (in my early 20s), and then they treated me like a peer.", "My friend is in his mid 20s and we\u2019ve known each other for two years now. He\u2019s never asked me for anything weird or sexual and is actively against it because he knows I\u2019m a minor and really just wants to make sure I\u2019m doing well.\nI highly appreciate the concern tho", "Um, no. That's not at all true.\n\nThere are a lot of people out there who will absolutely become close to younger people with absolutely no ill intent. \n\nI mean, have you not heard of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America? Youth mentoring is absolutely a thing, and not everybody who does it is part of a structured group.\n\nThat said, it's still best to avoid engaging in risky behavior as much as possible.", "NTA,   \nI'm not sure if it's because you've rebelled against the religion or challanged their ideology by identifiying as Bi, but there deffinately seems to be a lot of unfair treatment steered towards you. Like some of the others I'm concerned about this 'fatherly friend'. Maybe it's because I'm a court reporter and I hear and write about this so often but a lot of groomers are really good at what they do. Please be careful. I will say beyond that it does get better. I'm sure right now you feel pretty powerless, but things do improve.", "Yep. This is how cults work. They try to wear you down socially and emotionally. NTA.\n\nI have to add obligatory caution with this internet guy. Sometimes predators lure young people in by comforting, validating etc. Just be careful.", "Well, I\u2019ve been in a residential group since around April this year, but not because I requested it but because my parents shoved me into it against my will due to \u201cmedia addiction\u201d and shoving the responsibilities to someone else", "I understand that, I also had internet friends that were older than me but the fatherly figure bit worries me so much.\n\nI have met far too many victims to see the good in people in such cases.", "Honestly, that makes my concerns even worse. Please, be careful, please, I'm begging you.", "The kind of behavior I\u2019d describe as older cousin or uncle type behavior could easily have been described as fatherly.  My dad and I had a lot of conflict in my teens, so these were the people I talked to about my relationships, and got advice from, and when I started exploring religion, it was internet friends I turned to because my parents were on the border between atheist and agnostic and I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get it.  One of them sent me my first books on paganism, because that was his faith and something I was interested in (this was when I\u2019d gone off to college at 16).", "I am, don\u2019t worry. Thanks for the advice", "You seem like a cool person, I hope you can shut out your parents as much as possible until you are on your own feet."]}
