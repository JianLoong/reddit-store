Our dad started dating a year later. He met Sarah when I was 9 and they got married when I was 11. Sarah had a daughter who was 2 when they moved in, which was about a year after they stared dating. Sarah and my dad also had my three half siblings together. So I have 1 stepsister who is now 11 and three half siblings who are 8, 7 and 6. My brothers are 17 and 16. My dad stayed pretty close to my maternal family and they were welcoming to Sarah and my stepsister and half siblings. They were not regular family. But birthdays were remembered and there was a friendliness there. My maternal family saw them as sort of family friends. But Sarah was not their new daughter and my stepsister and half siblings were not considered additional grandchildren. My dad understood this and there were times my brothers and I did stuff with our maternal family without everyone else.\n\nThe problem comes in because dad mentioned to Sarah at some point of their marriage that my grandma had a cookbook that every member of the family had added a recipe to. He added one when he married my mom, mom added one when she was 15. Her siblings added one as kids. My brothers and I all have a recipe in there. Our cousins too. Aunts and uncles related not through blood but through marriage have a recipe in it.\n\nSarah waited to be asked to add a recipe. She also told my stepsister and half siblings that they would get to add a recipe too. When my stepsister said she knew the recipe she wanted to add Sarah decided to ask my grandma when they could add their recipes and my grandma said she never planned to ask them to add recipes and she hoped Sarah would understand it was for their family.\n\nSarah and my dad argued about it. I learned about it via my brothers when I visited for Christmas. They said Sarah and the other kids were upset that it wasn't going to happen and Sarah was saying they were part of the family and it was unfair to exclude them. I was home again for my dad's birthday last week and Sarah was angry that my maternal family were invited to dad's birthday. I told her she was behaving like a child who couldn't let go of something. My stepmom said being excluded from your own family is hurtful. That it was hurtful to children especially. I told her she and her kids were never part of my maternal family, they were welcomed as family friends because of dad and my brothers and me, and she should understand that and never have expected they would be included in the recipe book. Sarah said I was rude and kicked me out of the house. She told me I owe her a big apology.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681289936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jftmc/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_she_was_behaving_like/", "score": 259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see where the shock comes from since the boundaries don't seem to have actually been spelled out to her till now, but they don't have any direct connection to that family.

It's important to empathise for this reason, since they will definitely hurt from a rejection.

The OP\u2019s mother died, and the father eventually met and married Sarah. Would the MFers be happier had he remained single for the rest of his life to honor their late daughter?  If the MFers are going to continue to treat their former son-in-law as part of the family, she should be extended the same courtesy.\n\nSarah sucks for assuming that she could be part of what seems like an inclusive family tradition as well as getting her kids excited about it prematurely.  She also sucks for keeping the fight going with anyone but her husband.\n\nThe OP sucks for the low blows delivered to Sarah during the arguments.  The worst insecurity of a step-parent who truly wants to integrate with their new family is to be treated as \u201cless than\u201d, and the OP worked that angle.\n\nDon\u2019t the holidays always seem to bring the best out of families?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
