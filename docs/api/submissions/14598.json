Our dad started dating a year later. He met Sarah when I was 9 and they got married when I was 11. Sarah had a daughter who was 2 when they moved in, which was about a year after they stared dating. Sarah and my dad also had my three half siblings together. So I have 1 stepsister who is now 11 and three half siblings who are 8, 7 and 6. My brothers are 17 and 16. My dad stayed pretty close to my maternal family and they were welcoming to Sarah and my stepsister and half siblings. They were not regular family. But birthdays were remembered and there was a friendliness there. My maternal family saw them as sort of family friends. But Sarah was not their new daughter and my stepsister and half siblings were not considered additional grandchildren. My dad understood this and there were times my brothers and I did stuff with our maternal family without everyone else.\n\nThe problem comes in because dad mentioned to Sarah at some point of their marriage that my grandma had a cookbook that every member of the family had added a recipe to. He added one when he married my mom, mom added one when she was 15. Her siblings added one as kids. My brothers and I all have a recipe in there. Our cousins too. Aunts and uncles related not through blood but through marriage have a recipe in it.\n\nSarah waited to be asked to add a recipe.

I was home again for my dad's birthday last week and Sarah was angry that my maternal family were invited to dad's birthday. I told her she was behaving like a child who couldn't let go of something. My stepmom said being excluded from your own family is hurtful. That it was hurtful to children especially. I told her she and her kids were never part of my maternal family, they were welcomed as family friends because of dad and my brothers and me, and she should understand that and never have expected they would be included in the recipe book.

We are not talking about lavish gifts at Christmas or a stake in the inheritance - it's a fricking recipe book. Everyone almost certainly knows the family relationships and these are not some friends trying to get in on a tradition.
