The only thing I would even consider in this scenario is moving my apiary to a different spot on my property that's further away from theirs.

Depending on your specific community (and your personal standing/history within it) you might not have the backing of law enforcement or the local government if things escalate. Friends of mine had to deal with homophobic neighbors in rural Maine where they had no support at all, and their differences of opinion on how to deal with it took a huge toll on their relationship. \n\nI don't think your hubby is calling you an AH when he says you could have handled it better, I think he's worried about this escalating. You weren't morally wrong in any way, but it may have been strategically ill-advised. So you should talk about how you both want to deal with this neighbor should it escalate. And it's totally valid if you decide \"making nice\" is damaging to your emotional or mental well-being, but take this at least semi-seriously and figure out how you guys can be a team in dealing with these AHs.", "NTA.
