To avoid aggravating them if possible, keep an eye out for natural hives and avoid ones set up by bee keepers.

I wasn\u2019t sure if it was alive or not, so I picked it up and tried to warm it up in my hands (keeping my hands cupped and warm breath).

It was the cutest, most tickley experience and so cool to see the bee\u2019s lil snoot reaching out and to see the bee go from basically frozen to interacting with the world again.
