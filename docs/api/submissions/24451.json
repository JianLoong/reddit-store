It\u2019s true. You violated his probably only true private space besides his mind.", "YTA like a thousand times over.  Don't you dare.  Don't you dare.  17 years you've been married and he hasn't been talking about this stuff?  DON'T YOU DARE force it on him.\n\nI am not one for marital secrets to this extent, but this is the relationship you've built, this is the trust you've established.  You've already violated it.  Don't you dare stab him in the face with your violation.", "First sentence in, YTA\n\nI'm not sure how you should proceed.  I do not like lying but after thinking about your options,  I think you should carry the burden of your indiscretion alone.  He would likely feel even more intense self loathing paired with feeling violated.  Your husband has nothing to gain from knowing what you know due to reading his diary.  You might feel relieved from not having to lie but this isn't about you.\n\nYou opened Pandora's Box.  Carry the burden.  Also, use that information (NO NEW INFO!!) to intentionally try to encourage him with genuine compliments.  I used to say more negative things about myself.  My partner always replied \"don't talk about my (name) that way!\" in a goofy way and then give me a hug or some other affectionate action.  You know him, come up with something to build him up in those moments.", "YTA, YWBTA.\n\nDon't tell him you broke his trust-that will only relieve your burden and make him feel awful. He may never fully trust you again.  \n\nDO, gently, start trying to pump up his self-confidence. \n\nAlso, realize this may just be his way of getting out his negative emotions so they don't burden him.", "YTA massively so \n\nYou invited yourself to years of his *private* personal thoughts. You were hugely invasive for no reason at all. He didn\u2019t give you any reason to worry about him, or not trust him. You completely disregarded his privacy, and his sovereignty in the relationship, for shits and giggles. You need to do some serious reflection on why the hell you did that OP. \n\nDon\u2019t you dare come at him playing savior after you did all that.", "YWBTA\n\nThis is a huge violation of his privacy and it will deeply upset him to find out that you did it.", "Honestly, yes, YTA and you're in no win situation now \n\nJust know that it will take time for him to trust you again. He won't feel safe leaving personal items in fear of you reading them, and now that he will no longer be able to journal these feelings, he will hold them inside, which may cause his mental health to spiral more", "YTA- its disgusting how you try to validate your complete and utter betrayal of his trust by saying you knew it was wrong. \n\nHow can he ever trust you again? I wouldn't.", "Hands down YTA for not respecting his privacy.", "YTA my journal is where I get those thoughts out so they don\u2019t linger in my head. That\u2019s just depression and it sounds like he has a good coping mechanism. My journal is the epitome of that bridesmaids quote \u201cI thought it was a sad hand written book\u201d. You need to tell him you read it though.", "This is not a question of if you would be the AH, YTA, full stop.  You violated his trust and you need to tell him you read his journal.  Every interaction you have with him from the time you read his journal he is unaware that you have read his private thoughts that we can assume he has intended only for himself.  That is a huge violation of trust and you need to come clean ASAP.", "Unfortunately it\u2019s YTA no matter what, you read something private and you can\u2019t bring it up without hurting him and his trust in you! But your concerns are completely valid. It is a terrible thing to so freely and frequently self loathe: It causes a feedback loop of depression! \n\nThe only way to do this right is to make your husband feel good about himself in the ways that he frequently does not. You have to pretend you never read any of it, but you shouldn\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve learned either. Tricky spot.", "Yes, and for reading them in the first place", "YTA. There is no other answer. You don't get to judge or comment on anything he wrote in HIS journals because you never should have read them. I don't care if you fell asleep and woke up to it opened over your face. You just don't ever read someone's journals. How dare you?", "Yta. The morally correct thing to do would be to confess you have read the journals and see how he responds. What I would do if I were in your situation  is pretend I never read them but give him a bit more assurance and validation every day, like pointing out things he does right and complimenting him more in order to help him feel a bit better about himself.", "YTA but you already know this. \n\nYou have 3 options all of which are shit and you would still BTA in any case. Only one choice in my opinion.\n\n1: you come clean. He will have all of his trust in you evaporated in an instant. Instead of being able to deal with these thoughts in a healthy way he will likely have to keep all of these thoughts of self hate inside his own mind and let them eat away at him until he can trust you again. Depending on how forgiving he is this could be anywhere from couples therapy to divorce to actual self harm. Good Job OP!\n\n2: keep it to yourself but try to improve his self image. He will start to notice a difference in how you act around him and will potentially add paranoia to the list of emotions he feels. \"Why is she acting different?\" \"Is she hiding something from me?\" \"What is she hiding?\" Etc. Causing both of you pain under the guise of trying to help. Even then you will likely eventually tell him because of this and choice 1 happens more extremely.\n\n3: lie and pretend nothing is wrong. Are you a good liar? Can you keep up the act of lying? Well since you're already lying can you stop yourself from continuing to breach is trust? What's one more lie if you already have to deal with this one? Can you handle knowing you are a liar every time he scribbles something down? Clearly this is a huge burden that will also hurt you both and probably lead to choice 1 again with worse consequences \n\nI may have been hyperbolic in describing these choices but this is only to reinforce the gravity of your actions. In your shoes I would tell him that you read his journal and never confront him about his private thoughts. Apologies as much as possible and don't bring up that you are worried about him because you both already know what he wrote. Only after this can you subtly start working on listening to him and becoming the step before writing it in the journal. It's not a game over but you've only got yourself to blame for the whole situation despite wanting to help him.\n\nI do wish you luck OP because you are not a bad person. You have made a HUGE mistake but everyone makes mistakes. You can only rebuild trust with honesty.", "Yta for violating the trust and reading his journal.   Now you have opened a door you can not close.  You will have to confess what you done and allow him the space to talk about it.  If does not then you should not push him to do so.  Tell him you love him and you will listen if he wants to talk. Oh and of course apologize", "Oh no why would you read your husband\u2019s journal?? I get the temptation, but my goodness you\u2019ve rung a bell you can never unring. YTA for the insane breach of privacy.", "YTA for reading his journals. \n\nI\u2019m not sure you should fess up. If he finds out you looked in his journals, he won\u2019t feel safe writing in it anymore. That was a shitty thing to do. I kinda lean toward keeping your mouth shut because of the harm it will do to him. \n\nEither way, don\u2019t do it again.", "YTA. There's a huge distinction between him hiding something from you and having his own private thoughts\u2014you violated what is probably the one and only space where he can freely process these feelings.\n\nYou're going to have to bring this up to him; approach the conversation with genuine contrition and an open mind. He may decide to forgive you immediately, or it may take years for you to regain the same level of trust; regardless of the outcome, you need to take responsibility.", "You 100% need to tell him that you violated his trust. \n\nKeep in mind, a lot of people journal to get rid of intrusive thoughts. It might just be a passing feeling he has, and once he writes it out, it's gone. Or maybe it's what he truly thinks, but you know what? He's allowed to have private thoughts. He's not \"keeping it from you.\" You aren't entitled to his every feeling.", "YTA. Stop invading people privacy like a creep. If you\u2019re willing to invade his privacy like this what else do you do to him when no one\u2019s looking?", "Oh, this is so sad\u2026", "YTA, but nothing good will come from confessing. Live with the guilt! If you really want to boost your husband\u2019s confidence, start or continue to tell him you love him, compliment him, recognize what he does well, build him up.", "dont tell him u read the diary.  but what u can do is hug him and tell him he is the best thing that happened to you and you love him start with that and just some bits of kindness here and there to show he is worthy and more", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you think he'd believe you if you just expressed concern?\n\nIt's pretty clearly an issue that would be good to address - that level of self-loathing is not normal, or healthy.

Your best bet is to carry on like you always have. Don't mention ANYTHING, don't start complimenting more, NOTHING. You have a choice...either come clean, let him know that you betrayed his trust and read his journals w/o asking, apologize and throw yourself on the mercy of HIS Court, or you attempt to NOT do anything that is out of the ordinary and you bluff your way out of this situation.

It doesn\u2019t matter, you violated a trust that you have kept for 17 years and I don\u2019t see a way for you to divulge this without devastating him.  As far as confronting him. No. He is writing this, getting this out, in private, in a journal so he can put it away and do life. He should prob have a therapist if he doesn\u2019t.  The best thing you can do is the next time it comes up organically tell him how much you love him and that you hope he will come to you if he ever has bad feelings about himself that seem overwhelming.", "If OP already felt like they communicated and shared openly enough, there may have been no assumption that what they would read would be as impactful as it was. That is not to say it's excusable.\nBut there are two options, be honest with your partner with what you did, but that seeks to make you feel better and will potentially trigger a more undesired effect from him (rightfully so).\nOr you can choose to never tell him, if you both go through episodes of depression then you will focus on this and be overcome with guilt. There is no real good outcome to this. Personally I'd choose honesty as I don't like the idea of being lied to.

Your comments make it clear you know you f\u2019ed up and won\u2019t do it again. If you are the type of person I think you are this is gonna haunt you for a long time.

If he has been at the same position maybe suggest he asks for or applies to other jobs that would be a promotion for him(most people can get a significant promotion simply by changing jobs and just don\u2019t realize it). If he used to have a hobby he hasn\u2019t done in a long time buy him something that is used in that hobby and suggest he takes it up again. Just find new ways to add joy to his life. \n\nBasically you have to shoulder this burden of knowledge alone while working to improve the situation for him as punishment for violating his privacy. \n\nThere is also the very slight possibility this is nothing to worry about and just a way for him to get all the intrusive thoughts out of his mind so he can be at peace. I know when I screw up I instantly call myself a stupid mfer and cuss myself out. Then I\u2019m over it. Fix the problem and go back to thinking I\u2019m the greatest thing since sliced bread.

I fucked up monumentally, and I don't want to fuck up more, and at the same time I'm so concerned for how he feels about himself. I adore him, and I know I did something horrible, but I want him to adore himself and to feel adored. \n\nIt wasn't bullshit, it really, really wasn't. I just don't know how best to proceed to make him feel the absolute best he can.", "I don't know, I definitely feel like I've been a terrible wife, but I feel like I would be a terrible wife if I didn't use what I learned to help him love himself more too. \n\nThank you for the suggestions, they really mean a lot to me.", "OP, is he currently on therapy? Seeing a psychiatrist? \n\nDid he leave it out in the open? Or just stored/hidden in a different location?\n\nIf you decide to tell him, and I don't know that you should, it would be best to ensure he has support in place first.", "Well you probably feel like a terrible wife because you are a terrible wife.", "1. No, not at the moment. He hasn't been in therapy for about a year and a half, and the last time he saw a psychiatrist was about 4 or 5 years ago.\n2. He left it opened on his desk (in our bedroom and across from my desk). He's never ever left it out like that before, usually his current journal is kept in one of his desk drawers and he keeps his old ones in one of our bookcases. It was extremely odd, and honestly, why I looked in the first place.\n\nThank you for that advice, I really appreciate it.", "Is it possible this was a cry for help? It seems extremely unlikely that he just forgot after all these years and not only left it out, but open. \n\nHe is suffering daily. Whatever you decide to do, please encourage him to see both.", "It might be, I honestly don't know. It was extremely bizarre, he's so meticulous about his routines and writing in his journal is one of them, it was just so strange that he would do that. \n\nI absolutely will. Above all, I want him to love himself. He deserves it more than anyone else I know, and it's horrible that he doesn't seem to have any for himself."]}
