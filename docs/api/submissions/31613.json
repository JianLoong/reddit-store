Still itchy, sniffly and feeling generally unwell, but otherwise okay. He does also chase my cat but she stays upstairs mostly anyway.\n\nWell, a few days ago he discovered our laundry room. He found my underwear, played with it, and my dad got it off him and put it back in the laundry without telling me.

I have obviously tossed the underwear but I'm at a point where I'm so tired of this dog.\n\nI cried to my friend about it and she came to me yesterday evening with her mom and said I could move in with them as long as I pay rent. And I can bring my cat!\n\nSo, this morning, I told my parents they either get rid of the dog or I will move out and they'll have to take care of their own house.\n\nThey started out by apologising, and asking me to reconsider, but when I denied they essentially said I was expecting them to pick between their children. I was a little insulted that I have the same value as a dog they've had for a month and called them bad parents. I'm in pain, I can't enjoy my own home, and they still want to keep the dog.\n\nI went up to bed and told them to make their choice by tomorrow, but I haven't been able to sleep for worry (its 4.30am as of writing). I feel so bad. I spoke to a different friend about it who said it was uncalled for, I should understand. I wouldn't want to give up my cat ever.

If they knew, I think it's a bit inconsiderate of them to just get a dog without talking at least to you about it to find a solution for your allergies. \n\nHowever though, the dog is there now. They made a commitment, and bonded, as you say the dog has become your dad's best friend. And you're asking him to get rid of his best friend now. You can even relate, because you say you would never want to get rid of your cat. So yes, I think that's a bit assholish. \n\nEspecially since you got a solution presented to you already. Your friend says you're welcome there, and so is your cat! Everybody could be happy! So why are you making them choose? Why are YOU not choosing? You can either live rent-free in the house of your parents, but deal with allergies. Or you can move in with your friend, pay rent and be allergy-free. This is not a choice your parents have to make. It's a choice YOU have to make. What is more important to you? \n\nIf you choose to stay with your parents, I suggest having a conversation with them to ensure a situation like that with your underwear won't happen again. You could both do things about this, like you could make sure your clean clothes will be put away immediately where the dog cannot reach it, and your parents could work on teaching the dog to behave a bit better. Perhaps there's a good dog school in the neighbourhood that could help you with that. \n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!", "Putting many things aside, i think you got way too angry, way too quickly.\n\nWhere is a discussion with your parents about what it caused you? (You could show them some of it), asking them to try and help you avoid it from happening? Limiting the dog to the lower floors and you stay in the top floors. You never asked them to try, and they never declined or showed they didn't care.\n\nThere are a lot of things you could've done, you're acting like they don't care but it doesn't sound like you really communicated.\n\nAnd if they aren't open to it, it's fine, they are entitled to having a pet, and you can leave and start your grown up life, no need for an argument.", "Tbh esh. Mostly because your friend's family opened an invitation for you to stay with them provided you pay rent. All you had to say was \"mom, dad, i've decided to move out because.....\" and that would have been the end if it but instead you kind of just told them to choose. Parents get an honorable mention because of the dog getting ahold of your underwear and them not telling you.", "Nta", "NTA but just move out and let them keep their dog, if you make them get rid of it now (which is pretty cruel for the dog, imagine if it was your cat) later on when you move out because you're getting older and need your space it will be very upsetting for them...", "NTA - before even getting the dog they chose it over you and your comfort. That\u2019s before it even became their furkid. So it\u2019s not you making them choose - they have chosen and dislike the consequences of their choice. That\u2019s not your fault.", "Soft YTA.

They love the dog and took on the responsibility of caring for them, it\u2019s not about loving who more, much less for a situation that is not dire, since you CAN move out. Listen, I do think they should have been more considerate of your allergy, like been more thoughtful than letting you wear the contaminated underwear or maybe even keeping the dog in the first place after being gifted them, and you leaving is what they get for that if you choose so to leave, but I also think completely withholding care for your elderly parents because of it is a dick move, (providing they are decent parents), like \u201cget rid of the dog or I won\u2019t care for you\u201d, I\u2019m not saying you are obliged to, you are not their caregiver, but using it as leverage I do think is a twisted power move.

Which I can only take to mean that the ultimatum aimed at your parents is less of a threat of you moving out, and either A) hoping that they'll choose you, or B) your way of trying to get them to listen to you, thinking that they won't hear you out without some kind of stakes.\n\nMy advice; apologise and move out.  \nAt some point you're gonna have to take the leap, whether you're ready for it or not, and you know (since you feel awful about it) that if they got rid of the dog that none of you would be happy, since they clearly wanna keep the dog and that'd only make you feel worse.  \nThe only way all four of you will be happy, is if the dog stays with your parents, and you move somewhere that's dog free.", "YTA\n\nIt sucks they didn't consider you when they got the dog, but it kinda sounds like they've been waiting for you get out of the house before the can get a dog, and you didn't go when they expected (18).\n\nIf you are going to go, then just go. It is not \"choosing a dog over you,\" they already took care of you for 19 years and probably expected you would be largely out of the house at this age. I don't think it would be horrible for them to choose the experience of having a dog for themselves and you living elsewhere (normal for parents and adult children) over housing their adult child for free.

My parents are older and while I live here I essentially take care of the upper floors of the house instead of paying rent. \n\nAbout a month ago my parents got a dog from a friend.

Still itchy, sniffly and feeling generally unwell, but otherwise okay. He does also chase my cat but she stays upstairs mostly anyway.\n\nWell, a few days ago he discovered our laundry room. He found my underwear, played with it, and my dad got it off him and put it back in the laundry without telling me. As you can imagine, when I put it on yesterday, there was a whole situation down there.\n\nIt's itchy, sore & bleeding in some spots. I have obviously tossed the underwear but I'm at a point where I'm so tired of this dog.\n\nI cried to my friend about it and she came to me yesterday evening with her mom and said I could move in with them as long as I pay rent. And I can bring my cat!\n\nSo, this morning, I told my parents they either get rid of the dog or I will move out and they'll have to take care of their own house.\n\nThey started out by apologising, and asking me to reconsider, but when I denied they essentially said I was expecting them to pick between their children.

I feel so bad. I spoke to a different friend about it who said it was uncalled for, I should understand. I wouldn't want to give up my cat ever.

Allergy source... on one's nethers.    I'll give dad a \"didn't think about it at the time\" pass because between general human moments of not thinking something through and the addition that males often don't really understand or think about the life of owning and caring for a vulva (even if married and very much aware of such things from a life with their wife or a long life best buddy or something)......  still.   Between the above paragraph and that, even though not a malicious act they need to know, really know and follow up with, the utmost they can in avoiding unnecessary you-and-dog contact.  Crotch item or not, \"dog has been all over this item, maybe she shouldn't put it on\" is a pretty basic thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)  They love you and they love their dog, you have somewhere else you can go and be allergy free that at least doesn't \\*sound\\* like you're going to be somewhere you can't visit...  so it's a great alignment.  They should be on board as it solves the problem!

You're an adult, just move out if you're not happy in your parents' house? They literally didn't have dependents to consider when they decided to get a dog, and just like you they're not going to get rid of their pet, that's unrealistic. \n\nDo you recognise that being asked to pay no rent and just clean only half the house is an incredibly sweet deal? If so, maybe be a bit more reasonable with your requests to get it back to the great situation you had until recently e.g. 'please can we all be really careful about closing the door to the laundry room'.", "YTA because you\u2019re giving an ultimatum. That\u2019s childish. Just move out.

You\u2019re literally saying the exact same thing about your cat as they are about you and their dog. \n\nNow do you see where the problem lies? You love your cat as much as they love their dog. Only having the dog a short while means nothing. I loved my dog as much after 2 weeks as I love him now after 2 years. Additionally, you are an adult. They have no obligation to provide shelter for you, and you have no right to act like this when they are doing you a massive favor by allowing you to live there for free (doing sparce chores in exchange is hardly equivalent to rent, since you mentioned they hardly use the space). So you have a few options here:\n\n1. Do your own laundry from now on, and be more mindful to keep the dog away from your space and clothes. Don\u2019t have clothes in the dryer when you\u2019re at work. Also, mark your dryer clearly with a sticker or taped-on index card so the mistake will not be made again by either parent. Before this, though, apologize profusely for acting this way and hope your parents forgive you and allow you to stay in the first place. \n\n2. Suck it up and get roommates even though you don\u2019t want to because being an adult means doing things you don\u2019t want to do sometimes.\n\n3.

But sure, lets call it 'detrimental to her health'.\n\nAlso, OP stated they have a valid option for moving out so why even bring up the whole 'its not easy to move  out at 19'?", "The go. And realize this will be a roommate situation and could ruin a friendship. You will realize some cleaning in exchange for rent was a sweet deal when you have to pitch in with chores AND rent. Because when you live alone or with roommates or a significant other that's how it works. You do both. So if you want to move, move. Sounds like you are wanting them to choose in some sort of sick way. Just move if you want to do badly and can afford it, hope so with all that money you saved up by not paying rent.", "They are saying stay if you want , but I do believe there may be a ulterior motive. I would just move out either way soon, since they don\u2019t respect your issues", "They aren't severely allergic. Being sniffly and itchy is not \"severely\" allergic. I had a housemate move in knowing they were that level of allergic to cats, and they just took medication and vacuumed in the areas they needed to sit in. The whole thing about putting on underwear that the dog touched and then bleeding and getting sores from, is incredibly weird if true, but not something the parents did on purpose.", "Look up the warnings and side effects for the allergy meds. The meds have to change your reactions to the allergen at the cellular level. \n\nBecause the patient is always under the influence, they simply adjust to the new normal. \n\nI've been there, and the difference in quality of life after leaving the allergens behind is dramatic. You don't realize how your breathing was compromised until it's not.  Taking a deep breath is heavenly.\n\nOne of the things your body instinctively does when in the presence of airborne allergens is to restrict breathing.  The body naturally shifts to shallower breathing. You won't notice it until you remove the allergens from your exposure.", "That shouldn\u2019t be a question asked to a 19yo. Parents of a 19yo rather have to take care of the teenager than vise versa.", "Yeah. I mean the house would probably be dirty but they wouldn't like die or anything.", "It's not the same she's allergic lol", "His parents aren't fucking allergic to his cat. They've had the dog for all of a month. He takes care of a significant part of the house in lieu of rent. I hardly call that not paying his way. They'll spend more on household help than he would have paid in rent.", "wanting your parents to deal with something that's causing you literal bodily harm makes a person entitled now?", "Well this dog mom wasn\u2019t able to have real children so yes I treat my dog very well. She is family to me. I don\u2019t buy her any clothes because I think clothes on animals is dumb. Plus animals love us unconditionally and I would take an animal over most humans now a days anyway", "I have a feeling these people view pets as objects. Anyone who has lost a beloved pet to something preventable (or even just manageable) because they couldn't afford specialized care would know what a horrible, all consuming hopeless feeling that is.\n\nWho cares if my cats cat food is $35/4lbs? He needs it and I'm not losing him.\n\nLike, I legitimately doubt I would survive losing another pet this year- I already lost my geriatric cat and my remaining cat's brother. I can't handle another pet. I think I'd have a total mental breakdown.", "It doesn't necessarily bother me, but the idea that someone would disregard their own health in respect of making sure their pets are living a life of luxury is completely ridiculous.\n\nIf you can afford it the go ahead and do so, but don't risk your own health by living off scraps and leftovers", "I promise they didn't want the dog. My dad hated dogs two months ago. He was only supposed to watch the dog for the night but then his friends asked if he could stay for a week and here we are lol. They just signed over ownership and now he's here to stay.", "I have wanted to move out. They asked me not to because I keep the house clean. If they wanted me out why are they asking me to stay?", "You never met a lazy person before?", "Believe it or not, but not everyone has a dryer. Sometimes you have to hang up your washed clothes so they dry.", "Plenty of people forget to take laundry out for some hours, as long as it's forgotten in the dryer and not the washing machine, that's not a big problem.", "More of a last ditch \"save the marriage baby\" that still ended in divorce. He has nephews the same age as him. \n\nI have an uncle who is the same age as my brother also, which is weird but my mum had my brother young (18) and her mum had my uncle later (44 I think, second marriage family).\n\nIt's just not as uncommon here I guess \ud83e\udd37", "My dad was 45 when I was born. He and my mom had 3 kids together already. I was the only planned one.", "As the child to older parents this comments bugs me still to this day lol just because someone\u2019s older doesn\u2019t mean the baby wasn\u2019t planed. Just means the parents were selfish.", "And why are there 'a lot' of chores (400$ cleaning service's worth weekly) on the upper two floors if only one person and a cat ever go up there ('my parents won't go up there')?", "Stop grilling OP. Get something to eat or take a nap, you are unnecesserily cruel and judgy at this point.", "Ok so swap \u201clate-ish adoption\u201d for \u201csurprise success\u201d.", "As someone with intense hayfever, I really woudln't want to feel like that every single day of the year if there was an easy way out. It's just a runny nose, it's just sneezing a million times a day, it's just my eyes tearing up and feeling itchy all day and my throat itching non-stop. It is all mangeable and the symptoms can be somewhat reduced by medication but those also come with side effects of their own. Her parents got the dog on a whim by the sounds of it, they could and should have put more thought into it. There is no way they didn't know about these allergies. No child reaches the age of 19 without spending some time close to a dog.", "That\u2019s true in a perfect world. However, some people have kids later in life and by the time their kid is 19 there\u2019s a chance they won\u2019t be healthy enough to live independently. So age can definitely play a role in my thinking!", "I was a little torn at first just because I get being really attached to an animal. However, these are your parents and when they took in the dog they had to know you were allergic! They went ahead knowing it would make you feel, at best, a bit yucky and, at worst, it would make you feel like complete shit! \nYou are not required to set yourself on fire to keep your parents warm! So moving out because of the dog isn\u2019t an asshole move! I don\u2019t think you should have given them an ultimatum tho. It may have been better if you had just told them that you **needed** to move out because your health was being affected too much by the dog! You are definitely NTA for wanting to like somewhere you don\u2019t feel ill!", "Get them a cleaner and move out. I was on the fence until you said about the children comment. Wtf.", "Also, who came up with this stupid rule that you have to pay rent at 18 to your own parents?! So American.", ">His parents aren't fucking allergic to his cat. They've had the dog for all of a month. He takes care of a significant part of the house in lieu of rent. I hardly call that not paying his way. They'll spend more on household help than he would have paid in rent.\n\nIf this teen is allergic to the dog to the level they claim, they are most likely allergic to that cat, too. The proteins that cause the allergic reaction are very similar, and most people who are allergic to cats or dogs are allergic to all furry friends. \n\nAs for paying more for household help than they'd collect in rent? probably not. Let's say they get a cleaner in, you're looking at about $120 - $200 a visit. Most people use such services every two weeks. Rent would be more in 99% of places.", "These people have a child and they are choosing the dog they had for a month over their literal kid. This is not situation that should be compromised about when the dog is clearly causing harm to their kid for just existing. And who in their right mind wouldn't rewash clothes that the dog used to chew on and play with? Especially when you know the other person is allergic.", "I can see it both ways tbh. I get not wanting to sacrifice your needs over a pet's, but buying cheaper food doesn't necessarily mean you're risking your health. A lot of people shop at Aldi and in clearance sections when they can easily afford more, just cause it's cheaper.\n\nAlso, personally, if I had to choose between letting myself not eat as much or my cat? I'd choose myself every time. She doesn't understand what's going on, and I made a commitment to taking care of her when I adopted her. I won't ever let her go hungry, she matters too much to me.", "This doesn't change the rest of what I said. You are thinking about this as you vs the dog in their hearts but that's not what it is. It's this -\n\nOwning a dog that will bring them joy for years as they age and become empty nesters + their adult child moves out (to a safe place, not too far, where you get to keep your cat) at an age that is fairly standard for adult children to live separately. \n\n\nVS\n\nGiving up a dog that they recently fell in love with and has improved their lives + their adult child continues living in their home for free.\n\nThis is why I think the whole ultimatum and \"oh no, they love a dog more than their kid\" thing is guilt trippy and not true.", "Wow you are dense. Also, that's a very sweet deal cleaning up a house for no rent. You'll miss that once you move out. Hope you saved up. Even living with friends life's about to hit you fast. Also, friend is a roommate and that can ruin a friendship so...be careful. Welcome to the real world. Everything costs money and you will not have enough for everything. Try not to alienate your parents to much. You will regret it later...", "I don\u2019t know, maybe you should ask them. Instead of, you know, random strangers on the Internet. The fact remains you are a legal adult and able to make your own decisions. As are your parents. Their world has revolved around you for the last 20 years, maybe a dog is good for them. Just like getting out and experiencing life would be good for you.", "I'm actually shocked that this isn't a norm.\nPeople fold and put away the clean laundry before they run out of clothes to wear?", "Or someone with ADHD", "Lots of them. I am a lazy person myself. \nMy clean laundry quite often makes it to the bedroom and sits in a basket in the corner of the room for a few days before I put it away.\nWhat it doesn't do is sit in the laundry room.

You really need to avoid the drama if you can. It's really simple, the dog is making you ill and they are refusing to get rid of it.
