Nothing serious just very irritating. My parents are older and while I live here I essentially take care of the upper floors of the house instead of paying rent. \n\nAbout a month ago my parents got a dog from a friend. He's a little dog, not sure what breed, and generally an okay dog. My dad's best friend. \n\nUp until now it's been rough but okay. I take allergy meds and that mostly helps. Still itchy, sniffly and feeling generally unwell, but otherwise okay. He does also chase my cat but she stays upstairs mostly anyway.\n\nWell, a few days ago he discovered our laundry room. He found my underwear, played with it, and my dad got it off him and put it back in the laundry without telling me. As you can imagine, when I put it on yesterday, there was a whole situation down there.\n\nIt's itchy, sore & bleeding in some spots. I have obviously tossed the underwear but I'm at a point where I'm so tired of this dog.\n\nI cried to my friend about it and she came to me yesterday evening with her mom and said I could move in with them as long as I pay rent. And I can bring my cat!\n\nSo, this morning, I told my parents they either get rid of the dog or I will move out and they'll have to take care of their own house.\n\nThey started out by apologising, and asking me to reconsider, but when I denied they essentially said I was expecting them to pick between their children. I was a little insulted that I have the same value as a dog they've had for a month and called them bad parents. I'm in pain, I can't enjoy my own home, and they still want to keep the dog.\n\nI went up to bed and told them to make their choice by tomorrow, but I haven't been able to sleep for worry (its 4.30am as of writing). I feel so bad. I spoke to a different friend about it who said it was uncalled for, I should understand. I wouldn't want to give up my cat ever. I'd die for her.\n\nI can't keep living like this but I also feel awful making them choose. Either way it sucks for someone. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700818061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/182odeq/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_either_get_rid/", "score": 1301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they knew, I think it's a bit inconsiderate of them to just get a dog without talking at least to you about it to find a solution for your allergies. \n\nHowever though, the dog is there now. They made a commitment, and bonded, as you say the dog has become your dad's best friend. And you're asking him to get rid of his best friend now. You can even relate, because you say you would never want to get rid of your cat. So yes, I think that's a bit assholish. \n\nEspecially since you got a solution presented to you already. Your friend says you're welcome there, and so is your cat! Everybody could be happy! So why are you making them choose? Why are YOU not choosing? You can either live rent-free in the house of your parents, but deal with allergies. Or you can move in with your friend, pay rent and be allergy-free. This is not a choice your parents have to make. It's a choice YOU have to make. What is more important to you? \n\nIf you choose to stay with your parents, I suggest having a conversation with them to ensure a situation like that with your underwear won't happen again. You could both do things about this, like you could make sure your clean clothes will be put away immediately where the dog cannot reach it, and your parents could work on teaching the dog to behave a bit better. Perhaps there's a good dog school in the neighbourhood that could help you with that. \n\nHope this helps. Best of luck!", "Putting many things aside, i think you got way too angry, way too quickly.\n\nWhere is a discussion with your parents about what it caused you? (You could show them some of it), asking them to try and help you avoid it from happening? Limiting the dog to the lower floors and you stay in the top floors. You never asked them to try, and they never declined or showed they didn't care.\n\nThere are a lot of things you could've done, you're acting like they don't care but it doesn't sound like you really communicated.\n\nAnd if they aren't open to it, it's fine, they are entitled to having a pet, and you can leave and start your grown up life, no need for an argument.", "Tbh esh. Mostly because your friend's family opened an invitation for you to stay with them provided you pay rent. All you had to say was \"mom, dad, i've decided to move out because.....\" and that would have been the end if it but instead you kind of just told them to choose. Parents get an honorable mention because of the dog getting ahold of your underwear and them not telling you.", "Nta", "NTA but just move out and let them keep their dog, if you make them get rid of it now (which is pretty cruel for the dog, imagine if it was your cat) later on when you move out because you're getting older and need your space it will be very upsetting for them...", "NTA - before even getting the dog they chose it over you and your comfort.

They love the dog and took on the responsibility of caring for them, it\u2019s not about loving who more, much less for a situation that is not dire, since you CAN move out. Listen, I do think they should have been more considerate of your allergy, like been more thoughtful than letting you wear the contaminated underwear or maybe even keeping the dog in the first place after being gifted them, and you leaving is what they get for that if you choose so to leave, but I also think completely withholding care for your elderly parents because of it is a dick move, (providing they are decent parents), like \u201cget rid of the dog or I won\u2019t care for you\u201d, I\u2019m not saying you are obliged to, you are not their caregiver, but using it as leverage I do think is a twisted power move.

Taking the medication everyday is unacceptable for your health. Please discuss it again to them, but less as a threat and more an explanation. It is too dangerous/unhealthy for you to live in the same house as a dog you are allergic to. \n\nIf they do not want to give up the dog you will have to move out.

I (19) am allergic to dogs. Nothing serious just very irritating. My parents are older and while I live here I essentially take care of the upper floors of the house instead of paying rent. \n\nAbout a month ago my parents got a dog from a friend. He's a little dog, not sure what breed, and generally an okay dog. My dad's best friend. \n\nUp until now it's been rough but okay. I take allergy meds and that mostly helps. Still itchy, sniffly and feeling generally unwell, but otherwise okay. He does also chase my cat but she stays upstairs mostly anyway.\n\nWell, a few days ago he discovered our laundry room. He found my underwear, played with it, and my dad got it off him and put it back in the laundry without telling me. As you can imagine, when I put it on yesterday, there was a whole situation down there.\n\nIt's itchy, sore & bleeding in some spots. I have obviously tossed the underwear but I'm at a point where I'm so tired of this dog.\n\nI cried to my friend about it and she came to me yesterday evening with her mom and said I could move in with them as long as I pay rent. And I can bring my cat!\n\nSo, this morning, I told my parents they either get rid of the dog or I will move out and they'll have to take care of their own house.\n\nThey started out by apologising, and asking me to reconsider, but when I denied they essentially said I was expecting them to pick between their children. I was a little insulted that I have the same value as a dog they've had for a month and called them bad parents. I'm in pain, I can't enjoy my own home, and they still want to keep the dog.\n\nI went up to bed and told them to make their choice by tomorrow, but I haven't been able to sleep for worry (its 4.30am as of writing). I feel so bad. I spoke to a different friend about it who said it was uncalled for, I should understand. I wouldn't want to give up my cat ever. I'd die for her.\n\nI can't keep living like this but I also feel awful making them choose. Either way it sucks for someone. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Did you bother communicating with your parents at all before the ultimatum? It would have been very easy to bring up the topic of the severity of your allergies, and the possibility of moving out if the situation didn't improve.\n\nIt sucks that they compared their love for you to their love for a dog they've barely had a month, but it can be hard to give up a pet once you've bonded with them.\n\nI also don't get how the dog got into clean laundry or why you had to throw the underwear out instead of washing it.", "YTA, it's their house, you're living there rent-free as an adult and \"taking care of the upper floors\" sounds like you're just doing a bit housework, which is the bare minimum.\nThey want a dog in their house.

If they knew about your allergy before they (recently) got the dog, that's a horrifically shitty move on their part to not even discuss it with you before making that decision. If not, or if they assumed it wasn't that bad and you'd deal OK, then maybe fair enough, but I'd question how you can have a kid for 19 years with that severe an allergy and be so disinterested you never realised.\n\nYou came with a perfectly fair solution: it's their house, not yours, so you can't demand they get rid of the dog, but you can (and should!) move out. On top of that, you offered them the option to prevent that happening, with no obligation to do it, but choice is there.\n\nYou've been reasonable in the face of dangerously selfish stupidity. They now need to deal with the consequences of their dangerously selfish action, oh well, sucks for them.\n\nETA: regarding your \"I'm putting them in a really tight spot\", no, you are not, they are. *They* chose to get a dog when a resident was highly allergic, *they* chose to not take action to minimise the impact of this on you...this is a \"their actions have consequences for them\" thing, you're not doing anything to them.", "You\u2019re an adult.

I'm sorry what?

And unnecessary.  The comparison wasn't needed to be made to hold the point that they want to keep their dog \\*and\\* you in the. house when you told them it was one of you going.  \n\n\nBut that's not why I think it wasn't an AH statement.  Wanting to keep you both in the house, lovely in theory/desire.  The children comparison, unnecessary and foolish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat puts it over the line into correct to me is not about keeping the dog...   \n\n\n...it's because they don't seem particularly concerned with your welfare regarding it.  \n\n\n1). They know you live there and are allergic, but they got it anyways.    \n\n\n2) They aren't just not doing as much as they could to be at least helpful in battling the allergy issues, they're doing thoughtless things like the underwear.  \n\n\nAllergies or not, unless the owner of the undies is fine with the dog having been playing with them and you putting them back into their clean clothes and that is established (I can't see where this would all align, but for sake of argument...) you don't do that.    \n\n\n Knowing the undies owner is having strong allergy issues over said dog you Very Much don't do that.   Allergy source... on one's nethers.    I'll give dad a \"didn't think about it at the time\" pass because between general human moments of not thinking something through and the addition that males often don't really understand or think about the life of owning and caring for a vulva (even if married and very much aware of such things from a life with their wife or a long life best buddy or something)......  still.   Between the above paragraph and that, even though not a malicious act they need to know, really know and follow up with, the utmost they can in avoiding unnecessary you-and-dog contact.  Crotch item or not, \"dog has been all over this item, maybe she shouldn't put it on\" is a pretty basic thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)  They love you and they love their dog, you have somewhere else you can go and be allergy free that at least doesn't \\*sound\\* like you're going to be somewhere you can't visit...  so it's a great alignment.  They should be on board as it solves the problem!  They get to keep their dog, they get to have their kid not allergy ridden every day... and living in fear of the next dog-crotch incident (dark humor there.... so sorry, by the way, to hear about that course of events and its results... ugh)  \n\n\nSo, yeah while not bad parents as in malicious they aren't using basic sense, courtesy, and embracing a great compromise for you all.  Instead they turned to defending/being dramatic in a silly way over you having another option.  (I can appreciate that a bit as it sounds you made a dramatic ultimatum and it may've been kneejerk-dumb sort of thing rather than \"I have a solution!\", but in any case, there is a solution)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't apologize for the bad parenting comment, but if it's needed I would clarify that that they aren't being mean they're being thoughtless/not-mindful.  \n\n\nAnd carry on with the moving out because, again, that works for everyone from how you describe it!  \n\n\nYou're NTA.  But do clarify if misunderstood that they aren't being accused of being malicious but rather that given your situation (in general and currently due to undies) they aren't being proportionately concerned and careful in bringing the new dog into the house and now doing their best at alleviating the allergic reactions your dealing with.  \n\n\nThen tell that you understand they love their dog and love you but the flat facts are that you and the dog can't be sharing the house... and there is in fact a good solution that you're taking.", "Wtf why did they bring a dog in if your allergic? What parents would do that? This is insane. If the dog has same value as you id just fucking pack up and leave", "I don't understand why you framed this as an ultimatum. You're an adult, just move out if you're not happy in your parents' house? They literally didn't have dependents to consider when they decided to get a dog, and just like you they're not going to get rid of their pet, that's unrealistic. \n\nDo you recognise that being asked to pay no rent and just clean only half the house is an incredibly sweet deal? If so, maybe be a bit more reasonable with your requests to get it back to the great situation you had until recently e.g. 'please can we all be really careful about closing the door to the laundry room'.", "YTA because you\u2019re giving an ultimatum. That\u2019s childish. Just move out. Additionally, if you would die for your cat, which is extreme (but I understand deeply loving a pet), then you should understand your parents comparing choosing between you and the dog as choosing between children, as most parents would die for their children. You\u2019re literally saying the exact same thing about your cat as they are about you and their dog. \n\nNow do you see where the problem lies? You love your cat as much as they love their dog. Only having the dog a short while means nothing. I loved my dog as much after 2 weeks as I love him now after 2 years. Additionally, you are an adult. They have no obligation to provide shelter for you, and you have no right to act like this when they are doing you a massive favor by allowing you to live there for free (doing sparse chores in exchange is hardly equivalent to rent, since you mentioned they hardly use the space). So you have a few options here:\n\n1. Do your own laundry from now on, and be more mindful to keep the dog away from your space and clothes. Don\u2019t have clothes in the dryer when you\u2019re at work. Also, mark your dryer clearly with a sticker or taped-on index card so the mistake will not be made again by either parent. Before this, though, apologize profusely for acting this way and hope your parents forgive you and allow you to stay in the first place. \n\n2. Suck it up and get roommates even though you don\u2019t want to because being an adult means doing things you don\u2019t want to do sometimes.\n\n3. Move into your friend\u2019s house and hope they don\u2019t change their minds about your cat. While you\u2019re there, work on self-reflection: \u201crules for thee but not for me\u201d is not a good way to live, and you need to understand why your reaction shocked and hurt your parents.\n\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.\n\nWho are those redditors who think that once you hit 18 you should be out of your parent's home ?!\n\nMaybe it's a cultural thing but it seems insane to me.", "NTA.

I would've just moved out stating that an opportunity came up, you want to explore, and it's an added bonus that you don't have to worry about your dog allergy anymore.

You can:\n\n\u2022 forgive the incident and continue to live with them, but run the risk of encountering more issues about the dog\n\n\u2022 force them to give up the dog, in which case you run the risk of them resenting you for it\n\n\u2022 move out and get the space to breathe, possibly making your relationship better but also risking growing apart from them and losing connection\n\nI hope you don't blame the dog, OP.

And never make the ultimate \u201cme or the dog\u201d, the dog almost always wins.", "**TL;DR:** No one's at fault that the situation isn't working out well, but you're all at fault for apparently not communicating. OP is additionally at fault for escalating the conflict in a manipulative way instead of finding a solution/compromise.\n\n**Info:** what, if anything, did you all discuss before they got the dog and in the time they got the dog until now?\n\nSo far, **ESA/soft YTA** for me, but we're lacking info so I'm going off of different assumptions.\n\nI see **2 issues here, the first is communication**:\n\nLiving with a pet when you have a pet allergy is shitty and imo it's irresponsible to bring a pet into a household with an existing pet without a plan. If they sprung that on you out of nowhere, that's inconsiderate even if it's their house. It's also not cool of them to compare you to the dog. You were already upset, it made you feel like they didn't value you. It's still not the best response to call them bad parents.\n\nOn the other hand, a new pet doing 'bad' things when adjusting to a new home can't be totally prevented. Also, if you didn't know how badly the allergy would affect you or previously insisted that it was fine, that sucks but they couldn't have known (if not, see above).\n\nImmediately jumping to an ultimatum is bad communication, in my opinion. Everyone should have planned for the situation, checked in with each other, and looked for a solution together.\n\nNow you escalated a conflict, tried to pressure them into something they don't want to do, gave all of that a short timeline *and* pulled in outsiders (my parents would be humiliated), seemingly before you gave them the opportunity to figure it out together. I understand that emotions run high when you feel terrible and you're still a teen, so *soft* YTA. I understand you, I still think it's AH-ish behavior.\n\nThe **second is your insistence on** ***your*** **preferred solution:**\n\nWhen you adopt an animal and give it back, that's possibly traumatizing for the animal, so I would try other options first before giving it back. It's also not always easy to give an animal back logistically (e.g. adopting it from someone who can't keep the dog) and emotionally. You have to respect their attachment within reason, even if you don't share it. If they're dead set on having a dog in general, you have to accept that choice.\n\nAlso, there seems to be no need for an urgent ultimatum. If they don't expect you to keep living with them, moving out is a reasonable solution and you have an offer already so it's feasible. You could also try to modify your living situation together. My brother is terribly allergic to cats and lives with cats. It's hard, not something I'd expect someone to do unless they really wanted to, but something that may be managed together if everyone is very insistent on living together.", "EHS. Sounds like there was no previous conversation on managing the dog and allergies. Maybe they would have been willing to pay for a doctor appointment to see about allergy shots? Or keep the dog downstairs? The underwear seems like it was breaking the camels back, but it's unclear what happened before for this to be such a big issue rather than \"hey, please make sure  the dog doesn't get into my stuff - remember I'll get blisters.\"\n\nI do think they were assholes for framing it as choosing between children, but they're about to be empty nesters and it makes sense your dad is probably really attached to that dog. You're now autonomous and independent whereas they do need to care for the dog.\n\nAs others have said, you should have chose to move out and explain why. 19 is a pretty normal age to move out and and this point your parents were doing you a favour letting you stay, though it was mutual since they benefit from your cleaning.\n\nNext time see if a compromise is possible first or just move out and explain while you love them your allergies don't make it possible. Now you've turned it into a \"do they love the dog or you more\" which is just an untrue framing of the situation. Obviously they love you more, but you're independent and the dog isn't.", "YTA for the ultimatum. There are other solutions to keep the dog away from you. Why not buy a baby gate to keep the dog contained to the downstairs area? There are too many dogs that end up in shelters and/or euthanized because people refuse to think for half a second to come up with a solution. This is their house...not yours.

Implying that a dog you know for a month is of equal, if not greater value, than your 19 year old child is a vile thing. In this day and age teenagers are often unable to provide for themselves. Everything is more expensive than 40-50 years ago and comparatively you make less money. Couple that with an entry level job or even just a part-time entry level job (they could still be in school or go to college) and that means, that it\u2019s near impossible to provide for yourself. So many people assume, that your responsibility towards your child just magically end, when they turn 18. They\u2018re still in school, have no life skills and in America they can\u2019t even buy a Whiskey to make this shithole more bearable but people expect them to be fully independent all of a sudden? Some countries have actual laws against this. In my country, you couldn\u2019t just endanger your child\u2018s health or kick them out just because they\u2018re 18. That\u2018s still illegal because at least my government has recognized the ridiculousness of giving up all responsibility at 18. You\u2019re officially allowed to tell your child to go fuck themselves, when they turn 25, which gives even the slower ones enough time, to build a life for themselves without having to legally cater to their parent\u2018s every whim, in order to not become homeless. Same thing with expecting rent from your child, as if they owed you something. You birthed them, that\u2019s something they can\u2019t possibly consent to, so you owe them, not the other way around. Again, in my country things like this are practically unheard of and people would immediately label you as a bad parent. Oh, you have to rely on your child for financial stability?

I haven\u2019t even mentioned, that spaces you rent out for money have to fulfill certain standards, even in the U.S. and renting out your child\u2018s room to them does not fulfill these standards, so in most cases, it\u2019s illegal on top of that. And then people wonder why their children won\u2019t talk to them anymore or send them into the cheapest nursing homes possible. These are the implications here, can you see that? It\u2019s about more than the parents being able to own a dog in their own home. Situations like these are never that simple, there are a lot of factors and possibilities one has to consider and \u201ewhose house is it\u201c doesn\u2019t even begin to accurately depict the situation in the slightest. Judging from the parent\u2019s reaction, OP is providing valuable work for them by keeping half of the house clean and up to standards and their payment for that it bleeding in the crotch. OP said in a comment that now, that she\u2018s gone, the house will probably become very dirty, so it seems like her parents are unable to clean up after themselves for whatever reason. So I think it was very courteous of OP to give them a choice. Either get rid of the dog or live in filth. This is a co-dependent housing situation. OP needs a place to stay and the parents need a cleaning lady. \u201eWhose house is it\u201c just became even more inaccurate. Parents just traded their 19 year old child, a clean living space and with that a lot of comfort and quality of life for a dog, they had for a month.

I mean the parents own the house, but in my country the parents are required to take care of the kid untill they are 21, so the kid is allowed to live there untill then.

I find it weird that a dad who is so meticulous he pays $400/week to deep clean several unused rooms in his house would think it\u2019s fine to throw dog-chewed undies back in with the clean laundry. Regardless, that expectation should be communicated to the parents going forward. \n\nAs to the allergies, from the perspective of someone with severe pet allergies. They put me in the hospital a lot as a kid. As an adult, I\u2019ve lived in households with pets in roommate situations. I couldn\u2019t afford to live on my own at the time, and I\u2019d never dream of asking someone to give up their pet when I am choosing to live with them. So I got allergy shots, took daily allergy medicine, established boundaries for spaces in the home the pets were allowed to enter, used baby gates, washed laundry separately, even wore N95 masks at certain times when I had to be in common spaces, and got really good quality air filters.\n\nOP didn\u2019t try any of that other than taking OTC allergy medicine (which, if their allergies are so severe, probably isn\u2019t enough to get them under control anyway). They have 2 whole floors to themselves. They have an entire washer and drier for their personal use. It would be so, so easy in that environment to reduce cross contamination with allergens compared to most living situations. \n\nOP needs to grow up and take responsibility for their health, not give their parents ultimatums. Either OP willing to live in an environment with some allergen exposure, or they\u2019re not. That\u2019s their choice alone as an adult. Although the parents haven\u2019t had the dog long, I am not surprised they have an emotionally significant bond with the dog as aging almost-empty nesters. I think it\u2019s wrong to ask the parents to get rid of the dog.

Hope it gets better soon.", "OP said they are adopted, I wonder if that has something to do with it, which would suck.", "But... thats what OP said?  \nOP said they're going to move out if parents are keeping the dog cause it makes them majorly uncomfortable and it's extremely unhealthy for them, as was proven by the incident.\n\nHow is it OPs fault that they're *communicating properly???*\n\nShould OP just disappear one day up and vanish and never talk to them again or what. Ops phrasing wasn't great sure, but it comes down to OP or the dog. Maybe the parents wanted OP to stay, as is evidence by them apologizing and asking for OP to stay, so giving parents the conditions for OP to stay makes sense. Then they announced they did not agree with OPs condition, so OPs leaving. \n\nBoth sides showed heightened emotions and approached the conversation with an intensity that wasn't conducive to proper communication, but really OP couldn't have said much different. \"I'm allergic to the dog, it's making me bleed and I'm extremely uncomfortable, I can't live together with the dog anymore so I'm looking for ways to move out if the dog is staying here.\" -- thats still an ultimatum. I cant see a way to get rid of it. Because the alternative is to not give the parents the option to give the dog away at all. They said no in a rather disrespectful way which makes yta make sense, but the context of all this is pretty much nah other than the phrasings used here?", "We have two sets of washer/dryers. I have one and my parents have one. My underwear was in the dryer and my dad opened it by accident, realised he opened the wrong one, then got his stuff out of the other one. The door was left open and the dog got in to it.\n\nI do my own laundry and my parents laundry occasionally.", "Another loophole in the story perhaps.", "Love pitties! I\u2019ve never had one myself but I\u2019ve fostered a few. The stereotype is such a shame.", "Thank you for explaining. I have genuinely never heard of that as a symptom, i even googled it!! Appreciate the info", "You miss the part about the itchy and bleeding undercarriage?", "I\u2019m calling BS on this. \n\nIf someone is bleeding from their genitalia they go see a doctor to get a diagnosis on why their vag is \u201cso sensitive\u201d it bleeds. Also, what if it developed into something more concerning than just a little blood? No one just shrugs their shoulders over a bloody crotch and acts like it\u2019s nothing.", "Tbh, that possibility hadn't occurred to me at all, as I automatically conflate the 3 steps of laundry (wash, dry, fold) into a single, efficient chore. \n\nAlso, when I was a child helping with the family laundry, I deeply disliked seeing or touching my parents underwear. By my teen years, I had developed a similar aversion to my parents seeing or touching my underthings,  which naturally accompanied me taking on my own laundry duties. My own child underwent a similar progression; expressing similar distaste first for handling the underwear of others, then for having others handle their underwear.  This led to my child doing their own laundry by the time they were 13. \n\nI admittedly assumed this was a pretty normal behaviour, and most everyday people who don't either treat their parents like domestic servants, actually **have** hired domestic staff, or have some kind of physical disability preventing them from doing so would prefer to wash, dry, and fold their own underwear. \n\nI admit that assumption blinded me to the possibility that she was washing everyone's dirty laundry, and is okay with her parents folding her clean underwear. Thank you for pointing out where my background experiences and assumptions blinded my assessment of the situation, and adding an additional scenario.", "Are you sure about the ages? Did they have postmenopausal IVF?", "Yes op parents sucks. It was already established. But it is their home and op is an ah. Op definitely if they can put up with it or move out, he can hold it against his parents eventually.", "I suspect OP's parents getting a dog was a subtle hint to move out", "Why would OP leave their freshly washed laundry in the laundry room rather than put it away?", "Most people are familiar with dander reactions, and don't realize you can also be allergic to pet saliva, too. Fortunately for me, just avoiding cats is on a whole easier than just avoiding dogs.", "It was like an adoption of a friends baby I think. They're very secretive lol. It wasn't through an agency anyway.", "Maybe they were busy and hadn\u2019t had the chance to put it away lmao", "19 when I developed a nut allergy, despite having grown up eating nuts. One day I had a handful and landed in hospital despite a month earlier being completely fine. It's not fun.", "I've had solar uticaria since childhood. It sucks.", "An allergist once explained to me that we are always one exposure away from developing an allergy.", "Oral allergy syndrome. He's actually allergic to ragweed, but his body mistakes it in bananas.\n\nMakes for some fun stuff to be allergic to, I have it too.", "Opposite here - cold urticaria. If it\u2019s below 45F, I get hives if I go out with hands/arms uncovered. Luckily I\u2019m ok with cold water, drinks, etc - just environmental, so far. Also luckily, I\u2019ve lived in desert countries and/or southwest US for the last 15 years. I can\u2019t really live in places with winter anymore.", "So I am not crazy! I was complaining about the same thing to my doctor in the last 3 years. Every spring to fall, my hands swell and are very painful whenever I go outside without thermos with ice water. And he tells me, \"It's nothing\", like duuuude I'm in pain and I can't do almost anything.....", "Does it happen with other fruits or just bananas", "Sweat urticaria is the worst! I have both heat and sweat urticaria so you can imagine how shit that mix is \ud83e\udd23 Urticaria sufferers unite!", "Wait, that\u2019s a thing? That would explain\u2026 so much.", "I had this following shingles, any sweat would cover my body in blisters. Made kickboxing interesting.", "It can happen with just about any fruit, vegetable, or nut depending on what pollens you\u2019re allergic to. I have oral allergy syndrome with almost all raw fruits, veggies, and nuts now, with some of them now being true food allergies. The list has grown since I was younger, likely because I continued to eat things that made me itch, not realizing those foods didn\u2019t make everyone itchy. Cooking fruit and veggies may denature the offending protein so it doesn\u2019t cause a reaction. I can eat some fruit or veggies raw in the winter when there is no pollen."]}
