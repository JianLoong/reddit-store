I was a teenage girl many moons ago and in hindsight, I was occasionally an a hole. You\u2019re doing all the right things and what is expected of you as a parent - letting your daughter know when she has crossed lines that should not be crossed. She might not be happy about that now, but hopefully in a few years she will be grateful to you for the way you have educated her. It\u2019s been 20 years since I became a reasonable adult, I still thank my parents for not indulging my bad behaviour and temper tantrums decades ago. Parenting teens is HARD but this too shall pass, like the saying goes. Well done you for educating your child properly!\n\nEdit: repetition (called myself an a hole twice, once was enough) and some typos.", "NTA. Teenagers are though, and you disciplined her in a constructive way that many parents are incapable of. Let her sob, she will get over it and hopefully reflect on her shallow statements towards her sister. If she speaks like that to her again, you do the same as you did here, and she will eventually figure out what is acceptable and what is not. Snobbery and bullying is so petty and obnoxious, so teaching her this in a young age will save her from a lot of trouble later in life. Fathers are the best.", "NTA! Well done for being a decent parent", "NTA.  Gotta nip that shit in the bud right away.", "NTA\n\nYou handled that well in my opinion. Your daughter needed to be checked and you checked her. Maybe when things have calmed down, you can talk to her about it more gently. Ask her how she would've felt if the tables were turned.   \nI'm also willing to bet that wanting to live with dad is just an empty threat. Just give it time.", "NTA She acted like a mean girl and there were consequences for it. If she values her clothes more than her sister then she needs to do some serious self-reflection, you're not in the wrong for giving her a reality check.", "NTA: It was a purposefully malicious comment. You\u2019re daughter is probably more distressed by the phone then the comment you made. A comment which was not over the top but a realization. She won\u2019t ever have anyone close to her if she treats people like that. I hope your adopted daughter is doing ok, I can understand how words like that can be damaging.", "NTA she was being cruel she deserved that XXx \u2728", "Gentle YTA for the reactive response. Take a beat and talk to Lila that she\u2019d have her phone and IG access revoked for a week as punishment, but that you apologize for how you handled it. Talk like a therapist and ask open, non judgmental questions like \u201cWhy did you make those comments to Trista? How would you feel if you were in her place? Is there anything bothering you that led to this?\u201d \n\nTeen girls face criticism from every angle. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Lila has faced snide comments about her being silly or superficial and hearing the same criticism from an adult, let alone her parent, can deepen these insecurities. Don\u2019t excuse her behavior of Trista, but don\u2019t ignore the need to have a serious conversation about *why* she\u2019s fixating on body image right now.", "As a parent of a 15 year old, NTA.

It was just the first time she was caught.  You can always call her bluff and tell her you will help her pack.  Funny thing is most kids freak out when that happens.", "NTA. I think you handled it perfectly fine.", "Agreed. NTA. It hit me as *Ghost of Christmas Present* vibes with the comment at the end. She wasn\u2019t seeing her actions and the impacts those actions could have. Teasing happens between siblings, but this definitely wasn\u2019t teasing. Kudos to you for stepping in and showing your kid appropriate boundary lines", "And deleter her Instagram account.", "You made me think of Judge Judy lol. She always says \u2018beauty fades, dumb is forever.\u201d", " i really do not think so, they honestly get along really well usually so this is out of the ordinary. my current theory is that Lila did this because she was having a bad week or something ( obviously that does not make it ok but i recall when i was her age i saw people say  and do mean things when they were stressed or upset or just took it out on the wrong person)", "thank u for the feedback:)", "not a dad. but ty for the feedback i understand what you mean", "I struggle with discipling in a proper way tbh because growing up i had parents who  were harsh and randomly insulted me and screamed alot so I just never got a sense of what a good parent was. Not that that makes it ok to not be a good parent as well. I try to be the best I can but theres always room for improvement.", "Nah nah nah, she did everything right, nothing wrong with what she said to her daughter, she was being vapid and she will end up being cruel if it continues. She didn\u2019t insult her looks or anything like that. \n\nI\u2019ve always said to my children, you never said bad things about someone\u2019s looks, but you sure as hell can tell them they have an ugly personality.", "she isnt obese. she was overweight even before we adopted her. She is losing weight aswell.. the fact thats ur main takeaway....", "I would also delete any other social media accounts of Lila\u2019s as well.  Her attitude towards her adopted sister seems a lot like she\u2019s been watching too many mean girl movies.", "I guess [kids can be cruel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_62lUMlknaY) but it was a nasty comment. Think you just need to have a talk with your daughter about why you snapped. You don't think that about her hobby but you were shocked about the viciousness of her comment and that it isn't ok to say that you sister \"wished she looked like you\" when you know she's working on herself.", "Hey OP? You might Check who she is following and watching. Fashion is a hell hole of fat shaming. And if she\u2019s constantly listening/watching that it may be feeding her cruelty.\n\nETA: NTA.", "I edited it for correction", "I don\u2019t find anything you said to be an insult. Sounds like it was the truth.", "thanks for the advice :) also that clip was amazing ahaha", "and yes she knows what vapid means. 15 yr olds are pretty smart.", "Can't beat classic Simpsons! No problem, best of luck!", "r/neverhappened", "NTA, your daughter is becoming spoiled. Where did she learn behaviour like this?", "NTA\n\nI think the apology is a fair request\u2026 however the insult to her hobby was a bit cruel. You might need to talk to her about that.\n\nAs for your daughter\u2019s behaviour, I wonder if there is an underlying issue. Is she maybe feeling a bit self conscious right now? Did someone at school say something to her that maybe caused her to become\u2026 well insulting and aggressive like this to her sister? Or maybe a hormonal thing caused by the menstrual cycle? Or maybe she has gotten insulting comments on her social media that is making her lash out at those around her? Teenagers are emotional beings with little impulse control and high reactivity levels who don\u2019t always think things through or lash out at the correct individuals\u2026 I can imagine if she got a harsh commenter calling her some kind of insult and her being upset about it would make her highly reactive and defensive about anything and everything. And possibly Trisha was the unfortunate victim of her lashing out.\n\nSorry, I am trying to think of some explanation for Lila\u2019s behaviour\u2026 what she did was wrong though. And your disapproval was warranted. I can\u2019t say I\u2019d have responded the same way but your response was warranted.", "NTA. Your first mistake was letting those comment slide in the beginning. Of course it's going to escalate. She's going to push just to see how far she can get. That aside, I don't think you said anything out of way or too harsh. Maybe it was too harsh because you aren't strick enough in general so when you do sort of push back it seems nuclear (I don't know I'm just guessing).\n\nDoes her dad want her to live with him? That's a discussion that can be seriously discussed. If he lives close by she can spend more time there with him and eventually transition to him have full custody (if that's what she wants). Doesn't make sense to force her to stay if she has another safe space to live. You don't want her to just take off one day (is she a flight risk?). If he wants her and is able to take care of her maybe see if she can live with her temporarily and see how s she likes it."]}
