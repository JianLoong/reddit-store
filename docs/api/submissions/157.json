It's not a competition. And if she has some triggers it's her responsibility to take care of them or at least begin with explain them to people she's living with so they can help with accommodations.

Your mom should be standing up for you and not letting z unload on you.  She sounds petty, jealous and childish.  You can't work something out if you don't even know what it is.  It's a ridiculous game and sounds narcissistic.  You don't need this drama and upset in your life.", "NTA. It definitely feels weird that Z, who is 21 year older than OP, is treating OP like that.", "NTA. You're an adult, so you're basically in a roommates situation, and your mom moved in a roommate who you don't get along with. You're not asking your mom to kick Z out or break up with her, you're just saying that Z is not someone you enjoy living with. \n\nTalk to your mom and your dad about your intention, and make it clear that you're not trying to punish anyone but just want everyone to feel comfortable at home, including your mom and Z.", "NTA talk to your mother first though. So she has the opportunity to see she's letting a manipulative snake stay in the house that will cost her, her child and has the chance to correct it.

Which a lot of newly divorced parents with \"adult\" (I say that lightly since your only 18) children will allow since they feel \"done parenting\" since their nuclear family is gone and the spice of a new relationship is more fun.

I am not always sure how reliable the narrator is regarding the situation, but the living situation is not working for OP.

This is not about you being good enough.  Given that your mom was in a vulnerable state and how quickly Z moved in, it is possible that Z manipulated your mom.  Z, who probably has a Cluster B personality, is likely being an asshole to you in order to drive a wedge between you and your mom, drive you to move out, isolating your mom.
