How did he get the money to pay for the games? It may be time to leave this one sided relationship.", "Let me summarize. He has no job, isn't looking for one, does nothing around the house, and plays videogames all day.\r  \n\r  \nThis sounds really great for him. What are you getting out of this, and is it worth it?\r  \n\r  \nYou discovery from two years ago simply adds fuel to the fire. You're **NTA** for ending a relationship that's been going on far too long.", "Yeah, it's not something that happened 2 years ago.  You found out NOW.  It's happening NOW. \n\nYour partner does not contribute financially. He doesn't work all he does is game. Doesn't celebrate important days. Doesn't share his money even when you are struggling. Doesn't clean.  Doesn't care that you are at the end of your tether.  What exactly do you get out of being with him? \n\nLike I get that having an addiction is not someone's fault.

If this was done at the depths of depression that he had climbed his way out of then started making things right that would be different. Your reaction now is you acknowledging how bad it really was and how selfish your boyfriend is.  You are right to acknowledge he does not have your best interests at heart.", ">I\u2019m having a hard time coping with this new information and I feel like I can\u2019t trust him anymore.\n\nYou have good reason to feel this way. He lied to you about an expensive purchase at a time when you were really struggling.

You are not wrong to rethink your future, although really late to the rethinking.", "NTA, but, like other commenters I\u2019m really wondering why you are still with him. Is it self esteem issues? Are you afraid of being alone? Did you take care of family members growing up and now identify as a caretaker/savior?\nYou deserve better than this. Get out now before you lose too much.", "NTA honestly I\u2019d probably leave. Fellow gamer here yeah you avg a decent time playing games and it is possible to spend $ whilst playing them, HOWEVER I always make sure to do stuff I need to do about the house first before I fire up some games or at the very least it\u2019s something that can be paused so I can do stuff at the same time.\n\nThe troubling part here is that he was spending what sounds to be recklessly and frankly if he spent $ over helping out/your bday that\u2019s not ok. Depression can make us forget and seek the little things that make us feel good but if you have a partner you should be able to communicate that with out worry and have someone to help you through it. \n\nBut yeah I don\u2019t know anyone that just dumps money into a game like even my most frequently played games I maybe put $15-30 into it per year and one of them is a gatcha which is designed to get you to spend money. Even games with monthly subscriptions are usually $10-15 a month. So if your bf was spending like $100\u2019s+ a month the only thing I can think of is cosmetic based games or stuff with pay to win features. Either way that\u2019s more than a problem and you didn\u2019t sign up for it and there sounds like nothing keeping you tied to him other than invested time. \n\nLet me be the first to say I understand feeling like you\u2019ve invested so much time into someone that you just want it to work but sometimes you just have people that are like this. Every relationship has its ups and downs but when the downs out weigh the good times you have to ask yourself is it worth keeping them around in your life. If there is a moment where you doubt it then it\u2019s time to let it go. Yeah it\u2019s gonna suck for a while but you\u2019ll feel better eventually. You\u2019ll still have some good memories to hold onto for a while but when it comes down to it you have no obligation to support him when he didn\u2019t support you.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re more than understanding, and obviously putting yourself through a ton while he\u2019s \u2026 doing him. I understand addiction is hard, and depression on top of that makes things even more of a struggle *but* communication is everything. You communicated, and he did not. I think he needs some time to himself to work on himself, and you need a break. Regain some of that independence, find someone who\u2019s put in the work, or spend sometime alone, and find some tranquility. You deserve better.", "NTA \n\nAnd should consider getting out while you can. He not only lied to you, he stole from you, and his priorities are clearly not you. \n\nWhat else is he lying about that you haven\u2019t caught yet.", "NTA. It didn't just happen 2 years ago. He has lied about it every day since. He also still doesn't act like a partner. He doesn't pull his weight and he makes excuses for his bad behavior. You were depressed, too. You still did what needed doing. If this relationship doesn't include trust and mutual support in times of need, what's the point? You deserve and can do better on your own. Plus, you can't find a real and true partner until you remove this guy, and make room for something better to come into your life.", "Girl what?? It is 2023, we do not support men who act this way??

That's a heavy burden to carry and specifically because you are choosing to carry it (and sounds like bf appreciates you helping him with it), it makes complete sense for you to feel hurt and as a result doubtful about whether you can continue. In fact, I feel it is very important to communicate this directly during a calm, constructive conversation:\n\n*\"I am committed to this relationship and want to stand beside you. In order to do that, I need to feel that you have my back. One of the ways you can do that is by being transparent with me as I am with you... I know it's hard to be vulnerable. You chose to when you told me the truth and I imagine it was very scary for you. Yeah, I was devastated when you told me, and I had strong emotions; ultimately, I am glad you told me because we now have a chance to work through this together. I'd like you to feel comfortable enough to share these things with me earlier on before things get too difficult... How might this look like? Is there anything I can do to make it easier for you to share these kinds of things with me?*\n\nOnce again, you are a wonderful human being.

You should have dropped him as soon as you figured out he was lying to you. You spent two years stressing about money and financial problems, you're never going to get those years back. You deserve better than this.", "Yes, I did. And I saw what was being said because I've been on both sides of that coin - - I've been addicted to video games, I've recovered, and I've also been involved with others struggling through the addiction. One of the things I have learned is ***responsibilities exist outside of the person*** and ***it is important to consider the person if they are to fulfill their responsibilities***. \"Too much\" means different things to different people - - I empathize with gf's feelings of frustration because she needs more in order to make the relationship more sustainable and equitable (100% with her, for what it's worth); I also empathize with the reality that a person recovering from addiction has to slowly move their comfort zone towards where \"other people\" have established their boundaries and how frustrating it is for people to only recognize \"effort\" when they pass the finish line, which basically means they have to push past *other people's feelings and judgment of their progress alongside **their own***.\n\nIf we're going to guess as to how the problem started, I'd hazard a guess at the depression being there first, with gaming filling a void and creating a false sense of success and/or purpose... Becoming an addiction when the temporary peace that comes with engaging in games gets blocked by things like paywalls and reality. I'm by no means justifying the bf's behaviour - - it's well established that his inability to pull his own weight created the first event in the first place... But even though it may *feel* connected, the gaming addiction isn't exactly related to OP's question so I've omitted my commentary.\n\n***\"He can't even improve his gaming behaviour, how the fuck does that look like becoming the person he is meant to be.***\n\nThrough hard work, determination, and sheer fucking will, my friend. And a supportive gf (whom I have commended for being exactly that) who is willing to be in the trenches. A lot of the \"improvements\" that are necessary to create the change we all want actually must happen internally - - the guy's gotta essentially replace his old mentality, perspective, and processes with healthier, more productive alternatives. Addiction isn't as simple as \"stopping\"... Gotta also find another way to get the fix and to keep it going with a good enough reason. And even with those, there's also the mental strength to stand up to those cravings and say, \"NOT TODAY!\"\n\nBF is receiving therapy. Done properly, he'll be putting in the invisible work. Closest analogy is supporting someone who's obese and helping them lose weight - - it isn't as simple as \"don't eat so much lol\". That's the most fucking annoying part - - ***there is no checklist for 'becoming the person you're meant to be'***.\n\nEveryone has their own journey; it's difficult to intertwine one's journey with another's if theirs is treacherous. There are consequences to all choices, and progress cannot be predicted, no matter how much we will it so. Progress comes with progress... Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n*some minor grammar edits*", "The fact that you typed out so much bullshit just to find excuses for OP's partner's shit behaviour, it's pathetic.", "I simply provided possible explanations, not excuses; the behaviours themselves, like I said, cannot be excused.
