{"id": 31407, "submission_id": "1809whl", "title": "AITA for getting annoyed with my boyfriend giving me unsolicited advice on a hike?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I go on hikes a fair bit. He is an extremely quick walker and is often ahead of me, especially if we're going uphill, and often out of sight until I eventually catch up and find he's waiting for me. I am not as fit as him but I'm also not too bad and I just need to stop and rest every now and then going up mountains and I get out of breath quickly but also get it under control fairly quickly once I stop. \n\nThere are 2 episodes of unsolicited advice from him I will detail (today's post being prompted by this morning's events), he quite often gives me unsolicited advice in life but these 2 have made me feel particularly infantalised. \n\nFirst one: One day as I eventually caught up to him out of breath he told me I needed to start breathing in a different manner when I walked. I hadn't asked for this tip, plus I'm well aware that deeper breathing helps when walking and do so especially when I stop to rest - he will not notice this of course as he never actually walks with me but always ahead and out of sight. \n\nToday we got up early to go to the top of a small hill to watch a sunrise. It's was pretty cold only 2 degrees c and after 50 minutes we decided to head back. My hands were freezing from taking photos so on the way back I had my hands in my pockets. \n\nEdit in response to comments: today's walk was not really a hike but more like a walk up a small hill, the kind you'd find in a city park or in the countryside in the UK. Not boulders or difficult terrain etc. it was pretty solid flat ground I was walking on and it was not steep. \n\nThis is the point he said 'take your hands out of your pockets because if you fall you'll get injured'. I said I'm not a child and I don't need telling what to do with my hands while I'm walking, and if I feel I've reached a bit where I need better balance I'm pretty sure I'm able to use my arms... I also said this is advice that is not needed much like the breathing episode. \n\nHe got annoyed with me for saying this and proceeded to walk ahead of me the entire way back, again often out of sight, and when I eventually got home to find him with the door shut in the bedroom he said he wasn't actually annoyed with me he just walked ahead to 'leave me to my ramblings'. This statement obviously made me pretty annoyed again. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700545713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1809whl/aita_for_getting_annoyed_with_my_boyfriend_giving/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The same way you could ignore him and treat anything he says as 'ramblings', I bet he wouldn't like it a bit. \n\nApart from that, what's the point of hiking together if he's out of sight most of the time?

That way only the fit person gets a rest to catch their breath.\nYour fitness to keep up with him will only improve by doing it and at a reasonable pace for you and building on that.\nI wouldn't go with him if he didn't respond to that feedback and instead I'd find a new walking buddy who is a better match.\nWhen it comes to the advice, he might mean well but it's how he is going about it incorrectly, i.e. without empathy. If he was more supportive you might have asked for his advice and not have conflict.\nSometimes fit people really don't know how challenging it is for people less fit than them.", "NTA\n\nDoesn't sound like you're getting along.

The sad virgins gang of reddit lol.", "NTA. \nYour boyfriend is a jerk.\nAlso, lifelong backpacker here. Your group ONLY goes as fast as the slowest hiker. \nAny person that leaves their partner or group behind is a jerk, and puts themselves and the others at risk.", "NAH. \"Unsolicited advice\" is what you make of it. If you guys get along well and this is a lingering point of contention, consider receiving the advice as a suggestion, considering it and moving on. It doesn't have to become personal. Often people will say \"you should do THIS,\" or \"you NEED to do that,\" and while they may think that, or word it that way, obviously you don't NEED to do anything, but you can consider the reasoning for their suggestion.\n\nIn the two cases you described, his advice had merits, but was worded or aimed poorly. He's right that there are ways to improve breathing technique. Default breathing is not necessarily the best or only way. He also has a great point about hands in pockets, especially if it was uneven, slippery or rocky ground. I've witnessed people falling with their hands in their pockets more than once. It's usually far worse than falling with hands free. Obviously, warm hands are preferable, too, but I don't see a reason for you to be annoyed at him for suggestions that have merit. However, I have similar experiences with having to be around people who CONSTANTLY say \"you need to....\" and \"you should....\" and it drove me nuts for a long time until I re-framed it.\n\nIf you foresee being with him for the long haul, tell him (if this is an accurate evaluation) that you think he gives advice a little too flippantly and that, while you appreciate that he is looking out for your best interests and has thoughts and feedback, you would also appreciate it if he could offer this in selectively, in moderation, and to be conscious of his wording. And just tell him how it makes you feel. Give HIM some unsolicited advice about his hehe. But I wouldn't shut it down entirely. Not getting any advice, feedback or thoughts from an SO is detrimental toa functional relationship so I would caution against pushing back categorically. I've straight up told people \"I value your feedback and advice, but I would prefer quality over quantity.\"", "Mansplaining. Not welcome.\n\nI have to remind my husband to stop trying to micromanage me.", "He can't be nice and walk with you?

He\u2019s the AH for giving unsolicited and demeaning advice, no matter how good or bad or subjective it may have been, and even more so for behaving like a child when you didn\u2019t want it! Don\u2019t hike with him anymore.", "Jesus.  When did a boyfriend or girlfriend making a simple suggestion to their partner  become 'unsolicited advice' that you need to run whinging to Reddit about?  I'll be the voice in the wilderness here and say YTA.", "NTA - I\u2019ve had conversations with male friends and past partners that I do NOT accept unsolicited advice. And it\u2019s always the men\u2026he\u2019s welcome to disagree with the way you do things, but if he has a habit of doing this it\u2019s important to sit him down when things aren\u2019t heated and explain that you no longer want any, and what repercussions there might be if he keeps doing it. \n\nHonestly, having your hands in your pocket is a danger (as someone who hikes and also regularly trips over things lol) so I think bringing up safety concerns could be an exception, but ultimately you get to decide how to handle yourself. He\u2019s being patronizing & annoying.", "nta i would be annoyed too if i kept getting unsolicited advice and then my partner walked ahead of me like that.", "nta, your boyfriend sounds condescending and inconsiderate. you're not a child and don't need unsolicited advice.", "nta, your boyfriend should respect your boundaries and not give unsolicited advice. it's annoying to have someone constantly telling you what to do. plus, if he's always ahead of you, what's the point of hiking together? sounds like he needs to work on his communication and consider your feelings more.", "NTA, he has 0 care for you while hiking. I walk significantly faster than my partner in day-to-day life, but if we walk together, I walk slower because, well, that\u2019s kinda how you walk **together**?\n\nHe fancies himself pretty highly above you in terms of capabilities, and that\u2019s trashy. \n\nAlso, unsolicited breathing tip while hiking: take a breath in, and then take one out. Doing this on repeat helps you to not die.\n\nIt\u2019s fucken breathing, it\u2019s got nothing to do with fitness, your capacity to breathe is hindered in physically strenuous exercise. Everyone\u2019s lungs are different, telling you to \u201cbreathe differently\u201d is like telling someone to \u201cthink happy thoughts\u201d when they\u2019re depressed. It means nothing.\n\nDefinitely NTA for voicing your opinion on the matter, that\u2019s absolutely baseline bare minimum of what a person should be able to do in a relationship.\n\nHis \u201cramblings\u201d comment is filthy to say the least, he\u2019s dismissed you and your feelings as being nonsense.\n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d be going for hikes alone. It\u2019s supposed to be an enjoyable experience, I\u2019d rip my hair out dealing with that shit.\n\nUnsolicited advice is frustrating in every situation, but telling someone how to breathe is next level.", "You are NTA at all. The childish part of me would like to start giving him unsolicited advice. But damn, I've been where you are so many times, it's exhausting.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, being a person that I love hiking and I like to do it with people who are at the same level of fitness, I think you are not compatible hiking buddies.\n\nIf he is like me, he hares waiting for people to catch up and this is why all the frustration.

Even people falling in the street have got hurt because they can\u2019t use their hands to break their fall.", "[deleted]", "You're probably not a great match\n\nHe likes to give advice\n\nYou seem like you wouldn't take advice from anyone \n\nLots of arguments ahead I'd say", "It's too late once their life's in danger, once she is airborne about to land on her face ots too late\n\nThen she will scream at him for not stopping it", "Sorry I didn't mean you I meant the comments all bashing on your partner for giving advice, I'm accustomed to gym culture where everyone passes on advice to each other even though most of the time we are already aware of such advices but it usually just ends up in a fun discussion since we usually share the same passion for training, I thought the same would be true for hiking.\n\nBut yeah if you've spoken to your partner about it and he completely disregards how you feel then he's definitely TA.", "That's exactly what I thought. No experienced hiker would leave a hiking companion behind, out of sight, especially when changing course. He just wants to show off how quickly he can walk and prove what a great little hiker he is. He isn't. Part of hiking in a group or a couple is to look out for one another. He's failing at that 100 percent. I quite enjoy hiking - I'd never ever hike with him.", "Exactly I think it's that it's phased 'you should...', you are absolutely correct there are better ways of phrasing things. \nI think it's because it makes me feel like I can't be trusted to make my own decisions much like a 5 year old can't. It's pretty patronising.", "Lol a face-plant, because you tripped, isn't \"life in danger\" in almost any circumstance \n\nIf someone doesn't explicitly ask for your advice it is probably safe to say they don't want it, and if you don't warn your partner about rough terrain you're an AH\n\nOh wait...\n\nOps bf is STILL an asshole, because he got so far ahead of her he was out of sight...  not much help to her at that point, is he?", "Agreed. What's the point of going on a hike with someone if they stride off ahead and leave you alone the whole time?\n\nDick move. Would not date.", "She sounds so painful I'd imagine most guys would get miles ahead of her", "I disagree, hitting any part of your head is super dangerous.", "Wow, personal attacks now\n\nYou sound like a gem \ud83d\udc4d", "No just an observation,  she sounds mighty strong and independent", "And that's a bad thing? \n\nI'm kind of confused now", "Well usually it's a polite way of saying insufferable", "Yeah I had interpreted your opinion of op correctly \n\nI'm not great with words sometimes, I apologize \n\nI don't think op sounds insufferable, I think she sounds annoyed\n\nBut I can see how it would come across as being insufferable/over confident to not take well meaning advice, especially from your partner"]}
