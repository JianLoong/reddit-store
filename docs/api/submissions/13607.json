I had very similar experience at your age. Best advice is to ignore it bc sister is being petty and your mom is favoring her. There\u2019s no winning here. Trying to prove you\u2019re right will just be tiresome and will probably fall on deaf ears.", "NTA. What your mum is doing is detrimental. And your sister seems jealous. \n\nHowever your weight is perfect for your current height, and assuming you're 14, you are still growing. \nSo I would put the losing weight to the side a bit, as your body needs all the nutrients it can get. Get sporty, get fit, but try to not mess with your food.\nI say this as someone who has had a severe ED growing up, and if there's one thing I could change about my life back then, it would be the relationship I cultivated with food in my early teens.", "Damn metric system. Damn education system. \n\nLet's see... convert to stone...11...stone to pounds...\n\nNTA, as a side thought. You told her to butt out and did not name call in your actions. All aok.", "NTA - your mom and sister sound verbally abusive.", "NTA. Tell your sister that if she feels the need to talk about your weight in your body all the time you\u2019ll feel free to talk about her problems and her weight and her body all the time.\n\nYour mom should\u2019ve told your sister that it\u2019s none of her business and to stay out of it.", "NTA . Your Mom and Sister are the Jerks. In fact it sounds as though you have a healthy body image, don't let them change that.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister has body image issues and she's trying to project those issues onto you (jealousy maybe?), and your mum is taking her side. Neither of these is OK.\n\nYou sound like you have a healthy self-image and are doing things for your health, which is great.", "NTA. Your sister and mom sound awful and kind of jealous. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a healthy weight, or taking strides to shape your body to what you want it to be. I'm really sorry you have to deal with your sister making remarks like this. I don't think people realize that you can be body shamed almost regardless of how you look. I was always pretty skinny growing up, and was frequently body shamed by others. The \"eating disorder\" remark that your sister used on you is one I often heard thrown my way. Being told I should eat more, or having people speculate that I must only eat salad or skip meals, etc., definitely had a sucky impact on me. \n\nI don't think people realize these remarks can be as damaging to an individual's body image as fat shaming. Either way, you're criticizing someone for how they look with the intention of making them feel bad. I think your sister is probably doing this because she is insecure with how she looks, and she doesn't like that you are now dieting and exercising and losing weight while she remains the same.", "NTA. Honey, you are OK. And you're well on your way to being more than OK, to being actively happy and happy with yourself and accepting of your own responsibilities and life. Don't let others project their insecurities on you, and don't accept their judgments because their judgments are based on their own perceptions, not on yours. I can tell by your words that a very good world is ahead of you. Trust yourself.", "NTA.\n\n>After that my mom and sister always told me I was fat on a daily basis (they both still weighted more)\n\nVerbal and emotional abuse and irony (them calling you fat but they weighed more than you)\n\n >Now my sister told my mom I had an eating disorder, which I do not. My mother confronted me\n\nMore verbal and emotional abuse\n\n>Well my mom bow makes me seem like a total jerk.\n\nFavoritism. Your mom clearly shows blatant favoritism for your sister.", "NTA Just stop associating with her if you could. If you can't then let her know she isn't respecting your boundaries and if she continues then you'll start pointing out the obvious... She'll respond with \"like what?!\" You'll respond \"why do you weigh more than me?!\" I know a mean move but, get her to focus on instead of you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
