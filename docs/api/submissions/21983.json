Before I read this, I started off thinking \"why wouldnt you have a baby cam\"... then I decided after reading... GOOD POINTS.", "NTA. Your home your rules. If your son and ex-gf don\u2019t trust you enough to watch their kid without observation then they shouldn\u2019t ask you to watch their kid.", "NTA. If it was her house then yea she's free to put up a camera. But since it's your house, she absolutely has no right to make you put camera in your own home, nor can she put one in without your own knowledge. If she has a problem then she can find a new sitter.", "Update\nMy son isn\u2019t the one who wants the camera, it\u2019s his ex.", "NTA. She has no right to monitor you on your son's time. If he trusts you, that should be good enough.\n\nEdit: it drives me absolutely nuts that fathers are sometimes seen as a lesser parent. He is just as much the child's parent as her and she should have no say about what goes on during his time, unless there were previous concerns", "Info: why does she have such distrust that the baby will be well cared for when with your side of the family?", "NAH. She can ask, you have every right to refuse, she can make a call if she\u2019s ok with the babysitting arrangement without a camera, and your son can go to court if she tries to be unreasonable.", "Absolutely NTA. This is YOUR house, YOUR rules.", "NAH:  If you're not comfortable with a camera in your home, that's fine. If your son gf has an issue, then your son need to find a new sitter.", "NTA", "NTA; You could offer to put a nanny cam or baby monitor just in the 4 month old's room as a compromise (again, your house, your rules).", "\"trying to find a way to keep his daughter from him\" there is a fine line between doing this and wanting to ensure her daughter is in a safe environment being well cared for especially when the child can't tell you about their day. \n\nI am not making any accusations bc I do not know you-  but I do know that statistically speaking most abuse is perpetrated by those closest to us, it's a sad and terrifying fact. \n\nyou don't have to accept, you also don't have to take the request as personally as you obviously are. It's been standard for years that daycare providers have cameras in their facilities that parents can view the stream, it's wise for a parent to have cameras if they have in home care. it's not an unreasonable to *ask* if cameras could be installed, if she is demanding/insisting that's another thing.", "YTA. You can say no to the camera in your home, of course. Your son can make up his own mind about a baby camera in his home. But you \"telling your son that his ex was trying to find a way to keep his daughter from him\" sounds like you're just sh\\*t stirring and it's not your business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP clearly states they are watching the child on son's time while son works, doesn't sound like mom has a say in that arrangement.", "Yea she can try but but she can't do shit.", "She\u2019s looking for ways to get full custody away from my son and keep us out of her life", "It\u2019s more she is trying to cover herself for putting the baby in danger herself.", "She was demanding. The baby wasn\u2019t even in the room she made my son put it in. She was with me in the kitchen when the camera got unplugged. So she was basically just watching my living room. She flipped out and the baby wasn\u2019t even in that room. \nTrust me I understand the daycare thing all too well. But like I said she is grandchild number 6 and if my daughter trusts me with all 3 of hers, not to mention I have medical training, then there is no need for the camera.", "I get where you are coming from. But there is a back story to that. She put the baby in harms way, and my son has a police report for this. She (more so her mother) has tried to make my son out to be the bad guy on numerous occasions, and I feel this is their way of trying to counter what was done by her. I\u2019m only looking out for my son and granddaughter at this point.", "There is nothing in the information you have provided here to support this assumption.", "you are missing one big point though, she doesnt trust you, she doesnt trust your daughters judgement either. They are going through a break up, HE needs to deal with the ex. If you dont want a camera in your home, that is fine. But she can give her own views on it because it is her baby too.  FYI just because this is grandkid no6 does not mean anything in the scheme of things. \n\nSon and exgf need to get court orders in place to work out what rules they have to follow. Stop inserting yourself into this situation.", "Okay, well that is important information to include in your post!", "So?", "I am in no way inserting myself into anything other then to give my son advice (as what mothers should do). He can either take it or leave it that is up to him. But demanding she be able to watch my home anytime the baby is not with her is outrageous. Even a judge would tell her what happens on dads time is dads business. Unless there were signs of wrong doing. Which up until now she trusted us completely and there were never signs of neglect or abuse.", "Right people use how many kids they raise as a reason they are a good sitter. While many people who have kids are abusive.", "I didn\u2019t know if I had enough space, as I\u2019ve never posted here before. I still think that the camera in my house is over the top. Considering when she was with my son, that was never a topic. IMHO she is safer here, but still that is only my opinion", "up until now you were here family, now you're her ex's family. I personally know 3 women from different families who were kidnapped by their father when they were children. \n\nagain, I am not accusing you of anything, other than possibly being a bit naive, but this mom's concernes are not baseless, no matter what your behavior has been like up until now or with other kids.", "Yup. I know a person in jail that raised all 12 of the grandkids and abused them all. Only found out because one grandkid told his older school friend what he had seen and what it was.", "I grew up in an abusive home. There is no way I would ever put any child through that. That is far beyond the point. Even if I had agreed to the camera in my home. The room the camera was in was empty. Nobody not even the baby was in that room when she flipped out. That there tells me she only wanted to watch everything that went on in my home. That\u2019s an invasion of privacy and illegal.", "My comment had nothing to do with the camera. Just your statement of how many babies you have raised should be a valid reason you are a safe sitter. \n\nI agree on your opinion regarding the camera.", "If I ever showed signs of being an abusive person, then I would somewhat understand. But she has know this family for years, and never once was she told or ever saw any abuse coming from here. I honestly get where some people are coming from. But not all families are abusive. And some of us are offended by the assumption that we are. Not coming at you sideways, just voicing my feelings at this point.", "NTA. Bet she doesn't plan on setting uo cameras your son can watch. She's just trying to stalk.  She'd have to prove the grandparent unfit and pay out of her own pocket for monitored daycare only once a judge sees this bs. No way would she be allowed a camera in the father's house. More likely a restraining order.", "Ex girlfriend and the sitting is during son's custody time.\n\nOP your son needs to get a formal custody agreement in place asap. That can include what monitoring goes on (maybe son wants to monitor during ex's time?)", "That\u2019s would be understandable, if it wasn\u2019t actually her her self that was the danger. She has bipolar and anxiety issues, and if she is off her medication, she get very violent.", "We are trying to get him to do just that. Do to her violent tendencies and what she stated herself to the police officers, we are advising him to go for primary placement. I\u2019m honestly worried about what could happen if she has another violent episode. Once again, I\u2019m only looking out for my son and his daughter.", "In that case, I would instal my own baby cam and keep the footage. If she hurts the baby and blames it on you, you then have evidence to protect you.", "That\u2019s already there as I have cameras for home security, but I have the only access to it. I have no fear of my private life going anywhere.", "You would be incorrect on what the judge would say. I have seen several friends have to put cameras up during their visit times and all court ordered so the judge can monitor the visits and alienation. None of them in my opinion would warrant it but in the day and age when people use their child as a weapon, I see why some order this", "I think they meant having your own cameras indoors that she has no access to just in case she hurts the baby and tries to blame it on you.", "That is what the meant and I have inside security cameras because of the world today.", "Then you're covered and she has no legal recourse. The rest is up to your son.", "NTA. You're doing them a favor, they have to take it or leave it on your terms. If it's your son's time and he's taking your terms (no camera) then tell this chick to go pound sand.", "No your son's ex needs to understand boundaries", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x4iho/aita_for_denying_a_baby_camera_in_my_home/jrlcnxr"]}
