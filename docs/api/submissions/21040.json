I asked my husband why he told him that, and he replied that it's the truth. That women allowed to be emotional and say things to anyone however we want, whereas he's had to withhold his emotions and set them aside. He said that since I'm a woman I don't understand, that I'm basically not allowed to have an opinion on it. He said he told our son that he's allowed to cry but sometimes you have to ignore your feelings and push through things because that's just how it is.\n\nI certainly realize I can't have an opinion on his experiences, because those are his alone, but I've seen first-hand how his relationship with his emotions and his beliefs on \"manliness\" has negatively impacted our life. I've seen how he diminishes an \"emotional woman's\" statements, and I've seen how it impacts my brothers and my father and I don't want my son to believe the same bullsh*t. I believe our generation, and generations to come, are encouraging and welcoming to men being more vulnerable. That doing so creates a less toxic world and a more whole man. \n\nI told my husband that I was sorry that society made him believe that to be true but it just isn't. He's sticking with the statement that since I'm a not a man I can't possibly understand that me teaching our son anything different would be bad for him. \n\nAITA for having the belief I have? Since I'm living in a females perspective am I truly ignorant to the male experience and would I be in the wrong for wanting my husband to get some intensive therapy to give him some perspective?

Had I been in your shoes I would have tried to talk more to your husband about why he thinks that your son should learn how to \"man up\" and to see where it is coming from. Perhaps narrate it as breaking the cycle? But if that doesn't work out, I think you're even safe to double down that you want your son to grow into an emotionally available and mature man that does not bottle up their emotions.", "You are both right here.  The truth is in the center.  When men never show their emotions and bottle them up, they are diminished as human beings and they suffer for it.  But men also need to learn to \"man up.\"  Society will not forgive us for crying at the drop of a hat, and your son will lose a lot of respect from other people if he cannot keep a reign on his emotions.", "NTA.

Men have it so rough already and we really don't need that stero type leading the way. I'm very emotional when I lose things I put value to. But even I was raised that there is a time and place for the cry outs. Definitely something on a world level that could be taught bringing men and women more equal. No your not the asshole and yall should discuss the parenting methods and morals for all children under the roof regardless of issues currently.. this way as parents yall have united front against them and stand together. Make sure he has the values you want to see in your son 20 years I grew up looking and acting more like my step dad then my biological (yes tested). There is a list somewhere of the 10 things to discuss before couples move in.. I slowly asked my ex those questions over 2 months before I was sure. Down side I didn't feel all her attention nor did I have it which made parenting sortive fall apart. Yall need to be rock solid <3 take it easy and have a wonderful weekend.", "NTA but his opinions both on men and on women wre concerning", "They should teach kids in middle and high school how to navigate crazy hormones and learn real life positive coping skills. Basic life survival skills\u2026 cook, hygiene, cleaning, growing your own foods, build a fire, change a car tire. A full semester on these type topics, effectively handling conflict, calm non defensive communication to allow time to share and time to listen with out interruptions or negative connotations. Be open to consider other opinions objectively based  on fact and research. The art of acceptable verbal communication flow. Overcoming discomfort and disappointment. Stress management, time management, money management intro, actual in person social acceptable behavior and inappropriate behaviors. How to not purposely offend a person, people. Or group of people by having some consideration for anything outside yourself.  Be a  Good winner or  loser and learning from failures and mistakes. Express your opinions without belittling anyone who may chose to disagree. Argument deescalation,  anger management. Reject the instant gratification freight train heading to a teen near you. Learning to be ok when your not ok and you can\u2019t be happy all of the time with no discomfort ever. This one was a hard wake up call for me and my generation. Trust building exercises. Learn to spot a liar or dishonest person by physical ques and not gullibility or being naive. And most importantly RESPECT other people, places, and things like they were the most important thing to you. Give respect and receive respect. Give harsh opinionated words, get at least that back.  No, offer kindness and compassion even to the meanest most hateful person you face. It\u2019s not as easy to be cruel to someone who is purposefully showing kindness. Not all people are equal in all ways. And standardized expectations will always fall short. We feel and share emotions differently, we perceive completely opposite opinions on ourselves to what others see in us. We communicate differently. But we allow biased influence from multiple sources during our growth to adulthood. The old statements of \u201cgirl vs boy\u201d normal themes are lies that have been passed down for generations. Boys and men\u2019s don\u2019t have the tough manly attitudes and careers always. Women aren\u2019t stuck in the home trying to make their families appear perfect and waiting on the kids and boys. And there has been a shift in family dynamics that must be addressed. Modify the new requirements for learning to be a beneficial member to our society in whatever capacity possible. Every talent, skill, gift that we have individually and collectively has substantial value! Teach the new way to do things in our changing and advancing world. The old stuff doesn\u2019t apply or have value in today\u2019s economy. Change is positive growth, even when it feels impossible to achieve. Shall we hate someone because they are different or oppose the same beliefs, morals and ideals that we stand for. Do you deny their devotion to these or devalue their worth because having little to no education or knowledge in these different beliefs. If you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to consider the teachings and followings of other groups, how can you confidently accept or deny any part of which you have no understanding. Did you just take that belief because that\u2019s what your family or community has always supported. That is being silenced in you to consider and form your real stance. Do you know all of the sides to the story or only what your Grandma and Grandpa told you. It\u2019s this generation of parents right now that can break the stereotypes and support and force change in ourselves and all the way up to the top leaders that are so detached from the reality of American culture injustice and misinformation. It\u2019s up to each individual to have a truth based non opinionated news reporting to be able to make a confident and informed decision before making impactful decisions as to the leaders of our government. And the decisions that we will face in the coming years. Take responsibility and be proud that we each have our own voice. Conflict will always exist, but peace talks will always prevail over war and violence.", "NTA \n\nAsk him what the worst thing that could possibly happen if your son expresses his emotions are.", "NTA. I\u2019m a guy and men absolutely should show emotion. Bottling it up is both unhealthy and unfair to those around them.", "Your husband's attitude will only hurt your son in the long term. Boys learn young that in order to become 'men' they need to suppress any emotion that isn't anger/frustration, because it's seen as feminine/weak, and it messes them up for their entire lives (adult boy here). You're also the kids parent and you get a say in what version of manhood your son is indoctrinated into. NTA", "NTA - this would be the attitude that would make me think about if I really want to raise a son with this man.", "Not an arsehole, because you are looking at thru a womans eyes. You husband is right, a man's world is far different, and he doesnt need therapy, He's doing what a good male role model would do ! And your not setting him up for failure, but a more difficult life. Your also interfering in the father/son bonding process, which so many young men need and crave. I did and said many things to my sons as they grew up, that their mother would flip over. All my sons are now grown, are really great young independent respected men and have even thanked me for the lessons i taught them thru their life.", "YTA. He needs to learn how to control his emotions. Raising boys to be emotional isn't beneficial for them or anybody around them. There's nothing attractive about a weak man who cries. I've never met a successful man who had emotional responses to life. \n\nBoys need to learn how to become men, if there are no men to teach that they either become prey to toxic influences like gangs or they become feminised  and weak which is a bad thing if they want to succeed in career or relationships.", "NTA.\nThis way of thinking is the essence of toxic masculinity.\nDoes he like Lord of tge Rings? If he does, tell him that Aragorn is a great example for healthy masculinity. Hes is a fighter that slashes Orks and is a fierce fighter but still doesn't fear to be gentle, to show more emotions than lust and anger and doesn't push aside his sadness and pain for anyone, he shows them openly, just as he shows affection. *That* should be the ideal.\nThe idea that women are more emotional comes from a place of male insecureties, a place of fagile masculinity, the same place whefe men get the odea that touching an other man automatically makes them gay and stupid stuff like that.", "For real, big yikes. Instead of teaching his son that he can be part of the the change that allowed men and boys to be vulnerable, he is just shaming the poor kid instead. NTA, op, but I feel bad that you have to put up with a spouse with such mindset who will possibly pass it on to your son\u2026", "Thank you for the advice, I will definitely try to see if he can talk to me about where it originates from. It makes me sad that men have been made to feel like they couldn't have safe spaces to have emotions. His history isn't an easy one, and he certainly didn't have good coaches on how to process feelings. I just didn't realize how embedded his pain/practice was, as I was pretty sure we were on the same page.", "Just out of interest, what is a 'noodle holder'? I googled the phrase and I am 100% sure that you didnt mean a cooking implement lol\n\nAlso, I agree. I made a similar comment.", "I agree. \n\nHusband didn't say the kid COULDNT cry, or show emotion, but that being strong is an important quality too.", "Sorry for the rant. One thing lead to the next. I\u2019m in  no way  critical to our education or institutions of government. Forward thinking in a respectful manner. These are completely my personal opinions and have no ties to any of the subjects mentioned. I have a difficult time voicing my thoughts on high profile topics, but it feels good to get it out. Moral of the story related to the thread. You are NTA.", "Probably a phrase meant to convey \"a man\". You know, as a have of the dangly bit?", "Ah that makes sense. Thanks!\n\nOn the plus side I wasnt aware of the existence of those cooking implements.", "Yeah this right here."]}
