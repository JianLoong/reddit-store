She got with her friend\u2019s ex completely ignoring the girl code.

Maybe if she listened to op this would not be happening!!!", "Sounds like Sue did that thing insecure people do, of assuming - and hoping - that when your ex picked her, he'd be different to her. It's the same mindset people who date married men have. \n\nSue listened to your complaints about him, thinking, \"he treated you like that, it'll be different for me\". The pregnancy forced her to stop lying to herself.

Are you supposed to listen, support her and be there for their child when things progressively get worse.. yikes!", "NTA. She knew using you as a shoulder to cry on was making you relive all the same shitty things you went through. Her expecting you to simply switch off your own emotions and focus on helping her with hers was selfish and unreasonable, she is in no position to complain that after an hour of this you weren\u2019t particularly sensitive and understanding - it\u2019s not as if you laughed or insulted her.", "NTA - how good a friend was she really though? No good friend goes out with an EX a few months after a breakup.\n\nDollars to donuts that they were already f#\\*ing and that's why she was so invested in you leaving your EX.

I mean of he messaged you soon after your friend started dating him, that is just weird. You warned her she didn't listen and she became upset with you because you didn't want to listen to her whine about it. I say good riddance and hope that she doesn't try to contact you again. Honestly there are people who just enjoy creating drama in their lives for some reason. Did she really think dating her supposed Best Friends toxic ex boyfriend was going to end well?", "I was gonna say the \u201cI told you so\u201d was unnecessary, but after reading up comments about him taking advantage of you and assaulting you, I\u2019m really really sorry your friend didn\u2019t support you and is not reaping what she sowed\n \n\nI hope you\u2019re in a better place now, he is horrible and your friend, without deserving it, had it coming.

I can't be a councilor to them in that situation, I'm not able to just listen or be what they want. Because it triggers so much stress for me. I try to listen to them. But at the end of the day, they keep choosing to stay in the situation and complain to me about it. I made the choice to get out.\n\nSo I can completely understand Op not being able to cope with dealing with being dumped on with all the problems that she warned her friend about. As well as not being in the headspace to formulate a nice little platitude for her.", "I usually would agree with you, but you are forgetting that OP is one of his victims, too. Even in your example, the abuser was a random person and not a person who abused you. OP's best friend went to the hardware store for bread. She expected to get sympathy, and while she got it, it was not in the way she wanted it to be. The best friend's feelings as a victim should be respected, but so should OP's feelings as a victim who has now had her trauma reopened with new ones added.", "Dude are you 12?  A Disney villain?  No this is someone who chose to ignore about 500 red flags.  This is past the point of sympathy.  \n\nPlus you keep making shit up.  None of your statements are even remotely true", "That\u2019s part of the trap, you provide and you take care of him", "If she leaves, then she doesn't have to pay for his expenses.", "She is still a victim. Many women date abusers, many don't listen to their friends and families who warn them. It doesn't matter what someone did and how shitty they were, they do not deserve to be in abusive relationships. \n\nI am not trying to be Mother Theresa jfc, I am stating that it is a slight ah move to kick a victim while they're down no matter how much they \"deserve\" it. No one deserves to be stuck in an abusive relationship no matter if they \"did it to themselves\"", "All of that is correct but doesn't negate my comment. She should apologize to op, that does not mean we should pull an I told you so. Like I said, someone could be the worst person and I wouldn't kick them while they're down like that. That's just my morals though and I realize everyone is different.", "I definitely understand your perspective. I did edit my original comment because people think I'm calling op TA. I myself have gone through abusive relationships so i get why op reacted this way. I think op is NTA bc while I personally wouldn't say that because it is somewhat kicking them while they're down, I get it 100%", "Op doesn't have to help her, it is still a slight ah move to tell a victim (no matter if they did it to themselves and \"deserves it\" blegh) \"I told you so\" it does nothing but kick someone while they're down. Just because they were shitty and didn't listen to you and were unkind to you, it does not mean they deserve it.", "Yes agreed, sue should apologize or shouldn't have gone to op in the first place", "Well it has happened, what\u2019s past it prologue you can\u2019t change it. \n\nYou can only deal with the here and now. You can act with grace or be a spiteful shrew. How you conduct yourself when faced with scenarios like this is a reflection of your character.", "Point to me what I made up in my initial post about the entire situation?   I said she's an arsehole for saying I told you so.\n\nAnd the Disney comment is called an archetypal name. Just because you're comparing them to a disney character doesnt make you twelve.", "Bingo. That's why you read all these stories of single mothers expressing how much easier it is to do it all alone than when their ex was in the picture, essentially creating so much extra work for these women.", "You are still pretending that consequences don't exist. The only thing she is a victim of is her own naivet\u00e9 and to a larger extent her stupidity. This does not mean in any way that she deserves it, and by no means should she be ignored to endure further abuse. It is simply the consequence of her actions and decisions. This is the cold truth you refuse to accept. \n\nIf you fall into a hole, people will gladly help you get out, hoping that you're ok. Your thanks is all they need in return.\n\nIf you dig a hole so deep you can't get yourself out, people will still help you out, but they're going to need an apology in return.\n\nOP can't do anymore for her friend than tell her to leave, which she has already done by example. If she chooses to stay in the hole she dug, then OP will have no choice but to use force, or watch on in horror. Who is the victim in this scenario?", "You aren't a better person. You believe that helping Sue would make a difference. It's about belief that you have and someone with the previous experience with that person no longer has. Also, you are saying unkind judgemental words to OP who was also the victim in that situation.", "Stop your victim blaming. OP didn't say that Sue deserved that, it sound like \"remember what I told you when (insert event)\" Sue could say that yes, OP told her and that would be validating and maybe OP would be able to offer at least some help like finding different place to live, etc.", "I am glad you agree, but that's not what you wrote in any of your comments. OP saying, 'I told you so' came out from her trauma. OP went crying to Sue about the abuse, and Sue didn't listen to OP. Was it the best thing to have said to Sue? No. As a sexual assault victim (though I prefer survivor), I can understand saying things without thinking to protect myself and then feel awful the second after the words left my mouth. I think there are NAH. Minus the ex. Both women are victims of this jerk who doesn't care about anyone but himself.", "Both of them are victims.\n\nSue shouldn't have gone to op\n\nOp should at the very least not said I told you so.\n\nI'm gonna repeat: OP is NTA, but it is still a slight AH thing to do. OP is a victim of abuse, so I get why she reacted like this which is why I say she is NTA. Op is NTA. Doing a slight ah thing does not mean I believe that she is TA. I think OP is NTA.", "Where did I say i was a better person holy shit. \n\nMy only 2 points:\n-Sue was wrong and should apologize\n-It's still kind of an AH move as it somewhat kicks someone while they're down.\n\nJesus christ", "I didn't say op said that. The () was what it could be interpreted as.  You keep twisting what I'm saying and it's frustrating. How many times do I have to say that I don't think op is TA, just that the action itself is a slight AH move. I'm so tired of this. I hate how people don't understand what I'm saying. I'm not victim blaming op, nowhere did I imply she deserved the abusive relationship.", "I agree that OP is NTA. \n\nI apologise for being combative, but I believe people in general are neglecting personal responsibility. Harbouring individuals from consequences by continually painting them as victims does more harm than good.\n\nFor instance, if Sue hadn't taken the victim stance of \"why is this happening to me?\", and instead taken responsibility and said \"I'm so sorry, you were right, please I need your help\" this entire post would not have happened because OP would be moving heaven and earth to help her friend.", "Here you said: \"but that's just my morals, guess everybody is different\" \n\nLike you were the moral person and others fialed to be as good as you. Anyway. You showed zero sympathy for OP when she was victim and Sue made her feel like She thought OP lied. You say again and again that saying \"I told you so\" makes OP TA, you aren't able to admit OP deserves to be recognized as someone who didn't lie about her own abuse. If Sue isn't ready to admit OP didn't lie about her own abuse, she has no right to ask her for help. I am sure other people who weren't hurt by Sue as OP was will be better choice to help."]}
