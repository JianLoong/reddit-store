Are you supposed to listen, support her and be there for their child when things progressively get worse.. yikes!", "NTA. She knew using you as a shoulder to cry on was making you relive all the same shitty things you went through.

She needs help. We all make mistakes sometimes, from small to huge. And some of us learn some of our lessons the hard way. That doesn\u2019t mean she deserves to suffer for the rest of her life because of some dumb albeit big mistake she made. Someone needs to get her out of this situation and ASAP.

If you wanted to say that to her, that's a you thing, but I think your timing was far less than optimal. My unwarranted advice if you want to fix things is to apologize that you said something hurtful (not that you said anything wrong or untrue). She knows you were right, you know you were right.
