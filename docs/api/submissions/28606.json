We dated, everything was great. We got engaged and moved in together. Within 10 months I realized he had a serious issue with maturbation, laziness, and some other stuff. Sue (25f) has been my friend for YEARS and was supposed to be my maid of honour. She was upset about the break up but one day called and said Dave asked her out. This was a few months after the breakup. Im not a gatekeeper. I just said, \"Sue...Hes not a good guy. Your like a sister to me and I wouldnt want my sister involved in the same situation I just got out of.\" I added some situations. I said hey Im not perfect either but the relationship was far from balanced and was so.toxic. the ring or apartment didnt help. \nShe said she understood. Next week they started dating. I just removed myself. I had blocked my.ex and saw he sent me a message on socials but blocked and deleted all of it. \nNow, a year and a half later. \nSidenote: I caught my ex trying to mess with my birth control once, which made my sex drive/trust just fall and was a big domino in our breakup. He wants kids yet cant bring himself to shower more than 1 in 3 days. \nShe called me crying. They are now engaged (with the ring I gave back to him)  and she is pregnant. Shes at the end of her line. He doesnt help with the house and pays little on bills. He told her (his pregnant gf) to go donate blood if she was so worried about money. I let her cry for an hour. How hes lazy and refuses to work, his negative attitude, and how hes sexting bots online but how it isnt cheating since its AI. How lazy and shitty he is. She even retold stories that I told her of what he did to.me!!! \nI felt numb to listen to it and just thanked god it wasnt me.  THIS was what I was afraid of. This is why I left him. At the end I just mustered, \"Sue...I told you this would happen when you started dating...\" Not like a sneery jab, just an emotional, honest one. She hung up. She hasnt tried to contact me.since. \nAITA for trying to tell my bff how my ex was when they started dating and being unsympathetic now that the same things I told her are coming true?!?!?", "created_utc": 1696913408, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174cujt/aita_warning_my_friend_about_my_ex_who_she_is_now/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I bet she also encouraged you two to break up because she secretly wanted him and \u201ccould fix him\u201d NTA. If she won\u2019t get herself out of the situation I would cut contact tbh.

The whole time he skipped work and went through a few different jobs. Hed play loud video games until 4am. Hed eat in bed so that there was crumbs in the sheets, and was over all just such a hassle.

Also, *why* is she still intent on marrying him?", "Good grief, all things considered, you\u2019re being way too nice to her, OP. It would be more than enough if you had just wished her good luck and then distanced yourself from her. You think she\u2019s your bff, meaning she is supposed to care about you and show some loyalty to you, but she was so eager to get with a guy that she *knows* treated you very badly that she just disregarded all that and ran right to him. That\u2019s not something a real friend would do.\n\nAnd she\u2019s been using you to make it more comfortable for her to cope being with an awful guy who she knew did her friend so wrong. And you\u2019re letting her use you. Why? Stop it. Consider it a blessing that she\u2019s avoiding contact with you. Make it permanent. Put that one-sided friendship in your rear view, and let her deal with reaping what she\u2019s sown, without any more help from you.", "What is saying \"i told you so\" supposed to achieve besides validation for yourself? Does that help the situation? Will it make her mistakes less or is it only to make you feel better?\n\nNo shit the friend is an idiot, she told her about the mess of a guy and her friend still went for it. But you know what? As a friend, your job is to pick them up when they're down and not to kick them further in the dirt.\n\nIf she washes her hands of the situation, then good for her. But there's no need to say \"i told you so\", it's the worse thing you can say when someone is bearing their heart to you.", "I believe there\u2019s a time and place for saying \u201cI told you so\u201d. Saying that at their worse does not help the situation, it only makes it worse cause the person at fault would become defensive or just not listen. There\u2019s plenty of ways to skin a cat, but using a butter knife in this case is just not it. \n\nI woulda just dumped the friend or kept them at arms length if they dated my ex without listening to why we broke up in the first place. \n\nYour English is fine btw, you got your point across and that\u2019s all that matters.", "Im not trying to be a defensive dick but damn, where is the line drawn?\nI would argue the righteousness. He fucked with my birth control pills. Hed get me black put drug and do anal. Just...hes a shit bag. She knew these stories and encouraged me to break up with him!! Now shes dating and complaining that hes doing the same to her? Wtf. \n\nHey, I do appreciate this. Be my angel on my shoulder. Im.hella conflicted", "But the thing is, she\u2019s obviously *not* \u201ca good friend\u201d. A good friend wouldn\u2019t do what Sue did, get with OP\u2019s awful ex a few months after encouraging her to break up with him, and then come crying to OP for sympathy when he treats her the same way he treated OP.\n\nThat is some ridiculously self-centered AH behavior, there\u2019s no element of friendship in how Sue is treating OP, so no she does *not* deserve OP\u2019s sympathy. And OP was still a lot nicer to her than most people would be in similar circumstances.", "The friend when they didn\u2019t listen unvalidated what the ex did! So yeah I told you so it totally acceptable in this situation. \nAs a friend of you are supposed to pick your friend up when they are down, why didn\u2019t the friend do it to op?? Why is only about friends when it\u2019s the other way? She is lucky op didn\u2019t laugh at her when she started complaining about the ex!", "I can see you are really struggeling and obviously the situation is not easy for you, considering she is a good friend. I honestly cannot understand what's going on in her head, tbh. If she does not want to learn from your *and her own mistakes*, then I guess you're allowed your \"I told you so\". I'm going to change my opinion to NTA. Still, be kind to her and try to support her (just not in her wedding endeavours, because hell no!)", "Sheesh, Kick them when they\u2019re down and laugh in their face. What are you? A Disney villain, you sound like you\u2019d have a seat at the table with Cruella and the Evil Step Mother.", "Lol yes kick them when they are down. She got with her friend\u2019s ex completely ignoring the girl code. She ignored everything her friend said\nAbout said ex and then got pregnant by him and is now complaining exactly what her friend said about him. Yes a full out evil laugh! She ruined her damn life and the life of the baby she is carrying because she is a nasty backstabbing friend! I told you so and laughing is appropriate. \nI mean how could this of not happened???? Maybe if she listened to op this would not be happening!!!"]}
