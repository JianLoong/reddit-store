Stop saying it's fake.", "Very gentle YTA,\na pair of palazzo pants could have done wonder for a formal event. But you really looked lovely, for any other occasion you would have been perfectly appropriate.", "Leggings to a wedding? \n\nWhere is Blair Waldorf when you need her?", "Did you get mistaken for being the wedding planner?", "If it had been a suit or a pant suit it would\u2019ve been fine it\u2019s the casualness of leggings", "Your shoes and blouse are fine for a casual wedding.  The leggings?  LOLOLOLOLOLOL nope sorry", "As someone who detested wearing dresses throughout my entire childhood and have only just started finding dresses I'd like to wear in the past few years I sympathize with you. But for semi formal family events, its always best to check the dress code verbally especially if you are opting for a non traditional choice. It took a photo of me in the quirky print dress I was thinking of wearing to the first family gathering since covid, to remind certain family members that my sense of fashion is a little different to most. Got guidance from a more fashion savvy family member. Ended up going to the event in a purple dress with large rose print. My original choice was a blue dress with dinosaur print with matching accessories. It was considered not suitable but is now my default if not told otherwise for semi-formal/formal big events this is what I'm turning up in outfit. While I understand not wanting to bother the bride in the build up to the big day, YTA for not sending an image asking for at least an opinion.", "More wedding drama like who cares. Half my husband's very large family show up in jeans. We still have fun & know who the star of the show is. Some like to dress up others don't. All these brides afraid they're not the center of attention is ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nLeggings are not wedding appropriate even with heels. Maybe if you went with a jumpsuit, trousers, or a skirt, then sure.  Looks more like a desk job outfit not a wedding look.", "YTA \n\nAssuming the dress code wasn't as clear as it could have been and you perhaps not reading the metaphorical room, I feel fault lies on both sides here, but the onus is on you at the end of the day to make sure what you want to wear is event appropriate.\n\nHonestly, the outfit is fine, it's just not very weddingish. It's giving office casual, not nice dinner event. A more formal pant and some more styling could have dialed this up a little bit to make it more appropriate. Always assume formality at a wedding unless told otherwise. You don't even have to wear a dress for formal, but you need to put more finishing touches on things.", "YTA For posting about this same outfit AGAIN. Quit wearing it. Leggings are not work or wedding appropriate", "You posted this same photo previously, regarding asking if this outfit was office/school job appropriate. Unless you're just a copycat and have stolen the photo.", "You really look lovely, the blouse is a gorgeous colour on you but I think the look could have been elevated with slim cigarette pants instead of leggings, it\u2019s still a figure hugging fit but just a smarter cut & more formal fabric. I\u2019m saying NTA because, you weren\u2019t dressed super-inappropriately, it\u2019s a very modest outfit & really I think it\u2019s a bit unhelpful of the bride to have asked this, it\u2019s not like we carry spare dresses in our purse to weddings - so you couldn\u2019t have done anything about it", "She knew, she just didn't care.", "Honestly, OP could have dressed the shirt with a nice pair of slacks/trousers or even a skirt.", "Is it, look in my bio, I never said this was taken at the wedding I said this was the outfit.", "Thanks, I knew this picture was familiar and OP, sorry, but it\u2019s not appropriate for a wedding or school.

Unless the wedding is at a gym.", "lol...leggings would NEVER be appropriate for a wedding, unless it's a wedding held as a gym workout.", ">I\u2019m open to the possibility that the invitation left an opening for it.\n\nAnything short of specifically inviting guests to show up wearing leggings would indicate they are not even remotely appropriate wedding attire.\n\nYTA.", "I don't think anyone actually would have cared that she didn't wear a dress if she had, as you say, made any effort at all to dress smartly. I think E-S-H is probably an overreach because I suspect that anyone who scolded her for not wearing a dress probably didn't specifically mean \"only a dress\" but \"something nicer than leggings\" and \"dress\" was just the obvious thing that came to mind. \n\nI'm pretty sure OP is the only AH here.", "Yeah I never said this picture was from the wedding, like I told the other person that is my main account, this is my alt account, I have it in my bio and you can even go ask the \"other\" account and it'll be proven.", "Used the same picture cause it's the same outfit.
