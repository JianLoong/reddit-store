We have a great relationship. \n\nYour mom is putting herself before you and guilting you. That's not okay. You're not responsible for whether she has meaning and value in her life with you gone. That's on her. We parents love our kids, but there's a world and a life beyond kids. She's being selfish and I hope you guys can sort this out. It's okay to go away. I hope you have a wonderful time!", "NTA and your mom is probably like that because your grandma\u2026 you have to grow and be your own person. You would have difficulty doing this continuing to live there. Applying to jobs for you?? Most parents would be thankful that their children have the initiative to do this.

As a mother I cannot imagine trying to clip my child\u2019s wings like this. She needs to take her feelings to therapy, to her support system, instead of dumping them all on you. It\u2019s okay to miss your kid but she needs to first and foremost support you.", "NTA.

Her purpose is to raise you to the point where you can go out and obtain a life of your own. She's done that and you don't have to feel badly that you're ready. It's time for her to reclaim her own life and identity outside of being Mom. It's a scary process and hurts some, but you can't let her create an unhealthy dynamic in your relationship.\n\nSomething tells me that your sister forged her own path and your mom comforted herself by saying, \"Girls will leave, but I'll always have OP.\" And to a degree, you're probably a laid back type that didn't kick against her smothering ways too much so she thought everything was status quo.\n\nIt's time though....\n\nFly little bird, FLY!\n\nMom will eventually be okay.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s your decision and she needs to respect it.

Your mom may be upset about having an empty nest, but that's her problem, not yours. You can't live at home with her forever.

I use public transit and already I need to work around the schedule, the train is going to be a lot more expensive and a lot more inconvenient.

Dorm life isn't even permanent, you'll return home the summer unless you end up staying with your sister or some friends between sessions when the dorms are closed.\n\nDon't let your mother's anxiety hold you back, if she's the type of person you can have a conversation about it with these are some good points to bring up. If not maybe reassuring her you'll be coming back in the summer could help her loosen her grip?", "NTA - You have done no wrong, and it\u2019s much better to stay in dorms the first year, so you can stay focused. Now, I don\u2019t actually think your mother is coming from a bad place, just that she\u2018s going to miss you. Also, in college, you can\u2019t just drop everything and go to your mother, that costs a lot of money and it causes you harm in the long run.

My youngest currently in last year of college and am so proud of how well she has done.  Part of that was us both letting go of each other and trusting her to do well on her own.

You NEED to go live in the dorms. You need independence and freedom.

I don't know.", "This is basically what I came to say. Ideally, your kid leaving for college should be bittersweet, like so many parenting moments. The bitter part should come from the fact that you\u2019ll miss your kid because you love your kid, like your kid and have a good relationship with your kid. But the bitter should be outweighed by the sweet, by the happiness and pride you feel at seeing your kid grow, mature and go off to lead the life they want to lead. I\u2019m speaking from experience. Of course I missed my kid when they went off to college, but I wanted them to go because it was the right thing for them. They loved it and I was very happy about that. \n\nNot only is your mother being run of the mill selfish by prioritizing her sadness over your eagerness for college and the start of an adult life, but her overprotectiveness is pathological. Worrying about your newly licensed driver is normal. Refusing to let them drive is crazy. Not letting them near a stove is also nuts. Lots of kids learn to cook. I was baking in elementary school and there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about that.\n\nGo to college. Do not go home every weekend. 2-3 hours away by train?

Join a frat. Don't call every other hour and don't accept her calls at all times of day and night that she will inevitably call. Start out telling her that you will call once a week on Sunday for like 30 minutes. If she attempts anything outside of that, be too busy or eating or in class or sleep or anything really.", "LOL.

So no dating, I'd rather not die of embarrassment especially if my imaginary girlfriend found out I don't know how to cook and do chores", "you can thank my sister for that, she's always trying to keep me humble", "you're so right, can't believe I didn't see it sooner", "thanks! Unfortunately her mentality isn't \"only I can do it right\" it's \"if you do it you'll get hurt so I'll do it for you\"", "This is definitely over the line into emotional abuse. It sounds like your mother has never let you have your own life, and views you as just an extension of her. No wonder she's upset that you're leaving. \n\nIt's great that you're starting to learn and do all the things she stopped you from learning and doing.

It's a covert type of abuse and she's ensuring you will never be able to be without her (it doesn't actually work that way, but many people are then scared to leave their parent because they were never prepared to) It's completely fucked, completely selfish of her.!<\n\nYour mom should have sought out therapy years ago. Youre doing right by growing up and being an adult and leaving. If she wanted a baby forever, idk what she should have done, but babies grow into kids. Kids grow into adults. If she cant cope with that, its certainly not your job to make this pill easier to swallow. If you ever need a big sis who will tell you how it is or otherwise commiserate about moms I'm here."]}
