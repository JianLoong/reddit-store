As a mother I cannot imagine trying to clip my child\u2019s wings like this. She needs to take her feelings to therapy, to her support system, instead of dumping them all on you.

Dorm life isn't even permanent, you'll return home the summer unless you end up staying with your sister or some friends between sessions when the dorms are closed.\n\nDon't let your mother's anxiety hold you back, if she's the type of person you can have a conversation about it with these are some good points to bring up.

But the bitter should be outweighed by the sweet, by the happiness and pride you feel at seeing your kid grow, mature and go off to lead the life they want to lead. I\u2019m speaking from experience. Of course I missed my kid when they went off to college, but I wanted them to go because it was the right thing for them. They loved it and I was very happy about that. \n\nNot only is your mother being run of the mill selfish by prioritizing her sadness over your eagerness for college and the start of an adult life, but her overprotectiveness is pathological.

She was stricter with me by my sister had the same \"Rules\"", "No offense, but the elder women in your family are really toxic. Your mother for being so controlling, which is what she was being even if it's motivated by protectiveness, and your grandmother for scolding you over wanting some damn independence. You have every right to wish to move out and attend school abroad if that's what you want, and neither your mother nor your grandmother are entitled to any say in the matter.\n\nBTW, given I can only assume you've been kept from learning most life skills there are oodles of youtube videos and internet resources for everything from laundry to cooking.\n\nNTA", "NTA - at what point in your life do you become an adult? At what age do you spread your wings and stop living accorind to your mothers needs?\n\nstop coming home on weekends to please your mother?  You are going to college to being YOUR life!\n\nShe didn't want you to have a job but she does want you to spend days travelling to visit her every weekend like you're in primary school?\n\nYour mother needs therapy and to learn that its not your role any more to fill whatever part of her is empty.  She needs a life of her own.", "NTA this is your mom's issue. It is normal to have sad feelings about the empty nest, but not normal to try to hold your child back from life.", "Going away to college is the perfect time to begin to put up boundaries for your mother. It won\u2019t be easy but this is the best time to do it. Don\u2019t put it off until later. Decide what limits are reasonable. Call twice a week, come home for a weekend once a month, for example. \n\nHaving been a college teacher for a few decades, I\u2019ve seen this problem first hand.\nCritical first steps are to have a completely independent bank account and credit card and give her no access. Under no condition give her access so that she can access your grades. Don\u2019t tell her the names of your teachers or I guarantee she will call them. When she oversteps boundaries, give her a time out and make sure she knows the connection between your absence and what she did.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward problem to solve but it will be ugly for a time and do not give in or you will be a divorced forty year old whose wife  left you solely because she could no longer stomach her MIL\u2019s intrusions. \n\nIf it gets bad, talk to a school counsellor. They are free for students to use and they will have lots of good support and advice for how to navigate this all too common problems for college aged students. \n\nGood luck! Your freedom is just around the corner.", "This exactly what will happen if OP doesn\u2019t take control of his life on the day he leaves for college.", "Yeah,NTA, she\u2019s being to over protective and should be more open and just accept it", "Absolutely NTA. Your mother is trying to use you like a living teddy bear to cling to instead of treating you like a human being. You absolutely 100% need to move out and should not come home every weekend. That is a ridiculous request.\n\nI understand what you're going through because my mom was very similar. Mine was nearly suicidal when I left for college. It took years for her to adjust. Your mom's feelings are not your fault. She is an adult and refusing to act like one. She is behaving like a toddler who doesn't want their favorite comfort toy taken away. You are not her toy. You are not an emotional support animal. You are a human who needs to begin her adult life in this world.\n\nIt's hard. I know. Unless you are willing and able to go NC, you'll have to constantly deal with this kind of emotional manipulation and abuse. It helped me a lot to finally articulate that what I'd been through was borderline abusive. I don't want to detract from people who've gone through so much more, but to admit that about my own experience helped. And that manipulation makes the manipulator absolutely someone you can't depend on when you need someone, so it's doubly isolating.\n\nSo I recommend you find good friends. Good, supportive, drama-free friends and relatives who will have your back and support you and who can be a sounding board whenever your mom's manipulating you again so you can ask, \"hey, does this sound reasonable?\"\n\nStay strong and good luck.", "NTA.

And for God's sake dont tell her this until your about to leave.", "Definitely not. I had to teach a girl on my floor how to do laundry the one weekend she didn't go home.

(They also offer dietary modifications for the major allergies, plus vegan/vegetarian on their website.)\n\nThat might be a good option for you to help you learn to cook on your own.

Make your boundaries and don't let her cross them.

Be smart and stay safe and best wishes.", "NTA.  Cut the cord now or she'll expect to go on your honeymoon with you and demand that you and your spouse move in with her.  Really, create the space now because no one needs to deal with \"(s)mother love\" like this.  Your sister lives near your chosen school, so you won't be alone.  You haven't chosen this school because it's a party school.  You've chosen it because it's best for your major and you got a scholarship.  You're making wise choices.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Do NOT go home every weekend.  Tell her you need to study.  Tell her you have a group project to work on.  Tell her whatever but don't go home every weekend.  Give her one weekend a month.  There are a lot of people who go home for Thanksgiving and Christmas break only.  \n\nYour mom has known for 18 years that this day was coming.  I know it's tough, but she's going to have to get used to the \"empty nest\" sooner or later.  It's not going to get any easier.", "NTA. I did the same thing you did. My mom was overbearing and couldn\u2019t handle the fact that I had my own life to live without her. My mother acted like I wasn\u2019t going to actually move out even though I accepted my accommodations on campus and even got a loan to be able to leave. She made fun of me for wanting to leave and called me ungrateful for not wanting to stay with her and take care of my family. \n\nYou will be hearing a lot negative comments until you leave if your mother is like mine. Don\u2019t believe them, don\u2019t doubt yourself. You have so much to learn and so much to do. Learning to be your own person does not mean you are abandoning your family. Your whole life is ahead of you and you can make it anything you want it to be. I moved out and now my mother has acknowledged that I am my own person, but it wasn\u2019t easy for her to realize it. \n\nYour mother may be angry, may ignore you at times, and may try to shame you but I have hope she will come around and recognize you are a person just trying to figure out what they want in life. My mom was awful and even she came to her senses. \n\nYOU GOT THIS! I believe in you <3", "NTA. At some point, you are going to have to fly free and the sooner you do, the easier it will be in the long run.

She\u2019s not thinking of you at all. Parents who never let their kids grow up are only setting them up for utter failure. I know breaking free, especially from such tight iron bars you are under, is scary as hell but that\u2019s ok. Every step you take forward will get easier. You will find supportive people and friends. You totally got this! College is the perfect place to learn because there will be other kids who are just as scared and clueless but you\u2019ll all figure it out. Shoot, if you got questions, PM me. I will happily help. In the meantime, do not give up on your plans. Do not ever stop going forward. Good luck and stay strong.", "Nta. Get away fast. Your mother needs to realize you are grown up.  I also suggest you get a job at school and find a summer apartment so you don't have to move back.

I bet they'll help you understand your mom better.\n\nIf you need to tell her you'll come home every weekend in order to not have her sabotage you leaving for college, do it.  I'm normally a big proponent of honesty, but your mom is being emotionally abusive. So you do what you have to in order to get out of that house and build a life for yourself.\n\nOnce you're settled at school let her know that you have weekend commitments.   There's a study group for your math class, a meeting of Engineers Without Borders or some other impressive sounding club relevant to your major, etc.   If you're still financially dependent on her during college you may need to balance this and find a way to go home once a month so she doesn't cut you off.\n\nCheck out the mental health services at the college.  Most of them offer a few one on one sessions and also have support groups moderated by psychologists.  They might have one for \"Students with Helicopter Parents\" or something like that.\n\nDon't sign any papers giving her access to information about you.  Specifically, don't sign a FERPA release.  Most students don't, and most schools and professors are very good at not releasing any information to parents who call. \n\nDon't give her any of your passwords.  Or if you already have, change then the first week of college and tell her that they gave all incoming freshman a lecture about not sharing passwords and that you can get in big trouble if the IT department sees that someone else logged in as you.\n\nGive her structured contact at first: you'll text her at least once a day so she knows you're okay, and you'll call every week.  That's a very reasonable level, and if she knows when she'll hear from you she's less likely to do something crazy.\n\nI love my kids and would be thrilled to see more of them.  But the fact that they're so busy with classes and friends at college and are handling most things well on their own and don't need to call me for help means I've done my job as a mother well.  I've raised kids who are becoming independent, successful adults.\n\nI'm sorry your mom doesn't take this view.  It's great that you're preparing now for what you need to learn in order to make it on your own.\n\nCheck out r/personalfinance if you haven't already.

Your t-shirts will come out grey (my brother learned this the hard way).\n\n2)  Don't wash a red sock with white jockey shorts.  Your underwear will come out pink and your gym buddies will really rag on you about this (again, my brother).\n\n3)  Be sure to clean out your pants pockets before putting them in the washer.  The washer will eat change and anything else left in the pockets (my father, this time).\n\n4)  Buy extra clothes in case of emergency.  Dorm/apartment complex laundry rooms don't have a bunch of washers and there are usually at least one or two out of service (I learned this when I leased my first apartment).\n\n5)  Buy multi-packs of socks all in the same color/style (example:  all white tube socks, all black ankle socks, etc.)  That way, when the washer eats one, you can just hang on to the remaining one so the next time it eats a sock (and it will), you can pair up the two odd socks and still have a complete pair (again, me).

I sense you are wise enough to know this already, but what the heck, I figured I'd just throw it in to give you a good even number of tips.", "Set a custom ringtone on your mom's contact. Select \"silent\" as the ringtone.  If you look at your phone you can see the notifications, but at least you'll be spared the constant noise.", "When in doubt, wash your stuff in cold. Don't overload the washer (your stuff won't get clean). Use low heat for more delicate stuff. Don't put white clothes in with bold colors, especially something like new jeans (they bleed their dye the first few washes!). Don't forget the dryer sheets.\n\n\n\nAnd NTA, going away to college isn't abandoning your family, it's you taking your first steps to be independent. Good luck!", "You're growing up in the era of the Internet.  You can definitely find a YouTube video or just hit  WikiHow and find a great tutorial on how to do laundry.  \n\nTips for college laundry:\n\n- Get detergent sheets like Tru Earth or pods like Tide Pods.  Then you can just carry as much detergent as you need down to the washers and not have to lug a big heavy bottle of liquid detergent.\n\n- Get a backpack style laundry basket.  It makes it much easier to carry your stuff from your dorm room to the laundry room.\n\n- Get 2 sets of sheets so you can change your bed completely and then wash the dirty sheets when you're washing your clothes.  Your class schedule may not work for stripping your bed, washing and drying your sheets, then making your bed all in the same day.\n\n- Decide on a weekly laundry time and put it on your calendar.  It's a lot easier to do laundry when you keep up with it rather than letting it overwhelm you, so start with the weekly routine right away.\n\n- Get a laundry buddy or two: meet up in the laundry room each week and you'll have someone to chat or study with while your clothes are going.  And if one of you needs to step out the other can watch their machines and keep the clothes moving.", "I don\u2019t know if anyone mentioned this channel yet but [Dad how do I](https://youtube.com/@DadhowdoI) is an excellent channel with how to videos from basic tasks to more complex.", "Scrambled eggs are easy.

You're an adult, which means they're generally not allowed to give information to parents. They may even tell her off if she tries it too often. \n\nGet a job on campus, put money away, and if you can, intern. Choose internships in fields you're interested in, even if you're not sure it's what you want to do. Getting a decent job is about who you know, not what you know; build a network now, so you can get on your feet more easily after you graduate.
