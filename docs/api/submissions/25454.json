{"id": 25454, "submission_id": "160exxf", "title": "WIBTA if I asked my dad for wedding money after he made my worse-off mom pay for their wedding because \"the bride's family pays\"?", "selftext": "Apologies for spelling/ formatting, I'm on my phone. \n\nI (F29) and my fiance (M27) recently got engaged and are looking into planning the wedding now. We are going through this planning with the mentality that the cost will be 100% on us. Together, we make decent-ish money and we are looking to do a low-cost wedding. His family might help out because they are very sweet, but we are not counting on it. \nMy parents haven't said anything and I'm wondering if I would be the asshole if I went out and asked my dad directly if he would be funding any portion of the wedding. I typically would not be this direct and ask about money when it hasn't been offered, but there's some history behind it. \n\nMy dad has always been the more affluent person in my parents' relationship by a HUGE margin, yet he is one of the stingiest people I know. He brags all the time about being a millionaire and how much he makes in the stock market and how everyone else should follow his lead, but he only gives my mom (who is now disabled and struggles to work)  less than $200 a month and he makes her pay for the phone bill and other things from it, even though he promised her that he would give her $500 a WEEK before she quit her job and moved to a different state with him. He will use finances as a way to exact control over whoever he can, for arbitrary reasons (for example, he told me that he would no longer help me with college if I didn't lose weight and keep my apartment room clean, even though he didn't live there). When I was house-shopping, he threatened to buy the house that I wanted (even though I specifically did NOT want him to do that) and stated that he would change the terms and conditions of the loan in order to \"help me and teach me a lesson\" and when I turned down his generous offer, he told me that he would no longer give me advice on home-buying and wouldn't allow my mother or grandmother to come help as well (they struggle driving by themselves). Suffice to say, he has money, but he is a jerk.\n\nNow here's why I might be the asshole. I want to ask him if he will donate any money to the wedding because of his past behavior. For his and my mom's wedding, even though he was way more well off than my mom, he made her family pay for the whole thing because, in his words, \"the bride's family pays for the wedding\", so they had to scrouge up the money for it while he didn't help. Well now, I'm the bride. I want to see if he'll actually stick to his words now that the shoe is on the other foot. \n\nKeep in mind, this is less of a \"I need money for the wedding\" and more of a \"put your money where your mouth is\". I don't expect money from anyone and my fiance and I are equipped to handle this thing on our own. If he even offers to give us any money, we're going to make sure we have it in hand before including it in the budget, just to make sure he can't renege on his promise.", "created_utc": 1692912842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160exxf/wibta_if_i_asked_my_dad_for_wedding_money_after/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or things like - \"I don't think a man who gives his wife only 200$ and makes her pay his bills out of that has a lot of money.
