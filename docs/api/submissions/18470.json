He\u2018s so rude to her\u2026 it hurts me a lot:( But she is always ready to forgive. He ignored her for 6 months didn\u2019t talk at all and treated her like actual dogshit. I wish he would apologize FOR ONCE.", "He never will.  She was probably raised by her parents to believe he was better than her and she just had to put up with whatever bad behavior he exhibits.  There's a small possibility that he will eventually cross the wrong line and she will stop accepting it, but unfortunately, it seems it will take more hurt for her to decide enough is enough."]}
