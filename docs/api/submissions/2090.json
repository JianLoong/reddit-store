{"id": 2090, "submission_id": "ysr9yv", "title": "AITA for not apologizing for leaving home when I turned 18?", "selftext": "Throwaway because reasons. I (30's) have a decent life. I have a loving SO and I wouldn't trade them for the world, nor my kids. The way I got to where I am now was not fun, though. I'll spare the exact details, but essentially I did not have a childhood, and I will never look back on my early years with any sort of fondness. I am and always will be NC with my mother because she is the single most toxic person on the face of this earth and she blames me for her life being in shambles right now (it's her fault, I had nothing to do with that). My father was an alcoholic because of her, and initially did nothing to stop the abuse (not physical), but when he finally grew a pair and separated from her, she made his life hell. He won in the end but it took a toll. He's not in the best of health and is currently living with me and my SO, and, like many old men his age, refuses to sit around and not help around the house. He refuses to believe he can't do things like he used to, which has resulted in a few trips to the hospital. My siblings come and visit him and my family often because they love him, just as I do. Before anyone says I should blame him just as much, just pack it away. That is in the past and he regrets it. Nothing I can say will ever hurt him more than his own guilt over not protecting us. He's grown a nice shiny spine since then and uses it to spoil his grandkids rotten. \n\n\nOn to the issue. While my siblings generally don't bring things up from our childhood, two nights ago we had a part when my dad took the kids to Cici's. This of course involved alcohol. Later in the evening, my siblings remarked that they did resent me for ducking out the second I turned 18. I'll be blunt and say yes, I did. I ran the second I could. I \"stole\" money from my mother (which she had originally stolen from me) and hid it in a false back to the air intake to the central AC unit for as long as I could, then ran without notice the second I was 18. I won't explain how I made it, as that will put this over the character limit. I went totally NC with my family and built my life. Why? As the oldest, my mother put everything on me and berated me for everything she failed to do. If the power got cut, it was my fault. If the roof sprung a leak, it was my fault. It was horrible. So I left. I didn't call CPS, mainly because I thought my mother just hated me. I found out later that when I left, Mother lost her abuse target, and turned to my oldest sister, then to my brother. By the time that my brother was 17, Dad got custody and Mom was cut out. My siblings drunkenly accused me of not caring for them then, and I, equally inebriated, shouted back that I had to leave for my own sanity. The night ended with everyone angry at each other, and I can't help but feel I hurt them by saying I had to. I don't regret leaving, not one bit. I regret that I didn't and couldn't help them.

Your mom is clearly the major asshole here, but sorry dude, it was your dad's job to protect you from her. She didn't turn him into an alcoholic. He was a grown-ass man and made his own choices. I'm glad he's good to your kids and that you now have a loving relationship, but your sibs shouldn't be blaming you for not doing your parents' job. You were drowning and you saved yourself. It probably felt like abandonment to your sibs, since you (just a KID for God's sake) were the only one functioning as an adult in the house. I'm so sorry for all you've gone through. I'll bet you're a great parent.", "Nta. Everyone got a little liquid courage and vented. They maybe were/are mad or jealous you got out but I think you can all move past it.", "NTA- I would just say it like this... I'm not sorry for leaving, but I am sorry for leaving you. It was pure survival for me and I was just a kid who was a wreck. I am sorry for all the things that Mom did but if you're trying to hold me accountable for what she did, then you're no better than she was because that was her go-to move and I left because I wouldn't take it from her, and I'm not going to take it now. I hate just about everything about all our childhood but do not think to point it at me because that is not something that I can or will accept and I will resent the fuck out of the attempt.", "NTA\n\nYou were a teenager!

Good for you for beating the odds and creating a wonderful life for yourself. \n\n\u2022I can see your siblings perspective too as they probably looked up to you and felt abandoned and unloved when you left. \n\n\u2022Perhaps take the time and hear them out about how they felt when you left , and hopefully in turn they can hear you out on why you had to leave.

They need to shift that resentment over to your father because he was their parent. You weren\u2019t. Your only responsibility was to yourself and you did the right thing getting yourself out.", "NTA  but neither are your siblings, all of you survived a horrible childhood, the after effects can be just as devastating. You and your siblings might benefit from family counseling - your terrible childhoods will not be resolved in a drunken argument when long held grievances and alcohol are involved. I've been in the same situation and everyone can have a different experience. My heart goes out to all of you, I hope you can resolve this and move on\n Unfortunately my siblings and I never could, it's one of my deepest regrets.", "NTA. If anything they should be great full that you were there shielding them for as long as you were.", "NTA - I'm curious, at what ages did the rest of the siblings move out?  Did your sister stay after 18 or did she exit as well.", "NAH\n\nHonestly above reddit's paygrade and it sounds like you all could benefit from therapy. Obviously your parents are both the true assholes, but sad as it is to say, your siblings' resentment is very common.\n\nEither you were the one thing keeping them from receiving the brunt of the abuse by acting as a target while you were still around and it fell to the next in line after you left, or you were the closest thing to an adult who understood your mother's abuse and acted against it so they feel you should have done more for them instead of yourself. Blaming your parents doesn't make them feel any better because you all grew up with them failing you.\n\nIt's a common feeling amongst younger siblings in abused families, but not reasonable. You were not wrong to leave because they were not your responsibility, there was nothing you could have done, and you had the right to protect yourself, but like I said, sounds like talking to a professional would be best to help them deal with those feelings.\n\nYou've obviously forgiven your father for his part in enabling your mother, so try not to hold your siblings' resentment against them either. Don't take the blame, but don't hold it against them. You were all victims.", "NTA. You did the only thing you could do.", "NTA \n\nI am sorry for what you and your family went through OP. I agree with comments above that you were just 18 and you could only save yourself at the moment. You also had it the worst as you were one of the primary caregivers of the home. You can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. \n\nHave your siblings and you done individual and/or family therapy/counselling  to work through the issues regarding your abusive mother? \n\nThey blame you, but they need to look at the facts. You were just a kid yourself and had no way of predicting what they were going to go through after you left. \n\nAlcohol exacerbated this conversation, but maybe a mediator/therapist or family meeting will help all of you establish some facts and accept and reiterate some of the issues you all went through for what they were (not what they perceived they were due to their youth).", "NAH. They have their own perspective, and likely not talking about it for so long it's like WTF? It might be good for everyone to share and let go, a closure type of thing, but not always the best thing to do. And how nice you take care of your dad!!!", "This...so much this... \n\nYour siblings are missing the part where your own father couldn't  protect them, how could you? It's still putting responsibility on you and negating what you went through. I don't think it's done with any sort of malice, just a lot of trauma.", "He didn't divorce her originally because of religious and financial reasons. He doesn't talk about it much, but I think it was because of insurance and the fact that he would have faced major familial issues (which he did in the end, but it was mitigated due to evidence he had). Drinking was how he coped. He was not and never has been a bad drunk. Mainly sleepy and passive. I'm not angry that you're pointing out what you see as fault in my father, but he was drowning just as much as I was. I never saw her going after him directly but I wouldn't be surprised if she did. Thank you so much for your support, it means a lot. Bless you, wherever you are.", "I agree that the siblings need to talk, but this needs to be done with the support of a licensed family therapist. It would not be fair to OP to open him up to his siblings just piling their anger on him/her for getting out", "If OPs siblings are only focusing on their pain, I believe their intent was malicious. They're not holding a grudge against the pain that they watched OP endure.\n\nOP was victimized by everyone in that house who was comforted by OP taking the abuse. They depended on OP to suffer alone and continue taking it, so they wouldn't have to. They tried to inflict guilt upon their protector who suffered for 18yrs.", "I mean, yes maybe he was drowning as much as you were but he had a responsibility you didn\u2019t have, to be a good parent to his children. That was never your burden to bare and you should not be shouldering blame now for taking yourself out of that situation.", "You deserve support! Hats off to those who take life's lemons and make lemonade. Thanks for the blessing, and backatcha."]}
