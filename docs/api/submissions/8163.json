Our delivery service never came yesterday so we had no food to give to these kids and I spent 30 minutes just searching various pantries around the site to make sure I could serve enough food so every child could come back not only for seconds but thirds, just as they usually do. Fortunately there was enough but it was a pretty stressful situation that took much more energy out of me than I wanted it to. But at least the kids ate.\n\nThen home time comes around and I'm half an hour overtime which I try to make sure never happens and my coordinator is in a rush to leave. As I'm walking over to my busstop to go home, I realise I made the stupid mistake of leaving my wallet and bus card in our staff office and I didn't have the keys to get them back. My coordinator and I are also always the very last people to leave on the site, so there was no way I was getting home by bus like I planned. \n\nMy work is about five minutes from my mum's (F54)  house, so I called her and asked if she was available to pick me up. She said she was, but I would have to wait, as she was coming home from the nearby hospital with my brother since he had his surgery today. I don't speak to my brother, so I forgot about this and felt bad, but mum told me as long as I was okay with waiting, she could swing past, which I was very grateful for and made sure to tell her. \n\nI wait. Mum arrives. I thank her again and apologise. We go home. I help her clean and wash the car because I was bored. We have dinner together. I go to have a shower. Then, as I'm tired, I tell mum that I'm heading to bed early.\n\nAs SOON as the words \"I'm tired\" leave my mouth my mother starts by going \"Don't you dare say your tired, after the day I've had, I'm the only one in this house who should be tired. I've cleaned and driven your brother to the hospital and now after 10 hours I'm finally sitting down. Don't you dare say \"you're\" tired.\"\n\nConfused, calmly and roughly verbatim, I said \"Mum, why does everything have to be a competition with you? You worked hard, you're tired. I know. I'm not saying you're not. I'm just saying I am too. I worked hard today in my own way, so I am also tired. We can both be tired and that's okay.\" My mum grunts and so I walk off and go to bed.\n\nAfter two hours, I woke up from thirst and went to get some water and saw mum was still up. However, she wasn't looking at me and just kept pretending like I wasn't there and was being very obvious about it. I asked her why is she upset and she told me she's sick of the way I treat her.\n\nI didn't mean to appear disrespectful or ungrateful when I spoke to her.

Your mom needs to grow up.", "NTA. You're right that it doesn't have to be a competition and of course you must both be tired. Sounds like your mum has her own issues to work through (as do we all) - I'd stay aware of those issues, and maybe in the future phrase it like \"what a day, you must be exhausted and so am I, let's go to bed\", but it sounds like you two have a good relationship otherwise so I wouldn't worry too much.\n\nEDIT: Just on rereading this, it sounds like your mum was just about to say she was tired to try and garner some sympathy, and you said it first which made her feel she couldn't get sympathy from you, so she was pissed off about that, but it expressed itself in a strange way. I'd say she acted like an AH but after all she was tired and things do slip out weirdly when we're tired!", "NTA.\n\nYour mother seems to be very self-absorbed and insensitive.\n\nJust because she is tired or has it worse in her opinion, doesn\u2019t mean that you can be tired and feel your feelings as well.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be a competition, and especially parents shouldn\u2019t do this to their child. She has no right to invalidate and minimize your very real & valid struggles.", "NTA and your mom is weirdly competitive. Is this normal or do you think maybe it was just stress from the hospital/surgery situation?", "NTA - your moms feelings do not negate all other feelings. You\u2019d probably have a lot of success treating her like the kids you work with during the day", "NTA your mom doesn't have a monopoly on exhaustion.", "NTA but it seems like moving out and going low or no contact is in your future. Also maybe going to subs for kids of narcs cause your mom sounds toxic AF and the nosey Nancy in me wonders what the story behind your relationship with your brother is. My hypothesis is something like he is the golden child that your mom spoils the shit out of and now he's an entitled ah, but that's just me projecting.", "Nah, she was pissed at being called out on her behavior and can't possibly apologize.\n\nNTA", "I do t think what you posted was disrespectful but they way you\u2019ve posted it/or how I read it was more of a Snow White reply. It was sweet and kind. I have a feeling it was more of a grumbled Gargamel voice where you were angry and frustrated that you weren\u2019t allowed to be tired. The reality is sometimes the tone is more indicative of behavior/emotions than the actual words.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were respectful and just trying to take care of yourself.", "NTA. I have this experience with a family member where it\u2019s impossible to have as hard of a day or be as tired as they are. It is really dismissive and rude.", "NTA", "NTA. She sounds like one of those people who always has to make things a competition which she has to win. Nobody else is allowed to work harder than her and claiming otherwise makes her huffy.", "Is your mom really an adult?", "NTA, I can\u2019t stand it when you tell someone you\u2019re tired or in pain and they turn it into a tired competition. What do you do with that? See who falls asleep faster to see who wins?", "I agree. On the plus side at least OP is used to dealing with toddler tantrums. NTA.", "And she also needs to realise the OP is an adult who works hard too. It's not just her who has hard work in their lives.", "Thank you for this! I don't think my mother was being an AH intentionally because I also know how tired she was, but I just needed to hear that what I said wasn't completely unreasonable either. And on second thought, knowing my mum, the sympathy thing is 100% likely, so I'll definitely be keeping that in mind for the future. Thank you!", "My mother has always been a somewhat manipulative person when she begins to feel neglected or drained. So I always try to use my words to let her know that I do truly care. There are also times where she still sees me as an extension of herself, so there are other times where I distance myself either emotionally or physically to cope. It's just one of those things you learn to live with after all these years.  She hasn't acted out like this to me in a few months, but it's not foreign by any means. Fortunately my brother didn't have major surgery, but I think it still definitely stressed her out as a mother nonetheless. So in all, definitely a mix. Thank you for the consideration :)", "I understand what you're saying. But I was very careful of my tone because my mum has always been quite sensitive to these things, and working with kids, it becomes second nature to watch your tone as well. I wish I spoke in a Gargamel voice however. That probably would have made us both laugh.\n\nEDIT: actually, now that I think about it. Maybe because I was so careful of my tone I came off as condescending or patronising to my mum. I'll definitely have to think over that. Thank you!"]}
