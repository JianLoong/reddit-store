We are like brother and sister but have some pretty epic arguments though and have fallen out so much over the years - the last time, we didn't talk for years. She was engaged to my late best friend who died 14 years ago.\n\nI've recently discovered I have rare form of cancer - I could fight it if I have a drastic surgery that would really change my anatomy and would probably mean zero chance of ever meeting someone to spend my life with. So I'm deciding to not have the surgery and let nature take its course and I'll get palliative care instead. \n\nShe's one of the only people outside my family who knows so I told her. She asked me what the prognosis is and I told her. She said I was being ridiculous and she wants me to fight it. I told her no and to drop it. She asked if I was going to tell L. I said no, don't dare. \n\nNow years ago, I was raising a boy, I call L (now 18) who I thought I was the dad of and was actively in his life until I found out I wasn't his dad. When we discovered that I wasn't, he found his real dad and got closer to him and eventually he asked if L could be his legal and permanent dad - I agreed, and eventually he decided he didn't want me in his life so he stopped contact. \n\nSo I was minding my own business yesterday and I get a message on my social media from L. Basically, my friend reached out to him and told him my plans. He was saying to not be stupid, have the treatment, he'll get in contact again and will build a relationship up - anything just don't give up. I told him it's too late. \n\nI called my friend and was furious. Really ripped her a new one. I told her this time, we really are done. She was begging me for another chance and she doesn't want to lose me too. I told her too late, and she better not come to my funeral and I'll haunt her if she does. And I'll make specific plans with the funeral director she's not to come. \n\nI don't know whether I'm being too harsh but what she's done haunts me no end.

You\u2019ve made your choice about treatment, but please consider that L is still a kid and probably is starting to realize how important you are to them. they will still be here when you\u2019ve gone. Spend some time with him now to let him know you still love him", "NTA, no one here is. You're depressed, understandably. You mention that if you fight the cancer, you'd be changing your anatomy to the point that you'd never find someone to spend your life with... so you may as well let the cancer take your life? That's the depression talking. \n\nYou'd be surprised to find that there are people out there who can become that person in your life despite whatever physical change you're going to go through. \n\nAnyone who would reject you based on whatever physical changes you go through are not worth your time. \n\nIt's totally your choice, but if it were me, I'd fight the cancer and give myself time to figure out the rest of my life.", "I find it hard to believe that this is the worst thing you\u2019ve ever said to her.

Just add this one to the book of epics.  \n\nNTA but neither is she.  You know, medical directives are quite personal.  But since you put it out here on this forum, I have to say that ending it all because you \u201csuspect\u201d no one will want to spend their life with you based on the physical impact of a  life saving surgery- well that\u2019s just presumptuous and short-sighted.  And it also throws immense disrespect to those in your life who already love you.", "I offer no judgment at all.  I wish you prayers and peace on your journey whether you choose seek treatment or let nature take its course.", "NAH \u2013 I\u2019m sorry for your diagnosis. And I\u2019m sorry that your friend was such a massive asshole in ignoring your wishes on what is presumably a sensitive issue even at the best of times (by which I mean without taking your diagnosis into account). So, why didn\u2019t I go for NTA? Three reasons:\n\n(1) In matters of life or death, the standard required to be an asshole is higher.\n\n(2) I\u2019m assuming your friend was motivated by the value they place on a 29 year relationship, by their fear of losing you after already losing their fiancee, and by wanting to \u2018help you\u2019 \u2013 I bet it\u2019s all too easy to think \u2018my friend will change their mind about staying alive if I can just find the correct thing to say or do\u2019.\n\n(3) Banning your friend from your funeral is a drastic response. Sure, telling her that you\u2019ll do it is entirely justified, but following through on it will, as you say, be harsh. That doesn\u2019t mean it would be too harsh. It\u2019s your funeral. But I\u2019ve always thought that funerals are for the living, not the dead. If you can\u2019t forgive her in life, maybe you can countenance doing so in death?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, having read the comments, you\u2019re flat wrong that the surgery would mean never finding anyone to spend your life with.

Painful unrelenting disfiguring reality. \n\nYour body, your spirit, your choice.\n\nNTA and a giant FU to people who say to fight and or  pray. Cuz if you don't do enough of those things you are a loser or not worthy enough?? Nope.\n\nPeace be the journey", "NTA. I am not sure why people often believe their opinion is more important than any life decisions already made by those affected by it. Your friend's complete disregard for your wishes (pushing you to have surgery, sharing info with L after being asked not to) at a difficult time like this is pretty entitled. It is up to you whether or not to forgive, but you know you at least got your point across. I am sorry this is happening to you. Wishing you the best.", "NTA. She crossed an extreme line.\n\nMay I ask what the change will be? People who are missing limbs or that have other physical disabilities live full and fulfilling lives, ones that include marriage and children.\n\nYour care is your choice. However, the idea that becoming physically disabled means you will absolutely never have a partner doesn\u2019t sit well with me because it isn\u2019t true.", "NTA\n\nSharing medical information against someone's will is extremely unethical and huge breach of trust. Your friend is the AH.\n\nNow 18 year old should be burdened by something like that.\n\nEven if someone doesn't agree with your decision, they should respect it.", "NTA. Yes, she overstepped her boundries, but I just don't think she meant it maliciously and thought she was helping. I will give her a very soft TA rating. Its your decision if you want to reconsile with her or not. It's your life, however much you have left. \n\nL, on the other hand, is more of a TA. I just can't stand anyone who cuts contact and then, one that person is on their deathbed, all of a sudden starts caring. That annoys me the most.", "Not the asshole.

I won't go into details but we have both said some pretty harsh things to each other. Neither one of us is innocent there. \n\nI'm being honest about my own limitations as I know there aren't a lot of women that would want a man who won't be able to provide much in the way of physical intimacy. And I wouldn't want that sort of life either - would be really embarrassing. People who know me would know how harsh asking me to live like that would be.", "I am fully aware of what you speak. I have considered taking a trip there to Switzerland before things get too bad.", "I'll lose my penis. Total penectomy.", "Sorry I don't believe in God.", "Your pain is tangible. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.", "Sex isn\u2019t just dick and vagina. You can have amazing oral sex , use sex toys \ud83e\uddf8, erotic aromatic things , role playing .

YMMV.", "That would prevent you from having kids (though you could have your semen frozen) but there are MANY women who wouldn't dump you for that. A relationship is more than PIV sex. There are other ways to enjoy each other. ETA: It is still your choice, though.", "Losing your penis does not mean you are guaranteed to die alone. \n\nIt would mean you are still mentally able to connect with a partner, still able to do many activities and participate in life, and it would mean you still have other ways to give and receive intimate pleasure. You still can provide multiple things people look for in a lifelong partner, and there are people with your condition who find their person after the surgery.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say it doesn\u2019t create challenges when it comes to finding someone but those challenges aren\u2019t automatically insurmountable. They *feel* insurmountable, but the reason for that is not based on facts.\n\nI strongly encourage you to find support groups with other people in your situation. When I went through my mastectomy it was a huge emotional comfort to know I wasn\u2019t alone, the hear the good and the bad from people who were much farther in the journey I was just starting. I promise - just because it\u2019s hard doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all bad.\n\nAt the end of the day you still have to do what\u2019s right for you. However, you deserve a realistic picture of your possibilities.", "Not having vaginal sex can be a personal choice and is not inherently tied to masculinity or manliness. Here are a few reasons why someone might prefer not to engage in vaginal sex and how it does not define their masculinity:\n\n1. Diverse preferences: Sexual preferences and desires can vary greatly among individuals. Not engaging in vaginal sex does not diminish one's masculinity; it simply reflects personal preferences and comfort levels.\n\n2. Emotional connection: Intimacy and connection can be fostered in various ways beyond vaginal sex. Emotional closeness, communication, and other forms of physical intimacy can create a fulfilling and meaningful connection in a relationship.\n\n3. Mutual consent and respect: The decision to engage in any sexual activity, including vaginal sex, should always be based on mutual consent and respect. Respecting personal boundaries and choices is an essential aspect of healthy relationships and does not impact one's masculinity.\n\n4. Sexual diversity: There is a wide range of sexual activities and expressions that people find fulfilling and pleasurable. Masculinity is not determined by one's sexual activities but rather by the qualities, characteristics, and values that individuals embody.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's preferences and comfort levels are valid, and what matters most is engaging in consensual and respectful relationships that prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of all parties involved.", "And death is better?", "i'm not going to try to sway you one way or another but did you know there are phalloplasty and scrotoplasty surgeries where they can construct you a new set? the transmasculine community would have more information on them than I do, but modern phalloplasty can give you a penis that can maintain an erection. idk about actually ejaculating tho", "God is still with you \ud83d\udc9c it\u2019s kinda funny you don\u2019t believe in god but do believe in ghosts haunting \ud83d\udc7b heheh \n\nI think you might be feeling a bit depressed.

Which would be even tougher because I'd have a sex drive but 0 way of physical release.", "I'm well aware of ways I could explore intimacy and while I won't go into detail what I have in mind, the thought of having to go through that just to enjoy intimacy for the rest of my life feels embarrassing. \n\nSupport groups are very few and far between in my part of the UK.", "Yeah I know what you're saying but I am also thinking about my own pleasure too. I'd never be able to get off which would be just horrible to think about.", "Than that, yeah.", "Yes I do realise, however in my case I might not be able to have one for a while as my body will need to be cancer free before the surgeons would consider it.

I figure if it's my last, I'll enjoy it in style.", "Then this isn\u2019t about your surgery.

Your doctor should have some good suggestions, but even exploring Facebook groups can be a helpful resource as long as you do your due diligence.", "well... admittedly i'm asexual, so I can't say I understand the importance of being able to get off; it doesn't come up (lol) for me very often. There are other ways to get off, but if you're uncomfortable with them, that's your business. Seeking treatment or not is your prerogative, and if you're determined, then I wish you a relatively painless passing. i will say, the solutions modern medicine offers may be imperfect, but they're out there, and always improving. you can make tomorrow better than today, even in little ways, if you're here for it. you can't change your situation at all, if you're dead.", "Fantastic.

It is possible to have phalloplasty eventually but I personally don't see much point. For one, I'd have a permanent scar and weakness in my arm and the other, I'd never be able to get off much either. It'd be mainly cosmetic afaik.", "I'm definitely not asexual. I have a huge sex drive and couldn't do without it. Plus the sort of things you refer to to get off, grosses me out and I'm not ready for a lifetime of that sort of thing.", "I would bring it up at your next session. \n\nPlease also look into support groups.
