While we were eating dinner she kept jokingly flirting?\u2026 whenever my dad would leave the table she\u2019d ask questions like \u201cdo you think you\u2019d be able to lift me up?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m into quiet men you know\u201d \u201cdo you want my number\u201d while laughing. I just told bf to ignore her (texts under the table), My dad n jack were peacefully making conversation with bf. But then it got a bit out of hand, Sarah randomly made comments like \u201cspeak up\u201d or \u201cI wanna hear you talk louder come on\u201d while giggling like a little girl. In FRONT of my dad this time since bf wasn\u2019t really responding apart from an awkward laugh. She would even tap him with her legs under the table. My dad just told her to \u201cplease be quiet\u201d and she kept going on about how everyone\u2019s always so uptight\n\nWhen bf left I calmly said to Sarah \u201cdon\u2019t do that again please it was really embarrassing for me, and you were acting like a teenage girl\u201d she got really offended and then had a full blown argument, she ended up crying. I\u2019m talking full on sobbing almost like a tantrum. My dad was consoling her??.\n\nNow this is where Lisa comes in. So she went off at me, about how I\u2019m insensitive and how Sarah just has a \u201cflirty personality\u201d n that I should be grateful I have an upgrade from my abus*v* bio mother. That\u2019s when I lost it. I yelled at her, she STILL proceeded to make comments about how she understands my bio mum. Since we were kids she\u2019d always make comments about my abus*v* mother.\nI usually lose my temper at her so this time I just yelled at her to get away from me which she did. My dad is now very upset with me and is currently comforting Sarah and forcing me to make her a cup of tea, apologise to Lisa and go back to my place.\n\nAITA? Does she really have a flirty personality and did I overreact? And is it my fault that Lisa got upset about her mother and got annoyed at me?\n\nEdit: Lisa and Sarah do not live there, they\u2019ve been coming round since I was 15, and have always made nasty remarks to me and my brother.", "created_utc": 1667430387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykl08b/aita_for_making_my_dads_fianc\u00e9_cry/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad broke your boundaries by involving them. Sarah is a creep. Lisa shouldn\u2019t be commenting on your birth mom, that\u2019s not her business. Disgusting behavior from them.", "NTA. What a cringey thing for your future stepmom to do. A 37 year old woman should fully be able to understand how to not hit on your 19 y/o boyfriend. I also bet she could see how uncomfortable it was and is turning on the tears now.", "NTA, but WTF?!  A grown-ass woman getting flirty with a minor is gross.  I am a flirty person.  Guess what.  That shit can be controlled, ESPECIALLY when it comes to minors.  Sarah is acting predatory, and this is disgusting.  Keep your boyfriend away from her.  She\u2019s 100% the sort who\u2019d have an affair with a teen who didn\u2019t want it, then claim that a physiological response is proof he wanted it.

Let\u2019s just play along with that. It is INAPPROPRIATE for your future \u201cstep mom\u201d to be flirting with your boyfriend. It\u2019s INAPPROPRIATE for her to be flirting with a 19 yo in front of her soon to be husband. On no level is any of that appropriate!!! It\u2019s actually kinda disgusting. NTA.", "NTA. It's really easy to point to the \"what if the gender roles were reversed?\" thought experiment here. Your partner was invited into your home as a dinner guest and was made to feel uncomfortable by the \"flirty personality\" of an adult. Apparently your dad, Sarah, and Lisa are of the opinion that there was no problem with Sarah's behavior because she is a woman and your boyfriend is a man. Anyone who thinks that having a \"flirty personality\" is somehow a justifiable excuse for singling out a person in a vulnerable position and behaving in a way that makes that person feel awkward and uncomfortable is just a creep. \n\nI think the biggest asshole is your dad, though. Sure, he's your father, but you are an adult now and he doesn't have the right to tell you that people that he chose to be in *his* life are *your* family. This dinner was about you introducing your boyfriend to your actual family members, but **your dad ruined it.** First he invited Sarah and Lisa without telling you, then just allowed Sarah to make your boyfriend feel awkward after you already discussed his shyness with him, and then he took Sarah and Lisa's side instead of yours after they both disrespected you.", "NTA. The reason it looked like she was having a tantrum is that she was having a tantrum. Completely inappropriate", "NTA. Not even close to the asshole. I find it disgusting a grown woman her age is flirting with a teenager then trying to play ig off as a joke, no it\u2019s not. She is definitely attracted to him and wanted to see his reaction of her attempts to see if he\u2019s into it too. It\u2019s weird and disgusting. And the fact that your dad totally ignored your wishes and bring her anyway is unbelievable, not to mention he\u2019s mad at you instead of being mad at her for her inappropriate comments, yea no. I\u2019d never understood how parents can choose their significant other over their child. I\u2019d distance myself from them if I were you.", "NTA.  Your dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 should flirt with the person she\u2019s going to marry not guests in the house. Sarah is almost twice your BF\u2019s age, that\u2019s just gross. Your dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a bit weird and creepy and you should do the best you can to stay away. You\u2019re not responsible for Sarah\u2019s nasty actions.", "NTA.  Your father's girlfriend seems like one of those people who has to have constant male attention to feel like she has any worth.  It's very sad and her behavior is pathetic.  It sounds like her daughter was embarrassed and tried to get the discussion directed back to your mother.  Which is a coping mechanism, and not a good one.  You should not have to apologize for calling both of them out.", "NTA, because it sounds like she's a very inappropriate person.  She harassed your boyfriend.", "Nta \n\nI would have a serious talk with your dad because your dad's fiance and her daughter were so out of line", "NTA. \n\n    You have every right to feel how you feel. They were way out of line and you dad does nothing to discourage it.", "NTA, stay away from them!! Your poor boyfriend should not have to deal with unwanted advances from anyone, especially not from the \"family\" of his SO.

I have no words! Well, I have many, but none of them good.\n\nOp, I'm sorry you have been dealt such a terrible hand when it comes to parents. NC is your best option if it is possible.", "NTA\n\nFlirty personality!  Seriously?  For a 37 yr old to a 19 yr old?  Wow.\n\nShe has issues.\n\nI would not have made her tea, I would have walked out", "Her tantrum doesn't speak well for her level of maturity. From your description, I thought you were talking about the daughter. That is totally inappropriate for her to act that way with someone that much younger. Ask your father if it would be appropriate for him to flirt with Lisa.  How would Lisa like her flirting with her boyfriend? This is just all kinds of messed up. NTA", "Girlfriend\u2019s comments wete gross and inappropriate.  Don\u2019t worry though- if Dad called her out, he sees issues.  \n\nNTA.", "Sounds like Sarah must have been under the influence of crazy chemicals", "NTA - I have a very flirty personality but would never talk to someone's boyfriend like this. And she's a grown ass woman making it even more inappropriate. That's freaking weird. i would leave the house and not apologize. Tell your dad you are owed an apology and will not come back until you receive one. And keep your poor bf away from that woman. Hello Mrs. Robinson.", "NTA\n\nShe continued with her flirty behaviour after she had been asked to stop. It was inappropriate and she's an AH\n\nIn retrospect, perhaps you should have invited just your father and your brother to your place, where you would have more control over the situation.", "NTA\u2014-DO NOF APOLOGIZE AND DO NOT MAKE THAT WOMAN TEA. Tell your dad he\u2019s delusional and if he continues to let his little precious step daughter and wife to talk to you like that he won\u2019t be talking to you at all.", "NTA. She was creepy AF. She has a kid almost your and your boyfriend\u2019s age. I\u2019m 34 and the idea of knowingly flirting with a teenager makes me gag. The only thing you should\u2019ve done is walk out when she was there and/or invite your dad out or to your place. I would definitely recommend going no or low contact, if your dad doesn\u2019t respond well to a conversation about boundaries. \n\nAlso, is she creepy and gross toward your brother as well? Because I\u2019m honestly concerned that she doesn\u2019t have appropriate boundaries about how to act with kids. My mother\u2019s brother\u2019s now-wife was drunk and grinding with my youngest cousin at their wedding and that was almost a decade ago. We all still remember and we are all still grossed out and none of us would trust her to hold an appropriate boundary with a child. (And yes, a 19 year old, while not a minor, is still psychologically developing and a child, definitely compared to a 37 year old.)", "NTA\u2026and I wouldn\u2019t even make the tea.
