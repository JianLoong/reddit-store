{"id": 20887, "submission_id": "14m6j3b", "title": "AITA for being loud at a campsite with Boy Scout neighbors?", "selftext": "Hi, recently my friends and I went camping (6 of us total) We ended up being next to a group of Boy Scouts and their moms. As we are young men, I went up to them with one of my friends and told them to please talk to us if we were bothering them or too loud. The lead mom enthusiastically said sure thing and she would let us know. \n\nLater that night around 8:30 PM, we were sitting around the campfire and one of my friends was playing music on a speaker while we talking and drinking. The music on the speaker wasn\u2019t too loud but could probably be heard in their camp. A good thing to note is we are a diverse group of guys while the area we were in did not have much diversity. All of a sudden, a sheriff shows up to our campsite with his flashlight and said we are being a bit loud. He did explain that quiet time is at 10:00 and that we look like we are having a good time, so he just reminded us to stay quiet at 10 and left. \n\nMy friends and I were understandably upset, as it was clear the neighbors did not come to us first and called the sheriff. We then turned up the music when he left until 10:00 and retired to our tents. The next morning, the Boy Scouts and moms had cleared out when they had been planning to be there for our whole stay. \n\nWhile we did escalate a bit when the sheriff left, we thought it was very ignorant of them as we came to them first. We were also in a small town with a diverse crowd, so who knows what this sheriff could have done to us.\n\nEdit: since people don\u2019t seem to understand. Our campsite is away from the main loop of campers. The Boy Scouts were our ONLY neighbors. The sheriff would have had to park on the main loop and walk into our campsite. That and the Boy Scouts leaving lead us to conclude that the sheriff was called by them on us.", "created_utc": 1688049074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m6j3b/aita_for_being_loud_at_a_campsite_with_boy_scout/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They fired the first shot. You let them know they could speak with you if there were noise issues and they went straight to the cops instead. Nowadays, that's such a terrible idea.

The sheriff is a call away, and not everyone in that group is going to have disabilities.\n\nAlone, I get why you're saying. But as a group, if you're scared something might happen, then staying the night near them is more dangerous as all will be sleeping after a certain time.", "No, they were told they were being a little loud and that quiet hours were at 10. That means you turn it down a bit now, and then *off* at 10.", "Actually, the sheriff came by to tell them that they were a bit too loud, so not at an acceptable level. He was giving them a warning.", "The sheriff deemed it not to be an offense. \n\nThere are plenty of ways to be an asshole without breaking the law.", "That is the most blatant asshole behavior I've ever seen on this sub.", "You can listen to music, sure. If someone tells you it\u2019s too loud, you turn it down right then, and off when quiet hours start. OP doesn\u2019t seem to grok that the rangers wanted them to turn it down.", "300 yards is not that far. You had a fire, you had music, you were talking and drinking. The sheriff easily could have located your campsite from the road. He could have decided on his own that he should talk to you.", "My ex was with a group of his friends in a portage only site and still had park rangers come and check on them and make sure they weren't doing anything they weren't supposed to (it was a radio free zone and no cans allowed and they definitely checked)", "That could mean the sheriff could hear you when they were rounding and decided to stop in. Because you were too effing loud.", "Yta EVERYONE here agrees yta", "Depending on the state, park rangers sometimes carry guns. And uh\u2026they\u2019re kinda known for the big badges and hats.", "It\u2019s their literal job lol. Guess you don\u2019t camp much either. Whomever is in charge of patrolling the campground- Ranger, Park Security, Sheriff- will do a drive through around dinner time-8pm to check things and tell anyone being loud to quiet down. Absolutely not harassment.", "I think you missed the point. No one told them it was too loud - they probably would have turned it down if so. You don't just call the cops on someone if you think someone is playing music too loudly AFTER they say hey, if this is too loud just tell us.", "To be fair, some parks don\u2019t have rangers on patrol and it is the Sheriff that drives through.  But they often do a prelim drive through around 8pm to give warnings. I\u2019d bet this was just a drive through and no one called.", "I'll say in my state they eliminated the big hats and badges for ranger safety, and maybe to make them seem more approachable."]}
