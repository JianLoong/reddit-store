{"id": 20887, "submission_id": "14m6j3b", "title": "AITA for being loud at a campsite with Boy Scout neighbors?", "selftext": "Hi, recently my friends and I went camping (6 of us total) We ended up being next to a group of Boy Scouts and their moms. As we are young men, I went up to them with one of my friends and told them to please talk to us if we were bothering them or too loud. The lead mom enthusiastically said sure thing and she would let us know. \n\nLater that night around 8:30 PM, we were sitting around the campfire and one of my friends was playing music on a speaker while we talking and drinking. The music on the speaker wasn\u2019t too loud but could probably be heard in their camp. A good thing to note is we are a diverse group of guys while the area we were in did not have much diversity. All of a sudden, a sheriff shows up to our campsite with his flashlight and said we are being a bit loud. He did explain that quiet time is at 10:00 and that we look like we are having a good time, so he just reminded us to stay quiet at 10 and left. \n\nMy friends and I were understandably upset, as it was clear the neighbors did not come to us first and called the sheriff. We then turned up the music when he left until 10:00 and retired to our tents. The next morning, the Boy Scouts and moms had cleared out when they had been planning to be there for our whole stay. \n\nWhile we did escalate a bit when the sheriff left, we thought it was very ignorant of them as we came to them first. We were also in a small town with a diverse crowd, so who knows what this sheriff could have done to us.\n\nEdit: since people don\u2019t seem to understand. Our campsite is away from the main loop of campers. The Boy Scouts were our ONLY neighbors. The sheriff would have had to park on the main loop and walk into our campsite. That and the Boy Scouts leaving lead us to conclude that the sheriff was called by them on us.", "created_utc": 1688049074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m6j3b/aita_for_being_loud_at_a_campsite_with_boy_scout/", "score": 6436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They fired the first shot. You let them know they could speak with you if there were noise issues and they went straight to the cops instead. Nowadays, that's such a terrible idea.

If your music was so loud that your neighbours could hear you from their camp, if they were farther away and you still aren't sure if they COULD hear, chances are your music was way too loud. If the sheriff told you to keep it down and you turned it up in retaliation, that means the Boy Scouts were justified in going to the camp's security to tell you to keep it down. If you were that upset to retaliate against the authority figures who asked you to keep it down, it sounds like you could have been even MORE upset if the other camp asked you to keep it down. And especially since you were all drinking, if it was a lot of alcohol, you were very, very likely being louder than you think.\n\nEither way, you got upset for being asked to keep it down and seem to be trying to throw theories around as to why (aka, saying you were being discriminated against, blaming the sheriff for potentially reacting badly, assuming the other camp tattled on you when maybe you were just being too loud, etc.).

I have had friends have rangers look in their camper at night, look in coolers, yell at people for talking too loud, definitely if you smoke weed (I don\u2019t) in some states they also patrol specifically for that and it means you have to go back to that state for a court hearing, etc.  I saw them roll up middle of the day and find a cooler, look through it, unopened, no one drinking people were just reading a book and chilling, and demanded they open every single beer and dump it while they watched.

They automatically assumed the woman called the police, without a shred of evidence, and decided to retaliate.

CO told him that if he didn't stop he was going to make them leave. Guy then threatened to get the gun out of his truck and teach him a lesson. \n\nSuddenly it all clicked in his head when the CO pulled his pistol and started ordering them all to get down on the ground.

These group sites are specifically set further back so the groups can be louder without disturbing the smaller sites. They're popular for fraternities and stuff. You don't seem to have a great understanding of what these sites are actually like. It's absolutely nothing like camping on a hike, and people who do that type of thing probably don't consider it camping.", "diverse group of DRUNK assholes... of course some women and children didn't go confront a bunch of drunk men who were acting like assholes.", "Bingo. I\u2019ve worked at state and local parks in rural areas and this is how it plays out:\n\nSherif makes their rounds through camp sites once or twice daily and always stops by the camp host spot and asks if there are any sites they should know about. And by \u201cknow about\u201d, they are asking if there are any groups of college kids (or even big groups of adults) that are likely to be drinking and rowdy. The camp host or person at the kiosk will let them know the sites and they will usually do what this sherif did and swing by just to reiterate the rules. The last thing they want is to be called out in the middle of the night for a noise complaint at a camp site because they will be out of service for a long time if there is a major incident elsewhere. \n\nAnd spoiler, camp hosts and people working at the kiosks can spot the potentially problematic groups miles away.
