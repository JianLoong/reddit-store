It got posted some social media pages about my school and my roommate saw it and he was livid.\n\nHe said that I had no right to post that and that it was humiliating.

He believes he is ENTITLED to housekeeping services!  If you make a mess clean it up! I wonder if his Mommy is glad he is out of her house!", "NTA, I\u2019d go to the housing manager and show him all the video evidence to have your roommate removed\u2026 he sounds like a walking bio hazard", "NTA. He\u2019s mad because he got exposed for being lazy and not being responsible for cleaning up after himself\u2026 You should have went the the housing manager with the video evidence though", "NTA you should tell him the housing manager will kick him out too for destroying the dorm", "NTA , I had a roommate like this, she would put her dirty panties on the living room couch along with other clothes. The male roommates were too embarrassed to say something but avoided the living room because of that. She just let a month of panties pile. After asking many times to clean and stop this I had enough. I put some gloves, grabbed everything and let it on front of her bedroom. I did that while her friends were there. She was furious but stopped.", "NTA, but certainly passive-aggressive and hilarious. Dirty roommates are, unfortunately, a burden you will have to endure till you can afford your own place. I once threw away someone's dirty mug after it had been \"soaking\" in the sink for a week. It was definitely an AH move, but my point was made.", "NTA imo, I get that it\u2019s humiliating for him but at the same time you can\u2019t be bearing all this mental load. \n\nMaybe consider moving out, it would be simpler.", "\"He threatened to go to the housing manager \"\n\nBeat him to the punch.  Bring the housing manager to your room, show him how sloppy the roommate is, and demand a new roommate. \n\nRight now.  Get off reddit and get it done!\n\nESH though.  You were being petty and he's a slob.", "I didn\u2019t even read the whole post. It\u2019s your room too, right? He isn\u2019t doing his own thing behind a closed door and you invaded his privacy- he is right in there with you and you have to see it all-all the time? \n\nHa! Hilarious and such fun. I hope you got lots of upvotes or whatever. Do you even get upvotes on Tik tok? Whatever. \n\nNTA\n\nAnd maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad if *he* was \u201cremoved\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA, play stupid games you win stupid prizes.", "NTA to the roommate but YTA to yourself for putting yourself through this.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to put up with this, go to the housing manager and either try to move out or get him removed", "ESH\n\nThis was a terrible way of handling the situation. All he\u2019s focused on now is that you humiliated him in public and in his eyes you are the ahole and enemy and that will dominate his thinking instead of \u201ci need to clean up after myself\u201d. \n\nAlso you just made an enemy. One that knows where you sleep, when you sleep, and has a key.  If this guy is inclined to retaliate, he can do some real harm to you.  Congrats on becoming less secure.", "ESH! Don\u2019t like something, take the correct course. You talked to him, didn\u2019t work. You can involve the housing manager rather than posting stuff on TikTok. He\u2019s a slob and doesn\u2019t know what responsibilities are and is all around gross.", "I am a bit surprised by the answers saying this would be ok. \n\nYou say \"no one knows it was him\", but clearly it was recognised by other people since you say they identified the layout of the room. Sure, strangers don't know it's him, but other people in your building and your school do. \n\n  \nYour roommate sounds disgusting and does need to learn how to clean. But I find shaming them online - even without naming them, as there are enough details for him to be recognized by people who know him - is cruel and disproportionate and humiliating. \n\nSo YTA. I could go with everyone sucks but I think shaming him online is a bit worse.\n\nIf you live in student accommodation, there are other ways to escalate these issues if your flatmate is not doing their part in terms of cleaning. But I think that's a step too far.", "YTA:\n\nBut he deserves it", "Yta- I think anyone who posts TikTok\u2019s to embarrass other people are assholes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
