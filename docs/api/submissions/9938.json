The male roommates were too embarrassed to say something but avoided the living room because of that. She just let a month of panties pile.

All he\u2019s focused on now is that you humiliated him in public and in his eyes you are the ahole and enemy and that will dominate his thinking instead of \u201ci need to clean up after myself\u201d. \n\nAlso you just made an enemy. One that knows where you sleep, when you sleep, and has a key.  If this guy is inclined to retaliate, he can do some real harm to you.  Congrats on becoming less secure.", "ESH!

Sure, strangers don't know it's him, but other people in your building and your school do. \n\n  \nYour roommate sounds disgusting and does need to learn how to clean. But I find shaming them online - even without naming them, as there are enough details for him to be recognized by people who know him - is cruel and disproportionate and humiliating. \n\nSo YTA. I could go with everyone sucks but I think shaming him online is a bit worse.\n\nIf you live in student accommodation, there are other ways to escalate these issues if your flatmate is not doing their part in terms of cleaning.

And to make it worse, I guess she didn\u2019t see the point of cleaning it up after it happened because it would just happen again the next day. So for a full week out of every month I would have to stare at huge splotches of dried blood on her bed. She had no shame about it either.
