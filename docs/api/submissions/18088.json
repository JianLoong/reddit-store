I did too, so no judgement on my part. When Lauren was 18, she got pregnant and chose to get an abortion. This was her wake up call. She went to college, later got a great job and found her husband. They had a daughter, Roxy, who\u2019s now 17. \n\nRoxy is a very studious and responsible young woman, but this is in no doubt to how hard her parents are on her. Lauren has said several times that she doesn\u2019t want Roxy to end up like her. Which I understand but I\u2019ve also told her that she can\u2019t be so hard on her. Let her make mistakes and guide her through them vs yelling.\n\nRoxy found out she was pregnant in March. Lauren and her husband reacted horribly. I have a daughter who\u2019s of similar age and I know I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled either. However, Lauren and her husband  took it too far in my opinion. They shamed her, told her she\u2019s a disgrace. They said even if she got an abortion or gave the baby up for adoption, they found her irresponsible and didn\u2019t want her around. They kicked her out. Roxy\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents did the same. The two are now living with my family.\n\nThis has been incredibly hard on Roxy. She plans on raising the baby, but keeps saying she feels like a failure. I never knew how truly bad Lauren was, but she\u2019s always called Roxy horrible names and made her feel like she wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nI finally told Roxy all about her mom\u2019s past and told her that Lauren had no right to talk. I prefaced this by saying this isn\u2019t what made Lauren a bad person and I don\u2019t shame her. But used it as Lauren has no moral high ground.\n\nRoxy called Lauren and called her out on her hypocrisy. My extended family is mad at me. Most aren\u2019t happy with Lauren but say it wasn\u2019t my place to spread her business. Apparently her husband didn\u2019t know about her past either and is calling her a liar, etc. My parents and other family members say I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.", "created_utc": 1684954888, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13que9e/aita_for_telling_my_niece_about_her_moms_past/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister did a terrible job in raising Roxy, at least in some respects, because she feels so bad about herself.  Roxy has the right to know the truth about her mom's past, and so does her husband.  You did the right thing by telling her and a heroic thing by taking in Roxy and her boyfriend!", "NTA. What a hypocrite your sister is. You\u2019re trying to make your niece feel better when she\u2019s so vulnerable. It\u2019s a good thing she has you in her corner.", "NTA. Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Your friend changed her life around and suddenly got too big for her britches. \n\nAt least you were honest with Roxy. Especially since, per your post, Roxy is in a better place than your friend was.", "NTA. In this case, it was relevant to \"spread her business\". And you didn't tell that story this whole time, it wasn't a random thing.\n\nYour niece was suffering over the treatment of her mother. It was important for her to know this story, her feelings take precedence over your sister's pride.", "NTA. Your sister did blow it massively out of proportion, and based on how she apparently treated her well before all this, it just sounds like she flat resents her own kid, which is terrible. You're not wrong for being one of the few people trying to comfort your niece through a difficult time.\n\nGotta say, I'm even more incensed by their comment about 'even if you got an abortion', so they're basically pushing her even deeper into this hole, and this coming from the woman who ACTUALLY got to have her abortion and live her life without a lifetime of judgment? Shame on her.", "NTA. She tried to throw stones from her glass house and paid for it.

Did your sister use her past experience to teach her daughter about birth control and safety or did she just outright try to stifle it all? I doubt the former. She basically treated Roxy like *she* was guilty of mistakes before the fact and thus made it a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\n Even if Lauren did do the right thing (again highly doubtful),her and her husband\u2019s treatment of her was nothing less than disgraceful.

Sounds like you're dealing with a born again Christian type.  The worst judgment people of the whole Christian cult.", "NTA. Your sister could have used her past as an opportunity to guide Roxy through this difficult time.

And a whole lot of extra bonus points for you and your family for taking in the two of them.  You're good people.", "Oh no way! Sing that from the rooftops.

She needs the whole story because her mothers past makes her current behavior so much worse. Good on you.", "NTA: please please keep us informed! Also,  if she isn't 18. Check state laws. You might be able to get temporary guardianship of her so she can get financial aid.  If over 18 help her get aid from the state please!", "I agree. I kept the wild stuff I did from my son when he was younger, but I eventually used it as a way to discuss issues with him as an almost teenager. I would have been upset if anyone had told him before that. Thing is, as a policy, I was pretty lenient on him in high school because I lived as if I had no rules. So, as long as he wasn't hurting anyone, he was good to go in my mind. It worked out as well because I had credibility with him. He listened and stayed away from drinking and drugs until after high school. I could not ask for more than that.\n\n\n\nSo, having a mother kick her daughter out over something she had done herself is unforgivable in my book.", "100% this!\n\nSister is a hypocrite.

I have since learned he was equally as hard on Roxy and called her worse names than Lauren. \n\nBut I accept your judgement on the rest.", "In fairness her telling Roxy about Lauren's past was meant to help Roxy reconcile with facts like unintended pregnancies happen and happen to everyone including mother dearest. It wasn't meant to embarrass Lauren,  but to bring Roxy to the reality of life and make sure she doesn't go spiraling into depression and help her realize that she just like her mother can have a successful life even with a teen pregnancy. I honestly think it was fair to bring to light as Lauren clearly would have never mentioned it and it is extremely relevant. If Lauren didn't want her kid to turn out like her she should have been honest and taught the poor kid about birth control. One conversation and one trip to the doctors could've been enough to avoid all of this.", "My niece and her boyfriend have jobs. We are not contributing financially outside of them living here rent free. Her boyfriend already graduated so he\u2019s  working full time. She\u2019s already got a part time job and plans to switch to homeschooling online for next year. Unsure what that has to do with anything pertaining to this situation?", "Yeah, I don\u2019t really get it. My niece did explore all her options in the beginning and told them she was leaning towards abortion and they still threw her out for being \u201cirresponsible enough to get pregnant\u201d. She since changed her mind on getting one and they\u2019re even more pissed.", "She never taught Roxy about birth control. Instead told her to wait until marriage. Then when Roxy got pregnant, she shamed her and didn\u2019t even worry about her being safe or healthy. Just for \u201cruining her life\u201d.", "Right? No one is perfect, and failures/mistakes/accidents are often where the most learning comes from so if you can share your experiences with your kids (age appropriate) it can be a great bridge in many ways.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head though; It is the mother's reaction to her daughter's situation that is so horrifying as she experienced the same thing. The hypocrisy makes my heart hurt.", "Ignore the troll. Some people just love to shame unplanned pregnancies.\n\nThank you for being there for Roxy and her boyfriend, and for treating them like human people with thoughts and feelings and who can be held accountable for their choices.\n\nIt's not going to be easy for them, but then again parenting is never \"easy\".\n\nYour sister is a hypocrite and a liar, so good riddance. Hopefully the rest of the family will get their heads on straight and apologizes to you and Roxy."]}
