They had a daughter, Roxy, who\u2019s now 17. \n\nRoxy is a very studious and responsible young woman, but this is in no doubt to how hard her parents are on her.

I have a daughter who\u2019s of similar age and I know I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled either. However, Lauren and her husband  took it too far in my opinion. They shamed her, told her she\u2019s a disgrace. They said even if she got an abortion or gave the baby up for adoption, they found her irresponsible and didn\u2019t want her around. They kicked her out. Roxy\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents did the same. The two are now living with my family.\n\nThis has been incredibly hard on Roxy. She plans on raising the baby, but keeps saying she feels like a failure. I never knew how truly bad Lauren was, but she\u2019s always called Roxy horrible names and made her feel like she wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nI finally told Roxy all about her mom\u2019s past and told her that Lauren had no right to talk. I prefaced this by saying this isn\u2019t what made Lauren a bad person and I don\u2019t shame her. But used it as Lauren has no moral high ground.\n\nRoxy called Lauren and called her out on her hypocrisy. My extended family is mad at me.

Your sister was afforded the opportunity to turn her life around and make it better, why isn\u2019t she giving that same kindness to her own daughter?", "NTA", "NTA   \n\n\nRoxy is lucky to have a good aunt and Lauren can go right ahead and start making better decisions about her own behavior any time she wants.", "NTA.  Thank you for taking care of your niece. Your sister is a hypocrite. If she wants to throw mud at some one about their behavior, she needs to make sure no mud from her past comes back to haunt her.", "Nah, you're fine with telling her about the hypocrisy that she now has to deal with because of her money's two-faced actions.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I have 5 kids and had the first at 17 with NO SUPPORT. I've ALWAYS been transparent with them for the simple fact is, I've been there. These are the decisions that I HAVE MADE. If you want a different outcome, PLEASE COME TO ME to talk about different scenarios that work for YOU. I NEVER downplayed my decisions, but ALWAYS told them the truth. Was is good? IMO, yes. Did they LEARN from my choice? Yes, because they LIVED IT. Would I do it again? 1000% to have the open relationship that I have with them.", "NTA and it would be one thing if the mother was empathetic but harsh, but this situation feels like projection. Calling out her mom out is one thing but honestly I think it's much more important for you to advocate for your niece if this is how her parents are treating her. She is still ultimately a child and she's going to need as much support possible because based on this reaction she's not gonna get it from her parents.", "NTA Public history really. I bet you never agreed to keep that a secret. Ever. Funny that they have more of a problem with you speaking a few sentences than her lying her whole adult life and doing her best to tank her daughter's adult life.", "I might have asked my sister if she had anything to share before telling your niece. Either way, NTA. Thank you for being available to your niece.", "NTA. Your niece shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with her judgmental hypocritical parents. No contact for life.", "NTA; it became your place to be able to tell her about her mother's past once she was living with you.", "NTA. \n\nSaw the title and was thinking I wouldn't side with OP but OP's sister crossed so many lines that OP isn't the a-hole. Now, if Lauren and her husband let Roxy stay in the house, weren't absolutely trash to her, then I think OP would have been out of line. But once you kick out your 17 year old, you don't get any say imo. \n\nHopefully, Roxy will be able to process all of this information, the traumatic events that happened, and her immediate family abuse. But damn. \n\nGlass houses + stones = Lauren is the a-hole.", "NTA. Generational hypocrisy needs to stop. Kids deserve to be treated with respect. Kids should be allowed to learn from the adults' mistakes, and maybe if she had been told, she would've been more careful and not gotten pregnant to begin with.", "NTA I was ready to say otherwise until I read it all and very NTA. \n\nI was 14 1/2, my parents handled it very very badly. Last year at 57 I found out my mother had had at least 3 abortions. I cannot forgive her for how she treated me when I needed her most. She reviled and shamed me.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t believe there is an ethical obligation to keep the secrets of someone who has abused their child.", "Obviously YTA, you were gossiping with a teenager and went full teenager petty. This post reeks of hate.\n\nWhatever problems you have with your sister, don't fucking involve the niece. You should definitely help her out but don't go down to her level and take her and act like her, just help her and talk to your sister in private!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: It's clear how many people in this sub are around the niece's age lmao", "NTA, you are a great auntie!! \u263a\ufe0f stick by her and I hope good things come to you and her! \ud83e\udd70", "NTA.  Your sister made her choices and her bed.  You are the only one empowering this teen.  Good on you.", "Your sister should have used her past to warn her daughter and give her practical advice. Your sister also shouldn\u2019t have come down on her daughter the way she did, she should have had empathy for her. \n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t your job to tell. She made a choice years ago not to tell anyone about her past. It was her choice to make, not yours. You decided to tell and now the family unit is falling apart. You wouldn\u2019t want someone else to parent your children and yet you took it upon yourself to do that with your sister. \n\nWhat you should have done was go to your sister, point out the hypocrisy and demand that she opens up to her daughter or you will do it. It could have ended up as a bonding experience for them but now that is lost. It could have been done behind closed doors between mother and daughter but now you\u2019ve opened it to the whole family. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you an AH because you had I\u2019m sure good intentions but you didn\u2019t understand the fallout that would occur. Go talk to your sister, try to reason with her and see if you can broker a peace between them.", "NTA.\n\nThey say it's not your place to tell her that her mother is a hypocrite? It's also not your place to house someone else's daughter who needs love an support and isn't getting it from her parents, but since you've taken on the parental role for her, I see no reason why you shouldn't say something about it. The people backing your sister are indirectly supporting the decision she's making to disown her own daughter for making the same mistake she did. The hypocrisy in this situation is insane.\n\nINFO: Did Lauren's husband know about her abortion?", "Thank you for being there for your niece.", ">they seem to be showing maturity and responsibility by wanting to actually raise the child\n\nIt's just as mature and responsible to choose termination or adoption, though.  (I'd argue it's more so, in this case, but that's Roxy's choice to make.)  They're all valid choices, that's the point.", "absoloutely this. My eldest had so much pressure put on her by her dad (ex partner), he presented himself as being an excellent student who always studied and never got up to any mischief and always listened to his parents. He expected her to follow that example.\n\nExcept we got together in high school, so I know exactly what kind of student he was, and how much he listened to his mother, and the mischief he got up to lol. One time when our eldest was talking about how she felt like such a disappointment to him because she could never live up to his example, I said \"but he TOTALLY did *fill in the thing* as a teenager too\" without realising he had been fudging the facts. \n\nRealising that her dad wasn't as perfect as he was saying made such a difference. Her teenage rebellions were honestly pretty boring for the most part (thankfully) and she was a fantastic teenager and is now a fantastic young adult. She made/makes mistakes all the time just like everyone does, and then figures out how to sort them out, asks for help if she needs it, and doesn't take her dad's stories of his \"glory days\" too seriously anymore. And she doesn't feel so much like an automatic failure if she forgets to hang out her clothes the same day they were washed or gets the date of some event three years ago wrong, for example. \n\nKids generally do much better when they know their parents are just people. \n\nOP is doing the right thing by stepping in emotionally and physically for their niece when no one else in the family seems to want to do the right thing by her. That is the sign of a good person.

You shouldn\u2019t have burned your sister like that. However, your sister should have understood her daughters situation. So sad for your family. I hope you can reach out to your sister and make things right. I\u2019m sure she is feeling some deep pain over this. Hopefully, she apologizes to her child. Good luck.", "Her boyfriend is 18 so he qualifies and she\u2019ll be 18 before the baby is born, so she\u2019ll also qualify.", "You'd take the pregnant woman back to her abusive mother that kicked her out so she could get abused more and further distressed? And play some sort of weird game to see if you could force her mother to admit she's wrong?\n\nYou realize that does nothing right? Even forced to admit to her past as is, she isn't forgiving her daughter. People like that don't care, you can't pull out a counter and get them to admit to wrongdoing and fix things like that.", "On this sub a justified asshole is NTA", "Lauren's mum had the chance to tell Lauren about her secret when her own daughter ended up in the same situation - instead she ignored that chance and decided to call Lauren names and kick her out of the house. \n\nThe mum missed her chance. That's on her.", "> ESH - Except Roxy. Oh and maybe Roxy's dad - not sure about him, he may have been part of the strict rules in place in their house (is he religious) but yeah he probably is an AH for not supporting his daughter in this particular instance.\n> \n\nApparently Roxy's dad is furious at her mom for having had an abortion, so he's almost certainly a major part of this.", "I\u2019ve told her before she needs to be honest with Roxy about her past and she refused. How much time should I have given it?", "Lol. Her sister was never going to do that. She had 17 years and kicking out her daughter for the same thing she did worth of chances. A teenager made a mistake and her mother insulted her and threw her away. Daughter deserved to know that not everyone that throws stones is without sin.", ">You shouldn't have burned your sister like that. ... I hope you can reach out to your sister and make things right.\n\nAre you talking about the hypocritical sister who shamed her pregnant daughter and threw her pregnant daughter out on the streets to fend for herself?\n\nWhat an odd thing for you to focus on. You must be one of those people who want 'peace' at all costs -- even though it means protecting the lies of hypocritical sister from exposure. Whatever it takes for you to enjoy 'peace', regardless of the injustice.", "I'm getting the distinct impression it would be more accurate to say it would \"ruin\" what her co-religionists would think of her.", "Oh good! You are NTA btw. \nI used my life as an example to help guide my children. I believe that they need to know that I was wild just like they are lol.", "> In fairness her telling Roxy about Lauren's past was meant to help Roxy reconcile with facts\n\nOh yeah, I get that, which is why in the OPs position I might very well have done exactly the same thing.\n\n> If Lauren didn't want her kid to turn out like her she should have been honest and taught the poor kid about birth control. One conversation and one trip to the doctors could've been enough to avoid all of this.\n\nSpot ON!", "Yes. Not remotely the same but Dr. King phrased this exceptionally well when speaking of the difference between negative peace which is the absence of violence and positive peace which is the presence of justice."]}
