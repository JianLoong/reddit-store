I did too, so no judgement on my part. When Lauren was 18, she got pregnant and chose to get an abortion. This was her wake up call. She went to college, later got a great job and found her husband. They had a daughter, Roxy, who\u2019s now 17. \n\nRoxy is a very studious and responsible young woman, but this is in no doubt to how hard her parents are on her. Lauren has said several times that she doesn\u2019t want Roxy to end up like her. Which I understand but I\u2019ve also told her that she can\u2019t be so hard on her. Let her make mistakes and guide her through them vs yelling.\n\nRoxy found out she was pregnant in March. Lauren and her husband reacted horribly. I have a daughter who\u2019s of similar age and I know I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled either. However, Lauren and her husband  took it too far in my opinion. They shamed her, told her she\u2019s a disgrace. They said even if she got an abortion or gave the baby up for adoption, they found her irresponsible and didn\u2019t want her around. They kicked her out. Roxy\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents did the same. The two are now living with my family.\n\nThis has been incredibly hard on Roxy. She plans on raising the baby, but keeps saying she feels like a failure. I never knew how truly bad Lauren was, but she\u2019s always called Roxy horrible names and made her feel like she wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nI finally told Roxy all about her mom\u2019s past and told her that Lauren had no right to talk. I prefaced this by saying this isn\u2019t what made Lauren a bad person and I don\u2019t shame her. But used it as Lauren has no moral high ground.\n\nRoxy called Lauren and called her out on her hypocrisy. My extended family is mad at me. Most aren\u2019t happy with Lauren but say it wasn\u2019t my place to spread her business. Apparently her husband didn\u2019t know about her past either and is calling her a liar, etc. My parents and other family members say I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.\n\nEDIT: Please stop asking me what their plans are, what jobs they have, are they truly prepared, etc. Not the point of this post nor any of your business or concern. We are working on everything one day at a time. You don\u2019t know these kids or their lives. I know their situation. It won\u2019t be easy but it is what it is. I cannot force her to get an abortion. Stick to the topic at hand.

My therapist was also pro choice, like most educated people (not a dig, this is a demographic thing).  Not really sure what your point is, but maybe seek therapy for why you care more about zygotes than conscious, feeling, adult women?
