No way to say that without sounding arrogant or braggy, but it is what it is. If I've got some spare money I will frequently treat friends to food or drinks.\n\nBut I have a rule: If I'm treating you to a meal (or snack or whatever), and you want to take a pic of your food, you HAVE to have at least a bite before you take your pic.\n\nIt's a simple, stupid rule to be sure, but it really just came about years back when smartphones were less than a decade old, and TONS of people were flooding the internet with pics of their food that no one cared about on every budding social media account.\n\nI've got nothing against things like Food Porn (generally like it, actually), but it became a bit of a pet peeve when I'd treat people to a meal and see everyone whip out their phones like getting that picture was more important than the meal itself.\n\nSo so became my rule. If I bought a dozen fancy-ass muffins from Whole Foods to share with my coworkers, you had to take a bite before you could instagram it. \"But then it's not PERFECT!\" Yeah that's the point, if you care more about your perfect picture than the food, well there's other coworkers here not so quick on the draw that still want free snacks.\n\nThe rule is mostly obsolete now. People still take pics, but the instagram food pic craze has died down a lot so it rarely gets brought up, and most people don't think 'one bite' from their meal will make their 'perfect picture' any less food-porn worthy.\n\nBut the other day it DID come up. Treated some friends at a restaurant, a phone got whipped out, I reflexively brought up \"You gotta take a bite first,\" and for the first time in like 8 years they got REALLY upset about it. \"But then it's not PERFECT!\"\n\nI didn't expect the 0 to 80 escalation, so just tried being lighthearted about it, but still stuck to my old ass rule. \"If getting the perfect picture is more important than the meal, you can cover your own meal.\" A bite was taken, a pic was taken, and she was grumpy the rest of the meal. Which of course made things a bit awkward for everyone else. People tried to just move past it, but with the mood heavy I got some pretty clear \"Would it REALLY have been that big a deal...\" looks.\n\nI know it's a silly, petty rule, but also think it's a minor 'demand' when I'm footing the bill. AITA for making a dinner awkward by putting my foot down and enforcing my 'rule'?\n\n\\[edit\\] minor grammer and spelling fixes", "created_utc": 1679713705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1218mrn/aita_for_not_letting_someone_take_a_perfect_pic/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By enforcing your  \"rule\", the mood and night were ruined.\n\nAlso, you really need to consider what your baggage is, OP, because your \"rule\" is controlling and, frankly, senseless.\n\nYour pet peeve is people whipping out their phones to take a picture \"like getting that picture was more important than the meal itself\" when you treat them. What kind of logic is that, OP? The vast majority of people who want to take a photo of their food are doing it because they appreciate the chef's/cook's/baker's effort and labor that made the food look so lovely. How is wanting a way to remember (and possibly even share) that loveliness later translate into \"making the photo more important than the meal itself\" to you?\n\nActually, how does taking a few moments - even a full minute or two - to take a picture of ANYTHING make you think that getting the picture is more important than the thing itself? Do you think that people who photograph their pets care more about getting the photos than their pets? Do you think people that photograph their kids care more about getting those photos than the kids? Or does this bizarre hang up of yours only apply to food?\n\nAre there people who care more about photographic perfection than the thing itself? Yes, absolutely. If you had a friend who would let their food go cold as they took snapshot after snapshot until they finally got \"the perfect photo\" that they wanted---then, yes, that one person cared more about the picture than the meal itself. But I have a feeling that if any of your friends had done this to a meal you had treated them to, you would've recounted it here and you haven't, which leads me to believe that nobody you have treated to a meal has **ever** cared about the perfect photo more than the meal/food itself. \n\nIf your rule was \"you cannot take longer than a minute to take a picture of your food,\" okay, **that** actually makes sense in relation to the pet peeve you've described here.

If I've got some spare money I will frequently treat friends to food or drinks. \n\nBut I have a rule: If I'm treating you to a meal (or snack or whatever), and you want to take a pic of your food, you HAVE to have at least a bite before you take your pic. \n\nIt's a simple, stupid rule to be sure, but it really just came about years back when smartphones were less than a decade old, and TONS of people were flooding the internet with pics of their food on every budding social media account. \n\nI've got nothing against things like Food Porn (generally like it, actually), but it became a bit of a pet peeve when I'd treat people to a meal and see everyone whip out their phones like getting that picture was more important than the meal itself. \n\nSo so became my rule. If I bought a dozen fancy-ass muffins from Whole Foods to share with my coworkers, you had to take a bite before you could instagram it. \"But then it's not PERFECT!\" Yeah that's the point, if you care more about your perfect picture than the food, well there's other coworkers here not so quick on the draw that still want free snacks. \n\nThe rule is mostly obsolete now. People still take pics, but the instagram food pic crazy has died down a lot so it rarely gets brought up, and most people don't think 'one bite' from their meal will make their 'perfect picture' any less food-porn worthy. \n\nBut the other day it DID come up. Treated some friends at a restaurant, a phone got whipped out, I reflexively brought up \"You gotta take a bite first,\" and for the first time in like 8 years they got REALLY upset about it. \"But then it's not PERFECT!\"\n\nI didn't expect the 0 to 80 escalation, so just tried being lighthearted about it, but still stuck to my old ass rule. \"If getting the perfect picture is more important the meal, you can cover your own meal.\" A bite was taken, a pic was taken, and she was grumpy the rest of the meal. Which of course made things a bit awkward for everyone else. People tried to just move past it, but with the mood heavy I got some pretty clear \"Would it REALLY have been that big a deal...\" looks. \n\nI know it's a silly, petty rule, but also think it's a minor 'demand' when I'm footing the bill. AITA for making a dinner awkward by putting my foot down and enforcing my 'rule'?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These aren't children and you don't get to dictate how they eat their food even if you're paying.", "You have a RULE??? YTA.", "YTA. I only needed to read until you mentioned the \u201crule\u201d part. Who the hell do you think you are? You\u2019re so grossly entitled and self centred.", "YTA stupid ass rule.", "YTA on a power trip", "You\u2019re conflating being controlling with generosity.\n\nTwo different things.\n\nYou fill your need to play big shot by picking up the check. Then because you\u2019re picking up the check you get to make the rules, thus fulfilling your need to control.\n\nNeither kind, nor generous. \n\nYTA", "What an odd thing to do. YTA. A gift is a gift. What's dove with said gift is not up to you.", "You sound really annoying. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not getting \u201cgenerous\u201d vibes from you so much as, \u201cI like to flex my money because it gives me an opportunity to exercise control over other people in petty ways.\u201d \n\nIf you were truly \u201cgenerous,\u201d you\u2019d allow people to enjoy the food/drinks that you buy however they want and simply be happy to provide them with that opportunity. You\u2019re *not* generous, you just want to *look* generous and be praised as a result. Whether or not someone takes a picture of their food first has no actual impact on you and the real reason you can\u2019t stand it is because your ego can\u2019t handle the idea of someone\u2019s attention being off their benevolent provider for even a second. \n\nYTA. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou create situations just so you get to control them. \n\nThese are not gifts...they're power plays. \n\nAlso, you're not generous...you're controlling.", "YTA \n\nIf you told me my meal came with terms and conditions, I'd tell you to fuck off.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s their food.

It\u2019s a silly, petty, stupid rule and also some weird power play on your end. Ditch it.", "YTA, it sounds like you need to work on your control issues.", " YTA this is weird control issue.", "I can completely understand this from an annoying perspective, where we see people taking photos and videos of their food before letting their friends eat. However, this is going to be the reason no one will let you pay for their meals, let alone ask you for lunch. \n\nYTA. Time to chill dude.", "YTA. That is an incredibly petty and controlling mandate you're trying to force onto others. And I don't even like those food posts, because I think too many people spend more time trying to impress their social media drones with their fake perfect lives than they do just enjoying life. But that's just me. I don't tell others they can't do it just because I think it's silly.", "YTA That\u2019s weirdly controlling. Stop treating people if you\u2019re going to a jerk about it.", "YTA and a petty control freak.", "Info: what sort of sick pleasure do you get from this? It's a control thing right?

There'll be a trend to take a picture of it on the way out next.", "You are not generous. You're controlling. \n\nYTA", "YTA: probably would never accept another meal from you or treat you to one in return. If a gift comes with strings, it\u2019s not really a gift.

You seem insufferable.", "\u201cI was generous and bought that food for you. Now, you must do as I say\u201d. Yuck. You don\u2019t understand what generosity means", "YTA. This is a controlling flex.

A picture takes all of 30 seconds. It has no impact on the food. You act like that picture is going to make the food taste different. You have some serious control issues.", "YTA trying to control how people enjoy their food is way more obnoxious than taking a photo of food.", "YTA you sound more controlling than generous.

If you gave someone a jumper (sweatshirt for our western colleagues) would you expect them to only ever wear it when they\u2019re hanging out with you?\n\nYTA", "Your a strange A softly, sorry but that's just weird, it's odd to be that worried over something like that. Yeah its just strange to me", "YTA - sounds very controlling to me, especially as you even do this with coworkers. Be proud you provide food they even want to photograph.", "YTA get a new hobby.", "You're definitely the AH. \n\nThis isn't quirky or cute. YTA.", "YTA - You are not being generous. You are being controlling. You are clearly an insecure person who wants people to grovel over your gifts, but then you show them who is in control by forcing your rules. I'm also guessing that you enjoy thinking that other people know who bought the food when they see that one bite in the picture. You are sad...and single, I assume.", "YTA. this is just obnoxious behavior idek what to say.", "Yta . \nSounds like u like controlling people", "YTA. Who puts rules on food they buy for others? You sound unbelievably judgmental, controlling and obsessive. Let people enjoy their freedom, enjoy their food and enjoy their pictures without your input.

Why are you being so controlling and weird?", "Well said, I was trying to think of a way to say that gifts shouldn\u2019t come with a set of rules", "A weird hill to dine on", "I was going to say a gift with strings is not a gift. This is a ridiculous \u2018rule\u2019.", "Exactly!  OP is not as generous as he thinks if his gifts come with strings attached. That's control, not generosity.  Jump through my hoop I admit is dated and not really a big deal or I won't pay for your meal. I would have been salty the rest of the night too.  This guy ruined everyone's dinner for what?  YTA 100%!", "Well you can - they're called conditional gifts and the most common is the engagement ring.

Op describes themself as a generous person, but some people often use the guise of generosity and kindness as a means of manipulation. It\u2019s a classic sign of an abusive personality and often times narcissism. There is something seriously wrong with Op.", "That\u2019s what I thought too. He picks a restaurant that\u2019s out of the friends price range, then when the food arrives he voices his stupid rule and smugly watches his \u201cfriends\u201d get increasingly uncomfortable. That\u2019s soooo messed up", "I mean, even if they're taking minutes to photograph their food while it gets cold, that's really none of OP's business and it still wouldn't be appropriate for him to try to force them to change their behavior just because he paid for the meal. They waste time, their food gets cold, the natural consequence is that they're now eating cold food - end of story.", "Yes! Seriously creepy vibes.", "You can't put rules on gifts.", "How fucked up are you to think putting your friends on a timer and TAKING AWAY THEIR FOOD if they don't start eating it is even remotely acceptable behavior", "There is a massive difference between someone wanting to take a picture of their OWN food and making you wait so they can take pictures of your food.", "You think that's bad, watched a podcast with Bobby Lee where he tells about how he takes people to eat, but they can't have their leftovers, they have to leave the food to be thrown away because he is paying for the experience not your lunch tomorrow.", "He he he", "You don't *have* to give it back, no. It's considered polite to but it's not a legal obligation.", "You don\u2019t see a difference between rules for safety in a machine that has the potential to kill people if you make a mistake and whatever power trip OP is going on?", "There's a difference between a parent setting stipulations on a gift to a child and a grown adult setting stipulations on a gift to another grown adult.", "This is true. I'm still with op though. I enjoying putting my phone down and talking to people over food. When I have to compete phones it's a pain. Especially when one picture isn't enough and then they sit and edit or and post it and have to find the perfect caption for it. Weather it's just their food or mine as well, I'm still with OP on this.", "That's obnoxious and completely wasteful.", "That is so ridiculous. I would sit there for as long as it took to force every bite down my throat even if I was full just to spite him.", "I googled.. first response on the page :  \n\"The Court found an engagement ring is a 'conditional gift' given to someone on the condition that they will get married. When they failed to do so, it must be returned unless there is legal justification not to.\"", "In Australia it's a legal obligation because it's a conditional gift and by not marrying, they failed to meet the legal condition required to keep the gift.", "Wrong.

This is why proposals on gifting holidays like Christmas or Valentine\u2019s Day, or a birthday are terrible ideas, the ring could technically be considered a Christmas or birthday gift or whatever which negates the conditionality if the engagement gets broken.", "Interesting.", "I bet you\u2019re real fun at parties.", "Well crafted response, concise and on topic, a solid 5/7!"]}
