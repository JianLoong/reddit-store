She is recovering from vomiting constantly and now it's just once in a week or two. We both work from home. I try to do the majority of of household chores (cooking, dishes, laundry, cleaning, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc). Though it's a small apartment and no kids so it's not really much work. And we typically just have milk and bread for breakfast which I bring to her bed. She helps with cooking whenever she is feeling good and very lately she has started to cook more than me; otherwise I cook the dinner with often some assistance from her (cutting onions etc). We save the dinner for lunch next day. \n\nIt's a good going most of the time. The problem is that my wife keeps complaining to me that she is hungry and I haven't fed her. I do offer snacks like banana, fruits and nuts but she says she is looking for some real food because she is really hungry. When I ask her what do you want me to make, she often doesn't have an answer and tells me she doesn't know but is hungry. If I offer to make something, say, soup, or boiled potatoes she shoots it down for one reason or the other (it's carb and not good; it's too light and she is too hungry etc). This gets me visibly frustrated. \n\nToday, she agreed to a serving of water melon which I cut and served. While cutting it, I asked her to tell me what she wants to eat because she will start complaining in while that she is hungry and I can't immediately have something ready to eat because it takes preparation. She said she is good for a while and didn't entertain my question.\n\n\nAs predicted, when I visited her room in an hour or so after work, she started pouting that she is hungry and I didn't feed her anything since lunch throughout the day. This made me a bit angry because I did feed her the melon and some dry snacks. It just wasn't a proper food. Moreover, I had asked her what to eat exactly for this reason, and she had refused to answer then. I told her she is expecting too much from me - both figuring out what to make and make them. I asked her that she should at least take responsibility for figuring out what to eat and let me know in advance. She felt like I was invalidating her and then said \"Okay, won't tell you anything from now on\", pouting. I got annoyed and left the room.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686358194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145m2w9/aita_for_not_preparing_my_pregnant_wife_food/", "score": 2381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If having for breakfast, I had a boiled egg or two as a snack later to keep full longer. \n\n- Vegetable omelet with favorite cheese and a simple spring mix salad.\n\n- Nicoise salad but replaced tuna with salmon.

I would also serve this with either hard boiled eggs, a bit of shredded chicken, or a frozen salmon fillet (I could buy these frozen in individual portions for pretty cheap, and if you chuck it in the oven at the same time as putting the point of water on to boil for the noodles, it should be cooked through by time water boiled and noodles ready - and again, healthy fats, and omega 3's strongly recommended for in pregnancy, and salmon is known as a lower mercury fish!)\n2.

It may help to have toast with peanut butter or a small bean and cheese burrito an hour or so before deciding what to have for the main meal.\n\nI would also encourage you to talk to your wife about what\u2019s eating *her*. Is she afraid that if she gains more than ten pounds during pregnancy, she\u2019ll become morbidly obese and hideous to herself and to you? Has she ever struggled with an eating disorder? \n\nIs she going out with you, with friends and family? Vomiting once a week is not a reason to isolate yourself from the world. Does she have a favorite restaurant? Have you stopped going there since she developed morning sickness? \n\nSome of the behaviors you\u2019re indicating are concerning for both the mental and physical health of your wife and in terms of ensuring adequate growth of the baby. When is her next OB/GYN appointment? You definitely want to be there and make sure to ask about calorie and nutritional requirements in a curious, non-judgmental way.\n\nEvery pregnancy is different, but I think there are early warning signs here that suggest something else may be going on that needs to be checked out, both by a physician and a therapist.

No one's at fault here, just a hungry/sick pregnant woman and her partner trying to be helpful but doesn't know how to.", "NTA. She\u2019s pregnant, not a disabled. She is 100% capable of getting food for herself. She needs to act like an adult and use her words if she needs something, not pout about it. \n\nIf she was on bed rest, that would be different, but she\u2019s not.", "Right? If she's like this already how's it going to be once the kid is born? Since when are pregnant women so delicate that they can't fend for themselves? I", "In fairness, trail mix can be pretty dense, depending what's in it. Peanuts, chocolate, dried fruit, those can all go a long way.", "We all get upset and frustrated with our partners and/or with the situations we find ourselves in from time to time. I agree that comment wasn't good, but I feel like people here are awfully quick to jump to broad ill intent and entitlement. What I hear  here is a woman who's felt like warmed-over death for 4 months and can't seem to find a way out of it, and her husband is telling her she needs to do more and that feels overwhelming, and she snapped 'cause she's frustrated. I wouldn't automatically assume from this that she's a lousy person or partner. Once this lady gets some food into her, she might be a lot more happy and pleasant to be around.", "Lol their getting downvoted for making excuses for poor behaviour. She does need meals throughout the day, but she\u2019s being unreasonable with her current stance.", "I eat almost completely plant based, and I have plenty of calorie dense foods.", "They possibly need more fats (depending on how things are cooked and what's added to them.) They're eating lentils or meat, not both.\n\nTheir diet isn't inherently bad---it's better than a lot of people eat, it's just that pregnant women need a LOT more nutrition (I don't just mean more calories).", "But I'm not seeing a lot of things like nuts on her list", "None of that makes him the asshole lol, and when their partner is prone to having very specific cravings or taste most partners would be asking what they want. What\u2019s the point of making food you\u2019re partner won\u2019t eat lol.\n\nThe mental gymnastics to make him the asshole is laughable", "Yep. Adding nuts and seeds add healthy fats, as well as olives and avocado. Whole grain pasta and rice, beans and quinoa. Hummus. All calorie and nutrient dense.", "I do that but mostly because I have zero appetite from my meds and sometimes it\u2019s easy to just eat a spoonful or two of peanut butter.", "Mine said/did this too!", "When I was pregnant I couldn't even look at whole steaks, chicken breast etc.  Instantly felt nauseous. Survived on meat mince and cutlets and fish. \n\nUsually I love well made steak.", "I\u2019m vegetarian but I craved chicken this last time. I haven\u2019t eaten any in over a decade. \n\nBut when I thought about chewing into flesh it made me ill so I know I didn\u2019t really want it.", "YTA, gets woman pregnant then complains about predictable pregnancy symptoms", "Kinda feel like YTA for Listing all the things you do, without considering that if the roles were reversed, she wouldn\u2019t be listing these things? I know when my partner is even sick I do these things without being asked, and if they are \u201cfussy\u201d or whatever I know it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re not feeling great, much less pregnancy hormones. I think the best thing to do is maybe a sit-down meal plan every Sunday or something, like \u201cMonday I have a banana for breakfast, a sandwich in the fridge for lunch, a microwave meal for dinner (if she can microwave or you can), and two packets of cereal bars for snacks I\u2019ll leave by your bedside\u201d, makes less stress for both of you.", "Fruit for a pregnant woman? No wonder she's hungry.\n\nAdd that and too many vegetables you're looking at serious caloric deficit and health problems for both of them.\n\nEven if plant based the bulk of the meals should be starch, even dry carbs to get enough calories in.\n\nA slice of watermelon :))\n\nI eat 2 kg at a time and I'm hungry an hour later ( it's mostly water )", "How is op the asshole. He\u2019s done everything he can and gets shot down every time. Yes she may have hormones going ham but that doesn\u2019t excuse the ability to not be vocal about what you want. If you can\u2019t offer potential solutions when it\u2019s not something you want then that\u2019s your fault and no one else\u2019s.", "None of this makes him an asshole.", "...or she could make sure she's eating enough too? She's responsible for her own health.", "If the homemade food you make is healthy, then freezing to later defrost remains healthy.  You can meal prep minestrone, chili, etc., and freeze in Mason jars. I punch up the protein in both of those with quinoa.  I also make over night oats with peanut butter and frozen berries. You can add in chia seeds and flax meal, neither of which change the taste.", "All I saw in the OP is that she doesn't want too many carbs but specifically he mentioned that the meals he offered she said were *too light* and she was *really hungry.*\n\nRed flags.", "Yes actually, I take medication that has a side effect of nausea and vomiting. And it was still never my husbands fault if he couldn\u2019t figure out what I could/couldn\u2019t eat. You try crackers, toast any of those things. She\u2019s a grown ass adult she can work on something to figure out or not eat until she does, but it\u2019s still NOT HER HUSBANDS JOB to read her mind. \n\nThis dude is working full time and trying to feed someone that won\u2019t eat soup, won\u2019t eat starch, won\u2019t eat stuff he already cooked and is mad he doesn\u2019t have food ready when she wants it. It\u2019s  completely understandable about every single part of it except where she blames her husband and guilt trips him when he doesn\u2019t have something the second she wants it.", "Also, check blood sugar levels. Gestational diabetes is rough but super common - often diagnosed around 5 months.\n\nBread (not so much the milk unless an alternative milk) will spike and crash her sugars. That will make her more tired and struggle think straight, making it harder to think of meals etc. \n\nThere is a good possibility OP's wife is actually sick and needs some medical input on her diet, and potentially medication.", "I\u2019m on full bed rest and pregnant, and I still try to be very patient when asking my husband for things, and also make sure to say \u201cthank you\u201d and express appreciation. \n\nI think she\u2019s the AH just because she\u2019s lacking in patience and understanding when someone is ultimately just trying to help, and she\u2019s not even on bed rest.", "Be incapable of reading minds I guess"]}
