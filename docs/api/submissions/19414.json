She is recovering from vomiting constantly and now it's just once in a week or two. We both work from home. I try to do the majority of of household chores (cooking, dishes, laundry, cleaning, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc). Though it's a small apartment and no kids so it's not really much work. And we typically just have milk and bread for breakfast which I bring to her bed. She helps with cooking whenever she is feeling good and very lately she has started to cook more than me; otherwise I cook the dinner with often some assistance from her (cutting onions etc). We save the dinner for lunch next day. \n\nIt's a good going most of the time. The problem is that my wife keeps complaining to me that she is hungry and I haven't fed her. I do offer snacks like banana, fruits and nuts but she says she is looking for some real food because she is really hungry. When I ask her what do you want me to make, she often doesn't have an answer and tells me she doesn't know but is hungry. If I offer to make something, say, soup, or boiled potatoes she shoots it down for one reason or the other (it's carb and not good; it's too light and she is too hungry etc). This gets me visibly frustrated. \n\nToday, she agreed to a serving of water melon which I cut and served. While cutting it, I asked her to tell me what she wants to eat because she will start complaining in while that she is hungry and I can't immediately have something ready to eat because it takes preparation. She said she is good for a while and didn't entertain my question.\n\n\nAs predicted, when I visited her room in an hour or so after work, she started pouting that she is hungry and I didn't feed her anything since lunch throughout the day. This made me a bit angry because I did feed her the melon and some dry snacks. It just wasn't a proper food. Moreover, I had asked her what to eat exactly for this reason, and she had refused to answer then. I told her she is expecting too much from me - both figuring out what to make and make them. I asked her that she should at least take responsibility for figuring out what to eat and let me know in advance. She felt like I was invalidating her and then said \"Okay, won't tell you anything from now on\", pouting.

I broke down quite a few times because I literally just couldn't think of what to eat. When my husband was away at work last pregnancy I barely ate any actual meals and just cooked for my son. It was the hardest thing to decide on a meal to eat.", "This person took \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d and \u201cmental load\u201d straight from Reddit comments and decided to apply it to one of their own without bothering to look up what either term actually means. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t throw \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201cred flags\u201d in there too.", "A woman I knew did this all the time. She'd send her husband out to get her whatever she was craving and by the time he got back, she'd want something different. I would have gone insane", "He doesn\u2019t know what his wife eats.  Can\u2019t for the life of him figure out what to make for dinner unless she tells him.  Is only willing to open a can or cut up fruit.  I guess that\u2019s just Incompetence.  \n\nIf I had been with this woman even for just the past few months, I\u2019d know what food she would eat.  He\u2019s married to her and he can\u2019t figure it out?  Whatever.", "When there are chemicals in your body that are changing how your brain functions, being an adult is not enough to manage this. \n\nI am not saying that other people should just accept and get over it, I am saying that the person cannot always control how they are acting when there are other factors preventing them from acting as they usually would. \n\nIn normal circumstances, I would agree with you, but with this, you are completely wrong. \n\nPregnancy is commonly know to changes a person's way of thinking and even completely change a person personality. There's countless of studies, support groups, specialist etc. \n\nJust expecting someone to 'feel your feelings' is a completely sheltered and backwards view, when realistically it is a lot more complex than that.", "Oh, she refuses to eat anything remotely \"unhealthy\". That includes take outs, let alone frozen meals.", "I know what she likes for dinner or lunch. Just not what for mid afternoon snacks which we never used to have.", "I can agree that it's more than managing normal feelings. But I'd never accept it as an excuse. Reasons behind bad behavior never justifies, nor excuses, bad behavior.", "I'd like to see your research that pregnancy \"commonly\" changes a person's whole personality.\n\nThis sounds a lot like excusing shitty behavior just because she's pregnant.  \n\nHave a child, experienced a hellish pregnancy that left me with significant trauma and had severe PPD.  Didn't treat my ex husband like trash (though I did make him crazy with some craving requests).", "Speaking from experience, that's probably what her body is craving. She doesn't want to give in and is taking it out on you.\n\nCostco pizza never tasted better than when I was pregnant... and french fries....", "This is actively dangerous if she can\u2019t keep food down. She needs calories and often \u201cunhealthy\u201d foods have that reputation because they\u2019re calorie-dense, which is bad for weight loss but good for people having trouble eating enough.   \n\n\ncould you bring this up at her next doctors appointment?", "OP, don\u2019t listen to this person. Eating during pregnancy is a notoriously dicey prospect for so many. It\u2019s not your responsibility to read your wife\u2019s mind.\n\nThough I do cut her some slack because she\u2019s been having nasty symptoms, I still think I\u2019d be embarrassed if I\u2019d acted this way when pregnant."]}
