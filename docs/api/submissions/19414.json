She is recovering from vomiting constantly and now it's just once in a week or two. We both work from home. I try to do the majority of of household chores (cooking, dishes, laundry, cleaning, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc). Though it's a small apartment and no kids so it's not really much work. And we typically just have milk and bread for breakfast which I bring to her bed. She helps with cooking whenever she is feeling good and very lately she has started to cook more than me; otherwise I cook the dinner with often some assistance from her (cutting onions etc). We save the dinner for lunch next day. \n\nIt's a good going most of the time. The problem is that my wife keeps complaining to me that she is hungry and I haven't fed her. I do offer snacks like banana, fruits and nuts but she says she is looking for some real food because she is really hungry. When I ask her what do you want me to make, she often doesn't have an answer and tells me she doesn't know but is hungry. If I offer to make something, say, soup, or boiled potatoes she shoots it down for one reason or the other (it's carb and not good; it's too light and she is too hungry etc). This gets me visibly frustrated. \n\nToday, she agreed to a serving of water melon which I cut and served. While cutting it, I asked her to tell me what she wants to eat because she will start complaining in while that she is hungry and I can't immediately have something ready to eat because it takes preparation. She said she is good for a while and didn't entertain my question.\n\n\nAs predicted, when I visited her room in an hour or so after work, she started pouting that she is hungry and I didn't feed her anything since lunch throughout the day. This made me a bit angry because I did feed her the melon and some dry snacks. It just wasn't a proper food. Moreover, I had asked her what to eat exactly for this reason, and she had refused to answer then. I told her she is expecting too much from me - both figuring out what to make and make them. I asked her that she should at least take responsibility for figuring out what to eat and let me know in advance. She felt like I was invalidating her and then said \"Okay, won't tell you anything from now on\", pouting. I got annoyed and left the room.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686358194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145m2w9/aita_for_not_preparing_my_pregnant_wife_food/", "score": 1049, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If having for breakfast, I had a boiled egg or two as a snack later to keep full longer. \n\n- Vegetable omelet with favorite cheese and a simple spring mix salad.\n\n- Nicoise salad but replaced tuna with salmon.

I would also serve this with either hard boiled eggs, a bit of shredded chicken, or a frozen salmon fillet (I could buy these frozen in individual portions for pretty cheap, and if you chuck it in the oven at the same time as putting the point of water on to boil for the noodles, it should be cooked through by time water boiled and noodles ready - and again, healthy fats, and omega 3's strongly recommended for in pregnancy, and salmon is known as a lower mercury fish!)\n2.
