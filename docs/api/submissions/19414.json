{"id": 19414, "submission_id": "145m2w9", "title": "AITA for not preparing my pregnant wife food", "selftext": "My wife is 5 months pregnant and has started to feel hungry a lot. She is recovering from vomiting constantly and now it's just once in a week or two. We both work from home. I try to do the majority of of household chores (cooking, dishes, laundry, cleaning, breakfast, lunch, dinner etc). Though it's a small apartment and no kids so it's not really much work. And we typically just have milk and bread for breakfast which I bring to her bed. She helps with cooking whenever she is feeling good and very lately she has started to cook more than me; otherwise I cook the dinner with often some assistance from her (cutting onions etc). We save the dinner for lunch next day. \n\nIt's a good going most of the time. The problem is that my wife keeps complaining to me that she is hungry and I haven't fed her. I do offer snacks like banana, fruits and nuts but she says she is looking for some real food because she is really hungry. When I ask her what do you want me to make, she often doesn't have an answer and tells me she doesn't know but is hungry. If I offer to make something, say, soup, or boiled potatoes she shoots it down for one reason or the other (it's carb and not good; it's too light and she is too hungry etc). This gets me visibly frustrated. \n\nToday, she agreed to a serving of water melon which I cut and served. While cutting it, I asked her to tell me what she wants to eat because she will start complaining in while that she is hungry and I can't immediately have something ready to eat because it takes preparation. She said she is good for a while and didn't entertain my question.\n\n\nAs predicted, when I visited her room in an hour or so after work, she started pouting that she is hungry and I didn't feed her anything since lunch throughout the day. This made me a bit angry because I did feed her the melon and some dry snacks. It just wasn't a proper food. Moreover, I had asked her what to eat exactly for this reason, and she had refused to answer then. I told her she is expecting too much from me - both figuring out what to make and make them. I asked her that she should at least take responsibility for figuring out what to eat and let me know in advance. She felt like I was invalidating her and then said \"Okay, won't tell you anything from now on\", pouting. I got annoyed and left the room.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686358194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145m2w9/aita_for_not_preparing_my_pregnant_wife_food/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was dancing, being crazy & wanting to fight my mil 5 mins b4. She wanted to be in bed, waited on the entire time. Come to find out, the test was wrong.

She needs actual meals. I needed to eat something substantial about every 2 hours, so I feel for her. Eating frequently also curbs nausea.", "That being said, pregnancy can be a hormonal minefield. I'm not saying you should endure abuse, but learning what can satisfy her cravings is invaluable. First, figure out if it's sweet, savory, or sour. Usually, it's one of the first 2. Then, narrow it down. Chocolate or fruit. Red meat, white meat, noodles, or crunchy snacks. If it's sour, try pickles. Chances are, it's one of those.

Thats what you were already doing tho? You already weren't communicating, so now you are... Also not communicating? Lol", "Yea, it's so crazy how perfectly capable women turn into these helpless, entitled children. It would make sense if pregnancy caused people to be cronically tired and sore and also mess with their hormones in ways that make it more difficult to focus and do basic tasks. If they had huge mobility restrictions and constant discomfort, it would make sense to make accomodations and give them extra support, but we all know those things never happen to pregnant women. Probably, they're just assholes.", "I agree with you that OP is NTA and she has no right to treat him like a servant, but pregnancy can for sure be debilitating for many women.

However, I don't treat other people like shit because of it like OP's wife seems to!", "Based on OPs responses it sounds like his wife's usual diet is not sustaining her while pregnant. It's just not enough nutritionally and that's probably why she can't communicate what she needs. Her body is craving more, but she doesn't know what it needs, and after going through all of the nausea for so long, she's probably exhausted overthinking about food and nutrition.

Yogurt and cereal maybe? \n\nSome snacks are not filling at all: tea, watermelon so you should maybe not count them as real snacks.", "Why would a pregnant person still have a small appetite? She won't need double the food, but certainly more food than her normal serving because some of her energy is going towards the baby. Have you spoken to your doctor about meal ideas? Is she taking any vitamins? \n\nSome of this can be solved by adding just a bit more. Especially at breakfast. Like adding a banana to her cereal. Or even switching from a cold cereal to a warm one. You occasionally have eggs for breakfast, but she might need to start eating one most days and even having a bit of meat at breakfast, too. The protein will help her feel fuller longer than carbs will.\n\nThis does not mean that you have to do all of the cooking. You have got to get her used to helping out more, but she might need energy to do that. So getting her back used to helping out just after she has eaten could be your best bet. She could prep a variety of snacks when she has the energy to do so. \n\nSince you two have been eating so simply, she may be craving more elaborate meals without knowing it. She may crave an omelet with ham, cheese, and bell peppers. She may crave a greasy hamburger. That doesn't mean you need to make/run out to get it.

Make your best guess about what she needs using the commenter's advice above. Don't ask her what she wants, just make something like a grilled cheese sandwich or chicken soup once.

This is what we do in my family when someone's sick and is feeling like nothing's good enough to eat.", "I agree it doesn't sound filling. I think she needs a lot more nutrient dense foods, more protein, and healthy fats. Fats are very important - try adding avocado, olives and olive oil, more nuts, and fatty fish like salmon. Eggs more often too.\n\nShe also probably needs a lot more micronutrients that we don't eat a lot of normally, like zinc. Liver and oysters are excellent for this, though they aren't everyone's favorite, they are extremely nutrient dense. Try some pate that she can snack on with crackers, and there are some good tapenade or dip recipes using oysters that are pretty good if you don't usually like them. I can't stand them myself, EXCEPT in a dip with other strong flavors. I like it that way and it's very snacking friendly as well", "I\u2019m eating like 3-6 eggs a day at least and all I crave is meat, cheese, milk, and eggs. Only once have I craved a salad.
