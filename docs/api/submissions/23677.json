I (16M at the time) kept insisting that my sister(11F) and I,didn't want to associate with someone like his girlfriend who was a homewrecker. I was willing to keep contact with him solely for the fact he is my father since I despise people who cheat, with the condition that he didn't try to force a relationship between me and his girlfriend. But with all the bs he did during the separation(cheated, stole money from my grandma who lived with us, tried to claim part of my grandma's house saying he also lived there for so long so he deserved a part of it, and other crap) I was this close to just straight up knock him out (I was shorter but significantly stronger than my dad).\n\n\r  \nOff the start he already made his side of the family think ill of my mother telling lies about the situation and how my mom was manipulating us into no talking to him, when she actually did the oposite since her father died when she was a teen and didn't want us to live without one. The last straw for me was when he made my cousin choose between my mom, who was one of the closest people to his sister's children, even godmother to one of then, or him. My mom didn't feel confortable beeing in the same place as homewrecker, so she asked if they could ask him to not take her to my cousin wedding. Dad said it was either he and girlfriend or my mom since he wanted her to go (note that at that point they were like 3 months in their relationship). That was when I started ghosting him.\r  \nMy sister during all this still tried to keep in contact with him since they were closer, but he kept trying to manipulate the situation so his girlfriend would meet with my sister. My sister grew distance from him, and from his lack of trying to contact it seamed he didn't care.\r  \nHe did try to contact me once every few months for getting some fast food and talk about how things are going,but as years passed he acted more and more like an entitled teenager, never taking accountability for his actions and acting like the victim trying to guilt trip me. The conversation aways ended up into how I should help him out with my mom so she stopped demanding child support, wich he actually never paid for me, only paid for my sisters school for some time and into high school stopped paying entirelly. In fact, he went behind our backs and got our goverment assistance during the pandemic without our knowledge using my sisters and mine data.\n\n\r  \nNow that the cops are after him from all of my sisters unpaid child support he is desperate and trying to victimize himself so people pity him but no-one bought his story.\n\n\r  \nHe reached out to me last month in my 23rd birthday and after I refused to say where my workplace was he started asking why I don't care about him anymore and don't keep in contact nor try to help him in his situation. So I just ghosted him.\r  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690912382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fjnw8/aita_for_not_helping_my_father_now_that_hes/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
