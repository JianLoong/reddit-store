{"id": 4039, "submission_id": "zdlgji", "title": "AITA for telling my dad's wife I own the house she lives in?", "selftext": "My (29F) dad married a woman named Maria a year ago after dating for 4 years. My dad wanted to buy a larger house for them to live in, but couldn't afford it without selling the home he lived in at the time, which is a unique property that he dearly loves. Although I now live abroad, I like the area he lives in and my husband offered to buy a house there that my dad and Maria could live in. My dad agreed to this on the proviso that we not tell Maria that it wasn't him who paid for the house. This made no difference to me so I agreed and the house they live in is in my name, and they live there. I never planned to tell her.\n\nRecently, I went back to my home country and decided to stay with my dad for half my time there. The whole time, Maria made it clear I was an inconvenience and that me doing things with my dad was annoying to her, but I'm not a confrontational person, and I don't react to much, so I let it go. However, two days before I was due to leave, she came into my room and saw that I had my dad's dog on the bed. Now, this is a dog that my dad has had since before he met Maria and that I raised. Maria doesn't allow him on her bed which is fine, but I've always had him sleep on mine. She flipped out, saying this was the final straw, that she'd had enough of me disrespecting her in her own home, and I had to leave.\n\nI tried to de-escalate the situation, saying we should just wait for my dad and sit down and talk this out, but she was adamant that I had to leave and that she had the authority to make me. After several minutes of me trying to explain to her that it was absurd of her to try and kick me out of my dad's house without talking to him, she said that what she said went and since she married my dad this is technically her house. I just chuckled and said since my name is on the deed, it's technically my house, but there's no need to get technical, we should just wait for my dad. She was shocked, and left the room. When my dad came back, I told him what happened, and he went to speak to her. There was a shouting match, and she didn't speak to either of us until I left two days later.\n\nMy dad is mad I told her, which I get, but since then I've also got texts from her kids saying I was the AH for telling her and making her feel like a guest in the house. This isn't the case, she isn't a guest, she's a tenant, but so is my DAD and the only point I was trying to make was that she didn't have any business trying to kick me out of my father's house, let alone my own property. I didn't take it there until she did. That said, maybe I should have just left the ownership out and let my dad handle it?\n\nEDIT: For everyone talking about Maria being a tenant and tenant's rights. She doesn't pay rent, so I don't know if that makes her a tenant, technically. If it does, then as a landlord I'm pretty sure I have legal recourse over the remodelling she did without notifying me or my approval. And anyway, I wasn't there as a landlord, I was there as a guest of another \"tenant\", and actually she did have several weeks notice I was coming in any case. I'm sure it's a legal rabbit hole, but the only reason I used the word 'tenant' is to say that since she lives there she isn't a guest in the home.", "created_utc": 1670277850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdlgji/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_i_own_the_house_she/", "score": 6598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Puts you in an interesting pickle. I'd say that legally its a gray area for her to kick you out (or not); as she probably doesn't have a lease but she also has \"squatters rights\" or the equivalent.

To pull the landlord card is not only awful and demeaning *and* breaking your word to your dad, it also completely ignores the fact that you're there *as a guest*.  Since your dad wasn't present and the sole resident who *was* present asked you to leave, you should absolutely have left at once.\n\nThe best thing would be to call your dad and, if he didn't answer, leave the house temporarily and wait to work things out with him or let him handle it completely.

You shouldn't be forced to stay in a house with someone acting like an ass who makes you feel unwelcome, and she shouldn't be forced to have a guest she doesn't want there, either.  It's her home too.

It doesn\u2019t matter that you previously let the dog sleep with you, the current rules are that dogs don\u2019t get on the bed and you should have respected that.

It\u2019s not impossible but it\u2019s much easier to teach them they aren\u2019t allowed on any beds or furniture.

It comes down to what is your \"home country\" where the house is own and the laws there. Here in the USA, it would be that she is not a tenant, but a resident. She has rights as living there, but not the same. You would still have to care for the property as the owner, while you have people living there. Renting or not. You can be a tenant and a resident, but you have to be a lease holder. Otherwise it would be the same if you lived there and they lived with you.\n\nIf you want her out, here int he USA, you would have to give her a 30 day notice to leave first.

It seems a lot insane to me to be marrying in say your 50/60+ with children from prior relationships on both sides and no one had the conversation of: these are the assets I am bringing to this relationship, this we can use while alive but this over here will be just for MY kids.\n\n Also who at that age expects to have ownership and inheritance after a year of marriage especially without investing significant money of their own? She should have had her own retirement savings etc set up long before they even got together.", "It's temporary/conditional for the first two years, then becomes PR. Once you get PR, it's permanent. It doesn't matter if you break up at that point.", "It sounds like she\u2019s a SAHP not a lady of leisure. There\u2019s some sweat equity in that. But for sure she is behaving terribly and her treatment of OP should not be excused at all. I do understand that finding out it wasn\u2019t her and her husband\u2019s house would\u2019ve been quite a shock though. That\u2019s on OP\u2019s dad though."]}
