{"id": 4039, "submission_id": "zdlgji", "title": "AITA for telling my dad's wife I own the house she lives in?", "selftext": "My (29F) dad married a woman named Maria a year ago after dating for 4 years. My dad wanted to buy a larger house for them to live in, but couldn't afford it without selling the home he lived in at the time, which is a unique property that he dearly loves. Although I now live abroad, I like the area he lives in and my husband offered to buy a house there that my dad and Maria could live in. My dad agreed to this on the proviso that we not tell Maria that it wasn't him who paid for the house. This made no difference to me so I agreed and the house they live in is in my name, and they live there. I never planned to tell her.\n\nRecently, I went back to my home country and decided to stay with my dad for half my time there. The whole time, Maria made it clear I was an inconvenience and that me doing things with my dad was annoying to her, but I'm not a confrontational person, and I don't react to much, so I let it go. However, two days before I was due to leave, she came into my room and saw that I had my dad's dog on the bed. Now, this is a dog that my dad has had since before he met Maria and that I raised. Maria doesn't allow him on her bed which is fine, but I've always had him sleep on mine. She flipped out, saying this was the final straw, that she'd had enough of me disrespecting her in her own home, and I had to leave.\n\nI tried to de-escalate the situation, saying we should just wait for my dad and sit down and talk this out, but she was adamant that I had to leave and that she had the authority to make me. After several minutes of me trying to explain to her that it was absurd of her to try and kick me out of my dad's house without talking to him, she said that what she said went and since she married my dad this is technically her house. I just chuckled and said since my name is on the deed, it's technically my house, but there's no need to get technical, we should just wait for my dad. She was shocked, and left the room. When my dad came back, I told him what happened, and he went to speak to her. There was a shouting match, and she didn't speak to either of us until I left two days later.\n\nMy dad is mad I told her, which I get, but since then I've also got texts from her kids saying I was the AH for telling her and making her feel like a guest in the house. This isn't the case, she isn't a guest, she's a tenant, but so is my DAD and the only point I was trying to make was that she didn't have any business trying to kick me out of my father's house, let alone my own property. I didn't take it there until she did. That said, maybe I should have just left the ownership out and let my dad handle it?\n\nEDIT: For everyone talking about Maria being a tenant and tenant's rights. She doesn't pay rent, so I don't know if that makes her a tenant, technically. If it does, then as a landlord I'm pretty sure I have legal recourse over the remodelling she did without notifying me or my approval. And anyway, I wasn't there as a landlord, I was there as a guest of another \"tenant\", and actually she did have several weeks notice I was coming in any case. I'm sure it's a legal rabbit hole, but the only reason I used the word 'tenant' is to say that since she lives there she isn't a guest in the home.", "created_utc": 1670277850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdlgji/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_i_own_the_house_she/", "score": 1393, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Puts you in an interesting pickle. I'd say that legally its a gray area for her to kick you out (or not); as she probably doesn't have a lease but she also has \"squatters rights\" or the equivalent.

To pull the landlord card is not only awful and demeaning *and* breaking your word to your dad, it also completely ignores the fact that you're there *as a guest*.  Since your dad wasn't present and the sole resident who *was* present asked you to leave, you should absolutely have left at once.\n\nThe best thing would be to call your dad and, if he didn't answer, leave the house temporarily and wait to work things out with him or let him handle it completely.

You shouldn't be forced to stay in a house with someone acting like an ass who makes you feel unwelcome, and she shouldn't be forced to have a guest she doesn't want there, either.  It's her home too.

My comment was regarding the legal right of tenants and landlord.", "that never was her intention so i dont know why you bring it up. it evident that the step mother try to show that she was the new sherrif in that family and that the daughter should know her place and op return the situation to put her in her place", "That depends on the law regarding premarital assets.", "I get staying out of other people\u2019s relationships as much as possible,  but in this case, it\u2019s *entirely* her business, as they\u2019re living in *her* house, but only one of them knows it!", "Link?", ">I'm not sure tenant's rights apply if you don't pay rent\n\nTenants rights ABSOLUTELY apply even if you do pay rent.\n\n>so do landlord's rights, and she did heavy redecoration/construction in the house without notifying me which as a tenant, she can't do.\n\nShe got tenants rights by being a sub-let permitted by your tenant; your father.

Makes no sense why he couldn't just be honest instead of just assuming what she was or wasn't ok with. the easiest way to find out is to ask, but he chose to deceive her instead. That's a healthy relationship right there.", "I don't know if she thinks he bought it outright or if she thinks he took on a mortgage on his own (pretty sure you can do that in the UK).

This is not legally accurate.", "Okay. But, it's not like they're paying rent, and she's doing it for her dad. The only way could see it being an issue is the concern over something happening to him and her being unaware.. and honestly I'm a bit baffled on how she is so clueless? Either they would have both been required to fill out information to buy the house - or he could choose who inherited it and it might not have gone to her anyways.

Can't she even declare squatters rights depending on where they live? How was she supposed to know this was not her house? The fact that she is an unpleasant person as nothing to do with the question here.", "That may be a bit much. As a guest in the home Maria\u2019s lived in for years, you should be considerate of her too.

Can't she even declare squatters rights depending on where they live? \n\nNo. Reddit has a painfully poor understanding of what squatting is. She has permission to be there, the owner knows she's there, she's not a squatter. She likely has legal tenancy, though, regardless of not paying rent. \n\nAll of that is kind of moot, though. This isn't a subreddit for debating legality. She can be a legal tenant while still being an asshole for trying to unilaterally boot OP.", "Well, it's not that if he'd said she was upset that I would have been like, well I don't care blah blah. It's more, he said it's fine, I'm taking that at face value. If other conversations have happened behind the scenes, that's between them. It's kind of a, what people say about me behind my back is not my business, thing.", ">She clearly dislikes her MIL and it's absurd to say she hadn't developed an opinion of her after *four years*.\n\nI'm sorry it's unfathomable to you that a 29year old (who lives overseas) has no interest in forming a relationship with her father's wife (no idea where you got MIL from unless you're projecting...) and therefore is genuinely indifferent to them. Not sure why this is bothering you so much.\n\nAt 25, especially if her bio mom is still in the picture, there's zero reason to for a relationship with daddy's girlfriend..."]}
