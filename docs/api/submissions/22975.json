My daughter has not picked up any of my or my husband's calls over this. Were we wrong to have handled it this way.\n\nMy daughter Amy (24F) graduated university a couple years ago and has had several part-time jobs since then. She would work for a few months, quit and look for another job which has better pay. At the end of last year, she asked if she could move in with us (both in our 40s) so she could save money and look for a job in the field she graduated in. That sounded good to us so we agreed. We did not expect any kind of rent or money from her at the time, simply that she would find a job.\n\nHowever, it's almost August and she has not found a job yet. We asked about her job hunt and she said she was still looking and has not had any offers post-interview. I feel tricked and lied to because surely she would have found a job by now, it's been months. She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here. Her field is one that is looking for more women to join the workforce. She has been living here for months to essentially do nothing.\n\nSo, I talked with my husband and we both agreed it would be best for her to live with her aunt/my husband's sister as she works in the same industry as the one my daughter graduated in. Maybe she could learn some things that will help her get a job quicker. We then told Amy that she needed to move out to her aunt's while she looks for a job because it's clear she isn't doing enough here and her aunt could help. She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs. She said nothing and packed her bags and left.\n\nWe tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us. Instead, she sent us a spreadsheet/tracker of sorts which detailed job roles, application links, dates and stages of application where multiple said interview. I immediately felt guilty and tried to call her again. She will not pickup and her aunt sent my husband a text asking us to respect Amy's privacy while she stays with her. Were we assholes here?

I guess I must have skipped over it. Could you point me to where in your post you described the general communication process between you/husband and your daughter?", "YTA. She's a new graduate trying to find a job in a field that is notorious for being heavily male dominated. It's very hard looking for work these days and the competition is fierce, especially for someone who is new to the workforce and who doesn't have the years of experience so many companies require. \n\nAll you did was make your daughter feel like a failure and piled even more stress onto her by pulling the rug out from under her. No wonder she's not taking your calls, and I wouldn't expect her to do so for quite awhile.", "YTA\n\nUnless she\u2019s been a habitual liar, you had no reason to not trust her. She brought out the evidence to show you that she has been trying, and you rightfully should be feeling shame. \n\nAs you said, her aunt is more knowledgeable about your daughter\u2019s field than you. You should have first ask your daughter if she\u2019s talked to her aunt for advice about the field. \n\nInstead you choose a path that made her feel as if you 1) either don\u2019t trust her, or have confidence in her and 2) that you don\u2019t fully have her back.", "YTA - you tried to do what was best for you, not for your daughter. It is very difficult for young people to find good employment these days. The world has changed quite a lot since you were young (did you vote for those changes?) and life is significantly harder for young people than it was 20-30 years ago.. Rather than have empathy and support your daughter, you chose the role of authoritarian. It will likely be a while before you hear from her again.", "YTA.  You both made a lot of assumptions about her job search and kicked her out without even asking about the actual job search.  Unfortunately, if she hasn't found full-time work two years after graduating, despite a regular search, there is a critical issue.  \n\nSome possibilities - low degree GPA (weeds out a lot of people), no relevant experience in summer or term jobs during her degree, applying to jobs she isn't qualified for, not being open to relocation, interview problems, or unreasonable salary expectations.", "YTA.

You don\u2019t know what your daughters degree is? You had no idea your daughter is looking for a job? Sounds like mom and dad haven\u2019t spoken with the daughter at all, why not?

Then you found out that she was telling the truth and HAS been, in fact, trying to get a job. \n\nFrom comments it seems that your daughter studied engineering. Those kinds of jobs can be hard to land after interviews. My own father is a civil engineer, and after his previous company folded, it took him almost a year to get a new job. Jobs take time. \n\nAlso- I can speak from my current perspective. I recently finished my Master's degree, and while I've had a part-time job for a while, I've been struggling to land a solid full-time position with benefits that will utilize my skills and education. It's HARD. The job market is SATURATED. And while I live with a roommate and not my parents, I simply can't imagine how it would feel for my parents to shrug their shoulders and decide I'm \"not trying hard enough\" just because I haven't gotten a job yet. It's disappointing enough when I get the dreaded email after my interview that I haven't gotten the position; nobody needs extra shame from their parents.", "YTA mama. Because your daughter is not externally exhibiting what your expectations of what it looks like to look for a job, and her work cycles don\u2019t match what you expect, you kick her out?\n\nI\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, and I swear a majority of the people I know approaching 50+ or who aren\u2019t tech savvy, have no idea of current business processes and just assume you\u2019re doing nothing but staring at a toy (computer/tablet) all day, when it\u2019s an essential tool for just about everything. You know what they say about AssUMe, right?", "Yta it's not easy to get a job these days, let  alone that can support you, your a terrible parent", "There are several things going on here:\n\nFirst, the job market is horrible in some fields.  Many tech companies have had massive layoffs of highly qualified people who are flooding the market.  There are layoffs across fields.   \n Many skilled jobs have hundreds and hundreds of experienced applicants (thank you internet), and some ads for jobs aren't real as the company's real plan is to hire from within.\n\nSo it's possible that your daughter has genuinely been applying for jobs endlessly, going to interviews, and then being ghosted.\n\nThat said, your daughter isn't working.  At all.  There is no reason whatsoever than she can't continue to work part-time while job hunting.  Applying for jobs isn't full-time work.  So there's a problem there.\n\nAssuming your daughter has genuinely been trying like crazy to get a job but has been rebuffed over and over, she is probably pretty demoralized.  It also seems as if you don't trust her, and that's probably pretty upsetting for her as well.\n\nYou might want to help her by finding her a coach who can look at her CV and her cover letters and help her with her interviewing skills.  The problem might lie not in her professional competence, but in her job-seeking skills.  \n\nBut you sound entirely unsympathetic to what might be a dismal job market in her field or to an unrecognized deficit in job-hunting skills.  \n\nYour assumption that your daughter wasn't really job hunting hard enough and didn't deserve to be at home may well be baseless.  And if you'd wanted her to contribute to the household financially while job-hunting, how about telling her so she could have gotten the PT job as she offered to do when you threw her out?\n\nI think that you might be very deep into the wrong here, and that in all likelihood YTA", "YTA, I have a bunch of friends myself who have college degrees, but still cannot find a job in their respective field. It\u2019s tough out there and you just made it 10x worse. Instead of talking with your daughter about why it was taking so long and expressing concern, you decided that she was lying. As a daughter, I understand why she isn\u2019t responding to you.", "When my daughter graduated from college she spent 8 hours a day on her job search for a job in her field. (With a high gpa from an excellent school, a great resume with multiple internships, and excellent recommendations).\n\nApprox 1 out of every 150 applications bothered to get back to her at all. Of those, she got 7 interviews, one of which eventually led to a job (after a 3 month interview process). In her field but not at a living wage. The process took 10+ months.\n\nThere is a disconnect in the market. Companies do not have people dedicated to hiring (HR has replaced Personnel). Applications are through web apps that may or may not refer you to jobs that have anything to do with your skills or backgrounds. Companies are complaining that they never see resumes of good applicants while being inundated with resumes that are not a match. Without excellent SEO, applicants cannot get their resumes read by anyone who is actually hiring.\n\nTLDR: times have changed OP, and YTA.", "YTA\n\na few months from now, you're going to be lamenting how your daughter has gone no contact with you.\n\nThen complain you have no idea *why*.", "YTA - never kick out your child, not unless they did something unforgivable and serious", "Honestly, the job market is not what people seem to think it is.my brother graduated from his program a year ago and has applied to hundreds of jobs. Started with only applying in his field, but has been applying to everything and anything at this point. A few interviews and that's it. No job offers whatsoever. \n\nYou didn't even give her a heads up or try to help her. Just kicked her out to her aunt's place. YTA", "What's the goal?\n\nI honestly would like an answer. For her to be working in her field vs random jobs? For her to learn.....what?\n\nWhat's the goal, genuinely?\n\nI don't ever see myself kicking my sons out (except violence, theft, drugs and abuse). But, as a reasonable person who likes her children, why would I want them to leave? Does she make messes everywhere? Does she shove progressive opinions you hate in your face? I don't get it. Why do you even want her gone?\n\nYTA", "The job market is rough out there. So many organizations have had significant layoffs over the last year. And, yes, it has absolutely hit engineers. It really doesn\u2019t matter that she is a woman. You mention that you haven\u2019t even asked her a out her job search. Just to give you perspective. My husband was laid off in December. He has submitted his resume for close to 100 jobs. He has come close to an offer on three jobs but was the runner up. It sucks. It\u2019s demoralizing. And this is a man who has a couple of decades of experience, tons of contacts in his field, good severance, and career counseling services (his company outsourced an entire division so they were actually pretty generous with the packages). But while the job market might sound hot in only is in some spaces and really isn\u2019t right now. YTA.", "So your daughter was getting invites to interviews, and you didn't know? You didn't see her working on her applications, preparing for interviews, getting disappointed when she yet again was unsuccessful? And rather than ask her - at any time during the 6+ months - how things were going in her search, ask if she wanted your SIL's help/advice about job opportunities in her preferred field and/or ask if she wanted your help to do a mock interview with you guys as preparation for when you got to interview stage, you instead told her you thought it would be best to move into her aunt's place?\n\nIs Amy normally reserved, or did she have reason to think she couldn't confide in you in how the job hunt was going?\n\nAnd why didn't you consider inviting your SIL to dinner to kick start a conversation involving Amy about opportunities in Amy's preferred field, rather than jumping straight to kicking her out? \n\nFor the lack of communication and consideration before you kicked her out, YTA.\n\nHaving said that, I can't imagine Amy has been doing herself any favours not working all this year. For recruiters/employers looking at work history, a lack of recent employment in any field would not appear favourable. They might not be able to ask the reason for a gap, but it could still give them pause. Depending on the exact field of interest, finding work through a recruitment agency could have been a good route for Amy, giving her a foot in the door with a company ready for when other opportunities arose, or if not an 'in' at least an income whilst remaining flexible enough for the job hunt.", "YTA, you need to support her through this tough time. Perhaps do practice interviews, check in on how the job search process is going, talk to her before taking this drastic action of kicking her out.", "YTA.  And parenting doesn\u2019t stop at 18, just government requirements do.\n\nIt is very common for kids not to get jobs in their field with only a Bachelor\u2019s degree.", "YTA. You're completely out of touch with the reality of job hunting at the moment. Go check out a couple of the subreddits like antiwork resumehelp or careerguidance. You'll see that people are submitting hundreds of resumes to get maybe 5 interviews. Your daughter is struggling to find a job and you kicked her out. Don't expect to hear from her any time soon.", "Yta so instead of asking where she applied, you just assumed she lied?\n\nYou feel guilty and you *should* bc you acted badly.", "YTA\n\n>She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here.\n\nI'm a recent STEM graduate as well (pre-med biology). Finding a job in your desired field is harder than you 'assume'. \n\nEmployers expect applicants to have 5 or more years of experience, but experience gained during undergrad years (4+) don't count and at the same time be young/healthy enough to perform certain duties such as standing for long periods of time or be able to be in front of a computer screen for hours on end, to name a few.\n\n>She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs.\n\nDespite only working part-time jobs, she still tried to compromise and offered to contribute to bills.

The aunt understands what she's going through and probably went through the samething, which is why she was so open to allowing her to live with her. Hopefully, she can help her get in foot in the door to her desired profession. \n\n>We tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us.\n\nLeave your daughter TF alone!

Maybe her field is saturated at the moment. We can\u2019t know and that makes your argument difficult to judge.\n\n(EDIT: OP clarified that the field is engineering. Many subfields of engineering are saturated at the moment, so it\u2019s still hard to say in my opinion. I can see why OP is assuming she should be in high demand right now, but that really may not be the case if good engineers in her field are a dime a dozen.)\n\nDo know that it\u2019s hard for a lot of people to find jobs these days and that is an issue that has continued since the beginning of the pandemic. IMO, the issue in your circumstance is that she has no job at all and is not contributing. At first you had no issue with this, but it seems that now you do. That\u2019s fair, but it\u2019s not fair to assume she hasn\u2019t been doing everything she can.

I moved in with my boyfriend and I was unable to find a job for 6 months. Not even fast food would hire me, I\u2019m educated, I had the work experience, but no one would hire me. The same is true for a lot of young people I know. Jobs just aren\u2019t the same as they were, even during Covid I had no problem landing a job. You made a false assumption based on her not being able to find a job, and instead of trying to help her, compromise with her or anything, you just kick her to the curb.", "YTA. This whole thing reads like you hate your daughter. And FWIW, it took me almost exactly one year to the date after getting a masters degree to get a job offer. I was in the worst depression of my life, and my mother treated me like I was a bum or something, because a certain generation seems to think jobs are guaranteed to college grads. In actuality, job searching is hard as hell, in more ways than you probably understand.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s a very good chance she needed the nudge, but don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t kick her out. \n\nYTA for being flaky.

Job hunting and working are stressful enough as it is, having your parents make you feel like shit on top of it really, really doesnt help.\n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s experience, but your assumption that she isn\u2019t doing enough and isn\u2019t talking to you in detail about what she\u2019s been doing (especially now that it\u2019s clear she HAS been working to find a job) suggests to me that there are issues between you predating this, even if you likely dont realize it. And either way, you seem delusional about your role as parents, shipping her off to her aunt (??), and how fucking awful the job market is especially if you want to find a livable wage.

We did not expect any kind of rent or money from her at the time, simply that she would find a job.\n\nHowever, it's almost August and she has not found a job yet. We asked about her job hunt and she said she was still looking and has not had any offers post-interview. I feel tricked and lied to because surely she would have found a job by now, it's been months. She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here. Her field is one that is looking for more women to join the workforce. She has been living here for months to essentially do nothing.\n\nSo, I talked with my husband and we both agreed it would be best for her to live with her aunt/my husband's sister as she works in the same industry as the one my daughter graduated in. Maybe she could learn some things that will help her get a job quicker. We then told Amy that she needed to move out to her aunt's while she looks for a job because it's clear she isn't doing enough here and her aunt could help. She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs. She said nothing and packed her bags and left.\n\nWe tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us. Instead, she sent us a spreadsheet/tracker of sorts which detailed job roles, application links, dates and stages of application where multiple said interview. I immediately felt guilty and tried to call her again. She will not pickup and her aunt sent my husband a text asking us to respect Amy's privacy while she stays with her. Were we assholes here?

Most engineering positions are not externally advertised, and are difficult to even apply to. Not to mention, on top of the lengthy job search, the interviews are typically more rigorous.

And some of the possibilities you mentioned are legit obstacles, like relocation, but entry level of salary is what's stopping her, that's on her. She needs to take whatever she can get and use that experience to launch into better jobs. If she's only cherry picking the high end stuff she hadn't earned the right to be in yet, then OP is not the AH.\n\nThat said, kinda feels like OP jumped straight to kicking her out. I think at 3 months, they should have sat her down, made it clear this arrangement only works if she's looking as hard as she can for work. They'd then should have been able to ask her what jobs she applied for, what interviews etc. I'd also be checking jobs apps to look for work in her field, then ask if she's applied for those and if not, why not. If she's not putting effort in looking at work, then it's time to move her out", "Not to mention it's your goddamn daughter, who has a kid just too throw them out onto the street???", "So\u2026 as someone who is currently laid off and also might have to go back to my parents, I think a lot of people are babying the daughter. \n\nLike you said, she\u2019s not working at all.

Yes the job market is shit, but sometimes you just HAVE to do what you have to do to make something work. \n\nAlso, the SIL has always been there, in the same field. Not sure if they\u2019ve been in communication this whole time but I feel like the SIL would have spoken up on the daughters behalf before we got here if something was being done. Like that\u2019s a resource, that daughter could have used way before she was forced to move out. Sure, OP *could* pay for a coach, but the SIL is right there. And again, she\u2019s an adult that has had jobs that she quit on her own free will. At what point is the daughters destiny and career in her own hands and why should OP have to come out of her own pocket to get her a resume review when the daughter isn\u2019t even given her the courtesy of keeping her updated?? \n\nLike I know things are hard right now and maybe OP didn\u2019t communicate probably but I really feel like the daughter is not going about this well.

You don't know what you are talking about.", "Yea that\u2019s where I am. \n\nLike it does seem a little abrupt on OP\u2019s part but the daughter has a habit of quitting with no plan and I can see why OP doesn\u2019t want this to become permanent. If she can create a spreadsheet about her search she could certainly give her parents updates. And I do think it\u2019s on the daughter to communicate and not OP because the daughter is the one living rent free. OP shouldn\u2019t have to nag her about it. \n\nAnd like you said, even a part time job in the mean time is a good idea or something that might pay a little less but is in the right direction. The job market is hard but sometimes you have to take a step down to get to where you want to go and daughter should/could have used this to take a pay cut if she needed. OP only wanted her to get a job. She could\u2019ve used this time a bit more wisely IMO.", "You didn\u2019t hear anything because you didn\u2019t ask her.

She didn\u2019t spontaneously tell you about all her applications or how they went, so you assumed there were none. \n\nIn today\u2019s world, most job applications do not pan out. You hear nothing back at all. My own mother did exactly as you did, not just with job searches but with everything.

I started making jokes about how she lacked object permanence, completely unable to think of me as an individual who did things when she wasn\u2019t looking.

They want financial analysts AND a BA.  Or someone who know airline scheduling and can actually ANALYZE scheduling data and make actual business decisions instead of the BA /PM getting that info from someone who is actually qualified to do that type of analysis.\n\nIt\u2019s like asking a BA/PM to do risk assessment, decide on the new course of action (ie make risk assessment decisions instead of someone who, you know, is an actual expert in risk assessment), and THEN do the BA/PM job.\n\nIt\u2019s absurd.

If Indeed has an instant application, they're going to get hundreds or thousands of applications for a job they previously might have gotten a few dozen for. So they add algorithms that scan for keywords, and now people have to start cramming resumes with keywords, and their application is never seen by a human eyeball if they guess the wrong ones.\n\nThey have more options, so they're more likely to get the perfect employee for cheap, when previously they would have taken the 7/10 who asked for more money. So now everyone is competing against better applicants AND people willing to work for less. Then every office realized they can cut their rent in half at a smaller office with WFH, so you're up against people who aren't local or willing to relocate, and never would have applied in 2018. Hell, maybe they're in a significantly lower cost of living area, so the company can get away with paying even less now (why pay an employee enough to afford NYC rent, when you can pay someone enough for rural Missouri rent and fly them to JFK twice a year if necessary?).\n\nEverything's easier, so you can apply to 100 jobs with the work it used to take to apply to 10, but everything is harder so a 1/10 chance at getting the job is now 1/1000.

Pretty much what I\u2019ve concluded as well.", "I\u2019m betting cash money it\u2019s Civil Engineering, which is a notoriously difficult field for female engineers to find roles in compared to others.", "OP, Sadly with the job market as absurd as it is she probably won't be getting a very well paid job since even with 'entry' level they want experience outside of college.\n\nHowever there are some YouTube channels that make videos specialized in how to get hired. Take 'A life after lay off' for instance. They could provide good I formation to spruce up her resume and also how to interview well. That said in some industries it can also be very important as who you k ow so if you do know someone who works in the exact same field that could help her as well.\n\nBut please don't assume it's because she's being lazy alone. The job market is  bonkers too.", "They\u2019ll do the same amount of work, too.", "That\u2019s not true. Biden is older than boomer. He was born closer to the Lincoln presidency than his own.", "It\u2019s almost certainly compsci. I moved to my area in 2020 as a 24 y/o woman in compsci and it took me over 150 applications and 8 months of actively applying after I got off my current job to get the one I have now. The amount of interviews I got? One, and I took it. No response at all from the others. I can\u2019t imagine how much worse it is now.", "Since you guess right, may I ask why?", "Look, from the get go, most engineering roles have a sexist view within, even if the people inside the company aren't actively hating and avoiding hiring women, which happens, they will receive way more applications from men than women, since they are way more men and than women in the area, probably people that already are in the industry will try to get jobs for their buddies, that again even if they aren't woman haters they probably have more man friends in the same area than woman.  \nNow, I am not in the civil engineering area, but if Civil is even worse than women, probably what I listed is included but probably there are even more problems. Also, nowadays is hard getting a good job, even with a degree, the companies are asking graduates to have 10 years experience and specializations in different fields for entry level jobs", "Because it\u2019s a boys club and they\u2019re only looking for women on paper because it makes them sound better but the bosses many times are older men who hire the sons of their friends. Also unless she did lots of internships in college they can afford to be picky, and generally finding a job right now stinks no matter what field you\u2019re in.", "She did offer to help with bills and they still kicked her out\u2026", "\u2026 after they told her she had to go."]}
