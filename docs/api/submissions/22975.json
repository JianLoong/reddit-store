My daughter has not picked up any of my or my husband's calls over this. Were we wrong to have handled it this way.\n\nMy daughter Amy (24F) graduated university a couple years ago and has had several part-time jobs since then. She would work for a few months, quit and look for another job which has better pay. At the end of last year, she asked if she could move in with us (both in our 40s) so she could save money and look for a job in the field she graduated in. That sounded good to us so we agreed. We did not expect any kind of rent or money from her at the time, simply that she would find a job.\n\nHowever, it's almost August and she has not found a job yet. We asked about her job hunt and she said she was still looking and has not had any offers post-interview. I feel tricked and lied to because surely she would have found a job by now, it's been months. She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here. Her field is one that is looking for more women to join the workforce. She has been living here for months to essentially do nothing.\n\nSo, I talked with my husband and we both agreed it would be best for her to live with her aunt/my husband's sister as she works in the same industry as the one my daughter graduated in. Maybe she could learn some things that will help her get a job quicker. We then told Amy that she needed to move out to her aunt's while she looks for a job because it's clear she isn't doing enough here and her aunt could help. She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs. She said nothing and packed her bags and left.\n\nWe tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us. Instead, she sent us a spreadsheet/tracker of sorts which detailed job roles, application links, dates and stages of application where multiple said interview. I immediately felt guilty and tried to call her again. She will not pickup and her aunt sent my husband a text asking us to respect Amy's privacy while she stays with her. Were we assholes here?

She's a new graduate trying to find a job in a field that is notorious for being heavily male dominated.

She brought out the evidence to show you that she has been trying, and you rightfully should be feeling shame. \n\nAs you said, her aunt is more knowledgeable about your daughter\u2019s field than you. You should have first ask your daughter if she\u2019s talked to her aunt for advice about the field. \n\nInstead you choose a path that made her feel as if you 1) either don\u2019t trust her, or have confidence in her and 2) that you don\u2019t fully have her back.", "YTA - you tried to do what was best for you, not for your daughter. It is very difficult for young people to find good employment these days. The world has changed quite a lot since you were young (did you vote for those changes?) and life is significantly harder for young people than it was 20-30 years ago.. Rather than have empathy and support your daughter, you chose the role of authoritarian. It will likely be a while before you hear from her again.", "YTA.  You both made a lot of assumptions about her job search and kicked her out without even asking about the actual job search.  Unfortunately, if she hasn't found full-time work two years after graduating, despite a regular search, there is a critical issue.  \n\nSome possibilities - low degree GPA (weeds out a lot of people), no relevant experience in summer or term jobs during her degree, applying to jobs she isn't qualified for, not being open to relocation, interview problems, or unreasonable salary expectations.", "YTA.

Then you found out that she was telling the truth and HAS been, in fact, trying to get a job. \n\nFrom comments it seems that your daughter studied engineering. Those kinds of jobs can be hard to land after interviews. My own father is a civil engineer, and after his previous company folded, it took him almost a year to get a new job. Jobs take time. \n\nAlso- I can speak from my current perspective. I recently finished my Master's degree, and while I've had a part-time job for a while, I've been struggling to land a solid full-time position with benefits that will utilize my skills and education. It's HARD. The job market is SATURATED. And while I live with a roommate and not my parents, I simply can't imagine how it would feel for my parents to shrug their shoulders and decide I'm \"not trying hard enough\" just because I haven't gotten a job yet. It's disappointing enough when I get the dreaded email after my interview that I haven't gotten the position; nobody needs extra shame from their parents.", "YTA mama. Because your daughter is not externally exhibiting what your expectations of what it looks like to look for a job, and her work cycles don\u2019t match what you expect, you kick her out?\n\nI\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, and I swear a majority of the people I know approaching 50+ or who aren\u2019t tech savvy, have no idea of current business processes and just assume you\u2019re doing nothing but staring at a toy (computer/tablet) all day, when it\u2019s an essential tool for just about everything. You know what they say about AssUMe, right?", "Yta it's not easy to get a job these days, let  alone that can support you, your a terrible parent", "There are several things going on here:\n\nFirst, the job market is horrible in some fields.  Many tech companies have had massive layoffs of highly qualified people who are flooding the market.  There are layoffs across fields.   \n Many skilled jobs have hundreds and hundreds of experienced applicants (thank you internet), and some ads for jobs aren't real as the company's real plan is to hire from within.\n\nSo it's possible that your daughter has genuinely been applying for jobs endlessly, going to interviews, and then being ghosted.\n\nThat said, your daughter isn't working.  At all.  There is no reason whatsoever than she can't continue to work part-time while job hunting.  Applying for jobs isn't full-time work.  So there's a problem there.\n\nAssuming your daughter has genuinely been trying like crazy to get a job but has been rebuffed over and over, she is probably pretty demoralized.  It also seems as if you don't trust her, and that's probably pretty upsetting for her as well.\n\nYou might want to help her by finding her a coach who can look at her CV and her cover letters and help her with her interviewing skills.  The problem might lie not in her professional competence, but in her job-seeking skills.  \n\nBut you sound entirely unsympathetic to what might be a dismal job market in her field or to an unrecognized deficit in job-hunting skills.  \n\nYour assumption that your daughter wasn't really job hunting hard enough and didn't deserve to be at home may well be baseless.  And if you'd wanted her to contribute to the household financially while job-hunting, how about telling her so she could have gotten the PT job as she offered to do when you threw her out?\n\nI think that you might be very deep into the wrong here, and that in all likelihood YTA", "YTA, I have a bunch of friends myself who have college degrees, but still cannot find a job in their respective field. It\u2019s tough out there and you just made it 10x worse. Instead of talking with your daughter about why it was taking so long and expressing concern, you decided that she was lying. As a daughter, I understand why she isn\u2019t responding to you.", "When my daughter graduated from college she spent 8 hours a day on her job search for a job in her field. (With a high gpa from an excellent school, a great resume with multiple internships, and excellent recommendations).\n\nApprox 1 out of every 150 applications bothered to get back to her at all. Of those, she got 7 interviews, one of which eventually led to a job (after a 3 month interview process). In her field but not at a living wage. The process took 10+ months.\n\nThere is a disconnect in the market. Companies do not have people dedicated to hiring (HR has replaced Personnel). Applications are through web apps that may or may not refer you to jobs that have anything to do with your skills or backgrounds. Companies are complaining that they never see resumes of good applicants while being inundated with resumes that are not a match. Without excellent SEO, applicants cannot get their resumes read by anyone who is actually hiring.\n\nTLDR: times have changed OP, and YTA.", "YTA\n\na few months from now, you're going to be lamenting how your daughter has gone no contact with you.\n\nThen complain you have no idea *why*.", "YTA - never kick out your child, not unless they did something unforgivable and serious", "Honestly, the job market is not what people seem to think it is.my brother graduated from his program a year ago and has applied to hundreds of jobs. Started with only applying in his field, but has been applying to everything and anything at this point. A few interviews and that's it. No job offers whatsoever. \n\nYou didn't even give her a heads up or try to help her. Just kicked her out to her aunt's place. YTA", "What's the goal?\n\nI honestly would like an answer? For her to be working in her field vs random jobs? For her to learn.....what?\n\nWhat's the goal, genuinely?\n\nI don't ever see myself kicking my son's out (except violence, theft, drugs and abuse). But, as a reasonable person who likes her children, why would I want them to leave? Does she make messes everywhere? Does she shove progressive opinions you hate in your face? I don't get it. Why do you even want her gone?\n\nYTA", "The job market is rough out there. So many organizations have had significant layoffs over the last year. And, yes, it has absolutely hit engineers. It really doesn\u2019t matter that she is a woman. You mention that you haven\u2019t even asked her a out her job search. Just to give you perspective. My husband was laid off in December. He has submitted his resume for close to 100 jobs. He has come close to an offer on three jobs but was the runner up. It sucks. It\u2019s demoralizing. And this is a man who has a couple of decades of experience, tons of contacts in his field, good severance, and career counseling services (his company outsourced an entire division so they were actually pretty generous with the packages). But while the job market might sound hot in only is in some spaces and really isn\u2019t right now. YTA.", "So your daughter was getting invites to interviews, and you didn't know? You didn't see her working on her applications, preparing for interviews, getting disappointed when she yet again was unsuccessful? And rather than ask her - at any time during the 6+ months - how things were going in her search, ask if she wanted your SIL's help/advice about job opportunities in her preferred field and/or ask if she wanted your help to do a mock interview with you guys as preparation for when you got to interview stage, you instead told her you thought it would be best to move into her aunt's place?\n\nIs Amy normally reserved, or did she have reason to think she couldn't confide in you in how the job hunt was going?\n\nAnd why didn't you consider inviting your SIL to dinner to kick start a conversation involving Amy about opportunities in Amy's preferred field, rather than jumping straight to kicking her out? \n\nFor the lack of communication and consideration before you kicked her out, YTA.\n\nHaving said that, I can't imagine Amy has been doing herself any favours not working all this year. For recruiters/employers looking at work history, a lack of recent employment in any field would not appear favourable. They might not be able to ask the reason for a gap, but it could still give them pause. Depending on the exact field of interest, finding work through a recruitment agency could have been a good route for Amy, giving her a foot in the door with a company ready for when other opportunities arose, or if not an 'in' at least an income whilst remaining flexible enough for the job hunt.", "YTA, you need to support her through this tough time. Perhaps do practice interviews, check in on how the job search process is going, talk to her before taking this drastic action of kicking her out.", "YTA.  And parenting doesn\u2019t stop at 18, just government requirements do.\n\nIt is very common for kids not to get jobs in their field with only a Bachelor\u2019s degree.", "YTA. You're completely out of touch with the reality of job hunting at the moment. Go check out a couple of the subreddits like antiwork resumehelp or careerguidance. You'll see that people are submitting hundreds of resumes to get maybe 5 interviews. Your daughter is struggling to find a job and you kicked her out. Don't expect to hear from her any time soon.", "Yta so instead of asking where she applied, you just assumed she lied?\n\nYou feel guilty and you *should* bc you acted badly.", "YTA\n\n>She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here.\n\nI'm a recent STEM graduate as well (pre-med biology). Finding a job in your desired field is harder than you 'assume'. \n\nEmployers expect applicants to have 5 or more years of experience, but experience gained during undergrad years (4+) don't count and at the same time be young/healthy enough to perform certain duties such as standing for long periods of time or be able to be in front of a computer screen for hours on end, to name a few.\n\n>She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs.\n\nDespite only working part-time jobs, she still tried to compromise and offered to contribute to bills.

The aunt understands what she's going through and probably went through the samething, which is why she was so open to allowing her to live with her.

Maybe her field is saturated at the moment. We can\u2019t know and that makes your argument difficult to judge.\n\n(EDIT: OP clarified that the field is engineering. Many subfields of engineering are saturated at the moment, so it\u2019s still hard to say in my opinion. I can see why OP is assuming she should be in high demand right now, but that really may not be the case if good engineers in her field are a dime a dozen.)\n\nDo know that it\u2019s hard for a lot of people to find jobs these days and that is an issue that has continued since the beginning of the pandemic. IMO, the issue in your circumstance is that she has no job at all and is not contributing. At first you had no issue with this, but it seems that now you do. That\u2019s fair, but it\u2019s not fair to assume she hasn\u2019t been doing everything she can.

I moved in with my boyfriend and I was unable to find a job for 6 months. Not even fast food would hire me, I\u2019m educated, I had the work experience, but no one would hire me. The same is true for a lot of young people I know. Jobs just aren\u2019t the same as they were, even during Covid I had no problem landing a job. You made a false assumption based on her not being able to find a job, and instead of trying to help her, compromise with her or anything, you just kick her to the curb.", "YTA. This whole thing reads like you hate your daughter. And FWIW, it took me almost exactly one year to the date after getting a masters degree to get a job offer. I was in the worst depression of my life, and my mother treated me like I was a bum or something, because a certain generation seems to think jobs are guaranteed to college grads. In actuality, job searching is hard as hell, in more ways than you probably understand.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s a very good chance she needed the nudge, but don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t kick her out. \n\nYTA for being flaky.

Job hunting and working are stressful enough as it is, having your parents make you feel like shit on top of it really, really doesnt help.\n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s experience, but your assumption that she isn\u2019t doing enough and isn\u2019t talking to you in detail about what she\u2019s been doing (especially now that it\u2019s clear she HAS been working to find a job) suggests to me that there are issues between you predating this, even if you likely dont realize it. And either way, you seem delusional about your role as parents, shipping her off to her aunt (??), and how fucking awful the job market is especially if you want to find a livable wage.

We did not expect any kind of rent or money from her at the time, simply that she would find a job.\n\nHowever, it's almost August and she has not found a job yet. We asked about her job hunt and she said she was still looking and has not had any offers post-interview. I feel tricked and lied to because surely she would have found a job by now, it's been months. She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here. Her field is one that is looking for more women to join the workforce. She has been living here for months to essentially do nothing.\n\nSo, I talked with my husband and we both agreed it would be best for her to live with her aunt/my husband's sister as she works in the same industry as the one my daughter graduated in. Maybe she could learn some things that will help her get a job quicker. We then told Amy that she needed to move out to her aunt's while she looks for a job because it's clear she isn't doing enough here and her aunt could help. She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs. She said nothing and packed her bags and left.\n\nWe tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us. Instead, she sent us a spreadsheet/tracker of sorts which detailed job roles, application links, dates and stages of application where multiple said interview. I immediately felt guilty and tried to call her again. She will not pickup and her aunt sent my husband a text asking us to respect Amy's privacy while she stays with her. Were we assholes here? We tried doing what was best.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
