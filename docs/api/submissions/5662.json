You obviously are very aware of the wild amount of wealth you married into and how much it sets you apart. You say in a comment you \u2018realize how bad it is going to sound\u201d that your kids don\u2019t need a college fund. You know how much you spend on your kids each year for Christmas and since you make a point of mentioning your donations I am sure you know how much that amount of money would mean to a an average or low-income family. You knew what you were doing when you bought $4,000 worth of gifts for that girl, you just really wanted to do it. So you did. \n\nI grew up as an average family around a lot of incredibly wealthy families. The \u201cclueless rich\u201d bit gets pretty tiresome. You know perfectly well what you have, you know that it probably makes a lot of people uncomfortable when you spend lavishly around them, so stop pretending you don\u2019t. If you want to treat people to big gifts then ask them or their parents if they\u2019re comfortable with that - some will be and some won\u2019t. Be respectful of that.", "YTA you should definitely check with a parent before you spend that type of money in their child. They might not want their child to own or be responsible for something that expensive. I might have a different opinion if you were talking about a couple of hundred dollars but 4K is a lot of money to most people", "YTA\n\nThese kids are going to turn out fucked.", "Yes, you\u2019re the asshole.", "YTA for not checking with the mom ahead of time. \n\nOne because it can set a precedence for future holidays and birthdays...putting her parents in an impossible situation where they can't possibly meet her expectations, and two because they may not think their child is responsible enough to care for something so expensive. These are both important issues. \n\nImagine if you have given her these gifts before her own parents had given her their gifts. Now you have a child in letdown mode because you just set the stage for getting fabulous gifts and now she has to feign excitement when the gifts she gets afterwards are less than spectacular. \n\nNow imagine if something happens to the necklace or bag? Do you know how mortified and guilt ridden bother cousin and her mother would be? 14 year Olds who didn't grow up with expensive things aren't exactly known for being the most responsible.  I know I would be concerned if someone had gifted one of my daughters a $3000 necklace and $1000 bag when they were 14. Having to follow them around to make sure that the necklace was being returned to its case after wearing, having to take it in to be inspected all the time to maintain the warranty, and making sure they weren't using that $1000 bag to carry their lunch or putting it on the floor when they went places. \n\nYou're really out of touch with reality if you don't think anything of dropping thousands of dollars on a child without talking to their parents.", "This one was a bit tough for me as I have been the recipient in situations like this but my parents were fine with it, even when it was a surprise. \n\nFor example, my dad was a teacher and did a lot of tutoring for rich families in our town on the side. Some of those families became good friends of ours as well so these were family friends giving us gifts. We were not poverty-level poor but we lived in the worst house in a nice town with an excellent school district, and the mortgage on that shitty house was a stretch for my parents. We always struggled with money (and my brother and I certainly felt poor compared to our classmates) but our parents wanted us to be in this school district. \n\nI remember one of those families (turned into a good family friend) was really grateful for my dad's tutoring. And even though he was paid a very good rate to tutor their kid, they were super grateful that their kid did well on his SATs. They wanted to give my dad a bonus. My dad said it was unnecessary but because they kept insisting, he said that if they really wanted to, they could get me a little gift because I helped with the kid's SAT tutoring. I was actually a couple years younger but had nearly aced my SATs as a freshman (took them as practice for my PSATs bc I wanted to do well on those for scholarship purposes). To our surprise, they gifted me a Fendi bag. It was apparently an entry level bag so to them, it was \"small\" but of course we were totally surprised. \n\nMy parents could not afford to spend hundreds, much less over a thousand dollars on a gift for me. But they did recognize that our expectations were just different. A small gift to us was not the same as a small gift to them. That being said, they were mainly just happy for me. And I never thought less of them for not being able to afford nicer gifts. I actually mainly remember being concerned with money issues in high school because I didn't want them to overextend themselves. I worked an after school job to go to some nerdy summer camps and pay for tickets/expenses for school dances and such. I don't want to imply I was a great kid all the time or that they were always awesome parents. I fought a LOT with my dad growing up (he was controlling), but money was never an issue outside of my dad shaming me on \"overspending\" on his gifts once I had a full-time job after college (he grew up super poor during a civil war and had a lot of issues around financial insecurity). \n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying that I get it. You didn't think twice because your scale for normal is very different than your cousin's daughter's mother's expectations. I think it would have been nice to give her a heads up or talk to her first but ultimately it is a gift. And you can do what you want with your money. She can choose to see it as a nice surprise or take it as an insult, and I do think that's on her. It would have been nice to give a heads up but I don't think it's necessary so I'm leaning toward NTA with the potential for a very soft E S H for not checking in with her first. \n\nEdit: put the wrong soft judgment - changed to E S H but doesn't change my actual judgment.", "YTA and showing off because you married money.", "ESH. You bought a 14 year old $4k worth of gifts that you \u2018thought she might like\u2019? Her mom overreacted, for sure, but you need to think about the amount you\u2019re spending on people vs. their actual needs.", "Omg ESH. Spending $15k per child? Donating and being grateful is nice but your children are going to grow up to be materialistic, entitled monsters. You can see how it\u2019s already causing problems in the family. \n\nWhy not put some of that money into a college fund or trust FBO the kids? I\u2019m guessing that will have a more meaningful impact than a YSL bag that will be yesterday\u2019s news in a few weeks.", "NTA. \n\nI think you did a nice thing that was just a little extravagant and you unintentionally overshadowed her mother. \n\nI think her mother overreacted. It\u2019s not like you bought her a car or a puppy or something she needs to be responsible for.", "Esh maybe the mom overracted but spending 4k on a 14 year old is insane.", "Absolutely YTA.", "NTA. I don't know why you're getting shit on here. You were doing something nice for her.", "NTA\n\nThis boils down to your circumstances allowing for lavish gifts, even for early-teen children and how much that differs from most families. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ass for your generosity. I would say it can come across as\u2026out of touch? When so many families struggle to provide one gift, let alone $4k worth, it will naturally make people think that you\u2019ve lost the perspective on how $4k can change a person\u2019s life. \n\nI personally would have been ecstatic to have those gifts, but perhaps you could revisit how you\u2019re buying gifts. Set general limits on what you\u2019ll spend and make sure it\u2019s more reasonable if you don\u2019t \u201cclear\u201d a purchase with the parent. \n\nPut yourself in the parent\u2019s shoes. If you couldn\u2019t afford to spend that much, you\u2019d feel gut punched seeing your child light up and forget about everything you purchased for them because you just don\u2019t have the funds to buy lavishly. \n\nEven if finances aren\u2019t an issue, the parents could have issues with their child receiving an expensive gift like this and your gift crosses the line they want in place. \n\nYou could also just ask the parents if they have any sort of college fund or account set aside for their child that they contribute to.

Personally, I would be thrilled if someone would be able to buy my kids something I could not afford.", "no.  i plan on talking to her about everything and will consult her before i purchase anything else for her daughter in the future", "well some ppl are being a tad mean for a situation they\u2019re simply just not in and i never said i was misunderstood i just think some ppl are making me out to be malicious and i wasn\u2019t rly trying to be.  i have had a reality check bc i thought my cousins mum was completely overreacting initially as no one else in my family agreed with her.  and i know this kid very well.  she spends time with my daughter roughly once every two weeks and they\u2019re very close.", "i also just want to say that i was never going to let my children be little entitled shits.  i cringe when i see kids throw tantrums (after a certain age) for not getting what they want and have made sure my children never expect anything. and they don\u2019t. and they\u2019re so genuinely grateful for everything they get, which is honestly all i wanted.  i also regularly bring them to soup kitchens to help me volunteer and shelters where there are young kids.  we also dropped off lots of toys and gifts at charities for kids whose parents weren\u2019t going to be able to get them anything this year.  if i had gotten my kids a $20 toy each, they would have been happy with that and that\u2019s all that matters to me.  i just enjoy spoiling them because i am fortunate enough to be able to.", "haha you\u2019re all good.  thank you for the advice!", "thank you \u2764\ufe0f but i will make sure to check w her mum from now on because id hate to upset anyone else again", "yes! i agree! and i will be making sure to check in with her from now on as i truly never meant to upset her.", "If you read her other comments, she grew up rich but just married to a richer family. I doubt her family felt she was flaunting her wealth since they were also rich. Tbh most of these comments just reek of bitterness and jealousy", "username is made up by my kid as an inside joke where \u201crich\u201d means humorous, made this account today to ask as i don\u2019t want people connecting my posts and figuring out who i am as too many context clues could narrow it down, and idk what u mean by argumentative style.  assuming u mean the way i\u2019m writing, but it\u2019s because in all reality, other peoples opinions don\u2019t matter too much to me as it\u2019s the people closest to me who i need to care about.  i\u2019ll never know these people commenting so i\u2019m not majorly concerned", "Is there something wrong with being rich?????? I seriously am not understanding WHY the majority of comments here are negative.", "haha.  i genuinely went through what i wanted to buy my daughter and was like \u201coh my gosh\u201d when i saw and was scrambling to buy more stuff for the boys to try and make it even.  i was trying to explain that but i do see how it came across that way.  how can i brag if you guys don\u2019t know me and i\u2019m just anonymous her online? i don\u2019t think i was being generous by gifting my cousins daughter what i got her tbf just things i thought she\u2019d like, as i did with all of my cousins children (whose parents had no problem with their gifts.  \u201crichmammy\u201d is a reference to my then two year old calling everything i said \u201crich\u201d when he learned the word and he meant humorous.  if i made a joke he\u2019d say \u201cthat\u2019s rich mammy\u201d and i could say \u201cwe\u2019re having blah blah blah for dinner\u201d and he\u2019d go \u201cthat\u2019s rich mammy\u201d and it became a running joke w family and friends.", "i want them to be spoiled at christmas.  but still good kids, which they are definitely turning out to be.", "no. because it breaks my heart to think that there are children out there who won\u2019t wake up to gifts on christmas day.  so if i have spare money i don\u2019t need, why would i not give it to people who need it much more than me and my family? but you can think whatever you want", "Not one person had said you had malicious intentions and if that's what you heard then I think I see why you aren't understanding the original problem as well.", "awe thank you! yes they\u2019re quite close and i did get them the same ring and purse!", "I hate to tell you, that isn\u2019t upper middle class. That\u2019s straight upper class.", "You got two cars as a teenager??", "is this really considered to be upper middle class?!?! \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35", "You grew up rich.", "Your response doesn't make you sound better. It's very clear you don't know how you're perceived based on how you behave, by the rest of the world, based on your responses.\n\nYou first make yourself seem obtuse, then comment to explain your privilege as an excuse for being obtuse. However using the single mom analogy back at me in your response implies you DO have an understanding....which makes you worse, much worse.\n\nEither you do have a concept of gift giving or you don't. By giving gifts to an extended random family member that are brand name and more expensive than that person's nuclear family you made a financial statement to your extended family. It comes across as entitlement and bragging. Nothing more. Especially since you barely knew the teenager. How do you not know this as a functioning adult?", "What your explaining sounds like holding your children responsible for their actions ( ofc not including the toy be taken away) which is great but they sometimes deserve to be punished for things and not receiving expensive items or anything they don\u2019t NEED at all is normal / acceptable punishment. It\u2019s not some cruel and neglecting form of punishment", "interesting! i like this.. we never really put any guidelines around our gifts in our family but i like the educational aspect a lot!", "So much delusion in one post I don't even know where to begin.", "you need to chill out. all i was doing was correcting your sentence, because the comment did not say that getting your cousins daughter presents was going to corrupt her. but if this is how you act with your children (being ignorant) then yeah unless your partner is a saint your kids are screwed.", "Let me just warn you: Many of my classmates\u2019 parents had the same approach as you do and it didn\u2019t work. \n\nWhen you grow up being gifted the equivalent of an entire year of State University tuition each Christmas you lose perspective fast. Minimum wage jobs don\u2019t counterbalance that nearly as much as you think it will, especially when the bank of Mom & Dad is always open.", "Rich and oblivious", "It\u2019s the tackiness.", "I think you're missing the point. It's not about being rich but the way they went about it", "two comments did.", "wrecked the first one", "Lol no this is really considered wildly out of touch. \nThis is a problem with a weird glorification of being middle class so rich people insist they are middle class even when they clearly are not.", "I\u2019ve always considered my family upper middle class and my Christmas gifts have always been more Coach purse kind of money than YSL money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "their daughter comes over to see my daughter twice a week maybe because they\u2019re the same age.  she\u2019s not some random extended family member to me. and idk where you\u2019re going with the im \u201cobtuse\u201d but then i\u2019m not but then i am and then i\u2019m not. whatever.", "jesus christ. as i\u2019m sure you can understand, understand  people is a little bit harder on the internet than speaking in person.  i thought you were insinuating my children were \u201cfucked\u201d not simply correcting the sentence.  i apologize for misunderstanding.  i think it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to call me ignorant but alright.", "oh? wasn\u2019t trying to be \u201ctacky\u201d", "the way i went about it? so not consulting my cousin\u2019s daughter\u2019s mom, right?", "they had to get me a new one then lol", "girl, one year at your private school costs just about the same as a whole undergraduate degree\u2026 2 trips ABROAD per year??? u been rich rich", "it\u2019s ignorant to assume that you should spend thousands of dollars on a kid without even telling the parents. listen, it\u2019s great that you wanted to give the girl something that you thought she would like, your heart is in the right place, but your head isn\u2019t unfortunately. a majority of people can only dream of having the type of money you have, no parent wants to be one upped by someone else. a rule you should go by, is to always consult the parents first about the gift. believe me, it\u2019ll make things a lot easier. no one told my mom ahead of time what they were getting me and now i have 3 of the same curling irons.", "Uhhh they def were saying your kids are going to turn out fucked lmao I\u2019m pretty sure they were correcting the fact that you included the cousins daughter in that, because she will probably turn out okay", "And not thinking about the price and recognise that it's a super privileged position to be in", "haha that\u2019s funny with the curling irons! but yes, i will be sure to consult her mom next time!!", "i mean i just think it\u2019s crazy that people are basing how my kids are going to be based off of one christmas and what they got but it\u2019s fine, i know my kids are turning out to be amazing people so i\u2019m happy", "i do recognize that we are very fortunate in life to have the money we do!", "It\u2019s not based on simply what your kids got for christmas . It\u2019s about your entire narcissistic attitude, your lack of empathy, the condescending tone in the way you respond to people, etc", "It didn't really come across in the post and most people on reddit are always going to assume the worst of someone with alot of money.", "i\u2019m not trying to sound condescending at all and i think that this is a downside of the internet because no one can really hear tone in a text!"]}
